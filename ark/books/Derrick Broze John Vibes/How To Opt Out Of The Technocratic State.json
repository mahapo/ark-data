This technology provides benefits but comes at a cost—corporations, governments, law enforcement, and hackers are all capable of peering into ou r lives at any moment. Corporations and governments are even learning to use t echnology in a way that allows them to be the \"s ocial engineers\" of society. T he concept of social credit is also becoming increasingly popular, and the li kelihood that citizens will face negative conse quences for choosing to speak about controversial topics or criticizing authorities is only going t o increase. This shift toward a world where digital technology is the solut ion for all things is being driven by the tech sector—specifically the institutions o ften referred to as Big Wireless and Big Tech. The CEOs of transnational corporatio ns and their partners in government have worked to cement digital technology into every aspect of humanity. The world they envision is one where scient ists and technologists are the elite class who decide the future of soci ety. While the digital technology of these industries has only emerged in the last few decades, the philosophy which guides many of the leading figures in industry and government is nearly a century old. This philosophy of a rule by technological experts and scientis ts is known as Technocracy. As we will see in the coming chapters, the ideas w hich underpin this school of thought have quietly been influencing world lead ers for decades. Is this obscure political theory from the 20t h century the guiding force behind the move towards a digital dystopia? What are the implications for a world that is always plugged in and on \"the grid\"? How can one maintain privacy and liberty in a society that is based on mass surve illance, technological control, and the loss of individuality? I believe the answers to these qu estions lie in the writings of political philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III. Konkin was an activist during the 196 0s when talk of revolution in America was at its peak. He believed that using v iolence to overthrow the State would only r esult in another leader steppin g in and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 continuing the charade. Konkin also rejected voting, seeing it as participating in an immoral system as well as an inadequate strategy for achievi ng lasting change. Rather than voting or violence, Konkin proposed a third path for the freedom seeker which he termed Counter-Economics, and more spec ifically, Agorism. We will explore his work in detail in the coming chapt ers. Whether Konkin's vision of freeing the people from the chains o f the State becomes reality completely depe nds on the consciousness of the people. After enough people have been educated a bout the dangers of the Techn ocratic Era, there must also be an understanding of the power of non-complia nce. If a mass of people find ways to avoid the digital corporate-state we can le verage our numbers and the power of the count er-economy. We can create mor e freedom and opportunity to live the lives of abundance we desire. The window is short, but we have t he opportunity to remove ours elves from the State's matrix of control. The c urrent social credit system emp loyed in China will soon make its way to the United States and the rest of the \"civ ilized world.\" It has already become nearly impossibl e to live a life that is not mon itored and analyzed from cradle to grave. If we plan to survive this quick ly approaching technocratic corporate-state cont rol grid, I believe we must em brace the solutions first identified by Samuel E. Konkin III. It's time to recogniz e that Agorism and Counter-Economics are the answer to our problems. One final note: As I type these words in December 2019, I do so with the full awareness that digital technology is evolving at an exponential rate. The invasive technology of today might appear quaint or even archaic to some one reading this in 2025. I will admit that even the solutions contained within this book may end up outdated in less than a decad e depending on th e direction ou r technological world takes. However, no matter what the future looks like my message to you is never surrender . Find ways to adapt. Build communities with other like-minded people. Keep the flames of liber ty alive in your heart and mind s. As long as the human spirit desires to be free , we can and will find a way to overcome all hardship. No matter what year you discover this book, please us e it as inspiration and a foundation upon which to build. Humanity's future in in your hands. - Derrick Broze, January 2020 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Part 1: Technocracy, Counter-Economics, and the Future of Freedom The following chapters offer a brief introduction to several co ncepts including Technocracy, Counter-Economics, and Agorism. In the interest of getting to the \"how to\" aspect of this presenta tion we are only going to give an overview of these ideas. For those who want to understand the larger implic ations of the technocratic movement I recomme nd author Patrick Wood. If you a re interested in a more robust understanding of Counter-Economics and Agorism , I recommend my own book Manifesto of The Free Humans , as well as Samuel Konkin's books. I also highly recommend reading Konkin's final unfinished book Counter-Economics which is included in Part 3 of this work.  "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 1. What is a Technocracy? In the early 20th century, a movement began to develop around a political theory known as Technocracy, a system wh ere management of governments is handled by technical experts, often involving technology-focused soluti ons. The proponents of Technocracy claimed the concept would lead to bet ter management of resources and prot ection of the planet. However, this system of governance by technological experts and their technology would also involve a loss of privacy, centralization , and management of all human be havior. Although the term appears to have been l argely forgotten, the technocrat ic philosophy and influence can be seen everywhere in our modern dig ital world. One of the most influential pr oponents of Technocracy was a man named Howard Scott, a writer who founded the Technical Alliance in Ne w York City in 1919. Scott believed business owne rs lacked the necessary skill s and data to reform their industries and thus control should be handed over to engineers. In 1932, Scott and fellow technocrat Walter Rautenstrauch formed t he \"Committee on Technocracy\" at Columbia University. The group would eventua lly splinter, with Scott leading Technocracy Incorporated and technocrat Haro ld Loeb in charge of the Continental Committee on Technocracy. In 1938, Technocracy Incorporated released a publication which outlined their vision for a Technocracy (emphasis mine): \" Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical, engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics or Politicians, Finance or Fi nanciers, Rackets or Racketeers. Technocracy states that this method of operating the social mechanism of the North American Continent is now mandatory because we have passed from a state of actual scarcity into the present st atus of potential ab undance in which we are now held to an artificial scarcity forced upon us in order to continue a Price System which can distribute goods only by means of a medium of exchange."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 Technocracy states that price and abundan ce are incompatible ; the greater the abundance the smaller the price. In a real abundance there can be no price at all. Only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved. Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. The Technate will encompass the entire American Continent from Panama to the North Pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent, self- sustaining geographical unit.\" Technocrats publicized their vis ion of a centrally planned worl d with books, speeches, clubs, and political parties. This resulted in a brie f period of popularity in the U.S. and Canada in the y ears following the Great Depress ion of 1929. As politicians and economists searched for a solution to the finan cial calamity, the technocrats imagined a world where politicians and business own ers were replaced with scientists, engineers, and other technical expert s to manage the economy. However, in the 1940s mainstream i nterest in the Technocracy mo vement seemed to dissipate. Some researchers attribute this to a lack of a coherent political theory for achieving change, while others say Preside nt Roosevelt and the New Deal provided an alterna tive solution to financial hard ship. Regardless, Technocracy ceased to be a topic of mainstream political discou rse even as the industrial revolution spurred on new technologies and previousl y unseen wealth for those in control of said technology. The ideas that underpinned the technocratic vision received a n otable endorsement in 1970 when political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinsk i released his book Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era . Brzezinski will be familiar to long time r esearchers of the ruling elite. Until his death in 2018, Brzezinski was a diplomat who ran in the same circles as former Secretary of State and accused war criminal Henry Kissinger and David Roc kefeller. Brzezinski served as advisor to several presidents—from Jimmy C arter to Barack"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 Obama. Brzezinski was also a m ember of the Atlantic Council, th e National Endowment for Democracy, and th e Council on Foreign Relations. Brzezinski's Between Two Ages may have changed the term from \"Technocracy\" to \"Technetronic,\" but the depic tion of the future is the same: a world in which the scientific and technological elite centrally plan the lives of all humanity. Essentially, a technologically adva nced authoritarian-collectiv ism where individual liberties are subordinate to the apparent needs of t he collective. Brezinski explains Technetronic in the following way: \"The post-industrial society is becoming a \"technetronic\" society: a society that is shaped culturally, psychologically, soci ally, and economically by the impact of technology and electronics—particularly in the area of computers and communications. The industrial process is no longer the principal determinant of social change, altering the mores, the social structure, and the values of society... In the Technetronic society scientific and technical knowledge, in addition to enhancing production capabilities, quickly spills over to affect almost all aspects of life directly. Accordingly, both the growing capacity for the instant calculation of the most complex interactions and the increasing availability of biochemical means of human control augment the potential scope of consciously chosen direction, and thereby also the pressures to direct, to choose, and to change. \" Here are a few more choice quotes from Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era which make it clear that the goal is to build a global Technocracy: \"Another threat, less overt but no less ba sic, confronts liberal democracy. More directly linked to the impact of technolog y, it involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled and directed society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite whose claim to political power would rest on allegedly superior scientific knowhow. Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 would not hesitate to achieve its politic al ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public beha vior and keeping society under close surveillance and control. Under such circumstances, the scientific and technological momentum of the country would not be reversed but would actually feed on the situation it exploits.\" \"Persisting social crisis, the emergence of a charismatic personality, and the exploitation of mass media to obtain public confidence would be the steppingstones in the piecemeal transformation of the United States into a highly controlled society.\" “Today we are witnessing the emergence of transnational elites, but now they are composed of international busin essmen, scholars and public officials. The ties of these new elites cut across nationa l boundaries, their perspectives are not confined by national traditions, and their interests are more functional than national. Increasingly, intellectual elites tend to think in terms of global problems: the need to overcome backw ardness, to eliminate poverty, prevent overpopulation, to develop effective pea ce-keeping machinery. The concern with ideology is yielding to preoccupation with ecology, pollution, overpopulation and the control of disease, drugs, and weath er. There is a widespread consensus that functional planning is desirable and that it is the only way to cope with various ecological threats.” \"The fiction of sovereignty is clearly no longer compatible with reality. The time has come for a common effort to shape a new framework for international politics. There is already widespread agreement on developing international peace-keeping forces. Emerging global consciousness is forcing the abandonment of preoccupations with national supremacy and accentuating global interdependence.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Brzezinski's vision of the futur e was not mere speculation or g uesswork. He was a member of the ruling class who spent his life using nation st ates—and the people within them—as pawns in a c hess game in which most of th e players are dangerously oblivious to the r eality unfolding around them. I b elieve Brzezinski's book describes the world that is unfolding in the early 2020s. I highly recommend diving deep into his work for other fascinating insig hts into where we are and where we might be headed. Now that we understand a bit of h istory of Technocracy and some of the ideas that it proposed we need to exam ine the world of today to note the Technocratic (or Technetronic if you prefer) influence. Let's start by looking at the most wealthy companies and most i nfluential CEOs. These individuals are running comp anies which have amassed larg e amounts of financial wealth as well as unfat homable amounts of digital dat a on all of their customers. From Jeff Bezos at A mazon, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, Elon Musk of Tesla, and lesser known na mes at Google, Apple, and others, these are the technocrats of the ear ly 2020s. Interestingly enough, Musk appear s to be walking a path similar to his grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, w ho was a research director for t he Technocracy Incorporated of Canada and nationa l chairman of the Social Cred it Party. These men and their colleagues in various technological industr ies wield immense power through their com panies, wealth, and cultural inf luence. These individuals have e nough money, resources, a nd connections to sh ape elections, geoengineer the climate, and cause dips in the stock market, to name a few examples. They are the technocrat class of today. I want to remind the potential reader of the future that these names might not mean anything to you at this point—they may indeed be relic s of a long dead past. Whatever the names of the corporations, CEOs, and go vernments filling this role the concerns a nd possible solutions remain th e same. If technology continues to advance exponentially, then it is likel y that the trend towards surveillance will also c ontinue and with the decrease i n privacy, a decrease in overall liberties. This is what we seek to overcome. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Another example of the Technocra tic world involves the growing use of surveillance tools like facial recognition, voice detection, 24 -7 closed-circuit TV cameras, Artificial Intelligence, algorithmic manipulation, cel l phone surveillance, social media mon itoring, location tracking, digit al eavesdropping via smart devices, and the overall push towards a Smart Grid po wered by 5G. Of course, these technologies are not promoted as surveillance too ls but rather tools for safety, convenience, educati on, and profit. However, the re sult is the same: individuals and companies promoting technological solutions to the world's ills, resulting in a loss of individual freedoms and more centralized control. Of course, selling society on the need for a completely interco nnected digital world where technologists and scientific experts organize our l ives can be helped along with a healthy dose of propaganda from the State's favori te partner in crime, the corporate media. Brzezinski's Between Two Ages provides more insight into the Technocratic plan: \"In the Technetronic society th e trend seems to be toward aggregating the individual support of millions of unorganized citizens, who are easily within the reach of magnetic and attractive personalities, and effectively exploiting the latest communication techniques to ma nipulate emotion and control reason. \" Together the technocrats (aka Bi g Tech), their obedient friends in media, and their partners in government are becoming what I call the Techn ocratic State. The rest of this work is dedi cated to poking holes in this Tech nocratic State and exploiting its weaknesses. As men tioned in the introduction, those who want to maintain privacy and liberty must be willing to adapt to consta ntly emerging technologies with the potential to liberate or impriso n our hearts and minds. I believe the key to resisting the Technocracy can be found in the work of Samuel Konkin III and his theory of Counter-Economics. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 2. Counter-Economics and Agorism Note: Before we get to the \"how to\" of living a life outside the confines of the increasingly omniscient Technocratic State, we must understand the history and philosophy of Counter-Economics. This chapter includes a run down of the counter-economic strategy, including va rious definitions offered by Samuel Konkin III. The third chapter further breaks down the philosophy of Agorism. Both chapters were originally published in my third book, Manifesto of the Free Humans, but have been updated to better re flect the specific nature of this book. I include them here as a brief introducti on to the concepts of Counter-Economics and Agorism. It is my hope that this distillation of Samuel Konkin's work will help readers understand that these strategies can be empl oyed in your life—regardless of age, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, political affiliation, socioeconomic status, or any other division of the human species. Quite simply, Counter-Economics is a strategy that can be practiced by any one anywhere in the world. For readers who are new to this field of research, I recommend checking out Konkin's New Libertarian Manifesto and An Agorist Pr imer. For those who are familiar with Counter-Economics and Agorism, I recommend skipping ahead to Chapter 4. In 1979, anarchist, activist, a nd writer Samuel E. Konkin III ( SEK3) released The New Libertarian Manifesto , presenting his case for a stra in of libertarianism that he called “New Libertarianism.” The philosophy behind the New L ibertarian Movement was Agorism, named after the “agora,” the Greek word f or marketplace. We will elaborate on Agorism in a moment, but esse ntially itis a radical philosophy that seeks to create a society free of coerc ion and force by encouraging people to opt-out of the corporate-state control gr id. Konkin believed if a movement of people pulled their money, time, and support from corporate and state power, it would siphon away enough resource s to collapse the State. As the State collapsed t he agorists would help build sys tems that are not based on violence and coercion. Konkin called on individuals to e xit the mainstream economic sy stem because he was one of the first modern thinkers to recognize that the unre gulated market is the largest market in the world. Sometimes known as system-d, a lternative, or"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 informal economy, the value of this untaxed and unregulated mar ket has a market value in the trillions of dolla rs. Throughout history, when a g overnment or king has tried to enforce prohibition— be that drugs, alcohol, gambli ng, sex, or books—they inadvertently cause a growth in the underground econ omy or, as Konkin called it, the counter- economy. Upon recognizing that th e State has been incapable to slow the growth of the counter-economy Konkin saw an opportunity to disempower the State and preser ve liberty for the people. Konkin termed this strategy “Count er-Economics,” which he defin ed as the \"theory and practice of all human action neither accepted by the State nor involving any initiatory violence or threat of violence.\" Throughout the years, Konkin continuously refined his understanding and writing on th e topic, and in doing so he offered several definitions and background on Count er-Economics: \"An explanation of how people keep their wealth and property from the State is then Counter-Establishment economics, or Counter- Economics for short. The actual practice of human actions that evade, avoid and defy the State is countereconomic activity, but in the same sloppy way \"economics\" refers to both the science and what it studies, Counter- Economics will undoubtedly be used. Since this writing is Counter-Economic theo ry itself, what will be referred to as Counter-Economics is the practice.\" ( The New Libertarian Manifesto ) \"A Counter-Economist is (1) anyone prac ticing a counter-economic act; (2) one who studies such acts. Counter-Economics is the (1) practice (2) study of counter-economic acts.\" ( An Agorist Primer ) \"Counter-Economics is doing what you want , when you want, for your own good reasons.\" (Counter-Economics) \"Counter-Economics sounds like counter-culture; indeed, the term was chosen with that in mind. Where the Counterculture rejected an Establishment “culture”"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 and its values in the 1960s, the counter- economists reject the Establishment economics as just as corrupt. Much of the counterculture was counter-economic, much of it was not. Anti-economics is not Counter-Economics; in fact, Counter-Economics as theory was developed from what could be called an orthodox revolt against an heretical, impure, Establishment economics. \" (Counter-Economics) I have always seen Counter-Econom ics as a method of aligning yo ur actions with your stated goals and princi ples. If you don't support illegal wars of aggression, then find ways to avoid paying taxes or donate your taxes to a charity (see: War Tax Resistance). If you're tired of central banks manipulating the State's currency and enslaving you via funny money, then avoid the State's money , use alternative currency, barter, reduce your need for money, etc. Counter-Economics suggests that moral people break bad laws by choosing to consciously opt out of systems that do not align with their val ues. As Konkin wrote in the unfinished Counter-Economics : \" Countereconomic activity is any human action that takes place without the approval of the State. And since laws cover almost every human endeavor, often prohibiting both the action and its corresponding inaction, everyone to at least some small degree must bend or break laws simply to exist .\" Being a counter-economist means that when you run into a roadbl ock to your liberty and health you find a way around it. This can include u sing or creating alternative currencies, commun ity gardening efforts which provi de an opportunity to be free of big corporate grocery stores, tax res istance, operating a business without licenses so your hard-earned money doesn't go to the State, and more. Counter-Economics also exte nds to the creation of alterna tive education programs, free schools or skill sh ares, and independent media v entures that counter the establishment narratives. The reality is that the counte r-economy is all around you. Ever y time someone pays a neighbor in cash to mow th e lawn or do handiwork, they a re participating"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 in the counter-economy. The tra nsaction does not involve taxes going to the State and the cash makes it a non-digital, untraceable transaction. I f you have ever shopped at a garage sale, flea market, or pop up shop and not p aid taxes—or perhaps even paid with an alte rnative currency—you have been a counter- economist. Of course, most of the public who participate in the counter/underground/alternativ e economy do not realize the pote ntial and likely have never heard of Konkin or Cou nter-Economics. He believed a raising in the consciousness and awareness of the power of the counter-economy could create a mass movement of people exiting th e system and building new way s outside of the Technocratic State. For a deeper understanding of Konkin's work let's take a look a t his writing on Agorism. It is important to note that one need not self-identif y as a new libertarian, libertarian, agorist, or anarchist to appreciate a nd make use of Counter-Economics. Simply put, one can practice Counter-Economi cs for the benefits it offers in escaping th e Technocracy while not comple tely agreeing with Konkin's theories. However, I sha re this research because I bel ieve his ideas offer a viable path forward. Understanding Agorism In the New Libertarian Manifesto , SEK3 outlines his vision for a more free and just world by first describing society’s present condition: Sta tism. Statism is the tendency for citizens of a nati on to view the State as the mech anism for which change can be brought about. Thus , a statist is someone who bli ndly trusts in the authority of the State and always reaches to the State as the s olution to society's ills. Konkin briefly outlines the path of human thinking, from slaver y to the discovery of libertarian thought, and emphasizes the importance of consis tency between means and ends. Indeed, Konkin be lieves that exposing Statist i nconsistencies is “the most crucial activity of the libertarian theorist.” From here, Konkin describes the goal of Agorism and the counter-economic means ne cessary to achieve this goal. In order to paint a clear picture of the agorist struggle for a more free world, Konkin explains the four stages from Statism to Agorism as well as various"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 actions that a consciously prac ticing agorist might seize upon in order to advance agorist propaganda and counter- economic activity. By understand ing Konkin’s vision of progress it is possible to create a diagram to outlin e how far society as a whole has come and where we, as individuals, fit within these s teps. After the steps have been mapped it will be possible to pinpoint strategi es that can help the new libertarian move from one stage to the next. Konkin begins in “Phase Zero: Ze ro-Density Agorist Society.” Ph ase Zero is the time when agorists did not exist and libertarian thought was sc attered and unorganized, which Konkin says has been “most of human history.” Once libertarians became aware of the philosophy of Agorism, counter -economic activity began and we moved into “ Phase 1: Low-Density Agorist Society.” In this phase, the first counter-economic libertarians appear. Konkin believed that this was a dangerous time for ac tivists who would be tempted by “Get-Liberty- Quick” schemes. Konkin also remi nds agorists not to be tempted by political campaigns. “All will fail if for no other reason than Liberty grows individual by individual. Mass conversion is impossible,” he wrote. Phase 1 is presented at a time wh ere the main goal of the few practicing counter- economists is recruitment and creation of “radical caucuses\"—or what I call Freedom Cells. Konkin also notes that the majority of society is acting “with little understanding of any theory but who are induced by material gain to evade, avoid, or defy the State. Surely they are a hopeful potential?” In order to achieve the free so ciety Konkin again emphasizes th e need for education and “consciousness-raising of count er-economists to libertarian understanding and mutual supportiveness.” SEK3 also called for the creation of a movement which may grow str ong enough in influence and number s in the latter stages of Phase 1 to be able to “block marginal actions by the State.” The ability to block actions by the St ate has absolutely increased in recent years with the explosion of decentralized, p eer-to-peer networks via the I nternet that allow for rapid sharing of informati on and calls to organize. There i s a growing number of videos on the Internet show ing communities banding together to oppose unjust arrests by agents of the State. For example, the websites and apps FreedomCells.org, NextDoor.c om, and GetCell411.com offer tools that can be used to strengthen our c ommunities, grow"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 the counter-economy, and push back against the State. By using the Freedom Cell Network, one can locate other freedom-minded individuals w ithin their city, state, or country with the specific goal of organizing in the r eal world and bypassing the need for government. In 2016, we launched FreedomCells .org as an online platform for building mutual aid groups known as Free dom Cells which we will explore in detail in the next chapter. NextDoor also allo ws the user to connect with the local community, both digitally and in the real wor ld. The app has the added ben efit of being focused on a specific neighborhood. This allows individuals to post important safety information, lost and f ound items, or counter-economic b usiness opportunities directly to those who live near them. Finally, Ce ll411 describes itself as a “real time, free emergency management platform.” This means it allows you to create “cells” or groups to which you can send ou t direct alerts in the case of a flat tire, car accid ent, violence from an agent o f the State, or some other emergency. The app also a llows for truly agorist rideshar ing where a third party does not dictate the price of the trip or the currency th at must be used. Note: Once again, to the potential reader of the future, if these apps and websites have been made irrelevant due to time and technological advances, it is important to ensure we as free people have alternatives to the State and corporations. Each of these tools are a part o f the technology of the counter -economy which have the potential to render gove rnment intervention and regula tion completely useless. If we seize the moment we can grow the black and grey markets using these emerging peer-to-peer platf orms. This is exactly what Kon kin believed would help society progress from Phase 1 to Phase 2. As we move to “Phase 2: Mid-Den sity, Small Condensation Agorist Society,” the statists take notice of Agorism. Is it in this phase that Konki n believes the counter-economy will grow and a gorists will begin to represent “an ever-larger agorist sub-society embedded in the statist society.” Although the majority of agorists are still living within t he State’s claimed territorie s we begin to see a “spectrum of the degree of agorism in most individuals.” This includes benefactors of the State who are “highly statist” and “a few fully conscious of the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 agorist alternative,” however the majority of societ y is still engaged in the Statis t Economy. From here, Konkin suggests that a gorists may want to start cond ensing into districts, ghettos, islands, or space colonies. We are in fact beginning to see the creation of agorist minded communities, seasteaders, eco-villag es, co-ops, and underground spaces which emphasize c ounter-economic activity an d the creation of counter-institutions to the St ate. Konkin believed these ago rist communities might be able to count on the sympathy of mainstream society to prevent an attack from the State. This is the moment where the qu estion of community protection a nd defense comes into play. We have seen the creation of community protect ion alternatives to the police state monopoly (see the Threat Management Center in Detroit and the Autodefensas in Mexico), but thus far nothing completely ag orist has come into existence. It is the creation of these syndicates of commu nity protection which will ultimately allow the agora to flourish. However, for this to happen “the entire society has been contaminated by agorism to a degree,” leading to the possible creation of an above or underground movement which Konkin called the New Libertarian Alliance (NLA). The NLA simply acts as the spokesperson for the agora and uses “every chance to publicize the superiority of agorist living to statist inhabiting and perhaps argue for tolerance of those with ‘different ways’.” This brings us to “Phase 3: High- Density, Large Condensation, A gorist Society,” which is described as the point when the State has moved into a terminal crisis period due in part to “the sapping of the State’s resources and corrosion of its authority by the growth of the Counter-Economy.” As the agora grows in influence the State’s stranglehold also dissipates because of u nsustainable economic practices. Konkin again warns that the statists will a ttempt to win over new libertarians with “anti-principles” and calls for maintaining “vigilance and purity of thought.” Highly motivated new libertarians move into R&D to help create the first agorist protection and arbitration agencies th at will compete with the State. At this point, government exists in pockets with the State mostly concentrated in one geographic territory. Those living under st atism are very aware of the freedom being experienced by their agorist counter parts. The State has become weak enough that “large syndicates of market protection agencies”"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 can contain the State and defend new libertarians who sign up f or protection- insurance. This, Konkin believed, was “the final step before the achievement of a libertarian society.” Society is divided between the larger agorist areas and the isolated statist centers. The transition from Phase 3 to Phase 4 brings about “the last unleashing of violence by the ruling class of the state.” Konkin said that once the State’s intellectuals recognize that their authority is no longer respe cted, they will choose to attack. Defense against the St ate will be managed after the counter-economy has generated the syndicates of protection agencies large enoug h to defend against the remaining statists. The NLA should work to prevent the State from recognizing its weaknesses until the agorist movement has compl etely infected the statist society. Once the agorist communities have successf ully resisted the State’s attack, the agorist revol ution will be complete. As we move from Phase 3 to 4, Konkin notes that the first three changes “are actually rather artificial divisions; no abrupt change occurs from first to second to third.” However, he envisions the change from the th ird to the fourth phases to be “quite sudden.” In Phase 4, \"Agorist Society w ith Statist Impurities\", the Stat e has gasped its dying breath and the counter-economy becomes the freed market w here exchanges are free of coercion. Konkin predicts that “division of labor and self- respect of each worker-capitalist-ent repreneur will probably eliminate the traditional business organization—especia lly the corporate hierarchy, an imitation of the State and not the Market.” He imagines companies as associations of independent contr actors, consultants, and entre preneurs. After the remnants of the State are apprehended and brought to justice, f reedom becomes the basis of ordinary life and “we tackle the other problems facing mankind.” Whether the totality of Konkin’s vision becomes realized, the w orld has at the very least made some slight progress through the phases predict ed in the New Libertarian Manifesto . All signs point to the count er-economy and consciously practicing agorist movement to be somewhere at the tail end of Phase 1 and merging into Phase 2. As menti oned above, the Internet (and tec hnology as a whole) has greatly increased the chances for success of the Kon kian revolution. While humanity is being exposed to the value of a life free of coercion, they have not yet been properly exposed to the tools with which to create such a world.

Kon kin believed that once the people recognize the Stat e is weakened and in decline, they will naturally gravitate towards the counter-economy, leading his ag orist vision to become reality. Clearly the people of the world have a desire to exchange their goods and services without oppressive, elitist barriers to entry in the m arketplace. The people desire to voluntarily associate and exchange without int erference or intervention. This desire will always lead to the creation of counter-economic activity in the black and grey markets as long as the “mainstre am” statist economy is subject to the whims of the current puppets in contr ol. However, seeking to escape the State’s regulation is not the only goal t o our agorist and counter-economic strategy. The endgame is a stateless society where free people are not bound by the force and coercion of the parasitic state and corporate class. Though it is rarely discussed in public schools or the mainstre am media, there are several examples of stateless societies and communities existin g throughout history. For those interested i n studying past stateless societ ies, I recommend studying James Scott’s The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia ; A Century of Anarchy: Neutral Moresnet Through the Revisionist Lens ; and Pierre Clastres’ Society Against the State .

Vertical and Horizontal Agorism “As more people reject the State's mystifications—nationalism, pseudo- Economics, false threats, and betrayed political promises—the Counter-Economy grows both vertically and horizontally. Horizontally, it involves more and more people who turn more and more of their activities toward the counter-economic; vertically, it means new structures (bus inesses and services) grow specifically to serve the Counter- Economy (safe communica tion links, arbitrators, insurance for specifically \"illegal\" activities, earl y forms of protection technology, and even guards and protectors). Eventually, the \"underground\" breaks into the overground where most people are agorists, few are statists, and the nearest State enforcement cannot effectively crush them.” - SEK III, Applied Agorism, An Agorist Primer We are going to take a look at two different types of counter-e conomic action that are applicable to a variety of individuals in a range of l iving situations. I refer to these strategies as Vertical and Horizontal Agorism. W e are working with two complementary definiti ons of horizontal and vertical t hat further explain the “how to” of agoris t philosophy. These definitions a re taken from the above quote from Samuel Konkin III and from Swedish Austrian ec onomist Per Bylund and his 2006 essay A Strategy for Forcing the State Back . Let’s compare the definitions and see how they can provide a path for the cur ious counter- economist. Konkin starts by describing the counter-economy as growing hori zontally in the sense of an increasing portion of the mainstream population tur ning their activities towards the non-statist economy. Vertical growth, in the Konkian sense, involves the actual creation of counter-institutions to the statist counterparts. This means building alternatives not only to the economic power centers via alternative currenc ies but alternatives to the dead stream corporate media, the corporate food productio n systems, the compliant aca demic centers, and the growing non-profit industrial complex."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 Per Bylund describes his vision of vertical Agorism as the “int rovert” strategy based on the work and ideas of r adical libertarian Karl Hess. H ess was an extremely eloquent speaker and speechwriter who grew from conse rvative to libertarian anarchist to a more l eft-leaning community organize r and activist. During the 1960s, he was heavily involved in organizing on camp us during the rise of the new left and anti-war student movements. Hess worke d with Murray Rothbard, Konkin, Carl Ogelsby of the Students for a Democratic Society, and several others in an attempt to forge alliances between the eme rging new left and libertarian movements. He was al so one of the few people to hav e 100 percent of his wages stolen by the IRS fo r challenging the income tax. In the 1970s, Hess shifted the fo cus of his activism to experim ent in community building within the low income neighborhood of Adams-Morgan in Washington D.C. In his books Community Technology and Neighborhood Power Hess outlines how he worked with the l ocal neighborhood to build an empowered community focused on sustainability — or what they termed “appropriate technology.” Hess describes a n eighborhood with aquaponic garde ning in basements, rooftop gardens, and community services meant to rep lace the State options. He was adamant that tools and technology directly cont ribute to freedom. By being able to share tools with your community membe rs you can share access to the means of pr oduction and encourage entrepren eurship. It is this focus on community em powerment that Per Bylund refer s to as the vertical or introvert strategy. These actions can be considered agorist in the sense that they are aimed at building self and community reliance rat her than dependence on external forces, but they are not explicitly coun ter-economic because they do not involve black and grey markets. Still, thes e vertical actions are extremely valuable and necessary. Vertical Agorism includes partic ipating in and creating communi ty exchange networks, urban farming, backyard gardening, farmers markets, s upporting alternatives to the police, and supporting peer-to-peer decentr alized technologies. While these vertical steps could potentially involve the use of the State’s currency (and therefore not compl etely counter-economic), they are still significant for challenging the dependency on the State and cor porate classes."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 Other vertical steps may not d irectly involve exchanging curren cy but still work against dependency. This could include both moral support and p romotion of technologies that disrupt the status quo and foster stronger re lationships among community members. One very pronounced example of ve rtical Agorism is seen in the growing alternative media which has been made possible by the Internet. Less than one generation ago, the mainstream m edia, owned by mega-corporation s and tightly regulated by government, controlled all of the information that filtered down to society. The distribution of information in society came from t he top down making it very easy to brainwash and propagandize the populatio n. However, with the rise of the Internet activists and freedom-seeking ind ividuals discovered they could use this new medium to create their own media, becom e journalists themselves, and fight back against the propaganda of the State. In just a few short years, the alternative media qui ckly upset the monopoly of the mainstream media, taking up large portions of their once exclusive market share. The surge of independent media provides an excellent example in our study of how alternative systems and institu tions can be created to compete with existing State monopolies. (Unfortunately, the Cor porate-State nexus has perme ated social media as well and censorship of independent voices is now perva sive as of 2019.) The goal is to question and cha llenge the mechanisms of power t hat seek to influence and rule over our liv es. This includes the State as w ell as other institutions that attempt to exe rt control and influence. For e xample, by choosing to grow your own food or support local farmers, you are taking a vertical step away from the biotechnology corporations that promote the heavy use of pesticides and a potentially hazardous technology. You are also not supporting the transportation of food produc ts from thousands of miles awa y. Instead, you walk to your backyard or the local market for your produce. Thi s greatly increases your independence while t erminating support for an un sustainable industry. These vertical steps are also the easiest ways to beg in living in line with your principles. Once again, we can see the value of consistenc y of words and actions. Per Bylund describes the horizontal, or extrovert strategy, as more directly related to Konkin’s ideas. The extrovert label is related to th e bold choice to"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 pursue actions the State consider s to be illegal or immoral. By venturing into this territory you are joining the ranks of the bootlegger, the moon shiner, the cannabis dealer, the guerrilla gardener , the weapons dealer, the crypto -anarchist, and the unlicensed lawn mower, food vend or, or barber. When one combine s the vertical and horizontal agorist strategy an image comes into view that i llustrates the steps a wide range of people can take in a variety of living situatio ns and environments. In the bottom left corner we have Statism and in the top right corner we have Agorism. We can plot vertical actions that help lift the indivi dual up from dependency. Perhaps your situati on is better suited to vertical actions such as growing your own food, using encrypted messaging, hosting commu nity skill shares at your house, practicing peaceful parenting tactics, pr oviding alternatives to State welfare by crowdfunding money for community projects a nd feeding the homeless, or simply cleaning up the neighborhood. Each of these steps moves the individual (and in the long-term , the community) vertically tow ards consistency and independence. For those who are ready to become counter-eco nomists and take on the risks of grey and black market activity we plot the ir actions both vertically and horizontally. An agorist practicing horizontally and vertically would move up and away from Sta tism and dependency to the top r ight position of Agorism.

When Konkin first espoused the concept of Agorism the conscious ly practicing counter-economy may have only in volved a few radical libertaria ns. But since that time the opportunities for black and grey market exchanges have grown immensely. As the State’s wea knesses become apparent it will be come safer for the masses to begin exiting the former economy and joining the counter- economy. This is the truly freed market or agora of which Konki n spoke. Remember we cannot defeat the Tec hnocratic State by using their technology blindly as this will only serve to empower them. We must create and support alternatives to the State’s monopo lies whenever and wherever po ssible. It will take brave counter-economists ven turing into uncharted territor ies, making mistakes, occasionally falling victim to the State’s laws, and learning how to better our approach. We need these pioneers to lay the groundwo rk so that others will not have to face the same di fficulties in the future. As t hese trail blazers light the way. we also expect to see a growth of free communities and freedom networks around the world. I have a vision of thousands o f interlocking autonomous communi ties comprised of empowered individuals with a v ariety of unique ideas and exp ressions of the human experience. These communities are voluntarily trading and sharing skills without the violence inherent to our current paradigm and witho ut the constant invasions of privacy. I believe t his world can be achieved with an organized effort to spread agorist philosophy and increase participation in the counter- economy via Vertical and Horizont al Agorism and the concept of Freedom Cells which we will cover in Part 2. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 4. The Drawbacks (And Solutions) to Living the Counter-Economic Lifestyle The reasons one chooses to opt-out of “traditional” institution s and societal expectations vary from person to p erson, but generally people a re looking to stop supporting systems they do not agree with. Whether we are talki ng financially (to avoid taxation) or philosophica lly (on moral grounds), many of us who live outside of the mainstream syste m do so because we disagree with the people running these systems—and in som e cases, the system altogether. We do not want to fund these governments by complying with taxa tion. We do not want to support the monopolized banking system and the bank s that rob the people. We do not want to violate our moral compass or principl es by participating in these charades . Instead, we take steps to begi n removing ourselves from these systems as qui ckly (and safely) as possibl e. We each have a different goal and different per spectives on how far to push th e effort to opt-out and vacate these systems that pro mote authoritarianism and fina ncial theft. However, what unites us is our belief that people should be free to organize their own affairs without the interference of centralized autho rity in the form of government or monarchs. Put simply, we acknowledge that every individual owns themselves and should be able to live free of i nterference, extortion, threats of violence, and forced compassion. When I came to these conclusions , I had an internal shift that was so profound and simple: I will no longer participate in systems I do not support . First, I stopped using banks because I saw t he results of the 2008 finan cial crisis and I learned about the many economic crises created by banksters thr oughout history. Second, I refused to use a credit card and never attempted to e stablish a credit line through these banks. I also stopped driving because I didn ’t want to get a State ID and instead only use a passport. By the end of 2010, I came to understand the nature of war and violence being perpetuated by the American Empire and decided I would no l onger pay an income tax. I stopp ed filing and have made efforts to keep my inco me below the Poverty Line. I a lso stopped working jobs which compenstated me in the form of a check. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 Since that time I have started a couple of businesses of my own (without filing paperwork for city licenses) and only accepted cash, silver, or cryptocurrency. All of my income has been in me tals, cash, digital payments, or bartering. Obviously, I am still paying a sales tax when I am not shopping at a farmers market or buying directly from a gray market entrepreneur, but the goal is to take steps towards completely opting- out. It doesn’t happen overnigh t and it doesn’t come without struggle. Let’s take a moment to look at some of t hese struggles and their potential solutions. First, what are the potential downsides to not using a bank? Be fore we answer that question we should note that there are alternatives to the big banks, including local credit unions and co-ops. T hese institutions are typicall y more connected to the local community and not involved in economic theft. However , do your research and use these alternativ es at your own risk. One criti cism of going bank- free is a fear of lack of security when not storing funds in a traditional banking institution. The fact is, you can put your trust in a banking i nstitution and the U.S. government, or you can choose to take personal responsibil ity and store your money under the mattress, in a safe, in a private bank, or anywhere else you please so as long as you are ta king proper security measures. Beyond the security risks, there a re also financial downsides t o not using banks. I recently received payment in the f orm of a check for a media gi g. Not only was I forced to visit a bank to cash the check (Bank of America, no l ess), but I was taxed $8 by the bank to cash my check for not opening a bank ac count. Now, this problem is easily remedied by ongoing education about the value of not using banks (or government backed mone y) and the power of alternative currencies. Unfortunately, we are still at a point where too few people kno w and understand these values, resulting in limited options in the market. The c ompany that sent me the check is an old media c ompany whose employees are ignora nt to agorist philosophy, Counter-Economics, a nd digital payment options. The likelihood of my convincing them to pay me in silver or crypto is not high. T his is important to remember because until we have bu ilt a completely parallel syst em that offers an alternative to the current parad igm – in every area of our live s – we will occasionally have to conduct busin ess with people who are still filing taxes and therefore keep a record of every financial transaction. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 Another recent issue I have encountered involves the renting or purchasing of property. In my case, I was atte mpting to rent an apartment in a big city, but these obstacles apply elsewhere as well. Because I have rented through different people for years, it has become increasingly difficult to do s o on my own as I have less and less records to s how to potential landlords or Re altors. In the most recent case I found several potential properties, contacted the property owners, and attempted to negotiate my wa y into a new home. I have no pr oblem paying rent on time, but my lack of check stubs causes issues with ind ividuals looking for traditional forms of payment. Again, when I attempt to explai n that I receive money from supp orters via Patreon, money via this crazy t hing called cryptocurrency, and some money in cash, they usually look at me with a confused expression on the ir face. I explain that I can show them payments r eceived via Paypal but that does not seem to satisfy either. From there, prope rty owners tend to ask to see a bank statement. When I say no, they are baffled and then ask for a tax record. When I tell them I don’t have that either, they look at me as though I have person ally disrespected their mother. By the end of these conversations I am being told they cannot rent to me because I have no way to verify my income. So what is the solution to these problems? The most obvious sol ution is education. Those of us who value the idea that all moral people should opt-out of immoral systems and create new ones, ought to spend our time an d energy educating others about the value of such actions. The more peop le who understand this concept, the more entrepreneurs there are optin g-out and creating value in the counter-economy. Now as far as the banking situati on, cryptocurrencies are showing th e world what digital decentraliz ed banking looks like. The more energy we put into supporting (or creating) alte rnative currencies – digital or otherwise – the less power the centralized banking monopolies have. As far as solutions for renting an apartment when you live most ly outside of the system, I believe blockchain t echnology offers hope. Blockchain is the peer-to- peer, digital ledger technology behind Bitcoin and other crypto s. To understand how blockchain can help, we have to think about why Realtors an d property owners want to see documentati on from a bank or a government. T rust. Security.

We are taught to trust and coope rate with these institutions. The average person does not trust or believe some one is authentic or valuable or rent-worthy if the y do not possess such documentati on. So imagine if every week when I am paid for the articles I writ e, I take a screenshot of the digital payment (or a picture of someone payi ng me cash for a job well done) and post it on a blockchain. The blockchain is d ecentralized, meaning posts cannot be altered or deleted. If I continue to po st my weekly income statements on a blockcha in, I would have a decentralized and transparent record of my history or any ot her documents I chose to place on the blockchain. In fact, this could already happen by making posts on a website like Steemit. If the Realtor or property owner understands blockchain or is will ing to learn, they can feel secure because there is a record of my pay. We could e ven sign a contract together on the blockchain. This would allow for trans parency and security on both sides. I believe solutions like this are the future and we are startin g to see this unfold. For the moment there are difficulties as we agorist pioneers la y the groundwork for the counter-economy and the next stage of human evolution.

Counter-Economics In the Digital Age Up to this point we have shared the history of Technocracy, the strategy of Counter-Economics, and Agorism. W e also explored how the counte r-economic path has the potential to be th e solution to our digital dystop ia. Now we will discuss the solutions to living a life as free from the grip of the Technocratic State as possible. In addition to being an anarchist philosopher, Konkin was also a fan of science fiction. These two interests me rged with his \"discovery\" of Cou nter-Economics, for it was his appreciation of the sci-fi genre which lead him to propose that technology could play a role in freeing the people from the cha ins of bondage and expand the counter-economy. K onkin died in 2004, shortly b efore social media, cryptocurrency, and dig ital encryption became mainstream . Long before bitcoin or cryptocurrency emer ged, Konkin was discussing simila r concepts and predicting that new computer t echnology would facilitate counte r-economic activity. However, Konkin was not a fool. He realized that the authorities would use the emerging digital technology to expand state control. As someone who has spent the last seven years promoting Konkin' s ideas, I recognize that the Technocratic S tate threatens to remove the a bility to safely opt out of the corporate-state syst em. We are in desperate need for solutions to maintain the anonymity and privacy needed to safely navigate th e counter- economy under the digital dystopian world we are now living in. It is not clear if Konkin could see the direction in which the world was headed wh en he left this planet, but I have found myself contemplating this issue. Which brings us to the following conversation. What does it mean to be a counter-economist in the Age of the Surveillance State? How can one participate in the underground economy when Big Brother is always watching? Will it be possible to st arve the State once social credit scores become mandatory? Let's start by examining the current landscape of the world con cerning digital surveillance and overall privacy .

T he middle class and higher are falling in line with the latest fad of smart everyth ing, surrounding themselves with technology that can listen, record, and/or watc h their daily lives. From door bell cameras to home assistants and TVs that are alwa ys listening, the masses are voluntarily abandoning p rivacy in the name of entert ainment and convenience. Simultaneously, law enforcement a nd government agencies continu e to claim they need all manner of high tech gadgets to prevent terrorism and violent crime. Cell phone surveillance tools, license plate cameras, facial re cognition cameras, radars that can see through walls , secret surveillance planes, social media monitoring, DNA collection, gait detection, voice detection, an d threat scores – these tools are increasingly available to departments willing t o pay up. There are also semi-private mega corporations buying up every bit of data they can find on potential consumers. This data i s used to sell us things we don 't need, monitor our daily habits, and will eventu ally pressure every individual to be obedient to the Technocratic State under thr eat of punishment and exclusion from the digital world. In 2019, consumer tech organization Comparitech found that the United States, China, Malaysia, Pakistan, Indi a, Indonesia, Phillipines, and T aiwan were the worst offenders when it came to protecting the privacy of peopl e’s biometric data. Comparitech said that these nations use biometric data to a \"severe and invasive extent.\" Indeed, the Technocracy is a growing problem around the world. In the U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) has bee n fighting for years to keep secret a database containing hundreds of millions of \"face prints\" from American citizens and non-citizens alike. It is important to note that facial recognition technology is not j ust about scanning someone's fac e. Newer software is also learning to eva luate (and predict) your emotio ns and state of mind. The FBI has also been wagi ng a war against encryption, fe arfing that the people might develop an unbreakable code and thus maintain some level of privacy. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 The U.S. Transportation Safety A gency (TSA) has begun testing f acial recognition technology at select airports for international tra velers with plans to expand the program in 2021 and 2023. The U.S. government has ex pressed interest in expanding the program to all travelers. The plans f or this type of biometric control grid in the U.S. were set into motion by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and expanded af ter the attacks of September 11, 2001. However , there has been some successful push back against the Technocracy. As of December 2019, three different U .S. cities have banned or regulated facial recognition software pending further study. In November 2019, France became th e first European country to u se facial recognition technology as part of a nationwide digital identity for citizens. The new government app is operated by using facial recognition and will give users access to around 500 government web sites. Those who choose not to participate would theoretically be locked out of accessing these government websites. Citizens of India are already finding themselves locked out of the Aadhaar biometric ID program. Under this system reports have begun to e merge detailing instances of citizens being refu sed access to services due to A adhaar glitches and ultimately dying of starvation as a result. The program launche d in 2009 with the goal of giving every single Indian citizens a unique, biometric ally verified identification number. By the e nd of 2019, an estimated 1.2 bil lion Indians were enrolled in the program. Users ha ve their iris and/or finger pr ints scanned and then receive a unique 12-digit num ber linked to their biometric and demographic data. They will then use this ide ntification number when gettin g married, setting up a bank account, paying taxes, s igning up for a cell phone co ntract, or even when starting a digital wallet. Again, it appears obvious that those who find a way to avoid the system will be l ocked out of mainstream societ y. China is perhaps the best curre nt example of an advanced author itarian Technocratic State and likely the model for the rest of the wor ld. Another 2019 study from Comparitech reported that eight of the top ten most- surveilled cities in the world can be found in China. By 2022 China is projected to have one public closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera for every two pe ople. The estimated 200 million CCTV camera s are part of a \"Skynet\" netwo rk active across China.

In December 2019, the Chinese gove rnment implemented a new rule requiri ng China's 854 million Internet u sers to use facial identification in order to apply for new Internet or mobile ser vices. Equally disturbing is the ongoing rollout of the nationwide soc ial credit system. Starting in 2009, the Chinese government began testing a nation al reputation system based on a citizen's ec onomic and social reputation or \" social credit.\" This social credit score can be used to reward or punish certai n behaviors. By late 2019 Chinese citizens were losing points on their score for dis honest and fraudulent financial behavior, playing loud music, eating on pu blic transportation, jaywalking, runni ng red lights, failing to appe ar at doctor appointments, missing job interv iews or hotel reservation witho ut canceling, and incorrectly sorting waste. To raise one's social credit score a Chinese citizen can donate blood, donate to an approve d charity, volunteer for comm unity service, and other activities approved by the government. The Chinese go vernment has begun to deny millions of peopl e the ability to purchase plane and high-speed rail tickets due to low social credit scores and being labeled \"untr ustworthy.\" This is the world of the early 21st century. If we assume techn ology will continue to advance exponentially then it is probably a safe bet that th e surveillance and privacy concerns are here to sta y. Unless there is some sort of resistance to these dangers privacy will be completel y eroded within a decade. For the moment these technologies are mostly vol untary. For example you don't have to buy the latest digital home assistant device and you don't have to carr y a cell phone with you everywhere you go. This means you have the power to decide what type of products and companies you suppor t with your purchases and how you interact with technology. We don't have t o blindly submit and opt-in to every latest tech update or advancement. The more immediate and threaten ing element of the Technocracy i s the State.

But if everyone around us is still opting-in it is likely they will choose not to associate with those who have a low social credit scores. Some people will do this out of fear that their own score will decre ase for hanging out with \"untrustworthy\" types.

This is the real power of social engineering. As we outlined above the Technocra tic State is growing around t he world. This means at some point in the near future YOU will have to make a choice.

Find ways to reach others and educate them about the dangers. This might involve fi ghting for political change on th e local level, passing out flyers, phone banking, or social media campaigns. I understand we cannot all be full-time activists, but each of us can find a wa y to contribute to the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 goal of creating a community of people who voluntarily choose t o opt-out of the Technocratic State. Of course, t he closer you are to a big city and \"civilization\" the harder it will be to avoid the growing Technocracy. 2. Exit and Build - This involves leaving your b ase of operations behind and moving to a location with less i nvasive practices and less tech nocratic corporate- state influence. If you have decided you are living in an area that has no hope and would rather start fresh then you should exit and build somethi ng that reflects your values. This could be done solo, as a couple, with family, and even with friends. Perhaps you purchase land , share living space, or live adjacent to each other in a neighborhood. No matter what the living situation th e intention here is to build a community that would provide some level of safety an d privacy for those who opt out of the mainst ream technocratic world. I want to stress that this option is not necessarily about ba iling on your home. As I will outline in the chapter on the Counter-Economic Underground Railroad, choosing to exit and build before the shit hits the fan might help your close friend s and family down the line when it really matters. More on that later. 3. Apathy is Death - Of course, you are always free to do nothing. Perhaps you see what's on the horizon and decide that A) it's too late to s top the Technocracy, B) it's too much work to make an effort, or C) you are just try ing to take care of your own family and live a peaceful life. I could go on, but yo u likely get the point. It's your life and you are not obligated to take any act ion upon learning of the Technocracy and the digital dystopia being built. However, I would warn that apathy today will only make life more difficult for the generat ions of the future. If we want to preserve and expand liberty and privacy for all p eople we are going to have to take action in realistic and tangible ways. Of course we could brainstorm a dozen more options, but general ly I believe all plans can be sorted into one of these three categories. For tho se choosing Option 1 it is important to understand that deciding to stay put while attempting to opt- out of the Technocracy will involve breaking the law at some po int. As the State continues the push for mandatory biometrics (retina, fingerprin t, and face scanning) and social credit systems are adopted widely, it will become increasingly difficult to operate your life without directly vi olating the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 Technocratic State's orders. The t rick is to determine the pote ntial risk vs the potential benefit. As Konkin once wrote, \"trade risk for profit.\" With the understanding that every decision we make is economic (wh ether it relates to money or no t), Konkin recognized that choosing to viola te the commands of the State w as a risk that could result in a profit in the form of an increase in liberty in one form or another. So when you choose not to report all of your income on your taxes in order to save money for your fam ily you are trading a risk for a benefit. In a similar way if or when the State issues mandatory vaccination o rders, mandatory retina scanning, mandatory micro chipping, or any other mandato ry program you will have a choice. You can submit to these programs out of fea r of punishment or damage to reputation, or you can consciously choose to opt-o ut of these systems. There will be risks and there will be benefits. It is up to you to decide what is best for you and your family. In his unfinished book Counter-Economic s Samuel Konkin described what he calls Low-Profile and High-Prof ile Counter-Economics, two diffe rent tactics available to those who seek to opt-out of invasive systems. Whi le Low-Profile Counter-Economics involves discreetly opting-out of the Technoc racy, High- Profile is more in your face. \"High-Profile Counter-Economics deals with a particular area of State coercion by calling attention to his or her victim ization. The more noise, the better. The famed Chicago 8 used publ icity to keep themselves out of prison for years—even after their convictions. Civil disobedients trust public pressure to keep them out of jail or to minimize their penalties. Indeed, the State’s en forcers are wary of creating martyrs. The very concept of martyr exhibits the power of Information; what is a martyr but a corpse with a good story? "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 High-Profile Counter-Economists have high er risks because they are so easy to detect. They gain the advantage of additional information flow—from themselves to the rest of the market. To the extent they succeed, they beco me inspirational.\" Konkin said those who pursued both Low- and High-Profile simult aneously could do so through a third cat egory: The Counte r-Economic Comm unity. Konkin notes the benefits of having allies who are also partici pating in the counter-economy and opting-out o f the Technocracy. This is why it is going to be important to form some level of a community as a mutual support network that allows for a life \"off the grid.\" Konkin wrote: \"One may pursue any degree of notoriety (or, to put it another way, freely advertise one’s services) w ithin the community of fellow counter-economists while not informing the State, its agents, and, of course, its informers. To do that, one needs to control the flow of information about oneself.\" One of the great insights outlined by Konkin in Counter-Economics is the importance of controlling the flow of information about yoursel f, \"in particular, the information flow from you to the State.\" Konkin says the two obvious ways to escape the State's notice is to not exist and \"if you do exist, don't tell anyone about it.\" The goal then is to reduce inte raction with the State and/or p rivate companies who want to scan your face, record your life, and for ce you to submit. There are many ways to approach this goal. For example, Konkin noted that some aspiring counter-economists have chosen to \"cut themselves off from contact with anyone who might get to know them, get and stay off all mailing lists, operate through cash and never use banks, and even avoid legal residences, living in trailers as nomads or on neglected land in caves or makeshift structures.\" While this may sound extreme to s ome, for a brief period in th e 1960s these individuals promoted t he philosophy of Vonu, or inv ulnerability toward coercion, and attempted to avoid all contact with the St ate. Tom Marshall, aka Ryo, was the main proponent of Vonu and often wrote about f inding his version of freedom by completely opting out of society and livi ng solitary in the wilderness or in his RV. Some of those who choose Option 2 may be interested"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 in Vonu, but in my experience most people seem interested in li ving with their family or in a community of lik e-minded people who do not want to submit to the digital prison rather than alone. If any lesson is learned from the proponents of Vonu it is that opting-out is absolutely possible whether in a high-profile counter-economic manne r or an extreme low-profile Vonu lifestyl e. ( For those interested in a deeper look at Vonu I recommend checking out Vonu: A Strategy for Self-Liberation by Shane Radliff) Both Konkin and Ryo warned of the difficulties facing those see king liberation and privacy within the city. How ever, in the increasingly inter connected digital world in which we live privacy can be difficult even in rural a reas. Whether you choose to Hold Down The Fort and build community in the city or town you live or Exit and Build your community in a new location, the goal is to limit interaction with the Technocra tic State. This is where we can l earn from the Vonu enthusiasts who talked about \"interfacing\" with the rest o f society on a selective basis. Konkin says one way to interface w ith the \"overground or establ ishment economy\" (or mainstream world in general) is to create a fictit ious identity who takes the risks. In this case you can drop this identity at a m oment's notice if necessary. In the digital world it is easy to create an alterna tive persona online, but it is more difficult to be truly disconnected from your onl ine identity. In my journalism career I have seen governments track people with pho nes, cameras, computers and GPS and even crack encryption. As Konkin notes, \"if the State’s agents are closing in on this alter-ego, as long as you wear the guise they are closing in on you. \" Additionally, anything you gained while using the false identity—accounts, contacts, and property—would be lost. Konkin viewed false personalities as valuable, but ultimately h e believed it was necessary to categorize your information flow into a system of layers. For example, at one layer you must r eveal some information in order to interact with the rest of the world. This information can include \"that you have a product or service, how much it will cost, what you will accept in payment, how you can be contacted, and when are you or it avai lable. If there are multiple payments, credit arrangements, repeat business, and post-sale follow-up involved, still more information must flow from you.\" "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 When purchasing or selling a prod uct, working for an employer, or traveling you will leave a digital paper trail and also are more likely to fa ce the biometric tools of the Technocracy. Again, if you live in a major city (or even a small city) and choose Option 1 these are challenges you will have to face. In the U.S., China, UK, France, Australia, India, etc., CCTV cameras connected to 2 4-hour \"Real Time Crime Centers\" and \"Fusion Centers\" keep civilians in most major cities under heavy surveillance. Increasingly these cameras are being outfitted with facial recognition software. To combat this threat there are tw o main strategies that I call \"Be Invisible\" and \"Seek & Destroy.\" Be Invisible If your goal is to remain low-profile and Be Invisible there ar e few actions you can take immediately: ● Stop carrying cell phones everywhere you go ● Stop using GPS ● Delete social media account s and apps that track you ● Stop using credit and debit cards ● Cancel your bank account (use a credit union if you need to sto re your funds) ● Stop working jobs in the mainstream economy ● Stop paying taxes Now, obviously some of these opti ons are going to be extreme fo r some people. It's all about the level of information flow you are willing to accept. Some people can't quit their day jobs or cancel their bank accounts or dele te their social media accounts. I get it. This means th ere will be some level of info rmation about you available to those with the money and the desire to buy it. The re's nothing inherently wrong with this. Per haps your major concern is simpl y making sure the cell phones and home assistants are not listening to you al l the time. So you choose not to buy an Alexa, Echo , etc. and you choose to only t urn your cell phone on when you need it. These are personal choices and they will differ with every individual. The point is that you are in control of the d ata flowing out from you. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 When it comes to the digital world there is still an incredible value to understanding how to use encrypti on. The number of digital devi ces you use directly correlates with your level of privacy and liberty. If your wifi, phone, laptop, tablet, etc. are all oper ating without any type of encr yption you are at the mercy of all manner of bad actors . There is also the matter of off the shelf computers being built with backdoor s which allow government and private companies to access your data w ithout a problem. Of course, usi ng VPN's (Virtual Private Networks) is va luable but documents leaked by Edward Snowden proved that the U.S. N SA can crack these as well. One t ool discussed by Konkin that is still valuable is public-key cryptography. We don't have the space here to elaborate further, but I recommend learning more about cryptographic privacy and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption. I will add one final caveat about digital communication: assume someone can see it. Even if you are using encrypt ed messenger apps that promise to destroy your messages instantly it is a safe assumption that the American an d Chinese governments can access it if they so choose. All digital commun ications can be collected, stored, and analyzed i f someone wants it done. Alway s operate as if someone else can see what you ar e sending. If something sensiti ve needs to be communicated then say it in per son in a room without computers, phones, smart devices, or digital home assistants. There are also some practical w ays to fight back. In 2019 there were several stories reporting that activists had found ways to fight back a gainst the surveillance grid. In Chile, activists pointed lasers at drones observing their behavior from the skies during massive anti-government protests . Hundreds of lasers pointing directly at the drone caused it to malfunction and fall to the floor with a thunderous applause and ch eers from the people. In Hong Kong, protesters also used lasers to fight against surveillance. To fight agains t facial recognition cameras the activists began using high-powered lasers aimed at cameras and police. As the corporate-state advances it is likely they will discover how to avoid falling prey to simple laser s, so it is important that th e people are always looking for (or creating) adva nces in technology that can count er the State. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 Some companies and designers hav e recently begun advertising cl othing, face paint, glasses, and even certain h air styles that might be able to bypass facial recognition. Berlin-based artists Adam Harvey has launched two different projects seeking to overwhelm and confuse facial recognition sy stems. His Hyperface project involves printin g clothing with eyes, mouths, and other facial features in an attempt to deceive the software. Harvey also wor ked on the CV Dazzle project which sought to use makeup and hairstyle to inte rfere with the machines. Other artists have sugg ested that clothing that is sh iny, reflective, and can bounce light as well as military style camo could disrupt t he facial recognition nightmare and render you invisible. Of course the most practical way to protect your face is to cov er it. There are several options available for tho se interested including paper masks, the infamous Guy Fawkes (\"Anonymous \") mask, and 3D printed faces de signed to give you another identity altogether. However, in China the Sta te has made masks illegal and seeks to punish a nyone who would obscure thei r identity. This has not stopped intrepid activists from continuing to use facia l covers, but again the point is that if you want to protect your privacy it will l ikely involve breaking the law. If a law violates our right to liberty or privacy, the n it is the law itself which is unjust and it should b e ignored. However, it should be noted that in a world full of facial recognition cameras someone with a mask wi ll surely stand out and be detected within momen ts. The less attention you brin g to yourself the better. Seek & Destroy Before we go any further please note that this information is f or educational and research purposes. You are fully r esponsible for your actions. Now for those who are dissatisfied with simply avoiding the invasive technology a nd playing a digital game of cat and mouse the Seek & Destroy option might b etter suit your needs. We can look to Hong Kong again for another example. In August 2 019, activists targeted “smart lamps” that the l ocal government says are used to collect data on traffic, weather, and air quality . Activists feared the smart s treet lights had been equipped with facial recognition software so they tied ropes ar ound the poles and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 pulled them down to the ground. T here are about 50 smart lamppo sts installed around Hong Kong, all of which have cameras and sensors. These are the same kind of smart lamps being installed in \"Smart Cities\" around th e world. Again, I recognize this might sound extreme to some, but I have met a diverse crowd of people who have expressed that if the technology comes to their neighborhoods they will tear it down. This brings us to the topic of monkeywrenching, a form of direct action originally popularized by elements of the radical environmental movement, specifically Earth First! a nd the Earth Liberation Front (ELF). Dave Foreman co-founder of Earth First! outlined the tactics of monkeywrenching in his book Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching . Foreman's book itself was inspired by Edward Abey's book The Monkey Wrench Gang which tells the story of four individuals who used sabotage to protest environmenta l damage in the Southwestern Un ited States. Between 1992 and 2007, the Earth Liberation Front began sabotag ing construction projects that threatened wild lands and forests. T heir tactics included tree sitting, non-violent blocka des, civil disobedience, and di srupting machinery. One need not agree with the philosophy or even the cause of the ELF and Earth First! to recognize that monkeywre nching can be applied to a nu mber of different causes. I would say what the Hong Kong protesters did to the sm art lamps was monekywrenching in defense of pri vacy and liberty. As always, y ou decide the risks vs the potential benefits. To those who are uncomfortable with the idea of destruction, remember that every ending breathes a new beginning . We can build a world that respects privacy and individual liberty on t op of the ashes of the Technocratic State's f acial recognition cameras. These are just a handful of sugg estions on strategy and tactics for maintaining some level of privacy and liberty. As Konkin correctly noted th e fight for privacy is a \"dynamic, evolving system. It is a non-violent form of an arms race where one side cracks the code and the other develops a new system to top the old one.\" Digital technology is a tool and like every tool it can be used for good or for harm. In the hands of the technoc rats digital tech is used for control, spying, social engineering, manipulati on, censorship, and propaganda. I n the hands of free people technology can be used to heal, empower, educate, a nd build a better"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 world. However, this better world will not happen without a con scious effort to build it. We also need a healthy skepticism towards emerging te chnologies which are sold as the panacea to human ity's turmoil. Whether you choo se to stay put and build in your town or vacate the State and build elsewhere, it will be necessary to participate in some level of community if only for survival. Our best chance for survival is to band together with others who choose to opt out of the digital future and form new co mmunities which respect privacy a nd liberty.   "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 6. The Counter-Economic Community: Freedom Cells Throughout his writing Samuel Konki n refers to the benefits of existing with an agorist, or counter-economic co mmunity. Although Konkin never c ompleted a detailed outline of how this comm unity might operate he does ma ke a few helpful references. In the outline to Counter-Economics , under the heading \"Chapter Fifteen: Psychology Counter-Economics,\" Konkin wrote: \"Mutual Reinforcement—Going beyond individual self-reliance and self- acceptance, the concept of individu als working together counter-economically, developing trust and honest interdependence, will finally be developed (after popping up briefly all over the book). Be yond relationships and affinity groups, we come logically to the idea of an active sub-society and/or Movement of Counter-Economists—and that brings us to Part II.\" Unfortunately, Konkin never wrote Part 2 or elaborated on the c ommunity angle. The reality is that whether you choose to Hold Down the Fort or Exit and Build community is going to be necessar y to survive the Technocracy. I have spent the last few years developing the c oncept of Freedom Cells, which I believe lines up perfectly with the counter-economic vision. Freedom Cells are p eer-to-peer groups made up of seven to nine people (with eight being ideal) organizing themselves in a decentralized ma nner with the collective goal o f asserting the sovereignty of group members through peaceful resistance and th e creation of alternative institutions. Freedom Cells (FCs) can be seen as a very specific type of mutual aid group where Agoris m and Counter-Economics play a key role. The name comes as a response to State propaganda around “Terror Cel ls.” I am consciously choosing to reclaim t he language and build cells th at spread freedom. Also, FCs act like cells in a bod y that are performing importan t tasks individually while also serving the goals of th e larger organism. From this view, every FC is playing a vital role in spreading counter-economic activity whi le also forming a part of the larger network tha t will foster exchange of ideas a nd products between different cells. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 The number of eight participant s is drawn from the research of Bob Podolsky and his book Flourish!: An Alternative to Government and Other Hierarchies . Podolsky is the protege of resea rcher John David Garcia who spe nt twenty years researching how to maximize the creativity of a group of people working together on a joint project. After performing hundreds of exper iments, he came up with an optimized model based on groups of eight, which he c alled an octet or octologue. The idea is that a s hortage of individuals would lea ve the group limited in capability, but with too many people the group is bo gged down with disorganization and a lack of focus. Podolsky recommends formin g octologues made up of four men and four women guided by specific ethical t enets. Although Freedom Cells are also promoted as groups of eight individuals collaborating together, they differ from octol ogues in that they are heavily focused on decentralization. While Bob Pod olsky has outlined a detailed vi sion of how an octologue should operate, I hope t o provide examples of applica tions for FCs without telling other FCs how to operate. The needs of each com munity will naturally differ. Beyond a genera l agreement to respect each ot her’s right to be free of coercion I believe FCs should not be monopolized by the vision of a single cell. I caution the read er to remember that these ideas are a guide and not the final word on the literally limitless possibilities. In the beginning, individuals can work together to accomplish g oals such as every group member having three months’ worth of storable food, encrypted communication, a bug out (or Exit and Build) plan, and ensuring participants have access to firearms (or some form of self-defense) and know how to use them safely and proficiently. All the while cell members make t hemselves readily available to render mutual aid t o their cell in whatever form t hat may be necessary. After you have establis hed seven - nine people withi n a FC each individual should be encouraged to then go on their own and sta rt another FC, especially if the original membe rs are not living in close prox imity to one another. Living reasonably close to each other will allow for a quick response time in emergency situations. On ce again, every member of the F Cs should be encouraged to start additional cells. Eventually the original cell would be connected to seven or nin e additional cells through individual members for a total of 70-90 people. Imagine the strength and influence these cells could exert once connected in the digital world via"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 FreedomCells.org and in the physi cal world where possible. The creation of the Freedom Cell Network also serves as a social network for travel ers looking to do business in the counter-economy w ith other like-minded people. Through building and supporting alternatives such as local food network s, health services, mutual defense groups, and peer-t o-peer economies and communica tion networks, FCs will be better ab le to disconnect and decouple th emselves from the Technocratic State. Once groups b ecome large enough in numbers it becomes quite possible for participants to opt-out en masse and to secu re their liberty. This is the model we followed w ithin The Houston Free Thinkers activist community and The Free Thinker H ouse community space. We began by building gardens and selling the crops via the Nextdoor communi ty. We also sold juice and kombucha tea made usi ng fruits harvested from trees o f neighbors who understood our goals. We started with a small group of about th ree to four people meeting and discussing the goals a nd themes of our cell. The go al is to have skills and knowledge diffused thr oughout the group. This way if one person leaves the group the knowledge is not taken from the cell. For example, knowing that every cell member can pe rform CPR, use encrypted communica tions, shoot a gun, or communicate the counter- economic message may be importa nt for your cell. Obviously, certain indivi duals will be more skilled or kn owledgeable in some areas, but there are founda tional skills and information t hat should be common among all cell members. Our group also used the structure to educate each other on spec ific topics of interest. Perhaps your FC meets and agrees to learn everything available on permaculture or a particular philosophical concept. You can the n choose to divide the topic up among your ce ll and return two weeks later to educate each other. Perhaps your cell joins the Cell411 app and responds to emergency alerts in your community. Several cells could join together to cop wat ch or actively resist and disarm violent police or other agents of the State. A Freedom Cell could connect with other cells f or a covertly organized guerril la gardening action. With the constant barrage of fake news coming from the establis hment media a FC could quickly research and de bunk incoming propaganda. FCs c an organize alternative exchange networks th at encourage local artisans and entrepreneurs to sell their unregulated crafts and accept alternative currencies . In a “Shit Hits the Fan” scenario, FCs could have p rearranged bug out locations sto cked with"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 supplies. If several FCs were e qually prepared, you now find yo urself with a small community of empowered individuals as opposed to being fo rced to defend yourself alone. When it comes to dealing with t he Technocracy, FC members can m ake commitments to limit the amount of information which is communi cated via digital technology, saving impor tant conversations for face-to- face. Additionally, members can share tips for evadi ng the watchful eyes of the Sta te. However, the real value of using Freedom Ce lls to build the counter-economic community is strength in numbers. If your deci sion not to adopt the mandator y biometrics or social credit goes from frowned upon to illegal you will face p unishment for choosing not to participate. As we noted earlier, the goal of s ocial credit schemes is to socially engineer society t o be blind, dumb, and obedient followers of the Technocracy. The State is going to use the Technocracy to promo te the idea that anyone who chooses to opt-out is th e problem. Even the most str ident individualist will find it hard t o survive \"off the grid\" once the Technocracy is complete. Of course, the social credit score will also discoura ge friends and family from associating with t hose who have been blacklisted. The solution is to collaborate w ith other individuals and famil ies who choose not to submit. The reasons for optin g out will vary from person to person—some may opt-out to avoid mandatory vaccinations, others to practice their religious beliefs in peace, while still oth ers will exit to protect the p rivacy of their future progeny. Frankly, if the choice is mandatory obedience to the S mart Grid or a life \"outside\" of mainstream society , it will take a coordinated eff ort by many determined individuals to create a world of networked communiti es where individuals can thrive, raise their families, conduct business, and trade while still living free. I believe the concept of FCs can help those of us who will do anything to be free from the web of the Technocracy. In conclusion, I offer these “12 Tips For Building Freedom Cell s” as a starting point for launching your group . Please adapt these to the speci fic needs of your community: 1. Understand Your Motivation - I find it valuable for every person considering starting a cell/circle/hub to know why they are pursuing such a goal. What are"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 your motivations and interests? Knowing this before you start a group will save you time. Finding ways to opt-out of the Technocracy is an obvi ous goal, but what else drives you? 2. Identify Potential Candidates - Are they mentally, physically, spiritually sound for your goals? 3. Discuss Common Themes - What are the driving forces bringing the group together? 4. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses - Take an honest look at the strengths and weaknesses of each individual as well as the group as a who le. 5. Evaluate Desired Level of Freedom vs Security - Every individual may have a different desired level of fr eedom and as such will have diff erent aims and acceptability of risks. When it comes to the Technocracy this i s especially important to remember. How free do you really want to be? How m uch privacy do you want to keep? What will you do to attain such a goal? 6. Set Short Term and Long Term Goals - What can your cell accomplish in three months? Six months? A year? Set goals as a group and hold each other accountable. 7. Mindfulness Training - Incorporate practices like Nonviolent Communication Training and group meditation into your cell. 8. Accomplish Goals - Document each goal successfully met by the cell or individual members. 9. Ongoing Group Education, Communication - Continuously expand your cell’s knowledge, skills, and supplies. 10. Promote/Market Goals and Accomplishments - Use the power of social media (when safe) and marketing to let the world know how much more prosperous you are in the counter-economy. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 11. Identify Strategies For Creating Income/Independence - Leverage the power and number of your cell to c reate counter-economic income that cannot be taxed by the State. 12. Network with Other Cells - The key to opting-out of the Technocratic State is building the counter-economic community. This means not only your immediate community of allies but the larger network of cells i n your city, state/province, nation, and the global community. It is up to y ou to make an effort to network with other activists and free thinkers.   "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 7. The Counter-Economic Underground Railroad For the last two years, I have focused on developing potential solutions for liberating hearts and minds from the grip of the Technocracy. I have come to the conclusion that whichever path you choose to take proper precau tions and emergency plans are necessary. The cliche hope for the best, prepare for the worst applies here. While I have offe red suggestions to those who ch oose to Hold Down the Fort, it is imperative that some individuals choose to Exit and Build in the event that the \"fort\" coll apses. These forward thinking ind ividuals may choose to move out of major citi es to rural areas with less inv asive practices or move to a nearby region with relatively more liberty and privac y. The goal is to establish a network of free communities that could serve as saf e havens for refugees of the Technocratic State. This is what I call the \"Co unter-Economic Underground Railroad,\" or simpl y the Underground Railroad. This Counter-Economic Underground Railroad is modeled after the original \"Underground Railroad\" of the Am erican colonial era. In the lat e 1700s, former slaves, abolitionists, and sympat hetic civilians formed a decen tralized network of safe houses that allowed slaves to escape from bondage. Most of the freed slaves made their way north to Canada but there were also safe houses helping people escape south to Mexico. It has b een estimated that as many as 1 ,000 slaves escaped per year between 1850 an d 1860. The Underground Railroa d was inherently counter-economic becau se under the Fugitive Slave Ac t of 1793 law enforcement in free states were required to help slaveholders r ecapture runaway slaves. Fortunately, many officials had the good sense to ignor e the unjust law and help former slaves make the ir way to freedom. This was a co nscious decision to violate the State's demands a nd trade risk for a perceived b enefit. In the notes to his unfinished chapters \"Smuggling Counter-Econ omics\" and \"Human Counter-Economics,\" SEK3 me ntions the Underground Railro ad as an example of people smuggling. In \"Smuggling Counter-Economics\" h e writes, \"Smuggling 'people' is introduced, to be used in the 'Human Counter-Economics' Chapter, with underground railway of the Civil War period. \" It is important to note there i s a difference between smuggling a person voluntarily and involuntary human trafficking done under the th reat of violence."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Smuggling typically involves choos ing to transport goods which the State has deemed illegal or avoiding taxes on the transportation of said goods. People or human smuggling involves one individual paying another to be sm uggled across international borders. While sm uggling typically involves some form of contractual agreement that ends upon arrival to the destination , human trafficking involves the use of force, abduction, fraud, or coercion. This is often used to induce forced labor or sexual exploitation. Simply put, smuggli ng becomes trafficking when the element of force or coercion is introduced . Under Konkin's counter-economic theory, human s muggling is legitimate because it does not involve the initiation of violence or coercion. In \"Human Counter-Economics\" SEK3 provides a little more detail of his vision: \"Underground Railway slaves moved count er-economically, variants of it still in use; Refugees covers Counter-Economics of freeing people from greater tyranny, Minority groups are covered here first, how they survive in hostile societies, and the sub- societies they form, us ually overwhelmingly counter-economic... \" Although we don't have the finishe d work, it is interesting tha t Konkin mentions minority groups and \"how they survive in hostile societies, and the sub-societies they form.\" In the age of the Technocratic State those choosing to opt-out will be the minority groups surviving in hostile societies. The sub-soc ieties we form could be the free communities wh ich keep the flame of liberty b urning into the future. Imagine the Freedom Cell Network expanding to both urba n and rural environments around the world. Those who stay in the cities do what they can to combat the Technocracy and educat e others of the dangers.

The allies who smuggled former slaves across in ternational borders also risked their free dom for a just cause. These are t he same decisions I believe many of us will face in t he coming years as the Technoc ratic State continues to grow. The individuals who choose to Exit and Build now can purchase land, build housing, and lay the foundation of a more free society. While t his will initially serve to provide for their own f amilies, if the shit hits the f an the Underground Railroad will help slaves of the Technocracy escape to these co mmunities. This is the role I am choosing to tak e. I do not believe my place of birth (the United States) is salvageable. I do not see this as abandoning ship or giving up hope but rather I am consciously choosing to build the future I desire w ith the understanding that others may need help in the near future. I b elieve by exiting the city, moving to a less invasive region of the world, and bu ilding on land I will find my inner peace and have an opp ortunity to help others.

As in the original Underground Ra ilroad we will need sympatheti c individuals within the hostile society who are willing to house and transpo rt those seeking safety. We will need low-level employees of the State willing t o take a bribe or simply turn a blind eye to the Counter-Economic Underground Rai lroad. We will need \"white hat\" hackers willing to create technological tools tocombat the omnipresent eyes and ears of the smart grid. We will need indiv iduals who leave behind comfort to develop the n etwork of free communities that might soon house refugees of the Technocracy . Finally, we will need organi zers who can help connect each of these indivi duals in as decentralized a ma nner as possible. I do not claim to know exactly how this Counter-Economic Underg round Railroad will develop. The only th ing I know is that it must de velop as soon as possible. If we choose to sit by idly while the Technocratic St ate comes into view we are abandoning future genera tions of our human family.

Final Thoughts on Surviving the Digital Dystopia In late 2009 I began questioning the world around me and wonder ing who was running the show. I consumed as much material as I could find o n the history of government, banks, the ruling cl ass, and power. For a moment I was convinced that the end of the world, a gove rnment collapse, a police stat e, or something of that sort was coming. Over time my fears receded as I took a mo re reasoned look at the world around me and als o took note of the many positive advances unfolding in that world. Unfortunately, as I write these words my fears of an impending doom have returned. Only now I see the impending thre at coming from what I am calling the Technocratic State. This State is unlike any other previously seen in humanity's hi story. There is an elitist, totalitarian ruling class made up of the technocrats a nd mad scientists combined with digital technology not available to past totalita rian regimes. This does not bode well for the future of liberty for all people. Th e modern conception of liberty is barely 300 years old itself and it appears as if humanity may have trouble maintaining and expanding such a necessary principle. A pparently humanity is still deciding whethe r concepts like privacy and li berty will continue to thrive. Will liberty expand to all lands of the Eart h or will the tyrants continue to reign? I don't pretend to know exactly how the future is going to turn out, but I do know the outcome will be determined by those who choose to step up a nd take action. The direction will depend on the values and the principles of t hose who get engaged and seek solutions. Tho se who sit on the sidelines will merely be cogs in someone else's machine. The tim e for passivity has come to an e nd. If you do not want to lose privacy and eventually all liberty you must ac t to protect yourself and your loved ones. The Technocracy is coming into full view and everyday it become s more clear that the masses will swallow the poison without hesitation. Opt ing-out of the conveniences and pleasures of the smart grid will not be a popu lar choice. Saying no to mandatory biometric syste ms will involve some level of ri sk.

Counter-Economics provides a philosophical foundation to the simple act of saying \"no\" to immo ral or unjust state rules and doing what you must to thrive. The facts are all there: when th e State moves to prohibit an ac tivity or a substance they create a counte r-economy of people who will volu ntarily choose to violate the State's demands and do what they feel is necessa ry to survive and thrive. This counter-economy is one of the largest economies in the world and none of it is controlled by a centralized authority. The power of Counter- Economics lies in recognizing the potential of a mass opting-ou t of systems that do not align with our values and are inherently immoral. Just a s in the original Underground Railroad I am calli ng for the creation of safe hous es, the transporting of refugees, and the conscious objection to laws w hich try to criminalize those who help runa ways. The \"conductors\" of the or iginal Underground Railroad did what t hey knew was right because it ma ttered more than blindly following words on pieces of paper. We should take inspiration from th is example of counter-economi c activity and consciously opt-out of the tec hnocratic control grid. If we for m Freedom Cells which promote counter-economic activity and encourage skepticis m towards the Technocracy we may have a chance to form a competing society of free communities that choose to reject v arious levels of invasive di gital technology. We cannot face this monumental ta sk alone. It is of extreme imp ortance that we find a way to form alliances a nd coalitions in the interest of saving our collective liberty. I believe opting-out of the T echnocratic State should go hand i n hand with opting-out of the military-industrial complex (MIC), the centra l banking system, the school system, the corporate- media complex, and the pharmac eutical complex. This will not be easy or even possible for all people in all situations. Do what you can, where you can. Refer back to Vertical and Horizontal Agorism when you need ideas for opting-out of a wide range of instituti ons and organizations that do not repr esent your interests.

We need not all take the exact same route to achieve success. In fact, the more diverse the field o f individuals employing the counter-economic eth ic the better off we will be. Each of us will be inspired and motivated by different stimuli, and we will eac h reach and inspire different people.

Konkin III began devel oping his philosophy of Agorism and the strategy of counter-economics in t he early 1970s before writing the seminal New Libertarian Manifesto . The book laid out the black market-anarchist platform in all its glorious detail. Konkin's second book, An Agorist Primer , was released after his death in 2004. The wor k further illuminated the path to what Konkin called New Libertarianism or Agorism . Before his death Konkin was intending to release another book known as Counter-Economics. Konkin envisioned the book as an academic tome that would rival Marx's Communist Manifesto . Unfortunately, the book was never completed and Konkin's vision for the release was not realized. Thanks to Konkin,s friend Victor Koman, what survives of the book has now been released to the public in digital format. Aft er hearing that Konkin had an unfinis hed and previously unseen book that was to be released, I decided I would \"finish\" the work as a sort of thank you to the original agorist for his effort to demonstrate the effectiveness of the economy that exists outside the tyrannical grasp of The State. Upon reading the completed six c hapters and the outline to the entire book I becam e overjoyed at the possibilit y of bringing the book to life. However, the book you hold in your hands is not the same vision Konkin outlined. I do not know if I am capable of creating a book that would satisfy Konkin's ambitious plan. Rather than attempting to recreate Counter-Economics as Konkin described, I decided to take Konkin's final work and update it to make it relevant to the 21st century and beyond. I believe Konkin's essays and my additions are key information fo r any individual or community i nterested in participating in counter-economic activity as a way to create m ore freedom in their lives. I give all credit to Samuel E. Konkin for laying d own the foundation on which myself and many other counter-economists build.

The other four have not been located as of January 2020. I present them to you as they were written by Kon kin and edited by Victor Koman.

Konkin argued that all that was ne cessary was to raise the cons ciousness of the average person to recognize the opportunities that wait in the untaxed, unregulated counter-economy. If a mass of principled, consisten t individuals resisted the extortion of the State and moved their energy into the counter- economy the State would become i mpotent. From the 1980s until h is death in 2004 Konkin recognized some of the earliest evidence of the suc cess of the counter-economy. As we head into the 2020s the evidence is even greater than Konkin might have imagined. Yet once again we are confronted wi th the question —what do we do about it? Do we take the evidence before us and use it to inform our actions as any reasonable person might? Or do we ignore the obvious solution in favor of continuing to play the political divide and conquer game?

It was originally published as the afterword to the ePub Edition o f Counter- Economics: From Back Alleys to the Stars, the inspiration for How to Opt-Out of the Technocratic State) The author of Counter-Economics, Samuel Edward Konkin III, died February 23, 2004 at the age of 56. He left his original manuscript with me in the hopes that a three-time Prometheus Award reci pient and publisher (KoPubCo Bo oks) would shepherd the book to publicati on, much as I had with Konkin’s N ew Libertarian Manifesto (KoPubCo, 1983 & 2006) a nd the posthumously published introductory book An Agorist Prim er (KoPubCo, 2008). The latter manuscript only required a light amount of updating, which allowed it to b e published fairly quickly (by libertarian st andards) after his death. Counter-Economics, on the other hand, proved to be a greater c hallenge. The manuscript, written around 1984-85, consisted only of the first six chapters out of twenty in his outline (although fo ur more chapters are rumored to exist somewhere in digital form, but h ave yet to be found). Moreover, extensive quotes from contemporary news and magazine sources constituted a signi ficant portion of the manuscript. Because these references are now dated — for example, the Soviet Union’s underground econom y provided him with voluminous illustrations of statist economi cs gone utterly awry and Venezu ela, the current poster-child for socialism’s horro rs, had yet to begin its coll apse — finishing the book would have required a thor ough re-application of Counter-E conomics to a world a third of a century remove d from that of the original ma nuscript. The world has changed significantly since 1985 (with the provis o plus c’est la même chose): the collapse of the Soviet Union, due in no small part to Counter- Economics; the rise of Islamic terrorism; the return to a war-b ased (or, at least, war-accommodating) establishment economy; the scattershot legal ization (but not decriminalization) of marijuana; the privatization (however meager) of space travel; the explosion of both co mputer encryption power and hac kers’ ingenuity; the rise of digital currency à la Bitcoin; the ubiquity of surv eillance systems; the abandonment of any vestige of m outhed support for Liberty by th e elites of US"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 political parties, corporate boards, and governments worldwide. All these events have only served to increase, not decrease, the size and scope of the Counter- Economy. In re-reading the chapters for this edition, I found echoes of the past reverberating in the present — it turns out that even though th e references are dated, the principals underpinni ng CounterEconomics are consist ent and timely, and you will see how they apply to current events and how they can resolve today’s controversies and guide tomorrow’s choices in your own life and society at large. Scanning the manuscript in was an immensely frustrating effort (in the mid- 1990s, using OmniPage with a primitive scanner). Sam’s aging IB M Executive proportional-space typewriter had a floating “t” key that cause d an OCR spelling error in almost every word cont aining that letter, as well as a spacing error in nearly every word with an “o”. I spent hours and hours (as I co uld manage) over the ensuing years correcting e rrors and making Sam’s endnotes c onsistent with APA 6th Ed. standards. Because the book proposal had alr eady made the rounds to severa l publishers and been rejected, Sam never felt it worthwhile to put any more eff ort into a rewrite. When Sam gave me the manuscript (probably 1993 or so), he doubt ed its marketability almost a decade afte r its writing, but I told him I might be able to do something with it and he gav e me his permission to do so. I knew, however, that I would no t be able to complete the book by my 1990s self without some academic underpinning . Over the ensuing 20 or so y ears, I completed four university degr ees, from an Associate of Arts, t hrough a BSIS and an MBA, to an IT PhD in Infor mation Assurance and Security. I also published the aforementioned SEK 3 books and republished a few o f my own through KoPubCo. All that while working full time at my web-app development job, 1996–2014.

"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 At the urging of fellow award- winning author J.

In one e-mail, dated 11/28/1999, Sa m wrote: Although my “unpublishable” book, C ounter-Economics, was only h alf-written before I gave up trying to find a New York publisher back in th e early 1980s (best reply was from one who said, “ This is an example of the m ost immoral writing of the Libertarian Movement...” yeah!), I have around 1 0 chapters I could retype and put on the web. In a post to the Left Libertarian List, dated 1/26/00, Sam wrot e: ...

Each chapter described a par ticular area of C-E with the effect building up chap ter by chapter until the reader realizes that it covers all Human Action. Victor Koman apparently scanned and OCRed the manuscript pages and at Christmas this year presented them to me as a present. If I kee p getting encouragement ... I'll put them on line.... The upshot of this is that I had totally forgotten about this e xchange with Sam.

The answer is all of the above. That may sound confusing, but t he main purpose of this writing is to extract unity from these topics usually unconnected in most minds today . I hope it will indeed amuse and excite the reader about another, accessible wa y of life, give new explanation to some of the vexing problems that beset our s ocial life, and perhaps solve a few. Along the wa y, a few more burdens may be l ifted off the back of many of the oppressed — especially those who have chose n to fight back. Above all, may some of you be moved to act — on your own behalf. That is where it begins — with the self. If the individual has rights and chooses to exercise them in the teeth of organized, institutionalized o pposition, Counter- Economics begins. One need not be an anarchist or even much of a libertarian to counter-economize — and most to date have not been. Yet if a so cialist or fascist or even one devoid of ideology or thought learns and applies co unter-economic acts, the purest libertarianism has been, to my mind, advanced. To that end, I have deliberately left the philosophical implica tions of Counter- Economics to the end of the book . And to make sure you’ve found wading through the subject exciting enough to take a plunge into deepe r theory, I’ve put the economics next to the end. This is not meant to lure the resistant or to trap the unwary. This book is neither treatise nor manifesto; the author has those available elsewher e. Counter- Economics is meant to make Counter-Econom ics as accessible to as many as possible. Up front, then, with the deep stuff in the back, here’s what Co unter-Economics is. Economics is the study and pr actice of human action involvi ng voluntary exchange. Establishment “economi cs” is the presentation of expl anations of human action in such a way as to benefit the establishment or r uling segment of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 society. The former is an attempt at science; the latter is con artistry. Counter- Establishment Economics is the study and practice of that part of human action committed in spite of the official legitimacy (government legis lation) to the contrary. As counter-establishment culture proved unwieldy in the 1960s and was shortened to counterculture — though not without subse quent misrepresentation of its aims — counter-establishment economics will be shortened to counter- economics. To avoid misrepresentation, what I refer to as Count er-Economics will be capitalized consistently and defined in this way: Counter-Economics is the theory and practice of all human action neither accepted by the State nor involving any initiatory violence or threat of violence. If this formulation appears a bit arcane, it is required expli citly to exclude murder and theft from Counter-Ec onomics. Governments have a nea r-monopoly on murder (war) and theft (taxation and inflation) and we can l eave the few freelance statists out to give us a sharp, clean distinction. Given, then, the libertarian m oral code of not harming your fel low-sentient, Counter-Economics is doing what y ou want, when you want, for yo ur own good reasons. And, with that, we push the theory to the back and get ready to survey the field. The focus of the book is to show the reader what Counter-Econom ics is. We’ll look at it in every aspect of life in all parts of the globe an d beyond. Black market; grey market; dissidence both foreign and domestic; tax resistance; economic feminism; underground schools and shopping centers; go ld, silver, barter, and illegal aliens; crea tive computing and secure infor mation systems; gun-running and Bible-smuggling; life extension and intelligenc e increase; self- fulfillment and psychiatric resist ance; sensational exploits an d cold, hard, historical revisionism; alteration of inner space and outer spa ce — it’s all here.

Tax Counter-Economics “A vast underground economy rivaling the entire output of Canad a in size, involving as many as 20 million people and generating hundreds of billions of dollars in untaxed income, is thriving beneath America’s econom ic mainstream. “All told, more than half a trillion dollars a year — about one quarter of recorded output in the U.S. — is involved , according to some estimates.

The Los Angeles Times, for example, during the years that the author kept close watch, ran the following s tories: • July 17, 1979 — “100 Billion ‘Underground Economy’ Revealed” (Section IV, Pages 1 & 11). “‘Anybody who has looked at the subterranean economy will tell you it’s very large,’ Allen Voss of the General Accounting Office told the Ho use Ways & Means oversight subcommittee. “Officials describe the under ground economy as consisting of pe rsons who report less than they earn, including th ose who engage in bartering or work for cash only, and those who don’t even bother to file a return.” • September 18, 1979 — “‘Undergr ound Economy’ Comes Up for Air” (Part II, Page 5). Columnist Robert J. Sam uelson complains, “Government a gencies have a way of conferring respectability on ideas, and that’s just wh at the Internal Revenue Service has done for the ‘ underground economy.’ Until r ecently, this was just another random subject for newspaper and magazine stor ies.

Suddenly we have a full-scale social problem.” • January 9, 1980 — “Money, a Ques tion of Give and Take,” subti tled “Tax Man Cheated Out of Billions” (Part IV, Page 5), leads off with “‘I feel wonderful about not paying taxes,’ says R. M. Jones. ‘I don’t like to sup port a paper-tiger government and I don’t like taking care of people on welfare.’” • April 2, 1980 — “Evasions of Billions of Dollars In Income Ta x Feared,” subtitled “U.S. Concerned Over Unr eported Funds Flowing Into Ov erseas Bank Accounts” expands the concept inte rnationally. “The abuse of so -called “offshore’ accounts by wealthy Americans bent on tax evasion — as well as by narcotics traffickers, corporat e bribe-payers, and others — has reached unprecedented proportions, accord ing to many experts.” • April 7, 1980 — “On the Side o f the Lawless,” subtitled “Amer icans’ Tolerance of Underground-Economy Tax Cheats Costs Them Billions,” is an e ditorial attack by Times editorial writer Ernest Conine. Says he, “Most Americans are inclined to wink at such goings on. That isn’t very smart, to s ay the least. The fellow who cheats on his income t axes, whether he’s a carpet-la yer or a multimillionaire businessman, is stealing from honest taxpayers just as surely as if he stuck a gun in their ribs.” • April 17, 1980 — “More and More Refusing to Pay Taxes,” subti tled “Resisters and ‘Patriots’ Insist U.S. Has No Right to Levies” does not men tion the “Underground Economy” anywhere ( Part 1-C, Pages 7-8). Yet it be gins, “A growing number of Americans are refusing to file income tax for ms or to pay Uncle Sam another penny. Most of us spend several months a year working for the federal government, but the tax resisters have told the gov ernment, ‘I quit.’” More on this anomaly later. • April 18, 1980 — “Biggest Tax Swindle of Them All” headed a l etter column in the Times responding to Conine. Six missives were printed, a ll critical of Conine’s defense of taxation, though two supported taxation by offering an alternative, the Value-Added Tax or VAT.

Nor is this confined to the L.A. Times or U.S. News. Jack Ander son’s column of December 29, 1979, begins, “Hon est American taxpayers are being ripped off by an ever-growing economic ‘underground’ of tax chiselers whose u npaid taxes must be made up by the law-abiding population. Estimates vary o n the size of these tax guerrillas’ annual depred ations, but some experts bel ieve that their illicit tax-free transactions make up as much as one-third of t he total American economy. Perhaps the most alarmi ng feature of this shadowy army of cheaters is that many of its recruits are not hardened underworld figures, but respected and seemingly respectable citizens.” Columnist Sylvia Porter, “Your Money’s Worth,” devoted three co lumns (November 10–12, 1980) to the “ ‘Invisible’ Underground Economy. ” She concludes apocalyptically, “Comp liance must be the answer if we are to avoid the danger that our whole system will fall apart.” Perhaps her vision is not unwarranted. Zodiac News Service, Aug ust 1, 1980, sent out the following story: (ZNS) The Internal Revenue Servi ce recently decided to run a ch eck on its own employees by auditing the persona l income tax returns of 168 of its own auditors, who were selected at random.

The IRS was going to expand its a udit of its own auditors, but has since canceled that plan after the auditors lab eled the scheme “outrageous,” a nd “very, very unfair.” And the “threat” is not limited even yet. Thomas Brom, for Paci fic News Service, November 28, 1980, in the article “America’s Booming ‘Outlaw’ E conomy — Jobs for Many, Protection For None,” begins with this dire warn ing as an “Editor’s Note”: “The ‘outlaw’ or ‘underground’ economy, where cash pays the bill and the IRS is shunned, is growing by leaps and bounds, ac cording to recent estimates. It has come to function as a kind of shadowy catch-a ll survival system and unofficial welfare program for the growing legions of unemp loyed. But while it offers survival for many, it provides little welfare a nd no worker protection, and it represents a serious threat to American unio ns, reports Thomas Brom, PNS economics editor.” Finally, nothing is a popular phe nomenon if it’s not reported i n People magazine. So September 1979, page 30, a full-page photo of the General Ac counting Office’s Richard Fogel, captioned “If the government doesn’t ta ke action, the integrity of our whole tax syst em could be threatened,” is head lined “A New U.S. Study on Tax Evasion Is Another R eason To Shout: I’m Mad As Hel l And I’m Not Going To Take It Anymore.” Something is going on here. What it does not seem to be is the “tax rebellion” of the amateur constitutional lawy ers. What it does seem to be is highly successful and most irritating to the State, its Establishment, and their defenders. What The “Underground Economy” Is "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 “Underground Economy” conjures up a vision of some subsociety i nternal to the general society at large, with c onsciousness, structured organi zation, and a subculture of customs, traditi ons, and perhaps even art and lit erature. The picture of the underground shopping center in J. Neil Schulman’s Alongs ide Night (Crown, 1979) would fit. But that’s set in 2001 — speculative f iction — and no one claims such a subsociety exi sts today. Furthermore, Schulma n’s talking about the Counter-Economy, somet hing containing a lot more than tax evasion. So what is the current “Underg round Economy” and what is its re lation to the Counter-Economy, if any? The U.S. News & World Report gives the broadest definition of t he above sources and the most examples: “In brief, the underground econo my involves all the economic activity carried on every day that, for a variety of reasons, escapes tabulation by the nation’s official economic pulse takers — fro m moonlighting and roadside fruit-stands sales to high-level corporate chicane ry and multimillion-dollar skimming operations at gambling casinos.” S o far, it is broad enough to encompass the Counter-E conomy. But then, U.S. News na rrows it: “This ‘work force’ is dominated by the self-employed — from law yers, doctors, and accountants to shopkeepers and tradesmen — and by the worki ng poor. But it includes many from other slices of society, too — those who, among other things , pad tax deductions or underrepor t interest, dividend, rental, or royalty income.” Counter-Economics includes everyone. (See later chapters for a proof.) That is, a countereconomic activity is any human action that takes place w ithout the approval of the State. And since laws cover almost every human endeavour, often prohibiting both the action a nd its corresponding inaction, eve ryone to at least some small degree must bend or b reak laws simply to exist. U.S. News sees considerably few er people in its “Underground Ec onomy.” “In ways small and large, 15 to 20 million Americans probably are i nvolved, says Allen R. Voss, who supervised a s tudy of the problem by the Gen eral Accounting Office. Of these, as many as 4. 5 million derive all their suppo rt from subterranean income, according to Peter M. Gutmann, an economic s professor at City University of New York.” I n short, the “Underground Econom y” is the most hard-core committed sector of th e tax-law breakers of the Count er-Economy."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 Who are the taxless? Several examples, from housecleaning widow s to housewife tailors to roadside ve getable-vending farmers are giv en. This one may be archetypical: “A struggling 2 4year-old actress in New York C ity holds down three jobs to make ends meet: Sh e works as a bartender, a job t hat pays her $30 to $35 a day, including tips; helps out at her father’s jewelry shop on Saturdays, and appears occasionally in her ow n cabaret act at a Greenwich Village night spot. “All her jobs are off the books. Her employers, in other words, don’t withhold any taxes from her pay and don’t contribute toward Social Secur ity or unemployment insurance as they are required to do. ‘I’m complet ely underground,’ she says. ‘There are no records of anything I’m d oing.’” She exhibits no guilt or repen tance over her failure to account to the State for her action. One wistful note is str uck by the housecleaner. “‘As I get older,’ she says, ‘I’m starting to think, maybe I s hould have had my people pay o n Social Security for me. But this way I pay no taxes, no nothing.’” While the “Underground Economy” concept is heavily weighted tow ard tax evasion, the interconnectedness with other counter-economic act ivities such as Social Security evasion, labor r egulations avoidance, health an d safety inspection noncompliance, and illegal i mmigration is obvious The “Underground Economy” as defi ned by the IRS, et al., at mos t includes our actress and her employers. But remember, anyone who deals with her and is aware of her illegal activities is an accessory and co-conspira tor. Thus, all her friends, relatives, co-workers a nd probably many of her custome rs, fellow thespians, and even barflies are involved in the Counter-Econom y. This “ripple” effect is characteristic of Counter-Economics; one need not bel abor its effect on the majesty and authority of the State, its agents, and bureauc rats, on those even peripherally involved. ' Every non-statist job or enterprise is capable of some degree o f counter- economizing. Some industries seem to have a higher affinity for Counter- Economics than others. U.S. News delves into those commercial s ectors which,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 to maintain the metaphor, have a tendency to “submerge.” Leadin g the way is that heterogeneous set of empl oyment opportunities known as moo nlighting. “A whole panoply of moonlighters toils away in the underground economy. One such man, a young New York musician earned $7,500 — almost all of it in cash — by giving guitar lessons last year. But he declared none of i t on the joint return he filed with his wife. He didn’t list the income, he says, par tly out of need and partly out of anger. His parents paid high taxes for years, he says, yet he was denied government loans and gran ts available to others to help with his college expenses because his parents’ i ncome was too high.” The connect ion between anti-state resentment and counter-economic motivation is indica tive of the implicit libertarianism of Counter-Economics; the fact that it remains unfocused — currently — might well inter est libertarian strategists. “A moonlighter in Indiana works in a machine-tool shop during t he week and oversees a private trash-disposal facility on weekends, where h e takes in about $100 in unreported income each w eek.” While hard-core counter-e conomists are more common than expected (e.g . the actress and musician above) , most people are partially counter-economic. “Millions who work at regular jobs but are not subject to withh olding taxes — teachers, taxi drivers, door-to-door salespeople, pollsters, in surance agents, and real-estate brokers, among them — are accused by officials of b eing a major element in the underground economy. Some 47 percent do not repo rt their earnings, the IRS claims.” Interestingly, U.S. News fails to me ntion waitresses and waiters anywhere in their ar ticle; a surprising omission co nsidering the size of that Amazon Army (largely fema le) with largely unreported ti ps. How The Counter-Economic Taxless Do It How does it work? Fundamentally, as the Internal Revenue Servic e admits in its ironic way, the income tax is based on voluntary compliance. Wh ere the compliance occurs, it obscures ove r, is in the information abou t, not the collection of, its plunder. To put it simply and bluntly, you h ave to turn yourself in (or have someone you trust do it for you) to get taxed. Brea king down the State’s access to information a bout its victims is a general pr inciple of counter-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 economic mechanics; the other m ethod involves letting them know when they are impotent to act — which does work in certain fields but is hard ly “underground.” This then is the real meaning of “underground” in this context — out of “sight” of the eyes of the State’s infor mants and enforcers. How does t his work in day- to-day practice? Nearly all the examples given use cash — and complicity. Cash is untraceable; in effect, even if the State sus pects, as long as they have the present legal system they cannot prove or convict. They need records — and testimony . The complicity is, of course, bought outright with a discount. (In a few rare cases, especially with artists, artisans, and special drug smugglers, complicity may be purchased by the uniqueness of the product; i.e., you can’t get it except by underground agreement.) Another method, however, operates by the obverse method — no ca sh. Says U.S. News, “Barter transactions are thought to be another sizable so urce of untaxed income. A Flint, Michigan, attorn ey was given a $300 antique cr edenza by a local resident he represented in a child-support matter. The at torney often swaps services with his clients but does not report as income the val ue of the items he receives. ‘I don’t feel guilty about what I do,’ he says. ‘The government is ripping me off.’” Again we see the anti-state resentment justif ying illegality — and the ripple effect in this one lawyer’s “contamination” of a whole town full of clients with countereconomic complicity. “Another man, a self-employed co mmercial illustrator and copywr iter in Chicago who is fed up with high taxes , says he does little cash busines s but a lot of bartering. He writes advertising copy for a liquor store in exc hange for alcoholic beverages he needs for entertaining, and does illustrations for an ad agency in return for typographical services. He figures that the barterin g accounts for 5 to 10 percent of his business.” Unde rground enterprise — like the overground type — seems limited only by ingenu ity. Of course, the “overground e conomy” is also limited by the State’s control and regulations. Oh, yes, how does this artist feel about his outlaw activities? “‘These trades happen so frequently, on a low economic level, that I can’t kee p track of how"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 often I do it,’ he says. Hiding it from the tax collector would have bothered him a couple of years ago. No longer. ‘Now I think of it in terms of economic survival. Taxation has become legalized theft.’” He sounds like an ideolo gical libertarian. Besides these two methods of keep ing income “off the books” to keep it from the tax men, another method is to manipulate the books themselves. One group of retirees collect winnings at race tracks for big-time bettors, then turn them over to their backers who avoid high-bracket income levels. Expense acc ounts can and do absorb all sorts of transactions to be kept off the personal income books. “Skimming” is nearly universal in small storefront businesses, shops, and taxis: keeping a portion of each day’s take without recording it. A je weler interviewed by U.S. News does $10 million worth of business a year, 25 to 3 0 percent of it in cold cash. “He says he thinks 10 to 20 percent of all the incom e generated ‘on the street’ goes unreported.” Massi ve. And he sounds like Ayn Rand: “I started with nothing and built up a business of millions. The government sta rted with billions, and they keep going in debt. They just waste the money.” And finally, one can simply double the books, one for you and o ne for the State: “A Houston barber keeps two sets of books, one for herself, one for the IRS. Most business is in cash; she poc kets about a third of it, or $ 200 a week, without reporting it.” One last U.S. News example puts it all together. “A California merchant who boasts that he hasn’t paid 1 per cent of income tax in five year s offers this how-to- do-it advice on skimming: ‘The most important thing is consiste ncy. If you skim, skim the same amount each year. If you let one year go by witho ut taking anything off and then take 20 percent the next, you’re going to get caught. “‘Even an IRS audit doesn’t mean the end of the world. You are usually notified in advance. All you have to do is b uy some new receipt books an d make them fit your figures. As long as the receipts are numbered consecutivel y, and the figures jibe, you’re O.K. In fact, the year I cheated the government wa s the year I was audited. The upshot was the inspector ended up congratulating m e on what fine shape my records were in. Chea ting the government is so easy it ’s pitiful.’” "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 What Causes The “Underground Economy?” The Counter-Economy exists because the State exists. Every inte rvention by the State in the free market dislocates supply from demand. Besides being the coercive curse that libertarians denounce, each intervention cr eates an economic opportunity for an entrepreneur t o figure out how to supply dem and that the State prohibits or cheaper than the State allows. In the special case of the taxless “Underground Economy,” every tax is a challenge. Let’s take a look at New York City. Says U.S. News: “New York City’s black market in bootleg ci garettes, which by some estima tes accounts for up to half of all sales of the t obacco product in the city now, could be denying the city and the State ‘hundreds of millions of dollars a year’ in revenue, says David Durk, assistant commissioner of en forcement for the city’s Depa rtment of Finance. The reason for the burge oning bootleg market: The high excise tax, which totals 23 cents a pack.” Unique? Read on. “New York City’s relatively high sales tax of 8 percent poses another problem. It is common fo r merchants to skim 20 percent of it, says economist Gutmann.” And only in N ew York? “A sales-tax expert, John F. Due, an economics professor at the University of Illinois, says that from 3 to 5 percent of total sales taxes due nationwide, or as much as 2 billion a year, escapes collection.” A second U.S. News article, directly following, “Cheating on Ta xes — A Worldwide Pursuit,” documents s imilar figures and adjusted for local cultural practices, around the world. Schwarzarbeit in Germany, travail noir in France, “fiddlers” in Britain, and moroc ho in Argentina are terms coine d to deal with black labor and black money. “It aly’s underground economy is gr owing so rapidly that the government now includes it in economic plannin g.” Argentine government officials “estimate that up to 40 percent of all bus iness is involved.” Japan, Sweden, and Canada are cove red, and “Economists in Thail and throw up their hands when asked to estimat e what uncollected taxes are c osting the government. ‘Who knows?’ is the response given most often.” We’ ll look at the International Counter-Econom y in detail next chapter. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 Should There Be An “Underground Economy?”: Critics and Defender s There is a Counter-Economy, in particular the sector involved w ith tax evasion, and it’s vast. It was “discovere d” and named by this author, sp eaking to radical libertarians, in 1974. Now the “underground” part, at least, ha s been discovered by others and they do not approve. While leaving the theory and justification to the end as promised, I think I m ay whet the reader’s appetite b y previewing the debate between libertarians and the Establishment writers on ju st the tax question. Both camps agree that a perfect society would not have a Counte r-Economy, or any part thereof. What they disagree on is that the libertarian s see the Counter- Economy as that perfect society in embryo struggling to hatch; the opposition sees it as a blight and unsightly tumor on the more-or-less acc eptable body politic. Welfare state defenders and pla nners don’t like it. Says U.S. N ews: “governmental programs are upset by the underground economy. Be cause of unregulated jobs and income, the r eadings of government statist icians — whose numbers can trigger automatic cos t-of-living raises or pump bil lions of dollars of fiscal adrenalin into the economy when unemployment goes up — m ay be out of phase with what really is happeni ng. Unemployment, for example, actually may be almost a half percentage point lower than the official figur es indicate, says an economist who has studied it, and the number of poverty-stricke n somewhat fewer.” Libertarians would point out that perhaps the Counter-E conomy could absorb all the unemployed, especially when the State breaks down in runaway inflation or catastrophic depression — w hich result from the State’s own controls. Ernest Conine of the L.A. Times puts it this way: “In a perfect world, all inequalities would disappear. Pendi ng that unlikely day, howeve r, the complaints that all of us have about governme nt hardly add up to a valid e xcuse for cheating on taxes.” Perhaps not, but what does Conine think is wrong wit h it? “After all, when a house painter or a lawyer reports only half his income, he isn’t hurting David Rockefeller, the Pentagon , Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Supreme Court or the big-time tax evader.” Why some or all of them should be hurt wo uld be very"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 enlightening, if explained by an editor of the Los Angeles Time s. Alas, no: such analysis is given. And, on top of that, Conine is factually wro ng, 180° out of whack. Since all those except the “big-time tax evader” live of f the State’s taxes, there’s that much less a pie fo r them to divide. If all the eco nomy went “underground,” all the aforementioned would be bankrupt. Who is the counter-economist hur ting, according to Conine? “He is hurting the guy down the street who works for a straight paycheck and has n o way of avoiding taxes, even if he want ed to, and thus must pay both hi s share of the tax burden and that of the tax cheat as well.” Again Conine is wron g; if his economic theory holds, then if everyone avoided taxes but one unlucky st iff, he or she would support the entire tax bur den. There is some “elasticity” to tax “supply” but nothing on the order of 20–30% of the economy. The State is simply collecting fewer taxes — period. Conine blames “tax cheating” for higher taxes and concludes, “S omehow, though, this is a case where too many people instinctively side not with the cops but with the robbers... Most of us seem determined to go right on looking on small-bore tax cheats with bemu sed tolerance — even playing the ir game with off-the-books cash payments for services rendered — in blithe d isregard of the fact that they are placing their fair share of the tax burden o n our shoulders.” ' Further in the book, the “guy with the straight paycheck” will find more ways, if he hasn’t picked up several already, on how he can join the tax less. One chapter will deal with Brown of Pacific News Service’s fear of illegal alien exploitation and lack of security, the large literature already extant on fr ee-market economics answers Sylvia Porter’s fears of the collapse of society, and t he collapse of the State in society, that is, how the Counter-Economy can expand t o overwhelm the State’s economy and create a fr ee society, and sell it to an op pressed, angry people already fighting back to the limits of their understandi ng, will be dealt with in the final chapter of the book. What a fair share of the tax burden, if any, is takes us into t he theory, which is being put off.

International Counter-Economics Having established the existence of at least the taxless part o f the Counter- Economy and at least in this contin ent, one has two directions to expand the concept — other fields in this continent and Counter-Economics abroad. There is also the combination of the two — the countereconomy across the borders of this continent and those of others. In a free market, there are no borders. There are geography, s pace to be crossed with goods and information, and obstacles to be overcome all af fecting the price. When the State imposes imaginar y boundaries and real enforcers such as customs inspectors, immigration officers, and treasury agents — not to mention armies and navies — the market splits. T he white market sees obstacles ; the black market sees opportunities. To c ounter-economists, a border is j ust another obstacle to moving goods and services to be dealt with efficien tly and competitively. Some of the goods smuggled incl ude people, money, and things — the last known as contraband and can be anything from jeans to cocaine. Another field of border-avoiding commerce is trans porting information. That can range from “pirate broadcasting” to industrial and political espionage. Th ere is even a tactic of moving legally acceptable goods across borders to take advan tage of different tax breaks and export incentives. This may be the best time to point out that there are places wi th virtually no counter-economy (though counter-economists from other areas may be operating here only): space, the high seas , and the free ports. The rapid militarization and nationalization of the first two is generating Counter-Economic s and will be covered later. The third category describes areas where the Sta tes of the world have contracts (treaty) to refrain from control — though that i s revocable at any time, as Danzig and Tangiers f ound out. Even Hong Kong and Sing apore were briefly occupied during World War II. One can draw what lessons one wishes from these places which have no economic intervention and no co unter- economy, and standards of living far higher than their surround ings. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 Almost every major country, by th e way, has free-trade zones at airports and seaports to allow transfer of goods from international carrier to international carrier. New York City has one on Staten Island. Prominent pedo philiac Roman Polanski, subject to arrest on sight in the United States, land ed at Los Angeles International and took off agai n en route from France to Tahiti . He was not molested, though he wisely remained in the plane throughout. Su ch areas of free trade are hardly the result of S tate benevolence or laxity; sho uld a State eliminate such boons to trade, another State in the “international anarch y” will offer the service and increase the share of business. What about the “underground economy” of tax evasion? Does that exist abroad? In many places, taxation is worse than in the United States, so expecting the more Counter-Economics the more the intervention, we should find ple nty. The International “Underground Economy” The term Schwarzarbeit in West Germany and travail noir in Fran ce both mean “black labor.” “Whatever this hidden market is called, in Europ e it means that workers evade income tax, socia l security, and often other taxe s by failing to report their full earnings to the government. Employers dodge s ocial-welfare taxes, and, in some countries, val ue-added levies. They also av oid paying higher wages to regular employees for overtime.” How many are involved ? “Experts at the International Labor Office in Geneva estimate that in Europ e 5 percent or more of the total labor force ma y be involved in the hidden eco nomies. That means 7 to 8 million workers!” 1 Outside of the Warsaw Pact, the m ost socialist — statist — coun try is usually considered to be Sweden. “Sweden , the most heavily taxed nation in Europe, has a hidden economy that is estimated to total at least 10 percent of the national output — and to cost the government taxes amounting to 15 perce nt of the budget.” Labor barter seems to be the main method, and the Swed ish State is trying mightily to suppress count er-economic labor “and tighten its tax controls, already among the toughest in Europe. But authorities seem to b e fighting a losing battle...” 2 "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 “Italy’s underground economy is growing so rapidly that the gov ernment now includes it in economic planning. Official estimates put income from hidden labor at around 10 percent of the gross national product — or a bout 24 billion dollars — in 1978. But a recent study said it is much greater, as high as 43 billion dollars in 1979.” Counter-economic labor marketing benefits both employer and emp loyee, cutting across class lines even in class- obsessed Europe. Why? The blac k laborers of Italy “usually receive lower wages, put in longer hours and hav e no social- security or other fringe benef its. But they pay no taxes.” 3 Those who wish to argue that labor wants to avoid risk and trusts the government to protect it from exploiting entrepreneurs, will ha ve to deal with this inconveni ent existence: “More than six million workers, one-third of Italy’s labor forc e. are secretly employed.” And for the Italian employers, Counter-Economics “lo wers their labor costs, gives them a flexibl e work force and enables them to require employees to work overtime when needed.” 4 Has only Italian labor acquire d counter-economic consciousness? “The owner of a clothing factory — staffed with illegal workers — may sell hi s product to a middleman. The middleman, operati ng from a delivery van, sells to a retailer. The retailer does not register the purchase and thus can sell a t a discount because he has not paid the value-added tax.” 5 Note how layers of economic activity form between the initial producer and the final consumer and these l ayers form counter-economic steps i n the “capital pyramid.” 6 No step of production seems safe — for the statist. “Yet, why is it that you seldom hear a peep about deregulation under the blue skies of the sunny Mediterranean ? ...

Of course there is little talk about deregulation in Italy . Why fight the paper tiger? Th e marvelous Mediterranean spirit, the Italia n genius, the wise, vital flow of brio, has solved the problem without it. The Italians have cut the Gordian knot. “They can have all the rules and regulations in the world; they will simply not observe them. The Italians have raised civil disobedience to a fine, subtle art. They have made regulations what most of them deserve to be — th e dead letters of someone else’s desire.” 7 France has less tax oppression and the travail noir is estimate d at — only — 800,000 workers and five billion dollars, though that is undoub tedly an underestimate. “Most hidden work is in plumbing, painting, roof ing, electrical installation, and other home repa irs. But dressmaking, auto and truck repairs, hairdressing, and carpentry are a lso popular.” So far no one ha d checked out data processing there. The ranks of the government itself are not immune. “Even such c ivil servants as policemen moonlight at night or on weekends.” More on that in a bit, How about welfare cases? “Some persons who draw high unemployment benefit s prefer full- time underground jobs to working legally.” 8 Union statism adds incentive to West German Counter-Economics. where lower taxes might otherwise depress mo tivation. (Artificially high wa ge rates create a barrier to entry leaving jobs undo ne.) Schwarzarbeiters combat the artificially high wage rates. “Plumbers and br icklayers, who charge $17 to $ 25 an hour if employed openly through a contr actor, can be hired secretly for half that price.” 9 It’s impossible to assign market value without recording transa ctions, but German officials estimate twen ty-five billion dollars of untaxe d work a year costing their State four billi on in taxes — which assumes it wo uld even have been performed if taxed. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 Insidiously and erroneously, “a state labor ministry says 230,0 00 West Germans could find work if Schwarzarbe it were eliminated.” The millions of black workers who would be unemployed are of no consequence to the la bor ministry. 10 Fines of $380,000 were imposed with one worker in Stuttgart fin ed $5,000 and taxed $112,000 for earning $250,000 in seven years. “But fines do not seem to help.” 11 “In Great Britain these underground workers are called ‘fiddler s.’ It is estimated that one of every eight Britons earns a minimum of $2,200 a yea r by moonlighting and does not pay a penny of tax on the unofficial income. By one reckoning, the black economy accounts for close to 8% of Britai n’s gross national product.” 12 Those who fear for the stifling of British incentive under social democracy may take heart. The British are counter-econom izing with the same techniques as the American a nd European, but there are a f ew unique cases. “One fiddle that is hard to bring under control is taking plac e on the oil rigs in the North Sea. Many British companies and subsidiaries of forei gn firms cooperate with the government ’s payas-you earn plan and deduct taxes from employees’ pay, But some drillers refuse to do so... up to now, about 8,000 workers have paid no taxes on earnings of about 90 million doll ars.” 13 Earlier, cross-border Counter-E conomics for purposes of tax eva sion was mentioned. Some spectacular cases of Swedish movie stars and En glish rock stars are well known. Here’s the testimony of a lumpenbourgeois ie: “If I worked at home, I might make as much as $400 a week, out of which I’d have to pay rent, buy food — and pay taxes, But, doing the same work in Ger many or Holland, I get $700 a week plus meals and a place to live. I ta ke my money in cash and don’t pay taxes to anybody.” 14 On to the Third World: Argentin a calls it black money — morocho — that is tax free, and estimates 40% of all business is involved. 15 “The head of a construction company sums up the situation th is way: ‘You won’t have a hamme r swinging anywhere in this country unless you are prepared to pay black m oney.”’ And in"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 the higher classes, “A banker in B uenos Aires reports: ‘The apa rtment next to ours was sold a few weeks ago for $360,000 — all in cash and al l black money.

To enter the more prestigious universities requires the payment of “backdoor” adm ission fees. “Parents have paid the yen equivalent of from $4,600 to $460,00 0 to school officials in order to get their children into their chosen univ ersity.” 17 Thailand, near the black-market haven of Burma, makes up for Ja pan’s law- abiding. “The taxpolicy division of the Finance Ministry estima tes that less than 10% of the country’s 19-millionmember labor force files tax ret urns.” 18 That’s 90% who do not file tax returns. S omebody must be watching thos e 10% like hawks. Just to make sure the i ncentive is to play and not fink, “an auto salesman offers a prospective customer a ‘friendship price’ of from 10 t o 30 percent off the list price if the buyer pays in cash and agrees to forget any p aper work that could be used by tax collectors to trace the sale.” 19 Returning to Italy for a bit, one finds a counter-economic effe ct even more threatening to the State. It seem s the majority of that six mil lion (1979 estimate 20 ) or two to four million (1977 estimate 2l ) are the government workers themselves! Working from 8 A.M. to 1:30 P.M., the Roman bureaucrats are wel l positioned for afternoon second jobs. 22 “‘Yes, I know I’m taking up a jo b someone else needs,’ says a bureaucrat in the Italian Finance Ministry who su pplements his $400 a month gover nment salary by working in a real estate office in the afternoons and by ski pping his government job in the mornings if a big deal comes up. ‘But I’v e got to look out for my wife and three children.’” 23 The rise of British CB and smuggling of various goods such as d rugs, guns, and people will be taken up in their appropriate chapters. Still, r emember that the business generated is tax-free: “The Coast Guard estimates that six to eight"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 billion dollars in illicit weed was successfully smuggled by sh ip into the U.S. last year.” 24 That’s just one product and one method of shipping. And yet, “y ou ain’t seen nothing yet.” Let us turn now to the Eastern bloc, the Warsaw P act and other nations laboring under Marxism, L eninism, and variants thereof. Counter-Economics Under Communism Argentina, ruled mostly by a m ilitary dictatorship, seems to ha ve a thriving counter-economy as we have seen. Is there a substantive differe nce between “authoritarian” regimes of right-wing statism and “totalitarian ” regimes of left- wing statism — at least in this regard? A drug haven like Colom bia or Bolivia, riddled with corruption, may have a booming counter-economy but what about Third World countries cleaned up and reformed by Marxist-Lenini st governments? Perhaps the most im portant question in this area i s, can the power of the State get so great that the counter-economy, rather than growing in response, gets crushed? Viet Nam could answer all these questions. After all, were ther e not dire predictions of catastrophe, nay, apocalypse, when the free-ente rprise Americans were driven out by the Communist North Vietnamese? Woul d anyone making the distinction between authoritarian and totalitarian s tates deny post-1973 Viet Nam i s the latter? Is not Viet Nam both “Third World” and “Second World?” Back in July of 1976, this author noticed a report on Viet Nam and wrote it up as follows; it is printed in its entirety. The “corruption” which so tainted the Thieu-Ky regime and the U . S. sergeants has infected the Lao Dong (Communist Party) cadre in “liberated ” Saigon, according to reporter Patrice de Beer in a two-part article in the weekly English edition of Le Monde, the famous French daily. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 “Not a dollar has dropped into Saigon’s empty coffers since Apr il 30, 1973, not a bag of American rice has come to alleviate the crop shortfalls, ” reports Beer. Elsewhere, he describes the scen e in the present Saigon. “Yet the city streets are crowde d with cars and motorized bikes . Swarms of prostitutes ply their trade in the old To Do street, and the th ieves’ market offers piles of stereo sets, fans, and other American goods brought ou t from heaven knows where. I was even held up for a quarter of an hour in a t raffic jam while trying to drive out of the city.” Beer goes on to describe the probl em of the new society “Some m embers of the new ruling class (a very tiny fraction, I was assured, but quit e conspicuous) are following in the footsteps of t heir predecessors, providing the prostitutes with a new clientele, especially in th e centrally situated Miramar Hot el, occupied by cadres. Waiters in the posh restaurants complain that the ‘bodo i’ (soldiers of the People’s Army) are not good cus tomers because they don’t have a ny money. ‘But the “canbos” (cadres) are good customers. They are rich an d give fat tips.’” Now Beer describes what a libertarian would call a full-blown c ounter-economy: “Exit visas are rumoured to be going for hundreds of dollars, g asoline intended for arms and government use finds its way into the black market , and civil servants or persons posing as civil servants are alleged to sol icit bribes from families for freeing a husband or b rother sent to a re-educatio n center. Some of the leaders live in requisitioned villas, and have cars, buy fu rniture, television sets, and let themselves be corrupted by the old bourgeoisie, w hich knows in the long run its fate is sealed, and is not therefore inclined to b e optimistic. Those who have decided to stay are sp ending everything they have. Thi s accounts for the rush on expensive restaurants and a frenzied buying spree, which is fueling an inflationary flare-up.” Students of Austrian economics will smile at Patrice de Beer’s reversal of cause and effect on his inflation analysis, and note the classic desc ription of a “flight into real goods.” "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 Beer goes on to report the vicious gossip about the “bodoi” and “canbos”, the investigation by the Lao Dong of corruptions, the hostility bet ween Northerners and Southerners. “As for the Northerners, they ar e dazed at the sight of the Sou th’s apparent prosperity, for they have been told their compatriots were shor t of everything. “The demobilisation has just begun and a number of ‘bodoi’ have been assigned jobs in the economy. They are s till being asked to make sacrifi ces to help their ‘brothers in the South,’ though in their eyes the South Vietnam ese don’t seem so badly off.” Being a Communist country, Viet Nam naturally has a Five-Year P lan. But it sounds strangely like something from Ford or Carter: “The south ’s so called policy of ‘five economic sectors’ — state, co-operative, mixed, capitalist, and private — should continue for s ome time more to come. As Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out, the state must ‘u se capitalism’s qualities and cur b its negative tendencies.’ ... He added it was necessary to be ‘flexible, ver y realistic, and be able at times to fall back a little.’ Principles couldn’t be be nt any further in a situation where officially the country is headed towards a soci alist type of economy. It ought to be mentioned that even in the North there is a lively private sector nicknamed the ‘under-the-counter sector.’” 25 That was 1976. Surely, that was too close to the end of the war with the United States. Things must have changed, say, four years later? “The economy is strictly black m arket. Privately run shops rema in open, but they are musty places full of cheap, imitation lacquer dishes and mi nd-numbing political treatises, all at outrageous prices. “There also are government shops w here civil servants and gover nment enterprise employees buy their monthly food rations. “A laborer is entitled to 13 kilograms of rice a month — just u nder one pound a day — and the scale goes downwar d to the office clerk, who is a llotted less than one-quarter pound a day. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 “There is rarely enough rice to go around. There also are limp vegetables and the occasional piece of pork or beef.” A miserable scene is observe d after seven years of communism, as predicted... except for one thing. “The black market is called C ho Troi or ‘sky market’ because go ods are displayed outdoors. Here, in the side streets and the central m arketplace with its satellites throughout the city, is the collective economy of Ho Chi Minh City. “Prices are fearsome, but the market is the only place such exo tic items as razor blades, soap that makes suds, fresh food, tape cassettes, and d ecent cloth are available. “Gasoline at more than $15 a ga llon may be the most expensive in the world. That tiny razor blade is $5 and the highly prized Lux brand Ame rican toilet soap $11. “In a place where official salar ies average less than $100 a mo nth, such luxuries as electricity and a telephone have become virtual objects of c uriosity. “The black market thrives on th e official ‘intershop,’ which is open to all foreigners and accepts major curre ncies of the world — but not the Vietnamese dong, worth 43 cents at the official rate.” 26 Perhaps seven years after the Re volution is not enough. How abo ut the People’s Republic of China, twenty-one year s after its Revolution? “In a dragnet of Shanghai, China’s largest metr opolis, the police have arrested nearly 200 black marketeers in recent weeks and confiscated valuables ranging fr om television sets and tape cassettes to marri age manuals and ‘pornographic m aterials,’ the Shanghai newspaper Wen Hui Bao reported.” 27 How does one conduct Counter-Economics in such incredibly crowd ed conditions? “Privacy is nonexist ent here; so even an illicit bu siness must be conducted in the open, but the b lack marketeers are more subtle than most. On bustling Zhongshan Road the other day, a huge crowd of youths s urrounded an older man who was playing a br and new Sanyo tape recorder. They listened"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 awhile, then disappeared into a side street cafe. One young man returned, the tape recorder tucked under his arm, I t had obviously changed hands i n the cafe. “Another favorite device is for people hawking sunglasses from abroad to keep the foreign sticker on one lens , attesting to the place of orig in. Foreign sunglasses, the latest status sym bol for China’s young, sell on the black market at tremendous markups, typically $25 fo r a pair that costs $5 in H ong Kong.” 28 The Chinese Counter-Economy is limited neither in scope nor in geography. “High-quality consumers goods, ava ilable here only in small qua ntities and in government control, account for most of the illicit trade, but there are exotic items, too. Black marketeers have been nabbed here for selling a Chinese- language sex manual, A Guide to a Happy Marriage. And heroin is smuggled into Guangdong province from Hong Kong. “Black market activities thrive i n this pace-setting city, wher e 11.6 million people seem a bit more prosperous and decidedly more stylish th an most Chinese, but the more staid places are not immune. “In a so-far unsuccessful drive to stop illegal trading in Beij ing, perhaps China’s most tightly controlled city, cap ital police have repeatedly ra ided the black market on Dongdon Street. Yet on many Sunday afternoons, young speculators still gather in the same spot, l ess than a mile from the Public Security Ministry, to swap goods.” 29 Nevertheless, all regions of Ch ina are not equal, counter- econ omically. (All regions of, say, the U.S., are not equal economically, either. ) The areas bordering on “capitalist” countri es seem, naturally enough, to have a better counter-economy, at least in te rms of availability of goods. “B ecause it lies next door to the British colony of Hong Kong, Guangdong province in South China appears to be the entry point f or black market goods. It also b oasts what Chinese sources believe to be China’s lar gest black market, in Fatshan, a 20-minute bus ride outside Guangzhou. "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 “Fatshan is so well-stacked with watches, radios, tape recorder s, calculators, television sets, and other luxuri es that it is a magnet for peo ple from all over China. “Even official purchasing agents from rural communes, under ord ers to buy scarce goods for collective use, t urn to Fatshan when supplies at the government stores are depleted.” 30 One would probably, at this point, expect the area close to the Republic of China on Taiwan to be riddled with marketeering. “Quanzhou, which lie s on the coast of Fujian province opposite the N ationalist-held island of Taiw an, is dotted with vendors selling Dunhill, Viceroy, a nd other Western cigarettes for 65 cents to $1.30 a pack. Squatting on the dusty roads, they display their wares openly, but fold up shop and hurry off when approached by cameras. “Other sidewalk stalls display tapes recorded by Teresa Teng, a Taiwan torch singer whose romantic ballads are hits throughout China though she has never set foot on the mainland. Like the other merchandise, the tapes wer e smuggled in from Hong Kong, one vendor acknowledged.” 31 Smuggling will be covered in a cha pter coming soon but there is one thing we ought to check on. After all, there is far more repression of i t by the anti-market Communists than the freedoml oving Nationalists, right? “Althoug h arrests have been made on both sides, the Na tionalists appear to be far more concerned than the Beijing government about stopping the trade. A special inve stigation force was organized last month in Tai pei to probe the smuggling rings , a government spokesman said, and further arrests are anticipated. Under Taiw an’s strict martial law trading with ‘the enemy,’ th e Communists, is a traitorous a ct punishable by long prison sentences.” 32 If there is any place which might have the free market utterly stamped out, it would have to be Cambodia, after Pol Pot and the additional dev astations of the war driving him out. “The black market stretches from Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, t o Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, in southe rn Vietnam. Its hub is this dir ty town of war-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 gutted houses and tin-roofed shack s swollen by transients from almost every province in the country. “Sisophon is about 30 miles from the frontier, where Thai merc hants have set up open air supermarkets to which the Cambodians flock despite occ asional robbers and fighting en route and guerrillas who take a cut of the trad e.” 33 Can nothing stop the Counter-Economy from its activity? Nope. “ It all starts with gold exchanged at the border for Thai currency, the baht. The C ambodian trafficker uses the baht to make his purchases, which are then resold here, usually for gold again. But this is only the small loop of a seemingly haphazard, but in fact highly effective, distribution system. “Armies of bicyclists, averaging 30 miles a day, set out from h ere along the country’s major roads, especially routes 5 and 6 to Phnom Penh, the capital. Bulging sacks and boxes are lashed to the bicycle seats, and bo lts of cloth sometimes dangle and flap behind as the dealer pushes the bike along. “Some travel between their homes and the border; others drop of f their goods at the ‘free markets’ which thrive in almost all the towns. Bike r epair shops and refreshment stands dot the roads ides for benefit of the traders who also move on foot, ox-carts, motorcycles, m ilitary and civilian trucks, and the train from Phnom Penh to Battambang, 25 miles east of the frontier.” 34 We all know of the lack of produc tion in Democra tic Kampuchea... or is it the government’s lack rather than the people of Cambodia? “The 14-m onth-old government has been able to give little else but rice from fore ign donors to the general population, and has difficulties distributing it. So mo st, including most government officials, must shop on the free market where medici nes, watches, clothes, cigarettes, and even Japanese-made radio-cassette play ers and motorcycles are available.” 35 No starvation in Phnom Penh, evacuated by Pol Pot and reduced t o basic, primitive communism? “At Phnom P enh’s bustling old market one c an, thanks to unbridled free enterprise, sit down to a good roast duck and ve getables, canned"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 Australian or Japanese beer, and in ternational-aid rice that ha s seeped into the system.” 36 Of course there was privation in Cambodia and many people died. But the Counter-Economy survived and burg eoned. And the Counter-Economy , let one never forget. is human action — that is, humans acting. Some in Cambodia retain their incentive and produce agai nst the worst threats a governm ent can issue and in the face of all the examples of the death threats carried ou t. They are those greedy, heartless, cowardly, profit-gouging, couldn’t-care-for- their-fellow-man speculative enterprisers — who , by all accounts, alone keep Cam bodia from total starvation imposed by the people-loving Communists of Pol Pot a nd his equally Communist opponent, Heng Samrin. Perhaps the final irony is that not only does right-wing Thaila nd’s market supply the Cambodian Counter-Economy, b ut also Samrin’s ally’s Counter -Economy — Viet Nam itself! “Although most of the trade is with Thailand, there is also a sizeable two-way commerce with V iet Nam. Consumer goods such as tea, soap, fruit, and bicycle parts make the ir way to Cambodia. But the Vi etnamese, sometimes coming by truck to deliv er aid or supplies for their forces, also haul back Thai goods which they purchase from the Cambodians with go ld.” 37 Counter-Economics In The Second World There’s one last possibility one must exclude before concluding that the Counter- Economy cannot be suppressed but rather will thrive under even greater statism. Perhaps all Asiatic or South Amer ican (Cuban) Communist states are too new, too Oriental (by which is usually meant prone to corruption) or Latin, or just too weak to stand up to the mighty wealth of world capitalism. If a nywhere answers these objections, it is the nations of the Warsaw Pact — the Ea stern bloc, where the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics holds far more sway in the name of Marx and Lenin than does capitalist NATO and its running-dog lackeys . Poland is considered anomalous b ecause of the rise of Solidarit y, so it will be accepted as a poor example for our proof. Solidarity’s rise, ho wever, must then be credited to the counter-econom ic case since it organized and struck in defiance"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 of all Polish laws. In fact, most unions even in the United Sta tes began counter- economically. (What they turned into and why is left for later. ) In 1976, Poland experienced a m ass upheaval which subsided unti l Solidarity’s rise. “The prime minister of Poland ordered price increases of staples, food, clothes, etc., in the state-owne d stores. Immediately, demonstr ations of consumers hit the streets, similar to those which toppled First Secretary Gomulka and brought in present dictator Edward Gierek. Within 24 hours, Gierek’s prime minister suspended his own orders. “One factor not mentioned in mos t press coverage was that these same goods were available to some extent in a number of private stores all owed and in the widespread black market. The Gua rdian noted that the counter-ec onomic price was higher than the state price even after the official price i ncrease, yet business is brisk.” 38 So how free is the stable Eastern bloc from Counter-Economics? “Romanians, unlike Poles, are not officially allowed to possess foreign cur rency, but this does not stop the inevitable money ch angers from accosting foreigner s on the streets. The black market rate has rocketed since the Polish crisis bega n and is now five times the official rate, or more , the most coveted currency in Romania is a packet of foreign cigarettes (preferably Kents). In a practice that co nstitutes the thin edge of the wedge of bribery and corruption — an integral part of East European life — a packet of cigarettes is slipped to the head waiter, an d food and drink, which were off the menu five mi nutes before, miraculously reapp ear. A foreign businessman, who lives in Romania but drives a foreign-register ed car, is stopped by the police. A packet of cigare ttes, and documents that were suspect a moment before are suddenly in order. Tho se packets of cigarettes chang e hands again for under-the-counter food supplies fo r quality clothing, for house repairs. And they oil the wheels of bureaucracy.” 39 Actually, much of the Counter-E conomy of the East works like th at of Western Europe described earlier: “The system involves second and third jobs, many performed for Western currency, w hich in turn may be used to bu y luxuries. In Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslova kia, the second economy has gro wn so"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 dominant that many workers have c ome to devote more of their ti me and energy to that sector than to their regular jobs. “Construction workers in Czechosl ovakia and Hungary are rarely found on their regular jobs past the noontime lunch break. They are off on the ir second or third jobs.” 40 Want to buy a car in Hungary but the State says no? “A housekee per in Budapest hotel told how, despite recent police crackdowns, she was still able to order a new-model Soviet-built Lada aut omobile from a local underground supplier, delivery in one month, for a price 50 percent higher than the o fficial price, cash in full on delivery. “Her supplier, to whom she cautiously introduced a Western corr espondent, said that the system operated with the connivance of official dealer s. They find customers who have been on a wa iting list for two or three year s, but who are willing, for a price, to give up their new car and begin the wa it again.” 41 Some Eastern counter-economists s eem to have it better than “Fr ee World” workers, beating inflation. “Wh en consumer prices rose 50 perce nt or more in Hungary this summer, a carpenter in a tractor factory said he c ould easily cope. His salary went up less than 10 percent, but his fees for fine cabinet work he produces nights and weekends doubled.” 42 Hungarians have their entrepreneu rial laborers, their travail n oir and schwarzarbeiters. “Then there are the ‘sparrows,’ a term used i n Hungary for the highly skilled workers who flit from job to job, increasing the ir wages by steady increments as demand shifts fro m one enterprise to another.” 43 And in competitive education, dep ending on the Counter-Economy, the Easterners may well be ahead of the West. “In Poland it has tak en on a new dimension, with ‘flying high schools’ spreading forbidden subje cts. These range from the rule of terror by Poland’ s Stalinist-era leader, Boles law Bierat, to the economics of Milton Friedman and Paul A. Samuelson.” 44 As always, we ask how it works.

Soviet Counter–Economics A major premise of counter-econom ic theory is this: the more go vernment intervention in the economy, the larger the Counter-Economy. In deed, as we have moved from the “limited gove rnments” of North America to t he “mixed economies” of the rest of the worl d, counter-economic activity has certainly not receded. Counter-Economics, moreove r, predicts that totalitaria n states should conduct nearly all economic ac tivity — in fact, all non-politic al and even much political human action — outside the area sanctioned by the Sta te. So a positive test of our theory would be to check out a totalitarian State i n some detail and observe the degree of counter-economic activity. A minor qualification is in orde r, though we shall see it is sc arcely needed for our test. The economic theory which forms the most basic level of o ur understanding predicts that no state can achieve totalitarian control. In fac t, Counter-Economics was discovered by this author whe n I followed that idea to furt her conclusions. But all the so-called totalitari an states — Third Reich, Soviet Russia, People’s Republic of China, even Cambodia — actually allowed and continu e to allow some “private” property and some freedom of trade. Nonetheless, most observers will grant there is considerably mo re state intervention in, say, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics t han in the United States. Therefore, there should be more Counter-Economics, as w ell. Let this point be belabored a little more. American conservatis m predicts that entrepreneurialism should be alm ost snuffed out under a totalit arian communist state, except for a few Bible-smugglers. Liberalism and democra tic socialism might predict some resistance to communism but that it would ta ke the form of intellectual dissenters and unde rground unions surfacing into “ Charter 77” and “Solidarity” organizations. Eve n what passes for libertarianism these days predicts less, rather than more, “free market” activity in enda rkened U.S.S.R. than in relatively enlightened U.S.A. So if Counter-Economics c ontradicts all these ideologies’ predictions — and it does — one has a quick s cientific decision in respect to their respective validity. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 What does reality say? We’ve seen a strong indication in our la st chapter looking at Eastern Europe, China, and I ndo-China, but we need a much lo nger, more detailed look at one such count ry. And if the Counter-Economy i s booming in the Soviet Union, the “hardest case” for our theory, then where are the millionaires? Save for a corrupt Commissar or two — even the Communist Party line will allow for such imperfection — w ho has heard of Russian capitali st pig millionaires in the 1980s? Consider this: “A few weeks ago the Manchester Guardian Weekly reported that several counter-economic millionair es were arrested in their Bl ack Sea resorts and dachas. Nearly all the governme nt officials in Armenia were also pulled in and broken by the Communist Par ty and denounced by the press. T he Armenian bureaucrats had been involved in a major black and grey market ‘ring.’ (Armenia had somewhat looser regulations and more private ownership allo wed than in Russia.)” 1 Armenia, it may be argued, is not Russia proper, though a “Sovi et Socialist Republic.” Then again, the Armen ian counter-economists were arr ested. How about neighbouring Georgia? “The parallel market represent s a huge economic structure, simu ltaneously independent from and associated with, the official Soviet econo my. This private sector penetrates every segment of Soviet society. People activ e in the parallel market vary, from petty speculato rs selling fashionable clothes to people of real influence and wealth, such as the famous Georgian underground c apitalist Laziashvily, whose connections include quite a few top official s.” 2 What about Russia itself? “I particularly recall one such spiri ted client, Abram Aizenberg — a massive man whose every movement expressed self-a ssurance. He was about 70, and he owned tw o factories manufacturing hosie ry and underwear that brought him an annual income of several hundred thousand rubles. Over the years he had a massed capital that the investig ators estimated at three million rubles.” 3 “After World War II, the three Glazenberg brothers were demobil ized, returned to Moscow, and soon realized that they could not bank on their being veterans to"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 help them find a good job; they were Jews — banned from all pro minent posts in the party and state apparatus. E ven Jewish engineers had a hard time finding employment in industry.” While s ome may question the ethnic pur ity of the entrepreneurs in question, this is Moscow our Russian reporter is talking about. “The Glazenberg brothers went into underground business. Upon d ischarge from the army they each received the large sum awarded to demobilize d officers — about 5,000 in today’s rubles — and acquired a single workshop in a factory to produce artificial-leather shopping bags. “They turned out to be talente d businessmen, and in a few years their company owned at least ten factories ma nufacturing artificial leather, artificial-leather goods, and all sorts of synt hetic fiber products.” Of course, knowledge of their activities comes from their publi c exposure, arrest and prosecution. “A firm operati ng on such a large scale could not escape the notice of the Moscow DCMSP (Dep artment for Combatting Misapprop riation of Socialist Property, the arm of th e Soviet police charged with f ighting economic crimes). Indeed, the DCMSP with its well developed network of s ecret informers, kept a special dossier on the Glazenbergs’ company.” 4 How did these Russian entrepreneu rs last so long as to get succ essful in the first place? “For some while, this in no way inhibited the busy entre preneurs — for they were paying off the top people in the DCMSP, offering a mo nthly balm of between 5,000 and 10,000 rubles.” And how did they get caught? “One day, however, a lower DCMSP officer leaked the story to a wellknown journalist at Izvestia, who began sifting throug h the material on the brother s’ company. In these circumstances the DCMSP chie fs were powerless to save the Glazenbergs — beyond warning them immediately of the danger impending, so t hey might have time to secrete their money and valuables.” So how did the ruthless, inhum an, infamous, Soviet secret polic e deal with these bloated capitalists? “Buffeted by the contrary pressures, a top DCMSP official decided in Soviet Solomonic style that 1.) the incriminating do ssier would disappear from the DCMSP files and 2.) the youngest Glazenberg brother, Lazar, would have to be sacrificed, at least partly because of his pla yboy lifestyle —"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 reflected in his two dozen suits and the wardrobe of his wife, a ballerina in the Bolshoi theater.” One supposes, at this point, whet her the proletarian masses wou ld revile or just ignore this exposed bourgeois. “ On the first day of Lazar’s tri al, the courtroom was packed with curious onlooke rs, dying to glimpse a millionai re. What they saw was a tall man of about 40 w ith handsome features and a man e of completely gray hair. Lazar Glazenberg walked, as prisoners are meant to w alk, between two escorts, with his hands folded be hind his back hobbling along o n the artificial leg that replaced the limb he had los t in the war. But he affably g reeted friends and relations among the crowd.” Nonetheless, as all have agreed, the U.S.S.R. is a particularly interventionist and repressive society. Our Horatio A lgerov was sentenced and shot, no? “Three months later he walked out of the courtroom just as calmly, hav ing heard his sentence: 15 years in strict-regime camps.” This is the home of the Stalin purge trials, where the top communist officials — the new Russian ari stocracy — are regularly rounded up and shot. A hardier entrepreneur might hav e survived and considered himse lf ahead. Alas, Lazar Glazenberg had “served hi s country” one limb defending th e Motherland. “It is almost impossible for a pe rson with one leg to survive 1 5 years in such a camp. He died seven years after his trial.” 5 Before one reaches for the handkerchief over this typically ironic Russian tragedy, rememb er the rest of the family got away with their w ealth and obviously enough capital to keep going. So were the Glazenbergs an isola ted example? Even if one assume s most are not caught and not reported, there s till are plenty who were. That is, there are plenty more where they came from. “Among other important undergrou nd family companies, the Bach c lan ranked high in Moscow, because of both the scale of its activities and the amount of its assets. The eldest member and head of the clan was Isaak Bach.” 6 All the proletariat’s representatives have to do is liquidate t he exploiting class to be free of them, says Marxism. “Here was a businessman of the o ld generation:"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 before the Revolution, he had savored the joys of legal commerc e in his father’s company. During the New Economic Policy after the Revolution, w hen private enterprise was permitted for a s hort while, his commercial abil ities were fully developed. The notions and ladi es’ underwear shops of Bach & So ns were then located on Moscow’s Kuznetsky Mo st street, amid the city’s most expensive and fashionable stores. But the New E conomic Policy soon liquidated the company, confiscating its merchandise and sending its head to the camps on the Solovetsky Islands.” That’s the end of Bach’s incentiv es and capital, right? “When B ach returned from the camps in the mid-1930s, he set about creating a new fa mily company — this time, illegal. By the la te 1940s, Isaak Bach, nominally a humble workshop supervisor in a zipper and safety-pin factory at 160 rubles a m onth, was head of a company owning at least a dozen factories manufacturing underwe ar, souvenirs, and notions, and operating a netw ork of stores in all the repub lics of the Soviet Union. He held assets assessed by the prosecution expert at app roximately 87 million rubles.” 7 No shortage of Russian millionair es seems to be evident. In fac t, like poker players, we can “see the 87 million” and “raise to 200 million, ” topping example with example. “In the 1960s, two of the younger generation of that clan — Bor is Roifman and his cousin Peter Order — were seized by the KGB. Both had been in underground business for about ten years. One turned over about 200 million rubles’ worth of valuables to the authorities, and the other ab out three-quarters that amount.” See and raise the 200 millions? “If three compara tively young members of the Roifman clan ha d amassed 350 million rubles, wha t might the whole family’s fortune amount to, after decades in business?” 8 Nor did these robber barons of the Russian 1960s lack any style or panache compared to their 1880s U.S. for ebears. “The chief investigator of the KGB Central Office asked the wealthie r of the two, ‘What did you ne ed 200 million rubles for?’ Peter Order replie d, with a show of bravado, ‘Only 200 million! I had wanted to make 220 million — one ruble from each Soviet Cit izen.’” 9 "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 Returning to Russian millionaires later, and how they manage to dispose of their income, the real question for an economist — counter or otherwi se — is where do they find their market? The Russian Real Market The Counter-Economy thrives in N orth America mostly in “forbidd en fruit” areas and those taxed to death. In Europe and Asia we can also add the overcoming of restraint of trade of otherwise legitimate foreig n goods — protectionism and its complement , smuggling. But in the Second World of Communist states, two other sources arise: consumer black-ward goods’ quality and reliability and their availa bility, something most North Am ericans take for granted. “The parallel market offers not only better, usually foreign-ma de, clothing or rare editions of popular authors, but also provides Soviet citizens in a position to pay with better medical care, better education and training, better vacations, better interior decorating for their apartments, better babysitting fa cilities, better transportation, even identifica tion papers, diplomas, and other documents. More than that, not only private individuals but governmental firms, agencies, and collective farms frequently use services of the parallel market in their efforts to obtain equipment, spare parts , manpower, and professional exper tise.” 10 Consider the problem — as it is in the U.S.S.R. — of driving an automobile. Remember, while reading the follo wing portrayal, that cars are in short supply to begin with and probably require a bribe to obtain. Now try driv ing it — without the Counter-Economy. “There is a shortage of service stations in the Soviet Union an d those which exist just don’t have spare parts. A fri end of mine spent a month in an effort to buy a windshield for his Moskvitch. All in vain.” Unlike police, there is usually a counter-economist when you ne ed one. “Finally he came to a small street, near a n automobile plant in Moscow, where he was approached by somebody who intro duced himself as a worker at th is plant and promised to deliver the windshield the same day for a reasonabl e compensation"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 — even less than the official p rice. Needless to say, the worke r kept his promise.” 11 One also gets what one pays for in the Counter-Economy, so reli ability is important in attracting consumer s. (Of course, the governments in all countries spend fortunes on propaganda to convince you of the unreliabili ty of black marketeers — and the unfailing re liability of government servic es.) Examples abound here. “A car owner in Armavir in southern Russia sent a letter to a driver’s magazine, reporting that he was refused help at a serv ice station. ‘But then, a worker standing nearby chimed in: let him bring it in, he said. I’ll fix it quickly.’ And the ‘sharpeared’ m echanic carried out the job on the spot, pricing it at six rubles. ‘Five rubles for me, and one for the till.’” 12 Six rubles would be cheap at a U.S. garage. And again: “Another driver, from the Crimean city of Yevpatoria , complained that, although he parked his car first at the service station, attendants did not pay any attention to him and started to inspect other autos, which arrived later, presumably because their drivers had promised good tips. His pr otests did not help and according to the letter from this customer, the things he saw and heard there made him wonder whether it was a state enterprise or a pr ivate concern.” 13 Obviously it was the latter. Som e may find it encouraging that there’s a paradise where the masses know how to scorn an economic law-abider... thou gh Russia may not have been where they thought to look for it. But an imp ortant point in the first example is missed if one ignores the necessity of con ducting the business counter-economically. “Thousands of business executives ha ve been put in jail for all eged violations of the Soviet legislation. Many of these trials would look rather peculiar to a foreigner. The thing is that, i n quite a few such cases, even t he prosecution did not insist that defendants took a penny for themselves. The acc used were stealing, selling at the parallel market, and buying stolen goo ds, not in order to make a fortune but just to get necessary supplies for their ent erprises and collective farms.” 14 "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 That last statement, to be sure, is devastating. If true, the r eality of the market has smashed the facade of communism, as Marxists like to put it, ob jectively. And this reality penetrates to the finest details. “Literaturnya Gazeta tells about two collective farm chairmen, convicted for buying stolen property from thieves. One purchased desperately needed pipes for a crew-shed; the other, boxes to pack apples. Significantly, no personal profit was involved in either case. Both collective farm chairmen, pre sumably, did not have a chance to get pipes and boxes through normal state suppl y channels. One of these chairmen later asked in desperation: which is more cri minal — to pay thousands of rubles to thieves or to lose a harvest? This was t he real alternative he faced.” 15 In a showdown between the objec tive forces of the market and th e subjective forces of statist ideology, the f ormer is as inexorable as the “forces of history” are supposed to be to a Marxist . “There was a meat store close to a place where I used to live in Moscow. For many years, this store was known fo r having an unusually good choice of meat. But , suddenly, steaks, lamb legs , and other rare items disappeared. Salesmen told the story of an old director, a Jew without a high school education but well-ad justed to unofficial rules of the Soviet trade, who was replaced by a Plekhanov’ s Economic Institute graduate. The new director declared that he would not tolerate any violations of law in his store. He refused to bribe district ware house officials and, consequently , supplies of meat were almost cut off. The salesm en could no longer make a living by taking fees from grateful customers for w hom they used to save good pieces of meat. Previously, they had shared the ir underground income with the f ormer director, providing him with muc h-needed reserves of unregistered cash. N ow the practice was stopped. But, without free cash, the director was unable to pay truck drivers for unloading their trucks and the drivers refused to do it fre e.” And so the market responded to t he director’s ideological prono uncements. “Both truck drivers and salesmen, angered by the new regulation s, began to complain to district party committee. The former director would easily take care of such charges, merely bribing the district committee official s. But the new one found himself in real trouble. More, without supplies of good m eat, his store was failing to fulfill the plan. Ever yone was sure that, soon, the director would be"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 dismissed.” A happy ending to this tale? “But it did not happen . On the contrary, steaks, lambs, partridges reappeared in the store. There was no need to ask how it happened. It was clear that th e young economist finally learned the real rules of Soviet trade that he had not been taught at the Plekhanov Insti tute.” 16 How It’s Done The simplest of economic studies informs us that one needs cust omers, labor, and capital goods. One can use one’s own labor, take goods availabl e — say, on the factory where one ostensibly wo rks, and find customers in passe rsby, relatives, and friends. This is done in the Soviet Union, as it is everywh ere else. But the more interesting cases, which doc ument the activity of largesca le counter- economic activity, need distribution networks, hired laborers, and trade with others for capital goods (production). How is that done in Russ ia today? One can buy an existing business , but even that is not simple “ when the owner- sellers have no rights in law.” 17 One actually buys a network of connections and the trust of those countereconomists. But it can be done, with the all-important acceptance of reasonable risk, and is done. “The prospective purchaser obviously has no way of previously a ssessing the enterprise’s potential producti on, sales, or income. Buying and selling underground enterprises thus can su cceed only in an atmosphere of complete trust among all parties and resp ect for the unwritten laws of t he milieu. In this atmosphere, the purchaser hands over to the seller, with no rec eipt and no witnesses, tens — often hundreds — of thousands of rubles. In a case where the parties do not trust one another, the money is transferred to a third party trusted by both principals, and he passes it on to the seller only when all conditions of the sale have been met.” 18 Those even superficially acquain ted with Western business may n ote that, save for the increased risk from a hostile State, the method is simi lar to that practiced in the West. In fact, all economic activities can be practiced counter- economically when the risks are acceptable. "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 The fascination of Counter-Economics, besides that arising from its freer nature than that of approved, regulated , and controlled business, come s from the modification to standard business practices whatever they are, as they change in time and space. As we have seen and will see, it is quite possi ble that the modifications to reduce risk or even outright scofflawing may b e cheaper — far cheaper — than submission and co mpliance. The implications of t hat will be dealt with at the end of the book. Delving into the inner machiner y of large-scale counter-economi c business is difficult. Existing ones have little incentive to “blow their c over” even in Western publications, which, after all, are readily available a nd scanned by the KGB, if not the DCMSP. But the Lazar Glazenberg case did reveal the workings of that medium-size operation wh ich, although finally broken, o perated successfully for a long time. The Glazenberg brothers, by the w ay, even had a board of directors. 19 Here, in lengthy detail, since t he core of our case is being de monstrated, is how it worked: “The position of those officially in charge of the factories ho using the Glazenbergs’ enterprises was unusual: they exercised no control over the production and economic activities of their enterprises, this c ontrol being assumed by the Glazenbergs or their appointed managers. The off icial directors’ functions were purely decorative and boiled down to liaison wit h party and state organs. Through trusted agents, t he Glazenbergs normally paid t hem 500 to 1000 rubles a month, depending on the size of the enterprise and the usefulness of the director. One of their operations was run under the cover of th e Fisherman- Sportsman Sporting Goods Co. in Moscow, and they paid its direc tor 1,500 rubles a month because he held th e important title of Hero of t he Soviet Union.” 20 So much for the “bosses.” How about the working class? “Obvious ly, the complicity of many blue-collar wo rkers is also required in the manufacture of left-hand goods. It is almost im possible to recruit an entire l abor force on the basis of total trust, but the Glazenberg system contrived its o wn incentives. The laborers knew full well that goods were being produced off the books, but they"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 111 were interested in the extra m oney paid for left-hand productio n — higher than the official rates and not subject to taxation.” 21 And how about the capital goods n eeded? “The Glazenberg brother s cooperated with other underground businesse s: clasps for handbags, buttons for leather jackets, and labels were all manufactured to their specificatio ns by underground enterprises in Moscow, Vilnius, and Riga. But the main source o f materials — and here the Glazenbergs were no different from other undergrou nd enterprises — was the factory itself: materia ls saved from what the factory received for its official production — that is, m aterials stolen from the state. ” 22 The Soviet State was particularly interested in this alleged th eft; after all, it uses remarkably similar means, mora lly speaking, in acquiring those goods in the first place (as do all states). We may thank the diligent prosecutor for the rest of our information. “The quantity of off-the-books merchandise produced from these ‘saved’ materials provoked the major arguments between prosecution and defense during the trial. The point was vital to the defendants, for the quant ity of materials saved for left-hand production would determine the gravity of the jud gments against them — from 15 years in prison to death. “The prosecution was able to prov e that reserves were prepared in advance to yield secret surpluses. In the planning stages for production o f a new product, the Glazenbergs would negotiate with the people in laboratories or institutes responsible for setting the factory’s norms for new materials n eeded as well as for allowable wastage. In return for large bribes, these techni cians deliberately inflated the usage and waste norms, thus allowing the creation of huge surpluses for manufacture of merchandise off the books. “Other sorts of secret economies were made during the manufactu ring process. Expert witnesses testified in court that they had measured coat s and jackets legally manufactured at the fact ory, and the measurements did n ot tally with the sizes on the labels, because the f actory’s cutters had reduced the size of each pattern piece. Chemists testified that they had analyzed the ar tificial leather"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 legally produced by the Glazenberg factory: the quantities of d yes and other ingredients fell short of the official specifications.” 23 Finally, let us stick with the Glazenbergs a little longer and solve the last and crucial problem: distribution. “One would think that in a country like the Soviet Union, where trade and both the wholesale and retail levels i s a state monopoly, the large- scale marketing of left-hand merchandise would simply not be feasible. The Glazenb ergs proved otherwise. When the brothers wer e beginning in business and the ir only product was shopping bags, it was easy to solve the problem of how to s ell the left-hand bags. Employers of shops selling the factory’s output were quit e willing to accept for sale a certain quantity of illegally produced bags as well. Of the proceeds, one-third went to the shop employees, two-t hirds to the Glazenb ergs. “As the business grew and the range of their wares broadened, t he Glazenbergs’ sales outlets had to grow too. T hrough friends and family conne ctions, they added to their network stores that had not been supplied with t heir factory’s official merchandise. In time, e ven this network of retailers p roved too small for the Glazenberg empire. So a speci al marketing group was establi shed — to travel the country and in short order to organize sales outlets in 64 towns and regions.” 24 Counter Reaction to Counter-Economics “The Soviet regime scarcely can feel comfortable with the huge scale of the parallel market activities. First of all, a totalitarian state, by its very nature, cannot appreciate any initiative coming from outside the instit utional system. It sees such initiatives as a threat to its control over the econo my and the people. A totalitarian state does not like it when some of its citizens b ecome, at least partly, financially independent from the regime — when their fortunes d o not totally depend on the State.” 25 Dropping the words “Soviet” and “totalitarian” in the above par agraph changes nothing. No State appreciates initiative by its citizens outsid e its control. See chapters one and two to begin w ith. What is significant here is the helplessness of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 the State toward counter-economic activity and the potency of t he individuals. This is not just “power to the people” but power to the individ ual person. And the most totalitarian expression of collectivism cannot cru sh it. Worse, the CounterEconomy corrodes, corrupt s, splinters, and ultimately sm ashes the State. Besides winning away its citizens and restoring “public goods” (tax plunder) to the “private sector,” “The black market also causes serious eco nomic distortions and interferes with official ec onomic plans. From the point of view of governmental economic agencies, e quipment and supplies, which a re obtained at the parallel market by some ene rgetic managers, could be needed more and could be used more effectively by other firms and enterprises.” 26 But that “need” is in the judgment of the State’s pla nners; the people have spoken, c ounter- economically, that the need — dem and — is otherwise and overrul ed the entire Soviet State. “Moral considerations are also a factor here. Underground activ ities with their secret operations create far-reaching psychological consequence s for large sectors of the Soviet populace. And private enterprise is absol utely inconsistent with an official communist ideology.” 27 The mighty Soviet State must not only put up with the Counter-Economy but put up with its encroachmen t on its territory and people. Far worse. The Soviet leadership itself is not free of counter- economic taint. “It is fair to say, while authoriti es are basically opposed to the parallel market, they are forced to live with it and, s ometimes, do not hesitate to u se it.” 28 Both Pravda and Literaturnya Gazeta report au thorities ordering underlings to seek out face- saving (and other-saving) parts and other capital goods in the Counter-Economy. “Literaturnya Gazeta tells about officials, pressuring collecti ve farm chairmen to go to the parallel market. Accord ing to the paper, these offici als suggest to the chairmen whose farms are short of spare parts for agricultural machinery to fish for parts ‘at the bottom of the sea’ but to fulfill plans. They even promise chairmen their sponsorship in case of any trouble with the poli ce. The story carried by Literaturnya Gazeta also tells about construction ma nagers who did not get nails but were advised by their superiors to fulfill pl ans at any cost.” 29 "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 It should be stressed here that it is not only the segment of t he Counter-Economy that the U.S.S.R. considers illegal, or, segments that, say, th e U.S. allows that is involved, but all the Counter-Ec onomy. A lurid example is provi ded by Simes that could apply to U.S.’s CIA, F rance’s Deuxieme Bureau or SDE CE, and Britain’s MI6. “Prostitution is illegal in the S oviet Union. But the KGB co-op t many prostitutes dealing with foreigners, and pros titutes paid in foreign curren cy surrender part of their earnings to the KGB cashier.” 30 The official people’s pimp? And it should be stressed that the free market does not grow be cause government gets more liberal (or libertari an); rather, the counter-economi c defiance of the people forces the State’s retreat in order to hang on to what p ower it can. “Generally speaking, during recen t years some kind of tolerance , if not approval, has developed in the Soviet Uni on regarding certain kinds of pa rallel market activities.” 31 Next thing you know, we’ll hear Izvestia will give countereconomists a sympathetic hearing and Leonid Brezhnev wil l call for repeal of economic laws. “In an editorial introduction written by Izvestiya to an articl e about two engineers who get in trouble with authorities for precisely such actions, editorial writers have clear sympathy with the pe ople who were forced to break th e law in order to do ‘their important job’ properly. Both article and editorial a s well as numerous other statements made by Soviet journalists and officials, incl uding General- Secretary Brezhnev, call to elim inate ‘unjustified limitations and small-minded regulation’ imposed on th e economic management.” 32 What more can one say? The One Failure of the Counter-Economy There is a problem and a questi on yet left to be answered about the massive Soviet CounterEconomy, and the answers will bear strongly on th e analysis and study of the rest of the world’s Counter-Economy. Before answer ing, one should point out that only a narrow definition of economics has been d ealt with so far and much of the Soviet Counter-Economy, the underground intelle ctuals, the famous “dissidents” in all the ar ts and humanities, have been s hortchanged here."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 Still, they have much more coverage in the Western media than s trictly-business activities, which have only the pitifully few sources footnoted here. Smuggling and refugees also have a chapter to themselves. Other references to the rich — counter-economically s peaking — material and example source of Communist-controlled countries will be found sprinkled in the r emaining chapters, which are categorical rather than geographical. Geogr aphical divisions are, counter-economically at l east, largely irrelevant. At leas t politically, counter- economists are determinedly, def iantly, even scornfully, intern ational. The problem cited is this: What do the wealthy counter-economis ts do with their wealth? There are two answers to that, and the second bears on the question yet to be asked, which is “Why doesn’t the Counter-Economy become t he Economy?” First, the wealthier Eastern c ounter-economists m ay sometimes b e able to leave with their money and enjoy the pleasure spots of the rest of th e world. Even Russia has Riviera-like areas on the Black Sea, but ostentation in the latter requires explanation to officials. True, and more often than ma ny would think, making the wealth, reinvesting it, and making more is a prized end in itself. James Garner’s character in the 1963 film The Wheeler Dealers e xpressed it as “making money is just a way of keeping score” and that’s in rel atively free, wideopen Texas. Even so, milliona ires in the West are legendary for concealing their wealth — Getty, Hughes, Koc h, and other reticents are as common as the ostentations of Hearst, Hunt, and Hammer. The Western official confiscator has only a slightly shorter leash than his Eastern colleague. Still, blowing a wad in Brezhnevland is the pits. “The Soviet u nderground millionaire’s principal aim it not to spend money, but to conce al it.” 33 Georgia, homeland of Stalin and privileged, is not too bad: II But the r ange is enormous: the underground millionaire’s lifestyle in Moscow or Odessa, fo r example, is very different from his counte rpart’s life-style in Georgia. “One Georgian client of mine, G olidze, who was tried by the Geo rgia Supreme Court, openly and legally owned two magnificent houses. Both we re luxuriously furnished with antiques bought from dealers in Moscow and Lenin grad. During a"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 search, authorities confiscated his wife’s jewelry, and 45,000 rubles in cash — which Golidze explained to me was just lying around at home to cover day-to- day expenses.” 34 So things are tighter in other Red lands? “The Georgian life-st yle is not remotely appreciated by underground milli onaires in Moscow, the Ukraine, and the Baltic Republics. Forsaking the communal apartment bought under his ow n name, where he can enjoy expensive f oods without having to hide them from the neighbors ... buying a modest dacha under a relative’s name ... or taking a trip to a Bulgarian resort on the Black Sea ... all this is about the ext ent of pleasures that a millionaire of the older gener ation dare allow himself. His p rincipal entertainment is getting togeth er with male colleagues in priva te, and the eternal male need for a bit of fun outsi de the family circle is satisfi ed by several salons maintained by women with socia l or business connections with th e underground milieu. The attraction of these sa lons is gambling rather than sex.” 35 One can readily see that providing entertainment for the fun-lo ving, wealthier countereconomists is itself logically, a counter-economic enter prise. “During the 1960s and 1970s, the salon of one Elizabeth Mirkien enjoyed gre at popularity in Moscow. Her husband had been in the employ of one of the large underground companies and was at the time se rving a prison sentence. In the spirit of the unwritten laws of the milieu, the husband’s partners were provi ding Elizabeth with a decent sum of money each mont h, but she also had an inco me from the salon of her small two-room apartment. Middle-aged businessmen liked to assemble there. Everything was to their liking: the head of the house herself, a handsome and affable lady; ex cellent meals; and, above all, the card tables and roulette wheel. The stakes were very high, for games of chance occupy a very important place in the life of a wealthy underground Soviet bus inessman. Only at the card table or the roulette wheel in some house such as Eliz abeth’s are they able to risk huge losses, feel th e euphoria of spending reckles sly, feel rich.” 36 And yet, save quantitatively, is that a different attitude from that found in Monte Carlo or Las Vegas? Why does the Counter-Economy not b ecome the economy? The one fa ilure of the CounterEconomy so far, is on the mental-spiritual-psycholog ical level — the abstract level. As we shall see , the scientists and engineers o f abstraction, the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 intellectuals, have failed so far to analyze and justify the Co unter-Economy. Thus Counter-Economists operate under the dead weight of unearned gu ilt. The effort to change this around, to provide t he Counter-Economy with a fu llblown, self- justifying philosophy — agorism — has just begun. 37 Nonetheless, the guilt and self-i nhibition is evident in Russia as in the West. “The oldergeneration millionaires , beyond indulging in such ple asures, try to shield their children from the risks of the underground world a nd make them into academics, doctors or lawyers.” 38 That is to say, the children are to be made respectable and above-ground. This thinking and the failure to generate, so far, a supply of pro-market ideology, is the failure of the Counter-Ec onomy. The Hope of the Future But the children, the second ge neration counter-economists, are showing signs of appreciating the innovation and courage of their forebears — mo re than the forebears did — and may themselves conclude the liberation. The ir parents try to get them out and into Communist acceptability. “Despite this, m any children — after university degrees, even doc torates — reaffirm the family tradition and enter underground business. Th ese second- and third-generation underground businessmen are not content with the lives of their fathers. Th ey become habitués of expensive restaurants, whose waiters and managers know them by name, treat them as honored guests — and report their binges to the DCMSP. They are not afraid to make large bets at the races, watched by DCMSP agents , or too timid to buy cars and dachas at prices equivalent to 20 to 30 years of t heir official salaries. They openly visit fashionable resorts, spending five years’ official salary on a month’s vacation.” 39 Nor is their defiance and “coming out” folly or self-destructiv e bravado. From their parents’ knees, these New Counter-Economists know what th ey are doing, and their ingenuity surpasses their teachers. “This does not mean that the younger generation of underground businessmen are lunatics prepared to trade one year of high living for many years in the prison camps. They all try to be prepar ed to justify their expenditure s by pointing to some sort of legal income. A co mmon way is to buy a lottery tic ket or"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 government loan bond that has had a big win. The biggest of the younger businessmen retain paid agents among bank employees who persuad e winners who come to pick up their money to sell the lucky ticket for tw o to three times the amount of the win. But the main insurance for the younger g eneration remains the bribing of DCMSP officials — at which they outdo ev en their parents.” 40 When everyone is linked by self-interest to their fellow counte r-economists, in whole or part, in Russia or anyw here, and they are fully aware of this, the Counter-Economy will inescapably s ucceed. The base is there. “A ccording to the Soviet Writers Union weekly, Lite raturnya Gazeta, during only y ear, occupants of new Moscow apartments paid ten million rubles to private tra desmen for ‘additional improvements to their apartment.’” 41 Them And Us Confirmation of this state of affairs in the Union of Soviet So cialist Republics comes from the most Establishmen t of sources — The New York Tim es Russian correspondent, Hedrick Smith, ob served: “Corruption and illegal private enterprise in Russia, ‘creeping capitalism,’ as some Russians p layfully call it, grow out of the very nature of the Soviet economy and its effic iencies — shortages, poor quality goods, te rrible delays in service. They constitute more than a black market, as Westerne rs are accustomed to thinking o f it. For parallel to the official economy, there e xists an entire, thriving count er-economy which handles an enormous volume of hi dden or semi-hidden trade that is indispensable for institutions as well as individuals. Practically any materi al or service can be arranged nalevo [nalevo means ‘ on the left,’ but comes across a s ‘on the side’ or ‘under the table’] — from renting a holiday cottage in the coun try, buying a raincoat or a good pair of shoes in a state store, getting a sm art dress made by a good seamstress, transporting a sofa across town, having the plumbing fixed or s ound-proofing installed on your apartment door , being treated by a good denti st, sending your children to a private playsc hool, arranging home consultation w ith a top-flight surgeon, to erecting buildings and laying pipe in a collective farm.” 42 "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 As we have seen in the first two chapters, Westerners are rapid ly becoming accustomed to thinking of a far wider counter-economy. All the sources mentioned in this chapter convey this feeling of difference — w hich is valid — but with an implication of qua litative rather than quantitative difference. “Setting aside such sensational cases of abusing official positions, onl y a small part of the operations of the Soviet counte r-economy would be considered cr iminal in the West. To be sure, the Soviet Union has embezzlers, car theft ri ngs, prostitutes, narcotics traffickers, armed bank robbers, and an occasional ba nd of extortionists posing as police units complete w ith uniforms, handcuffs and do cuments, shaking down the innocent — offe nders who would be criminals an ywhere.” Including, it must be added, in the Counter-Economy itself. Smi th’s list is the red market of violence and coercion, not the peaceful, state-dodgin g black market. He continues, “But much of the pr ivate hustling on the black ma rket would not be illegal if Soviet Communism p ermitted the kind of small priv ate trade sector that exists legally under Hungarian, Polish, or East German bra nds of Communism.” 43 Such naivete is interesting for the many things it tells us. Wh ile it’s true that releasing some of human action as is done in the other East Eur opean countries would reduce the counter-economy slightly, Smith seems unaware how vast it is there. Furthermore, he is unawa re, it seems, how vast it is in New York City, his home base. Because New York is more highly regulated than the r est of the U.S. in many respects — taxi medalli ons, higher tax rates, for examp le — it swarms with gypsy cabs, unlicensed food vendors, non-union carpenters and movers, tobacco bootleggers, or “buttleggers,” and dealers in all illic it substances and prohibited copies (computer programs to records). Perhaps, like the New Class of Communist aristocrats he portray s in their closed-off suburbs a way from the suffering Moscow masses, he bel ongs to a class which avoids suc h street contact. 44 Smith does perceive, at least dimly, the revolutionary possibil ities. “But the regime faces a dilemma: As one R ussian, echoed by many others, observed to me, ‘Everyone in the Soviet retail trade is a thief and you can ’t put them all in jail.’” And yet he confuses reform with revolution near the end . “The Party knows, he reasoned, that people who are chasing after illegal g oods in the counter-economy are not worried about reforms. Moreover so long as the public"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 takes the counter-economy as a n ecessary and desirable fact of life, there is scant hope of collaboration for strict enforcement.” 45 The resolution in the Russian — and Western — mind of this dich otomy could well end the statism in favor o f a complete Counter-Economy. Of course, it would then be the economy, a fr ee market. Smith has an anecdote which illustrates the confusion of ec onomic efficiency and freedom wi th anti-social inhumanity. “A medical scientist who emigra ted to America in 1974 after wo rking at one of Moscow’s leading medical institut es praised Russian doctors as ‘more humane’ than profit-oriented private physicians in America and endorsed the concept of socialized medicine. ‘But you ca nnot imagine how poor is the ge neral quality of medical service,’ he said. ‘In R ejazan (a city of 400,000) wher e I grew up, they have very bad equipment. They l acked very simple things — medic ines for example. The qualification of the doctors is much lower than in Moscow. But the worst problem in the system is poor organization and bad nursin g service. The nurses do sterilization very badly . After operations, even in o ur institute which is one of the very top ones, we had a lot of sepsis, festering wou nds, infections, and suppuration. The nurses were not clean enough. They made mistak es in operations. Our institute director became very angry because he would do beautiful operations, and then there were those infections. So often, you know, the middle-level personnel do no t receive good pay and they are not reliable, not competent. Once I was in Kharkov and I had to be operated on fo r appendicitis in an ordinary district hospital. It was so dirty that you cannot imagine it. The sheets were grey from such long use. The clothes of the hospital worke rs were not clean enough. They took special care of me because I was from this im portant institute in Moscow. Still I got an infecti on and so did others. I saw on e man die in my presence after an appendicitis ope ration because of this proble m.” 46 This is the overground economy in the most statist area in the world. Small wonder people seek cold, profit-seeking marketeers who turn out clean, precise, antiseptic operations in mass production cheaply — or if they a re prevented, they will seek out black marketeers who will do it less cheaply but give the customer what he or she wants. Says Dimitri Simes, “The parallel market is a vital part of the Soviet way of life. And onl y fundamental economic and socia l reforms can"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 wipe it out of existence.” 47 But can they be fundamental enough, that is, will the State abolish itself? The forces of the market, overwhe lming the Marxist-religious Fo rces of History, may leave no choice. Although Konstantin Simis implies corrupti on — counter- economizing the statists themsel ves — is avoidable, his conclus ion speaks for itself in reply: “And there app ears one final revealing absurdi ty. Obviously, the Soviet state and the whole structure of underground enterprise are pitted against each other in absolute conflict and contradiction. Yet these ad versaries are weirdly allied. They are bound by corruption. There could be no vast labyrinth of lawless enterprise — not for a year, not even a month — without the complicity and the venality of the equally vast Soviet apparatus charged w ith enforcing the laws against economic crime. Thi s official criminality is all-p ervasive, from the lowest officialdom to the highest elite — a cancer plaguing not just the state but all of Soviet society. This is the awesome cost of a system ded icated to stifling the most basic impulses of personal freedom.” 48 That system is not Sovietism, o r even Communism, but statism. I t exists and is growing in North America. In the next few chapters, we shall se e how North Americans — and, now and then, t he rest of the world, deals wit h a world of bureaucracy and nalevo — of legal plunder and illegal productio n. First we’ll look at the biggest network of small entrepreneurs in the Count erEconomy, the drug market in all its aspects a nd definitions of what drugs ar e, and then the biggest problem of Counter-Economics in East and West alike: mo ney and its control and the ravages of inflation.

Drug Counter-Economics To many people, illicit drugs and black market are strongly con nected. The case for the existence of the counte r-economy of drug consumption, p roduction, agriculture, distribution network, financing, transportation, a nd smuggling, and even its use as an alternate curre ncy has been made in the popu lar press from High Times to the New York Times . Rather than making the counter-economic understanding of the dr ug market easier to convey for the author, t he preconceptions and prejudi ces involved make it the most difficult chapter in the book. Nonetheless, the iss ue is best tackled forthrightly and immediately. The problem is not the mechanics — though that is often misrepresented, as we shall see — but the intense irratio nality surrounding the subject. Drug abuse is a term in great need of disabuse . Drug Disabuse If we discussed the marketing of acetylsalicylic acid to beat B ayer Aspirin’s monopoly prices, few would be disturbed. Can we abuse “aspirin? ” Medical experts suggest that an excess ca uses stomach bleeding, so it s eems possible. Acetylsalicylic acid is a pharm aceutical item, sold in “drug st ores.” Where is the “aspirin abuse problem?” Let us look at tobacco. While heavily restricted in marketing b y anti-advertising regulation and taxed higher than anything else, it remains “leg al.” Nicotine, tobacco’s most active ingredient , is rated somewhere between ca ffeine and tetrahydrocannabinol (coffee and pot) in social acceptance, and is as much a “drug” as either. Today it is still legal and a much-maligned n onproblem. Should the final step toward outlawing of cigarettes and pipes be taken tomorrow, it would undoubtedly touch off a civil war in North A merica. While smokers have been “taking it,” in the form of constant nagging in the media and petty harassment at cocktail par ties as long as they could get their “fix,” they would flagrantly and massively d isobey any laws stopping them f rom obtaining it. Remember, a majority of peopl e — not just adults — of both sexes and all races outside the most poverty-str icken parts of the world smok e tobacco. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 One step from aspirin to tobacco , another to alcohol. Booze was slightly less popular and slightly more “powe rful” (disabling when over-consu med) and actually did meet with an era of Prohibition. Prohibition was not defeated by political reform, organized rev olution, or even street activists — though all were around in the United States in the 1920s. What is almost universally known is that it was abundantly and easil y available at a price little different from the legal, taxed price, and the “co st” of entering this market — in terms of additional risk — was so low that one ofte n drank in front of senators and even sheriffs with impunity. The failure of Prohibition to pro hibit was the most spectacular triumph of Counter-Economics in the Unite d States. Alcohol “in moderation” (whatever that is) is now almost completely acceptable. Alas, it is almost totally “white market” and taxed to death, s econd only to the taxation of tobacco products. Let us take one more step to marijuana along the drug spectrum. Tetrahydrocannabinol, at least a s found in joints (as opposed t o hash oil) is less powerful than alcohol. Yet its popular acceptance is lower; tha t is, its use is not enjoyed by a majority in the democratic countries. Hence, it is illegal. The Counter-Economy sector connect ed with marijuana is so large that it touches nearly every man, woman, and ch ild in North America (and much o f the rest of the world). This claim will be b acked up in the next section; a different point is being made here. Let us skip over one drug spectrum step: what about arsenic and cyanide? These substances are not only not illega l but not even all that contr olled. Is there any proscribed drug as capable of ha rm with as few “redeeming” side effects ? Why are not cyanide and arsenic the m ost persecuted drugs of all? P eople do take them. But in almost all journa lese you will never hear about “a nother arsenic- related death” Or “cyanide abuse. ” The usual term is suicide. "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 Whatever the potency and “threat ” of heroin, opium, lysergic ac id diethylamide, or amphetamines — and they lie b etween alcohol and arsenic by a nyone’s estimate — they are something “special” in the eyes of a large sector of society with considerable political clout. Is it a Puritan hatred of pl easure, then? How about the prohibition of Laetrile (which is also faltering at t he time of this writing)? Drugs are not a poison unless c hosen for that use. They are not a cure unless chosen for that use. They are not agents of pleasure or escape or stimulation unless chosen for that use. In s hort, the chemicals are irrelev ant to any “drug problem” — drug abuse is choice abuse . What one should choose is a religious problem, in the broadest sense of the term. Choosing the wrong drugs (and al most everyone chooses some, how ever “mild” or innocuous) is exactly like c hoosing the wrong religion a cou ple of centuries ago — you are an infidel, heretic , or heathen and you will be h unted down and persecuted. You will also be aide d, befriended, and even hidden from your persecutors by sympathizers with your beliefs. There is one major difference be tween most commonly understood religious practices and the use of drugs: the trade in physical goods. Wh ile there is a giant market in religion, outlawing associated material goods merely pinches the believers a bit and often ha rdens their convictions. Outlawing drugs discourages a few marginal buyers but just as o ften hardens the users and deepens their commitmen t. Would there exist the marij uana-based counter-culture or laetrilebased , mostly right-wing, movement i f the State had not suppressed their drugs-of-choice? And, of course, the line between drug culture and religion has actually been crossed many times: peyote-based I ndian and neo-Indian hippie s ects, the marijuana (ganja)-based Rastafari ans, and the numerous “accepte d” religions that use wine (persecuted during Prohibition) or food rules and diet ary restrictions (Orthodox Jews and fundament alist Christians). "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 One’s choice of religion has b ecome, largely, and in most count ries, no longer the business of the State. At least in the more enlightened cou ntries of the West, one’s choice of drugs is being pe rceived more and more as a que stion of individual conscience. Until this view prevails, the drug marke t is the greatest single recruiting and consciousness-raising sector of the Count erEconomy, with the exception of tax avoidance. 1 The Drug Capital Pyramid To understand the vastness of t he interconnectedness of the dru g market, one needs to introduce an important concept of economics, and to di scard a misconception mostly spawned by the propaganda of the Drug Wars fought by several levels and agencies of t he State. The latter is the myt h of the mob or “organized crime;” the former is the concept of the capital pyr amid. One is, in a sense, the mirror-image or perversion of the other. The term “organized crime” says too much. If you and your neigh bors work together to beat taxes or the draft or distribute and consume d rugs — anything the State considers a crime — you are a “conspiracy;” that is, by not working solo, you have committed an add itional crime. You are organized criminals and the organized government (some would say disorganized governmen t) dislikes that even more. The degree of f ormality of this organization ca n be very slight indeed. You may not even know per sonally those with whom you de al; you may simply meet, transact, and possibly never meet again. The marketplace spontaneously org anizes supply and demand, rega rdless of commodity. People need not add any ties or fondness or supporti veness to these ephemeral links but, being peopl e, they do, and we shall delve into this awareness expansion or consciousness raising later in this chap ter. The construction of a giant superst ructure across many borders and in minute detail on every street of agriculture, processing, shipping, refining, wholesaling, and distribution requires no long-term conspiring or formal organiz ation such as a syndicate or “Mafia.” Gangsters, the Mob, whatever they ’re called, are not the drug m arket or even part of the Counter-Economy; rather, they are the State within the S tate. They prey"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 upon the countereconomists by coll ecting “protection” taxes, re gulating trade, and fighting wars. The Cosa Nostra and the Purple Gang and such serve no function in the Counter-Economy save that of parasite in exactl y the same way the official government does in the market. In certain backward communities and neighborhoods, usually some elder ethnic culture, such groups a re tolerated or even supported by frightened people as real protectors, just as such authoritarian governments are accepted by the people of unenlightened countri es. Yet in the “hot” drug markets of the American university campuses and Sout hern California in particular, such mobste rs simply do not exist. If the Godfather doesn’t direct the black market, who or what d oes? Rather than some Sicilian’s Black Hand, the m arket is directed — without go vernment interference or in spite of it — by Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand . Someone realizes that people are willing to pay for drugs and t hat someone realizes that the price will get him or her a profit sufficient to make it worth his or her effort. Another realizes that there are these dealers wh o will pay well for a large amount of a drug — and will break it up for retail, marki ng it up to make it worth their effort. Yet someone else sees the opportunity in se tting up a chemical laboratory to refine drugs and deliver them to a few wholesaler s and another sees the profit in smuggling in drugs to a few refiners. And still a nother sees the value in supplying smugglers in their homeland from farmers in their area looking for a few extra dollars, pesos, or bat . And farmers see the value in dodging or paying off the government officials to grow a little extra of a forbid den crop. This “vertical” market structure — from layers of producers to a base of consumers — was discovered, as an economic concept, by Eugen vo n Böhm- Bawerk, the greatest Austrian ec onomist next to Ludwig Von Mise s, and called the Capital Pyramid. One of Böhm -Bawerk’s theories states that the more “progressive” the market, the hi gher the pyramid grows; that is , the base narrows and the height grows more layers . More and more wealth is trans ferred to earlier stages of production — yet the end product has finer quality an d/or, lower price. The Capital Pyramid of the drug market rivals that of space-shu ttle production — and it is growing, against a lite ral army of government agents, armed to the teeth and shooting. 2 "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 If anything can prove the unstoppable nature of the Counter-Eco nomy, the triumph of the drug market’s Cap ital Pyramid against the armed might of the State should. So here is some proof. The Second World War — Against Drugs It’s been said that if Man will not learn from history, he is c ondemned to relive it. Two World Wars may still not have cured us of world war, but at least there’s been a longer gap between them. I n the 1920s, the United States imposed a Prohibition on the drug ethyl alcohol in all its forms even as various provinces in Canada were repealing local pr ohibition as failures. In 1933, t he First World War — and it was fought across borders and on the high seas — again st Demon Booze ended in surrender with the Repeal of Prohibition. Soon a fter, the State in all countries stepped up its s uppression of thousands of other chemicals ingested by humans for pleasure, escape, o r stimulation and held it seem ingly at stalemate. Then came the 1960s and the new philosophies, and the rise of p sychedelic drugs. A new war was declared by the State against lysergic aci d diethylamide and peyote and STP, and the old one with cannabis sativa and am phetamines and tranquilizers (“uppers and downers”) was redoubled. “War” is not a metaphor here. “Th e U.S. Coast Guard reports tha t on two separate occasions in recent mont hs, U.S. gunboats were forced to fire shots directly into the hulls of ships carrying marijuana. Coast Guar d officials say this is the first time since Prohibition — almost 50 years ago — tha t smuggling boats have actually been fired upon and hit by Coast Guard ships in t he process of making arrests. “Commandant John Hayes says that until the two recent incidents , seizures at sea have required, at the most, a warning shot or two across the bo w to force the vessel to surrender. Neither of th e shooting incidents resulted in injuries. Hayes says that more and more ships are trying to outrun Coast Guard cutters because marijuana has become a big bus iness, with single cargoes worth millions of dollars. The Coast Guard estimat es that $6 to $8 billion in ill icit weed was successfully smuggled by ship s into the U.S. last year.” 3 "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 The United States, largely through the Drug Enforcement Adminis tration, has opened up fronts on the war throughout Central and South Americ a, both ends of Asia, and Western Europe, a true World War. Yet, “home-grown” r emains the biggest source of raw drug material, as our look at California and Hawaii will reveal. There’s nothing foreign or alien about drug-dealing, bu t the market is completely international. Colombia is described by United Press International as a “Pot E mpire.” Riohacha “is the capital of La Guajira state and the hub of Colombia’s b iggest illegal industry — growing and smuggling marijuana in the United States . It is also a key outpost in the government’s battle to reduce the drug traff ic, which threatens to overshadow all of the count ry’s legitimate business.” 4 How big can this one sector of its Counter-Economy be? “Estimat es of the total Colombian drug business vary, but it is generally put at around $2 billion annually. A good part of the ‘pot ’ lands in the hands of intern ational dealers based in the United States.” 5 Colombia is also a distributi on and processing center for diffe rent drugs from different countries; it also maintains one of the largest singl e labor forces of the Counter-Economy “Colombia also i s one of the countries where co caine from Peru and Bolivia is processed for shipment to the United States , mainly by gangs operating out of the cities of M edellin and Cali. However, the white powder accounts for less than half the do llar value of the marijuana t rade and involves a much smaller labor force than t he 150,000 persons involved in ‘ pot’ trafficking.” 6 To really get a feel for the large scale of this particular ind ustry, one needs to absorb an eyewitness description. “At an army base outside Rioh acha, soldiers in T-shirts and fatigue trousers stack scores of large bales wrapp ed in burlap bags. Tons of ‘Santa Maria Gold,’ prim e marijuana from the slopes of the Santa Maria Mountains, are being prepared for a bonfire of destruction afte r being seized in the latest army operation. “A dozen trucks confiscated in th e action are parked in a row. A few yards away are the mangled remains of a sma ll plane that crashed on the hi ghway near the army base presumably when on a marijuana mission.... Through the end of June,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 the armed forces had seized 80 ai rplanes in northern Colombia, nearly all of them registered in the United States. They include a DC-7, a DC-6, a Convair, and three venerable DC-3’s, along w ith many small twin-engine plane s. Of that total, 23 planes had crashed while attempting dangerous landings on ma keshift runways. A total of 72 boats, 308 vehicles, and 879 firearms we re also confiscated. “In the same period, 1,169 susp ects were arrested. Of the 186 f oreigners among the arrested, most were Americans. The army says it destroyed n early 38,000 tons of marijuana, including 50,000 bales ready for shipment an d the estimated yield of 25,250 acres. It also g rabbed 2.2 million amphetamine tablets ready for export and 74 pounds of cocaine a pparently by marijuana smuggle rs outside the main cocaine route.” 7 That massive drug bust must certainly have set back the Colombi an drug business, right? “‘We figure we h ave got our hands on less than 10% of the total production,’ an army officer said grimly.” 8 Note that 10% is lower than taxation rates in most countries. See, in our present example, how a counter-economic Capital Pyr amid builds a large community of common interest in defence of a black market . “The root of the problem is money — the dollars and pesos that convince the farmers to run the risk of raising the illegal crop and that tempt ill-paid po lice, soldiers, and even judges to collaborate with t he drug traffic. La Guajira ha s long been known in Colombia as an economically dep ressed area where dealing in contraband is considered a normal way of lif e. The local populace welcomes ou tsiders with the same open-hearted warmth that Tennessee mountaineers reserve fo r internal revenue officers.” 9 The comparison, as we have noted, is highly apt. “Ernesto Samper, president of a national federation of Colombia n financial institutions ... estimated that 150, 000 Colombians depend on mari juana for a living and said nearly all are sm all farmers and their families [are] low-level drug runners. If Colombia had legalized production, he said, it coul d have collected nearly $146 millions in taxes last year instead of spending a c omparable amount on enforcement.” 10 Another solution to the taxes spent on enforcement can be found in the previous chapters. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 This zealous state crackdown on the drug trade is atypical. Mov ing from the Latin American theater of this World War to the Middle Eastern theater — where Israeli, Arab, Christian, and UN soldiers abound — we see anoth er attitude. “Not far from where the harvester s were at work, soldiers were lazily waving cars on down the highway. To them, hashish was just another cro p. Some say this is among the best hashish in the world. They call it ‘Lebanese Red,’ ‘Lebanese Blond’ and other names. It is mad e from the marijuana plant — I ndian hemp, it is called in this part of the world — and it is marketed as oil or in flat pieces that look like the soles of heavy shoes.” 11 Except for the military attitude , the Colombian scene is repeat ed. “It goes out by truck and boat and plane, and is widely thought to account for as much as a third of all the money that comes into Lebanon. Lebanon has only a se mblance of government, but its banks are thr iving and hashish is one of th e major reasons. “‘I think we can say that without a doubt “hash” is the biggest industry in the country,’ a Western diplomat who tries to monitor the drug traf fic here said. Exact figures are hard to come by, but it is estimated that 80% of the Bekaa Valley is given over to growing hashish. So much land is in Ind ian hemp that the valley, one of the richest farm areas in the world, can no long er produce all the fruits and vegetables Lebanon needs.” 12 Most legal industries are nowhere near this size. Can this one drug industry be so vast and yet prohibited by the State? “And although growing has hish is technically illegal, the harvest comes in every year right unde r the nose of the law — or what is left of the law . The soldier directing traffic on the road, who cannot fail to notice that the hashish is being harvested, said : ‘Growing it is illegal, but it is not our job to stop it.’”13 The bureaucratic response is given to the unstoppable free market. And the market replies. The re porter of the above scene intervi ewed a nearby farmer. "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 “He was standing at the edge of his crop, which in a few days w ould be harvested and then dried in a small shed. Then it would be picked up by t he man who had come out earlier to inspect it, to assess the quality of the pl ants before agreeing on a price. ‘This is the best way to feed my family,’ the farme r said. ‘Without hashish, I would be a poor man.’” 14 While some may describe Lebanon’s government as having broken d own, there are certainly plenty of armies — most made up of religious type s with strong anti-drug tenets — marching up and down the country. Even with far more governments than most people f ace, the CounterEconomy survives. “The story is told of a grower who keeps two military vehicles — tanks — to p rotect his fields. It may be an exaggeration, yet it is true that the fields are v irtually never disturbed. Too many people have an interest in the crop. And it is generally accepted that the growers pay pro tection money to the many arme d militia groups that operate in the area.” 15 The interlocking network spreads out at all vertical levels of the Capital Pyramid horizontally as well. “One expert said that some hashish is flo wn to neighboring Middle East states, and that some is trucked through Syria to T urkey, then on to Europe. The chief client there is said to be the Netherlands. M ost of the hashish, however, is consumed in the Middle East. Egypt is the biggest b uyer.” 16 The drug counter-economy includes high finance, right up to the international banking system. “The farmers and middlemen are often paid in U. S. currency that has been ‘laundered’ a number of times before it reaches L ebanon in an effort to throw drug agents off the scent. One source cited the example of a buyer who took an Amsterdam bank draf t and deposited it in a Swiss ba nk. The money was transferred to Venezuela, t o Taiwan, and then to a bank in one of the Persian Gulf states before it finally arrived in Beirut. “Lebanese authorities estimate that $250 million came into the country last year in connection with the hashish tr ade. This year, the estimate i s for twice that figure.... ‘The banks are filled with money,’ a Western diplomat said...” 17 Over in the Far Eastern theater of our World War, we find a few differences on specifics but the counter-economic basics remain comfortably fa miliar. “Stashed"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 in airliner restrooms, sewn insi de baseballs, or taped to the b odies of smugglers, Pakistani heroin is reaching U.S. and West European cities in e ver-increasing quantities and causing internati onal concern, U.S. and Pakistan i officials say. Opium cultivation has dropped sh arply in this valley and other major poppy- growing areas of Pakistan. But w hat remains is apparently more than ample for a string of underground laboratories that began producing the cou ntry’s first heroin in the past year.” 18 Remembering that the Counter-Economy recognizes no state border s, we’re not surprised to find full market cooperation among those of differ ent nationalities and religious denominations up a nd down this Capital Pyramid. “ At least five Iranian chemists were known to be in the semiautonomous tribal territory of North West Frontier where the infant heroin industry is located and where law enforcement officers have no jurisdiction.” 19 “Heroin is much easier to transport — and conceal — than raw op ium extracted from poppies, and it pays to make t he conversion. Ten kilograms (22 pounds) of raw opium in the currently depr essed market here costs about $3 00 and yields a kilogram of heroin. This amount of heroin sells for about $10,0 00 in Pakistan, at least $45,000 in Western Europe , and $175,000 on the U.S. East Coast, a U.S. Embassy official said. Once in the hands of U.S. dealers, the h eroin is cut and sold in packets. The income to such dealers runs into the milli ons of dollars from a single kilo.” 20 The Counter-Economy is invulnerabl e to the State, not by using the State’s concepts of attack and defence , but by market methods — a way o f thinking alien to Statists. It takes governmental actions into account, along with supply and demand. “There is a glut of opium in P akistan because of low prices ari sing from disturbed conditions in the traditional ‘golden crescent’ marke ts in Iran and Afghanistan. Guerrilla warfare has made shipping raw opium thro ugh Afghan mountain passes too risky and the death penalty imposed by the Iranian revolutionary regime on drug dealers has dampened their enthusi asm for the trade: Filling the gap, Pakistani narcotic entrepreneurs secure d the refining know-"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 how and either used Persian Gulf sea routes or the numerous dir ect air links with the West to smuggle out the heroin, the sources said.” 21 The interchangeability of methods in the Counter-Economy is hig hly useful to entrepreneurs. Those who find the drugs involved unsavory might still learn valuable techniques for risk reduction. Within the drug industr y, one product line may be instructive to another. “‘A number of Iranians operating independently have been picked up in the past year through sheer inexperience,’ in the United States, said an American official. ‘But the Pakistanis have been sma rter by using networks which t hey had established earlier for hashish. ’ Pakistan lacks the domestic c onsumption on the scale of Iran in the past. But as heroin refining expands here, drug-enforcement officials fear that demand for opium will pick up.” 22 In 1980, economically depressed J amaica threw out the socialist government and installed Edward Seaga. Part of Jamaica’s problem was its chron ically negative balance of payments — a balance which, naturally, did not inclu de counter- economic exports. Seaga threatened to legalize the ganja trade and count marijuana in the balance of pay ments, which, nearly everyone ag reed, would have given Jamaica a positive ba lance and gotten the Internatio nal Monetary Fund bankers off its back. Rather than accept a return to sound accounting practices and a n extension of the free market — the U.S. could have always claimed a concession t o the local large Jamaican religion, the Rastafarians — the U.S. hiked foreign ai d and extended loans. The Rastafarians, by the way, constitute a third force i n Jamaican politics, but are largely anti-political, undoubtedly from their continuo us contact with the reality of the marketplace. (Rast afarians have a distribution n etwork throughout the U.S. and U.K. thanks to th e present popularity of reggae, t heir sect’s music, which is allied to punk rock.)

Unfortunately for those willing to fight on the beaches, to fig ht on the shores, and to fight on the landing grounds, the homeland has fallen. The l argest U.S. market — California — is also largely self-contained, literally from t he ground up. “In the remote hills and trackl ess valleys of northern Californ ia, it’s time to bring in what they call here the ‘ha ppy harvest.’ The grass is as hig h as an elephant’s eye in the shimmering noonday h eat. But the casual visitor rare ly spots the tall, saw-toothed plants tucked away in camouflaged, booby-trapped, a nd guarded plots. This fall it’s a bumper cr op, worth somewhere between $5 00 million (U.S.) and $1 billion — probably the most valuable cash crop in the go lden state, food bowl of America. And a lot of pe ople — small-time pirates, the Mafia, police in helicopters, posses of sheriffs’ deputies, federal narcotics ag ents — want to snatch it away from the growers.” 25 California drug agriculture is moving up to the level of King C otton or “flowing oceans of golden grain;” we’re talking counties , boy. “The crop is common hemp, canna bis sativa — marijuana — and in the past three years it has transformed the social and economic life of a vast five-county area of northern California, which stretches from San Francisco to the Oregon border. It is, of course, illegal , but in this 16,000 square mi les of rugged country, smallholders find the risks well worth the annual tax-free inco me of $200,000 and up that a diligent farmer can earn.” 26 Politicians are not necessarily “bought off.” There are places “the potvilles of northern California, oddly nam ed backwoods towns — Willits, Gar berville, Ukiah — where conservative old- timers and sharp, young universi ty-educated entrepreneurs have an uneasy allia nce. They want the law and th e political bosses in Sacramento, the state capital , to stay out of their business : in this area, long- depressed by a timber industry slump, pot is a godsend.” Still, the politicians try to jump on the bandwagon. “Stat e Senator Barry Keene announced that he was"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 pushing a bill to decriminalize cultivation. The physical ill e ffects of pot were not proven, he said, ‘and right now what I see is a multimillion-do llar business in the heart of my district.’ Some ‘very responsible members of the Ch amber of Commerce’ had asked him if it di dn’t make sense to decriminaliz e pot. Would it not ‘diversify the economy, broaden the tax base, and create jo bs in this high- unemployment area?’” 27 Whether or not the IRS could cat ch any more taxpayers is debata ble, but the Counter-Economy is already divers ified and creating plenty of j obs, not only without government intervention but in spite and in defiance of it. And, as always, we see the Capita l Pyramid and the horizontal n etworking of the CounterEconomy, as exemplified by the drug market. “Marijuana i s not merely a good crop. ‘It’s sent land values skyrocketing,’ says realtor R oy Johnson. ‘It’s not my job to fink to the Inter nal Revenue Service, to ask wher e these guys get their money. Hell, it would be discrimination if I refused to s ell them land.’ So, in Garberville, there are more real estate offices than saloons on the main street.” 28 One politician seems to be ready for another Prohibition-surren der of 1933 in the Drug Wars. “Mendocino County’s agricultural commissioner, Ted E riksen Jr., recognized the industry’s status by listing county production l ast year at $90 million. A higher authority ordere d the entry deleted. Amiable, easy-going Eriksen, whose forebears have liv ed here since the turn of the century, says: ‘I guess it’s one thing to make mone y from moonshine, another to a dvertise the fact.

Pot is thi s county’s No. 1 agricultural product. This harvest, it’ll bring in more than $1 00 million. People who refuse to recognize that are burying their heads in the san d.” 29 Fortunately for those who wish to see the market untaxed, unreg ulated, and counter-economic, the Holy Warrior hawks against drugs shall sm ite such compromising, realistic doves: “Next year [1982] is election ye ar in California, so ambitious state politicians don’t quite see it Eriksen’s way .

Cultivation today calls f or both science and tender loving care. It involves force feeding with fertiliz er, chemical and organic, and above all ‘selective breeding’ — the systematic re moval of male plants from the neighborhood of the female. Deprived of male co mpanionship, the ungerminated heads of the fem ale plant ooze a dark resin th at contains 10 to 12 times as much tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as do other varieti es.

Once it seemed that nearly every bag of ‘weed’ sold was purport edly Mexico’s Acapulco gold. Today, the great f ields south of the U.S. border are devastated annually with pesticides, and Mexi co’s share of the U.S. mariju ana market has fallen to an estimated 10 per cent.” 32 Could not the Holy Spraying Inquisition hit the home-grown here tics? “Now some California legislators want to use paraquat on the norther n plots. ‘Why should the taxpayer pay for armi es of drug enforcement agents t o go in there and seize the stuff when paraquat could do the job quickly and easi ly?’ asks Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates. “The answer is that growers, w ith heavy popular support, are ta king an over-our- dead-bodies stand against spraying (which kills forest underbru sh as well as pot plants).

National parks — where vast for est stretches off the beaten tra ck rarely see a tourist — and other federal properties are much favored. Says o ne narcotics agent in Ukiah, the county’s seat, ‘We’ve found farms in a dozen nati onal forests, at Big Sur, even on the Hunter-Lig ett Military Reservation (a huge military training ground).’ Others simply grow it in their own backyard. A 55-yea r-old grandmother, Jane Schimpff, recently arrested with a crop worth $50,000, said she had grown her 60 plants as ‘a hedge against inflation.’” 34 More on inflation eounter-economics next chapter.

And her associates know this well and live by it. “Two years ago Attorney General Deukmejian launched an all-out war on the farms, leading his agents pers onally into the fray, followed by TV crews. Armed with helicopters and an array of electronic warfare gadgets the strike force seized and destroyed tonnes of weed worth millions of dollars. “But despite the huge hauls, age nts say they probably seize les s than 10 per cent of what is grown in this area.” 36 Where have we heard this before? By the way, Florida is not so i nnocent of dope agriculture anym ore. “An aerial survey has uncovered at least 155 marijuana fields in 41 north and central Florida counties, the authorities reported yesterday. Federal and State agents have seized 51,189 plants since the surveying project began June 1, the Flo rida Department of Law Enforcement said. The cla ndestine fields included one in Levy County that contained 13,500 marijuana plants up to 12 feet tall.” 37 "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 The Network It does not matter which way the State goes in the near future. Should it legalize “grass,” “coke” and “dust” and “horse” will take up the slack i n the labs and distribution nets and farmers w ill “rotate their crops.” Some m arginal producers will move out, maybe into tax-ev asion counseling. On the other hand, should the State prohibit something new — thousands of drugs are discovere d every year — or old, like tobacco, the market will expand, and a few more ma rginal cases who were thinking about growing, truck ing, or dealing will enter. T he State cannot win — though some statists, making a career out of the Drug Men ace, can. And the Counter-Economy cannot lose, t hough the poor risks will get weeded out by arrests.

At this point, nea rly the entire population of North America is involved already.

This libertarian network, which some might consider an entangli ng web of corruption, spreads through the rural farming communities as fa rmers or their hip offspring diversify the crops blackly. Scientific labs get a li ttle moonlighting action and silent lab assistants and cooperative technicians jo in the network without membership cards. “Federal drug enforcers are ‘fa lling behind’ in the fight again st secret laboratories in this country that illegally produce stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens, congressional investigators said Friday. The Gen eral Accounting Office said in a report that th ese non-narcotic, dangerous drug s killed more than 3,200 persons in 1979 — more tha n five times the number killed by heroin, the drug enforcers’ primary target . Most of the synthetic drugs are produced in clandestine laboratories or div erted from the legitimate drug d istribution systems the report said. “A few DEA field offices have achieved ‘an impressive increase’ in the number of secret lab seizures — from 33 in 1975 to 234 in 1980 — but t he illicit labs continue to flourish, the report said.” 38 Garages may find they’re providing and repairing a lot of vehic les paid for in kilos rather than dollars Or at least in cash; in any event, yo u don’t fill out any papers on their jobs and don’t ask why they have hollow bumpers or hidden doors.

At th is point, vested interest seems an appropriate t erm for the strands linking the network.

The affinities and confid ence that fill out this skeletal structure may be extended to tax resistance, draft evasion, inflation protection (next chapter), and all the other forms of Counte r-Economics this book covers.

At least 11 tonnes a day go up in smoke, and consumers dema nd ever more potent Strains of t he drug. Former White House adviser and drug authority Dr. Peter Bourne estimates that the marijuana industry is among the top halfdozen money-makers in the nation, totaling around $50 billion. Bourne, an advocate of smaller pen alties for possession (but not of legalization), calls marijuana ‘the coun try’s most difficult drug problem, a politician’s nightmare.’” 39 And a counter-economist’s delight. One problem that these networks h ave is a problem in using mone y; that is, using the State’s monopoly currency. “Four million dollars, in small bills, is a bit like a St. Bernard: nice, but hard to hide. So when federal agents bur st into the office of a Miami drug ring last August, they found a pile of money the s ize of a small refrigerator. The $4-million haul represented two days’ cash fl ow for a smuggling operation, posing as a currency exchange firm, that a uthorities said had been operating in south Flori da for 15 months. The bust rep resents a new emphasis on an old law-enforcement tool — catch crooks by track ing their profits. Few drug dealers accept MasterCard or Visa, so wholesa lers quickly accumulate boxes, bags, and suit cases full of 10- and 20-dollar bills. “‘It’s a very severe logistical p roblem for criminals to move t hat much cash,’ says William Meglen, director of the Custom Service’s currency investigation division. ‘I mean, we’re talking bulk.’” 40"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 But the Counter-Economy is nothi ng if not innovative and ingeni ous. “Frustrated criminals sometimes try to trans fer the money in unusual ways.

In Florida, s tories of customers paying for luxury automobiles with shopping bags of money are c ommon. One suspected cocaine dealer paid cash for various parcels of real estate, a Rolls- Royce, and a 60-foot yacht. “Miami has become well-known as the Wall Street of this undergr ound cash. Federal authorities point to what they call the ‘grotesque’ amo unt of currency flowing into the Miami Federal Reserve Bank — where deposits ju mped from around $471 million in 1974 to over $4 billion in 1979.” 41 What the substance-of-your-choice vendors need to learn is what our tax rebels are learning: how to get out of the State’s money system, at le ast partially. And an additional reason, which they all share with the rest of the economy, is the State’s depreciation of the for ced medium of exchange — inflati on.

Inflation Counter-Economics Inflation: The Great Counter-Economizer Inflation connects and interacts with all of Counter-Economics from taxes to drugs (as we have just seen a nd will see more of presently) and beyond. Its effects, and the recent attempts to comprehend its nature and w orkings, have been a great radicalizer of Nort h Americans. Europeans of East and West and Third Worlders have been as much if not more affected by inflat ion, and taken counter-economic measures agains t it (most spectacularly in Pol and and the most inflationary Latin American c ountries) but consciousness-raisin g there has not matched that of North America, w here an entire genre of non-fic tion books emerged in the early nineteensev enties predicting further, more catastrophic inflation, advising measures to be taken against economic ruin (mostly practical measures for individuals and fa milies) and, most spectacularly, anticipating correctly the surge in gold price. Inflation touches — or contamin ates — so much of economics (and counter– economics) because money is involv ed in most transactions in a developed economy. The exceptions are easily listed: “psychic” profit of emotional gain and barter. But even many things — i f not most — done for love invo lve costs in goods and services, and “above-gro und” bartering is far more ex pensive than the equivalent market transaction w ith some form of money. (Counter -economic bartering is another concept entirely, as will soon be shown.) 1 The shock of sudden awareness of a n inflation victim who discov ers what money is and how his or her government manipulates it compares closel y to that of a comfortable patriot facing a draft notice and discovering that this war is meaningless. Or the shock of a conservative businessman finding out that the taxes which will destroy him not only were justified by his bel oved Constitution but that the Federalist government first organized under the Co nstitution promptly crushed the Penns ylvania Whisky Tax rebels. Yet war and taxes are often li ghtly felt by some victims and h arshly by others. Inflation is the great counter- economizer: it plunders all with out favor — though, it should be stressed, that plunder goes somewhere to someone. Widows,"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 orphans, the handicapped, and the devout religious retreatists are exempt from war and taxes — but not inflation. The very study of Counter-Economics and its development by this author began with the great Gold Bug Wave of 1972-73. Harry Browne in partic ular, along with Harry Schultz, and later Douglas Casey and John Pugsley an d many others, took a long step from the old free-enterprise economic movement largely identified with the political Right. Where these anti-inflation activists departed from conservatives was by advocating and demonstrating where in dividuals could take concrete actions to opt-out of the general economy a nd protect themselves. Conservative free-ente rprisers continued to urge su pport of a different government which would roll back the State through an y of the political parties: Democrats, Republicans, L ibertarians; even the leftist Peace and Freedom Party was considered as the vehicle for a time (1974). Harry Browne took yet another st ep beyond the How You Can Prosp er From The Coming Collapse genre with his H ow I Found Freedom In An Unfree World. Browne discovered loopholes in the State’s network of regulations not just in inf lation-protection but throughout the market. That is , one could legally — or at least not illegally — evade all taxation, inflation, and controls. Of course, this fr eedom had a high price in an unfree world. The flaws in Browne’s positions d iscouraged some of his large r eadership but encouraged others to take the ne xt step. One of the flaws of Br owne’s living- inthe-interstices was that one was forced to go where the State inadvertently directed. There was a further risk involved in that the governm ent could change its mind and clamp down — and usually would as soon as someone (like Browne) made these interstices public and popular. And so the final step was taken by this author and a few others in 1973: why not apply the lessons of evading the State’s regulations and contro ls to evading the State’s enforcement of controls? To the surprise of most of us, we theoretical types found a fully flourishing market already there — without awareness of why they should be doing what they were doing.

Several liberta rians who were involved in smuggling gold and then publicly displaying it, def ying the American States to arrest them and give them a test case, found that the y were left largely unbothered. The idea expanded: if the State was largely impoten t to suppress gold when it was illegal, then what was really stopping us from replacing the paper money of the United St ates with gold — at least in our transactions? And so it came to pass that a gol d bank (under an assumed name, of course) developed and is flourishing t oday. But to grasp the implicatio ns of this event and just how apocalyptic it is , Counter-Economics is going to h ave to review a little basic economics. The Nature of Inflation The word inflation is used in tw o ways, which adds to the consi derable confusion on the subject. Most often, it conjures up rising prices. The o riginal and proper definition is much clearer and w ill be used here. Inflation is the increase of a fiat (government-created) money suppl y. One of its consequences is a general increase in prices (though individual prices can go counter to the trend). Money is a medium of exchange. A s many who have experimented wi th the recent bartering fad have discove red, having something popular to trade, or to trade for, greatly facilitates fi nding trading partners. Someon e may want your oil paintings very much but you need shoes, not the music concert t hey’re offering. Maybe a shoemaker likes music e nough...? If half the trading part ners smoke, tobacco will (and often does) become a medium of exchange. Even non-smokers will accept it, knowing plenty of smokers to trade with. People historically went through several different media of exc hange. The more universally accepted the commodity was, the better money it mad e. Durability was useful for savings; who wanted their nest egg to spoil? And such things as easy divisibility for change, comp actness, and consistency of q uality all enhanced the monetary aspect. For good soli d chemical reasons, one subst ance became the obvious and unique choice — and its closest cousins in the chem ist’s periodic table of the elements were the favored alternatives. "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 Gold, silver, copper, platinum, a nd palladium — these are the m aterial forms chosen to embody the highly usef ul abstraction of money. In Fre nch, the word for money is silver (argent). G old is synonymous with money in Danish (geld). Pounds sterling were pounds of s ilver, even the dollar defined a (Spanish) measure of precious metal. Fiat money is money imposed by th e State. Sometimes the king me rely ratified the prevailing currency and was satisfied to put his royal or i mperial likeness on a measure of coined precious meta l to “guarantee” its value. Actu ally, the value was rubbing off in the other direction; how many rulers were as “good as gold?” Rather than guaranteeing the valu e, beginning at least in the R oman Empire, the rulers debased the coins by all oying with base metals or “clipp ing” the edges of the coin so that less-thanexpect ed weight (mass, actually, for the sake of purity) was tendered in exchange. Without going over the long history o f money in detail, it is fair to say that the relationship between State a nd money is corruption and fraud. If money is the root o f evil, the root of evil money is government. 2 Fiat money is money imposed by fi at. It is neither voluntary no r spontaneously generated in free trading betw een consenting adults. The United States alone has had several severe inflation bout s through fiat money, beginnin g with the “Continentals” of the Revoluti on. There is also a strong link b etween war and inflation: the Continentals, the Greenbacks of the Civil War/Wa r Between The States, severe inflation of World Wars I and II, Korea, and Vie t Nam. This is not a coincidence, Inflation is a for m of taxation and fighting war s needs lots of taxes. Like taxation, inflation must be enforced. The mechanism of imp osition of fiat money is the legal-tender law . One must accept the debased gove rnment paper certificates allegedly representing money or face legal penalty . In Nationalist China, just before the collapse of its control o ver the mainland, the inflation of currency was so sev ere (to finance the Chinese Civ il War) that merchants defying the monetary a nd price controls were lined up and shot by officials of Generalissimo Chi ang Kai-Shek.

(Price controls, often used to combat inflation — like holding down the mercury in a thermometer to combat fever — turn almost the entire market into a black market overnight.) Gold hoarding is common among even poor people in European and Latin American countries with repeated bouts of hyperinflation. North Americans are the most com placent people on the globe abo ut accepting fiat money as real money. One of the reasons is that the last c ollapse of the currency was two hundred years a go in the U.S. But the current escalating debasement of the American dolla r is shaking that trust and the flight to legal gold, foreign assets and foreign currency, and counter-economic substitutes is accelerating. Although there are a f ew secondary factors (which can be mostly eliminated by long-term averaging), the “price of gold” has not gone drastica lly up. Gold is the most stable medium of exchange possible. The price of the dolla r in terms of gold has dropped drastically. In terms of the original gold wei ght definition of the dollar (used throughout the prosperous, mostly hardmoney centur y from 1814- 1914), today’s dollar is worth three cents to a nickel. If any of you remember that at the turn of the century a beer with a free lunch cost four c ents, you can see the price ratio is still in line. It is fairly obvious that if people are free to choose their ow n money as some economists have recently suggested 4 — that is, people are free to refuse one form of money and contract for payment in another — then either the government will behave itself and simply superfluously certify the measure of t he money (which can always be checked by physical and chemical means) or govern ment money will be discounted and Gresh am’s Law will take over. Gresham’s Law has usually been s tated as “bad money drives out good.” (The “good” money is being hoarded and the “bad money” is given in p ayment and"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 152 thus predominates in circulation. ) This ends with the “Crack-Up Boom” when the “bad money” is worthless and only “good money” is left. The nature of inflation, then, is that it is a form of theft by the rulers of a country. The money supply is first contro lled by the government, and the n the State increases the number of units by various bookkeeping manipulati ons. More dollars chasing the same amount of goods is inflation in a nutshell. It does have other effects, but, save for a privileged few, they are ov erwhelmingly negative to most values of most people. In order to realize the apocalyptic nature of inflation and the growingly co untereconomic survival movemen t, a quick sketch of the long-range, catacl ysmic effects are needed. Inflation and Survivalism Inflation causes depressions; depressions motivate greater infl ation. The spiral repeats until a critical point at which the money system collap ses — the “Crack- Up Boom” of Ludwig Von Mises. A r ecent dramatic example was Ger many in 1923. The discrediting of the governing political parties led t o the National Socialist takeover and the Third Reich, an event most would con sider cataclysmic. It seems paradoxical that many a pparently level-headed investme nt advisors, market analysts, gold bugs, and such are heavily committed to “ end of the world” doom ’n’ gloom scenarios. The above sketch explains why. 5 Survivalists see a general, world -wide runaway inflation and co llapse of the money supply. Extrapolating pr esent conditions along historical ly verified economic lines proves them right. And so they store gold, silve r, and commodities in out-of-the-way f oreign places or in the North Am erican wilderness. The Survivalists are often willing to evade and break laws and controls. After all, if the end of the world is coming — and the government is respo nsible — why should the State be obeyed? And so they take the step into the Counter-Economy. "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 Typical counter-economic acts by Su rvivalists are tax evasion ( of course), currency-control evasion (to store their money safely and undis closed in foreign banks), building-regulation evasi on (for survival retreats), gu n-control evasion and drug-control evasion (to stock their retreats), contraband smuggling (if they wish a foreign retreat), and evasion of all compulsory disclosu re laws. This last one is necessary; if the government can reach you, your money, and/or your survival retreat when the crunch comes, what good were your pre parations? No survival results. By laying in gold and goods — and even the poor can do it 6 — the move to a counter-economic money system w as facilitated. It only took som eone to realize that one need not wait for the ev entual collapse to replace the money that the gold bugs and survivalists (now i n the millions), at least, rea lized was forcibly imposed, intentionally debased, and far less preferable to top commodity alternatives. And so the Gold Ba nk was introduced. And since so me of its operations — even with Browne’s intersticing — skirt the laws, and all of them will be declared illegal when t he inflation goes runaway (judgi ng by most historical accounts), the Gold Bank must be counter-economic. A nd it is. There is always the possibility t hat the government will come t o its senses and stop inflating. That hope was, at least for North America, crus hed by the election and “sell-out” of Ronald Reagan as president, generally conside red the hardest “hard money” advocate who could possibly get elected to power. His Gold Commission refused to back a gol d standard for the American dol lar, and, as this is penned, the money supply of t he United States is being pumpe d up for the next, higher than ever, turn of t he spiral. The demoralization of the moderate gold bugs may actually be enough to set off the flight into real goo ds at this cycle. (See footnote 5.) It may surprise some to find that the Counter-Economy actually offers considerable hope. The money suppl y could be replaced — illegal ly but peacefully — before the severest d islocations of the Crack-Up B oom. How it is being done (and how you can par ticipate) will be spelled out fr om the real-life example after one last preliminary. Counter-Economic Money "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 Ordinary people need protection against inflation. It hits ever yone (no one can actually obey all laws since ma ny contradict each other). Count er-economists (those described in previous cha pters and following chapters) n eed a safe currency. What does that mean? “A banker and three others were convicted Tuesday of participat ing in a scheme to launder drug money through Ga rfield Bank.... A federal jury de liberated less than two days before finding the four guilty of conspiracy and failure to comply with laws requiring banks to f ile reports on deposits of more t han $10,000.” 7 All counter-economists need way s of conducting financial transa ctions free from the prying eyes of government in order to lower their risks con siderably. In order to evade income disclosure, most are tax evaders as well. Some solve the problem by buying banks. “John A. Gabriel, a former preside nt of the [Garfield] bank and chairman of the board, was indicted along with the others in July. He pleaded g uilty on charges of failing to report nearly $500,0 00 in currency transactions. Gab riel and the bank have paid the government nearly $2.3 million in fines.” 8 Owning a fiat bank operating counter-economically is useful, bu t not much more risky than operating a gold bank. Gold also has the advantage t o drug dealers, smugglers, and all sorts of for eign-operating counter-economist s, of being a far more universal medium of exc hange than even the dollar. “Black market gold in Moscow now brings prices equivalent to $2 ,400 an ounce — close to four times more than current world rates, according to sources familiar with the trade. In othe r parts of the country, such as Soviet Central Asia, prices are reputed to be even higher.” 9 Soviet fiat money is the most rigidly controlled. Is the ruble inflating? “Inflation also hits the black market. One source said a five-ruble Czaris t gold coin that cost the equivalent of $100 on the bl ack market in the 1960s now goe s for close to $400. Even gold tooth fillings can b e unloaded at premium price s.” 10 "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 In other words, all the reasons f or counter-economic money in N orth America applies to darkest Russia. “Pe ople who have acquired money ille gitimately are understandably reluctant to put l arge sums in state-controlled banks for fear of unpleasant questions. Keeping huge s tores of money at home is a lso dangerous. Since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the national currency has been changed several times — with the ‘old money’ becoming worthless after e very reform.... “‘Anyone who doesn’t want to hav e to account for how he got his money might well tend to put his money into gold,’ said a Moscow writer who asked not to be identified. ‘That way, it’s alwa ys safe’... The black market offe rs no-questions- asked confidentiality.” 11 The collapse of Cambodia shows both the universality of gold an d its function of redeemer during economic collap se. “Despite a ban by Thailand o n cross-border trade, the river of gold that beg an flowing from Cambodia in 19 79 with the first wave of starving refugees continues, fueling a black market tha t distributes scarce goods across Vietnamese-run Cambodia and pumps millions of dollars into the Thai economy. ‘Business is better than ever,’ one Camb odia trader said of the unofficial ‘metals marke t’ operating at Nong Chan, one o f several unofficial refugee settlements straddling the border.” 12 The relationship between risk and profits — the basis of Counte r-Economics — is starkly visible from the rela tion between gold price and dis tance (to perceived danger). “At tiny stalls in Nong Chan and similar border camps, such goods as soap, flashlight batteries, pens, and rice sell for only slight ly more than they do at the nearby Thai market-town of Ar anyaprathet. As the goods trav el deeper into Cambodia, the prices rise accordingly, observers said.... “‘It’s a dangerous trip back ( into Cambodia) so these people wa nt a good rate of return,’ [one Western diplomat] said, adding that some of the g oods actually find their way to Vietnam.” 13 Perhaps the Counter-Economy has its own version of revenge. Earlier it was put forth that inflation is a good consciousness raiser — or counter- economizer. How about the monetary -collapse-caused black market of Thailand ? (We know the Cambodians are radicalized. ) "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 “Thai government efforts to stop the black market have angered Thai villagers, who say the trade is as active as ever but is reserved for the military. ‘If you go to the border to sell to the Cambodians and the soldiers take your things, sell them and pocket the money in front of you, how can you feel?’ one Th ai trader asked. ‘Before the black market, people liked the soldiers,’ he said. ‘Now 90% of the people fear and dislike them.’” 14 Even with all this gold, banks a re used. “...the diplomat said re cent daily fund transfers from Aranyaprathet to Bangkok at one Thai bank had ri sen from a pittance before 1979 to $500,000.” 15 One needs banks for two reasons: conveniently to handle large sums of wealth and to interface wi th the above- ground or white market. Actually, there are other ways of handling large wealth counter -economically. Drugs such as cocaine and gems are easy to smuggle and conceal. The interface with the rest of the market is fa r more valuable to most large- scale counter- economists. The rich ones simply bribe their way into seemingly legitimate banks. So what does the poorer and middl e-class counter-economist do? Convenient Gold Fences, money-changers, and other middlemen have dealt with the problem of “laundering” black money into wh ite. When money itself is the p roblem, one needs to keep most of one’s mone y black (in illegal or soon-to- be-illegal hard money). One can sit on contraba nd goods, taking the additional risk, and converting one’s assets when the time comes. Many survivalists find that fits nicely into their plans. Suppose you could deposit fiat m oney in what appears to be a ba nk. This counter-economic bank converts your deposit into gold and holds the deposit in gold, safe from government ravages. Got a bill to pay? Write ou t a “check” and the Counter-Economic Gold Bank (C-EGB henceforth) turns gold in to dollars at today’s price and sends along an ordinary bank check with your paperwork. Got"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 157 a counter-economic bill to pay? Wr ite out a gold check to your trading partner who can collect gold from the C-EGB or have it deposited to the ir gold account without going through dollars at all or having any external evi dence of transaction. Such a description is not only a full counter-economist’s dream but that of any part-time retreatist, survivalis t, gold bug, or even inflation- ravaged widows and orphans. It’s here already, at l east in ahead-of-its-time South ern California. The Counter-Economic Bank The Counter-Economic Gold Bank is an honest-to-God innovation. Many, if not all, of those designated “the w orld’s oldest profession” are co unter-economic, but C-EGB is really something new. T he rise of Information Counter- Economics has something to do with it, but to a large extent it owes its exis tence to greater understanding of economic theory combined with counter-economic action (see last three chapters). Banks — or even near-banks — are tricky to get going. Confidenc e and trust must be earned, painfully and sl owly. Since the consciousness i ncrease of 1972, several have tried and failed . One, however, has succeeded and after 16 years of continuous operation is now the f inancial center of several “fr ee-market businesses” including printers, typesetters, leather goods manu facturers, computer consultants, and several new businesses starting up at any time. We will return to this “Agorist Co mmunity” near the end of the cha pter and in more detail on its operation near the end of the book. This particular Counter-Economic G old Bank will be called A&Co. Because of the laws concerning bank charter ing (the government keeps tight rein on banks), A&Co. never calls itself a bank in its introductory literature but simply refers to itself as “A Free Market Business Trust” and operates openly bu t not obtrusively. A&Co’s main explanatory booklet of its operation has some euphe misms but straightforwardly calls the book Current Gold Accounts: A Free Market Money Instrument. After two pages of introductory economics of inflat ion, Current Gold Accounts gets right down to specifics. Money is defined in gram s of gold (one"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 158 troy ounce equals 31.10 grams). Up front, A&Co wants a contract signed with the account holder. The mechanics are simple and precise. “The deposit-payment exc hange rates for current gold accounts are: • currently determined once a day, when gold markets are open, at 1:45 P.M. When our volume permits, we’ll de termine the rates more often d uring each business day; • maintained at a l% spread and • based on the lowest premium gol d coin available, which someti mes produces deposit rates at a discount from gold bullion and payment rates at a premium over gold bullion. “Current gold accounts presently earn 1.0% pa [per annum], paya ble monthly, on balances between 100 grams Au (Au is the chemical symbol for go ld) and 400- gms Au; amounts over 400 gms-Au do not earn interest at this ti me.” A&Co explains they accept deposits in gold pieces, federal rese rve notes (dollars), postal money orders, a nd “dollar instruments (bank c hecks, money orders and so forth).” A of A&C o and others have personal check ing accounts (they explain freely) to deal with the instruments. Deposit slips are simple and one can either fill out gold direc tly in grams (if that is what is what is deposited) o r in dollars and A&Co will inser t the exchange rate, convert the dollars to gol d grams, and send you your rece ipt with the final figures. Gold may be deposited in any form . Gold will be paid out on dem and in Austrian 100 Corona coins (30.5 gm). Since it is difficult to get “small change” in gold, one of the obvious advantages of a C-EGB is to poorer people wh o can now “speculate” in gold by depositi ng it in an A&Co account in doll ars for conversion, and converting it back at a later price and time. A ny and all dollars are acceptable. "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 159 (In case it is not yet obvious, pap er money benefits the rich w ith government connections. Gold is the primar y defense of the powerless poor. Long-standing propaganda to the contrary is clearly self-serving to certain i nterests. It is strongly in the interests of the rich and powerful beneficiarie s of inflation to make gold difficult to obtain and transact.) By the eighth page of Current Gold Accounts we are half-way thr ough and the most complicated procedure is expl ained. The checks of the gold bank itself are called “transfer orders” and one m ay write one to another membe r of the bank to transfer either gold or dollars. The only complication is, as w as mentioned in the previous section, in transferri ng payment to the “outside marke t,” that is, interfacing. A&Co, quite reasonabl y to gain consumer interest, undertakes the effort involved. One sends A&Co the transfer order and bill and they send out an ordinary, regular-bank check with your paperwork. “When sending instructions to us to make payments from your gol d account, include: • an invoice, bill or some other form of explanation of the pay ment, • a transfer order for each payee with full instructions, such as name of payee, amount of payment and form of paym ent if different from commerc ial bank check and • an unsealed envelope stamped and addressed to payee. “If any of these items is missing, we’ll still process the paym ent but charge a reasonable fee for the extra handling.” What could be simpler? Examples are then given, including the g old-to-dollar calculations. A&Co points out that it may take them one to thre e days to handle the more complex transactions. It is next noted that accounts a re turned over once a month (usual for most banking type operations). "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 160 The remainder of this simple booklet gives examples of procedur es, sample calculations, and a list of benefits. One benefit is avoiding c apital gains penalties for those reporting income. Th is deserves a little more coverag e. If one has bought 20 grams of gold for $200 and later sells it for $400 to pay some debt, one could (if reporting it) end up paying taxes on the gain of $200 . But since the dollar declined to half its value in reality rather than gold d oubling its value, one actually preserved one’s wealth, nothing more. Yet one will sti ll be liable for taxes on this illusory capital gain. Although hard-core counter -economists would not report themselves to taxing powers, soft-core or grey-marke t counter- economists might wish to “cover themselves.” A& Co gives a servi ce, then, to these halfway people as well. Privacy is another benefit w ith obvious counter-economic implic ations. A&Co also mentions their minimal cha rges, paying interest in gold, a nd having a simple way to buy gold without the high premiums charged by coin deale rs for small purchases. Characteristically, the last benefit they mention is “support of the free market.” A regular newsletter issued by A&Co is the Free Market Advertis er, which publishes the gold/dollar excha nge rates they use over a month, publicizes associated counter-economic businesses, and publishes their rep orts to shareholders. A&Co also maintains a small stock exchange for th ese businesses. These people know what they are doing and why. E conomic and ide ological articles and editorials on the virtues of the pure free market and attacks on the immorality of State taxation and regulation abound. Their consc iousnesses have been raised. Problems of the Counter-Economic Bank Many will find it amazing that something as organized and sophi sticated as a bank (not to mention embryonic st ock exchange) can operate as i f in anarchy — with no government. The high probity of the principals of A&Co — non- smoking, non-drinking, and so on — certainly belies the black-m arket image, yet they do not discriminate against “looser” countereconomists. 16 As long as they"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 add their bills properly and pa y them, all are welcome. Needles s to say, the bank is a main source of investment capital for local counter-econom ists. A theme that should have been noticed already in this book is o f the relative impotence of government. Law-enfo rcement is helpless in even th e most totalitarian dictatorship when laws are not strongly accepted a nd enforced on people by themselves. Even when e veryone — including counter-ec onomists — agrees with the wrongfulness of a n act (such as murder or theft ), the State’s own statistics of apprehension hit a high of only about 20%. (That is, over 80% of true criminals in the worst crimes ge t away from the inefficient gov ernment apparatus.) One important factor in minimizing the risk of state interferen ce in one’s activities is the tacit or str onger support of everyone involve d. In the case of the Counter-Economic Gold Bank, it gives strong, continuous benefit s to those with whom it does business. This is at least as important as ideolog ical exhortations to remain loyal and the potential os tracism of one’s trading partn ers and customers, should one report the activities to the State. Perhaps the Stat e could offer a high enough reward to convince some to turn stool-pigeon but that ha s yet to happen after seven years and hundreds of people aware of the nature of the activities. And as this free market expands , the benefits involved in it gr ow, and the reward or bounty needs to get higher and higher until the State can no longer raise enough to crush a significant part at all. A particularly sensitive problem for Inflation Counter-Economic s, though common to all, is the flow and storage of information. Publicit y and advertising is good for business; regular financial disclosure builds trust , confidence and more business, yet the more info rmation about countereconomic a ctivity is disclosed, the greater the risk that even Keystone Kops will ac cidentally trip across it, realize what is going on, and act to stop it. Fortunately, at the same time tha t the counter-economy is getti ng more financially sophisticated, infor mation technology is experienci ng breakthroughs in storage and transmittal which are now completely free of unw anted intrusion. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 The next chapter looks at the rise of Information Counter-Econo mics. If Inflation is the Great Counter-Economizer, t hen the Information industry explosion is the new shining, white-knight def ender of the Counter-Economy. Barter Counter-Economics Bartering has become a recent fad and its motivation is largely tax avoidance and inflation evasion. A recent book actually claimed that openly t rading without money was the new “underground” or “subterranean” economy. The truth is almost the opposite. Reported bartering is taxed. M ost of the new, big, barter netw orks with computer accounting and high-profile adve rtising disclose their transact ions to the Internal Revenue Service or its equivalent in other countries. The IRS a ssigns a value to the goods exchanged and demands t axes on the income. Sales tax may or may not be collected in the various localities and so on. Even wher e taxation is avoided in part, the governments at the appropriate level can p ass new taxes on the transactions whenever they wish. There are other advantages to ope n bartering such as those for cash-poor companies but as we have seen a t least sketchily earlier in the chapter, the use of some form of money to mediate e xchange is highly profitable. It is no accident that businesses keep discovering that they have barter credits, yet can’t find what they need to purchase while ma ny goods offered go untaken. Counter-economic bartering has qu ite a different function. The current dollar (or gold or whatever) value of the goods are acknowledged by the tr ader and cash often changes hands surre ptitiously to make change. The Barter Book of 1979 spells out several straightforward rules for engaging in barter, all common-sense, but two i n particular are blatantly c ounter-economic: “They [barterers who are named] use direct exchange. They never get involved with third-party barter. They have heard of barter-credit syste ms and barter clubs, but they are not interested. If th e premium were on efficiency, they would use money. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 163 “They reap tax advantages. They do not record their loose, unst ructured, friendly wages.” 17 Without high taxation and ever-h igher inflation of paper money, the inconvenience and expense of aba ndoning the medium of exchange would quickly rule out bartering for most busy people. The 1981 “free -enterprise scare” of Ronald Reagan’s election and early administration — with peo ple anticipating (wrongly) a fall in taxes and in flation — caused barter exchang es to fail or suffer loss of customers. Vigorous, publicized IRS attacks on them qui ckly wiped them out. Counter-economic bartering goes on but as a better way becomes apparent (gold- banking convenience) it will make way. Still, even barter Counter-Econom ics would be immensely facilit ated and approach the finetuning convenience of money-use with the intro duction of computer nets. “Money is infor mation” has already become a clic hé. If everyone joined at least one computer net work which linked with all the others, it would, at least in theory, work as fast and conveniently as using money. And the rise of Information Counter-Economics may allow just that. Even in that ideal outcome, there would be no reason not to run the accounts in units of gold mass simply to include all the hold-outs and curm udgeons and those without computer hook-up or between such hook-ups. Preliminary negotiations have begun with A&Co to issue the firs t counter- economic credit card (a Bank Anar choCard ?). It is no coinciden ce that those offering the service are computer consultants and programmers. Footnotes 1. A recent book, How To Prosper In The Underground Economy by Larry Burkett with William Proctor (W illiam Morrow & Company 1982), c ompletely misses this point. There is nothing “underground” — or at least counter-"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 164 economic — about barter dealings when books are open to the Int ernal Revenue Service. 2. A lot of literature has recen tly been published on the natur e and history of money, from strident pamphlets to exact but opaque economic ana lyses. One of the most precise, easy, and enj oyable to read is still What Has Government Done To Our Money? by Dr. Murray N. R othbard, a former student of Lu dwig Von Mises and a rare economist not ser ving the interests of any gov ernment or would- be government. 3. As related to the author by Econ omist-Historian Professor Mu rray N. Rothbard, PhD. 4. Nobel-prize-winning Austrian economist Friedrich Von Hayek n ow suggests competing currencies be allowed and money “denationalized” by t he State. 5. Most Austrian-economic-based writing has explained the busin ess cycle in detail since the landmark publis hing of Von Mises’s doctoral th esis: Theory of Money And Credit (1910). It expl ained the Great Depression 19 y ears before it happened. Here’s a longer sketch for those who wish to avoid lo oking up references: Increasing the money supply gives the first recipie nts in line (government rulers, banks, contr actors with the government) mor e purchasing power. They bid up certain resources at the old prices and sign al the producers to produce more because the producers think they can make more mon ey. Eventually there is a general pr ice rise, people find they can afford much less with the same money and cut back on their spending. Over-invest ed businesses that had increased production now get signals to reduce output, and liquidation (“fire sales” to “going out o f business sales”) and layoffs occ ur. This unemployment and capital loss is called a depression (or recess ion or other euphemism such as “rolling readjustment”). It could end there b ut the panicking bankrupt businessmen and unemploye d laborers call for more mone y to solve the problem. The government obligingl y prints more. But, to trick t he market again into the first boom (or another like it), it has to print more than expected. (After all, everyone’s already seen the prices rising, assume they wil l continue to rise at the same rate, and discount the money accordingly.) Eventually, the people catch on that they will be tricked aga in and anticipate any hike. At that point, the money is spent as fast as it is received (what Mises called the “flight into real goods”), workers are paid two or three times a day, debts have to be refinanced daily or even hourly. Finally, pe ople throw away the worthless money to use foreign currencies, barter, and gold. This is the Crack-Up Boom ending runaway"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 165 inflation.

Consider the eleme ntary difference between a stre et deal with and without the watchful eyes of State agents. Or consider a ship d ocking, unloading its goods, accepting payment, and sailing off. In one case, the forms were filled out and the imports registered w ith the government; in the iden tical case physically — but not informationa lly — no papers were filed wit h the State and its agents remained unaware of its existence. At the stroke of information exchange, contraband was created a nd the crime of smuggling occ urred. Control of information is a ba ttle over the State’s very abilit y to function. If you could cut off all information flow to the government, it would be unable to act. Strangely, the United States government recently threw in the t owel over information-industry regulation . And yet conflict remains aroun d the fringes, especially over the powerful computer programming method known as public key cryptography. Should cryptography succeed, the l ong-awaited dream of workable anarchy has arrived. To understand the full impact, let us look at how the State works, or, rather, how it steals . Plunder Through The Ages In the beginning, the State was a gang of bandits, terrorizing the countryside. Taxation was simple; the horde seized anything that looked valu able, ate anything that looked edible, and raped anything that looked app ealing. To beat the barbarians, the smart peasant hid his gold, his daughters ( and sons), and his livestock. To discourage this cut-off of information, the horde often burned down the villages when they had taken all they could find. Where the plunderers settled dow n to become a proper government , they restrained their appetites and exacted tribute that left the pe asant with just enough to live on and grow another crop next year. Priests were bought to convince the producers that the State had divine approval. And by the Middle Ages the Lords settled for only the first night with the peasant bride (droit du seigneur).

But as the market grew more complex, som e business activity underreported its very existence. The informer is looke d on with greatest disdain and fear from the schoolyard to the prison yard. T he “stool pigeon” receives an a utomatic death sentence from violent gangs (themselves embryonic states); neve rtheless, informers are shunned by mora l, peaceful counter-economists. American society of the twentie th century is riddled with infor mers. Just to keep some perspective, anyone in the U SSR not an informer is being i nformed on. And even the informers are inf ormed on. One’s safest course is to discover one’s informer and then select their information carefully. The drug industry is riddled with DEA and local police informer s. Gun-runners run free until the BATF gets an informer in their midst. Politi cal dissidents often have more dues-paying members from the Federal Bureau of Invest igation than from committed members. The Fede ral Trade Commission depends on sore-loser competitors to denounce a compa ny for anti-trust violations. And above them all, with a netwo rk of spies, informers, disgrun tled competitors, vengeful spouses, spurned lovers , and straight-out bounty hunte rs, stands the Internal Revenue Service. No lega l agency of state enforcement excites the dread and fear as that of the IRS. The IRS is the raised sword and mailed fist of the State. While the rest of the State camouflages itself with the appearance of good works, att empts to cosmeticize the taxman inevita bly fall flat. A popular bumper s ticker says it all: “IRS: It Really Steals.” How Taxation Works... In the modern world, IRS agents cannot, much as they may wish, mount their sweat-soaked stallions, draw th eir morningstars and maces, and ride shrieking through the peaceful suburbs in search of wealth for the Direct or. Then again, they have an advantage over the ir spiritual ancestors of three millennia ago. "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 168 Their victims turn themselves in. Three thousand years of mystification pay off every April 15 in the U.S. (April 30 in Canada, various spring days in other countries). American citizens are asked to send in the very informa tion the State needs to know. The exact amount doesn’t matter; the deduc tions are window-dressing. The stark truth is that, without that volunteered information, the State would have no idea where the wealth is. It is no new observation that if everyone stopped sending in th eir 1040 forms the State would dry up and blow awa y. The counter-economic insight is that anyone can (and does) do it without waiting for everyone else. The tec hnique is to control the information flow about oneself; in particular, the information flow from you to the State. Visibility and Profile There is not just one way to use information to free one from S tate predation. There are three ways. Two of th em assume you are acting relativ ely alone, the third assumes the opposite. Most people are familiar with L ow-Profile tactic of being “invi sible” to the IRS and other government agencies . The rest of this chapter will fo cus on that method. What should not be forgotten are the other tactics, esp ecially as they have higher payoffs (and correspondingly greater risks). High-Profile Counter-Economics deals with a particular area of State coercion by calling attention to his or her victimization. The more noise, the better. The famed Chicago 8 used publicity to keep themselves out of prison for years — even after their convictions. Civil disobedients trust public pressure to keep them out of ja il or to minimize their penalties. Indeed, the State ’s enforcers are wary of crea ting martyrs. The very concept of martyr exhibits t he power of Information; what is a martyr but a corpse with a good story? "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 169 High-Profile Counter-Economists have higher risks because they are so easy to detect. They gain the advantage of additional information flow — from themselves to the rest of the ma rket. To the extent they succee d, they become inspirational. Actually, this author has proven that it is possible to pursue the advantages of both High Profile and low visib ility simultaneously. The trick was to create a third category: The CounterEconomic Community. One may pursue any degree of notoriety (or, to put it another w ay, freely advertise one’s services) within the community of fellow counte r-economists while not informing the State, its agents, and, of course, its informers. To do that, one needs to control the flow o f information about oneself. Information Flow Ever notice that after you order something by mail, or contribu te to a charity or politician, your mailbox is suddenl y flooded with associated so licitations? You have generated outward informa tion flow and were rewarded by an inward torrent. Information is the raw resource of a burgeoning industry, inclu ding data processing and much of computer p rogramming. Information theory is a hot academic field. This is such a f ast-changing business that the American government threw up its hands i n its attempt to regulate it. 1 Setting the discussion of higher technology to the side briefly , there are two obvious ways to escape the State’s notice: don’t exist; if you do exist, don’t tell anyone about it. (There is also th e agorist procedure: tell onl y fellow counter- economists who have as much to hide.) Some counter-economists go that far. They cut themselves off fr om contact with anyone who might get to know them , get and stay off all mailing lists, operate through cash and never use banks , and even avoid legal residenc es, living in trailers as nomads or on neglect ed land in caves or makeshift s tructures. "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 170 Briefly, in the 1960s, these early self-conscious counter-econo mists (protoagorists, one might call them), were organized enough to publish a newsletter, Vonulife. (Vonu, the y said, was invulnerability tow ard coercion, and that is what they sought.) They had some obvious problems with maintaining contact and have largely vanished today. But not before they had made rudi mentary attempts at solving th e problem of beating the State and remaining part of society. After all, the State and human society are natural enemies; it should be possible to use socie ty as an ally against the State. (Remember the social standing of snitches?) They called the concept of inter action with the rest of society (those not “vonu”) interfacing. This was brought up last chapter in our explanatio n of counter- economic banking, and that was one set of examples. One way to interface with the r est of the economy, especially t he White Market or Overground or Establishment Economy, is to create another id entity. Let this fictitious individual take the r isks; you can drop the identity when it appears to be near apprehension. There are some serious problems with The Paper Trip 2 approach. To put it simply, if the State’s agents a re closing in on this alter-ego, as long as you wear the guise they are closing in on you . Also, once you “shed the skin,” you lose everything that went w ith it: accounts, contacts, acquaintances, and prop erty stored under that name. I t is a smaller loss than arrest and possible imprisonment, but it is no solution. Multiple identities — if you can keep them straight — are an im provement. The answer is not to abandon secondary identities nor to depend upon them. The technique is best used as a back -up — anti-arrest insurance. An d using some sort of dummy company or identity is inescapable for counter-economi c real estate. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 171 This leads to the natural categorization of information flow in to a system of layers. With each layer, there a re appropriate counter-economic techniques, some long-standing and successful, others yet to be developed by bri ght young innovators. Inner-Layer Information Flow The innermost core of informati on about you is made up of you a nd your intimates. Some people need work on themselves — learning when to say what to whom. And selection of one’s s pouse and family on the basis of their discretion may appear a bit unromantic or biologically restrain ed. Fortunately, a long-standing tradition in many families of keeping sensitive i nformation “in the family” works in one’s favor here. The next layer is that between you and your friends and distant family. Notice how inquiries about income and business practices are considere d bad taste socially. Perhaps that is an indi cation of society’s natural ev olution toward agorism. The final inner layer may be the most risky: customers, clients , suppliers, and partners who not only know som ething specific about you but, if you get too close to them, they are in a position to have the “second two” to put two and two together. There are two useful techniques to control this information flo w; one is to follow the useful social rule against mixing business and pleasure. Th is must be done carefully so as not to excite suspicion that you’re hiding some thing — a tantalization that few can resist probing. This technique leads to putting your commercial associates in the next layer. But there is another technique: swap risks. If you have somethi ng on them, you are far less worried about them finding out something on you. T his is a form of swapping of intimacies, so, as in romantic relations, choose yo ur associates carefully. "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 172 “You mean you’re Counter-Economic, too?” may well be the most c ommon sigh of relief in the 1990s. Middle-Layer Information Flow Innermost of all commercial information are your records. Who, besides you, should see your books? If all goes well, no one should. Nor, with all the trust in the world, is there a good reason to give others so much access to your information flow t hat they are able to piece tog ether your books like a jigsaw puzzle (e.g., foren sic accounting). It is possibl e you may need to open your books concerning a sp ecific venture or one of your bu siness enterprises if you involve others in investment; this can be ha ndled counter- economically. Such enterprises are useful for distancing yourself from unfrie ndly information gatherers by adding an extra layer for their penetration. The middle layer (a mesosphere, the scientists would call it) o f information flow is the interesting part. Here is where your casual interactions with others lie. An obvious virtue or good habit to develop is never to reveal i nformation pertaining to your counter-econom ic activities, or — before you do — you consciously consider the conseque nces. “Talk to you tomorrow ab out that, Jane; I’ve got to check something first,” gives you 24 hours of risk- weighing. Still, if you are going to deal with the rest of the world, you must reveal some information: that you have a pr oduct or service, how much it wi ll cost, what you will accept in payment, how you can be contacted, and when are you or it available. If there are multipl e payments, credit arrangements, repeat business, and post-sale follow-up involved, still more information must f low from you. And toward you as well. Another good technique is the informati on swap. As you reveal something, you learn something from your supplier or customer. "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 173 If you discover your counterpart is also counter-economic, keep the relief somewhat contained. You still need to find out how counter-econ omic. After all, there are counter-economic cops a nd even IRS agents! Everyone b reaks laws some of the time; it is impossible not to. But that works for you more than against you. For if it’s not o bvious that your client or tradesman is counter- economic, you have to make the s tep yourself to cross the line. And since everyone is somewhat counter-economic , it is not obvious that you are suggesting anything out of the ordinary ex cept in this limited case. This is far easier than it sounds. Hundreds of times this autho r has gone to printers and suggested they don’t waste receipt papers and drop the sales tax. Refusal came only when the mista ke was made of talking to a non - decisionmaker. Beware even the smallest bureaucracy. Cabbies in New York will offer to leave the flag up if you don’t look too much like a la w enforcer — and if you ask first, jump at the offer. At least at present, North American society has pressured the g overnment court system to frown on entrapment. It will change, but while it’s i n effect, it is a great boon for Counter-Economists breaking the ice. 3 Personal contact has the advantage of allowing a counter-econom ic courtship rite. But there is a corresponding giveaway of information abou t you by allowing another’s observation. It’s a trade-off. As always in Counter-E conomics, you must weigh the risks against th e benefits in each particular si tuation. Consider, then, the benefits of impersonal contact from adverti sement and word of mouth, correspondence, deliver y via (possibly counter-econom ic) couriers, and payment by mail, courier, or even through counter-economic banks. At this point, it’s time to haul out the computer. Computers for Counter-Economics Consider the following scenario: Someone in the market for, say , custom footwear, consults a list of p roducts. Seeing the category of f ootwear, she calls up"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 174 a list of suppliers. One of them h appens to offer fancy work an d gives an access code. The code is activated. A list of offerings appears. She r equests something not quite o n this list, say, a pair of high deerskin boots with elvish runes stitched in, suit able for a fantasy convention or Society for Crea tive Anachronism gathering. A ske tch appears of such boots, with specification numbers and costs, depending on type of trim. The order is placed and a depos it agreed upon. The deposit is t ransferred via the countereconomic bank (or maybe to a mail drop). The boots are d elivered, found satisfactory, and the balance paid. Neither party to the transa ction has revealed herself to the other. Anyone familiar with today’s com puter technology knows that not only is all this feasible but already exists, in whole or in part, in most major cities and university towns. Imagine further that you can keep your records in books under a complicated code that would require more tr ouble than you’re worth to crack . And that you can advertise on the computer bu lletin board with similar codes and contact and be contacted through such codes. Again, the technology is available, or, as the hackers say, “on line” It’s a dream come true for Counter-Economists: a nightmare in the making for the IRS and the government’s regulators and controllers. The “key” is Public Key Cryptography. The National Security Age ncy (NSA, colloquially known as “The Puzzle Palace”) hates it and is work ing on cracking the systems and getting businesse s and bureaucracies to agree t o a standardized system they can easily crack. It should be kept in mind that cr yptography is a dynamic, evolving system. It is a non-violent form of an arms r ace where one side cracks the code and the othe r develops a new system to top the old one. Those considering using this s hould check the current literatur e and talk with computer-hip friends. (The usual problem is to keep them on a n arrow subject.) A popular source, available in most libraries, to keep you curr ent in public-key cryptography is Byte magazine. "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 175 You and your corres pondent(s) define a cryptosystem . The sender has an encryption key; the recipient has a decryption key. They are not identical. The normal message may be called plaintext and the encrypted form ciphertext . “Cryptographic keys are analogous to the house and car keys we carry in our daily lives and serve a similar purpose. In many modern systems , each key is a string of digits. For example, k eys defined by the Data Encrypt ion Standard of the National Bureau of Standard s consist of 64 binary digits, 5 6 of which are significant.” 4 How does it work? “To encrypt a m essage, a key and the message are somehow inserted into an encryptor, and the cryptogram that emerges is a jumble of characters that depends on both th e message and the key. To dec rypt the message, the correct key and the cryptogram are inserted into a decryptor, and the plaintext message emerges.” 5 This is quite simple with conve ntional coding. The keys are th e same, must be closely guarded, and you must visit your correspondent to excha nge keys. But using public keys, the problem o f meeting and secrecy is solved . “These keys... have remarkable , almost magical properties: • for each encryption key there is a decryption key, which is n ot the same as the encryption key • it is feasible to compute a pair of keys, consisting of an en cryption key and a corresponding decryption key • it is not feasible to compute t he decryption key from knowled ge of the encryption key.” 6 You and your correspondent, say , Mary, can counter-economically contact each other on a “public” bulletin board . Agreeing to exchange inform ation, you set up your encryption. “To set it up, y ou generate a pair of keys, an d send the encryption key to Mary by any convenient means. It need not be kept secret.

To allow you to send private messages to her, Mary must similarly create a pa ir of keys and send her encrypti on key to her.” 7 You may publicize your encryption key with no fear that anyone but you can decrypt the message. “Any two people with directory entries cou ld then communicate privately, even if they had no previous contact.” 8 Exactly what counter-economists want. A Touch of Tech and a Knapsack Before leaving this subject, let us touch briefly on the techno logy. One may look up the programming in the cited source and, in a world of adven turous hackers, no one should find great difficulty in getting a programmer to set up whatever one needs on one’s home system. What one requires from Information pyrotechnics and arcane-seem ing codes is a reasonable confidence and qualified respect. Unfortunately, man y whom I have witnessed coming across this field bounce from awe and feeling that the State is defeated to depression and resigna tion when they hear a particu lar system has been cracked. Let us try to immunize you against both. The awe arises from statistics like the one published about the Rivest-Shamir- Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem. The amount of time required to crac k the code is the factoring time; assuming your key length is 50, it could be factored in 3.9 hours at one computer operation pe r microsecond. But doubling t he key length to 100 digits kicks up the factoring time to 74 years and tripling it to 150 digits makes it one million years to factor! By the time we get to 250 digits, we’re exceeding the estimated lifespan of the universe. Small wonder NSA wants to standardize key length at 60 to 70 digits. A 77-digit key was recently ava ilable for $165 for the common z 80 system. “...message encryption and decryption take about one minute plus the necessary disk access time. The time needed to generate the encryption an d decryption keys ranges from 15 minutes to 4 hours.... The author of the system, C harles Merritt of PKS, Inc., has received estimates of the time needed to brea k the system ranging from three uninterrupted d ays on a Cray-1 to one year.” 9 "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 177 In fact, newer and faster computers than the Cray-1 are up or o n the way, but one can easily outpace them by incr easing the number of digits in t he RSA key. Still, one should be aware of the state of the art when playing this g ame. An alternate to the RSA, the Knapsack Scheme, seemed preferable because of faster encryption and decryption . The name comes from a mathema tical puzzle where if one knows the total weight of a knapsack and its conte nts, and the weights of the individual items that may be in the knapsack, on e deduces which items are packed inside. For a numerical code, the items are a collection of numbers and the knapsack is their sum. Martin Hellman of Stanford University and Ralph C. Merkle used the technique to devise a public-key cryptosystem in 1978. Merkle offered a r eward for anyone who could break the scheme and the game was afoot. “In 1982, Shamir made the first successful attack in the simple st form of the knapsack cryptosystem. He found th at certain information about superincreasing sequences is not well disguised by a modular multiplication tra pdoor. In addition, that information could be secured rapidly by solving a special kind of mathematics problem (finding a short vector in a lattice). Sham ir’s method became practical with the inventio n of an algorithm for solving this problem quickly. Soon after, using a sim ilar approach, Adleman broke an other form of the knapsack cryptosystems known as the Graham-Shamir knapsack.” 10 Shamir collected the $100 prize but Merkle offered another $100 0 to anyone breaking the more complex iterated knapsack. Ernest F. Brickell of the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerq ue, New Mexico, went after th e prize in the summer of 1984. In October, “Me rkle conceded that Brickell had won the prize and Brickell received his check.... Says Merkle ‘I think the brea king of iterated knapsacks is quite surprising a nd indicates a degree of insecur ity that had not been suspected at all.’” 11 Is it time for information counter-economists to panic? No, and this is why they need to maintain awareness of th e fast-changing field: “However , this doesn’t rule out the possibility that a secure knapsack cryptosystem ex ists. Brickell adds,"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 ‘What this says is that if you use one, you have to use somethi ng other than modular arithmetic for hiding it.’ ... Of course, cryptologists c an’t resist the challenge of coming up with a cryptosystem that circumvents the flaws pinpointed by Brickell’s decryption technique. At Crypto ‘84, R ivest and Benny Cho were ready with a new knap sack public-key cryptosystem base d on arithmetic in mathematical structures called ‘finite fields.’” 12 While computer cryptographers pla y the game of better mouse vs. better mousetrap, Adi Shamir raises the stakes and offers hope that a counter- economically invulnerable (within reason) cryptosystem may be d eveloped — or at least the cost of it can be rationally calculated. “‘The most intriguing question is whether you can develop proof techniques that will show the security of cryptosystems,’ says Shamir. ‘If you could do this, it would be the biggest breakthr ough in cryptograp hy because at la st you would be able to show that concrete cr yptosystems just will not be broke n in the future unless there is a certain amount of time.’” 13 As in all Counter-Economics, the risks need to be rationally ca lculated and the pay-off traded off against the potential profit. With computers and counter- economic programs, this can be accomplished simpler, easier, an d faster than ever. Add to this the potential o f inexpensive high security of records and message exchange, and one need not ask for miraculous invulnera bility to the State’s authorized robbers. But something like that miracle may be provided by the market a nyway, and fairly soon. Having moved info rmation successfully in the Count er-Economy, the next trick is to move physical objects as safely and efficientl y. Fortunately, as we see in the next chapter, the marke t has a very long history in successful shipping Counter-Economics, that is, Smuggling. Footnotes 1. But not entirely.

Lurid examples of cou nter-economic"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 trucking and how it was romantic ized by C&W music, movies and T V, and radio. Is this a model for spread ing other forms and kinds of C ounter- Economics? The rise of British CB use, completely illegal, is c overed. Moving People Counter-Economically New York Gypsy cabs triumph over the regulators. Also covered w ill be jitneys; “Grey Rabbit” buses; private ca r-pools that evolve into undergr ound busing and taxiing; “hippie” airlines — why it took off and why it failed; and even hitchhiking. Ocean Counter-Economics Small boat owners beat controls in various examples. Potential and actual usage of boats for counter-economic pur poses are also covered, such a s barges of marijuana along the Florida co ast. Smuggling is tied in, of cou rse. A bit of futurism will be added with a discussion of the Sea-Bed Treaty and counter- economic implications for Ocean-Bed mining, ranching in the sea s, and even ocean habitats. Air Counter-Economics Freddie Laker takes on regulations and the recent airline dereg ulations as examples of responses to airlines’ “bending” the rules — Counte r-Economics! There will be examples of plane use for drug smuggling, diamond smuggling, courier activity, nearly everything on both private planes and commercial air traffic. Space Counter-Economics OTRAG will kick off this chapter , the private space industry bo th aboveground and underground; movement in various popular space groups away from NASA and government monopoly of space. B oth actual and speculative c ases will be surveyed. Chapter Nine: Energy Counter-Economics First, energy sources will be sur veyed as to counter-economic a nd establishment use: tapping public lines, faking stocks, private sources kept and exploited. Survivalists and ecologists are moving together out of regulate d power grid for"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 con- verging reasons. Both high-tech and low-tech alternatives to the market will be covered. The sham of governme nt “incentives” for small-scale energy alternatives and solar will be e xposed as actually protecting m onopolistic power companies. This will lead into an explanation of history of gov ernment regulation and its causation of nearly all current pollution and energy wa ste. Some speculation will be added at the e nd to indicate how a powerful counter- economy (and weak state) would ha ndle pollution and conservatio n. This will tie- in with the Justice Counter-Economics chapter. Chapter Ten: Human Counter-Economics This chapter should eliminate a ny lingering doubts about Counte r-Economics being cold and heartless. Sections will cover Illegal Aliens , especially Mexican border, but also Asiatics, Canad ians, Australians, and European s; labor as a counter- economic good; Underground Railway slaves moved counter- economically, variants of it still in use; Refugees covers Counter-Economics of freeing people from greater tyranny but should they even bother leaving their existing Counter- Economy? What is a free country (a little more theory snuck in here)? Minority groups are covere d here first, how they survive in hostile societies, and the sub- societies they form, usually overwhelmi ngly counter- economic — a hint of possible co mmunities for hard-core counter -economists will be introduced here but devel oped near the end of the book. The Unwritten Chapters Chapter Eleven: Dissenters and Intellectual Counter- Economics This chapter should grab the acad emics and the more intellectua l critics. Under- ground political, religious, and academic activity and the mark eting of that dissent in North America, South America, Europe, the Third Worl d, and, of course, Eastern Europe, will be exemplified. Underground newspa pers and underground publishing. A separate section may be developed on education alternatives, the difference be tween public schools, private sc hools, and independent schools and then out-and-out underground schools wi ll be detailed. A little more theory can be safely spelled out here. Chapter Twelve: Sex Counter-Economics “Everybody’s doing it” will be the theme here, with statistics on violation of sex"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 laws; lists of those laws in va rious states and countries, and various attitudes will be given, too — nearly everythin g is illegal and nearly no one cares. Pornography Definitions vary and these will be noted. Business methods of d ealing with local codes will be spelled out. Classifi ed advertising in street-sol d sex newspapers in Southern California will be cited and exhibited as a model for other types of counter-economic business transac tion and advertising needs. Prostitution “World’s oldest profession” is c ounter-economic: women, men, ad olescents — everyone — and it’s admitted by authorities to be unstoppable e verywhere. Amusing anecdotes about bondage- and dominance-fantasizing poli ticians will be told for spice and to make a point. Where does one draw the line between cohabitation and prostitution w ill be asked and answered. Moral ity and ethics of the business will be discussed but it will lead into following chapters: Psychological self-awareness and freedom of expression leads di rectly to the next two chapters. Chapter Thirteen: Feminist Counter-Economics This will begin with a review of the sex laws of the previous c hapters but with a slant on sexual discrimination and how counter-economic activit y gets around the State. Home Birth Counter-Economics The Home Birth Movement, largely illegal in the 1980s, is cover ed in some detail — the Midwife as Counter-Economist. History of smuggling and contraband of birth control information fits in here. Equality of Counter-Economic Opportunity This can be considered general for all minority groups, but wom en are the largest and thus will be focused on: how the Counter-Economy is sex-bli nd, color-blind, and creed-blind; the segment further develops the theme of sub- societies embedded in society-a t-large. Aspect which will be developed is how minorities use the Counter-Economy to break out of ghettos, barrios, and m enial employment in North America and abroad. Gays will be covered he re and in"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 188 Chapter Twelve. The futility of the ERA and such laws will be s hown and give an opportunity for a little theoretical explanation. Chapter Fourteen: Justice Counter-Economics This chapter will, in some senses, tie in with nearly all the o ther chapters because it will answer the burning questi on in the readers’ minds: how can justice and contracts be maintained without government; in fact, with gover nment as an active enemy of both contract and justice? Failure of Government Justice Why the government cannot deliver protection or justice leads o ff this section. Lots of examples, mostly in mode rn-day America, will be cited. The “climate of fear” and the perennial “crime problem” of “law and order” as a political football will be exploded. Protection Business Why catching criminals is too late for most people’s good, thou gh the Counter- Economy will even provide that service. The technology of prote ction and defence will be handled in great detail right up to the latest devices and their market popularity, and even ones yet to be introduced, right up to science-fiction possibilities. Natural Law and Its Enforcement The concept of Natural Law is introduced. The spontaneous order of the market will be explained, heavily illustrated both in “straight” trans actions and counter- economic dealings. The stigma of “ finking” as a more general co ncept and is validity will be developed. Fina lly, the reader will be given c ounter-economic law enforcement and criminal a pprehension procedures. The “prot ection racket” is explicitly excluded but “loan sharking” will be dealt with a s more complex and deserving of some sympathy. Arbitration and Counter-Economics Arbitration is already big in the aboveground and cases like th e Johnny Carson- NBC contract dispute resolution will be cited, as well as stati stics from the American Arbitration Association . Beginning of a Libertarian Ar bitration"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 Association will be delineated , and tying it in with “blacklist s” and “white lists” will develop a working concept of Counter-Economic Justice. Chapter Fifteen: Psychology Counter-Economics The theme of this chapter is the reinforcement of psychological “good health”, that is, self-reliance and ta king responsibility, with objectiv e actions — which turn out to be counter-economic. Authoritarianism Research on this subject, especially as compiled by Dr. Sharon Presley, will be presented showing the links between obedience-conditioning and statism. Human Potential Movement All th e various aspects of the New Psy chology will be shown compatible with counte r-economic activity, and even co ngruent. Not only Presley, Thomas Szasz, and Na thaniel Branden, but even psy chologists not identified with libertarianism will be cited. How It Works Concrete cases, anonym ous, of course, will be summarized here f or illustrating counter-economic psychology. Mutual Reinforcement Going beyond individual self-reliance and self-acceptance, the concept of individuals working together c ounter-economically, developing t rust and honest in- terdependence, will finally b e developed (after popping up briefly all over the book). Beyond relationships and a ffinity groups, we come logica lly to the idea of an active sub-society and/or M ovement of Counter-Economists — a nd that brings us to Part II. Part Two Chapter Sixteen: Understanding Counter-Economics “Why am I so smart?” theme kicks off this chapter. “How come th e author understands all this when the rest of society has ‘caught on’ o nly in part, at best?” will tease the reader into finally diving into the theory. Answ ers: (1) There is a well-worked, proven theory that has done wonders in predicting human action and describing it in a scientific manner (this chapter) and (2) There is a strong"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 190 vested interest — the strongest i n all history — to confuse the issue and distort your information to save its privileges (next chapter). The val ue of understanding economics to immunize one from “c on games” will be stressed to pull the reader along. Praxeology: The Study of Human Action Fairly simple (non-academic) but still rigorous presentation of basic concepts of Austrian Economics such as subj ective value, marginal utility, time preference (originary rate of interest), regression (money’s origin), the capital pyramid of Eugen Böhm-Bawerk and the business cycle of Ludwig Von Mises. B oth everyday examples for reader ide ntification and counter-economi c examples will be used to maintain reader interest. Why Counter-Economics Works Kicking off with the distinction of profit from “rate of return ,” entrepreneurship is reintroduced and then applied to all aspects of daily life. (This ties in with the previous chapter — selfreliance, but now acceptance of risk is stressed.) The key to understanding and practicing Counter-Economics is now spelle d out: trade risk for profit. The whole experience of the book is linked to back this. How Counter-Economics Works A formula will be given, simple al gebra, which can be used for day-to-day business calculations, using readily available data, to calcula te risk taken to see if it is acceptable — maximum estimat ed risk, at that! A few cavea ts about embarking on a counte r-economic lifestyle and disclaimers that the author is “advocating lawbreaking” closes out this chapter. Chapter Seventeen: Opposing Counter-Economics The second answer to why Counter-Economics has not yet become the Economics is finally given here. The nature of the opposition w ill be spelled out. The Origin and Nature of The State History and sociology of the St ate will be sketched out here, q uickly bringing the reader to the present time with increased awareness. Establishment Economics Ruling cl asses — the king and his court intellectuals"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 — are explained to show why the science of economics is constan tly bent into fraud and con games by political “necessity.” The popular myths of the day will be listed with brief descriptions. Dead Ends Conservativism, liberalism, soc ialism, anarchism, varieties of libertarianism, pacifism, “dropping out” and re treatism will all be trotted out , defined, sketched, and refuted as means of achievi ng a free society — again, drawi ng heavily on the reader’s experience of the rest of the book to keep it short an d sweet — or quick and deadly. Once all the other options are eliminated, that wil l leave the final chapter: Chapter Eighteen: Social Counter-Economics The promised final chapter spe lling out the full integration of libertarian theory and counter-economic practice is presented. This section will e ventually be expanded to a full volume with a heavier, academic style and th e book will be promised to readers for a follow-up (a sort of Counter-Economics II for sequel lovers). The book will end with a veiled — to cover liabilities — exhortation to live one’s theories and fulfill one’s dreams. We could close with a description of the author’s ten years in the Counter-Economy to show he practi ced everything he preached (or leave it to a back-panel biography). Bibliography & Index Recommended reading for further interest in the various topics. An index is probably a good idea but would double the time on finishing the book. The Table of Contents could list sub-topics instead. NOTE TO PUBLISHERS: The fact that this subject touches almost every field, and hence will be in demand as a reference in History, Sociolog y, Economics, Feminism, Eastern Studies, Russian Studies, Psychology, and Pol itical Science, and is to date the only such work available, is not accidental but inherent in the nature of the subject. Thus, it h as the rare quality of being b oth popular and academic in appeal... and with a little luck, so will the sequel. — SEK3 "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 About Samuel Edward Konkin III Samuel Edward Konkin III was a va nguard movement theorist and h ard-core activist since the historic sp lit between libertarians and cons ervatives at the YAF convention in St. Louis, 1969. In the subsequent three and a ha lf decades, he served as editor and publisher of the longest-lived libertarian publication, beginning as Lais- sez-Faire! (1970), then as New Libertarian Notes (1971-75), New Libertarian Weekly (1975-77, the longest-running libertarian weekly), and New Libertarian (1978-1990). He wrote the seminal work on agorism, New Libertarian Manifesto , in 1980. He has coined the following terms and concepts, many of which have turned up in all libertarian publications: C ounter- Economics, agorism, minarchy, par tyarchy, anti-principles, Left Libertarianism, anarchozionism, “Browne-out,” r ed market, Kochtopus, and more. He has influenced the works of authors such as J. Neil Schulman ( Alongside Night ) and Victor Koman ( Kings of the High Frontier ), who both had their first professional fiction sales in the pages of his publications. Mr. Konkin serv ed as Executive Director of the Agorist Institute, an outreach organization pro mulgating the principles of agorism and counter-economics. He was a guest of honor at science-fiction conventions and libertarian gatherings and was a seasoned world traveler. Counter-Economics was intended to be his magnum opus, the distillation of all his work and research over 15 years of move ment activism. Sadly, of the 18 chapters outlin ed, only ten chapters were writ ten. Of those, only six were available at the time of publication. Mr. Konkin died February 23, 2004.
