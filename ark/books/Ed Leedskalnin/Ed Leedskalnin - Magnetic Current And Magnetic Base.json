MAGNETIC BASE Radio waves cannot be made without electricity, and electricity cannot be made without the North and South pole individual magnets. Electricity is made in two different ways. One way is by a generator, using the free circulating magnets that are circulating in and around the Earth, and the other way is to use the bound magnets that hold together the matter, especially Zinc. When Zinc is put in the acid in a battery, and the right connections are made, then the North pole individual magnets will come out of the battery’s positive terminal and South pole individual magnets will come out of the battery’s negative terminal, and they will come out as long as the Zinc lasts, and when the Zinc is gone the magnets will be gone too. Physicists tell that each atom which builds up the Zinc has thirty protons, and thirty electrons, but when the Zinc is taken into parts by the acid in a battery, then only the North and South pole individual magnets are coming out of the battery, and not a single proton or electron shows up. From this you can see that the physicists are basing their thoughts on non existing things. In fact all matter and everything everywhere is held together by the North and South pole individual magnets. The magnets are the base of everything. They are the cosmic force and they operate everything, including our body. If you want to know how the magnets contract the muscles, connect each end of a fresh terrapin muscle with each terminal of a battery, then you will see how the muscles are contracted. I have been watching while the acid takes in parts of the Zinc and many other things. Everything that is taken into parts by the acid, the fi rst thing I see is a very small bubble beginning to come out of the matter. When the fi rst bubble appears then the succeeding bubbles are coming out of the fi rst bubble and are running or coming out in a regular line one after another. When the fi rst bubble swells up then it contracts in the middle and cuts off the new bubble and then closes up the outgoing end and then swells up again and goes over and over again. Those bubbles that leave the fi rst bubble act like small magnets, and some appear to have magnet poles. Most of the bubbles join the other bubbles and some of the bubbles absorb many other bubbles before they themselves burst and disappear. When the Zinc is taken in parts by the acid then the magnets which hold together the Zinc go into the bubbles and when the bubbles burst then the magnets go into the air in the Earth’s general circulation, back where they came from in the fi rst place, but if the Zinc is in the battery then the magnets will go into the battery’s terminals."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" I only used three kinds of acids—hydrochloric, sulphuric and nitric, but used many kinds of matter to experiment with. For best results, different matter needs a different acid to dissolve it, but every kind of matter produces bubbles and each kind of bubble smells differently. This suggests a question. What causes us to smell, and then to go farther, what causes us to taste, feel, see and hear? You already know that the magnets can contract the muscles and smelling, tasting, feeling, seeing is only a step from contracting the muscles. All functions in our body are performed by North and South pole individual magnets. When we smell, the outside magnets come in contact with the inside magnets, and so we feel the sensation that they produce while they are passing by and through the nerve cord or tube, and the same thing happens with our other senses. Our eyes are like the broadcasting cameras. They send out magnets and receive back the images from the objects we see. Many of you have noticed if you are looking with a concentrated look at somebody’s back while the person doesn’t know it, the person is liable to get restless and look around. I have noticed sometimes I can chase the mosquito’s away from the wall by only giving a sharp look at them. ACID : What is acid and what gives acid the ability to take the other matter in parts? For instance Zinc, acid and the bubbles that are coming out of the Zinc are held together themselves by the same kind of North and South pole magnets, and why acid which is one kind of matter can take another kind of matter in parts. The acid atoms must have a smaller orbit and few magnets in it than the other matter it takes in parts. In that case the acid atoms can get closer, and in the other matter atom’s orbit, and peel off one magnet after another until the bigger atom matter is gone. The one who will fi nd out exactly how it is done will be a rea! scientist. Radio waves are not waves; they are North and South pole individual magnets which are coming out of a transformer of the secondary winding’s coil ends, one-half going up in the air and the other half in the ground in increasing and decreasing numbers. The numbers are regulated by the transmitting tube, and the speed by voltage. The increasing and decreasing magnet numbers cause the receiver’s antenna to generate a tiny current to start the amplifi cation to reproduce the original broadcast. The magnets are not running up to the ionosphere and down again, but are running horizontally until they are lost. Those magnets which go up to the ionosphere never come back as radio to the receiver, they only cause the ionosphere’s magnets to come back to Earth as radar waves. Magnets do not run in the way the radio wave drawings show. SOUND BASE All branches of science lack a sound base. Electrical engineers know how to make and manage electricity, but they do not know what electricity is, and how it runs in a wire. Without knowing it they have no sound base to stand on. Radio engineers cannot make radio waves without electricity, but electricity cannot be made without magnets, and so the magnets are the base of electricity. When chemists make electricity from Zinc with acid in a battery, then the North pole magnets are coming out of the positive terminal, and South pole magnets from the negative terminal. The same magnets can be used to build up some other matter, and whatever the matter is, the magnets are always the base of it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Physicists are using one-sided equipment to chase the non existing protons and electrons, but are neglecting the North and South pole magnets, which are the base of everything. Physiologists do not know that the North and South pole magnets are contracting the muscles for our body functions. Geologists do not know what gravitation is, and what causes earthquakes and mountains. Perpetual transformation is going on with this Earth all the time. When atoms burst in the middle if the Earth, the magnets are running out from the middle, and so cause gravitation by attracting the matter that is in front of them, and when many magnets have come out, then there will be contraction that will cause earthquakes and mountains. Astronomers do not know what causes seasons. All planets and the sun have magnet poles. The magnet poles are pulling and pushing the Earth in axis way. The Earth’s summer end is always a stronger magnet pole than the winter end, and that causes the Earth to slide axis way and make the seasons. Millions of people all over the world have been fooled, including myself, by wrong drawing in geography books, in showing how the Earth’s yearly path around the sun causes summer and winter. In fact the drawings are wrong. I was lucky. I made a rock telescope and a rock sundial and they defooled me. Now I know the right path the Earth follows. The scientists should come to the ROCK GATE, Homestead, Florida, and have a look at the new drawing, the telescope and the sundial, and see how they would affect science.
