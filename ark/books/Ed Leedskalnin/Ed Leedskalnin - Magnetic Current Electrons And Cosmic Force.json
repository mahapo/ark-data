Send no check Address to: please note no longer available Before my research work I knew nothing about electricity. The only thing I knew was that nobody knows what electricity is. So I thought I am going to fi nd out why they do not know. I thought that if electricity could be made and managed for over a hundred years, then the makers do not know what it is, there is something wrong about it. I found out that the researchers were misled by wrong instruction books, and by one-sided instruments. Voltmeters and ampere meters are one-sided. They only show what is called by instruction books, positive electricity, but never show negative electricity. Now you can see that one-half of the electricity escaped their notice. If the researchers had used the same kind of equipment I use to demonstrate what magnetic current is, they would have found out a long time ago what electricity is. The positive electricity is composed of streams of north pole individual magnets, and negative electricity is composed of streams of south pole individual magnets. They are running one stream of magnets against the other stream in whirling right hand twist, and with high speed. Protons and electrons--Are you sure they are not the north and south pole individual magnets. If we have anything we have to show that we have it. Show the base where it came from, and show how the thing functions. We can fi nd concentrated north and south pole individual magnets in the earth, in a metal. With the metal we can demonstrate that the free north and south pole individual magnets are circulating in the earth. In the North Hemisphere the south pole individual magnets are going up, and the north pole individual magnets are coming down. Those free circulating north and south individual magnets are the building material for the magnet metal we fi nd in the earth. This should show that the north and south pole individual magnets are the real atom builders, and not the protons and electrons. I think the north and south pole individual magnets are running in an orbit around a common core in an atom the same way as they run in an orbit around a common core in the perpetual motion holder that I made. The only difference is that an atom has a small orbit, but the perpetual motion holder has a big orbit. I have never seen an atom, but I think the atom drawings are wrong. They should be drawn to fi t the earth on account of the fact that the atom is a part of the earth. The earth has two magnet poles. This means that each pole has an equal pull and push to hold the earth together, and so each atom should be built as it could have two poles. In that case both forces that make magnet poles should run around a common core (the core could be a particle of sunlight). If one-half of the force that makes up the atom is in the core, and the other half of the force run around the core, then in that case the atom could not join the other atoms to make a metal that could hold two magnet poles. I believe that if some enterprising man would analyze the magnet metal which comes straight from the earth he would fi nd that the metal is not built up by protons and electrons, but by north and south pole individual magnets. I think anyone who excludes magnets and calculations about things that this earth contains, he is wrong. Those who want to know how North and South pole individual magnets contract the muscles. Connect each end of a fresh terrapin muscle with each terminal of a battery, then you will see how the muscles are contracted. This is for biologists. I can see chromosomes without a microscope. To see I close my eyes and then I open one eye just a little to look at the blue sky. Then I can see chains of beads fl oating in the liquid in my eye. Some chains of beads are longer than others. Most of the chains are folded over in irregular shapes and between several beads in a chain there is a bigger bead and sometimes there is one, two or more beads hanging outside the chain, and sometimes I can see one, two or more beads fl oating separately. Each bead's center is light, and the outside rim dark, If I open my eye a little more and look sharper, then I can see round shining things running in every direction in jumpy paths. Some leave shiny wave like a path before they disappear. Each shiny thing is many times smaller than each smallest bead. They are not crowded, they all use the same speed, but the speed is a little too fast for good observation. To see fi ner things yet I look in a gray cloud with the eye open until I see a darker spot. When the spot begins to boil in the middle, then I can see tiny multi-colored streaks running out of the middle. The scene lasts about a minute and when it is gone then nobody can know when the next scene will come around. Matter: Every form of existence, whether it be rock tree or animal, has a beginning and an end, but the three things that all matter is constructed from has no beginning and no end. They are the North and South poles individual magnets, and the neutral particles of matter. These three different things are the construction blocks of everything. To begin, a meteor rock falls in the sun, the sun dissolves the rock to the fi nal division of matter, the North and South pole individual magnets, and the sunlight then sends them out here. The vegetation absorbs some of the magnets and the sunlight, and then grows. We eat the vegetation products and build up our body, and then when we die and our body is cremated, the ashes can be made into a rock, and then the rock can be sent to the sun to be dissolved again. The North and South pole magnets can be detected while they are coming down from the sun by radio. The radio waves are made by the North and South pole magnets. They spread around the earth, and the North and South pole."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Magnets that are coming down from the sun are hitting the radio waves across, and so disturbing their paths. That is the reason why we cannot hear the radio as well in the day time as we do at night. At night time we only get those magnets that are coming down from other suns or stars, but in the day time we get them all. Today, yesterday's sunlight is neutral particles of matter. If you had been high up above the earth yesterday there would not have been as much light there as there was on the ground. There you would have seen stars the same as at night time down here. In the empty space between the stars there is not much light, so the stars can be seen. Sunlight is light when it passes through some obstruction like the air, by going through an empty space it is not much of a light. ELECTRONS Millions of people all over the world are being fooled by the non-existing electrons. Here is how the electrons came into existence. Thomson invented an imaginary baby and called it an electron. Rutherford adopted it and now the men with the long hair are nursing it. The electron has a brother and its name is proton, but it is heavy and lazy. It remains stationary in the middle, but the electron has to run around it. To the electrical engineers the positive electricity is everything, the negative electricity is nothing, but to the physicists the negative electricity is everything, and the positive electricity is nothing. Looking from a neutral standpoint they cancel each other, so we have no electricity, but we have something. If we do not know how to handle the thing that comes through a wire from a generator or a battery, we will get badly shocked. Read the booklet \"Magnetic Current\" then you will know what the thing is, and the way it runs through a wire. The invention of an electron came by a tricky method in using electricity in a vacuum tube. Normally whether it be a generator or a battery, the positive terminal will have to be connected to the negative terminal, but in the vacuum tube two batteries with different strength were used, the smaller battery was connected normally, but the larger battery's negative terminal was connected to the smaller battery's negative terminal, and the positive terminal was left alone. That connection gave the negative terminal a double dose of strength, and so it became hotter and could push more. It was called cathode and the positive terminal anode, and the electricity that passed from the cathode to the anode was called electrons. In case the inventor had used normally direct methods to fi nd out what the electricity was he would have found out that the positive and negative electricity is in equal strength, and are running positive electricity against the negative electricity. That can be seen by connecting each of two pieces of soft iron wire with each terminal of a car battery and then by putting together and pulling away each loose end of the soft iron wire. More sparks can be seen coming out of the positive terminal than from the negative terminal. This direct method is more reliable than the tricky method in the vacuum tube. The trouble with the physicists is they use indirect and ultra- indirect methods to come to their conclusions. If the inventor of electrons had a vacuum tube in which his electrons could run close to the top of the vacuum tube from the west side of the cathode to the east side of the anode and then would hang a vertically hanging magnet that is made from three-inch long hard steel fi shing wire, and then hang one magnet pole at one time right on top in the middle of his stream of electrons, then he would have seen the north pole magnet swinging north, and the south pole magnet swinging south. The same thing will happen if the magnets are held above any wire where the electricity is running through. Those two vertically hanging magnets prove that the electricity is composed of two different and equal forces. Another way to prove this is to connect a fl exible wire loop east end of the wire with positive battery's terminal, west end with negative terminal, raise the loop one inch above the fl oor. Put U shape magnet one inch from loop, north pole south side of the loop. The north pole magnet will pull in the loop. Put the south pole magnet in the same place. It will push the loop away. Put the south pole magnet north side of the loop, this time it will pull the loop in. Put the north pole magnet in the same place, it will push the loop away. This indicates that electricity the same as a magnet bar is composed of two equal forces, and each force is running one against the other in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"whirling right hand twist, but those forces in the wire have higher speed, and both forces are coming out across from the same wire. One of the forces is north pole magnets and the other is south pole magnets. They are the cosmic forces. Your electric motor is turned around on its axis by north and south pole magnets. Even you could not start your car without the north and south pole magnets. If electricity is made with north and south pole magnets and the electric motor is turned around on its axis by the north and south pole magnets as is the fact, then this will bring up a question, where then are those Thomson electrons. They are not around the electric motor. The plain answer is they are non-existing. Rays: When I reduce the material from which comes out the alpha, beta and gamma rays, so small when it is magnifi ed one hundred times and appearing the same size as an average salt crystal, then there is no more rays, but has fl ashes the same as when a connected wire end is tapped on the battery's terminal, but without the red sparks. Depending on the size sometimes, I have to wait fi ve minutes before I can see a fl ash. I think the fl ashes are caused by North and South pole magnets which are hitting and breaking the atom orbit, while the magnets are circulating in and around the earth. In the Northern Hemisphere, the North pole magnets are coming down, and the South pole magnets are going up. Wherever each kind of magnets are running in their way, they are hitting their own kind of magnets and are pushing them in the same direction. This can be demonstrated by a foot long magnetized hard steel fi shing wire which hangs on a fi ne thread horizontally, and level. All that will have to be done is to re-magnetize the wire by changing the magnet poles. Then the wire will lie in a slanting position, the South magnet pole will stay higher. By using a coil and micro-ampere meter it can be seen in which direction the magnets are running the most. When I break the orbit of the perpetual motion holder which I made, then I get a fl ash of light from it, but that fl ash of light is made by the North and South pole magnets, and so I think the atom is built up by the North and South pole magnets, and when the orbit is broken, then the fl ash is made and the magnets are liberated to go somewhere else. The natural path to the North pole magnets in the Northern Hemisphere is to go down, and the South pole magnets to go up. I think it would be a good idea if the physicists while testing radium on the photographic fi lm for alpha rays, would put the radium on top of the fi lm, and for beta rays the radium under the fi lm, and then watch the results, or go to the Southern Hemisphere and experiment in the some way as they are doing now, and then notice if there is an difference. The gamma rays must be the same as the sun light, but stronger because they are used very close to their source. We have North and South pole magnets, positive and negative electricity, protons, and electrons, positrons and mesons and alpha, beta and gamma rays. Now why such a confusion? Does nature really need so many things in the perpetual transformation of things, on building up the matter and again taking it into parts? I think all that nature needs is three things, the North and South pole magnets and the neutral particles. Each kind of those three things can act differently with different speed and different combinations, and so they can accomplish different results. I believe the prospective physicists fi rst should learn what magnets and electricity are, then they will have a sound base for their experiments and their calculations. COSMIC FORCE Here is additional information for those who read my advertisement in The Miami Daily News, February 3rd, 1946. The North and South pole individual magnets are the cosmic force. They are the building blocks of nature's perpetual transformation of matter, and they are so small that they can pass through everything. They pass through the earth from pole to pole, and around the earth. If the North and South pole individual magnets could not pass through a vacuum tube the same as the Thomsons electrons cannot, then they could not be the building blocks."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Thomson electrons are very small parts of matter which come out of the cathode while the cathode is burned up or consumed in the vacuum tube. Without the general circulation of the building blocks there would be no change. Everything would remain in the same way as it is now. The building blocks from a matter that go to pieces could not get in the general circulation for the new construction. I think the Radium and Uranium were built up inside the earth with high pressure, and heat, while the North and South pole individual magnets were circulating through the earth. During the time the Radium and Uranium were inside the earth they absorbed more of the individual North and South pole magnets than they normally could hold, and so now while they are on top of the earth they let the magnets go so they can become normal again. Gravitation must be caused by the matter in the middle of the earth, and more concentrated than Uranium. When Uranium atoms burst they release the North and South pole individual magnets that held the atom together, then the magnets scatter all around, but when the atoms burst in the middle of the earth, and many burst at the same time, they can only run from the middle to the outside. When the North and South pole magnets are running alongside each other and in the same direction, they have no attraction for the other kind. They only attract if they are running one kind against the other kind. When the magnets are running out of the middle of the earth, as soon as they meet an object they attract it, on account of the fact that in any object there is both kinds of magnets in it. It can be seen by rubbing hard rubber or glass until they get hot, then they will attract sand, iron fi lings, salt, and other things. To see how it functions, move a salt crystal a little, if it happens to get on a different magnet pole, then it will jump away. Another way is to rub hard rubber until it gets hot, then it will be a temporary magnet. The difference between the rubber magnet and the steel magnet is that the magnet in the rubber comes from the magnets that hold together the rubber, and both North and South poles are in the same side of the rubber and the magnet poles are small and there are many of them close together, but in the steel bar the attracting magnet is not the magnet that holds together the steel, but the surplus magnets the circulating magnet that was put in it. Attract the iron fi lings with the rubber magnet, then approach with the steel magnet. Change the poles, then you will see some of the fi lings jump away. This means the steel magnet changed the magnet poles in the iron fi lings, and so they jumped away."}]
