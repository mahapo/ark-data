FROM CLOAK TO ORACLE Since the 13 th century invention of eyeglasses by an anonymous inventor in Italy there has existed the radical idea (and heretical, by Dark Age Church standards, which is why the inventor kept his idea quiet), that the human body is improvable. No longer were humans subject to the flaws of the maker or the oppressive control of a corrupt priesthood. Humans were free to choose or select for themselves improvements to their body and to ‘polish the pearl’, so to speak. This was an inconvenient time to introduce such a heretical idea. The Church of Roma was hung-over from a horrific binge of killing during which as many as one million peaceful men, women and children who called themselves Cathars (“Pure Ones”) had been gruesomely exterminated in the first European holocaust or ethnic cleansing. Dwelling in the patch of paradise that stretches from Northern Spain across the southern provinces of France, they claimed to be direct descendents of the early Gnostic Christians, many of who it is claimed fled to southern France to escape the persecutions of Nero and Diocletian. Their aim was the promotion of the Pure Gnostic Gospel or Pure Word of Jesus. The Scripture provided no justification for a Pope, they claimed. And, they maintained that they possessed the true secret of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 2 Christianity, which had been passed to them by direct transmission from the Apostles through Jesus. The Cathars called their church AMOR (‘love’) and claimed they possessed a spiritual technology originally taught by Jesus. Their ‘heresy’ (meaning ‘choice’, ‘selection’) concerned their use of this technology to transform themselves into higher beings. Today, as I documented in my book Cloak of the Illuminati , 1 a convergence of technologies led by nanotechnology married to DNA is taking this ‘heresy’ to the next level and carrying us into a new age of Light. A major overhaul of the human body is not only conceivable; it is doable... and patentable. A thousand things that have doomed the fragile human body could change overnight. Nanotechnology focuses on the creation of materials at nearly an atomic level -- nanocomputers are small enough that several hundred of them could fit inside the space of the period at the end of this sentence. As I write these words on October 17, 2003 the Bush Administration requested $849 million of seed money to fund the United States’ Nanotechnology Initiative. A report attached to the budget touts ‘nano’ as the next industrial revolution. This is a mass understatement. This initiative is an invisible reckoning, a tsunami wave of change that shrinks technology almost to the vanishing point. It will make science fiction reality. According to the National Science Foundation, nanotechnology will be a $1 trillion industry by 2015. Every top government agency is involved in this"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 3 revolution. However, the Pentagon is the leading force in this endeavor. Nanotechnology is essential to winning the War on Terror, says the Office of Science and Technology (a war the Pentagon believes will last decades). Ambitious plans are in the works. Just before the US led rocking and lonely occupation of the cradle of civilization, came an announcement from MIT News of a revolutionary idea from the heads at the Pentagon and MIT’s newly baptized Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (ISN). Launched with an initial grant of $50 million from the Pentagon and another $40 million from industry ISN will use nanotechnology to create the super soldier of the future. The Pentagon and MIT plan to revolutionize the battle uniform worn by US forces by cloaking soldiers in a chameleon-like skin coated with smart nanotechnology materials that could help shield soldiers against bullets and chemical agents, and monitor their life support systems. Fibers could be used to carry fluids, emit signals, or change shape or color all in the same piece of clothing. MIT’s “coat of many colors” or miracle garment will have microbe-killing power and will even heal those who are wounded. Another component – the number one request of soldiers, says MIT – is that it will be lightweight and waterproof. Soldiers want to be amphibious. They plan on embedding “exo muscles” in this ‘fish skin’, giving the soldier Spider-Man-like strength. The"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 4 soldiers would also wear exo-boots that would build up a charge of energy so that, if needed, a vertical leap of 20 feet would be possible. An even more advanced suit made of a fabric as thin as a wet suit and strong as steel loaded with self- reconfigurable nanotechnology robots designed so that they can change their external shape without human intervention is possible with this technology. Linked to the eyes in the sky and directly wired to the Net, this e -soldier I call the MIT e- Man ( e = all ‘wired’ or computer-related technology) will be armed with the lethal power of newly developed electromagnetic weapons of focused mass destruction. (At the same time, reports the Village Voice , morning after pills are being developed to inhibit the effects of hardwired fear and ‘softening’ any possible remorse for the soldier’s actions.) The $170 million budget request for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in fiscal 2005 includes $120 million for exploring and developing technological breakthroughs “that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro/physical sciences” – that’s cyborg or MIT e -Man technology -- according to the agency’s budget request. This is only the beginning of the development of a fully programmable, remote-controlled super human warrior, a new ‘Master Race’. And one more thing, the MIT e -Man ( Mighty Man ) will be capable of manipulating light to render the soldier all but invisible. That’s right, the super cloak will have fleshy ‘scales’ so that, like water, the uniform would blend into or scale to whatever background might be giving the soldier a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 5 cloaking capability. Like the aliens portrayed in the movies Signs and Predator , the MIT e -Man will be a cloaked killing machine. This doped-up, e fire-spitting, bullet stopping, building jumpin’ Jack Flash of a super soldier -- the ‘MIT e Man’ -- gives new meaning to the term “dressed to kill.” He (and she) will appear within the space of the next two decades, says MIT. Not since Pallas-Athena, the Greek goddess of war and wisdom, donned her helmet of invisibility (also worn by Hermes), took up her Gorgon shield that turned men to stone and shook her spear of light has the world seen such a figure. Until this new Super Soldier (or Super Zombie) is presented to us in a carefully storyboarded campaign like the President-as-a-flight-suit-clad cowboy making a Top Gun landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier proclaiming Independence Day and victory over the aliens most will not appreciate the enormity of this development in human evolution. However, once this Trojan horse leaves its first nano-footprint on the soil of our bright Blue Apple, as it leaps over tall buildings, things will never be the same. The MIT e -Man project is part of an even larger government initiative. Coinciding with the announcement of the MIT e -Man came a draft government report saying we will alter human evolution, meaning the human body, within 20 years by combining what we know of the embryonic crafts of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive sciences – the four primary 21 st century Power Tools. 2 The building blocks of these Power Tools are bits, neurons, genes and atoms. With"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 6 these Power Tools we will create a new and improved human body, a new product of the human (r)evolution. The 405-page report sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and Commerce Department, Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance , calls for a broad-based research program to improve human performance leading to telepathy, machine- to-human communication, amplified personal sensory devices and enhanced intellectual capacity. It recommends heavily promoting the concept of the hive mind, the brave new e civilization. RETURN TO BABYLON Soon after reading the announcements of the US government’s pursuit of the MIT e -Man technology came reports of US soldiers entering the ancient gateway of Babylon. I kept thinking how the Pentagon’s quest for the coat of many colors uncannily parallels the ancient quest for the Cloak or skin of the Mighty Man by the ancient Sumerian king, Nimrod. NMRD, Ni-Meru-Rod or Nimrod when the vowels are added, was a second millennium B.C. Sumerian king who called himself “Mighty Man by the grace of Yahweh” and created an army of Mighty Men. According to the Bible, Nimrod claimed royal descent from the Anunnaki gods of Iraq. 3,4,5 They are the Shining Ones, the mysterious angels of the pre-flood civilization described in Genesis 6 the Hebrews called Watchers, who gave birth to the Sons of the Gods or Goddesses, the warring Nefilim giants also described in Genesis 6, “they"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 7 were the Mighty Men who are of Old, the People of the Shem (Renown, Highward).” Though they were around at the time of Adam, it appears that this race escaped the cataclysm that destroyed the first race of man who interbred with the Nefilim. Numerous researchers, led by Sitchin, claim these Mighty Ones possessed advanced technology, including military technology, which, says Sitchin, they employed in wars between gods and men. Nimrod’s title, “Mighty Man” was a title bestowed by Enlil (the Anunnaki Lord of the Command or Word) upon kings appointed by him. The means by which Nimrod became a “Mighty Man” is described in the Book of Jasher (the addendum to the Old Testament mentioned in the books of Joshua and Samuel but ‘lost’ or banned by the Church) and The Book of the Generations of Man , which says the skins that God made for Adam and his wife went to Enoch after their death, then to Methuselah, then to Noah (who survived the Flood), then Ham stole them and gave them to Cush (or Nimrod). 6 Sitchin asserts that the Anunnaki lord of technology E.A. or Enki manufactured the human body. 7 He also created the ‘skin’ transmitted to Nimrod who became strong when he put on the “magic” garments. Jasher 27:1-11 says that Esau , the brother of Jacob, kills Nimrod and takes Adam’s skins ( c. 1600 B.C). This skin or garment of Adam was said to be a garment of light that came from the celestial realms. The legends of the Jews assure us that putting on this cloak of light worked for Nimrod in a big way. He got tremendous results. It was by virtue of owning this garment that Nimrod was able to claim power to rule over the whole earth, and that he sat in his tower while men came and"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 8 worshipped him. This tower, built in Babylon, was called the Babel , the Gate to God, and was the symbol of a human revolt or rebellion, which led to building a fortified tower that reached into the heavens in the course of staging revenge against the Hebrew god Yahweh (the Sumerian god Enlil), lest he flood the world again. After Yahweh destroyed this tower and separated humanity by language, 8 the meaning of the word ‘babel’ was changed to ‘nonsense’, confusion’. The secrets of the gate and the cloak of the Mighty Man went underground. While some may dismiss the correlation between the modern MIT e -Man and the skin of the Mighty Man of the past as merely literary contrivance or coincidence, such a view does not take into account the way in which the archetypal symbols, dramas and figures of history are recycled, if not repeating. We accept that this happens in symbol-rich Hollywood when a classic movie is remade, but it happens in the ‘real’ world of human consciousness too, according to a theory of archetypes introduced by Swiss psychiatrist and Gnostic champion Dr. C.G. Jung. It is important that we recognize the appearance of these archetypes for their ancient prototypes can provide sure guidance. The power of archetypal myth is enormous. Whether they realize it or not the Pentagon, and those who control its activity, is on the leading edge of a profound development in human evolution that, if we’re not careful, will make gods out of mere humans. With this possibility in mind, in Cloak of the Illuminati , I ventured into the sea of memories, the mythological realm, and fished out additional examples of quests for ancient power skins or cloaks of the Illumined Ones."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 9 One of the more interesting parallels the skin of the MIT e- Man draws with ancient power cloaks concerns the Cloak or Pallium conferred upon Elisha by Elijah just before his departure to the heavens in a “whirlwind”, c. 800 B.C. 9 The 12 th century Winchester Psalter illustrates the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, while an angel waits, holding a cloak symbolizing Jesus’ ‘new life’ through baptism. The key to the Pallium is to know that it transferred or transmitted Elijah’s prophetic or oracular power to Elisha, who was appointed to replace Elijah as the leader of the prophets or oracles, and to complete the spiritual mission of"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 10 Elijah. 10 The illumination from the 12 th century Winchester Bible on the previous page illustrates the belief that this cloak or Robe of Glory was transmitted to Jesus. Webster’s says illuminati is a term for a newly baptized Christian initiate. 11 When Jesus dons the cloak of light provided by John he becomes an Illumined One. According to Christian tradition, Elijah later appeared as John the Baptist and, Christians believe, he will return as the herald of the Second Coming. Perhaps he’ll seek his cloak. The whirlwind is a key story element linking Elijah’s Pallium to the goddess Mari’s Pala garment. The word Pala , notes Sitchin, is the name given to the cloak of the illumined goddess Mari in Syria. 12 Pala means ‘miracle’, ‘wonderful’, ‘shining’, ‘magnificent’, ‘hidden’ 13 and ‘to vibrate’ and ‘to hurl’, according to 19 th century symbolist Major-General J.G.R. Forlong. 14 Mari wore the Pala garment along with her Shugurra helmet that Sitchin says ‘took her far into the universe’. 15 The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia connects the etymology of nepîlîm with this garment, claiming Nephilim comes from niphal and the verb pala , meaning “be extraordinary,” i.e., “extraordinary being.” This mysterious Cloak of Light is the magnificent miracle garment worn in modified form by the most extraordinary beings, the spiritual giants of their day, including Osiris, Enki, Mari, Nimrod, Enoch, Joseph (of the Coat of Many Colors), Aaron, Elijah, John the Baptist, Jesus, and others. Each of these figures displayed gigantic feats, many of which were associated with their clothing. They also were considered masters of the four divine forces"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 11 or elements of earth , air , fire and water . The general term for these figures was Oracle . According to E.A. Wallis Budge, a few of the many powers possessed by the cloak-clad Oracle include healing the sick, cloaking his companions in an “incorruptible” body, manipulation of matter, and predicting the future. 16 John Rossner, Ph. D. has claimed the Oracle practiced a “divine alchemy,” the goal of which was self- transformation and the transformation of humanity towards a divine state of being and to “become for a time as mighty as the original possessor of the power.” 17 The “apotheosized” or “divinized” human heroes, the Oracles, were described as “new beings”. They are the gods and goddesses of the four divine elements of earth, air, fire and water. It is synchronistic the way the four elements of the ancient world match up with the four Power Tools of 21 st century science – genes, bits, neurons and atoms. It’s as if the archetypal four divine forces of the ancients are being re-tooled or re-vealed in our New Age of Light. Archetypically speaking, these four Power Tools coincide with the four ‘books’ of magic assigned to the ‘Oracle of Oracles’, Thoth or Hermes (who also wore the cloak). We are told in the magical texts that ‘ These are the titles of the four books: 1. The old book; 2. The book to destroy men; 3. The great book; 4. The book to be as a God’. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 12 The four elemental types, symbolized by the Lion, Bull, Man and Eagle were given as symbols of the one God. In all lands, in all languages are found endless myths of the Sacred Four. These elements change over time depending upon the conceptions of the civilization. Always, they are best manipulated by the Oracle, who carries a message of love and reverence, and combines the elements to lead us into the Great Beyond (‘Hyperborea’). In ancient Egypt the rod of Ptah was the emblem of the four divine forces. It is called the TET, after the god Thoth, That or TET, the Moon god, who was the great Craftsman who made the Ark of Ptah or the Ship of the Gods. A four- tiered tower symbolized the TET. In the language of symbolism the four-tiered TET is equivalent to the four- armed or strutted cross + or Tree of Life upon which Jesus was crucified. As we will explore in detail later, in the ancient sacred sciences the Oracle was the master of a fifth force; the Quintessence , or the biblical Word that mediated the four divine forces. Plato symbolized this fifth force by the dodecahedron . In October 2003, Nature magazine published an article claiming the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron. God ‘painted’ with it at the time of creation, said Plato. The dodecahedron, I propose, is the logo of the God Head and the Oracle. It encodes the science of transmutation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 13 The secret teachings of the Gnostic mystery schools of all the ages have professed the same truth. In our inner core, in our spiritual essence we are soul-star stuff. We are divine, noble or true blue particle-rays of light, quantum ships asail in the Cosmic Ocean of Resonance, cast a drift like crystal flakes of snow in a ( dodecahedral-shaped ) snow globe after experiencing the Great Shake until appeared the globe of Earth sailing about in the Milky Way. Traveling as emissaries from the Source of creation our souls become bottled-up, clothed, or cloaked in a body or container intricately woven from coils of DNA that is essentially a complex and dense living energy pattern composed of the four ‘elements’: earth , air , fire and water . The soul enters a sleeping state in the body, as if it is walking around in a dream, just as in the children’s rhyme. ‘ Row, row, row the boat, Gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, Life is but a dream.’ The object of earth life, according to the Gnostic texts we will examine, is to achieve Gnosis, to wake up, discover the secrets of the fifth divine force, put on the Cloak and fill the shoes of the Oracle. Today, the four 21 st -century Power Tools will offer significant advantages and will have a profound impact on the spiritual life of Gnosis seekers. As Shimon Peres, former prime minister of Israel,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 14 observed, “That which has been achieved by the atomic bomb in the field of military strategy will be accomplished in the future by nanotechnology in the field of civil potential.” It will happen quickly. Toward this end, Australian nanotechnologist Josh Hall imagines a “magic living cloud” he calls “Utility Fog” composed of nano robots in the shape of dodecahedrons . 19 These ‘assemblers’ are capable, voila, of programmable construction of any desired atomically perfect product, given feedstock, energy, and instructions. It has a body about the size of a human cell and 12 arms sticking out in all directions. A bucketful of such robots might form a “robot crystal” by linking their arms up into a lattice structure. Now take a room, with people, furniture, and other objects in it - it’s still mostly empty air. Fill the air completely full of robots and it will fill the space with whatever one’s heart desires. Christianity has angels and the Holy Spirit that act in mysterious ways. Gnostic Christians assert that it was a lower order of angels who built their heaven upon the confines of matter, and that they molded it into a habitable world, and then created a race of beings to inhabit it. Nanotechnologists visualize billions of assemblers doing the same job. Critics say talk of such assemblers is hype and will not happen in the foreseeable future. In my opinion, these critics are taking the last gasps of breath from a rapidly disappearing world of controllable science."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 15 Here’s a short list of the powers one would have if living in the living nano fog. Creation : the ability to manifest or unmanifest objects on command. Levitation : the ability to cause objects to move in the air. Manipulation : the ability to move objects at a distance. Teleportation : the ability to beam from place to place. Alchemy : the ability to transmute any element into another, for instance water into wood. Like the NSF report on the future ‘MIT e-human’, Josh Hall’s nano-fog provides the makings of a figure whose enhanced attributes were acknowledged by the ancients and ascribed to the Oracles, highly evolved spiritual beings who wore the Pala or Miracle Cloak of the Mighty Ones and who knew the secrets of the four cosmic forces of creation, plus the fifth, could invoke these forces, duplicate their effects and predict the outcome. In addition, the Oracle could connect with the Source. It didn’t take long for eyeglasses to catch on. It likely will be the same with this new skin or Cloak of Light. The platform for the re-introduction of this being is the creation of a new human skin loaded with technology that transforms an ordinary human into a being of extraordinary military potential. Will this technology also be used to create a skin of light of the Oracle that transforms an ordinary human into a being of enhanced and magnificent spiritual potential as well? What will our world be like when millions of people wear this advanced technology and display superhuman capabilities?"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 16 We’ll begin with an over view of Gnostic teaching and an assessment of the Gnostic view of the Oracle. The goal of the Gnostic belief system is to obtain the light, illumination, self realization -- realization of self as soul, stripped of the body, emotions, and mind -- not an intellectual awareness, but the actual experience of self realization. The second goal is God realization, connection with the God Head. This encompasses All knowledge and is far beyond anything the mind can grasp and is impossible to describe. It can only be experienced. As we shall see, when the Gnostics put on the cloak of light they let go of their earthly attachments and attained Gnosis by activating an inner divine spark or scintilla called the Blue Stone, the Blue Light, the Blue Tone, the Blue Pearl or the Blue Apple. Our English word pearl is derived from Sanskrit, meaning “pure.” The Blue Apple, as it is called in the Languedoc region of southern France, home of the Cathars (‘the Pure ’), is seen in the inner eye. With a lot of practice it can be followed into higher states of consciousness. Gnosis states that many can travel (out of body) into the higher realms, but to reach the pure land of AMOR, the pure spiritual worlds beyond time, space, matter and energy (the four nuclear forces) one must go through such a deep zone of darkness that it is impossible to traverse unless one is guided by the Blue Light. It takes a Living Master, an Oracle, to link the student with the blue light and the inner sounds that lead the student to the higher states of awareness. One wonders how this Oracle will manifest in our New Age of Light."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 17 2. THE RETURN OF SOPHIA In December 1945, two peasants, Muhammed and Khalifah Ali were digging for fertilizer at the base of the Jabal al-Tarif cliff about 7 miles north-east of Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in the Nile River Valley. 1 They tethered their camels to a boulder, and came upon a buried red jar as they were digging around the base of the boulder. ! Muhammed Ali told scholar J.M.Robinson that at first he was afraid to break the jar -- the lid may have been sealed with bitumen, as a blackish substance is present on the lid - - for fear a jinn (‘spirit’) might be inside, but the thought that gold might be contained instead, he broke it with his mattock. ! Out flew particles of papyrus. ! Inside the sealed jar, which lay undisturbed for seventeen centuries, was a collection of thirteen codices containing over fifty texts, including a few Hermetic discourses and a copy of Plato’s Republic , originally written in Greek, and later translated into Coptic (Egyptian Christian). The collection of books also included among them The Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Truth , and belonged to the earliest “mainstream” Christians. Ali wrapped his books in his tunic and took them home, to his hovel in the hamlet of al-Qasr. ! The books, loose covers and loose pages were dumped in the straw, next to the oven. ! Thinking the books were worthless, or maybe"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 18 even unlucky to have, Ali’s widowed mother burned part of the books. Muhammed deposited the books with a local Coptic priest, Basiliyus Abd al-Masih. ! The priest’s wife had a brother, Raghib Andrawus, who went from village to village teaching English and history in the local Coptic (Egyptian Christian) church schools. ! He came to visit, and, on seeing one of the books, recognized it might be valuable and took it to Cairo. ! There he showed it to a Coptic physician interested in the Coptic language, George Sobhi, who called in the authorities from the Department of Antiquities. ! They seized the book, agreeing to pay Raghib a sum for the books. ! The book was deposited in the museum, according to the register, on October 4, 1946. Today all the Nag Hammadi codices are in the Coptic Museum in Cairo. (The first codex of the Nag Hammadi library found in 1945 was purchased and given to Dr. Carl G. Jung on his eightieth birthday in 1952. It is called the Codex Jung . It was later returned to Egypt, where it is kept in the Coptic Museum, Cairo, with the other volumes.) The full collection was finally published, after ugly scholarly turf wars, under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of the Arab Republic of Egypt in Conjunction with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization by Brill between 1972 and 1984 as the Facsimile Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices . The Christian world was stunned to learn that the ‘real’ or ‘pure’ Jesus presented in this library does not match the invented Jesus of modern Christian tradition. The Nag Hammadi texts represent the central secrets of Jesus’s Gnosticism , the Gnostic “Way not taken” by the assemblers and compilers of the Christian canon (“rule”) at"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 19 the Council of Nicea in 325 AD (which spawned the Nicean Creed and the concept of original sin). The goal of the secret teachings of Jesus was to rewire and liberate our consciousness so that we could see past the illusions of Earth life and connect with the God Head, the means by which is already hidden within us. According to Gnostic teaching, the purpose of mortal existence is to reclaim the skin of light, re-enter the gate of Eden and dwell in the Garden of Life. All else is death. Find that gate and we shall live forever in bliss. Concerning the Garden, the Gnostics taught that in the Garden stands the holy Tree of Life . High in its branches sings a bird. Listen for the voice of the bird, for when you are properly aligned with Heaven and Earth, she will tell you all things. This bird (usually a dove) is a symbol for Sophia, the Holy Spirit, or the Wisdom. When this Wisdom comes, she will lead one into all Truth. The reason why modern Christians may not have heard of this Way is because, like the Cathars who attempted to revive the pure teachings of Jesus in the 13 th century, its teachers were brutally murdered or driven into exile. Its books were condemned, destroyed or vanished from sight. Simply, appallingly, as a result of a cover-up of the actual teachings of Jesus begun more than seventeen hundred years ago the real Jesus is considered the greatest heretic to modern Christians. We must also recognize that today’s dictionaries and accepted translations of Greek words, and even thesauruses, also reflect the impostor Judaeo-Christian worldview, which is a product of that same council. As history shows, if the meanings of words (such as the word Christ) are changed a people can be conquered, enslaved."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 20 In order to more fully appreciate the Nag Hammadi texts a brief sketch of the historical backdrop in which they were buried is necessary. The first two centuries AD in Egypt was a time of revolt and insurrection against the corrupt Roman rule. The Romans ruthlessly persecuted the participants in the Jesus revolution (as did other so-called Christians). Within a hundred years of the death of Jesus Christianity had already separated into two broad divisions, represented on the one side by the followers of Peter, the orthodox Jew, and on the other side by the followers of Paul, the Gnostic “heretic” who was struck by a beam of light. In the second century the division grew even larger. The Christian Gnostics came into existence and now the division was between the Orthodox Church and the Gnostic Heresy . On one side stood knowledge on the other stood faith. In these power struggles Jesus was lost. The Christian Gnostics were the offshoots and products of the three great Gnostic Schools of that day, Schools which had been in existence for centuries, and which formed the basis of the original Christian synthesis of religious experience. The essential teaching of these Schools was this: because human beings are conscious beings, it was believed by Jesus and the Gnostic Christians that our destiny is to develop our superhuman spiritual abilities and to make contact with divine consciousness. In essence, our destiny is to make contact with the God Head (called the Pleroma) or God Consciousness. A massive effort was underway to harmonize, synthesize or"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 21 syncreticize (cross-link) the wisdom teachings and mythologies of the ancients and to formulate a procedure to put on the Cloak of Light (Mari’s Pala garment), a symbol of unfolding divinity and metamorphosis into a divine being. The first of these Schools, located in Alexandria, Egypt, the shining pearl of the Mediterranean, was one of those in which Jesus himself had studied during his residence in Egypt. 2 Mark was supposed to have brought the Gospel to Alexandria from AD 45 to 62. Just south of the city of Alexandria, perched high upon a lofty plateau overlooking the blue waters of Lake Mareotis, there had lived for centuries before the Christian era, a group of men and women devoted to esoteric study and meditation. They are considered both a branch of the Pythagorean Essenes and teachers of the influential Hindu-Buddhist Theravada school, then living in the Bible lands, and were known as the Therapeutae (“to heal”) or Jessians. They are the first group of Christian Gnostics. For Philo the therapeutae were the theoreticians and the Essenes the practitioners. Philo writes that the Essenes in Palestine and Syria were identical with the Magi in Persia and the gymnosophists (the wise men) in India. They are Oracles who could patch into the Consciousness of God (called the matrix today). New studies say that the Essenes, also called Kanobi , relied heavily on a cannabis extract to baptize and to heal. 3 The second great Gnostic School of the second century was located in the city of Ephesus in Syria. It concerned itself mainly with the comparative study of religion and philosophy.

In the preceding century Apollonius of Tyana, a prophet and miracle worker often compared with Jesus, had established his own esoteric School in this city, adding its strength to the exoteric work of the College. The great College of Ephesus was a focus of the universal secret doctrines. Apollonius was not the only charismatic miracle worker. He is considered one of several ‘divine men’ -- people who were considered to be patched into the God Head, and who sought to reform the religious practices of their age. They were called “oracle mongers” by the jealous established religious authorities. 4 Central to the religious belief of Greeks and Romans at the end of the second century, the reign of the Roman Philosopher Emperor Marcus Aurelius, was the idea that there was a special group of ‘divine men’ between the eternal gods and the ordinary mortals, people who combined philosophy and sacred science to cure ill persons, and who transmitted knowledge of how to become divine. One of the central tenets of this philosophical school was that there were three types of beings, mortals, gods and ‘beings in between’, who like Pythagoras, were called ‘philosophers’ (‘ lovers of Sophia ’) or what I will refer to as the Oracle. The concept of the miracle-working Oracle played an important role in the rise of Christianity. The first Christians were Jews who believed in the imminent appearance of a Messiah who was a mortal teacher and/or a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 23 military leader who could explain the Law of Moses correctly and restore Israel to pre-eminence. Many of these converts believed that Jesus had been some kind of ‘divine man’ or Oracle whose divine attributes transcended the Jewish messiah. It was from this School that spread much of the Gnostic teaching which drove the rulers of the orthodox Church to great acts of ugliness and evil in order to squelch it. The men who came out of this School were equipped with knowledge of the Oracle, and therefore were considered as deadly enemies by those who were attempting to cloak the consciousness of humanity with a politico-religious structure dependent on faith and led by political and military (false or ‘fascist’) messiahs. Such a Church, founded on power, had no use, except as war games fodder, for those who took personal responsibility for their spiritual advancement and who sought the true secrets of the Burning Bush (which center around some mysterious blue stones of enlightenment). In contrast to the Church formed in his name, Jesus had valued the acceptance of self-knowledge (second to the doctrine of Unconditional Love) as a means to promote responsibility for one’s own life, actions and thinking. Like the Buddha (‘the Awakened One’), Jesus opposed the priests, politicians and theologians who barred the way to true self-knowledge, to maintain their influence. In the Gospel of Thomas Jesus flatly says: “The Pharisees and the Scribes took the keys of knowledge and they hid them. Neither did they enter, nor did they allow those who wished to enter.

The third Gnostic group, also situated in Alexandria, which exerted a powerful influence upon budding Gnostic Christianity, was the sect known as the Ophites , or the People of the Serpent. We will look into this group in detail. Ophion was a divine serpent who lived in the Tree of Life in the primordial Garden, and who revealed the sacred Mysteries against the will of the jealous god. His symbol was the serpent’s egg or stone of many bright colors. 6 The etymology of the word shows Ops is power and dominion; Opulens is wealthy; Opus is work; (s)Ophia is wisdom; Optics “I see” is the serpent power; Optimum is the best; Open is the door. Their emblems reveal that Cathars adopted the Ophite serpent symbolism. The meaning of the symbol spit from the serpent (shown in the Cathar crosses on the next page) was threefold: it represented, first, Supreme Wisdom (Gnosis); second, those Perfected Men who are the embodiments of Power (the Oracle); third, the Christos- principle (or Particle) within each man himself: the divine Ego made One with Gnosis ( Light ). Wisdom. Power. Light. These are the goals of the Gnostic quest. The horn with three rays at the base of the cross is the symbol for the Three Light Rays that are found in Egyptian hieroglyphs.

The entire underlying theory of alchemy is that something must be developed within and secreted from the human body, which will enable the seeker to make oneself over into a golden one, a Shining One, an Oracle.

This force field acts upon the observer and puts him in a privileged position in relation to the universe. From this privileged position he has access to realities that space and time, matter and energy, normally conceal from us.

Oracles throughout the ages have been describing this Pillar as a way to stimulate and awaken the ‘G-Spot’ and the secret energy of the Goddess, hidden as it is like butter hidden in milk, in various luminous ways.

Twin spirals that ‘oppose’ one another, but are actually One, , also represent this concept of the combined masculine and feminine. Rubbed together, these two sticks create ‘fire’. Two spirals or two lines forming an X signify oneness. In Gnostic terms the twin spirals or serpents are called Aeons .

This ‘yoke’ connected them to Christ (a fact known by Leonardo da Vinci who painted an M between Jesus and Mary Magdalene in The Last Supper ).

Shortly after 300 B.C., a god who displayed this symbolism was created in Alexandria, Egypt from two existing Greek and Egyptian gods. His purpose was to symbolize the synthesis of the two cultures that the new Greek rulers of Egypt hoped would occur. The new god’s name was Sarapis . The name Sarapis, says Godfrey Higgins, comes from Soros , the name given by the Egyptians to a (s)tone coffin , and Apis or Opis , the name given to Osiris. 2 These two words combined result in Soro-Apis or Sara-Opis , ‘the tomb of the bull’ or ‘the tomb of the soul’. Among the other meanings suggested for the word Sarapis are: ‘The Soul of Osiris’ and ‘The Sacred Serpent’. Both meanings are descriptive of the Pillar of Osiris. There once stood a statue of Sarapis in the famed Sarapeum of Alexandria. The Sarapeum was regarded as one of the wonders of the ancient world.

What were these strange “mechanical contrivances?” They obviously functioned as an oracle. Could one of them have been the Pillar of Osiris that revealed the serpent-deity that ‘lived’ in the Pillar? I shall have more to say on this later. For now, let us continue our survey of the Ophite background of the Gnostic teaching. The Gnostic Fathers Basilides (c. 125 A.D.) and Valentinus (mid 2nd century) introduced the Ophite Milky Way and serpent symbolism into Christianity. Both took advantage of the magnificent libraries of Alexandria, the product of an affluent trading center of interchange of religious ideas and as the intellectual meeting point between Egyptian, Buddhist, Jewish and Greek thought. I’m of the opinion that they knew the secrets of the Pillar of Osiris. It is important to remember that Alexandria was home to another of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the Pharos (Pharaoh) Lighthouse of Alexandria. Ancient accounts such as those by Strabo and Pliny the Elder give us a brief description of this remarkable 40 story “tower” and the magnificent white marble cover.

It spawned the modern day lighthouse, the beacon for ships at sea. In contrast to other religions, Gnostic Christianity first appeared in Alexandria not as a religious sect or school but as an attitude accepted by enlightened pagans and Jews. These Gnostics viewed Jesus as a divine man, an Oracle, and as a target to be emulated. As shown on the next page, Jesus lifted the mouth of the serpent and showed the way to activate a cosmic potential within everyone through Gnosis. This knowledge was not written down, but rather, was passed orally and symbolically by the Oracle. The disciple obtained his knowledge through initiation into the Spiritual Mysteries.

This sacred science was a science of the soul. (The master alchemist Schwaller de Lubicz, one of the major thinkers of the twentieth century, helped bring this science to light in the 20 th century.) Interestingly, the Hebrew word nahash means ‘serpent’. A related word nephesh means ‘soul’. In this way the word-symbols serpent and soul are interchangeable. The Egyptian glyph , along with all of the serpent symbolism we have examined, can, therefore, symbolize the science of the soul.

Two less frequently occurring nouns are ‘ adderet and ‘ eder ’ . Strong’s says adderet may be “luxurious outer garment, mantle, cloak,” Genesis 25:25. Eder may refer to a “luxurious outer garment.” 5 A phonetically similar word addir means ‘serpent’ in Ireland. The Druids used this term to describe a wise man. Numerous authors, including Gordon Strachan, have shown the many important Druid connections in Jesus’ life and teaching. 6 A number of legends suggest that Jesus traveled to the British Isles with Joseph of Arimathea. The Druids have been shown by many authors to be teachers of Gnosis. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the title adder would have been applied to Jesus. Now we can understand, he is called so because he wore the adderet cloak or garment of light. In 140 AD Valentinus went to Rome in a doomed attempt to become Bishop of Rome and lead the Church along Gnostic lines. At the time his followers had been engaged in a life and death struggle with the Church of Rome, whose leaders were often obsessed with the possible threat Alexandria presented to their power. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon, France, who formulated early orthodox Catholic Church rules, and attacked Gnosticism as arch heresy met Valentinus’s effort with a fierce rebuttal."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 55 In addition to the reasons previously cited, the primary reason was because the Gnostics denied that Christ appeared in the flesh (instead Christ is a flash , tone or vibration embodied by Jesus) and they urged people to seek direct access to God unmediated by church or clergy and to become as God. Oracle is the term used throughout history for one who has direct access to God. Within two centuries the Gnostic books would be banned as “heretical”. The libraries of Alexandria would be burned before the fourth century. The only evidence of Gnostic Christianity’s existence was the denunciations by the Church, its enemy. That is, until the light reappeared when two peasants discovered the Nag Hammadi library by ‘accident’ in 1945, shortly after the sacrifice of millions of lives during the holocaust of WW II. The Gospel of Thomas , one of the Gnostic texts found preserved in the Nag Hammadi Library, and recorded by Jesus’ twin , Iudas or Judas Thomas, begins with the statement: ‘Whosoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death.’ Thomas gives these words of the living Jesus: Jesus said, ‘I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from the bubbling stream which I have measured out.... He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: I myself shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.’ He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am . I shall bcome he ."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 56 This is the essence of the Gnostic heresy. Simply, it says Jesus taught the secret of the serpent of Divine Force. When we drink from this Divine Force spit from his mouth , which, we know now, is the Milky Way, we become a Christ. This is why the Orthodox Church despises this gospel. It not only contains the actual words of the living Jesus that promises that anyone can become Christ, rather than the compiled and distilled words created by church, but also it suggests Jesus is the serpent of Eden. In the Gospel of Thomas Jesus says: I am the light that is over all things. I am all: All come forth from me, And all attained to me. Split the wood, And I am there, Lift a stone, And you will find me there . 8 As all Grail questers learn, the center of the Milky Way is the Grail.

Following this linguistic path we note that the Greek word for (s)tone is Cephas or Kephas . Kephas is from Ke- phalos , meaning head . The Knights Templar and alchemists referred to this keystone as the dead head and symbolized it by a (the Cathar serpent when viewed from the face or head on). Cephas is the original name for St. Peter (from petros , meaning ‘rock’), the Galilean fisherman who became Jesus’ chief disciple and the Head of the Catholic Church. By this interpretation, the Oracle Stone is the Head of the Church. To Gnostic Christians, Christ, not Peter, is the head of the Church. This was not a man, as the Church portrayed Peter. It was a teaching, a science , that transcended humankind. Lifting the head or stone enabled us to ‘split the wood’, or rather, spit the Wood . Like the stone, Jesus is using the wood as a symbol for something else. That something else is the Word, the sacred life force energy upon which the world is built. Professor Helmut Koester of Harvard University notes that though ultimately the alchemical Gospel of Thomas was condemned and destroyed by the evolving orthodox church , it may be as old or older than the four canonical"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 58 gospels preserved , and even have served as a source document to them . 9 Dr. Stephan Hoeller explains that these Gnostic Christians held a “conviction that direct, personal and absolute knowledge of the authentic truths of existence is accessible to human beings, and, moreover, that the attainment of such knowledge must always constitute the supreme achievement of human life.” 10 Comprehending the secrets of the Pillar of Osiris, I propose, enabled them to make this connection. No wonder Ireneaus attacked the Gnostics and classified their teachings as heretical: if people participated in such a religion, they would be in an orgasmic state of ecstacy and would be their own Saviors. They would have no need for his church and its demonization of the human body! Worse even yet, Irenaeus was particularly dismayed that many “foolish” (his word) women especially were attracted to the heretical teachings. Gnostics claimed to receive secret teaching from prophets named Mary Magdalene, Salome and Martha. Among them men and women were considered equal. One of the early Gnostic Gospels discovered at Nag Hammadi was the Gospel of Mary . By slamming the door in the face of women, the Church not only rejected the teaching of Jesus, whose intimate disciple was Mary Magdalene, but also set back social evolution by a couple thousand years. Interestingly, the Nag Hammadi has the following to say about Mary in the “Gospel of Philip”: The companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene.

The rest of (the disciples were offended by it). They said to him, “Why do you love her more than all of us?” The Savior answered and said to them, “Why do I not love you as (I love) her? The “Dialogue of the Savior” (another Gnostic gospel) not only includes Mary Magdalene as one of the three disciples chosen to receive special (secret) teachings but also uplifts her above the other two, Thomas and Matthew: “ she spoke as the woman who knew all .” Cross-checking Egyptian mythology, we discover an astonishing Egyptian description of ‘ the All’ . The side posts of Egyptian temple’s entrance doors are often ornamented with horizontal bands of bas-reliefs portraying the three symbols: Uas -- the tree branch, commonly called the ‘Key of the Nile’, TET or Djed (center) -- the Pillar of Osiris, and Ankh -- ‘life’.

THE REALITY OF THE RULERS The Soul, the soul speaks: Who cast me into the Tibil, the earth, Who cast me into the Tibil, the earth, who chained me in the wall?

The Soul in Its Coat of All Colors. From the Mandaean Ginza. Theodotus, a Gnostic teacher writing in Asia Minor between A.D. 140 and 160, explained that the sacred strength of Gnosis reveals “ who we were , what we have become , where we have been cast out of , where we are bound for , what we have been purified of , what generation and regeneration are .” Who are we? What have we become?

What have we been purified of? What is generation and regeneration? The central text of Christian Gnosticism (which, as we have seen, is a collection of ideas, not a religion) that answers these questions is the Hypostasis of the Archons (“Reality of the Rulers”) . 1 Written in the third century, this anonymous tract presented an esoteric interpretation of Genesis 1-6 (which chronicled the Hebrew version of the Sumerian creation myth of man by the Anunnaki) partially in the form of a revelatory conversation between an angel and a questioner (probably an Oracle). It recounts the Gnostic myth from the creation of a figure named Yaldabaoth (who created humanity) down to Noah and the flood and concludes with a prediction of the final advent of the savior, the destruction of demonic powers and the victory of the Gnostic children of light over the children of darkness. By extension it predicts a world in which everyone becomes an Oracle and experiences the ultimate love and knowledge. In other words, it predicts a period of Peace on Earth and a return of the golden camel arches of love . As the title suggests this work proclaims the reality of the Archonic rulers, an enslaving authority of lesser gods that rings the Earth and whom the Gnostics, the children of the (blue) light, believe they are in conflict with and must overcome in order to create Peace and return to the Source or God Head ."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 63 The main characters in the mythological drama presented in this remarkable text are the ‘blind’ ruler Samael , also called Yaldabaoth and Sakla (“fool”), who creates the Archons and with them a big mess; Sophia, who created Samael as her consort, who has to come down from heaven to outwit the rulers to clean up her own even bigger mess; the Serpent, the Instructor, the Oracle, who advises Adam and Eve to eat the (blue) fruit forbidden by the Archons; and Norea (‘light of E.A.’), the daughter of Eve, a pure (‘Cathar’) virgin who knows the secrets of the Oracle. Another Gnostic text included in the Nag Hammadi cache that relates in detail this soul vs. rulers drama is The Apocryphon of John , translated by Frederik Wisse. 2 These secret words that the resurrected Jesus taught to his disciple John also explains the God Head , the creation and fall story told in Genesis, as well as the means by which humanity could achieve salvation. As in the Hypostasis , Yahweh, the creator of Genesis, is portrayed as an anti- Divine being. According to this text, before the material world came into existence, there was the Light, described as a Trinity , . From this Light came a series of Em anations, various cosmic beings in male-female pairs called Aeons . The fall occurs when one of these Emanations, Sophia, decides to make a copy of herself (from thought) for her consort without her other male half, and without the approval of the Great Spirit. Consequently, she misfires and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 64 produces the lion-faced serpent creator-god Yaldabaoth . This is the twisted serpent of wisdom the Gnostics called Chnoubis (from the Egyptian kneph , the Father of Ptah). Another way of spelling Chnoubis is Kanobis (the name of the Essenes) and Knoubis or Cannabis . He is the canna (serpent, conduit) bis or buzz from anna , heaven.

On his chest he wears the lightning bolt of illumination, visibly manifest in the bodies of the enlightened."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 66 Another Nag Hammadi text, On the Origin of the World compares the birth of Chnoubis to an aborted fetus since there was no spirit (‘Divine Particle’) or other half in it. 3 Sophia was disturbed by her defective creation, her heir she thought an error. It rushed to her. She turned to it and blew into its face in the Abyss . Or, the A Buzz . Sophia’s breathing procedure is duplicated by Jesus in John 20:22 ...He (Jesus) breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (Sophia). The aborted creature is sent to rule over matter (below the heavens). From the Abyss the creature arose, ignorant of how he had come into being. (Among early peoples, says Harold Bayley, it is believed that Earth and Sky were once wedded, but that long ago something – in some cases a snake – cut them asunder.) 4 When Sophia saw him moving about in the depths of the waters (of the Abyss) she said to him, “ Child, pass through to here ,” whose equivalent is “ yalda baoth. ” According to On The Origin of the World , this poignant statement was the beginning of language and verbal communications between the gods, angels and mankind. At that moment, we can surmise, all symbols, the Language of the Gods, were downloaded to Yaldabaoth. This, I believe, is the symbol system of the Cathars. The result of this communication was the creation of humanity by Yaldabaoth. When the lion-headed serpent saw that it was only himself he concluded that he was alone in the universe. From matter he made himself an abode and"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 67 he called it heaven. And from matter he made a footstool, and he called it Earth. (These are the footprints in the sand we must fill .) He then created humanity to populate the Earth. It is important to remember that Yaldabaoth is ignorant of the Divine Particle of Sophia blown into his face. When he looked up at Sophia talking to him he did not see her face, rather he saw in the water the likeness of himself -- . And because of that voice, he called himself Yaldabaoth, Child, pass through to here . The heaven created by Yaldabaoth appears to be a version of the Abyss known as the Abtu , the abode of the four corners bordered by the lion, bull, man and eagle. This four-cornered cosmic water world (the Looking Glass I term Aquaria , the cosmic aquarium) matches the four- cornered Sea of Glass, the throne of Christ described in the Book of Revelation. The Abtu was the “mansion” of God whose four outer walls are made of stone, whose foundation is sand (silicon), its exterior jasper, is the crystal Christ’s court is composed of in the Book of Revelation. 5 As seen by John the Revelator, it is ‘full of eyes’’ ( stars , consciousness ). It is hidden, unknown, invisible, nothing save the solar disk sees it. 6 This is because it is a floating crystalline cube, a Sea of Glass, a cloaked container of life mirroring the blackness of space. Yaldabaoth is trapped in some sort of mirror world, cosmic aquarium or glass Pandora’s Box. In calling to him to pass through to here, Sophia (who, recall is Isis and"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 68 Athena) was trying to coax Yaldabaoth out of the aquarium and to return to the Pleroma. The Griffon atop the winged globe draws the Sea of Glass or the Ark of the Christos. In Ark of the Christos I described this Sea of Glass as a container and, based upon the latest science, as a wormhole or cosmic transportation device. 7 It functions as a babel or ‘gate’ to God. Interestingly, the Greek word for confusion (babel) is Gryphe ( grief ), which is the root of Gryphon or Griffon, a mythical creature that is a hybrid of the lion (Earth) and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 69 eagle (Sky) . 8 Jesus is called the Master-Griffon because as God and man he represents the union of the divine and the human. In fairy tales the Griffin, the Bird of Gold, figures prominently as a transporter through the golden gate or the conduit . 9 Herodotus regarded the Griffin as the guardian of god’s treasures, and on a higher plane, the way or door of salvation, the Sea of Glass. A description of Sky Man or Griffon-Gate Man in his cloak of linen is found in Daniel 10:4-7. The four Cosmic Forces that compose the Sea of Glass are represented by the Sphinx, the guardian of the hall of life that is a composite creature of the lion, bull, man and eagle. These are the four creatures seen by the Oracle Ezekiel and, I believe, symbolize the four Power Tools of the All. They symbolize the four elements of which Yaldabaoth is a master of transmutation. By rearranging these elements the transforms into the air we breathe, the landscape we see and the entire ecosystem of which we are a part. To paraphrase Jeremy Narby’s description of DNA (composed of the four biochemical elements or bases A,C,T,G arranged in 64 codons) it has transformed and multiplied itself into an incalculable number of species, while remaining exactly the same. 10 Arranged in three dimensions of height, depth, width (plus time) they form a cube . The four bases are paired on the DNA molecule, and in a very specific way: A always with T and G always with C. Connecting the base pairs are alternating sugar and phosphate units, forming a structure that resembles a"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 70 ladder. The ladder is actually three-dimensional, though; it takes the form of two strands twisted into a long spiral -- the famous “double helix.” How is it that this molecule consisting of only six basic components (four bases, a phosphate, and a sugar) can contain all the information required to make almost a million types of animals and nearly a half-million species of plants? The Gnostics have answered this for us. It is, in a manner of speaking, a language, a language of life. DNA is capable of speaking anything into existence. The DNA double helix and the Yin Yang symbol for the Androgyne. “The double helix represented as a pair of snakes. By turning the picture upside down, you can see that the molecule is completely symmetrical – each half of the double helix can serve as a template for the synthesis of its complementary half.” 11"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 71 The DNA comparison is apropos here as, next, recounts the On the Origin of the World , Yaldabaoth opened his mouth and he created an androgyne, a bisexual being (a combination of the feminine oval or egg and the masculine triangle) that combined the male and female. He cooed at his offspring and when his eyes opened, he looked at his father, and he said to him, “Eee!” Then his father called him Eee-a-o (E.A.O. or Yao). He created six more androgynes for a total of seven . As the lion, bull, man and eagle are symbolic of the four Cosmic Forces, these seven androgynes created by Yaldabaoth are symbolic of the seven sacred forces of: the seven heavens; the seven divine entities of Zoroastrianism; the seven-headed serpent that bit the Buddha while in the river of initiation; and the seven Anunnaki of Sumerian mythology. They are not yet “people,” human or otherwise. ! The Anunnaki sages or “gods” (variously numbered as 7, 50 and 900), in general, represent the seven “nether spheres” (or neter , Egyptian for ‘god’ spheres) and guardians of the seven “nodes,” “notes” or “gates” through which the “sun of God” passes into the netherworld or darkness (the world outside the Sea of Glass). ! (For more on the Anunnaki connection to the Sea of Glass, please see my book Ark of the Christos .) The seven-fold knowledge or wisdom is found in the seven liberal arts , the seven bodies of knowledge that liberate the mind and create a “liber or free man,” one who is not a slave. They were divided into the three-fold Trivium of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric, and the four-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 72 fold Quadrivium of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. These words mean, respectively, a three-way and a four-way crossroads , implying that these paths of knowledge are fundamentally interconnected. By studying the links and intersections among these disciplines, one learns to recognize analogies, patterns, correspondences, through which the archetypal ideas that underlie and unite the cosmos manifest themselves in the world of time and space. 12 Let us add to this list of ‘sevens’, as does Schwaller de Lubicz, the seven fundamental constants: e, charge of the electron; m , mass of the electron; M , mass of the proton; h , Planck’s constant; c , speed of light; g , constant of gravitation; and the constant constant. 13 They are the seven “stars” in the hand of Jesus in the Book of Revelation. The Mayans taught that the Milky Way gave us seven powers called k’ul . They are distributed in our bodies. 14 The Mayans mastered these sacred powers to become Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan. Kan or can is Mayan word for “serpent” and “four” and alludes to the highest esoteric knowledge of the Maya. 15 The Oracles of the mystery schools were taught that they could transform and expand their awareness through seven thresholds of consciousness or chakras . It is important to note that the chakras are considered an inner ladder to Heaven. This precisely matches the image used by traditional shamans to discuss the creation of life. The serpent, the rope, the vine, the ladder or stairway to heaven of celestial origin are interchangeable."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 73 The seven chakras of the ‘Ladder to Heaven’."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 74 Mircea Eliade has shown that these symbols are also the axis mundi , or axis of the world called MERU, and symbolized by the Pillar of Osiris, the cosmic G-Spot Stimulator. 16 According to Eliade, the Meru pillar gives access to the Otherworld and to shamanic knowledge, and a serpent or dragon often guards this passage (along with the Language of the Birds ). In Egypt this pillar-serpent combination was featured in the hieroglyph of Osiris . Lifting the serpent, i.e. mastering each of the four Cosmic Forces represents the way to pass through , dive , to here , to pass through the Sea of Glass and return to the land of Sophia. ENTER SOPHIA The Hypostasis of the Archons tells us that Yaldabaoth created 365 archonic angels to rule over the Earth and aid in the creation of man; man himself is fashioned after the perfect Father’s image (the four forces), who was mirrored on the water . This creation was lifeless for a long time. It did not buzz, humm or contain the ring of life. This is when Sophia decided she wanted to retrieve the Divine Particle, the power she had given to Yaladabaoth (a fact to which he was ignorant) when she blew (blue) in his face . She sends five lights to visit Yaladabaoth who advise"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 75 him that the power of the mother, the Divine Particle, should be awakened in man. And they said to Yaldabaoth ‘ blow into his face ’ something of your spirit and his body will arise . And Yaldabaoth blew into man’s face the spirit, and the power of his mother (which is the Divine Particle) , went out of his mouth and into the body of the man; whereupon the man becomes luminous by virtue of the Divine Particle. Now, the man is buzzing. In that moment the rest of the archons became jealous, because though they had a hand in creating man, his intelligence, vis-a-vis the Divine Particle, was greater than that of those who had made him. So commences a perpetual struggle between the forces of darkness and the force of light for the Divine Particles (Blue Apples) in man that continues to this very day. The Hypostasis of the Archons says the evil archons clothed man in a material body, a casket or tomb (a Saropis). They contrived to keep Adam and Eve, along with their Divine Particles -- and Sophia herself -- trapped in matter, enslaved forever in the wheel of reincarnation as tillers of the Garden of Eden. In this way humans provide food for the rulers (more on this subject momentarily). The Hypostasis also describes a veil that exists between the world above and the realms below. “And the shadow came into being beneath the veil; and that shadow became matter; and that shadow was projected apart.” With the application of the veil thus began a program of mind-body control-- or soul enslavement -- maintained by Yaldabaoth’s Archons (rulers) which involved keeping"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 76 mankind distracted by material problems and concerns, imprisoned by its own fear of death, of mortality, and ignorant of its true, divine nature. Hence the soul became “entangled in the darkness of matter,” confined to bodily identification, ruled by a Church and condemned to endless, repeated reincarnation (or reincarceration), without possibility of parole, of graduation to goldhood or godliness. The Gnostics believed that the soul on its way back to the Pleroma would have to pass through Yaldabaoth. To escape, said the Gnostics, we must awaken the Divine Particle that enables the child to pass through to here and return to Sophia in a realm called the Pleroma (‘fullness’). Along the way, Archons waiting at each of the seven heavens would also have to be passed. In order to pass these beings, the soul needed to give a password. The Egyptians held a similar view. In the designs shown her from Egypt and Europe, the little souls emerge jubilantly from the mouth of a Serpent (or worm hole).

Only those who possess this gnios (from the Hebrew IO, ‘wisdom’) or Gnosis or knowledge and have lived ascetic lives can put on the blue light robe of Krist and cross into hyperspace, the realm of light. 20 Here, an examination of Epinoia’s name is helpful. Without the vowels Epinoia is simply PN . Add an ‘a’ and we have Pan , meaning ‘bread’, ‘manna’, ‘dew’, ‘wisdom’. Words commencing with PN include pneuma (from German pnein , to breathe), meaning soul; spirit; the breath of life . In Christian theology pneuma is the Holy Spirit. Pneumatic means of or containing wind, air or gases : opposed to dense or solid . In philosophy or theology it is the doctrine of spiritual substances . I find it most synchronistic that the word Epinoia is so close to Epona , the Celtic Horse goddess or White Mare. The English Mare is the French mere , meaning Mother . In Latin mare means sea (a pun on see ). In ancient Egypt mer meant to love . 21 In French, AMOR means love, and is the name of the religion of the Cathars.

A person is transformed from homo sapien sapien to blue-blooded homo maximus , the Oracle, who radiates or rings of the force field described by Fulcanelli. This enabled one to rise or ascend from Earth. Dr. Charles Muses, a mathematician, philosopher and computer scientist, who died in 2000, claims in his 1985 book The Lion Path , that the Egyptians had developed a technology in which tones, lights, and an as-yet unidentified plant are used, to “open a rusty valve”, or trigger the production of large pulses of hormones similar to the ecdysone (ecdydsterone), produced by larval forms of insects, which allows the adult form to emerge. 22 In this way, they would allow the gestation or mutation of a non- molecular body – a new skin -- that would allow the survival of consciousness beyond physical death. Just as every chrysalis has embossed wings on it, wrote Muses, so too, does every mummy case have folded wings on it (as we will examine in the Abydos symbol later). Larva means ‘a ghost’ or ‘specter’. It is the earliest stage of insect development, after it is hatched and before it is changed into a chrysalis or pupa , the stage in between the larval and adult forms. These sacred tones (the Holy Grail) are used to allow us to shift through the veil of creation into the realm of pure unity of matter and energy. Traditional shamanic peoples around the world say the Blue Stone or Apple is actually how our soul travels to the inner realm and it is inside of a quantum egg or in an “ interphasic state of existence ” (able to jump through time and cross great distances or even to use this skill locally)."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 88 A preliminary stage between the human body and this non-molecular body was what I term the Cloak of the Illuminati, which is the Garment of the Oracle found in the example of the Pallium conferred upon or transmitted to Elisha by Elijah just before he rose into the heavens in a “whirlwind”, c. 800 B.C.

THE HYMN OF THE PEARL In a phenomenal Gnostic text the recovery of the Divine Particle (the Blue Apple) and the Cloak of Light is attributed to Jesus’ twin brother Judas ( I-udas ) Thomas. The Hymn of the Pearl (= HOP ) or The Hymn of Judas Thomas and the Apostle in the Country of the Indians , sometimes called The Robe of Glory , is a “spy” story. 1 It tells of Thomas’s mission to Egypt or Al-Khema, the ‘black’ or ‘hidden’ land of alchemy to retrieve the Pearl/Soul. It is his autobiographical reminiscence of his soul’s descent or entry into bodily incarnation and its eventual ascension from the body to the realm of peace. Thomas rises after he has acquired a garment as a reward for conquering the dragon of Egypt and stealing its Pearl. His story is a masculine version of Is-Tara’s descent into the underworld to rescue her son-lover Tammuz (Thomas). The texts relating to this journey describe in detail the seven objects, including the Pala Garment (“ruler’s garment”) and blue stones, that Is-Tara put on before the start of her voyage. 2 According to Bentley Layton’s commentary in The Gnostic Scriptures , Thomas’s putting on the supernatural garment (I call the Cloak of the Illuminati), is the beginning clue to unraveling the Gnostic mystery of salvation. 3 Beginning here and working backwards through the myth"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 92 the ancient reader, the Fool, would pick up the secrets of self-knowledge that led them to the Oracle and Fullness (Pleroma). For this reason, says Layton, HOP has been identified with a special type of material called the “Gnostic call” . 4 As we will see as we recount it in detail now, to understand this myth one would have needed familiarity with the material we have just explored. When Thomas was a little child he lived in the Kingdom of his Father’s House, and like Buddha, delighted in the wealth and splendor provided by his Father. Alas, this was not to last. His Parents sent him out from his Homeland on an arduous spy mission, with provisions for the journey... From the wealth of their treasuries they gave him a great but light cargo (or “burden” as in Matthew 11:30, “My yoke is easy but my burden is light”). The cargo, we are told in HOP , was gold from the high country (“the above”). They lifted or removed from pure Thomas the “jewel- studded garment shot with gold” ( ) -- the Robe of Glory or Cloak of Light (the Illumined Ones, the Illuminati) -- which in their love, says HOP , they had made for him. This ‘robe of yellow’ ( golden ?) was tailored to his size (“age”). Thomas’s parents made a covenant (arch) with him, and wrote it in his mind so that he would not forget it. And they said to Thomas, when he goes down into Egypt and brings up the One Pearl which lies in the middle of the sea, and which is encircled by the fiery and ravenous (or “swallowing”) dragon, he will put back on that jewel-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 93 studded Cloak of Glory, and will become the herald (or Oracle) for his parent’s Kingdom, along with his twin brother (Jesus). So Thomas left the East, and accompanied by two guides, made his way into the land of the Babylonians. In the notes to the HOP , Layton observes that “Babylon” is not the Mesopotamian city on the Euphrates. Rather, it refers to the Egyptian “Babylon,” a fortified city in the vicinity of the Great Pyramid. 5 The Egyptian Osiris or Meru pillar links the Egyptian and Babylonian Babylons. The design of the Tower of Babel was based upon the Su-Meru pillar, which Mongolian myth says was an antenna-like pillar that produced a ring of life that kept the immortals immortal. Significantly, tower rings of tour , meaning a circle or circuit, and a ring , or Oracle. Babel was supposed to have had seven rings (corresponding with the seven notes and the seven heavens). It may be equated with the Gaelic tor , meaning a conical hill or a castle called a nob or neb , meaning a crossing point. A drawing found at the temple of Anu, E.A.’s father, at Uruk depicts the “mighty APIN (“an object that plows through” or opens , but which resembles the nib of a pin or a pen ), perhaps a model for the Tower of Babel. Without the vowels, APIN is"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 94 PN, the same as the Gnostic beam or particle of the spiritual substance of the Oracle, Epinoia. This is the subject of Thomas’s quest. The three wise men, Thomas and his two guides, went straight to the dragon and settled down close by his inn until the dragon should sleep, so that he could take the Pearl from him. Thomas wore a disguise so that the locals would not suspect him of coming from Abroad to steal the Pearl. But the locals ingratiated themselves to him, and mixed him a drink with their cunning, so that he forgot that he was a King’s son, and served their king. And he forgot the Pearl for which his parents had sent him. Watching their son from above, Thomas’s parents convene the royal court. It is decided that he should not be left in Egypt. And they write Thomas a letter saying, “From thy Father, the King of kings, greetings.... Awake and arise out of thy sleep, and listen to the words of our letter. Remember that you are a King’s son. You have fallen under a servile yoke ( ). Remember your garment shot with gold. Remember the Pearl for which you were sent on the mission to Egypt. Thomas’s parents were additionally concerned about the demons of the Labyrinth, a famous and extremely intricate temple complex southwest of modern Cairo near Crocodilopolis, home of the Crocodile god Sobek. The Greek version of the HOP , says Layton, implies that the Pearl and its guardian “dragon” are in the Labyrinth. 6 Herodotus regarded the Labyrinth as far more incredible than the pyramids themselves, and as an eye witness, minutely described it."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 95 Herodotus says that he found therein 3,000 chambers; half subterranean and the other half above ground. He examined the upper chambers in detail. Into the underground ones, the keepers of the building would not let him go, for they contained the sepulchers of the kings who built the Labyrinth, and also those of the sacred crocodiles. He found the upper passages were filled with exquisitely carved figures. At the corner of the Labyrinth stands a pyramid forty fathoms high, with large figures engraved upon it, and it is entered by a vast subterranean passage. Thomas listened to the voice (the Oracle) of the letter from his parents. And, says HOP , what was written in the letter was also engraved upon his heart. And on that spot or dot (no doubt an oracle or place of communication with the deity), he remembered that he was a child of kings a ‘noble one’ (‘Ayran’, ‘Mighty One’, ‘Christ’). He also remembered the Pearl for which he had been sent on this spy mission and that he had to steal or ‘lift’ it from the Dragon or Serpent. Thomas subdued the Dragon by calling his Father’s name (A Tone, in the Language of the Birds). He lifted the Pearl, released himself from his earthly skin and began to make his way to the road leading home to his parents. Along the way, a female being (the ray of the Oracle Epinoia?) lifts him up. “So she got me up from sleep,” wrote Thomas, “giving as it were an oracle by (her) voice, with which she guided me to the light”. Buzzing with a feeling of familial love (AMOR) leading and drawing him on, Thomas passed by the Labyrinth, left Babylon and entered the Meson or intermediate realm."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 96 Upon arriving Thomas could not recall his jewel stud suit. But then, suddenly, in a “mirror, mirror on the wall moment”, he saw his garment reflected as in a mirror. He perceived it in his whole self as well and through it gained acquaintance with it he learned that he was made of the same material as the image in the mirror. Upon recognizing this he is given his garment of bright colors (a coat of many colors or Cloak of Light) as his reward. This garment was “embroidered with gold, precious stones, and pearls to give a suitable impression. It was clasped at the collar, and the image of the King of Kings was (woven) all through it; Stones of lapis lazuli had been agreeably fixed to the collar. And he saw, in turn, that impulses or motions of Gnosis were rippling through it called ef- ful- gence . The talking, blue stone encrusted Cloak spoke to Thomas. “It is I who belong to the one who is stronger than all human beings and for whose sake I was designed by the father himself...” Thomas reached out, took the cloak and put it on his body. Once he put it on he arose into the realm of Peace (Tula). THE BLUE PEARL Thomas was the name of the disciple who was sent to India. In the East the Pearl that Thomas snatched from the dragon and that made him an Oracle is called the Blue Pearl and is considered a physical manifestation of the soul. It is called the Seed of Buddha Nature. 7 The pearl being"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 97 spherical is regarded as a symbol of the Soul or Spirit lying encased within the human body. It is the actual form of the Self, our innermost reality, the form of God, which lives within us. Everyone can see, feel or experience the Blue Pearl. When kundalini energy (the God Force that ascends our inner Tree of Life) becomes active through mantra meditation and rises through the seven chakras many see a subtle blue dot appear and disappear on their mental screen during meditation. The blue dot is referred to as the Blue Pearl by Swami Muktananda and is referred to as the most significant of meditation experiences. 8 The scriptures describe this Blue Pearl as the divine light of Consciousness, which dwells within everyone. When the Blue Pearl expands, writes Swami Muktananda in Secret of the Siddhas , an extraordinary Blue Being manifests from the center of its center. 9 This being is called the Blue Lord ( Epinoia ?). A visualization of the Blue Being is considered to be the realization of the form of God. I call this Blue Being the Oracle, the part that connects or patches us in to the God Head. From our examination of the Gnostic texts we know the “Oracle” is within the divine core of every human. It is the job of the Oracle to awaken our awareness of the “immortal core” and our Divine Particle with its spiritual potential imprinted within.

The visualization of the Blue Being leads to complete knowledge. This effulgence fills the initiate (the fool ) full of gen , the Mayan word for Love. The Blue Being can be found at the center of all the world’s great esoteric traditions. The Hindu Lord Krishna (or Kristna) is blue. Vishnu (or Fish-Nu), because of his association with water, is depicted blue; therefore all his incarnations including Krishna, are shown as such. Sky is the reflection of Krishna’s bodily effulgence; therefore it is blue. In Hinduism, persons who have depth of character and the capacity to fight evil are depicted as blue skinned. The blue skinned people are considered a lost race. In One Hundred Thousand Years of Man’s Unknown History French author Robert Charreaux suggests that the inhabitants of Atlantis were blue skinned people. When they resettled after the cataclysm of Atlantis their skin tone paled. Today, the hills and hollows of eastern Kentucky ring with tales of the “blue people” who enjoy vibrant health well into old age. 11 The Ainu, an indigenous people living in Japan whose skin hue is often described as blue tell of being who came from space and created the Ainu.

Druidic High Priests, like the Jewish Head Priest, wore blue robes. Plato said the Head Priests of Atlantis wore “the most beautiful azure robes.” 12 Mary also wore a blue robe. She was ‘sky clad’. Bayley notes that the Celts and Maoris tattooed themselves in blue paint. The blue paint used for this purpose was called Woad , which probably came from Wodan , Wodan or Odin . Woad is also a pun on the Wood or the Word . Odin is easily exchanged with Otin , O-Atin or ATON. The expression blue blooded , and the meaning of the blue skin, I believe, originally symbolized the idea of having the wisdom of the Word, the Divine Blue Being, pulsing in one’s veins ( vines ). The closer one was to becoming the Blue Being the bluer one’s blood ran and the bluer one’s skin became. Bayley notes that the Greek for blue – bel Hue, beautiful hue – is glaukos ( gleaming, blue-ish green, silvery ). 13 Glaucodot (‘blue dot’) is a graying, tin-white mineral composed of arsenic, cobalt, iron and sulphur. It is hard to see since it reflects all light. Glaucodot comes from the Greek for “blue,” in reference to its use in the dark blue glass called smalt.

The pearl brings important illumination and guidance as an alchemical metaphor for this study. For alchemists the Blue Stone is not an external jewel. This pearl is inside the human body and may be the new ( gnu or knu ) substance called brain sand that modern scientists have discovered localized in the pineal gland – the third eye gland that secretes Serotonin, Melatonin, DMT, 5-meo-DMT and Pinoline, the last three of which are psychoactive. During the multiple cycles or stages of illumination of the Oracle, this sand gradually becomes purified, refined ! and eventually fuses into a single body (more later). Unlike other gems oysters, a living organism, produce pearls as the result of an injury. It usually begins forming around a grain of sand or an egg of some parasite that invaded the oyster. The oyster protects itself by layering the irritant with nacre -- mother-of-pearl -- until, out of pain and suffering, it forms an object of great beauty. The offending particle actually becomes a gem of great worth. So it is with us spiritually. “There was a time,” says Plato, “when we were not yet sunk into this ‘tomb’, which now we bear about with us and call it ‘body’, bound fast (to it) like an oyster (to its shell) . 16 According to the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 106 Gnostics, we are the products of a botched creation, an injury inflicted by Sophia. We can make a second comparison with our bodies. The pearl is first embedded in a mass of live but corruptible flesh, then separated and cleansed from its surroundings so that it can appear in its purity and beauty. So it is with our Cloak of Light or light body. It is deeply cloaked in a mystery and must be unveiled before it can return home. As long as the pearl (the light body) remains cloaked in the oyster (the flesh) it is of no value. The production of the pearl is a gradual, even tedious, process. Slowly, the oyster adds layer after thin layer of nacre until the iridescent pearl is transformed. So it is with the human body. As mentioned in the introduction, since the 13 th century a movement has been afoot to add a new layer of technology (a ‘new iridescent skin’) to the body to manifest personal miracles and to free us from our flaws or injuries. Drawing the comparisons further, we know the ah-oy- ster is a ship at home in the depths of the ocean, a scavenger living off the garbage that sinks to the bottom of the sea. Revelation 13:1 shows the beast (the Pearl) rising out of a sea: “Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name.” The Beast is the grain of sand that becomes a (blue) Pearl. The Sea is the Sea of Glass, the cosmic aquarium created by Yaldabaoth and described as the Throne of Christ in Revelation. The seven heads that enable us to grow our horns (rays) are the seven-fold sciences."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 107 We are challenged to remove the pearl within us from the Sea of Glass, just as the oyster must be lifted from the mush of the sea bottom. After the awakening of the Blue Pearl or Stone one is ‘Type II Illuminati’, i.e. capable of building a bridge (or Ark) of blue light between Heaven and Earth, matter and mind. Like Jung, John Rossner, Ph. D. has claimed awakening the Pearl included a “divine alchemy,” the goal of which was self-transformation and the transformation of humanity towards a divine state of being and to “become for a time as mighty as the original possessor of the power.” 17 The “apotheosized” or “divinized” human heroes, the Oracles, were described as “new beings”. 18 As described by Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, here’s a list of earthly feats the Oracle is capable of performing: Healing the sick. Returning the dead to life. “Clothing” or “cloaking” his followers in an “incorruptible body,” a light body, as did Jesus. Weather control. Manipulation of matter. Predicting the future.

Today, we call exotic matter monoatomic elements . The ancients called it manna . The works of Laurence Gardner have made it amazingly clear that modern science has rediscovered the ancient science manna as an exotic matter that can open holes in space through which, one day, humans will be able to pass through to other realms. 20 I find it remarkably intriguing to compare the ancient gateway stories to the modern theories of stargates and wormholes. For instance, the Book of Numbers (13), another “spy story”, tells us Joshua, son of Nun (= Fish) stole these Blue Stones, symbolized by a cluster of enormously heavy grapes, from E.A.’s tribe of gods, the Anunnaki (‘those who came from heaven’), at the valley of Eschol and returned them to Moses along with a warning, “the land there eateth the people up”. I have interpreted this cryptic phrase as meaning the gods were operating a gateway, an Oracle center that caused people to vanish through a of light, similar to the orb in which the Terminator time travels in the movie Terminator 3 .

This is strange considering they possibly represent the core secrets of the universe. In fact, the cluster of grapes became a cryptogram for the Church itself. These Blue Stones are believed to be sapphire crystals containing cosmic secrets ‘etched by the hand of God’. Talmudic-Mishraic sources say they were transparent, flexible, blue and like the grapes of Eschol were very heavy. Later, I will connect these Blue Stones with the Urim and Thummim stones worn on the breastplate of Moses’s brother, Aaron, the Hebrew Oracle. It is the jewel greatly coveted by kings. Graham Hancock mentions these ‘stones’ in The Sign and the Seal , speculating that Moses knew they were hidden on Mount Sinai and that they are meteorites possessing a supernatural power source. 21 Further, he suggests they are a cipher for the Holy Grail. The word sapphire used to describe these stones may be a mistranslation of sappur , ‘holy blood’, says Robert Graves. 22 Ezekiel mentions it as the color of the Throne of God. 23 True Blue. As portrayed in the depiction of Joshua and Caleb delivering the grapes stolen from the Promised Land to the Crucifixion from the Castle of Valere in Sion, Switzerland, on the previous page, Gnostic Christian tradition maintains the Blue Stones (or their secrets) were present at the Gul- Gotha, the place of the Skull or Head, where Jesus crafted the Holy Blood and the Holy Water within his body during the Crucifixion.

Mark (12:6) says that God was the man who planted the vine and who asked his son to visit his vineyard. The followers of John the Baptist, the Mandaeans , used the word ‘vine’ not only to denote the Heaven-sent One, but also a whole series of beings from the upper world of light. 26 This may even include Epinoia . Following the horse pun enfolded in her name we find a correlation between the words wine and winne or whine the sound made by nag or horse. THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE The forgoing prepares us to interpret one of the greatest parables of Jesus the Pearl of Great Price, which serves as a parable of the kingdom of God. ! This parable is unique to the Gospel of Matthew, although a version of the story occurs in the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas . ! The Pearl of Great Price predates Matthew; it was perhaps an original composition by Jesus. “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly ! pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. ” 27"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 113 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.” 28 ! The Pearl of Great Price is often presented as a twin to The Treasure in the Field of Matthew 13:44 inasmuch as both relate the kingdom ( Plane? ) of God (also described as a Sea of Glass, a Net or the Matrix ) to a discovered treasure; however, the emphasis of the two differs. ! Whereas the parable of the Treasure in the Field focuses on the joyous surprise of finding the kingdom, the parable of the Pearl of Great Price discusses a situation in which the kingdom is purposefully sought by a merchant. ! In this parable the merchant “anticipates the element of surprise” in that he intently seeks out the pearl and the value held therein. The word “merchant” has had an interesting evolution. It originally meant a passenger on a ship, a merchant marine, but gradually became applied to the wholesale dealer as distinguished from a retailer. In the Nag Hammadi text, The Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles , the traveling apostles sail to a land where they meet a cloaked physician who reveals himself to be Jesus. 29 Jesus gives the apostles an unguent ( anointing ) box and a pouch full of medicine with instructions to go heal. Prior to giving them the pouch, Jesus announces to all in the streets, “Pearls! Pearls!” Seeing no evidence that Jesus actually possesses pearls (in the physical sense) the wealthy pass him by. The poor, however, who are eager for a first hand look at a real pearl, hang around.

Traditional shamanic peoples around the world say the Blue Stone or Apple is actually how our soul travels to the inner realm and it is inside of a quantum egg or in an “ interphasic state of existence ” (able to jump through time and cross great distances or even to use this skill locally).

Rumors of secret chambers in the Great Pyramid filled with fine blue dust abound. The Egyptians looked forward to their souls coming to life “like a water lily reopening”, thinking that the deceased died as the water lily closed awaiting opening with the morning sun. The Book of the Dead has a spell to allow the deceased to transform into one of these flowers: In this drawing of the Egyptian blue stone bowl, three fish gather at a point in a circle , the hieroglyph for sun, light, gold, the Milky Way’s G-Spot and the Milky Way herself.

Some people today believe that the Egyptians used this plant as a narcotic both for its healing qualities and as a recreational drug when soaked in wine, though this is a hotly debated topic. The Gnostics adopted the Egyptian blue lily symbolism. In the alchemical Book of the Holy Trinity from Germany we find a remarkable depiction of the cross of Jesus growing as a blue lily out of the Holy Virgin Mari who kneels on the crescent moon.

Buddha, the ‘Great Enlightener’ is often portrayed emerging from an open lotus, his head surrounded by a halo of light. The lotus was originally the flower of Lilith who is also Is-Tara or Astarte, the Sumero-Babylonian Goddess of creation. 31 The northern Europeans called her Eostre , the Goddess of “Easter” lilies. 32 In medieval times the Easter lily was the pas-flower or Paschal flower, from the Latin passus , to step or pass over , cognate of pascha , the Passover. 33 The pagans believed that when Hera’s milk spurted from her breasts to form the Milky Way, the drops that fell to the ground became lilies. 34 These drops of matter from the Galactic G- Spot were the “blue stones” or “blue apples” that transformed men into Shining Ones or gods able to pass through (Yaldabaoth) to the realm of light.

THE REALM OF THE ILLUMINATI From the forgoing we have learned that, in the Gnostic view, the soul is a ship a bottle or a divine pearl in an oyster. Human beings are merchant ships in a strange port. Though imprisoned in the evil “matter” of earth, humanity carries within itself the leftover sparks of the precosmic Pleroma that existed before the creation of humanity. These sparks are called the Blue Pearl. Our body cloaks this spiritual “spark”. We must be decloaked for us to rediscover our true being and to return to the primordial state of the Pleroma where, says Jung, there is a perfect interplay of cosmic forces. 1 The Gnostics (including the Cathars) sought to be “aware of the pleroma” in a profound way -- to feel the fullness of it within their (foolish) selves. Jung comments that the Pleroma is “a state of fullness where the pairs of opposites, yea and nay, day and night, are together...” This matches comments such as this, from the Gospel of Thomas : Jesus said to them, “When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 122 make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female; ...then will you enter the kingdom” The Pleroma is the evolutionary leap beyond human in the writings of Dane Rudhyar, author of The Astrological Mandala . It is a planetary Communion with the Higher Source, the God Head. It transcends all cultures. Interestingly, in the Greek lexicon the pleroma is a word for a ship filled with sailors. “What we call mankind,” observes Rudhyar, “is but the long, gradual, arduous, often tragic, and always dangerous transition between the level of ‘life’ — as we know it in the earth’s biosphere, where it operates as a quasi-instinctual and compulsive type of homogeneity — and that of the Pleroma.” The highest possibility of consciousness operates in this Pleroma state. It is here we find the ultimate human, (the Oracle). “Subconsciously, if not consciously,” says Rudhyar, “humanity aspires to such a state because it is humanity’s function on this planet to be the transition between two levels of being: the vegetable and Pleroma states.” 3 ENKI’S SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND According to the Gnostics, during the travails described in Hypostasis of the Archons , The Apocryphon of John and"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 123 The Hymn of the Pearl the “true” ( blue ) God, observing these events from the Pleroma , decides to help humankind, who, though unknowingly and helplessly trapped in evil and corrupt matter, nonetheless contains a spark of divinity (the Blue Stone, Pearl or Apple), which longs to rejoin the God Head , if only it could escape the body and the Earth. Thus, the highest God sends the serpent to the garden to help Adam and Eve in their plight. This serpent is not a lowly reptile. In the original Sumerian telling of this tale, the serpent is E.A. or Enki the god of smith craft, technology and alchemy who, we are told, came to Earth on a rescue mission after the destruction of the Maiden of Life or Watery Dragon of Chaos , Tiamat, in search of gold and blue stones that cause illumination. He is said to have manufactured the human body as a slave vehicle in order to mine gold. His half brother, Enlil, opposed him. E.A.’s story bears a powerful resemblance to Yaldabaoth or Ia-du baoth’s. Ia El Da or Ia El Du is evidently the Shining Deus or the ‘divine god’ Ia or Ie . This is Ia or E.A., whose temple-medical facility was called Eri-Du or Ari-Du. It was at Eri-Du , an ancient religious center in Iraq (ancient Su-Meru), that Enki and his assistants created the human body. 4 These assistants, called malachim , 5 (who match the description of the archons of Yaldabaoth) are pictured on page 125.

The story of Enki is told from the Enlilian perspective (as the Gnostic Christian story is told from the orthodox Church’s view). From this view Enki appears as the troublemaking serpent whose wisdom is to be avoided. From the Gnostic or alchemical perspective, when we are told Enki came to Earth to mine gold it points to his true purpose: to mine or ‘save’ souls. I have proposed elsewhere that he came to Earth to rescue the souls of Tiamat, an exploded planet described as a watery dragon of Chaos, and whose story is strikingly reminiscent of Sophia and Yaldabaoth’s.

It is a mechanical contraption that is to be used for the soul to return to the Pleroma. It was at Eridu that Enki taught the secrets of the ME Tablets or ( S)tones of Destiny. After Enki gave him the ME, Adapa, the first man, was nicknamed NUN.ME, or “He who can decipher the MEs” Stones of Light (Stones of the Oracle). For thousands of years the saying “Wise as Adapa” conveyed the idea that someone was exceptionally wise, an Oracle. An early Sumerian ruler invited by the gods to ascend to the heavens was named EN.ME.DUR.AN.KI, which literally meant “ruler whose ME connect Heaven and Earth” or “Master of the Divine Tablets Concerning the Heavens.” NUN ( None , zero ) means “fish” in Hebrew. In Sumer physician-priests wearing fish cloaks identified themselves as emissaries of Enki. This class of priest-healers was known as ashipu or a- ship -u, exorcist priests who were masters of the spells that could drive away sickness. In the Assyrian depiction on the next page they are seen functioning as oracles. The fish symbolism links with the Hindu Blue Being Vishnu or Fishnu and the early Christians who called themselves “sons of the celestial Fish or the Great Fish”. “We small fish,” wrote Tertullian in the second century, “like our Fish, Jesus Christ, swim in the (baptismal) water, and we can be saved only by remaining in it.” And in the following century, St. Cyprian expressed the same belief: “It is in the water that we are reborn, in the likeness of Christ, our Master, the Fish.”"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 127 Priests of the fish god E.A. tend a radiant i pillar surmounted by a winged ring ridden by E.A.

These three rays correspond with the three rays entering the forehead of the pupal Osiris shown previously. Intriguingly, they are also the three ‘rays’ or beams of light of the letter ‘A’.

Bacon’s most intimate friends, relations and correspondents the Rosicrucians, the Illuminati and the Freemasons speak in their books of the necessity for a “universal language,” notes Potts. This language is two- fold, partly signs, but mostly symbols or emblems. It is the language of the “Renaissance.” The greatest flowering of this language is in the works of Francis Bacon.

FRANCIS BACON: ORACLE That the letter A had some vital mysterious Gnostic significance is evident from the words of Jesus found in the The Gospel of the Infancy . 1 This apocryphal book tells us that upon his return to Palla-Stone (Palestine) from Egypt at approximately age 12 Jesus carved twelve clay birds and turned them into live birds by rhythmically clapping his hands over them. He was then sent to school to learn his letters from Zaccheus, a Hebrew priest. Zaccheus wrote out an alphabet for Jesus. He asked him to say Aleph, and when he said aleph, Zaccheus made him say Beth. But Jesus refused. “And he looked upon the teacher Zacchaeus, and said to him: Thou art ignorant of the nature of the Alpha, how canst thou teach others the Beta? Thou hypocrite! First, if thou knowest, teach the A, and we shall believe thee about the B. Then he began to question the teacher about the first letter, and he was not able to answer him. And in the hearing of many, the child says to Zacchaeus: Hear, O Teacher, the order of the first letter, and notice here how it has lines, and a middle stroke crossing those which thou seest common; (lines) brought together; the highest part supporting them; and again bringing them under one head ; with three points (of intersection, ); of the same kind;"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 132 principal and subordinate; of equal length. Thou hast the lines of the A. And when the teacher Zacchaeus heard the child speaking such and so great allegories of the first letter, he was at a great loss about such a narrative, and about his teaching.” At the end of this amazing discourse, Zaccheus was so surprised that he said, “ I believe this boy was born before Noah .” He turned to Jesus’ father, Joseph, and said, “thou has brought a boy to me to be taught, who is more learned than any master.” He then turned to Mary and said, “ your son has no need of any learning .” This exchange clearly shows that the Hebrew priest believed Jesus was demonstrating his proficiency in pre- Flood (Atlantean?) knowledge concerning the alphabet. We should not be surprised to find that the Cathars featured the mysteries of the letter A in their symbol system. The Cathar cross, on page 25, in which the letter ‘A’ emerges from the mouth of an ox that supports the cross, is evidence of this. As in the drawing shown here, the Cathar symbolists put two A’s together to form the twin-peaked M, the holy mountain , with the cross in between.

In Egyptian legend the heron delivered the key of life, a teaching designed to transform us into beings of light that, I believe, was taught in the Language of the Birds. The priests who operated this Oracle are the ‘birds of light’. They gave birth to an oral tradition maintained by the bards (poets) or budd-has (the awakened ones). These ‘wise birds’ transmitted the core knowledge of the ‘oracular head’ through the language of poetry and symbols. The light and dark A’s are their signature.

The 46th Psalm connection looks impressive, but is pure coincidence, say critics, who maintain there is no real evidence that Shakespeare collaborated in translating the King James Bible. William Henry Smith, whose Bacon and Shapespeare was published in 1856, launched the Bacon is Shakespeare theory. In so doing he gave rise to a very powerful corpus of literature that links Shakespeare to Bacon. I’d like now to link Bacon, via the A A , to the Gnostic mysteries we have been discussing. Bacon published books written by other authors under his direction. He had his own wood blocks of devices, some of which were his own design, and every book produced under his direction, whether written by him or not, was marked by the use of one or more of these wood blocks. These authors include Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare, Walter Raleigh, and others. 3 The favorite device was the light A and the dark A . Where did Bacon get this idea? The following is from Mather Walker on the subject. 4 While Francis Bacon was in France during the period from 1576 through 1579 a number of works were published exhibiting his A A handiwork. The A A also appeared in Alciato’s Emblems, ‘the little book’ of riddles by the Italian genius Andrae Alciato (1492-1520) first published in 1531. Classified as a collection of religious love emblems or symbols Alciat’s emblems tell the story of the religion of love, the religion of AMOR of the Cathars. From this, we are to assume that Bacon’s use of the A A indicated the Gnostic origin of his works."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 137 Whether or not he is Shakespeare Bacon ( Beaon ) is considered an illumined mind gifted with prophetic vision, and a true initiate who hid his secrets in cryptograms buried in works bearing the A A . 5 His extraordinary life and works have been rigorously investigated for more than two centuries. His intellectual accomplishments are widely recognized, particularly in academic occult circles, where he is recognized as a link in a great chain of enlightened teachers. He is regarded, noted Manly P. Hall, not as just a man, but rather as the focal point between an invisible institution and a world, which was never able to distinguish between the messenger and the message, which he promulgated. 6 This secret society, most often referred to as Illuminati , having rediscovered the lost secret sacred science sought to preserve and conceal this knowledge through symbols transmitted to its members. Bacon encoded these symbols within his works. By means of a certain key or code readers of these works could find the sacred science whereby a human is raised to the level of the illumined ones. He who solves the mystery of Bacon- Shakespeare will find the key to the lost wisdom of the Illuminati. Hall notes that the key to the Bacon mystery is the Seven-Rayed God. 7 In my opinion, this is Chnoubis, aka Yaldabaoth. THE GNOSTIC SECRET OF THE TEMPLARS While living in Europe, Francis Bacon was initiated into the mysteries of the Order of the Knights Templar and the true secret of Masonic Origin. 8 His connection with them may be traced through his father, Sir Nicholas Bacon,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 138 the descendant, according to S. Baring Gould, of Jacques de Molay, ‘the last Templar’ martyred by Philip of France for his faith, 1314. 9 As Bacon’s choice of symbols suggests, he learned a very special secret, and one shared by the Templars. (Interestingly, the Globe Theater where Shakespeare’s plays were performed was octagonal, like the Templar churches, which were also circular.) According to one provocative theory noted by Kenneth Mackenzie in his late 19 th century Masonic encyclopedia, the original Templar Commanders were initiates to a secret affiliation of primitive Gnostic Christians under the leadership of the Patriarch Theoclete who had made High de Payens (the founder of the Templars) heir to the Apostolic Succession of John the Divine. 10 In other words, the founder of the Templar received a transmission from the Oracle. Intriguingly, this Order is said to have transmitted a secret body of knowledge that passed along a succession through Jesus through Moses (whom many believe to have been Akhenaton). This figure was trained in all the Gnostic wisdom of the Egyptian magi. He taught or transmitted this wisdom down through the Essene/Kanobi discipleship to Jesus, through the Mediatrix (feminine co-Creator) Mary. In time, Jesus transmitted this knowledge to his apostles and disciples. M. Matter and Eliphas Levi were two convinced that the origin of the Johannite Church could be traced to the sect of ancient Christians known as the Mandaeans or Mandaean Sabians, the name of the followers of John the Baptist. “Sabian” is a word derived from the Aramaic- Mandic verb “Saba” which means “baptized” or “dyed”,"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 139 “immersed in water”. “Mandaeans” is derived from “menda” which means in the Mandiac language “knowledge”. Thus, “Mandaean Sabians” means those who are baptized and who know the religion of God This is opposed to the religion about God. Among the peculiar symbols of this Order of the Mandai (also known as the Wise of John and Christians of John) was the figure of a severed head , a reminder of the martyrdom of their first teacher to some, but actually standing for something far more profound. Among the long list of distortions collected by the Holy Inquisition against the Templar Order a reference to the veneration of a head, interpreted as that of the devil or of Mohamet, was chief among the accusations. 11 Nevertheless whether under torture or not many Templars alluded to the image or idol of their Grand Master by the head of an old bearded man, venerating the idol as though it were God himself. This head was called BAPHOMET, a word of unknown meaning. Dead Sea Scroll scholar Hugh Schonfield used a Hebrew code called the Atbash cipher which substitutes the first letter of the alphabet for the last and the second letter for the second last and so to Baphomet. He found that it generates the Greek word Sophia or ‘wisdom’ in English, and that the head was feminine. 12 Had the Templars acquired the wisdom of Sophia, as in Athena, Isis, Mary Magdalene? That is, had they acquired the Pillar of the Oracle, the Stimulator of the Cosmic G-Spot? Of even more interest to us is the theory that Baphomet was a corruption of Abufihamat . 13 The meaning of the word is “Father of Understanding” or “Father of Wisdom.” It is a"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 140 term used to refer to a Sufi Master. In Arabic, father is taken to mean Source. If this is the case, this could imply God or the God Head. The Templars were quite likely to have come in contact with Sufism while in the Holy Land and many believe they absorbed some of their practices into the Templar rituals. Other accusations said that the Templars believed that “the head could save them; it could make them rich; it could make the trees flower and the land germinate.” It likely was kept in a round church. The Templars made their churches round because this was the shape of the head (and of Solomon’s Temple). 14 The Chronicles of St. Denis by Guillaume Paradin states that the head seemed to be of flesh, with dog hairs, and without gold or silver ornamentation, but from the neck region to over the shoulders it was completely strewn with gold and precious jewels. The head had a bluish color and spots. It had a beard of black and white hairs, similar to the beard worn by some Templars. Saint Denis was the Christianized remake of the wine god Dionysus in Paris. Like Orphic shrines of Dionysus, the shrine of St. Denis featured an oracular head. It was claimed that, having been decapitated at Mont Martre (Mount of Martyrs), Denis then carried his own skull to his abbey. 15 St. Denis is a key repository for Templar secrets, including those of the Ark of the Covenant, which the Templars are said to have recovered from the site of Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem in the early 1100s.

ABYDOS AND THE HEAD OF SOPHIA In order to fully understand the Oracle we must briefly explore the Egyptian Temple of Seti at Abydos, the one time home of the head of Osiris and its stand. 1 Abydos is Egypt’s oldest royal cemetery. The ancient Egyptians said that at sunset, the area around this holy land looked like a golden staircase leading to the afterlife, and thus many people wished to be buried here. It’s the location where, in myth, Osiris came back to power after being deceived by his brother, Seth, god of the moon. The Temple of Seti is conveniently located beside the Osirion, an extremely ancient temple considered to be the tomb of Osiris. King Seti (1294-1279 BC), we are told by modern commentator Omm Sety, built the temple at Abydos to honor Osiris in accordance with the demands of a divine oracle. 2 She attributes the unusual L pattern of the Seti Temple to the unexpected rediscovery of the Osirion by Seti’s craftsmen when constructing his temple. Various commentators, including Omm Sety, argued that Seti had foreknowledge of the location of the Osiron (from the oracle) and located his temple there in order to discover and connect it to the Osirion. Now this is interesting. Osiris’ head surely ‘talks’. Is it possible this head may have been the source of the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 150 information about the location of the head of Osiris (and perhaps something even more fantastic)? That is to say, did this pillar somehow communicate with Seti, letting him know its location? Is this why Seti kept this information secret, even from his architects? Were they constructing an observation (or listening) post beside the tomb of Osiris without even realizing it? A possible reason why Seti would wish to keep the existence of the Osirion quiet is because the Osirion was a connection point to the gods of the First Time, an advanced civilization that vanished (approximately 10,000 B.C) due to a foreseen cataclysm. The gods of the First Time are called the Shemsu-Hor (note the repetition of the name Shem ). The Royal Papyrus of Turin (written during the time of Seti I’s son Ramses II) records that the reign of the Shemsu-hor stretches to remote antiquity (up to a fantastic 40,000 years). 3 These kings lists call the Shemsu-Hor Akhu , meaning ‘Transfigured Spirits’. Akhu or Ax-hu is the plural of akh or ‘light’, inferring that the Shemsu-Hor were light beings. I will refer to them as the Star Walking Illumined Ones or the Illuminati. Robert Bauval speculates that the Shemsu-Hor were ‘a lineage of real (and)... immensely powerful and enlightened individuals’, masters of the science of astronomy, whose purpose was ‘to bring fruition to a great cosmic blueprint’. 4 “In the religious literature of Ancient Egypt,” writes Andrew Collins, “they are said to have become the god’s mesniu , ‘workers of metal’, or blacksmiths’”. 5 The mesniu, says Barbara Walker, were blacksmiths or alchemists and"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 151 priests of Isis. 7 Among other things, these angelic smiths fashioned weapons for Horus to maintain his supremacy. The inference that is drawn here is that the Osiris Symbol (seen on p. 45) enshrined by Seti at Abydos originally belonged to the Shemsu-Hor. These Illumined Ones were the originators of this Pillar/Stimulator. As a means to preserve its secrets, this civilization (Atlantis?) left artifacts, including, I suspect, an all- knowing Oracle. It is called the Head of Osiris. Seti had an image of this Power Tool of the Gods hung on the wall at Abydos. To uncover the secrets of the Illumined Ones we merely need to decode the Symbol of Osiris: the Oracle . (It appears the Cathars, the Templars and Bacon can be counted among those who have decoded it.) On one wall of the Abydos temple Seti directed that the scribes produce a List of all the Gods who had ruled Egypt, long before the reign of men all the way back to the First Time. On the opposite wall, Seti I inscribed the names and regnal years of the pharaohs who had immediately preceded him. He omitted Akhenaton and his immediate successors (Smenkhkare, Tutankhamun, and Ay). This list is one of the most important in the world for the purposes of historical dating. It begins with the pharaoh Menkaure, 2532-2504 BC, who built the third pyramid at Giza. So why did Seti omit Akhenaton? In a word the answer is control. Egyptologist E.A.

These powers were designed so that humanity could, one day, collectively share in their potentials by activating the Divine Force within. But, claims Budge, the ‘higher’ purpose of these teachings was lost after the Old Kingdom. The priesthood degenerated into a gang of sorcerers who ruled, controlled and manipulated the people under a beurocracy of gods. Numerous researchers have claimed the period of darkness remained in place until the arrival of Akhenaton and Moses (who may be the same) c . 1400 B.C. Akhenaton attempted to overturn the buerocracy by implementing the religion of ATON, the One, eternal invisible Source, symbolized by the winged disk. Akhenaton’s revolutionary teachings enabled all to embody the tone of life, and hence, to put on the Cloak, without the aid of the bureaucratic priesthood. Akhenaton’s reign threw Egypt into chaos as he was declared the ‘heretic’ king and driven from power. His successor, Tutankhamun, was murdered. The old-time religion was restored. Seti sought to wipe out all memory of this revolution. It appears plausible to me that Seti did what a current era President might do upon the discovery of the secrets of the gods. He attempted to make use of them for himself, but covered them up or concealed them from his people. In fact, Seti I spoke of Osiris as the god who would destroy those who disobeyed him. 8 The person that most embodied these secrets -- the man of light -- at the time was not Seti or even Akhenaton.

It was switched because of political pressure from the Amen or Amun priesthood. Following the trail of this king we are led to his throne.

We are many yet one.” The fact that the head of God and the cluster of grapes are interchangeable symbols in Christian terms is enormously profound in its meaning to our investigation. Mary Magdalene was associated in Christian myth with the severed head widely presumed to be the cranium of either Jesus or John the Baptist. Like the Egyptian All , we can now see that this is a symbol for the ultimate knowledge of the four Power Tools and for the Stimulator of the Divine Particle . As I have explored in previous books, especially Blue Apples , I believe this severed skull is a symbol for the Pillar once housed at Abydos and that this is a skill , the Wisdom of God, Sophia or Baphomet. Possessing this skill, also symbolized by the cluster of grapes, transforms one into the Oracle and gives one the ability to open gateways in space and to scale the Ladder to Heaven , the Scala Dei (in Latin). These are the secrets stolen by the two spies, Joshua (Jesus in Greek) and Caleb, from the Anunnaki at Eschol (‘the valley of the cluster, as in grapes) – i.e. E- School or E- Skull .

In Godseed: The Journey of Christ , 14 Dr. Jean Houston presents what I consider a major revelation when she notes that Christos and Chrestos were interchangeable terms to the early Christians. Chrestos means simpleton, great silly or blessed one . She says that, in one of the apocryphal traditions, Pontius Pilate is supposed to have said to Jesus upon the Pillar, “ Ain Chrestos !” or “You are the great silly.” 15 When the interchangeability between silly and skilly, both words mean “blessed,” is taken into account, might Pilate have meant to say, “You are the great Chrestos or Skilly?” Did this mean “You are the Druid of great wisdom!” or “You are the great Blessed One !?” Paul affirms this notion that Jesus is the incarnation of the divine Wisdom when he says, “he is the power and the wisdom of God.” 16 In John 10:19 Jesus said: ! “I am the door .

An interesting line of ‘head’ stories accompanies the story of Mary Magdalene. Cathar relics found in the preceptory of Villeneuve, France, are said to have included a hinged casket shaped like a woman’s head. Reportedly within the casket were two pieces of a female skull labeled CAPUT LVIII (Head 58). The Inquisitors were said to have found this head in the Paris Temple, labeled Caput LVIII. This head is a shrine containing some bones from a woman’s head. When the Templars were asked about this head, they either said it was a Christian martyr woman, or it was the model of the speaking head that the pope Sylvester II made . Pope Sylvester II (d. 1003) was believed to have possessed a golden head which spoke to him in oracles. The Pope d’Aurillac, also known as Sylvester II, was most famously known as the owner of a giant automaton oracle head given to him by a magician with incredible power. This mechanical head could answer any question posed to it with a yes or no answer. A Spanish magician known as the Black Moor programmed the oracle head. The Black Moor is also said to be the author of King Solomon’s Key , an important occult text that had influenced Nostradamus and Doctor John Dee. Sylvester II died in 1003, in a bizarre murder plot just before ending the dark ages. The giant oracle head has not been found. References still exist in the Vatican library. !"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 158 Inventor of Recursive Machines, Perpetual Motion Machines, Magic Staircases, Celestial globes, the Pendulum Clock, and Master of the Astrolabe, the genius d’Aurillac was also condemned as a dangerous madman and black magician. According to legend, his book of time was considered a dangerous, monstrous object, and if this infernal book were ever destroyed, the universe would be consumed along with it. Before d’Aurillac died he wrote a brief warning about reading the signs in the book called SYMBOSIS DESTINOS INFINITUM and buried the book deep within the catacombs underneath the Vatican. 17 It is a well-attested fact that Pope Sylvester II was publicly accused by Cardinal Benno with being a sorcerer and an enchanter. The brazen “oracular head” made by his Holiness was of the same kind as the one fabricated by Albertus Magnus. The latter was smashed to pieces by Thomas Aquinas, not because it was the work of or inhabited by a “demon,” but because the spook who was fixed inside, by mesmeric power, talked incessantly, and his verbiage prevented the eloquent saint from working out his mathematical problems. These heads and other talking statues, trophies of the magical skill of monks and bishops, were fac-similes of the “animated” gods of the ancient temples. One wonders if one these temples as the Serapeum of Alexandria. The accusation against the Pope was proved at the time. It was also demonstrated that he was constantly attended by “demons” or spirits. 18 Francis Bacon, in my view, followed in the footsteps of Sylvester. To repeat, I believe the A A symbolism used by Bacon to identify his words connects him with the head of God transmission."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 159 From his understanding of the secret information he had learned during his initiation into the Knights Templar concerning this head, I believe Bacon conceived the idea of reactivating various Secret Societies and in 1580 founded the secret Rosy Cross Literary Society in Gray’s Inn. Later, such luminaries as Sir Isaac Newton would become Rosicrucians and set their sites on attaining invisibility. 19 He was among the Illumined Ones. By far, Bacon’s most intriguing work that contains references to the Pillar of the Oracle is the New Atlantis , a work of fiction that announced an allegorical vision for an illumined culture in America. It is an Illuminati Manifesto. Fearing retribution from the power that seeks to block the efforts of investigators Bacon allowed the book to be published only after his death (in 1626). In the story we visit the island of BenSalem (Solon of Salem, meaning ‘Peace’). Saloman’s House. The governor of the island meets the group and tells them a phenomenal story. About twenty years after the ascension of their Savior the people of Renfusa (a city upon the eastern coast of the island) saw a great pillar of light , a column , or cylinder , rising from the sea toward heaven . On the top of it was seen a large cross of light, ‘more bright and resplendent than the body of the pillar’. At first, the people of the city watched the spectacle from the shore.

At last, he fell to his knees, lifted his hands in prayer and spoke to the pillar floating on the water. “‘Lord God of heaven and earth; thou hast vouchsafed of thy grace , to those of our order to know thy works of creation, and true secrets of them; and to discern, as far as appertaineth to the generations of men, between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art and impostures, and illusions of all sorts.” In other words, the pillar of light Bacon is descrbing was a teacher of all the arts and sciences of civilization.

When he was close upon it the pillar and cross of light broke up, “and cast itself abroad, as it were, into a firmament of many stars, which also vanished soon after, and there was nothing left to be seen but a small ark or chest of cedar” that floated toward him, and contained a small green branch of palm.

In addition to references to unknown biblical texts, Bacon’s New Atlantis is loaded with references to a futuristic technology. “We procure means of seeing objects afar off, as in the heaven and remote places; and represent things near as afar off, and things afar off as near; making feigned distances.

The assertion has been made that Enki and the Anunnaki created humans in their image as a slave race to mine gold (which is only half of the story, and is fact which suggests that the original seven Anunnaki could take on human form).

The only difference between the Hebrew words for light and skin is one letter: Aleph (t) for light and Ayin (g) for skin. The Hebrew word for “Light” is “OR” (variant: ! ‘ur) spelled “aleph ! vav ! resh” – rut (a way, pass, road or route , rut ). The Hebrew word for “skin” is also “OR” (variant: ! ‘or ), but is spelled “ ayin ! vav ! resh” – rug . 15 (Remember, Hebrew words are read right to left). In the metaphorical use ‘or signifies life over against death, Ps. 56:13. To walk in the “light” of the face of a superior, Prov. 16:15, or of God. Ps. 89:15, is an expression of a joyful, blessed (Skilled) life in which the quality of life is enhanced. The letter Ayin ( eye in ) is represented by an eye and means to see, know or experience . ! Thus, when Adam and Eva ate the forbidden fruit (the Blue Apple) their eyes were opened and they began to know and experience good and evil. They also knew they were naked. The idea of the open eye and the blossoming of human potential is central to the concept of the Oracle. In fact, it is embedded in the name Os-Iris. The Bible gives us a reference in Matthew 6:22 “If your eye be single your body will fill with light .” Then we have the remark of Jacob in Genesis 32:30 “ I have seen God face to face and I will call the place Peniel .” Though Peniel is spelled differently then Pineal they are both pronounced the same, indicating the presence of an important word play or pun ( pala-y or pa-un ).

If UFO researcher and super pilot John Lear is correct, immediately after this quest was conducted (1933-1935) several UFO crash recoveries were made including ‘the big one’ at Roswell, which became public knowledge. According to a briefing Lear gave to radio talk show host Art Bell, 2 there were two survivors of the Roswell crash. Of these only one survived, passing in 1956. These beings were among a collection of 18 different alien species monitoring Earth. Some are good and some are hostile, says Lear, most are indifferent. Coinciding with the theory of human origins put forth in Gnostic texts we have explored, Lear says that we found out (rediscovered?) that we are “the experimental product,” “of an unknown alien race.” We know them only by their messengers, the Greys, who are cybernetic organisms,"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 178 glorified robots, who work here at the behest of their employers monitoring us through abductions. Lear claims the government was unable to find out what the experiment is all about except that the human body has been externally altered or corrected more than 60 times. And most insightful of all to our study, the aliens refer to us as “Containers.” There’s been speculation, says Lear, that the souls our bodies contain is the reason for the experiments. But nothing’s been proven or determined. However, as we have seen, the Gnostic Christians shared a similar worldview concerning our bodies. All we need to do is substitute the word “Grey” for “archon” and we have the essential Gnostic story of the creation of humanity. Exo-politics (or the politics of alien affairs) is not the only area where humanity made strides in reclaiming ancient knowledge of the Oracle. In The Day After Roswell , former Pentagon official, Col. Philip J. Corso, (Ret.), revealed his personal involvement in the handling of artifacts from the crash of a UFO at Roswell. 3 He claims the US government reverse- engineered military technology, including a particle beam weapon, from the downed disk and “seeded” alien technology to a Who’s Who of American military contractors.

These developments took us down the rabbit hole of abstract mathematical systems into an alien world that shattered common-sense preconceptions about the nature of things. There is no direct evidence that this science came from aliens. I do feel, however, that a strong case is being made for this origin by numerous researchers. Compelling evidence is also being presented that traces usage of this same science to the ancient world. In the early 20 th century the newly ( re)discovered phenomenon of radioactivity, Rutherford’s experiments in atomic transmutation and Marie Curie’s breakthroughs in radiation, may well have represented the return of the ancient science of the Roman god Mercury or Mari-cury. Einstein’s Relativity theory (1905), which introduced the modern world to the paradoxical ideas on the nature of time, and the quantum theory with its sea of probabilities, in which an electron is simultaneously a wave , and a particle or dot • , seemed light years removed from the comfort of the metaphysical Kansas of the past several hundred years. However, as our investigation into Gnostic symbols has shown, Jesus and the early Gnostic Christians may have applied and encoded this theory."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 180 Since Einstein, physicists have been pursuing a Holy Grail theory to unite the four fundamental forces of nature (the four evangelists) within one common mathematical structure, a Unified Field Theory or Theory of Everything (TOE). Such a theory would answer questions like: How did the universe begin? What is the origin of time? What is the secret of time travel? Various ideas were proposed -- Super-symmetry, String theory, the idea that a particle was actually a tiny super quantum string that both vibrates at specific frequencies (like a guitar or kitara string) and rotates in a ten-dimensional space. ‘Kansas’ suddenly vanished and a ‘new’ matrix appeared. Beginning in the 1970s a crisis emerged in physics as it burst through a threshold in the alien world into a realm of speculative super metaphysics. Simply, the advanced theories of the brightest minds of modern physics have little direct connection with anything that can be empirically measured. It’s pure speculation (some would call pseudoscience). There can be no experiments conceivable to test these elegant theories. The energies required are staggeringly high. We are still decades away before human beings can harness enough energy to perform the quantum gravity experiments that need to be done to make us a Type II civilization. The present generation of particle accelerators (an immensely powerful knife that cuts matter into quarks and reveals the forces that drive them), though they are considered the most complex experimental tools ever built, are thought to be billions of times less powerful than the energies required to test the theories of quantum gravity which unite the four fundamental forces. Quantum theory, notes Nobel Prize winning physicist Leon"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 181 Lederman, “demands more and more powerful accelerators to study smaller and smaller things.” The problem is further complicated, observes science writer David Peat, by the fact that the theories presented by today’s “post modern physics” are so far removed from our ordinary reality, so abstract and so advanced that they cannot even describe to one another the theories with our present mathematical and symbolic language systems. 4 To paraphrase David Peat, it’s like trying to explain Eddie Van Halen’s electric guitar sound in words. All physicists (who must feel like they were born a hundred years too soon) can do to test the cosmological consequences of their theories is to test their consistency and their interrelationship with other theories of the universe. In other words, as a result of the light speed technological progress we have achieved since the 1950’s we have encountered the ring pass not. The “great dream” is to pass through this ring. In order to do so, I believe, we must contact the God Head for the next clue as to how to harness the power of our galaxy. Meanwhile, as physicists searched for the TOE, metaphysicians and psychologists, including Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Carl G. Jung, sought the secrets of synchronicity and a psychological theory of everything to explain meaningful coincidence. Jung is also the first scientist to seriously study UFOs. Between 1912 and 1926, Jung delved into a study of Gnosticism and early Christianity. He found in Gnosticism an early, prototypical depth psychology. He believed that Christianity, and as a result Western culture, had suffered"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 182 because of the repression of Gnostic concepts. Gnosis leads to connecting with the inner Oracle and the God Head. In looking for ways to reintroduce Gnostic ideas to modern culture, Jung found them in alchemy and in a sequence of 12 operations. 5 Jung defined synchronicity as the co-incidence in time of two or more causally unrelated events which have the same meaning. Jung’s definition infers that certain events in the universe cluster together by a force that operates outside of the normal laws of science. They represent the transcendent, unseen hand of God operating in our lives. (Critics claim Jung suffered from a mental disorder known as apophenia , the spontaneous perception of connections and meaningfulness of unrelated phenomena.) Synchronicity theory flew in the face of cause and effect physics, which sees the universe as a string of events with each event arising from the event before it. In this theory we are all rather like a person walking through a hall of doors. As we open one door it opens into another hall and another door, ad infinitum. Jung’s theory takes us above the hall itself and looks for the cause of the door’s opening from outside the hallway. It is intended to help us make contact with the Source. Synchronicities, notes David Peat, were crucial to the concept of history in ancient China. 6 Contrary to the West’s view that all historical events are strictly the end result of cause and effect, Chinese history was viewed in terms of the cluster of events that coincidentally happened to occur together in time. Omens were recorded along with military expeditions. According to Hellmut Wilhelm, son of the famous translator of the I Ching :"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 183 “The interplay of forces that determine a historical moment sounds a chime... only by concentrating on this sound and yielding to it may we recognize its essence and its effect.” 7 In the Eastern view an event is unique and individual, but is also the manifestation of a greater order. This greater order, the key to Jung’s theory of synchronicity, was the Pleroma , the “God Head” out of which all reality is born. 8 The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia provides this translation of pleroma, which is generally, but not invariably, rendered “ fullness ” in the New Testament. Etymologically, pleroma -- which itself is derived from the verb pleroo , “I fill” (a pun on I fool) -- signifies “that which is or has been filled”; it also means “that which fills or with which a thing is filled”; then it signifies “fullness,” “a fulfilling.” The ‘real’ psycho-physical world we inhabit is a copy of the higher perfect order of the Pleroma. This synchronistic intelligence holds the world together. The Oracle is the one who can connect with this Source and fill the body with its light. They are the bridge between Heaven and Earth. In synchronicity theory the bridge does not have to go far. The distance between objects becomes zero, , the distance between events becomes zero, , and everything occurs synchronistically .

In his discourse Phaeado , ‘Plato’– the nickname of Ari- Stocles (about 427–347 B.C.), the aristocratic Athenian oracle who reintroduced the story of Atlantis to the modern mind -- makes an astonishing observation that reveals the logo of the Oracle.

Where did Plato get the inspiration to describe Earth as a three-dimensional pentagonal web into which the soul incarnates? Did he have some means of traveling into our Blue Apple’s orbit to make such a statement? Did he learn it from some secret sect of initiates?

This is the “pattern” mentioned in The Hypostasis of the Archons: “And she established each of his offspring in conformity with its power – after the pattern of the realms that are above, for by starting from the invisible world the visible world was invented .” When the Hebrews said we were made in the image of God it meant we were made of this thought substance, the Word from the God Head . Today, dodecahedron shaped nanoassemblers may be the key to creating a new world at the nano level. Following the As above. So Below law the earthly Matrix is a miniature of the cosmic Matrix. Plato appears to have recognized the dodachedron’s role in the creation of his world. His description suggests there is a hidden energetic component – a 12-angled Planetary Grid or Matrix – that surrounds the Earth. As we follow the thread of the number twelve we are led into a rich net of associations that shine like metaphysical gems. The Tree of Life had 12 fruits. The breastplate of the Hebrew head-priest, the Oracle, had 12 stones. Twelve is the number of constellations, tribes, and apostles. A key connection between the Ladder to Heaven and the number 12 is found in the Genesis story of Jacob’s ladder. At Luz (‘light’ or ‘almond’) Jacob lay his head on a stone and saw a ladder with angels on either"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 190 side. 16 He ascended this ladder to a heavenly realm. Upon his return he declared the spot of real estate (the oracle) a “blessed gate to Heaven.” 17 In Genesis 28:18 he then set up a pillar (a Cosmic G- Spot Stimulator?) on the spot and poured oil upon it. There were Twelve Tribes of Israel who were the 12 sons of Jacob. Following the ‘As Above. So Below’ law when Jacob gave his blessing to his twelve sons, he was referring not only to twelve individuals, but to the development of twelve attributes to be awakened within in the human soul (by the Oracle). These paralleled the twelve characteristics of the twelve signs of the zodiac, the star gate. 18 The work of these twelve sons dominated most of the Old Testament. Each tribe expressed the qualities of one sign of the zodiac and responded to a certain number. No tribe was wholly good or bad. These twelve signs and their corresponding numbers are operative in the lives of every individual, for each person indeed is a miniature universe. Another excellent example of how the dodecahedral symbolism is hidden with the symbolism of the Israelites is the story of Aaron, the Hebrew Oracle. A A RON THE ORACLE In approximately 1400 B.C. Aaron (‘the Enlightened’ or ‘the Illumined’), Moses’s brother, had been initiated into the ancient Sumerian and Egyptian mysteries of the Oracles. This is evidenced by the device, which Aaron"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 191 wore along with the Garment of Glory of the Head Priest, called the Essen or Breastplate of Righteousness and Prophecy . Inside the Essen Aaron was told to place the “Urim and Thummim”. 19 This device was made of 12 stones. Josephus called it ‘the Oracle’ and is said to resemble the Earth. This description is a hint that we are talking about the dodecahedron. The precision with which the Israelites crafted the cloak of Aaron (‘light’, ‘enlightened’) in preparation for his meetings with the Lord, 20 reveals that it served an important function. It filled him with the Holy Spirit, says Exodus. 21 (In Gnostic terms, it connected him with the fullness of the Pleroma.) We know that Aaron wore this cloak when he tended the Ark of the Covenant. Aaron’s cloak operated in conjunction with the Ark. In addition to the breastplate, this suit featured a blue ephod with gold wires interwoven in it, and a robe, an embroidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle. 22 Pomegranates (balls, apples) of blue, of purple, of scarlet hung from the hem. A crown or “miter” (modeled after the fish headed priests of E.A.) was to be worn on top of the head. The vestments of the High Priest make more than a fashion statement. They symbolize the four levels or elements within a human being. The outer blue ephod, with its golden wiring, represents the Divine part of a man (Azilut), with the blue surcoat as a heavenly or spiritual aspect (Beriah). The under garment represents the souls (Yezirah), and the priest’s own body is the physical vessel, container or temple. The task of the Illumined one is to bring all these ‘wheels’ or ‘levels’ into a harmonious vehicle, in order to become a being in whom – as in the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 192 Head Priest – the universe and Divinity are consciously manifest and speak to the people. In reading the Old Testament we get the impression that the Urim and Thummim figure as part of the equipment of the High priest, functioning in conjunction with the ephod. (In other words it was a part of the Cloak of Light or the Cloak of the Illi or Illuminati.) In special circumstances the Bible refers to the Ephod as having oracular ability. 23 So closely are their functions matched that they appear to be one and the same thing. The oracular function is reinforced by the Hebrew word for the breast pocket in which the Urim and Thummim were contained, hoshen hammishpat , which means “the breastplate of the oracular decision.” The Urim and Thummim are among the most unique objects in all myth and Scripture, in that it appears humans did not make them. Unlike the Ark of the Covenant and the Cloak of Aaron, the method of the construction of these sacred objects is not detailed nor is a clear description provided of their appearance. The meanings of the words in Hebrew are Thummim (perfections), and Urim (lights), rendering them/it as Perfect Light . Although this Perfect Light is referenced several times in the Old Testament, there is an aura of darkness about it, as no one over the intervening several thousand years can say to what it referred, save for the fact that it was some sort of instrument through which Aaron could communicate with Yahweh and receive his encrypted decisions and which translated languages. 24 When functioning this oracle apparently emitted light. This conclusion is supported by the report of Josephus in"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 193 his Antiquities of the Jews , Book III, chapter 8, section 9, where he mentions: “...yet will I mention what is still more wonderful than this: for God declared beforehand, by those 12 stones which the High Priest bare on his breast, and which were inserted into his breastplate, when they should be victorious in battle; for so great a splendor shone forth from them before the army began to march , that all the people were sensible of God’s being present for their assistance... now this breastplate, and this sardonyx, left off shining 200 years before I composed this book, God having been displeased at the transgressions of his laws.” The ‘shining’ aspect of the Urim and Thummin suggests either a radiance, which indicates electricity, or an illumination, wisdom, in which case I would suggest the light is blue. Many believe the Urim and Thummim gave yes or no answers. The people would ask Aaron a question to be answered by God, through the Ark. Aaron would stand before the inquirer, and then would enter the holy of holies of the Tabernacle (the room where the Ark was held). Attempts have been made to connect them to the Babylonian Tablets of Destiny or Stones of Enlightenment. As we investigate these Tablets or Stones we find an important connection to Sophia that can be applied to the Urim and Thummim. Also known as the ME (pronounced may ), the Babylonian word for “mother-wisdom” these oracular tablets are cognate with the Sanskrit medha , feminine wisdom, and Egyptian Stone of met or Maat (‘Truth’).

Along with the icosahedron the dodecahedron represented male and female powers respectively. The Icosahedron has 20 faces and 12 vertices while the Dodecahedron has 12 faces and 20 vertices, an exact reciprocal of each other. To me it would make sense that one of the stones used to communicate with God would be shaped like God. Edgar Cayce concurred with biblical experts who speculated the Urim and Thummin were blue stones , although he thinks the were possibly lapis , 25 long considered the stone of the gods. I am nonetheless encouraged by Cayce’s conclusion, as this would align the Urim and Thummim with the Blue Pearl and the Blue Apple."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 195 11.

The Oracle is the place where the mighty heavenly waters meet the Earth. “The miracle,” said John Lilly, “is that the universe created a part of itself to study the rest of it, and that this part in the studying itself finds the rest of the universe in its own natural inner realities.” The pentagonal face of the dodecahedron refers us to ancient legends of the Perfect Man , for the star born within the dodecahedron’s pentagon is the configuration of Cosmic Man, says Robert Lawlor in his book Sacred Geometry .

Plato taught that this twin was our Guardian Spirit. 6 The purified ones (Cathars) were shown with outstretched arms like the pentagrammic man.

We may consider the head as simultaneously a transmitting and receiving antenna, tuned to a particular one of the several resonant frequencies of the brain.’ !

His studies revealed that it is a producer of the chemical"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 208 DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. Plants also manufacture this hallucinogenic chemical or “spirit molecule” as Strassman terms it. It consistently produces near-death and mystical experiences, including startling encounters with intelligent nonhuman beings (possibly “aliens”). Subjects frequently reported making “contact” and dialoging with “guides” and “helpers” from the nonmaterial realms. DMT is certainly a qualified contender for the trigger of the Blue Apples or Blue Stones of the Oracle. One detail of the DMT experience is most intriguing. Subjects reported a humming sound or an intense pulsating-buzzing sound and vibration that preceded the appearance of “alien” humanoid beings who were “gatekeepers” . 15 One subject described these entities pouring communication into him. Another described them as “cloaked”, like silhoutettes. 16 They operated technology or machinery. Complimentary to Dr. Strassman’s research are the findings of influential psychiatrist John Mack who has published several key works on the alien abduction phenomenon. 17 His description of the abduction experience has several important parallels with the DMT experience. As the abduction begins, Mack says, “consciousness is disturbed by a bright light , humming sounds , strange bodily vibrations or paralysis... or the appearance of one or more humanoid or even human-appearing strange beings in their environment.” Mack highlights the sense of high-frequency vibrations many abductees report. So powerful is this experience, reports Mack, it makes abductees feel as if they"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 209 are coming apart at the molecular level. Some abductees report that the experience of having instant transfer of massive amounts of information downloaded through some form of neuropsychological programming. Abductees explain the alien language as a universal language of visual symbols, instead of words or sounds. Two important common elements, perhaps links, between the DMT experience and the “abduction” experience is that the beings appear to envy our embodiment and the subjects feel the experience is transformation and spiritual that provides a feeling of connectedness with all of creation . 18 Strassman’s and Mack’s inspired research will help open the way toward a fuller understanding the pineal and DMT and will push the boundaries of science and spirituality. In addition to DMT, another psychoactive (an illegal) substance is Ketamine, widely used as an animal tranquilizer by veterinarians. At lower doses it has a mild, dreamy feeling similar to nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Users report feeling floaty and slightly outside their body. Numbness in the extremities is also common. Higher doses of “Special K” produce a hallucinogenic (trippy) effect, and may cause the user to feel very far away from their body. This experience is often referred to as entering a “K-hole” and has been compared to a near death experience with sensations of rising above one's body. Many users find the experience spiritually significant, while others find it frightening. It can be extremely dangerous. Reading the following description of a Ketamine"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 210 experience reveals details that are, by now, quite familiar to us. “I lay down, and within two or three minutes the now familiar onset of the Ketamine overtook me; a loud ringing in my ears , followed by a narrowing/contraction of my reality tunnel until the outside world and my physical body were utterly gone. Then, instead of the usual complete merge with pure consciousness, I found myself as a bodiless point of awareness and energy floating in the midst of what seemed to be a vast vaulted chamber. There was a sense of presence all around, as though I was surrounded by millions of others, although no one else could be seen. In the center of the chamber was a huge, pulsing, krishna-blue mass of seething energy that was shaped in a geometric, mandalic form . I had the sense that I had somehow stumbled into the blast furnace at the heart of the cosmos, the engine that drives the process of creating manifest reality out of the thoughts of the mind of god. It was pulsing at a steady pace, and emitting sound vibrations (which sounded remarkably like chanted “Om’s”) as it pulsed that instantly crossed a synesthetic line from something heard to an object beheld, much like McKenna’s descriptions of the language of the elves he encounters in DMT space.” 19 Advances in neuroscience have recently provided us with new insights as to the mechanisms involved at the mind-brain interface. Another series of studies carried out since 1985 has involved the mulberry shaped crystalline deposits in the Pineal. Recently, however, a study led by Sydney Lang and carried out in Israel using scanning electron microscopy"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 211 described the presence of a new form of small geometric shapes which the discoverers have called “brain dust.” Reasons for the formation of the cubic, hexagonal and cylindrical microcrystals and their possible biological significance is not known at this time. The crystals are calcite. However, since the crystals exhibit piezeoelctric properties, researchers have speculated that a coupling mechanism to external electromagnetic fields is possible. 20 This may be the “brain sand” of the alchemists. The drug-induced NDE, and the alien abduction phenomenon, is of considerable importance to medicine, neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, psychology and, more controversially, philosophy and theology. Recent advances in neuroscience are bringing us closer to a brain-based understanding of the NDE as an altered state of consciousness. To fully embrace these findings we must leave behind the restrictive shackles of science and religio-political policy and embrace a new paradigm based heightened upon human spiritual experience. This will open our civilization to a dimension of mind in which the Oracle dwells and all can experience the Blue Lord. SA The returns us to Sa , the other half of the Saba word equation.

Like its counterpart the Hindu soma it made pharaohs wise and immortal."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 212 Interestingly, sa is found in the Egyptian sas , the Assyrian sissa , and Sanskrit sas , all meaning six . As I discussed in God Making , the holy blood of Isis became the holy blood of Christ ( IS-SA in India), which is actually a combination of blood and holy water , or what used to be called the Lustral Water . 21 This blood insures longevity, increases intelligence and enables us to demonstrate the advanced capabilities of the Oracle. With the advancements in medical nanotechnology it could be a medical reality within the next two decades. On the drawing board of nano wizards are much-hyped medical nanites that could patrol your body, and armed with knowledge of your DNA, repel any foreign invaders by forming an artificial immune system. The common cold would no longer exist, nor would threats of any biological or viral infection. Biological warfare would then cease to be a threat, also. With medical nanites, we can not only extend our lives (by replacing our bodies), but also stop completely the aging process. Of utmost interest to us is the belief that this blood contained (or enabled access to) the Great Mother’ Sophia or the Pleroma’s -- -- spirit of all sacred wisdom or intelligence which the Greeks called nous . Nous is the root of the Noosphere , the name given to the holographic library of the Global Mind present at the 12 oracular centers by the French theologist Teilhard de Chardin."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 213 The sacred knowledge, it seems, concerns the ship of life itself . Supporting this notion is the fact that the Greek for ship is naus , which may be equated with nous , meaning the mind. As noted, rig or mast of the ship may have received its name from the mast of the ship of knowledge (the Rig Veda). The Oracle, among other things, possesses knowledge of how to turn water into wine (in their blood) in order to connect with the knowledge in the Noosphere and download the knowledge that makes one an Oracle. The rod or ray of life in Jesus’ hand symbolized this knowledge (that detail will be explored momentarily). Putting on this ‘fleece’ enabled the opening of the and connecting with the Self or Source of Creation. These traditions were evidently of particular interest to Salvador Dali (1904–1989) who hung a dodecahedron behind Jesus at the Last Supper (1955). This extraordinary painting is one in a series of controversial paintings by Dali with evocative Gnostic Christian meets hyperspace physics themes.

There is a saying that when one points to the moon, the finger is not the moon. Don’t mistake the finger for the moon. Jesus points his finger at the dodecahedron. Dali is directing us to the secret of the Oracle. He is also saying don’t mistake Jesus for the secret. He is pointing to the secret. Those who engage Jesus in a slave-master relationship have confused the finger with the secret. The finger is not the secret. The dodecahedron is, but we’ve got to have some one to point us to it. This, modern science has done for us. The Oracle transcends the one who pointed the finger and becomes the finger pointer himself.

THE BIG SECRET According to Michael S. Schneider, the Founding Fathers of America -- Bacon’s New Atlantis -- encoded the twelve-fold structure-function-order in many different ways.

Above the head a bald eagle is a glory of light and clouds enclosing pentagonal stars explicitly displaying the pattern. When he magnifies the glory’s geometry and applies it to the whole of the seal, the underlying 12-fold plan upon which the seal was composed is revealed."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 218 Another example of dodecahedral symbolism to be considered is that of 20 th century occult scholar Rudolph Steiner, the man whom Adolf Hitler feared the most of all men. On the evening of September 20, 1913, Dr. Steiner laid a foundation Stone (made of copper) into the hill at Dornach to celebrate the dedication of the completion of his spiritual center the Goetheanum. The holy stone was in the shape of a double pentagonal dodecahedron which he said “represents the striving human soul immersed as macrocosm in the microcosm.” As opposed to the cuboctahedron, which represents a group of spiritual impulses, the similar 12-fold dodecahedron, represents “the cosmic image of the human soul.” This building burned to the ground on New Years Eve, 1922 and remarkably, the original foundation Stone survived. One year later, at Christmas 1923, Dr. Steiner rededicated the Anthroposophical Society and the new Goetheanum. 2 Steiner knew that the human body is the most significant spiritual symbol of all. In order comprehend the mysteries of this symbol and to sit at the dodecahedral round table with 12 holes we must develop our consciousess of the Blue Pearl. It is this consciousness that prepares the way for the Oracle to climb the ladder from Heaven to greet us. This is done in steps, observes Joseph Campbell.

This is the love of the Oracle, who acts out of this knowledge. Angel wearing a halo with 12 holes. It is possible that the Greeks and the Gnostics inherited the ideas of the twelve-fold pattern from the Egyptians, who separated the Duat or Underworld into 12 divisions, variously and appropriately, described as fields or plains (a pun on planes), caverns or halls . The Egyptian journey of the Pharaoh-initiate through the Duat (sometimes Tuat ), as recounted by Zecharia Sitchin, 4 has several points of correspondence with Thomas’s journey in The Hymn of the Pearl . In his journey to the Ladder to Heaven the Pharaoh encounters the Hidden"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 221 Place called the Amen-Ta , a domain described as a fortified circle. Amen-ta is also identified with Ros-tau , the place where the deceased king would collect the efflux of Osiris , the fifth essence that was required for his journey back to Heaven. 5 Interestingly, Giza, like Amenta, is associated with Ros-tau (the mirror image Stau-Ros , the Greek term for the pillar of crucifixion). According to Utterance 553 of the Pyramid Texts, it was the ‘efflux which issued from the putrefaction of Osiris’. Spell 1080 of the Coffin Texts tells exactly how this ‘efflux’ was brought to Earth. ‘This is a sealed thing which is in darkness, with fire about it, which contains the efflux of Osiris, and it is put in Rostau (Giza, the Pillar of Crucifixion). It has been hidden since it fell from him (Osiris), and it is what came down from him on to the desert of sand’. This is a tip-off that the Cosmic G-Spot Stimulator and the production of the dew or manna is being described. As Andrew Collins notes in The Gods of Eden, a circular chamber of the First Creation divided into twelve parts may be situated beneath the Giza plateau. He likens ito to the underground particle accelerator at CERN in Geneva. 6 When the Pharaoh arrives at the Duat (Dew-at) he is only beginning his journey. He tunnels his way through the various 12 ‘hours’ or halls of the Duat where he encounters numerous gods who all play a role in “opening the ways” for the Pharaoh. He sees the Ben Ben , the ship of the gods. All of his experiences are geared toward helping him attain the power to emerge from the Duat."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 222 As if he is on some form of psychadelic trip, in the eleventh hour the Pharaoh meets the “Star Lady” and “Star Lord” whose attendant gods and goddesses are charged with equipping the Pharaoh for his upcoming “trip over the sky.” In the company of some gods the Pharaoh enters a “Serpent” inside which he is to “shed the skin” and emerge “in the form of a rejuvenated Ra.” Having entered the Serpent as a man, he emerges as a Falcon (a bird or bard), “equipped as a god.” The Pharaoh now “lays down on the ground the Mshdt -garment”; he puts on his back the “Mark- garment”; he “takes his divine Shuh -vestment” (the Cloak of Light or Robe of Glory?) and he puts on the “collar of beloved Horus” which is like “a collar on the neck of Ra” (and the Blue Stones at the neck of Mari). Fully attired “the king has established himself there as a god, like them.” He’s good to go. Ready to launch. And he says so to the god beside him: “If thou goest to Heaven so will the king go to Heaven.” The king is next led through a hidden door that opens to a tunnel called “Dawn at the End”. The tunnel opens to a vestibule decorated with the Winged Disk emblem. He is given new instructions by the goddesses present who “shed light upon the road of Ra.” A scepter representing Seth, the watcher leaves the Pharaoh awestruck.

The connection between"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 231 the ship and the Stairway is made in the Egyptian word khet , which means “steps” and also “ship’s mast”. The mast of the ship is the Stairway to Heaven, because the ship itself is the conduit between Earth and Heaven. It would be impossible to conclude this book without first noting that Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) placed a dodecahedron between Mars and Jupiter in his ingenious model of the solar system. Curiously, this is the location of the asteroid belt, which may be the debris field from the exploded planet called Tiamat or Mare . Called the Watery Dragon of Chaos or the Great Mother Goddess of Wisdom, depending upon the story, she was a great ship that suffered an Atlantis-like, or Yaldabaoth-like fate, sinking into the dark waters of the night. A thousand things could have doomed Tiamat. Sumerian myth says it was the satellites of the jealous marauding planet called the Nibiru that split Tiamat in half. One half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The other half reformed into Earth. The editors of the monumental Chicago Assyrian Dictionary have located and compiled all the places where the word “nibiru” and related forms of that word occur in Sumerian tablets. ! Nibiru has an assortment of meanings, all connected to the core idea of “ crossing ” or being some sort of “ crossing marker ” or “ crossing point ”. ! The “root idea” of the nibiru word group and its forms almost always means something like “crossing” or “gate.” “Let Nibiru be the holder of the crossing place of heaven and earth ,” says one text. In the Gilgamesh epic, for example, we read the line (later reprised by Jesus in the beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount): “Straight is the"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 232 crossing point (the nibiru ; a gateway), and narrow is the way that leads to it.” ! “ Ferry, ford”; “ferry boat”; “(act of) ferrying” are also definitions of Nibiru. When the accumulated meanings of Nibiru are tabulated we may interpret this word as referring to a “star, gate, crossing point” that enables one to Yalda-baoth “ pass through to her ” (Sophia, the Pleroma). Nibiru is the Bridging Plane(t), connecting the material, mortal side of humanity with our higher spiritual immortal nature. On the other side of this bridge is wondrous Garden of Eden or Field of the Blessed, the hundreds of billions of galaxies, similar to our own, that comprise the known universe. In this light Tiamat’s planetary matter represents fragments of a mystery of the shattered Feminine Wisdom, of Sophia. Her story, examined in detail in my book Ark of the Christos , is the Atlantis story in the stars. Enki came to Earth on a rescue mission immediately after this cataclysm. In Gnostic Christian myth Sophia (Tiamat) sent Christ to Earth in the form of a dove, the symbol of Tiamat and of the Oracle, to enter into Jesus at his baptism to rescue the souls...from the doomsday cataclysm of Tiamat/Atlantis, the Great Mother goddess who had descended into matter (in the form of Yaldabaoth). Jesus was considered the incarnation of Gnosis or knowledge. Myth says that before her sinking Tiamat placed the Tablets of Creation on the Moon. These tablets were later brought to Earth by Enki who used them in the creation of the human body. As we have seen, these Stones correspond with the Blue Stones or Divine Particles of Sophia."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 233 According to Madame H.P. Blavatsky, who reintroduced Eastern esotericism to the western mind at the beginning of the 20 th century, the five-pointed star emblem of the Perfect Man, the Oracle, had been ‘emblematically transformed into a crocodile’, which was sometimes called the Makara (a pun on Maker ), and was shown as a serpent . 7 Here, we are assured, we are on to one of the deepest secrets of arcane symbolism. To reveal this Big Arcane Secret requires that we answer the question: Why does the pentagrammal Perfect Man or Oracle symbol transform into a crocodile or Ser- Pent? Does this relate to the Labyrinth at Crocodopolis in the Gnostic Hymn of the Pearl ? One answer comes from the Egyptian term for crocodile, messias , which is the root for the Hebrew term messiah, ‘the perfect man’. As Laurence Gardner point out, it is from the words Messeh that the Hebrew stem MSSH derived. When vowels are added to this stem it forms the verb mashiach (to anoint) and the noun ( Messiah ), which means ‘Anointed One’ – i.e. the Christ, Christos, Messiah who comes from the Maker (‘ Makara ’) . 8 Jesus achieved this status only after being anointed by Mari Magdalene, the ‘woman who knew the All’ and the anointing oil (‘all’ in a Tennessee accent.) The Maya also had the concept of the Axis Mundi, or World Tree, but in addition, they had a Crocodile Tree representing our galaxy -- the Milky Way, and they visited Hunab Ku -- the galactic center, which lies in the mouth of the crocodile (or dark rift as we call it)."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 234 It is no big secret that the Perfect Man becomes so by being anointed (‘baptized’) in the wisdom of Sophia. Surely, this is not the Big Arcane Secret of Blavatsky. In my opinion, the Big Arcane Secret of the Makara (as well as of Tiamat and and Yaldabaoth) is that it was considered a bridge to other realms. MAKARA is the ‘ Ford Maker ’ or ‘Bridge Builder’ of Indian tradition. This is exactly how the Sumerians defined Nibiru. Blavatsky states that Makara (Nibiru) is the Gnostic Chozzar, another name for Chnoubis who converts the sphere into a dodecagonal pyramid . 9 Makara (‘maker’) was portrayed as a sea monster that was an intermediary between Earth and Heaven.

As we have seen, Con or kon means serpent (as we have seen in the word Canah , Mayan for great serpent). This is why a ring , especially the con -centric circle , symbolizes the serpent and also the gate. From this I conclude that the Big Arcane Secret is the method of transforming our consciousness to that of the Oracle and comprehending the secrets of the Ship of Life . The oil, I believe, is a secretion from the pineal gland that ignites the 12 cranial nerves. These secretions make us aware that we are all holographic fragments of the Source, , and prepare our consciousness for At-one-ment with the Ship. I have presented several Sumerian cylinder seals depicting gods appearing between two mountains or a gate.

CHAPTER SIX: REALM OF THE ILLUMINATI We will explore more of his concepts of the Pleroma momentarily. For the moment, it is important to note that Jung had two points of convergence with the ideas we have explored. First, according to biographer Richard Noll in The Aryan Christ: The Secret Life of Carl Jung, Jung claimed he became the lion-headed god in a visionary ecstasy in December 1913. Second, on page six of his book Word and Image, edited by Aniela Jaffe, is a copy of the Jung family crest. The caption reads: “The crest originally bore a phoenix, or according to another version, a butterfly crawling out of its cocoon. Both emblems would suggest the idea of youth (jung = “young”). C.G. Jung’s grandfather altered the crest. A BLUE CROSS and a BLUE CLUSTER OF GRAPES symbolized the heavenly and the terrestrial spirit, and the unifying symbol is the star, which evokes the alchemists’ gold.” (All caps mine.)"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"ORACLE OF THE ILLUMINATI 244 1.
