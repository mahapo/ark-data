CHRIST’S COURT “Her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal...” 1 Many, perhaps most, who see the title of this book, will wonder to what the ‘crystal halls of Christ’s Court’ refer. In the Book of Revelation, 2 his heavenly city is described as a perfect crystal cube descending out of heaven: “Her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal... And the city lieth foursquare... the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.” 3 The Bible does not provide the reason why the royal court of Christ is made of crystal, or why it is cube shaped. However, we can assume that this description was not arbitrary. It was the eyewitness account of a prophet named John. Another prophet, Enoch, who previously visited the court of Christ, corroborates this description. The Book of Enoch 4 gives a graphic account of the scribe’s experience of being taken on a journey to the ‘seventh heaven’ to meet with the Lord in a ‘house’ built of ‘crystals’ and encircled by a strange vibrating flame with ‘tongues of fire’ that struck him with terror. As Enoch approaches the heavenly"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 2 realm, he gazes out over ‘the treasures of the snow and ice’ and he sees ‘a very great sea, greater than the earthly sea’. The Lord, himself, sat on a ‘lofty throne’ of ‘crystal’. The poetic term the ‘seventh heaven’ came from the ancient belief that the Earth was surrounded by seven celestial spheres that were arranged like a seven-story mountain. The Church officially listed the seven heavens as: aerial, ethereal, Olympian the heaven of fire, the heave n of stars, the crystalline, and the Empyrean. 5 Christ was said to dwell in the seventh heaven, the Empyrean. The name Empyrean means “Heaven of Inner Fire” or “empire of the Sun god.” 6 It was also called the ‘Isle of Fire’, or the Central Sun, which I refer to as the Healing Sun, because the ‘fires’, frequencies or vibration s emanating from this place are believed to have healing qualities. Its location is the center of our Milky Way galaxy (more on this later). Like Christ, Enoch is considered to have a dual nature - - spiritual and physical, or heavenly and earthly. His story , including that of the seventh heaven and its Central Healing Sun must be interpreted on at least those two levels. To consider one without the other is a mistake. In addition, some researchers believe that to consider Enoch as a single man is also a mistake. Instead, Enoch is a generic title applied to and held by whole groups of individuals. In general these individuals were ‘learned’, the ‘initiated, or ‘seers,’ which means roughly “adept in the hidden secrets”. The myths and scripture we will investigate support the idea that this elite priesthood pas sed along secrets about the crystal halls of an inner world... Christ’s Court."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 3 The Empyrean. ( From Dante’s The Divine Comedy) The abode of God appears to Dante as a blinding point of light. The Rosicrucians consider this the Central Sun. It is the Healing Sun."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 4 Some writers -- especially Masons -- identify Enoch with Thoth, the Egyptian god of healing and inventor of writing. This is key. Thoth’s name is derived from Tuattes , meaning roughly ‘Lord of the Inner World’ or the Tuat . In Egypt, the Tuat had an analog in the material world. Known as the ‘ Place of Ascending ’, 7 it was accessed through a glass ‘mound’ we call the Great Pyramid. According to the Egyptian legend, Thoth came to Egypt from a land to the west that was across an ocean. Its capitol was by the sea. This land was referred to as the “Island of Flame which is in the sea,” 8 and was the home of the gods. This description matches Enoch’s report of the seventh heaven. A terrible cataclysm occurred which blackened the sun and disrupted the gods, but Thoth led his people to the safety of an eastern country. He rallied the newly formed Egyptian civilization around the construction of the Great Pyramid, which has been referred to by ancient historians as the ‘Pillar of Enoch’. 9 Nearly everyone interested in spiritual mysteries has heard of the tantalizing legend of the Hall of Records beneath the Sphinx and Great Pyramid on the Giza plateau in Egypt. Thoth’s elite priesthood, sages opine, concealed immensely powerful knowledge about the origins and destiny of humanity within the subterranean halls of the Giza plateau. Evidence that something is buried there comes from the mysterious Coffin Texts where the ancient Egyptians told of a ‘sealed thing’ with ‘fire about it’ concealed beneath th e ‘desert of sand’. 10 According to legend, the doorway leading to the Hall of Records was to remain sealed for a future time -- a time when humanity would once again"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 5 enter a Golden Age. At that time the Hall would open and the secret teachings of the ages would be revealed. “As Above. So Below” is one of the best known of all metaphysical truths. It is attributed to Thoth. Essentiall y this means that what occurs in the heavens also occurs on Earth. This is plainly stated in the Lord’s Prayer, “thy will be done, as in Heaven, so in Earth.” 11 According to this law, Thoth’s Hall of Records, like Enoch and Christ, must be one part earthly and one part heavenly. Thoth raises Osiris from the dead with the Key of Life."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 6 Because of increasing materialism, say esoteric schools, the Mystery Temples, including the Hall of Records, were removed from the physical plane, but they continued to exist on the etheric or spiritual realm. Prophecies of many traditions say that they will again be restored in their material form. When this occurs the cube-shaped ‘New Jerusalem’ will come out of the sky and a new ‘superhuman’ will emerge who will demonstrate the powers of the gods. Enoch’s journey into the ethereal realms reminds us that in order to apprehend the secrets of the gods and Christ’s Court it must be understood that the Earth is surrounded by layers or sheaths of increasing tenuosity. These layers extend outward into space and inward into the mind. The finest layers are composed of astral, mental and spiritual substances. According to esoteric teaching, Christ’s Court once had its densest expression in the ethers above the city of Jerusalem (‘city of Peace’). When it returns as the N e w Jerusalem it will be in another location. Here will be revealed the secrets of walking the crystal halls of Christ’ s Court. The location of the New Jerusalem, and how to connect with Christ’s Court are vital questions. A powerful clue to all that would seek Thoth’s Hall and the secrets of the New Jerusalem is provided by Thoth’s name. Thoth is the likely root of the English thought . According to Masonic legend, Thoth possessed all secret sacred knowledge on 36,525 scrolls that were hidden under the heavenly vault (the stars). 12 This ‘Thought Sphere’ is literally all around us."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 7 However, it could only be found by the pure in heart that would use it for the benefit of all humanity. In The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind , 13 neurologist Julian Jaynes hypothesizes that as far back as 12,000 years ago, the time of the ‘sinking’ of Atlantis, human consciousness was altered by a catastrophic trauma. In early myths Jaynes found references to the gods speaking in our heads as if they occupied our brains. The Egyptians called them the Neter , the Hebrews called them the Nephilim , the Greeks called them the Titans , and in the Vedic tradition, they were called the Asuras . He isolated a relatively dormant area of the right brain, Wernicke’s area, as the likely broadcast source. We lost this connection (to Thoth’s Thought Sphere) after the catastrophe, which many ancient myths blame on the gods. In actuality, these gods, who had been invoked by human beings for the accomplishment of tasks, were the mirrors of human thought and action. When we reconnect with the omnipresent Thought Sphere, we reconnect with the gods and their secrets. Thoth’s law assures us that these secrets are hidden within us. Apart from the Thought Sphere, some say that the real treasure of Thoth’s Hall is an entrance to a subterranean kingdom linked to the far corners of the Earth by a network of tunnels. Plato, who introduced the Atlantis idea to the western world, speaks of mysterious passageways of the once mighty Atlantis, ‘tunnels both broad and narrow, in the interior of the Earth’ that served as refuges of the Atlantean apocalypse. He further tells of a great ruler ‘who sits in the center, on the navel of the Earth; and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind’."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 8 Tales of a global cataclysm, mysterious ‘caves’, entrances to a subterranean (or submerged) world and powerful spirits and gods who dwell in the Inner Earth -- a separate world from ours -- are found the world over. Often stories tell of men who, like the German Tannhauser, found the mountain of the love goddess Venus and dwell in the paradise of the goddess. The Welsh stories of King Arthur who lives in the heart of a crystal or ‘glass mountain’, and the Jewish legend of Abraham and Sarah coming upon Thoth in suspended animation in a ‘cave’ all speak of magical inner spaces accessed through a cave in a mountain. This mountain is the ‘peak of the precious stone’, the ‘mountain of gold’, the ‘home of the gods’, the ‘mount of salvation’. Many prefer to see the Great Pyramid as the cave of the gods and the mountain of salvation. However, the Giza wonder is a copy of an original glass or crystal mountain called Ida located elsewhere. According to legend, ancient god beings the Egyptians called Saba originally dwelled at a place called Mero (Egyptian), Shambhala (Tibetan), Meru (Hindu) or Tula (Greek and Mexican). Within this complex was found the mysterious Mt. Ida. Interestingly, Ida was also known as Mount Id-Avratta . 14 This mountain became Ida-Ararat , or simply Ida or Ararat. Meru is the Ararat of the Hindus. This is intriguing since Ararat is where ‘Noah’s Ark’ came to rest. Noah’s ark was cube-shaped. His name comes from Nu or Nuah, meaning ‘knowledge’. In myth, Mt. Ida- Arrarat is considered the repository where all knowledge once originated. In fact, Ida is the root for our English word idea ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 9 Along with Mt. Ida, on the top of Mount Meru or Tula of the Hindus was the Mount of Saba, or of the congregation or heavenly host. Meru/Tula was known as the Garden of Eden to the Hindus, and is the place where the original Egyptian gods assembled. 15 As we will investigate later, the Saba were expert in the use of Quartz crystal. In Tibetan tradition they hid secret teachings in diamond rocks, in mysterious lakes, and in unchanging boxes that were magically closed until a special time in history. Many texts were compressed in these diamond rocks or crystals similar to the way information is inscribed onto and ‘hidden’ in modern microchips or memory sticks. The Egyptian Edfu Texts tell us that the outer corridor of the Egyptian Hall of Records was known as the arrit - hall. 16 Obviously, a r r i t and a r r a r a t are quite close phonetically. In addition, harit is Sanskrit for ‘light’. Does this suggest Mt. Ida is an external entranceway or crystalline gateway to a larger crystalline hall... of light? If the ‘diamond rocks’ and ‘crystalline gateway’ the Saba ‘projected’ massive amounts of data into at Mt. Ida were Quartz crystal this would be extraordinary. Of all the Mt. Idas’ in the world -- and there are several in lands considered holy to its inhabitants including Central Asia, Turkey and Australia -- only Mt. Ida, Arkansas has Quartz crystal. More fantastically, could Noah’s long lost Ararat be Ida, and could Mt. Ida, Arkansas be the original Hall of Records? Was knowledge of their connection forgotten as this story was passed along through the ages? Could the Quartz crystal of Mt. Ida, Arkansas really be a secret"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 10 repository of knowledge seekers have long sought? Is secret knowledge concerning Christ’s crystal court hidden in America? One of the most remarkable things we will learn as this investigation unfolds is that, if Mt. Ida, Arkansas is the Id a of myth, it is part of a much larger complex which may be described as a “docking station,” or connecting point, between Heaven and Earth. One of the key features of the Meru or Ida complexes was a pillar or ‘ladder’ reaching into Heaven. Through this pillar the crystal halls of Meru or Ida do indeed link to the Crystal Halls of Christ’s Court. One of Egypt’s oldest names was Ta-Mera -- “Land of Love.” When we search Ta-Mera for Meru myths we learn that the ancient Egyptian gods constructed a Pillar at Meroe , a royal necropolis or city of the dead whose place name is phonetically close to Meru . Do we find anything remotely similar when we search America? Indeed we do. One the opposite page is a depiction of mystic Mount Meru, the “dwelling of the immortals,” from a second century Chinese manuscript. Beside it is a line drawing of the Tennessee Capitol Mall complex constructed in 1997 in Nashville, Tennessee to commemorate Tennessee’s Bicentennial. As I discussed in my book City of Peace: The Holy Grail Secrets of Ancient and Modern Nashville , the two complexes are amazingly similar. Provocatively, Nashville’s original name was the Mero district. In myth the Meru pillar is an antenna or accumulator of healing energy. Does the construction of this complex in Nashville suggest that the Meru archetype, that is the dwelling place of the immortals, the New Jerusalem, is being replicated in America?"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 11 \u0001 In Asia the cosmic pillar Mount Sumeru (left) was depicted as the link between man and God. The Tennessee Capitol Mall (right) is amazingly similar in design. I am not the first to connect America to the secrets of the ancients. The lack of Quartz crystal at Mt.

Meru’s Buddhist name, ‘Sumeru’, obviously rings of Shumer , Sumer or Sumeria , present-day Iraq, and the ancient home of the An-un-naki, the Sumerian name for a group of god beings who are mirror images of the Saba. A great scholarly debate exists as to whether or not the original home of these gods was in Sumeria in present day Iraq, Sumeru in Asia, in Egypt or even another place altogether. Map of the world with Meru over America. As the accompanying map taken from New Light From The Great Pyramid by Albert Ross Parsons in 1893 clearly shows, 17 Meru was believed by some initiates to have been in America! On the map, Mr. Parsons even demonstrates his belief that the word A-meri-ca was derived from Meru, Meroe, Moriah, Amerak, and Amerique ."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 13 THE ATLANTIS-AMERICA CONNECTION If America was the original landing place of the gods this would be quite interesting. Here’s why. In addition to America, Atlantis was also associated with the name Meru. America has long been called the New Atlantis. In fact, ‘America is the New Atlantis’ has been a guiding esoteric myth in the development of the America. The Hindu religion states that Mount Meru was originally located in Mongolia. This is fascinating since t he myths of the Maya, Toltecs and Aztecs tell of bearded, blond white men who came from a kingdom in Mongolia called Tollan or Tula located near Lake Baikal and the river Tula. These Mongolians said they had come from Atlantis and sailed around the world founding new Tulas, naming them after their homeland. 18 Throughout the ancient and the modern world myths have circulated about the goings on at Meru. These myths center around the belief in the existence of a “hidden directorate” of god-beings, the Saba, who dwell in this remote region of Asia. 19 The Mayan, Egyptian and Mongolian traditions tell of a group of beings who travel the cosmos carrying teachings for aligning worlds with the Central Healing Sun, 20 where the ancients believe our souls originated. In Greek and Mayan myth the Central Sun is also called Tula. ‘Peace’ on Earth is created when the Tulas on Earth and the Tula in Heaven are aligned. These god-beings do not define ‘peace’ as the absence of petty conflict between"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 14 warring tribes, jealous religions or families. Rather, “Peace” is the unity of Heaven and Earth. Mayan prophecy states Peace will be created in December 2012 . Coincidentally, in Revelation 20:12 , John tells us: “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key (out) of the bottomless pit.” The ‘bottomless pit’ is Earth. We can learn a lot about what may be to come in 2012 by studying the ancient events surrounding these people of Saba and their creation of Cities of Peace in the ancient world. This idea that an ancient myth is re-enacting itself in our sophisticated modern world may sound absurd to some. However, to the ancient Egyptians who modeled this process before us, this was serious business. The idea of establishing Peace was necessary for the perpetuation of humanity. Failure to recreate the correct myth and ritual, and to establish the link between Heaven and Earth, was suicidal since it resulted in Chaos. The ‘Sleeping Prophet’ Edgar Cayce was another who connected America to the myth of the New Jerusalem or the New Atlantis. He also placed great emphasis on the revelation of the knowledge concealed within Thoth’s Hall, linking it with the salvation of humanity. He pointed to Atlantis as the original land of provenance of this knowledge. Cayce was a high-level Mason who drew upon ancient Mystery School traditions to make his prophecies. He prophesied a time when Earth changes and Chaos would devastate the world. Afterwards, a “true Americanism, the universal thought that is expressed and manifested in the brotherhood of man, as in the Masonic"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 15 order, will be the eventual rule in the settlement of the affairs of the world.” 21 ‘America’, both spiritually and literally speaking, will ‘rule’ the world. Originally an occult organization dedicated to the transmission of secret sacred knowledge, Freemasonry is traced to the Knights Templar, 22 the Knights of Christ who recovered and preserved secrets once housed beneath Solomon’s Temple atop Mount Moriah ( M e r u ) in Jerusalem. A controversial history of the Templar maintains that they were founded by a mysterious secret society called the Priory of Sion (meaning ‘Sun’). Fascinatingly, upon election, each grand master of the Priory of Sion takes the name John or Joan. Like the name Enoch, John (Joannes, Jonas) represents a person(s) imbued with a certain skill or wisdom. Because they venerated a hidden god symbolized by a severed head they called Sophia (Greek for ‘wisdom’), the Templars are most closely associated with John the Baptist, who was decapitated. In order to fully appreciate the significance of this title, ‘John’, we must first tie a Gordian knot between the Templars and the Arabians who called Enoch Idris . The Arabs say that Idris was the same as Elijah, who did not die, but rather, was translated to Heaven in a whirlwind from atop Mount Moriah (Meru). Thus the Jewish and the Arabian traditions unite Enoch (who is Thoth) and Elijah. I suppose everyone who reads this will remember that the Jews are said to have believed Jesus to be Elijah. 23 However, Jesus declared John the Baptist came in the Spirit and power of Elijah. 24 John was the precursor or pre- possessor of Divine Wisdom, which is Gnosis . His"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 16 followers claimed he was sent from the world of light ( harit ). The Holy Wisdom was incarnate in him, and he transmitted it to Jesus. The Sanskrit word for Gnosis or wisdom was Jnana , which with the addition of an ‘o’ becomes Jon -ana. 25 This gives a powerful clue to all the mysterious Johns, including the followers of John the Baptist, among whose ranks Jesus recruited his first disciples, including the ‘beloved disc iple’ John, 26 the disciple who was closest to the heart of Christ, on whom Jesus leaned at the Last Supper, and who never knew death. 27 Christ was said to have delivered a secret initiation to this John, whose initiatory name was Lazarus . He brought the Holy Grail into the “upper room” at the Last Supper. Later, another John, called the Divine, wandered into the crystal halls of Christ’s Court and became known as John the Revelator. The adoption of the priestly name John by its grand masters points to the Priory of Sion as a continuation of the ancient line of priests of John. The Priory is apparently a modern bridge between the priestly line of Thoth/Enoch(s), who became the Elijah(s), and the John the Baptist(s). John’s Gospel is the most Gnostic (‘wisdom bearing’). This has lead this book to be set apart from the other three Gospels. Its source was the devoted followers of John the Baptist, who were called Mandaeans, and about whom the Gospels have very little to say. The Mandaeans are often called the Christians of Saint John, as he is held as a very sacred person, but not indispensable, in their theology. They claim to belong to a religion older than Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The trail of their origins leads to"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 17 Mesopotamia. Their name is Aramaic for ‘knowledge’, i.e. a translation from the Greek ‘gnosis’. It is highly important to acknowledge that an alternative name for the Mandaeans was the Saba . “Sabian” is a word derived from the Aramaic-Mandic verb “ Saba ” which means “baptized” or “dyed”, “immersed in water”. Thus, “Mandaean Sabians” means those who are baptized in the knowledge of God and who know the religion of God. The full import of this connection will be made later. The Mandaeans fled Jerusalem and settled in Iraq shortly after the Crucifixion, in order to escape the persecution of Paul and the Romans. The Mandaeans still exist in Iraq today. They conduct baptism in the river, and have special handshakes and rituals said to resemble those of modern Freemasonry. They are often linked with the Essenes, who echoing the story of Thoth, believed that good souls reside beyond the ocean to the west. For the Mandaeans this land was so perfect that mortal eyes cannot see it. A star called Merica , that sits in the sky above it marks this Holy Land. 28 The reference to Merica is astounding, particularly for the fact that it ties-in with the lore surrounding the Templar’s head. The secret Templar ‘head’ of John ( Jnana, wisdom, or Jnosis ) became public knowledge in the early 1300’s during the Inquisition, the monstrous tribunal (dea th squad) organized by the Catholic Church to torture heretics . In 1308 the Pope rounded up the Templars for their beliefs concerning this head. The ‘head’ and its amazing abilities were described in the list of charges brought against the Templars: “ ...that they said the head could save them. That it could make riches, make the trees flower, and make the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 18 land germinate .” Thousands of Templar were executed. They would sooner die than reveal the secret of this symbol. The exact nature of this ‘head’ has long been contested. One thing is certain. It performs exactly the same function as the Holy Grail. Because it brings riches and makes the trees flower this ‘head’ also appears to be a key to the secrets of nature. Based upon this description, we may safely speculate that this skull is a clever symbol for a skill , the Skill or Wisdom of God contained in the Thought Sphere, the crystal sticks of Ida, and the Hall of Records. What became of this wisdom or skill? On Friday October 13, 1308 the massive Templar fleet, purportedly stowing the secret treasure of Solomon’s Temple, vanished into the night. Researchers trace their path to Scotland where the Sinclair family became guardians of the enormous Templar treasure. Prince Henry Sinclair, a Templar who had previously gone on a crusade to Alexandria, 29 the intellectual center of the world, took control of the Templar fleet. He visited Nova Scotia in 1398. The Micmac Indians greeted him when he arrived. When he asked them where he was, they replied ‘Fertile Land’. In Micmac this was ‘Acadia’. In European mythology ‘Arcadia’ was “the Promised Land,” and was equated with Atlantis. A cipher found in 1891 at Rennes-le- Chateau, France and bearing the phrase “Et in Arcadia Ego” said that the secrets of God, or Jesus, were hidden in Arcadia. Some believe Sinclair transported these secrets t o North America for future discovery. John the Baptist came from ‘the wilderness’ and announced that the Kingdom of God was at hand. He was"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 19 widely thought to be Elijah returned, as the prophet Malachi had foretold: “Behold, I will send Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible Day of the Lord. And he shall turn (‘tune’?) the heart of the fathers to the children” 30 (my comment in parenthesis). Could America be the fertile Arcadian ‘wilderness’, the westerly Essene/Mandaean/Sabaean paradise Merica from which John the Baptist departed for his meeting with Jesus in Jerusalem? Is the Tennessee Capital Mall the recreated antenna or ‘tuner’ the baptists or Saba used to channel the healing vibrations emanating from Christ’s Court? A noteworthy and controversial archaeological find that addresses this question is the Bat Creek Stone, discovered in 1889 in an undisturbed burial mound in Eastern Tennessee by the Smithsonian’s Mound Survey project. The Bat Creek Stone. Today it resides out of sight in a back room of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 20 In 1971, Hebrew scholar Cyrus Gordon identified the letters inscribed on the stone as Paleo-Hebrew of approximately the first or second century AD. According to him, the five letters to the left of the comma-shaped word divider read, from right to left, LYHWD, or “for Judea.” 31 In 1988, wood fragments found with the inscription were Carbon-14 dated to somewhere between 32 AD and 769 AD. These dates are consistent with the apparent date of the letters. Dr. Robert Stieglitz of New York dated the stone to the first century AD. 32 He reads the inscription as “A comet for the Jews,” with reference to Hailey’s Comet, which “hung over Jerusalem like a flaming sword” in the year 69 AD, during the First Revolt, begun in 68 under Nero. “The evidence” writes Dr. Fell, “suggests that Kentucky and Tennessee became havens of refuge for persecuted Hebrews after the various revolts against Syria n Greek and Roman oppression.” 33 There is great controversy over the age of the Bat Creek Stone. First, and most importantly, bracelets found in the same burial mound date to the 18-19th century -- meaning that the stone probably didn’t find its way into the mound until then (so it could have easily been brought over after Columbus, the “official” discoverer of America). “Recent tests by our Conservation Laboratory on the brass bracelets found in the same grave definitely established that they are 18-19th century trade goods and do not have the chemical composition of brass of the Roman or early Semitic periods.” 34 This does not definitively negate the early date of the Bat Creek stone.

The dispersion of sacred texts occurred when the Jews rebelled against the Roman occupation. “The Jewish War,” as it is termed by Flavius Josephus, a military commander and historian of the era, was provoked by the Romans’ insistence that their insignia – the eagle – and statues be allowed into Jerusalem and the holy temple of Solomon. At this the Jews revolted because of their prohibition against idolatry. They eventually were defeated and surrounded at the fortress of Masada. Almost a thousand Jews took their own lives rather than accept Roman symbols in the holy places, believing that they had thus cheated the Romans of their victory and would rise again at a future bodily resurection. 35 The Roman emperor Nero, who ordered this attack, was interested in more than just the real estate of Jerusalem. Detailed accounts tell of the deployment of his son Titus to recover the Ark of the Covenant, which was housed at Solomon’s Temple atop Mount Moriah (or Meru). Awaiting the Romans at the Temple were the zealous Nazarenes. They are believed to have taken drastic measures to hide the scrolls containing secret teachings an d other artifacts. Some of these scrolls are believed to have belonged to Jesus. They are believed to have hidden them in a vault beneath the Temple and in the numerous caves in the hill country of Qumran, near Jerusalem and on the rocky cliff at Masada.

It is still a mystery as to exactly what treasure was taken from the Temple and if it ended up at Masada. Hebrew legend maintains that some of the followers of John the Baptist, the Mandaeans or Saba, were among the faithful at Masada. Some of these Mandaeans escaped with the secret teachings of John and Jesus. Is the Bat Creek stone a reference to the survival of these treasures in East Tennessee? Did John’s followers return them to the land of their origin? Incredibly, an early Nashville archaeologist, Dr. Joseph Jones, hints that the s ite of the Tennessee Capital Mall was once a ceremonial center of the Mandan Indians. 36 The Mandan were “white Indians” conversant in the Welsh tongue, English. Their name, Mandan, is exactly the same as Mandaean . The Mandan claimed to be descended from a white man who came in a big canoe, which their oral tradition said had come to rest on a high mountain after a great flood that destroyed everything on Earth. A symbolical representatio n of this canoe occupied a religious shrine in their public square. It was a tall pillar. This is all the more remarkable inasmuch as the plains-dwelling Mandans had little use for canoes, and their own watercraft were primitive, round “bullboats” of wicker covered with hides, used only for crossing rivers. The legend also related how a dove, sent out in search of dry land, returned with a willow twig in its beak. Similarities to the Biblical account of Noah’s flood seemed too close to be coincidental.

A Mer-Ka-Ba hovers above a pillar. Notice the ‘serpent’ flying nearby. The presence of this document at Masada suggests that the Essenes, including the Mandaeans (Mandans?), joined the revolutionaries at Masada and took with them their manuscripts, or that the rebels occupied the Qumran area after its evacuation by the Essenes and subsequently transferred Essene manuscripts to their final place of resistance.

THE CRYSTAL SKULL Throughout the ages initiates have made an effort to connect the Hall of Records lore of Thoth/Enoch (Elijah/John) with the mystery teachings of Jesus. As we have seen, Thoth raised Osiris, who was decapitated and whose head symbolized wisdom, from the dead. Jesus raised Lazarus, or L’Osiris, whose name John means wisdom. Many readers will be unaware that, like Thoth, Jesus was portrayed using a wand-like device that the Egyptians called the Key of Life to facilitate the raising of Lazarus. This ‘key’ is a tone, frequency, vibration or note. In Egyptian legend it was originally brought to Earth from the Central Healing Sun by the heron, a bird that was interchanged with the phoenix as the symbol of the Egyptian savior. It is worth noting that the word phoenix often ascribed to Jesus is supposed to have come from the Egyptian word Pa-Hanoch , which means ‘House of Henoch or Enoch ’ (and refers to the Great Pyramid). The German Grail poet Wolfram labeled the Holy Grail as the Phoenix Stone. He also called it lapsit excillis , the “Philosopher’s Stone”. “By the power of that stone that the p h o e n i x burns to ashes, but the ashes give him life"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 26 again ...Such power does the stone give a man that flesh and bones are made young again.

Vatican Museum"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 27 I will refer to this stone as the Phoenix Stone or the Christ Stone. However, we must remember that in reality this Stone is composed of tones, rays, or vibrations from the Central Healing Sun at the core of our galaxy where is located the crystal halls of Christ’s Court. In fact the word ‘Christ’ is but ‘ Choir -ist’, meaning a group of singers or dancers, especially in divine service, in a church. In their book In Search of the Holy Grail and the Precious Blood , 1 Ean and Deike Begg tell of the bizarre graffiti found in the chateau at Domme, France, where Knights Templar were imprisoned after the persecution by the Church in 1308. Here is found a depiction of the Crucifixion that is slightly twisted from the accepted Church version (or the Church version is twisted from the original event). Joseph of Arimathea (Jesus’ wealthy uncle ) is shown catching precious droplets of Jesus’ (royal blue) blood (presumably with the Holy Grail). On Jesus’ left is a pregnant woman holding a wand (a r o d or r a y ). This woman is presumed to be Mary Magdalene, Jesus’ chief disciple, and his wife, according t o the Grail heresy. If Thoth and Enoch are members of the same priesthood, we may hypothesize that the sacred skill most closely guarded by their priesthood(s) is that of the Grail, which is the song of keys of Central Healing Sun, and the ability of these rays to regenerate life. Jesus recovered an d implemented this knowledge. He apparently shared it with Mary Magdalene. One source of this knowledge was John the Baptist and his Mandaean priesthood. Mandaean and Templar clues points to Merica as the repository for this knowledge. However, it is vital to"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 28 operate from the premise that this skill is also within each of us. As Mssrs. Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln keenly observed in Holy Blood, Holy Grail , if one breaks the French word sangraal , “holy grail,” after the ‘g’ it renders the word as sang raal , which means “Royal Blood” in Old French. 2 Sang raal is easily rendered as Song Grail , the Song or Key of Life. If one learns to attune the crystals in their blood (DNA) to the Holy Grail, or song Grail , ignorance disappears, enlightenment occurs. Thus, the Key of Life is a mystery teaching aimed at transforming human blood. Exoteric Christianity teaches that only Jesus possessed the royal blood or noble blood of Christ. As the Templars knew, this is a medical condition anyone can achieve. This belief is a rarely discussed facet of the Grail heresy. My hypothesis is that this noble blood gave one access to the Thought Sphere. It is potentially open to everyone. Along with the crystal halls of Christ’s Court, the Thought Sphere extends a welcome to all. MYSTIC UNION This book proposes that the ancients possessed a sacred science for entering the crystal halls of Christ’s Court. Th e caduceus featured in Thoth’s hand in the depiction above symbolized this science. The Essene Therapeutae, the priesthood of ‘physicians of the soul’ of which Jesus and John were members, adopted this symbol. The intertwined ‘snakes’ winding their way up the central rod represent the two universal polarities. Esotericists beli eve"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 29 fire and ice represent these polarities. Fire is frequency, vibration, or pressure. Ice is frozen or pressurized water. When the pressure of fire meets water crystal is formed. The word “crystal” is derived from the Greek word “krystallos”, meaning ice. This alchemical concept of the ‘crystallization’ of polarities is based on dualism. At the same time each human soul attempts to balance the male-female, light-dark polarities within, the sharp contrast between the lower world and God, the source of all being, the upper world is also occurring. Finally, comes the mystic union, or unio mystica . Since the soul by nature belongs to a higher world, its highest aim can only be to free itself from its earthly bonds and all that is connected with it in order to attain purification, or Catharsis . At the Crucifixion the two polarities, fire and water, male and female, often symbolized in Christian art by the sun and moon, were blended producing in their fusion a crystalline force, Christ (or Cryst). The new type of being produced by this force is biologically as well as spirituall y advanced. As we will explore later, these secrets were claimed to be in the possession of a group of pure souls who called themselves Cathars , or Pure Ones . They shared them with the Templars. With this great pulsating crystalline force ascending and descending throughout their anatomy the disciple become a holy one, a John or Joan, meaning a wisdom bearing ‘beloved disciple’ like John. Their brain is made new. They have achieved Christ or Grail Consciousness, the Christed mind symbolized by a Crystal Skull."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 30 According to lore, when the Grail, or the Head of God, is discovered and the Golden Age commences every inhabitant of the Earth will know and understand how the universe works. Everyone will have the ability to manifest a Crystal Skull and access the thought sphere. An age of miracles will begin. The Gnostic teachings are the key resources for affecting this transformation. Both the Egyptians and the early Christian Gnostics focused on the power of hidden divine words, names or keys to bring about healing, salvation and the Mystic Union. In Egyptian lore, when the heron or phoenix emerged from the Central Healing Sun it landed on top of the pyramid and from its outstretched arms radiated light (which split into seven rays). It then delivered a teaching, symbolized by the Key of Life , designed to transform the Egyptians into herons or birds of light. In the Pistis Sophia , Jesus told his disciples to “hide the mystery” of a great Name (or key) that could produce miracles. 3 In Revelation, 4 the Holy Spirit says to John: “ To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new Name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receive it .” I remind the reader that this ‘white stone’ is a ‘pure tone’ or the Key of Life. Later in Revelation, 5 John writes of the returning Christ as “ruling with a rod of iron ”: “ He hath on his THIGH a NAME written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords ”."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 31 In her book The Glastonbury Zodiac , Mary Caine relates a Jewish legend of the Middle Ages that shows a clear belief in a relationship between Jesus, the hidden Name or Key of Life and the Hall of Records. She writes: “ The Hidden Name (of God) was secretly inscribed in the innermost recesses of the Temple, guarded by a sculptured lion ”. The Temple, guarded by the sculptured lion, can be none other than the Great Pyramid. Ms. Caine continues, “ If, as was most likely, an intruder saw the name, the lion would give such a supernatural roar that all memory of it would be driven from his mind. But Jesus knew this; he evaded the lion, wrote the Name, cut his thigh open and hid it within the wound , closing it by magic. Once out of the Temple he re- opened the incision and took out the sacred letters ”. 6 The involvement of the Templars in preserving this Name is attested to in the coat of arms of their fortress town at Eze-s/mer (Alpes Maritimes), France. The arms of Eze- s/mer shows the phoenix reborn of a femur or thigh bone. 7 The Rosicrucians, a secret society that surfaced in France, Germany and England in the early 1620’s 8 are another group associated with these secrets. They have a provocative illustration that depicts Jesus as the center point of the Great Pyramid. The Rosicrucians claimed to be immortal beings from a superior race that possessed the Philosopher’s Stone and could converse with angels and make themselves invisible. 9 Is it possible that the ‘radiant fire’ of the sealed Hall of Records underneath the Giza plateau is a reference to the radiance of crystal?

Was the Great Pyramid the starting point for Enoch’s and John’s journey? Was it the cave in which Abraham and Sarah discovered the recumbent form of Thoth? Jesus atop a radiant pyramid. Interestingly, the ancient Egyptians called the Giza complex the Rose-tau or Ros -tau . 10 The Giza-Rostau complex was at the end of the ‘sacred road of the neters (gods),’ suggesting it was a passageway used by the gods to"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 33 enter the underworld (also called the Tuat). Here, the blessed dead would share the company of Osiris. 11 A powerful correspondence between the Crucifixion of Jesus and the Giza complex is found in the definition of the Greek word stau-ros . While unfamiliar to most modern Christians, it was the original Greek word used to describe the Cross upon which Jesus was crucified. It actually means the ‘pillar’. 12 The mirror image of Stau-ros is Ros-tau . In Egypt, Osiris was the Lord of Rostau. He was a god of gardening who was decapitated by his half-brother, Set. His head was housed in a pillar. Osiris’ pillar was considered the ladder to heaven. Its alternate name was the Pillar of Mero or Meru . This ‘ladder’ is a symbol of that which must be ascended in order to reach the Fields of Peace. The reconstruction of the Pillar of Osiris on the next page stood approximately 40 feet tall. At the top of the tall pole are two ‘tablets’ adorned with a uraei serpent. This element is intended to suggest its character as the “ head ” of Osiris. 13 Provocatively, the description of this pillar matches the Hebrew Mer-Ka-Ba and the ‘canoe’ of the Mandan."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 34 The Pillar of Osiris or Meru based upon representations in the Temple of Seti I at Abydos and elsewhere.

My research has led me to palladium as this material. Palladium is named after the Greek goddess Pallas-Athena , the Spear Shaker and goddess of wisdom. Greeks claimed she was born from the head or thigh of Zeus. In c. 300 AD the Palladium found its way to Rome. Roman legend says Aeneas, the son of Aphrodite brought it to Rome from Troy, installed it in the temple of Vesta, 14 and founded Rome with its help. 15 Like the Druids, Aeneas visited the underworld of the goddess, clutching the magic mistletoe branch that would insure his safe return to Earth. 16 The ‘branch of the mistletoe’ was the sacred magic wand made of ‘holly wood’ or ‘holy wood’ of the Druids. It is made from a branch of the Tree of Life, which is the Meru pillar."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 37 The Palladium had been in Troy ever since Apollo gave it to his daughter Chryses upon her marriage to Dardanus. Troy was a center of the Phrygians who were worshippers of Cybele or Sa-Ba-El, the Great Mother of Ida , also known as the Mother of All Living, 17 and who was equated with the alluring Isis, wife of Osiris. Ida was a great mountain in Anatolia. It was from Ida in Anatolia that the gods watched the battle over Troy. The Phrygians are a strange lot who said the original ancestor of their tribe was a great serpent who lived in a Tree of Life in the primordial garden, and begot the tribes called Ophiogenesis to whom he revealed the sacred mysteries of life. Plutarch said that Hebrew worshippers of this god in the first century BC called him Sabbi or Saba . 18 This affirms that the terms the Tree of Life, the Pillar of Osiris, the Meru Pillar, the Pillar of Saba, the Stau-Ros Pillar of the Crucifixion, and the Palladium are interchangeable. It also further links the Pillar’s occupa nt with the Saba, who became the priests of John the Baptist (the Mandaeans). One of the stories retelling the delivery of the Palladium from Troy to Rome describes it as a black stone. Also known as the bethula , or Vessel of Tula, the black stone is a symbol for the hidden teachings of the Saba. We will discuss this in detail later. In Rome the Palladium was operated by the famed Vestal Virgins, the sisterhood who were married to the spirit of Rome by an artificial phallus that was housed in a shrine called the Palladium where it signified AMOR, the secret name of ROMA in reverse. 19"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 38 The Vestal virgins who operated this Pillar were later called ‘nuns’ (from nana , mother) by the Catholic Church. The Vestals shunned sexual activity with men in order to become the Vestal brides of Christ. 20 ‘Nun’ has many levels of meaning, including being Hebrew for fish. Some scholars believe nuns were so called because they were ambivalent toward sex, like fish. However, as we have seen (on p. 23), the operators of the Palladium were depicted wearing fish suits. The nuns were neither fish nor virgins in the physical sense. “Their ‘marriage’ to the phallic deity of the Palladium,” says Barbara Walker, “was physically consummated in Vesta’s temple, under conditions of great secrecy.” 21 “The name of the god who is the son, lover and victim of the old Mother Goddess,” writes Robert Graves, “is not only Pallas, the sea-beast, but Salmoneus (Solomon) the human oak-king .” 22 I am not surprised by the secrecy involving this device. According to Walker, the ceremony was performed by the Vestals who used the Palladium Pillar as their ladder or bridge between worlds. Assisting them was a priest called the Pontifex Maximus, “great maker of the pons ,” which meant a bridge, a path or a way. 23 His role appears to have been to assist the Vestals in creating a ‘bridge’ between Father Heaven and Mother Earth. In other words they performed the Mystic Union. The Vestals were eradicated by the early Christian regimes of the 4th and 5th centuries. Apparently these regimes did not understand the power of the Pillar device or fully know how to make it operate. Or, perhaps they sought to consolidate their power. Therefore, they destroyed all"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 39 knowledge of its existence and practices along with removing the goddess from her place of exaltation. In their place they installed the tradition of nuns. The office of Pontifex was exalted by the Catholic Christians and remains to this day (though stripped of its original power) as the office of the ‘pontiff‘ or ‘pope’. Even to this day the pope wears a fish-head piece of headgear called a mitre . From our exploration of past uses of this Pillar we are asked to consider that once the Pillar was activated a doorway in space opened through which a serpentine figure, perhaps a soul, emerged. This soul would emerge from within and would select a female body to inhabit. This explains why the child was called her ‘son/lover’ and she was called a ‘virgin’. There was no physical intercourse with a man involved in the conception of this child. It was a medical/spiritual ceremony resulting in the insemination of the soul. Another name for this type of conception is parthenogenesis , the conception of a child by a female without fertilization by a male seed. 24 This word is derived from the Parthenos, the name of the temple of Pallas- Athena still standing on the Acropolis above Athens, and duplicated in Nashville, Tennessee in 1897. This temple was seized by the Christians in the fifth century or sixth century AD and rededicated as a temple to the virgin Mary. 25 Is there any evidence the Vestal priestesses used the Palladium to translate souls between dimensions as I have speculated? There may be. This possibility is brought to life in the great Roman poet Virgil’s poem The Aenid . In the Aenid , the hero Aeneas goes in search of himself. The Doves direct him to a branch of mistletoe, the Druid magic"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 40 wand made of hollywood or holy wood. He discovers that his true destiny lies in discovering the inspiration for creating the Roman Empire. Virgil describes the arrival of the Great Physician, the therapeutae : \u0001 Once, as the sacred infant she surveyed, The God was kindled in the raving maid; And thus she uttered her prophetic tale, Hail, Great Physician of the world! All hail. Hail, mighty infant, who, in years to come, Shalt heal the nations, and defraud the tomb! Swift be thy growth, thy triumphs unconfined, Make kingdoms thicker, and increase mankind. Thy daring art shall animate the dead, And draw the thunder on thy guilty head; And then shalt thou die, but from the dark abode Shalt rise victorious, and be twice a God. It is easy to think that the above lines about the healing god or Great Physician were derived from the Essene Therapeutae , or Physicians of the Soul. If so, this is our link to Jesus and John the Baptist, who were Therapeutae. To fully make the Thoth-Enoch-Pillar of Osiris connection to Jesus (and the Crucifixion) it is vital to remember that according to Revelation, Jesus has a word of power written on his ‘ thigh ’. 26 When he first appeared in the Book of Revelation he is holding seven stars or rays in his hand (like the Egyptian heron). 27 There is a profound connection between the Seven Rays, the Name on the thigh of Jesus and the Palladium Pillar. The Egyptian artist who painted the illustration reproduced here provides the link. It is drawn from the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 41 rectangular zodiac carving which once graced the ceiling of the great temple Hathor at Denderah, Egypt. It shows the first rays of the risen sun, Re or Horus (the Sun god) defeating the polar stars of Draconis and of the U r s a Major , the Plough. 28 The sunbeam or spear is pointed directly at the group of stars which we today call the Ursa Major or the Plough, but which the Egyptians called the “ Thigh ” or alternately the “Haunch of the Bull.” 29 The seven stars of Ursa Major from the Temple of Denderah. What does this have to do with the thighbone of the Templars and the return of Jesus (and also with the wounding of the thigh of the Fisher King in Grail legend)? Osiris was called the ‘Bull of Heaven’. 30 This suggests that the real meaning of the mark on the “thigh” of Jesus, and the ‘word of power’, has something to do with Osiris and the Seven Stars of Ursa Major. Further, the Bull or Thigh of Osiris is another name for the Pillar of Osiris and the Palladium. Further still, the Arab name for Ursa Major was ‘Nash’, meaning the ‘great coffin’.

Rather, it suggests the recovery of the Palladium Pillar of Osiris, or the skill o r knowledge associated with this technology. In many of the myths of the appearance of the messiah we find the Golden Pillar featured as the storage device for the soul and wisdom of the savior. This Pillar appears in the story of Enoch. In Scottish Freemasonry, which began at the dawn of the fourteenth century, Enoch, like Thoth, is credited with giving humanity the secrets of books and writing. He gave the secrets of building only to the Freemasons. According to legend, Enoch was warned of the coming deluge. With the help of his son Methuselah, he constructed nine vaults one on top another in a hidden location. Concealed within the lowest vault Enoch placed a gold triangular tablet (a ‘white oriental porphyry stone’ in one version) bearing the Ineffable Name of God -- the Word which grants one control over all the elements. It is claimed that Jesus performed his miracles by use of this sacred Ineffable Name, which is also the lost Key of Life to the Egyptians. On a second tablet of white Stone Enoch inscribed the secret knowledge of the angels. This tablet he gave to his son. The vaults were then sealed, and upon the spot Enoch supervised the construction of two magnificent, indestructible columns. One was made of fire proof marble. The other of Laterus, or brick, so that it would not sink in water. In other words, it was a floating stone. On the marble column Enoch placed a message that stated that nearby was buried an immense treasure in an underground vault. His work complete, Enoch then went to"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 43 Mount Moriah in Jerusalem and was ‘translated to heaven’. As noted, the words Moriah and Meru , atop whose peak is found Ida, describe similar places, a synchronicity that is of great significance to this inquiry. Incredibly, i n Greek, Meros means thigh . In Greek myth the savior Bacchus was nourished in a thigh . The Greek historian Herodotus says that Jupiter (‘the shining god of light’, who is also Di Pater, Dis Peter or Ptah) carried Bacchus in his thigh to Nysa (Meru). All of this suggests to me that the place where Enoch buried his treasure and the place where he was translated to Heaven are one and the same: Meru. Further, a device, the Palladium Pillar, may have been used to as a ‘canoe’ to perform this translation or transportation into the crysta l halls of Christ’s Court. Further corroboration of this idea comes from the Egyptians who called the Pillar of Osiris the Pillar of Mero or Meru . St. Jerome took up the story of this pillar in the fourth century writing that there are Nine Great Names of God in the Hebrew scriptures. 31 The Ninth is called the Holy Tetragrammaton, from the Greek tetra (four) and gramma (letter), the Word used by early Jewish authors writing in the Greek language to signify the most sacred and powerful name of God. Composed of four Hebrew letters, IHVH, this Word, it is claimed, is nothing less than the archetypal blueprint of creation. 32 Understanding of this Word revealed the secrets of the interchangeability of space and time, matter and energy, humans and angels. It was suppressed as early as four centuries before the time of Jesus. 33 Instead of speaking the name a Jew reading aloud the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 44 Scriptures who encountered the letters IHVH was instructed to speak the name “Adonai,” which means Lord or Light. However, it is inscribed upon the Pillar of Beauty, the central pillar that holds up the universe. In the mysterious Jewish alchemical text, The Bahir, 34 Teli is the name of this connecting link. It is often described as a pilla r or pole between Earth and Heaven. As a Jewish mystic, Jesus likely would have studied the Bahir , and therefore, would have known the secret of the Teli . St. Jerome said that inscribed vertically upon the Pillar of Beauty is an outline of the Divine Man, Jesus. For esotericists, the goal of all the mysteries is to completely unite with the heavenly Christ, who resides at his Crystal Court. In order to do so one must make themselves over into his magical pillar. As I fully explored in God Making , the superimposition of the human chakra or sacred energy system on the Pillar of Osiris reveals that this illustration is a cipher for the human mystic anatomy. The Pillar of Beauty that connects Earth and Heaven is within us. In the Orient, the two serpents of skill – one called Ida and the other Pingala -- are found within the human body. They wind around seven levels of psychophysical transformation known as “chakras,” which are knots or zones of energy located along the spine that must be “untied” to achieve enlightenment.

THE SEA OF GLASS In the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas Jesus gave a vital clue for how to access the inner technology required to open a gateway to Christ’s Court. “Lift the stone,” he said, “split the wood, there I am.” 1 In my view, ‘lifting the stone’ refers to raising our personal vibration, our tone or (s) tone . As all Grail questers learn, the Grail is the Alchemist’s Stone also known as the black or ‘hidden’ Stone of God . Once ‘lifted’ (understood or stolen), the quester discovers this Stone is inscribed with a mystery teaching which reveals the solutions to the riddles or secrets of creation and enables one to control the elements. This teaching enables the quester to ‘split the wood’. For some, the Stone of God is located within the Earth. My interpretation, however, suggests that it is located elsewhere. This locale is revealed in the story of Elijah’s ascension into Heaven. According to II Kings, Elijah knew in advance that he was going to ascend into Heaven. He stood on the banks of the river Jordan along with his son Elisha and ‘ took his mantle and wrapped it together ( ) and smote the waters, and they were divided .’ 2"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 49 In addition to being a c l o a k , the traditional interpretation of this symbol, in geology, the mantle is the soil covering the bedrock of the Earth. 3 Most provocatively, in anatomy the mantle is the cortex, 4 the thin layer of the cerebrum, the main part of the brain which is divided into two hemispheres. When Elijah ‘wrapped’ the two hemispheres together he transmuted his physical brain into a Crystal Skull. The advantage of this is that he could see the ‘hole (or whole) in Heaven’ and then could ascend or descend into Heaven. A mantle is anything that cloaks, covers or conceals. 5 When Elijah lifts the mantle -- or lifts the Stone -- he is playing the role of the Revealer. It is only when the secrets of the Crystal Skull are revealed, and one has completely spiritualized their thinking, that one gains true mastery. In the Vedic tradition, those who possess complete mastery over themselves are called Siddhas or perfected ones . The Cathars who called their priests perfects shared this title. Shortly after crossing the river Jordan there appeared before Elijah a chariot of fire, and horses of fire. And Elijah went up by a w h i r l w i n d into a ‘hole’ in heaven. 6 Awestruck, Elisha took up the mantle (‘lifted the Stone’) of Elijah. 7 Upon his return his companions thought he possessed the Spirit of Elijah. 8 When Jesus says ‘split the wood’, he may not be referring to splitting what we commonly know and experience as wood. The physical manifestation of wood only reflects the spiritual energy, or light, of which it is comprised. This spiritual energy is called the fifth elemen t, wood , also called quintessence , the fifth essence. Because he was a master wood worker, Jesus was called a"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 50 ‘carpenter’. The original Hebrew word for carpenter was naggar . It meant “fashioner.” To esotericists the actual wood this naggar or carpenter splits or fashions is not the material of which furniture is made. It is the wisdom of the Word . The Gospel of John says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” 9 God is the Word and the Word is the ineffable, miraculous Life Force Energy, the wood, upon which the world is built. Jesus was called the second Adam (Adama- h) and “the Word made flesh.” The great Alexandrian philosopher Origen (185-252 AD) revealed his Egyptian worldview when he expressed that the world is a living being. “As our body while consisting of human members is yet held together by one soul,” he said, “so the universe is to be thought of as an immense living being which is held together by one soul, the power of the Word .” Interestingly, says Barbara Walker, blue blood was called quinta essentia by the Romans, the “essential fifth part” or quintessence. 10 It was the sign of the gods’ nobility or aristocracy. Sometimes it was a sacred wine or ambrosia. Sometimes this fluid, which is the origins of the belief that the gods had blue blood or blue essence, was the fluid of Heaven. Medieval alchemists said the quinta essentia was a blue elixer that could confer spiritual illumination. When we lift the phoenix stone or Christ Stone within the mantle of our brain, and create the Crystal Skull, the Lord is waiting. Where is the Lord waiting? As we learned a moment ago, the Lord awaits in the “seventh heaven” on his crystal cube."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 51 Jesus further states our world and worlds in higher realms are intimately connected “from within outwards.” This statement refers to a transformation of consciousness that opens the mind’s eye to the crystal halls leading to other worlds. As I discussed in God Making , the two ‘tablets’ at the top of the Palladium Pillar of Osiris , and the two tablets buried by Enoch, represent the two hemispheres of the brain. They are ‘buried’ beneath the mantle or cortex of the brain. One of the best ways to begin to understand the basics of the crystalline Healing Sun mind-set provides is to begin by gazing at the three dimensional cube seen here. In 1832, a Swiss naturalist named L.A. Necker drew this three- dimensional cube on a piece of paper and noticed that its perspective had an odd way of reversing itself. The Necker Cube"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 52 One moment the face that seemed to be in front would suddenly flip to the back and the back’s face would suddenly flip to the front. Although a shift in eye fixation or mental effort could make this happen, Necker discovered it happened spontaneously, chaotically , on its own, every few seconds. Technically, the Necker cube is twelve lines on a piece of paper. They are projected into and brought to life in our imagination. These twelve lines correspond with the twelve labors of Hercules, a name that means ‘savior’ in Sanskrit. 11 By understanding this cube is twelve lines on a piece of paper, we have taken one giant step toward understanding how we create our reality and how the matrix of Christ’s Court functions. Look at it this way. If this cube is twelve lines on a piece of paper it is a good possibility that this book is something completely different than it at first appears to b e too. In fact, it is a chaotic collection of paper, ink, and glu e that all comes together in our imagination and we call it a book. What would the science teacher tell us this book really is? At one level they might tell us it is a complex tool for storing ideas. At another level it is chapters, paragraphs, sentences, words, and letters that all come together and we call them a book. If we continued to look at this book from a different perspective, as through an ordinary microscope , for example, the surface disappears and the book transforms into a collection of wood fibers. Under a more powerful electron microscope, a veil is split and the spaces between the fibers become evident. A completely different world appears."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 53 Digging further into this molecular world, what once was a mere book composed of wood, now transforms into a space so enormous even the spiraling particles begin to shift and fade. An inner universe appears. The paper upon which the ink representing these letters is composed of atoms, molecules, traces of particles; a fluid soup composed of a bunch of floating stuff that we can’t see, but which comes together in our imagination as a pattern of living energy and we call it a book. Below the atomic structure the particles shift into probability patterns of living energy. These patterns of living energy, the Word , are the stuff of modern physics, one category of which are called quarks , which physicists claim is another atom and is, therefore, the essential building block of matter. This is where science and religion unite, for scientists have never seen a quark. They take it on faith that they exist. They create mental pictures of what they think (guess) the immaterial atom looks like. With a mixture of terror and merriment they imagine a blur of electrons surrounding a tiny dot nucleus that draws the electrons to it like a swarm of bees to honey. It is remarkable that when symbolizing the smallest unit of matter Western scientists used the same ideogram as that used by the ancients to symbolize the galaxy , and the Galactic Core • of our galaxy, which is called the black or hidden sun behind the Sun . (In Chinese symbolism means sun and person.)"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 54 No two physicists or chemists view the atom exactly the same way because the building blocks of these images are symbols called equations that exist only in their minds. In this way the book you are reading, actually a collection of atoms or quarks does not really exist anywhere but in your imagination. Likewise for the chair you are sitting on. Put on your holy glasses. Take a good look around. Everything you perceive is a collection of atoms and molecules brought to life in your imagination. EVERYTHING ‘out there’ is made of the same things as this book. As the Buddhists teach, “all the world’s a dream.” In reality, there is no book. It is just one part of the One Thing ; the transcendent spiritual essence of which we are all made. This mental process is called a paradigm shift. The word paradigm comes from the Greek p a r a d i g m a (“pattern”). Essentially what this means is that people go about their lives perceiving only that which fits in with their idea of what the pattern should look like, they develop a mind set. Whether we care to acknowledge their existence or not these mindsets are very powerful. They operate on us subliminally determining how we experience the world from the most primitive levels of our mind/brain system. Our world mirrors our mind-set. However, there occasionally comes a time when the phenomena perceived by our advanced brains that do not fit can no longer be ignored. This usually results in a paradigm shift.

The doors of the crystal halls open to all that master the stories of the aforementioned prophets named John and Enoch, whose names it appears are interchangeable. Perhaps of all, the best place to begin this quest for understanding is with the glorious story of Enoch. A favorite part of the colorful patchwork of numerous ancient texts compiled by the Essenes at Qumran on the Dead Sea in c. 200 BC, the Book of Enoch is one of the most remarkable of the apocryphal or ‘hidden’ biblical ‘Healing Sun’ texts. The prophet Enoch was a descendent of Adam and the great-grandfather of Noah. In fact, he was the first mortal to re-enter the Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve’s expulsion. He was translated to Heaven where he joined the company of angels and took the name Metatron. 12 2 Enoch tells how the scribe was roused from his sleep one night by two tall, shining creatures whose ‘faces shone like the sun, and their eyes were like burning lamps; and fire came from their lips. Their dress had the appearance of feathers: their feet were purple, their wings were brighter than gold; their hands whiter than snow.’ 13 Later, we learn these beings had fair skin and thick blond hair like wool. 14 Enoch was a black-haired, olive-skinned Jew who lived in the harsh, sunny climate of Palestine. His eyewitness account of the Caucasian features of these ‘angels’ should therefore likely be taken literally. Consistent with Enoch’s account, John the Revelator encounters a Lord whose ‘eyes were as a flame of fire’ and whose hair was also white like wool. 15 The consistency of"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 56 these physical descriptions, along with the matching ‘crystalline’ description of the other (or inner) worldly domain of Christ suggests that they each are relating factua l eyewitness accounts, or that John simply borrowed his description from Enoch. Another possibility is that John is a member of the priesthood to which Enoch belonged. This is entirely possible. Many of the key concepts taught by or about Jesus himself can be traced to the Book of Enoch . As many as one hundred phrases in the New Testament were derived from Enoch . Scholars are now beginning to realize it was a favorite of the Essenes who were great compilers of ancient texts. Thus, it is reasonabl e to conclude that this was one of the Essene texts studied by John and Jesus. The presumed connection between Enoch and Thoth makes it further reasonable to conclude that these texts were Egyptian in provenance. Interestingly, John’s accoun t in the Book of Revelation of being taken to the crystal throne of Christ is glaringly similar to Verse 805 of the Pyramid Texts which tells us that the subject, the king Pepi, “has mastery of the Powers which are in thee... Thou art raised up. Sit upon thy crystal throne , by the decree of An- pu, Chief of the Divine Hall.” After being purified by eight libations Pepi has the appearance of the Morning Star. 17 Jesus was called the ‘bright and Morning Star’. In the Book of Revelation, John’s encounter with Christ begins when a door in Heaven opens and he immediately sees a throne with a rainbow and twenty-four elders around it. Out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices. 18 This description rings of the strange vibrating"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 57 flame with ‘tongues of fire’ that terrorized Enoch upon reaching the ‘seventh heaven’. 19 Enoch entered the vibrating flame and continued wandering the crystal halls of this otherworldly royal cour t. He next entered a ‘spacious habitation’ made entirely of crystal. 20 ‘Its portal blazed with fire’. 21 It was hot as fire and cold as ice. Again, terror overwhelmed him. He beheld another habitation in the midst of a vibrating flame . 22 It contained an exalted throne that looked like frost . 23 The Lord was there waiting, sitting upon his icy throne. In the Lord’s company are hosts of angels called Cherubim and Seraphim. Included in the Seraphim are the archangels Gabri-el and Micha-el, who are also described as Watchers or Shining Ones in the Book of Enoch . These angelic Sons and Daughters of God were sent from Heaven long ago to teach human beings. According to the Book of Genesis, trouble ensued when the Watchers mated with the daughters of man. 24 Though they apparently were alien beings the beauty of the earthly daughters of Cain seduced them. One of the hybrid children of the alien- earthling coupling was Noah, whose surprised father, Lamech, was terrified by his son who filled a darkened room with light. Lamech complained to Methuselah that Noah, whose “eyes are like the rays of the Sun and his face shines” was born not from his sperm but from the angels. 25 According the genealogy provided in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus was a descendent of Lamech and Noah. 26 The offspring of this trans-species coupling were called Nephilim – fallen ones — powerful giants who wrecked havoc in the pre-Flood world. These trouble-making angels taught the secret arts and sciences of Heaven forbidden by"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 58 God, including metalsmithing, architecture, geography, astronomy, cosmetics and healing. 27 An advanced technological society was born. Just as Prometheus was severely punished by Zeus for daring to give the gift of fire to mankind, so did God punish the Watchers and their children. As punishment, God sent the Flood to destroy humanity. He spared Enoch’s great- grandson Noah and his family. The ancient angels who had apparently misled humanity with their technology were cast into an abyss of fire along with their leader. The Shining Ones were perceived by those on Earth thousands of years later when the Old Testament prophet, Daniel ( c. 600 BC), sees the Ancient of Days, whose “garment was white as snow, and the hair on his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.” 28 We will further investigate the fantastic story of these Watchers momentarily. First, it is imperative to study one of the extraordinary details of their home, Christ’s Court. Daniel records that he saw “the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea.” 29 John says that before the crystal throne of Christ there was a ‘ Sea of Glass like unto a crystal ’. Four beasts marked this throne: a lion, a bull, a man and an eagle. Daniel and John apparently saw the same place. Now this is intriguing. These same four beasts symbolize the four elements of air (man), fire (lion), earth (ox) and water (eagle), the last card of the major arcana of the Tarot, the World, and also the four Gospel evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The guardian of the Hall of Records, the Sphinx of Giza, which the Arabs called the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 59 ‘Father of Terror’, was originally a composite beast of the lion, bull, man and eagle. 3 0 These four beasts also symbolize the Tetragrammaton, the Word of God. 31 These symbols point to four astrological ages as significant in humankind’s development: Leo (the Lion), Taurus (the Bull), Aquarius (the Man) and Scorpio (the Eagle). These four Ages mark times when humanity would make quantum leaps forward into Golden Ages of learning. Proponents of the Hall of Records idea believe that a new Golden Age will arise upon revelation of the secret knowledge preserved in the Hall. Corresponding to John’s experience of seeing the four- cornered Sea of Glass, in the Book of Enoch the birdmen raise Enoch to the top of a mountain “which reached to heaven.” 32 There, he beheld the receptacles of light, 33 “the great darkness or mountains of gloom which constitute winter, the mouths of rivers and of the deep, the stone which supports the corners of the Earth , and the four winds which bear up the Earth , and constitute the pillars of heaven .” 34 These ‘four winds that bear up the Earth’ are often associated with the four beasts Daniel and John saw guarding the Sea of Glass. Ancient religionists thought of the Earth as flat and rectangular in shape, placed on several pillars (perhaps 12 ) which, in turn, are based on a foundation. They thought of the sky as a circular dome over the square of the Earth. Hence, a “squared circle” is the ultimate symbol of reconciliation of the heavens with the Earth. This pattern explains why Christian and Moslem churches, whose goal was reconciliation with God (or C a t h a r s i s ), were constructed as a dome upon a square foundation. These"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 60 earthly temples are copies of a structure, the Sea of Glass, described as existing in Heaven.

History shows, however, that one of the mysteries guarded by the intellectual elite was that of mapmaking. Included in this knowledge was the fact that the Earth is round, not flat. The famed Piri Reis map depicts geographic knowledge that attests to this knowledge. Made by a Turkish mapmaker from a collection of twenty ancient maps, this phenomenal map is amazingly accurate in its portrayal of Earth’s geography.

Since Antarctica has been covered with a sheet of ice – averaging 2 miles deep – the original maps used by the Turk have been conservatively dated to 4,000 BC, the time before the last ice age. Furthermore, Antarctica was not officially discovered until 1818. 35 The elite further knew that the Earth spins clockwise once daily around a polar axis which points always to the same spot on the “vault” of Heaven, while the Earth revolves once a year around the sun. When Galileo announced his telescopic verification of the sun-centered hypothesis the Church threatened him with death in order to protect its secret. Revelation of the forbidden sun-centered hypothesis brings enormous knowledge including the ability to plot the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, thereby telling the time of day, and day of the year. It also reveals the secrets of navigation. Ultimately, it reveals a sacred geometry whose symbols and forms reveal our true relation to God. Control of these sciences of agriculture, navigatio n and sacred geometry -- all originally taught by the Shining Ones from the Healing Sun -- assured the Church’s control over the illiterate masses. The Biblical model is, in fact, one that has an Earth, basically spherical in shape, with angular continents, and pillars (or ‘stones’) which undergird the world. The most famous of the Bible verses supporting a round or spherical Earth is Isaiah 40:22 where it says of God that:"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 63 “It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the Earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in...” The pillars can be shown to correspond to crystalline rock that composes the shell of the Earth, commonly called the mantle. Mother Nature has seen to it that the clear (rock) Quartz crystal is the most common mineral on the surface or shell of the Earth. The Earth also has a crystalline iron core. It resonates to stellar vibrations. The mineral content of Earth’s surface, including crystal, circulates as a constructive element throughout the vegeta l and animal realms. In this way crystal ‘projects’ itself int o creation. Our brains and our DNA, are additional examples of this ‘projection. We are tuned by these pulsing vibrations from our galaxy and beyond. Occasionally vertical crystalline forms form above the surface of the Earth. Further, there are an unspecified number of foundations to the Earth, which can range from the roots of mountains to the core of the Earth to the very foundation, which Christians believe is Jesus Christ, himself. The Book of Job 36 states that God laid the foundations of the Earth, and the sixth verse indicates that the foundations are themselves fastened upon a spiritual force . In his epistle to the Hebrews Paul names this spiritual force as Jesus Christ who “ upholds all things by the word of his power .” 37 In the above references to the foundations of the Earth there are two things that become crystal clear. First, the foundations (or pillars) of the Earth are bound together by a"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 64 spiritual force, a ‘stone’ or pillar, called Christ. Second ly, they are located somewhere ‘beneath’, in the inner Earth. 38 What, exactly, is meant by these two statements is a mystery. Is Christ really standing in the inner Earth holdin g up our world ala Superman or Atlas? The Bible illuminates this mystery. In the prayer of Hannah which can be found in I Samuel 2 starting at verse 8: “He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory : for the pillars of the Earth are the Lord’s, and he hath set the world upon them .” This verse indicates one of the soul’s earthly objectives: to inherit the throne of glory, which is Christ’s icy throne. This verse also obviously indicates that the Earth has pilla rs and that the ‘world’ (that would be the Sea of Glass) is a separate entity set upon them, not having any pillars of its own. Note that this verse does not necessarily say that the Earth is placed on the pillars, only that the world is placed thereon. Also note that in the Bible’s version of this story these pillars belong to the Lord. Job provides a most astonishing detail about the pillars of the Earth. It reads: “He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing .” 39 In addition to the pillars and foundations underneath, the Earth also hangs upon nothing. How can this be? The answer, like the story of Enoch and Jesus, must be one part spiritual and one part scientific/literal. As occurred wit h the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 65 sun-centered hypothesis, the knowledge of the force upon which the Earth hangs has been ‘occulted’, kept hidden, secret. To answer this question of how the Earth can hang upon ‘nothing’, we must turn to the occultists or esotericists, the keepers of the secrets of the ages. To repeat, esotericists believe fire and ice represent the two universal polarities. Fire is frequency, vibration, or pressure. Ice is frozen or pressurized water. When the pressure of fire meets water crystal is formed. The word “crystal” is derived from the Greek word “krystallos”, meaning ice. If the pillars of the world are under pressure, creating a state of vibrational stability, this may be the answer for how the Earth is held aloft by ‘nothing’. It also explains why Christ’s court is made of ‘crystal’. That the pillars support the surface of the Earth (where the world is) is clear from H-Annah’s song. This ‘song’ may be interpreted as a protective tone or frequency. We have already noted the Earth to be spheroidal in shape and so the Earth’s pillars must be located between the Earth’s surface and the core. In particular, the pillars of the Earth could simply be vertically oriented crystalline rock in the inner core of the Earth. In order to clear up this mystifying circumstance it is essential to recognize that the New Testament idea of a four-cornered world supported by spiritual pillars is not a n original Christian concept. Sumerian and Egyptian myth explored and developed a similar idea several thousand years earlier."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 66 4. THE GUARDIAN SPIRITS The Sumerians were among the earliest, most prolific, and accurate mythmakers. They too believed our world had four corners, and they told of a protective prayer to the four guardian spirits who protect it: “Shamash before me, behind me Sin, Nergal at my right, Ninib at my left.” The Jewish people who changed the names of the protective angels copied this same prayer. Now it says: “On my right Michael, at my left Gabriel, before me Uriel, behind me Raphael.” These are the same four Watcher angels of the Book of Enoch and the archangels of the Book of Revelation who stand on the four corners of the Sea of Glass. These four ‘angles’ are also known as the four Guardian Stars of Heaven. This arrangement of four protective deities is found in Egypt where four female divinities (Isis, Selket, Nepthys and Neith) encircle the outer Canopic Chest of gilded wood in Tut-ank-Amun’s tomb, a cube of gold.

A vast, remote, secret facility, Abydos was known as the site of the origins of the religion of Osiris, the green - faced god of gardening. Now largely covered by the modern village of Beni Mansur, Abydos is located just one hundred or so miles, as the heron flies, down the Nile from the Giza complex and the Hall of Records. It has its own set of tantalizing tales describing subterranean halls and chambers.

In a later chapter I will connect the ‘Galilean magician/physician’, Jesus, with these very sam e texts. Religious and medical books, including the Egyptian Book of the Dead were written in the Houses of Life and housed in their temple libraries. 2 Some of the chapters of the Book of the Dead deal exclusively with the ‘great mysteries’. One chapter, named ‘The Book of the Lady of the Hidden House’ is described as containing ‘very great secrets’. At their core, these books describe the means whereby the soul learned to aquaint itself with the nonphysical energies and forces under the guardianship of the neters or gods, who once lived at Abydos. Through these spiritual forces (called Christ by the Christians) the soul could free itself of earthly influence s, including illness, and achieve Catharsis . This is the secret of the Phoenix or Christ Stone. The esoteric training of the House of Life gave knowledge of the inner realms. It was by journeying into the Underworld (the Tuat) that the student experienced the world of the gods. The House of Life described by Salt Papyrus 825 adds a vertical axis (a Teli or Pillar) that suggests envisioning the world spatially. “A figure standi ng in a cube. His two arms are extended following the east- west axis and his feet are in stride in the perpendicular direction north-south.” The Great Hidden God rests in the interior. 3 The papyrus describes four doors opening on to the four cardinal points, exactly like the ‘Cube of Gold’ in Tut- ankh-Amun’s tomb.

The remarkable consistency of this bird-brained four- cornered world idea in the religions of the ancients, I feel, offers testimony that the religions of the world emanated from a common center. The commonality of this symbol also suggests some form of coded knowledge concerning the Sea of Glass being copied or intentionally passed along through the ages. The followers of John the Baptist were among the priests who copied this knowledge. According to the third-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 71 century Clementine Recognitions , it was at Alexandria in Egypt that John’s international religious organization wa s based. This ancient university town was known as a hotbed of Judaism and Buddhism where hundreds of thousands of ancient texts from all over the ancient world were housed. 4 In the seventeenth century, Jesuit missionaries returning from what is now Iraq brought back tales of a group of people who called themselves ‘St. John’s Christians’. John’s followers had several names including Nasurai and Sabian. However, their most powerful name, as far as I am concerned, was Mandaean. “Mandaeans” is derived from “manda” or “menda” which means in the Mandaic language “knowledge”. The Mandaic word for priest, nasurai , is derived from the Mandaic root NTR (the Egyptian word Neter) that means: “To watch over, guard, preserve, take care of, keep back, retain.” 5 \u0001 The Nasoraeans in Mandaean religion denotes the keepers of the sacred knowledge, even at the expense of the laymen. Nasoraeans of the Mandaean type ‘keep and observe’ ritual laws with zealous fidelity and ‘keep back’ -- even from their own laity -- mysteries considered deep and easily misunderstood by the uninitiated. 6 In the Koran the Mandaeans are called Sabians . “Sabian” is a word derived from the Aramaic-Mandic verb “ Saba ” which means “baptized” or “dyed”, “immersed in water”. Thus, “Mandaean Sabians” means those who are baptized in the knowledge of God and who know the religion of God."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 72 Remember that Nazorean is derived from the root NTR, “one who watches.” The following Egyptian entries suggest a link between the root SB or Saba and those who protect and deliver knowledge (including Jesus, the Nazarene): Sbat -- teaching, training, instruction, pupil. 7 Sbai -- teacher, wise man, instructor. 8 In Egypt, Sa is the word for the holy blood of Isis, 9 which made pharaohs and other heroes immortal (ala the quintessence which created the noble blue blood). This, I have proposed, is the purpose of the Christ Stone. Ancient Egyptian myths say the Sba or Saba came from the stars. S b a means ‘star, god’ 10 and ‘great door of Heaven’ 11 (which brings to mind Jesus’ statement “I am the door.” 12 ) In particular, they are associated with the Morning Star and star of love, 13 Venus -- AMOR in French. They were the original bearers of the Key of Life – or knowledge of life. Later, after a ‘changing of the gods’, a changing upheld to this day by the Catholic Church -- the meanings of the word Saba completely shifted. The following entries reveal the change: Sba – the enemy apep. 14 Sab – judge. 15 Seba – serpent-god of evil. 16 Catholics were taught to fear the wise beings. When John the Baptist (or Saba) baptized Jesus in the river Jordan, he undoubtedly would have initiated him in the knowledge of Light and the Key of Life of the Egyptian net-er or the Saba.

Eliminated from the current portrayal is his connection to the Egyptian Neter. Another area in which the historical Jesus differs from the Jesus of current faith is in the baptism, the bedrock of Christianity. Prior to the Last Supper Jesus taught daily at the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. Solomon was the wise king who had a notorious love affair with the Queen of Saba (or Sheba). One day the chief priests and elders asked him by what authority he taught. Jesus responded with a question: the baptism of John, was it from Heaven or of men? 17 He responded by telling them the parable of the vineyard. In the Gospels Jesus dodged the question of the baptism (or the Bible editors deleted his actual response). This is a crucial question. Today, Jesus is a savior worshipped as God. Millions upon millions of Christians are familiar with the traditional (exoteric) baptism by immersion in water. But was this the original baptism of John and Christ? After telling the elders the parable of the vineyard, Jesus asks them if they read the scriptures wherein it is told that the “ stone which the builders rejected...is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.” 18 He then warns that the kingdom of God shall be taken from the priests and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of God. ‘The stone that the builders rejected’ is central to the Grail mystery. As I described earlier and have treated extensively in other works, this ‘stone’ is the fire, frequency, keys, tones or vibrations that emanate from the Healing Sun at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. When they reach the Earth they turn to stone and are found in the mantle or top layer of the soil in various parts of the Earth."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 74 They turn from tones to (s)tones. These are the Phoenix (S)tones or Christ (S)tones that emanate from the celestial choir at the galaxy’s core, Tula. The fire or wisdom that emanates from the Healing Sun is also called the water or wisdom of life. When the pressure of fire meets water crystal is formed. Occultists believe fire and ice (ice is frozen water) represent the two polarities within. When these forces – male and female, light and dark, fire and water – are balanced within they are “christified” or “crystalized”. Hence, the baptism is a crucial key to understanding the crystal halls of Christ’s Court. According to esoteric Christian art and legend, when John baptized Jesus in the sacred river Jordan (where Elijah previously opened a hole in Heaven) it was full of flames or light. Nineteenth century scholar and linguist Godfrey Higgins (1771-1833), observes that the word Jordan is derived from Eridan or Eridanus , an ancient name for the Milky Way. The word Eridanus has been traced to the Sumerian Eridu , the place whose “pure light reaches heaven.” 19 Eri , says Higgins, means savior . 20 Eridu was the first settlement of the Sumerian god E.A., a healer whose symbol was the serpent-entwined caduceus , eons before it was connected with Thoth and Jesus.

Akhenaton’s heretical religion of Aton was one of the forerunners of the Essene religion. After his baptism Jesus was called Adon (which is the same as Aton) or Lord.

In Hawaii we have an excellent example of this part of the code at work. In one legend Kane is “ the god of Light ” who bathed in a pool of “living water.” 29 The Mandaeans’ Supreme Being, who created the universe, appears under various names that translate as ‘Life’, ‘Mind’ or ‘King of Light’. 30 To be ‘enlightened’ meant literal and figuratively entering the world of light and love (AMOR). This ‘water of life’ was called mana by the Hawaiians. They called it “fine rain.” The Egyptians called it mist . This is the origin of our word myst- ery . In the Old Testament we have the exact same word mana , as manna , the food of the gods. Manna fed the ‘spirit or light body’. This was the substance promised by the Holy Spirit in the Book of Revelation. The interlocking nature of the Egyptian, Indian, Christian, kahuna and Hebrew traditions is plainly evident, and is explained by the kahuna belief that as the Keepers of the Secret they are the original Egyptians and Hebrews."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 81 5. THE CUBE OF SPACE From the foregoing, we may conjecture that the esoteric baptism performed by John bathed Jesus in the light and knowledge of the Central Healing Sun. This prepared the initiate to enter the world of light or love, Elijah’s hole in Heaven, and to walk the crystal halls of Christ’s Court. Fascinatingly, when flipped vertically the symbol for the neter becomes the or vesica piscis, also known as the ‘vessel of Isis’. It was used by the early Christians to represent the Mystic Union and Jesus. 1 These ‘eyes’ appear in a key revelation unlocking the esoteric mysteries encoded in the Sumerian and Egyptian descriptions of the four-cornered world and the Sea of Glass. It is found in John’s description of the crystal Court of Christ. In John’s account he notes that the lion, bull, man and eagle, or more likely the Sea of Glass that the four angels guard, is “ full of eyes before and behind .” 2 The Sea of Glass is “full of eyes.” This is an amazing observation for the fact that ‘eyes’ were sometimes used by the ancient Egyptians to represent not only the neter , but also planets. If these ‘eyes’ are planets, the four- cornered world label refers not to the terrestrial world, bu t rather to a sector or Cube of Space !"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 82 This grid or matrix in space is a ‘container of creation’ demarcated by the four cardinal constellations in the signs of the Zodiac -- Taurus (bull), Leo (lion,) Aquila (eagle) and Aquarius (man).

They are Regulus, lying in the constellation Leo (the lion ), Aldebaran, lying in the constellation Taurus (the bull ), Fomalhaut, lying in the constellation Aquarius (the water-bearing m a n ), and Antares, lying in the constellation Scorpio (the eagle ). 3 Could the Sea of Glass John (and Daniel) observed Christ ruling over actually be a sector of space that is full of (inhabited) planets and stars? The Sumerians certainly seemed to think so. According to the Sumerian creation stories that describe the four cornered world, a celestial conflict occurred between a massive planet called Nibiru or An , and another planet called Tiamat , a planet which once existed between Mars and Jupiter. An or Anu was the Sumerian name for the Divine or the Lord. Its cuneiform sign , a three-nail cross that evolved into the + , which meant “the sign,” was cut and pasted by Christian mythographers into Christian mythology. 4 In this conflict An’s primary weapon against Tiamat was a four-cornered Net: The four winds he (An) stationed that nothing of her could escape :"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 83 The South Wind, the North Wind. the East Wind, the West Wind. Close to his side he held the Net , the gift of his grandfather Anu who brought forth the Evil Wind, the Whirlwind and the Hurricane... In the Hebrew tradition, whose creation myths are derived from the Sumerian originals, Tiamat is called Ta- Marah and Mer , the ‘mother waters’ and ‘source of life’. 5 The Book of Genesis begins during a time when ‘the Earth was formless and void’. 6 This was before God created light. The meaning of the Akkadian word Tiamat and the Hebrew tah-om are the same, ‘the Deep’. In Genesis, it is upon the waters of the Deep (Tiamat) that, in the beginning, God’s soul moves. With this in mind the description of An capturing Tiamat in a ‘Net’ becomes most tantalizing. If we read this account as though it were an ancient New York Times story, we might envision An, as a planet or entity, homesteading in space. The four winds sound remarkably like an advanced technology capable of creating a permanent force field in space out of which “nothing could escape.” We could imagine An, ‘the Lord’ , marking off a ‘garden’ by placing a three-dimensional protective crystalline cub e or Sea of Glass over a sector of space. The importance of Tiamat to our story cannot be overemphasized.

From the ancient myths of the destruction of Tiamat we learn of a soul line that was the victim of a planetary holocaust. The Egyptians called this civilization Maat, th e Mother of all things. The Egyptian name for the Earth -- Ta Meri – is the same as the Hebrew name for Tiamat, Ta- mera. This is explained in the Sumerian model. An (also called Marduk) chases Tiamat. Notice the diamond-shaped net. As a result of her dysfunctional relationship with An, “the watery dragon,” or “the female monster” the goddess Tiamat was shattered. 4 One half of her body became the asteroid belt circling Mars and Jupiter. The other half became Earth.

However, careful consideration should be given to the fact that very often conflict is injected into ancient myths where none actually existed. This makes the stories entertaining, and therefore, memorable and worth re-telling. In this light, instead of a weapons system, the four winds that created the sealed garden, created by the Lord, could actually have been a benevolent force that created a stable habitat or biosystem for souls. Another way to think of this sealed cube of glass would be to imagine taking an aquarium with fish inside and placing it in the ocean. The glass walls would become ‘invisible’ in the water, but would protect the fish from intruders. It would be a ‘black’ or ‘hidden’ Sea of Glass, and a House of Life, a secret refuge. If we think of our world as a four-cornered garden or aquarium, a House of Life or Sea of Glass, floating in a cosmic ocean of blackness, the four corners mark off a protective shield in space. In the illustration on the next page baboons, the sacred animals of Thoth, god of wisdom and knowledge, drag a net full of ‘fish’. The fish are a symbol of the ignorant and undeveloped soul. 7 If the Net is a symbol for the Underworld, then swimming into the Net is an experience the soul would apparently prefer to avoid.

A veil is placed over our divine consciousness and we become human. We shroud ourselves in ignorance. While on Earth we are trapped but not trapped in the Sea of Glass. An aquarium typically does not participate in the life of the fish contained within it. It only marks the boundaries. The Sea of Glass on the other hand is interactive. It is composed of intelligent matter. The cube , cell or grid melds itself to the mind of its maker: each soul who inhabits it. As Buddhist teaching describes, all of Earth life is an illusion or ‘maya’. In terms of the material world, everything is ‘real’. In terms of our spiritual being , nothing is real.

Metaphysically, we may think of the four-cornered chunk of space as a habitat for souls. It is open to as many souls as would like to visit it. The Egyptians taught that every human being has a ‘lower self’ (the ba) and an immortal Higher Self (the Ka). The lower self resides in the physical body. The Higher Self, resides in Heaven.

The word Ka when pronounced kay is the same as key . In fact, our Ka can be compared to the vibrating modes superimposed within a single tone or song, the uni- verse or mono-tone. Each human heart contains the Ka as the seat of the human soul. Shaped like a luminous egg, the Ka is the ‘tiny dancer’ within. We live and die waiting for our ba to ‘strike the Ka or key chord’ and turn on the heart’s light. When this occurs, the ba becomes nourished and enlightened.

The Net here described may be one of the most complex machines (or weapons) ever conceived. If my interpretation of the Net is correct, there is evidence that at least one ancient civilization had understanding of such a technology.

If our world is enclosed, it must be for a reason. As pointed out, in numerous ancient contexts our world is guarded by four angels or Watchtowers, also called ‘pillars’ that entrap human souls in order to protect them. In Persian tradition, i t is the mystic who arms himself with a net in an attempt to capture God. What I want to suggest is that if this interpretation of the four winded Net or Sea of Glass sounds far-fetched, we should recall that Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven “is like unto a Net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind. Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. So shall it be at the end of the world.” 11 By this parable he was surely not referring to a simple fisherman’s net. Jesus also prophesied the Kingdom of God would be established in three days. These ‘stages’ have been interpreted as thousand year periods or millennia. Stage one involved the initial preaching of the Gospel. The emphasis in stage two was the spiritualization of the Law. Many believe the year 2,000 marked the transition into stage three, which is called the Harvesting of Souls. This harvesting is undoubtedly carried out with the Net. Stage three would be initiated by an Apocalypse: a final battle between the temptations of the material world and enlightenment into the spiritual kingdom.

The story of the Net is, in fact, woven throughout the tapestry of the story of Jesus. When this tapestry is investigated it is clear that it was woven from threads that existed long before his time. Pulling on the first thread, we find the Virgin Mary’s link with the Net is reflected in the etymology of her name, ‘Maria’, which comes from the Latin mare , meaning ‘sea’. All the Great Mothers of mythology were born from the primeval ocean. They were called the ‘white’ or ‘pure’ goddess. In the Hebrew tradition, we know, Tiamat is called Marah (the sea, mother, or matter), which is the root for Mary. In Sumeria, the goddess Mari, “Mother Love,” or the Queen of Heaven, was continually worshipped for over three thousand years ( c. 3500 - 500 BC) in the ancient Near East. The people of Mari believed that the universe was the property of a large pantheon of gods and goddesses who were human in form, but superhuman in their powers. They believed the goddess Mari lived in her temple on Earth. Among Mari’s many titles she was known as Ma-Ya , ‘the Lady of Life’, or simply Ma . 13 Her temple/womb/sheepfold was considered the Vessel of Creation. Mari’s temple was discovered at Mari on the Euphrates River in Syria.

She holds her cup of life in her hand. She wears her Shugurra helmet, along with her Pala (miracle) coat and other accoutrements. The word pala is the root for palladium . Mari kept a pillar at her compound. According to Sumerian myth, Mari/Inanna rescued the Tree of Life from the world flood and planted it in her garden at Mari. This Tree was an axis connecting the underworld with Earth and the heavens. With her Shugurra helmet snuggly fitting her head, Mari goes to her sheepfold, which is the center of nature of Sumer (or Su- Meru ). Sitchin translates Shugurra as ‘that which makes go far into the universe’, 15 suggesting that it helps her travel into the inner world or far into the universe . It may be more than eloquent coincidence, or sheer poetry, that Shu-gurr-a resolves to Sgr A , the radio source believed to lie at the exact Core of our galaxy, which was discovered in 1932, two years before the discovery of Mari’s statue.

ABRAHAM Though his history was not written down until hundreds if not thousands of years after his crystalline bones had turned to dust, it is believed Abraham was born in Ur, the City of Light, in southern Babylonia sometime between 1800 and 1700 BC. The Bible, the primary source material concerning his life, records that there he married his extraordinarily beautiful wife Sara. 1 Abraham and his family abruptly left the City of Light by command of his God, Yahweh. 2 From a young age -- Hebrew legends say ever since he came out of a cave at the age of three -- he was on a search for the Truth. Yahweh sent him out of Ur on a search for a new dwelling place for his tribe. Upon leaving Ur Abraham and his family trekked into the land of Canaan. 3 Previous to this they lived at a place called Haran, provocatively called “the land of holes”. Sunday school teachers routinely paint Abraham as a nomadic shepherd with very little spiritual awareness (despite the fact that three great religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, sprung from his story). However, according to the Sefer Yetzirah , 4 the phenomenal mystic ‘hidden scrolls’ of the Jewish tradition, Abraham learned t o make souls at Haran."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 98 The introduction to the Sefer Yetzirah states, “ This is the Book of the Letters of Abraham our father, which is called the Sefer Yetzirah , and when one gazes into it there is no limit to his wisdom .” In its final stanza the Sefer Yetzirah says that when Abraham “ Looked and probed he was successful in creation .” 5 This passage clearly suggests that Abraham had learned to peer into and manipulate the mother substance of creation through some form of mystical sight. From the 21 st century perspective, the “ Book of the Letters ” is an obvious reference to the Book of Life of DNA and its four ‘letters’. This also hints that Abraham (and even Jesus, who inherited Abraham’s knowledge) was quite possibly a chemist, an alchemist or even a geneticist. Where did Abraham receive the seed crystal of such a profound skill? The answer to this question is forthcoming. It returns us to AMOR, the homeland of the Saba. After God commanded Abraham to leave Haran, the Bible says Abraham took Sara, his nephew Lot, and “all their substance that they had gathered , and all the souls that they had gotten at Haran ,” 6 and they went forth into the land of Canaan. He followed the Euphrates through the land of Sichem to the kingdom of Mari and its fabulous capital city. 7 Abraham’s ancestors probably lived part of their lives in Mesopotamia or Sumeria, present-day Iraq. Around the time of Abraham (1800 BC) areas in Sumeria were invaded by a Semitic tribe called Amorites , whose center was called Mari , near Haran, from where Abraham journeyed to Canaan. 8 The word Mari is similar to Moreh or Meru , from"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 99 whence Enoch was translated to Heaven.

Because he was the son of Mari and a soul who lived within the Pillar Amurru was symbolized by the pillar. The Pillar of Amurru (or Meru?). This is quite fascinating. According to the Andean Elders, the entire American landmass was known to the ancients as “Amaraka,” the “Land of the Immortals,” or “the Land of the Wise Serpents.” 10 “Amarka” is a title derived from the Incan word Amuru , ‘ serpent’.

Many of the names of Abraham’s family have Amorite origin, suggesting to some scholars that this (America?) was his land of origin too, although, as Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin observes, there is nothing in the Bible to suggest that Abraham and his family were Amorites. 11 However, it is held that Abraham’s Semetic family was part of a confederacy of tribes that included the Amorites. Because he came from the line of Shem, Abraham has long been considered a Semite , as opposed to the non-Semetic Sumerians and the later Indo-Europeans or Aryans . As Sitchin observes, in the original Biblical sense, all the people of greater Mesopotamia were descended of Shem, “Semites” and “Sumerians” included. Today the word Aryan is emotionally loaded with negative connotations. This is because it was completely misunderstood by the perverted Nazis thugs with horrifying results. Originally the Sanskrit word arya did not refer to either a race or a language but to a moral quality or mental disposition – that of ‘nobility’ or ‘purity’. 12 Interestingly, aria means a ‘melody in an opera’. The term Aryan was first used by Herodotus to describe the Persians (Iranians) and Medes. Iran is the ancient name of Persia, and it is derived from the root “Arya” or Aryan , the Indo-European branch of peoples who settled in that land. It gained widespread use in Germany in 1819 when Friedrich Schlegel connected the root Ari with the German word Ehre , or honor. 13 Ari and Ehre are the same word as Eri , the root of Eridu, the celestial river. I feel that careful"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 101 consideration should be given to the idea that the word Aryan was originally meant to denote a group of people who knew the secrets of life, including the song (aria) or key of life of Choir-ist or Christ, ‘the pure one’, rather than a particular race of people. Among his other activities Schlegel was an author, historian and diplomat. After learning Sanskrit, the language of India, he proclaimed that absolutely a l l knowledge is of Indian (Aryan) origin. 14 He even went so far as to say that India was the birthplace of humanity and religion and that even Egyptian civilization was founded by a group of Aryan missionaries. I feel that these ‘Aryan’ or ‘noble’ missionaries were the Saba or Neter. John the Baptist was among these missionaries. The Nazis would soon elevate this key idea, that a group of wandering Aryan priests founded great civilizations and religions, to the rank of scientific truth. Unfortunately, they disastrously misinterpreted the meaning of Aryan and covered-up or attempted to destroy competing ideologies. For instance, prior to World War Two, a German professor of the history of religion at Leipzig University suggested the idea that Abraham may have not been a lowborn Semetic as widely believed. After reviewing the diplomatic encounters of Abraham, including a meeting with the Egyptian Pharaoh and other high-echelon diplomats, Alfred Jeremias concluded that Abraham was Sumerian, and therefore, not a Semite. He was of pure descent. After his ascent to power Hitler quickly challenged and demonized the heretical idea that the Jewish patriarch Abraham was of pure, Ayran descent. 15"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 102 Let us by-pass Hitler’s prohibition and look deeply at the linguistic and Grail link between Abraham and the Amorites, the children of the Pure Goddess Mari, and Abraham’s children, the Keturah , and the Cathars , who called themselves the Pure Ones and their church Amor. In the Bible, the Amorites were said to have lived in the mountains, the highlands, and the coastal plains of Canaan. This area is identified as being near modern Nablus, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizum. This is some thirty miles north of Jerusalem, west of the Jordan River in the center of Palestine. The land was occupied by the Canaanites. The Amorite name means literally “the high one” and may refer to: • The mountainous terrain of the land they occupied; 15 (Highlander or Mountaineer). • Their fearsome military prowess. 16 • Their great stature. 17 The term “high one” is strikingly close in meaning to “noble one” or “high born.” It is close enough to enable us to question if the Aryan “high born” of India is the same as the Amorite “high ones”. An encyclopedia published by the Church of Latter Day Saints offers the following about the Amorites: “There is some uncertainty as to the use of this name ; it probably denotes a fair-skinned and blue-eyed race (as we learn from Egyptian monuments) who inhabited the south of Palestine before Semitic tribes like the Israelite s, Ammonites, Edomites, etc., made their appearance there. Lachish was one of their chief cities. In the Tell el-Amarna tablets Amurri is the common name for Palestine.” The word palestine is derived from pala , the root of palladium ."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 103 This perfectly aligns the Palestinians with the Aryan or “noble” people of the pillar. The Mormons direct us to Egypt for more about the fair-skinned and blue-eyed Amorite race, and we shall shortly follow their lead. And we must, Egypt’s original name was Ta-Mari (T-Amari), the ‘land of the waters’ or ‘land of love’. The Amorites are first mentioned as early as Genesis. 10:16 as having descended from Canaan, the first son of Ham, who accompanied his father, Noah, on the Ark. 18 “And the sons of Noah, that went forth on the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japeth...These are the three sons of Noah. The biblical tale of Noah’s Ark 19 in which Noah and his family rode-out the Flood is one of enormous mystery. In the story, God decides to destroy humanity for having relations and offspring with the Nephilim. Prior to sending the Flood he tells Noah to build an ark to ride out the cataclysm. After the waters recede God promises Noah that He would never again destroy the world by flood. As evidence of His ‘covenant’ or contract God set his rainbow in the sky. These essential elements of the Flood myth are found the world over. Because of its universal nature this story has been latched on to by many traditions. Grail researchers, for example, speculate Noah’s Ark is actually the same as the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant.

In the Hebrew and Christian tradition, Moses, who built the Ark of the Covenant and Jesus renewed God’s contract with humanity. Did this renewal secretly have something to do with the Rainbow Bridge to Tula? In early Greek mythology the Rainbow Goddess and prototype of the Virgin Mary was Isis , the Egyptian Mother of Love, who was called the mother of all the elements . Like the Hindu goddess Maya (Sanskrit for ‘illusion’), she personified the bridge between Earth and Heaven, known as the Rainbow Bridge. Her rainbow symbolized the illusory rainbow veils of perceptible reality. Ever since ancient times, humans have sought to pierce this veil and reveal the secrets of the goddess. Many have thought that all matter was composed of rainbows because, when the sun hit an object (skin, hair, plants, water, stones) just ri ght, it revealed millions of tiny rainbows. The temples dedicated to the Rainbow Goddess throughout the Egyptian and Greek world often featured a carved stone or moon boat (an Ark) containing a figure of a winged or angelic Isis. At Mari, this goddess was depicted wearing blue stones around her neck. These blue stones may have been the blue stones that turned one into an El or a Shining One, a god. To the ancients the meaning of this symbol was nu-clear . The winged Rainbow Goddess was bringing a precious gift to humanity in a boat shaped like an arc. This gift was the secret of the shining sun god.

The tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, particularly the Tree of Life incident, is also of Sumerian origin. According to Sumerian myth, Mari/Inanna rescued the very same Tree of Life from the world flood and planted it in her garden at Mari. This Tree was an axis (Teli) connecting the underworld with Earth and the heavens. 20 It is often described as a pillar or pole connecting Earth and Heaven. In Egypt, it is the Pillar of Osiris. In Christian legend, it is the Cross upon which Christ was crucified. It grew from three seeds from the Tree of Life. In temple depictions Mari is pictured holding two serpents wound around a rod. This caduceus wand was made from a ‘branch’ that grew on the Tree of Life. This symbol was the logo of the priesthood of Therapeutae, or physicians of the soul. It represented the Secrets of Life and connects Mari with the most ancient traditions concerning our galaxy. In The Healing Sun Code I investigated the mythology of these two serpents. It is worth briefly reviewing.

Maya ceremonial leader, Hunbatz Men, says the spiral form of the ‘ G ’ represents the energy of the Milky Way, 23 from which the elemental intergalactic material that forme d their bodies derived. This makes sense. The letter G is a coiled form of the essence ~ symbol. To the Mayans G or ge also represented zero (O), and an egg . 24 When the G appears on the walls of Mayan temples, pyramids, sculptures, or in their codices, says Men, it is a code symbol for the secret Mysteries of the science and religion of the Milky Way, 12 the Cosmic Egg. This is the place of Light and Love (AMOR) from whence our souls originated, and return to, according to a widely held cross-cultural belief. The G or Ge root is evident is several important words. For example, “ gen” means ‘love’ in China. Webster’s defines gen as “to be born, to become.” 20 Saint Genevieve ( Gen Eve ), “the Generator of Life,” is the patron of Paris. Ge is also the mirror image of eg or egg . Here is one of the most astonishing, and illuminating, linguistic connections I have ever encountered. In the same way that Jnana (John) means Wisdom in Sanskrit, Gan-esa or Gen-esa the God of Wisdom of India, is Jan-esa, John-esa, John or Jan, the Savior. Gnia in Irish is Wisdom. Gnia is also Tree (as in Tree of Knowledge). Gnia is evidently Gnosis or Gen-osis, the knowledge of love (AMOR)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 108 John means ‘Dove’ and is derived from Oannes, the Babylonian name for E.A., the lord of Eridu, prefigurer of Christ, and original baptizer. It is now easy to see what occurred when John baptized Jesus. He was communicating the dove or divine wisdom (Genosis) of the Egg to Jesus. The word root gen is the Greek equivalent of gno , from which we derive ‘gnosis’, and importantly, ‘gnoble’ or noble (Aryan). John said, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire . 25 When Jesus was plunged into the Jordan, the fiery energies of the Milky Way, as I have shown earlier, Divine Love ( G or Gen) from the core of the galaxy descended upon him in the form of a dove. The dove is the symbol for the fire, frequency or vibration emanating from the galactic core carrying knowledge. The truly wondrous purpose of baptism was the mystic unification of Heaven and Earth. This is the Great Work of the alchemists. To Isaac Newton, whose ultimate goal was the unio mystica , the substance at the heart of all matter, the prima materia and the Holy Spirit of alchemy was Mercury . 26 He believed it was an ethereal as well as a material substance. Mercury is the name of element number 80 (symbol Hg, atomic weight 200.61), also known as quicksilver. Mercury is also the Roman messenger of the gods who is identified with the Greek Hermes, who is identified with the Egyptian Thoth.

The name Mercury adds to 8. His Greek name Hermes also adds to 8. The Egyptians called him Thoth, Lord of 8. In Greek IEOSUS or Jesus has the value of 888 or 8. The Magic Square of Mercury (8) is the square of 8 or 64. The sum of the numbers 1-64 is 2080, the number of the first- born, an epithet of Jesus. 28 2080 has the same meaning as 1080, which is associated with the words light and fire and the Greek word for Holy Spirit . As Robert Cox tells in The Pillar of Celestial Fire , 29 the tradition of the Holy Spirit has deep roots in the Vedic tradition of the Aryans of India. Like Thoth-Hermes-Elijah , the teacher of this tradition is a divine personage, called Dhanvantari. He appeared at the dawn of Creation. In his hands he holds a pot filled with the Elixer of Immortality. This was his gift to the world. It represented the highest material essence generated during the process of creation, and was said to be capable of producing perfect health, longevity and spiritual enlightenment to all that drank it. It is the same as the pot held by the goddess Mari, and also the quintessence that produced the blue blood. The part of the Ayurveda, the ‘science of longevity’, that deals with the production of this Elixer, is called Rasayana , the Way of Mercury. 30 In Vedic tradition, Mercury (the Holy Spirit) was considered the ultimate key to all alchemical processes. It was considered the most powerful substance.

According to the Vedic tradition, the Mercury or Holy Spirit that the alchemist churns out of the matrix of life is capable of bringing about the perfection of metals and the perfection of the human body. 32 A process of distillation produced this substance. Various types of stills were developed. In the illustration shown here, the alchemical furnace is made of brick into which the vessels holding the liquids for distillation are placed.

Those who held the stone in their mouth developed superhuman powers such as levitation, the ability to transmute matter, and invisibility. These are al l powers that were ascribed to Jesus. According to The Gospel of Mary , one of the Nag Hammadi scrolls, Jesus taught Mary Magdalene secrets that he did not teach the other disciples. Interestingly, severa l Gnostic Christian sects held that Mary Magdalene was the same as the noted first century alchemical author known as Mary the Jewess. If it seems odd that Mary Magdalene was an alchemist, we would be wise to refer to artwork of the ancient Mari wielding the caduceus and the Cretan goddesses shown below. It seems more than apparent that early Christianity was an expression of Mari’s spiritual tradition, and that th is tradition had spiritual alchemy as its foundation. This tradition was firmly rooted in knowledge of the Cube of Space, the Ark or the Net. To early Christian gnostics the Net was an important cosmic symbol.

When we look at it in the night sky, the ‘river’ we are looking along is the edge of a spinning wheel. It is as if we are looking into the silvery hub of a spinning bicycle wheel lying on its side. Earth is on the Orion ‘spoke’ of the Galaxy. A few facts about our galaxy will provide some perspective. The Milky Way is 13-15 billion years old. It contains 100 billion stars. It is 100,000 light years across . As the moon and Earth revolve around the Sun, so too does our entire solar system orbit the galactic center of our galaxy. It takes our sun about 200 million years to complete its orbit of the Galactic Core, which is 23,000 light-years from Earth. The Central Nuclear Bulge (the astrological sign for Libra, symbolizing ‘balance’) of the Milky Way is a mass concentration of stars. Metaphysicians claim this realm of light is the home of the Watchers. It is invisible to the naked eye because its light must travel through thousands of light-years of gas and cosmic dust before it reaches us.

Others claimed it was carried in the beak of the Holy Dove. Others said the Godseed came from the sacred lily in Gabri-El’s hand and was filtered or conducted through the lily into Mary’s body. 35 We should also note that her cosmic resume states Gabri-El is one of four special angels called Seraphim (from ser , meaning “serpent” or “higher being,” and rapha , or “healer”), popularly known as the “fiery flying serpents of lightning.” 36 This wise goddess was originally identified as the Serpent herself.

CORONZON We have explored one purpose of the Net, suggesting that it is a web of life or Ark that serves as a habitat for souls. This Net is a Sea of Glass or Cube of Space, a container of creation that is filled with intelligent matte r. The Net-er gods of Egypt once tended this Cube and its matter. The alchemists apparently possessed the technolog y to separate this matter, and to manipulate this habitat. The Net was the ultimate weapon or technology, a divine instrument ‘that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind’. 1 At the end of the Piscean age, when the Net is full, the angels will draw it to shore, set it down, and gather the good into vessels, but cast the bad away’. 2 The bad will be cast into the fiery furnace. This brings us to the very important question of what is the true significance of the story of a man’s, like Moses’, being drawn out of water in an ark. Is it merely a folk-tale? Or, does this story contain a kernel of immensely powerful cosmic wisdom? What becomes of the fish that are caught? Does the cosmic fisherman return the smaller fish to the Sea of Glass to develop and grow further as souls? Does the Lord keep those who ‘know enough’? Does he pass them on to his successor?"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 120 While we wish to think of this soul’s “looking glass” as benevolent, another purpose of this glass Net is chilling. I t is to keep harmful spirits from entering this plane. Specifically, these angels or “winds,” as Enoch and the Sumerians describe them, prevent the chaotic forces that the Elizabethan mathematician and magician Dr. John Dee called Coronzon (thought to be the true heavenly name of Satan) from entering our world. It may be disturbing, yet it is a fact (one unfortunately not taught by most preachers, priests and rabbis) that the Apocalypse is not God’s wrathful way of destroying humanity. The Apocalypse is a human-made event. Literally, the word means ‘lifting’ the ‘veil’ or ‘gate’ concealing and protecting the secrets of creation. Furthermore, while most consider the horrific, destructive vision of the Apocalypse in the Book of Revelation to be a purely physical event featuring horrendous physical wars, most evidence suggests it is a spiritual process that may manifest as a spiritual event, a personal battle in which the forces of fire and ice ‘crystallize’. The Apocalypse boils down to a battle between the Children of Light and the Children of Darkness -- within each of us. From our human point of view, Apocalypse means ‘lifting the veil or gate’ of consciousness, or increasing o ur spiritual vision. From the cosmic point of view, it envision s the possible take-over of Earth by a group of malevolent beings if the veil of our protective Net is inappropriately lifted. The Net appears to function, in part, as a firewall, a crystalline wall of frequency preventing an onslaught of chaos. Also made clear is the fact that the one and only way"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 121 to let down the firewall for these harmful spirits is from the inside . Bluntly, the wrathful angels of Armageddon must be invited to Earth. The keys to opening the gates to these disincarnate entities must be initiated through an elaborate magical procedure. Many believe this is precisely the system that was delivered to Dr. John Dee (private astrologer and magician to Queen Elizabeth) and the famous scryer Edward Kelly between the years 1582 and 1587. Coronzon (more commonly, but perhaps less correctly, spelled Choronzon) is an angelic being first named in the transcripts of the conversations that took place between Dr . Dee and the hierarchy of spiritual beings who identified themselves as the angels that had instructed the patriarch Enoch in the holy magic of God. According to Dee’s conversation with the archangel Gabri-el, mankind once lived a life of perfect freedom in the Garden of Eden. Of utmost importance was our ability to speak with God directly. This was because we spoke the language of the angels. This language also gave us the ability to converse with animals and nature. It is also calle d the Language of the Birds. 3 The Language of the Birds is a phonetic cabala (or Sabala) that links seemingly unrelated traditions by the sound of words in E n g l i s h . For an investigative mythologist, like me, history remains embedded in language. A good English dictionary is the ultimate digging tool. The meanings of words, particularly those used in sacred texts such as the Bible, are susceptible to interpretation in the Bird Language on at least six different levels: the literal, the historical, the cosmological, the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 122 symbolic/metaphorical, the mythological/allegorical, a nd the anatomical. The connections words draw in English between each of these categories deserve all possible considerations no matter how bird-brained these considerations and connections may at first seem. Take for instance the linguistic variations of the Language of the Birds. It is called the language of poets or bards (birds), linking it with the bards of Druid tradition. Myths from Celtic Ireland tell of these Druid shamans who were called Bards (birds) or Ollaves (which calls to mind the olive branch of peace) and were revered not just as poets, but as Peacemakers. According to Irish tradition and the writings of Diodorous Siculus (pronounced Skill-Us), often on the battlefields, at the very moment when the armies approach each other with swords raised the brightly dressed bard (bird) would appear, speak a word of power and peace would immediately ensue. “It was if they had cast a spell over wild beasts,” wrote Siculus. Even the brutal Roman armies of the 600’s were filled with awe and terror at the sight of them. According to myth, the bard had more spiritual power than any priest did. Another linguistic variation of ‘ bard ’ or ‘ bird ’ is ‘ bud ’ ( blas-tula in Greek), a verb meaning ‘to cause to bud, germinate, sprout’. Allowing for the substitution of bards , birds , and buds renders the poetic Language of the Birds as the Language of the Buds (or flowers). The Buds are also the Budd-has. ‘Buddha’ comes from the Sanskrit budh , meaning ‘ to awaken ’. 4 In this way the definition of the Bird Language rolls into the Buddha’s ‘language that awakens’."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 123 As I demonstrated in my book The Language of the Birds , Jesus also used this language. And why not? The mysterious 20 th century French alchemist “Fulcanelli” called the Bird Language the ‘language of the gods’. 5 He also said it is the language of alchemy, also known as the Green Language. According to lore, the Language of the Birds was created miraculously by God as a gift to Adam in the Garden of Eden. With this language Adam was given command over the elements of nature (the secret science of alchemy). This included the Periodic Table of Elements. It could not be read or understood without knowing the symbolic key. With the key in hand one would gain access to the inner secrets of scripture, and to the secrets of creation, the Book of Life. Coronzon envied this status. He tempted humanity to use our ‘lesser’ (sexual) parts. As a consequence humanity was evicted from the Garden. The language of the angels was lost. Humanity was rendered “as dumb, and not able to speak” and of necessity began to learn a new less perfect language in order to express his thoughts and needs. Gabri-el declares that the Enochian angels will restore to mankind through Dee and Kelly the angelic language “which Adam verily spake in innocence, and was never uttered nor disclosed to man since till now.” The system is known as Enochian Magic or the Keys of Enoch, after the Old Testament prophet. Dee never attempted to use the Keys. Kelly, on the other hand, tried to use the Keys to unlock the secret of manufacturing gold (which by some accounts he succeeded in doing). Both men appear to have been ignorant of the true power of their"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 124 work, although it should not go unnoticed that Kelly frequently left Dee, on the grounds that he thought Dee’s angels were devils in disguise. Dee’s personal notebooks were ultimately burned. Only the Keys survived. Two hundred and fifty years later Dee and Kelly’s Keys were dusted off and implemented by the infamous magician Alestair Crowley (in 1904). Crowley not only believed he was the reincarnated Edward Kelly, but also the “Great Beast” of the Book of Revelation. He saw Armageddon as a practical matter of opening the gate(s) of the Sea of Glass to the souls or spirits of Coronzon. Fortunately, most do not believe Crowley was entirely successful in opening all four gates protecting Earth. He only opened it one crack, allowing these spirits in. Today, some believe, these spirits act on the astral level, possessing human beings and treating them like puppets. The appearance of Crowley, and soon after of Adolf Hitler, as evil personified may have been in perfect accord with universal time. The Talmud teaches that “the Spirit depends on the stormwind .” The stormwind relates to the stormy state of consciousness that precedes the true mystical experience, which is called the Holy Spirit. The Talmud also states that the state of Sa’arah is the gateway to the mystical experience. One of the primary symbols in Tibetan Buddhism is the Wheel of Rebirth called Sam-sara .

Otto Rahn, the man sent by Heinrich Himmler to find the Grail, ultimately wrote that he believed it was in the crystal halls of the Sabarthez in a holy crystal cathedral of the Cathars that the Grail secrets were housed. The Language of the Birds is said to enable us to leap from the ‘outer’ world to the ‘inner’ world. This is a crucial leap to make to understand the esoteric secrets of the Grail. In fact, the Kor-An calls this leap ‘the Bridge of Sirah ’ (phonetically Sa’arah ). As Schwaller de Lubicz says, “It is as wide as a razor’s edge; on either side is a yawning gulf of perdition...” 6 “One precipice,” he says, “is the mentality of logical or mathematical reason, the other of superstition.” I interpret this to mean that on one precipice is our ordinary world where things are as they seem. This is the world of our logical left brain. On the other side of this leap is the “looking glass,” an intuitive right-brained world where things are not at all what they seem, and where the modern language of English is the key to unlocking the secrets in the ancient world.

One excellent starting place for learning t o lift our tone and to connect with the energies of Christ’s Court comes from the Talmud, which states that the state of Sa’arah depends on the Arms of the Universe. In early Egyptian cosmology the sky was held to be the body of Nut represented as the body of a giant woman. She is the Lady of the Lake, or Sea of Glass, of the Grail tradition. In the Sepher Yetzirah , the oldest and most mysterious book of Hebrew mystery teachings, the Kaballah, we find a description of the creation of the boundaries of Nut by the Divine Mind ( Nous in Greek). 1 These boundaries set this part of space apart from the rest of the Cosmic Ocean. The region in Nut’s body, in the interior of the sky, is the Tuat. As Jeremy Naydler observes, it is less an Underworld than an innerworld . It is floating in the waters of the heavens. 2 Nut’s two legs and her two arms, which were the four pillars of heaven , supported her.

In Chapter 32 of the Book of Enoch the scribe arrives in the Garden of Righteousness where he is shown a glorious tree ‘like the species of the tamarind tree’, bearing fruit that resembled grapes . 5 The angel Raphael, who is with Enoch, tells him that this is the tree of knowledge of which Adam and Eve ate, and who, obtaining knowledge had their eyes opened. In other words, they had the ‘veil’ removed. In my book Blue Apples , I concluded that the creation of a ‘(star) gateway to God’ is precisely the result of the Crucifixion. In mystic southern France, where the term Blue Apples originated, it stands for a cluster of grapes. Intriguingly, amulets in the form of a cluster of grapes represented the human heart in Egyptian tradition. For instance, in the work known as the “Tale of Two Brothers” the heart of the protagonist is described as iarret : “a bunch of grapes.” This word iarret is tantalizingly similar to arrit and ararat , the gateway to the crystal halls of Christ’s Court. As a result of his opening of this gateway Jesus retrieved powerful esoteric knowledge, symbolized by the cluster of grapes. The Church of Rome suppressed this knowledge. However, Gnostic priesthoods, which at first included the family of Jesus, including Mary Magdalene, and later the alchemists passed it along.

Nun is the ‘hidden’ or ‘black’ matter that forms 9/10 of the universe. 7 Understanding of Nun causes awakening to the secrets of the foundations of life itself. It inaugurates an Apocalypse. It is vital to realize that we are made of this elemental galactic material, or ‘star stuff’. El-e-mental means ‘mind’ ( mental ) of ( El ), Hebrew for ‘God’, is e (‘E = mc 2 ’). This statement infers that all physical existence first had a mental existence in the mind of God. To repeat, Nu is the same as Nous , meaning ‘knowledge’, which is Gnosis or Gen-osis . In 1891 Berenger Sauniere, a nearly destitute Catholic priest, discovered a cache of parchments claimed to be of ancient pedigree when he refurbished the dilapidated Church of Mary Magdalene at Rennes-le-Chateau in Southern France (Rennes is French for reindeer). Legend and scientific proof hint that humans have been hiking up the steep hill of this remote village in the Pyrenees and stashing the white-hot secrets of the ages here ever since the Stone Age. One of the parchments Sauniere discovered contained a cipher that ended with the words “at noon Blue Apples.” As I investigated in Blue Apples , the Blue Apples symbolize the secrets of Rennes-le-Chateau. As a result of his discovery of the secret of the Blue Apples, Sauniere reputedly became immensely and inexplicably wealthy,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 137 spending enormous sums refurbishing the Church of Mary Magdalene, including installing some rather interesting stained glass windows. At precisely noon on January 17 the Sun’s rays, low on the horizon, pass directly through the patterns on one of these stained glass windows and project onto the opposite wall a tree covered with round fruit resembling apples. 8 This stunning effect takes on a remarkable significance as the Sun moves through the room. As it moves from left to right, the fruits change from blue to red, all except for three of them, which remain blue . This spectacular effect is short lived. It becomes blurred and then disappears completely. The message of the parchments and the intention of the priest’s glass windows are clear. The secrets of the Tree of Knowledge (which is the Word ) and its three Blue Apples are hidden in Southern France in Cathar country. This cluster of grapes also appears in the Bible in what I consider one of the strangest and most illuminating storie s ever told. I have discussed this episode in detail in Blue Apples . However, new insights have come to me, which are appropriate to explore in this context. Provocatively, this episode involves a group of beings called Anak or Anakim . These were among the children of the Nephilim, which explains why they are described as fair-skinned, blond and tall in stature. (Curiously, the na me Enoch comes from Hanoch , which without the ‘H’ is Anoch or Anak.) They are also identified as the children of Amor. In the episode in question, 9 Moses dispatched Joshua, son of Nun , and a companion, Caleb, to the valley of"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 138 Eschol (‘valley of the cluster’ as in grapes) to spy on the sons of Anak who were living there. In a story reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, we learn that when the two spies arrived at the land of the giants they stole a branch heavy with grapes from the Anak. They returned the large grapes to Moses. These blue apples are so large it takes two men to carry them. 10 The cluster of grapes later became cryptograms that were extremely important to the Essenes, the priesthood of which Jesus was a member, and the Gnostic Grail heretics, including the Cathars, that they held sacred and secret. Two facts make this episode so astounding to me. First, the two thieves were later connected with the two thieves crucified along side Jesus at the Crucifixion. In order to appreciate this connection, the second fact, a mind- boggling bit of intelligence regarding the vineyards of the Anak discovered by Moses’ spies, must be explored. Upon their return the spies reported that the Anak were big in stature. 11 This appears to be a factual account as the Anak were described as not only tall, but also well armed. This alone would be good reason to follow God’s advice and not to go trotting on their territory. But the Israelite spies reported another even more terrifying (and, therefor e to us, a more remarkable) reason for staying out of the Anak’s vineyards. That is this: “ the land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof ”.... and we were in our own site as grasshoppers . 12 What a strange and stimulating observation. The first thing that catches my attention about this statement is that, once again, humans are described as"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 139 ‘grasshoppers’. This bizarre description is the same as tha t found in Isaiah, “It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in...” Why does God see his human creation as grasshoppers? Why, when Joshua encounters the ‘sons of God’, do they hold the same image of humanity? What is the significance of this description in relation to the statement that the lan d of Eschol, the home of the Anak, eateth up its inhabitants? Some think that there was a great plague in the country at the time that Joshua surveyed it. If so, why shroud this simple fact in obscure language? People in ancient times certainly knew the meaning of the word plague. In the book of Exodus, which recounts Moses’ dual with the Pharaoh’s magicians immediately before their encounter at Eschol, God unleashed plagues and they were accurately reported. Another interpretation is that the land did not provide enough food for its people, an interpretation that contradicts the belief that this was the land of milk and honey. The cryptic phrase, “ the land eateth up the people thereof ” must have a more fantastic explanation. In fact, because of the imprecise language, it must refer to something the spies did not quite understand. This had to be something powerful. Joshua was considered a mighty and brave warrior. What could it possibly be that terrified him? What eats people and makes them disappear from the face of the Earth? It would be easy to say the spies saw either a space ship (which in this case they could not imagine, therefore they"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 140 could not see). If so, they could have said they saw a “cloud,” a term used dozens of times in the Bible during episodes that are strikingly similar to modern day UFO sightings. If they saw an inner Earth opening that consumed people, they could easily have said they saw a cave. Deuteronomy says that Joshua was “full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him.” 13 So, when he said “the land eateth the people up,” and he saw either individuals or a group of people disappearing into thin air leading him to believe the land consumed them, Joshua must have seen something that only those initiated by Moses could understand. We now have a word for what Joshua saw: stargate or wormhole. My interpretation of the mystery of the Anak’s Blue Apples, which I have also fully investigated in my books Blue Apples and also The Healing Sun Code , asks us to imagine the opening of such a gateway is not some fantasy. It is an actual event that took place in the vineyards of Eschol. As it was the children of An who were operating this gateway, and they are the same as the beings who operated the Sea of Glass, we may speculate that this gateway led to the crystal halls of the realm of the gods. The New Testament says this is Christ’s Court. Whoever the esoteric artist was that crafted the depiction of the two thieves at the Crucifixion on the next page, his or her agreement with my hypothesis is crystal clear. For certain the artist meant to connect the story of Joshua and Caleb stealing the Blue Apples from the An with the Crucifixion of Jesus."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 141 Christ as the Blue Apples.

Two people were known to flank this third person that stands upon a cross, a gateway. The sun and moon symbols can be seen above him. There is a good reason for connecting Joshua and Jesus.

Thus, Jesus was given his name, and the symbol of the fish, , in an effort to connect him to the mystical tradition of the Blue Apples or because he fulfilled, in the eyes of his Nazorean or Essene followers, the prototype of Joshua. From our investigation , we know that the term Nun connects Jesus with Nu . It is of great interest to me that the Egyptian hieroglyph of the heron, the bird of light ( akh ) , so closely matches the stylized fish glyph of Jesus , though it predates him by millennia. In addition, these two symbols are structurally identical to , the mathematical sign sometimes used for infinity, which spells Oc . This fuses the Language of the Birds (the heron) and the Language of Oc, the language code that the Cathars used to decode the secrets of Jesus, i.e. the nu -clear secrets of light. French authors have proposed the Grail, along with other secrets, was in the possession of the Cathars who lived in the Languedoc region of Southern France. Camelot (“ curved light” ) may also be here. This region was named after the Language of Oc. In 1163 this group of souls, who called themselves good Christians or Pure Ones and their church the Church of AMOR or Love, were condemned by the Council of Tours as heretics for their alternative versi on of the life and teachings of Jesus. They said they derived this teaching from a special language system, the Language of Oc, which is the name of their home in France, the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 144 L’angue doc, that they used to interpret a secret gospel of Jesus called the Gospel of Love . They called the land of the immortals AMOR, love. They said Jesus came from this place. 29 He had come to lead his sheep out of the evil confines of Earth, called ROMA (AMOR’s mirror image) by the Cathars. AMOR is the ‘land of love’, the home of the Saba. Another way of saying this would be that Amor is the land of Gen (Chinese for love). Gen is the Mayan word for the Egg of the Milky Way. Intriguingly, the r e n root of Rennes-le-Chateau means secret name-soul in Egypt. The ren soul was kept secret so that evil spirits could not possess it. The goddess Renenet, who gave the child this secret name along with its mother’s milk, sometimes she wore a lion head. The Egyptian hieroglyph for Renenet includes an egg. 15 All of these connections, the egg, the secret name, the cat, tie-in with the concept of the Ka, the hidden Divine Soul, that resides in the center of the Milky Way and the Cathars seeming ability to connect with this soul. In her wonderful work The Refuge of the Apocalypse , 16 author Elizabeth van Buren says the Gospel of Love is thought to contain Jesus’ “most sublime teachings, marvelous revelations, the most secret words confided by Jesus to his beloved disciple.” This disciple is thought to be John the Divine, whose house in Jerusalem served as the location for the Last Supper. Their power, observes Ms. Van Buren, would be such that all hatred, all anger, all jealousy would vanish from the hearts of men. Human suffering would end."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 145 According to Ms. Van Buren, the valley of Eschol where the Ana operated the stargate was also located near Rennes-le-Chateau. The painting by Nicholas Poussin depicts the two thieves, Joshua and Caleb, returning the grapes of the Promised Land, the Blue Apples, to Moses. A man standing on a ladder that appears to be emerging from the grapes can be seen. Supposing that “noon Blue Apples” refers not to a time, but a place, yields a powerful connection between Enoch and the mystery of Rennes. The difference between Joshua and Jesus is that the former is not known to have used the technology stolen from the gods. Jesus did. Like Joshua, Jesus was hailed as the one who led the people of Israel successfully into the “Promised Land.” This last term, the Promised Land, thus becomes code for travel out of the Net to the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the world of Light and Love. An important Sumerian myth of the Ana interpreted by Sitchin describes the opening of such a gateway through which a god ascended to Heaven. 17 In a morning-time ceremony in which the Lord, Anu, departs Earth, Enki and Enlil, two sons of Anu, await Anu at what is called the “ golden supporter .” They hold several objects: “that which opens up the secrets,” “the Sun disks,” and the “splendid shining posts.” The “golden supporter” device is sheathed in a golden skin (as is the Pillar of Osiris). Anu and his wife, Antu, stand before the golden supporter, the Pillar or Tree of Life. The device comes alive, the gate swings open and Anu and Antu enter the Abyss (sometimes called the Fish of Isis)."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 146 \u0001 Incredibly, Zecharia Sitchin has recovered what may be depictions of this scene.

The two guards (transformed into thieves in the New Testament) hold devices, long poles with circular tops, which Sitchin concludes served an astronomical purpose. He also equates them with golden pillars at the entrance to Solomon’s Temple. 18 I, of course, view them as the two thieves. Anu enters the gateway. © Z. Sitchin. With this technology Jesus possessed both the spiritual and technological means to travel from our world to the galactic core and to transmute any form of matter into any other form. He also possessed the ability to transmute the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 147 human element into a higher form. Numerous traditions say that the celestial beings that inhabit the Central Healing Sun do not possess fleshy physical bodies. They possess luminous bodies that are composed of pure crystallized matter. Regarding these divine beings the ancient Indian Vedic texts say: The gods, the never-slumbering beholders of mankind, who are entitled (to know the secrets of life and light), have obtained great immortality; conveyed in chariots (or bodies) of light, possessed of unsurpassable wisdom, devoid of sin, they inhabit the exalted station of heaven for the well-being (of all humanity). 19 The transition from human flesh, which is in part composed of crystal, into the pure crystallized bodies of th e luminous divine beings described here brings up another possible interpretation of the bizarre phrase, “the land eateth the people up.” This interpretation comes from the alchemical principle of palingenesis , from Pala (the root of Palladium and Pala-to or Plato) and genesis, meaning metempsychosis or reincarnation. According to Manly P. Hall, to the Pythagoreans the term palingenesis was used to indicate the rebirth of the universe from its periodic sleep or t he replenishment of the Earth after a cataclysm, such as the Flood .” 20 Remember that the mineral content of the Earth circulates through the vegetal and animal kingdom. Alchemists see the eating of the realms as one substance of the Earth superseding another.

No form disappears completely; when destroyed, there remains the physical residue of mineral salt. These higher biological forms, in turn, are ‘eaten’ by yet another higher realm. This alchemical process is what we see occurring at Eschol when “the land eateth the people up.” Actually, it is the gods who are eating humanity. They probably are not cannibals. However, metaphysically speaking, we must be open to the possibility that what the gods were teaching humanity was actually the means to transform themselves into gods. Hence, the land or the gods ‘eateth’ the people up. If Jesus used this technology at the Crucifixion, as I have proposed in Blue Apples , this was an esoteric event in which he demonstrated his knowledge of the Blue Apples, i.e. the secrets of Nu, Nous or John, the El-e-mental substance of which we are made. He used this knowledge to transmute himself into a higher being. It was also a stargate event in which the crucified Jesus wandered out of the Sea of Glass. This is reflected in the apocryphal tradition where Jesus spends three days in the ‘underworld’. These three days are symbolized by time in the belly of a fish: “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth .” 21 In my book The Healing Sun Code I presented fantastic Christian art that depicted Jesus meandering through or crossing the waters of life.

THE CENTER Numerous myths, which I have documented elsewhere, describe our souls as emerging from the heart center or core of our whirling Milky Way galaxy. 1 This, as I have said, is the presumed location of Christ’s Court. Souls fanned out into four directions from this core, which was called Tula or Thule by the ancients. According to myth, the transparent Cube floating in the sea of space is our soul’s temporary home. When one reads the scripture and stories concerning the Core and the Cube one must keep in mind that they almost always infer a dual correspondence. Literary references to events, places, people and things on Earth have a direct correspondence to spiritually resonant events, places, people and things in the Core. The Core of our galaxy, in turn, is in similar relationship to the Core of our Universe. In this way the ancient texts link humans on Earth with the presence of the divine beings that inhabit the Core of our galaxy and the Core of our Universe. Most traditional religions claim one or more sacred sites as marking a central ‘heart’ or ‘navel’ of the Earth. These sites give access to the Core. In almost every instance, access to the Core is associated with a sacred mountain, pillar, tree, spring, cave or a black or hidden stone of light. Jesus was crucified upon a pillar or Cross of"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 152 Life. When he exited the Earth it was, according to early traditions, from the rarely mentioned Cave of Ascension near the summit of the Mount of Olives. 2 The same cave also appears in the Crucifixion account in the apocryphal gospel of John. He is the initiate among the disciples. In this episode he is the witness or the Watcher. This Gnostic text tells how, during the time of the Crucifixion, John goes to the Mount of Olives and enters a cave. There he encounters the figure of Christ standing before him, his presence illuminating the darkness of the enclosure. Jesus gives John the vision of a Cross of Light and teaches him about its cosmic significance “This cross... is that which joined all things unto itself by the Word... and then also, being one, made all things flow forth.” 3 In this remarkable encounter we have the images of the mountain, the Cross and the cave. Most importantly, we note that the cross is a Cross of Light. Otherwise known as the enclosed Sun Cross , this cross is the symbol for the Core and its four rivers of life. It is the Cross of Life, and the symbol for that which both unites and enables creation. It is a ‘squared circle’. In The Book of Jubilees we are told that the Garden of Eden is the holy of holies, and the dwelling of the Lord, and Mount Sinai is the center of the desert and Mount Moriah or Meru, also called Sion, the center of the navel of the Earth. 4 Solomon’s Temple, the magnificent temple built by Solomon atop Mount Moriah to house the Ark of the Covenant had for its Holy of Holies a perfect cube. If Solomon’s Holy of Holies is a copy of Eden, then we may"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 153 surmise that the Garden of Eden was cube-shaped, if not the Cube of Space itself. The Holy of Holies housed the Ark of the Covenant. It was entered on only one day of the year: the Day of Atonement. The veil was not split on any other day. According to the Book of Exodus, 6 this veil was made of blue, purple and scarlet linen. It was made with (or by) angels and it hung from four pillars of wood overlaid with gold. It simultaneously shielded and connected the High Priest with God. As we can see, this description of the Holy of Holies as a protective enclosure supported by four pillar s describes a miniature golden Cube of Space (ala Tut’s ark). The protective veil is known as the veil or gate revealed by the Apocalypse in the book of Revelation. Jesus taught daily at the Temple of Solomon. 6 During the Crucifixion, the ‘veil’ within the Holy of Holies of the Temple was split in half revealing God’s presence. 7 When we view these word fossils as a whole it seems Jesus had a powerful linguistic connection with some kind of apocalyptic Pillar which split open a gate to God, creating a moment of Peace in which the Cube of Space opened and God was revealed from ‘far away’. The notion that this grid or Net contains the Holy Spirit is fascinating given that some maintain the word ‘grail’ may come from the Latin cratus (or ‘crater’) which rendered the low Latin craticula or gradella (a ‘grid’ or ‘grill’). 8 This peculiar definition, the Grail is a grid, aligns it with the four-cornered world, which, itself is a grid.

We are not surprised to learn that this jewel is seen as a clear crystal or diamond known as the Mani stone. 11 It is the source of the Hindu philosopher’s stone, the source of the elixir Soma that bestows spiritual vision and immortality. Alchemists called the Grail the Philosopher’s Stone and said it is cubic in shape. The essence of this stone is extracted from the first matter, prima materia or “mother substance,” Nu . Once again, Nu is Nous (wisdom), another name for Thoth (or Thought-h), who became Elijah , who became John (wisdom), who delivered the dove of the Holy Spirit, Mercury, to Jesus.

In this piece of Hollywood alchemy Kubrick introduces the Black Stone in the form of a monolith (‘stone of light’) that comes to Earth from the stars and brings a technological enlightenment to a dim-bulbed apeman’s tribe who lives “at the dawn of humanity”. The appearance of the monolith causes the apeman to use a bone in a way heretofore unimagined. The bone becomes a weapon used in the first murder. This is an obvious reference to the biblical story of Cain, who murdered his brother Abel and went on to create the first civilization. 16 Its symbolism alerts us to pay attention. Kub- rick (or Cube Rock) is speaking in the language of myth. In one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, the proto-human throws the bone (the murder weapon) into the sky. In the blink of an eye it transforms into a spaceship twirling gracefully in space. Kubrick has just delivered an eloquent and stunning subliminal message. By skipping over all of human history, he seems to be saying that no human history occurred (or mattered) in between the apeman’s discovery of the Black Stone and what is about to happen in the movie. The timeframe shifts to 2001 when the Black Stone is discovered buried on the Moon by a technologically advanced human civilization. This time Kubrick’s message is loud and clear. Human history turns on the sudden appearance of the Christ Stone. The Cube from space is the guide of human development. Here again Kubrick has torn a page straight out of the Bible.

In 2001 the monolith holds the promise of higher spiritual ability. Of course, the discovery of its existence is suppressed by the powers that be. “I’m sure you are aware of the extremely grave potential for social shock and disorientation caused by this information. We can’t release it without proper conditioning,” says Dr. Heywood Floyd, who discovers the Christ Stone on the moon in the movie. 2001 is not a movie about a conspiracy theory. This movie is the eloquent story of the Christ Stone and its overwhelming power to force us to ask questions, and to bring advancement and connection with a higher intelligence from the stars. As Kubrick so movingly conveys in the film, the Christ Stone also brings up the darker side of humanity for purification. Humankind’s murderous tendencies (along with its religious and politic al leader’s propensity to withhold life-altering spiritual information from the masses) must be transcended. In 2001 this intelligence and purifying agent ultimately manifests in the form of Dave Bowman, an astronaut who is transformed after he peers deep into the Christ Stone. Like Hammarskjold’s stone of light at the UN, when Bowman looks into the monolith he remarks in a rapturous tone, “My God, it’s full of stars.” Though the meaning of this famous movie statement is not revealed (it perpetually leaves movie goers perplexed), Bowman appears to be at"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 163 the center of the galaxy partaking of the view of the Sea of Glass afforded by Christ’s throne.

The Greek word for stone is Cephas or Kephas . Kephas is from Ke-phalos (phonetically Key -Phallus), meaning head . (Note the association between the tone, head, and the skull.) This is the original name for St. Peter (from petros , meaning ‘rock’), the Galilean fisherman who became Jesus’ chief disciple and the (rock) Head upon which Christ will build his church. 3 By this interpretation, the (S)tone, the Healing Sun, is the Head of the Church. To Christians, Christ, not Peter, is the missing stone or Head of the Church. To Gnostic Christians, Christ is the missing Skill or wisdom of the Church. In the Clementine Homilies Simon Peter, the chief disciple of John the Baptist, teaches the cosmic doctrine of the Cris (Black) Stone of Light and the Cross: There proceeds from God, the heart of the world, indefinite extension – upwards and downwards, to the right and left, backward and forward. Looking in these six directions, as at a constant number, he completes the creation of the world, of which he is the beginning and the end. In him the six phase of time have their end, and it is from him that they receive their indefinite extension.

According to Gematria, the number of Earth life is six; the number of the Heaven is eight. That is because a cube has six sides and eight corners. This center point is called the Rock of Living Waters, the Philosopher’s Stone, the Stone of Sure Foundation, and the Pearl of Great Price or the jewel. 3 The center of the Grail is the center of the Cube, from whence the vibrating flame with ‘tongues of fire’ that left Enoch awestruck emanated. It is the crystal Court of Christ. In terms of sacred geometry, this remarkable passage demonstrates a set of cosmic relationships that are expressed in the symbol of the six-pointed cross known to early Christians.

The cosmic ocean surrounds this island. This region of space sprang into modern scientific consciousness in 1932 when Karl Jansky, an engineer working at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey (another Meru word), was attempting to locate the source of irritating background noise heard on trans- Atlantic telephone calls. He fashioned the first radio antenna and discovered that the core of our galaxy, was the source of the pesky emissions. With his discovery Jansky inaugurated the field of radio astronomy. After WW II, other scientists continued developing the field of radio astronomy, which has led to such wondrous discoveries as quasars, pulsars, as well as the discovery of a black hole and a white hole located at the galactic center. The ‘Big Bang’ theory of creation and the expanding universe, the realization that we live in a ‘garden’ of over one trillion galaxies similar to our own, followed on the heels of Jansky’s discovery. At exactly the same time Janksy made his discovery, another future Bell Labs physicist and fire-wielding Prometheus, William Shockley, was studying physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There he dived headlong into the weird Wonderland of quantum mechanics, where particles and waves interchanged with one another, and began to understand how streams of electrons trickle through crystalline materials such as a cube of ordinary table salt.

The original firestone was a large cylindrical glass cut with facets and had a capstone. The firestone of Atlantis “was in the form of a six-sided figure” and “set as a crystal.” 10 Curiously, or perhaps not, the six-sided Atlantean firestone perfectly describes the symbolism shared by the quartz crystal, the computer chip and the symbolism of Solomon’s Temple. Silicon atoms arrange in the same hexagonal pattern like ice and grow as a six-sided quartz crystal. Quartz crystals formed of silicon and oxygen are hexagonal (six- sided) structures that have the unique property of piezoelectricity... which means that they create electricit y when stimulated electronically or by pressure. This power can be measured. Because of its piezoelectricity, Quartz crystal can receive energy, process it, and then transmit th e oscillations outward in precise vibration patterns. These vibration patterns can be manipulated to augment, store, amplify, transfer, transform and focus other rates of vibration...i.e. information. 11 The word “quartz” is German; the word “crystal” is derived from the Greek word “krystallos”, meaning ice. Ice is frozen water. When the pressure of fire meets water crystal is formed. Occultists believe fire and ice represent the two polarities within. Quartz is the low-temperature stable form of silicon dioxide or silica. Quartz crystal contains 46% silicon and 53% oxygen.

THE CHRIST STONES WITHIN This idea of the corner stone is the foundation of Freemasonry. It is unintelligible unless one realizes that the ‘corner-stone’ refers to the keystone of the Freemasonic arch , itself a reference to the Rainbow Bridge of the goddess Isis. This “Bridge of Love” is built from within with (s)tones that emerge from within us. Fascinatingly, the King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid stand in relation to each other as do the pineal gland and pituitary gland of the brain. Pineal was the name of the place where Jacob saw God face to face. The subterranean system underneath the Pyramid represents the solar plexus. As I explored in my book God Making , the solar plexus corresponds with the Ark of the Covenant, the golden container that housed the Tablets or (S)tones of God. This tone is taken up to the brain by the nerves or branches of the Pneumo gastric nerve, the ‘light nerve’, and becomes the “fruit of the Tree of Life” in the pineal gland.

The Optic Thalamus, meaning, “light of the chamber” 1 is the inner or"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 186 third eye, situated at the center of the head (and at the top of the pyramid above). It connects the pineal gland and the pituitary body. The optic nerve starts from this “eye single ” or “All Seeing Eye.” “If thine eye be single, thy whole body will be full of light.” The Optic Thalamus is called a “lamp,” and indicates “rays,” “light,” or “vibration.” 2 By activating the third eye millions of dormant cells of the brain are resurrected and set in motion (vibration). The brain is attuned to higher spiritual vibrations. The Eye of spiritual understanding i s opened. Sin is overcome. Like Mari wearing her Shugurra ‘helmet of salvation’, we are capable of travelling far into the universe. In the Orient, the two serpents of skill are found within the human body. They wind around seven levels of psychophysical transformation known as “chakras,” which are knots or zones of energy that must be “untied” to achieve enlightenment. They are variously described as gates that open, wheels that are set spinning, or lotuses tha t bloom as the healing energy of Tula rises up the spine. In Tantric alchemy of India, there are seven major knots (or notes ) located along the spine. The goal is to unite the Atman (female soul) at the base of the spine with the Brahman (Ra man or male soul) at the top of the spine into a unified single presence: the (S)tone or Diamond body, also known as the Coat Of Many Colors.

The seventh heaven (chakra) is at the crown of the head, or more precise, slightly above the head. The ancients believed that when we were born this was the “open door” through which our consciousness entered and through which we communicate with the Spirit. It is no coincidence that Jesus said, “I am the door.” In Sanskrit this is called “The Door of Brahm,” 3 for it is the opening through which the Spirit comes and goes. It is also the chimney of Santa Claus. Santa Claus, or Saint Claus, is derived from the same root word as “claustrum,” 4 meaning barrier, a covered place, and seclusion, especiall y something holy. The suture of the skull, where the bones meet, is called the claustrum. The claustrum is a thin sheet of gray matter. The vertebrae as a unit are called the “stick of Braham,” or the Shushusmna. When Santa Claus shimmies down this chimney he brings with him a secretion, a substance , that is a wonderful gift, the essence or quintessence of life. Directly underneath the “door of Brahm” is a triangular-shaped body named in physiology the “Island of Reil.” This island is the central lobe of the cerebrum, and is called the Pole. Hence the Island of Reil is the North Pole of the body. It is the pure land of AMOR, or the island of Tula, which is beyond the north wind (pole). Known as the Thousand-Petaled Lotus, this island is associated with the pituitary gland of the brain. The pituitary (feminine) is opposite the (masculine) pineal gland. They form ‘pillars’ on either side of the Thalamus in the head. The pineal is cone shaped, and secretes a yellow"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 189 or golden fluid. The pituitary is ellipsoid in shape, and contains a whitish secretion, like milk. These secret fluids are called milk and honey in the Gospels. Connected with the pineal gland is a nerve called the “pingala.” This nerve crosses the spinal cord at the base of the skull, in the medulla oblongata, and follows down the right side of the spinal cord to its end (see above). Its compliment, connected with the pituitary gland, is the nerve Ida, which crosses the spinal cord at the same place where the Pingala crosses, follows down the left side of the spinal cord to its base. Here the two nerves converge into the body through the semi-luna ganglion, where they merge into the solar plexus. The Thalamus is egg-shaped, a fact which explains why the egg was so prominently featured in so many ancient myths, including the Easter egg. When viewed in cross- sections of the brain, the thalamus looks exactly like the scarabaeus beetle of Egypt. The Egyptians featured the scarab pushing a dung ball representing the Egg of the World. Within it are the eggs of the beetle’s offspring representing a pupal phase. The scarab pushes before him the light of the Sun characterized by the life that emanates from it. The Key of Life represents this light and its tones. In this way the scarab (the thalamus) is the light-bringer. It illuminates the crystal halls of Christ’s Court.

As Schwaller de Lubicz said of Egyptian symbolism, “the further back you can see, the farther ahead also.” The primary symbol is the Net. A secondary symbol is the scarab beetle. Seeing how these ancient memes, myths, symbols and archetypes replay themselves in modern events and mass human consciousness, it seems to me, will help us bring focus to our present unfoldment in our new millennium. These signs and stories are like Ariadne’s golden thread. Once grasped, they can show us the way through the labyrinth of Apocalypse. They will help us lift the veil and open the gate. The alternative, say the myths, is a good old-fashioned, cataclysmic destruction -- this time by fire. Where is our civilization in the cosmic scheme of things? Remember the seed that turns into a flower? Remember the caterpillar that turns into a beautiful butterfly? Like the seed, the caterpillar must take a journe y into a dark world to become the butterfly. Must humanity do the same? Have you noticed things getting kind of dark lately? Almost like we have created an egg around us? We cannot remain in the egg forever. No way. We are not the Chosen Frozen. Our destiny is to bust out of this darkness. What’s next? Let’s follow the beetle and find out. According to the Egyptian texts, the dung ball the scarab is pushing must be deposited inside the Earth to incubate for twenty-eight days, the exact number of days it takes the Moon to pass through the twelve signs of the zodiac. From out of the scarab emerges a ‘serpent’, the symbol for new life and for wisdom. This serpent next finds its way to the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 191 heart or navel of the Earth. The navel of the Earth, or omphalos , was seen as the source of all things, the ‘Temple of the Womb’ where the Goddess and the God, as serpent, mated. After this, the dung ball emerges as an eight-petaled lotus, the flower of life , which represents the Goddess in her loving, nurturing aspect. As the metamorphosis concludes we see a human figure seated on a flying serpent (see earlier depictions) amidst the stars. This is likely not a serpent at all. Rather, it is a symbol for something far more provocative, something that is one of the most important secrets of all time. What is it? Two powerful possibilities present themselves. In Hebrew the root NHSH is used in nahash , serpent, and nashamah , soul. This serpent could be a new soul coming to Earth. Another possibility comes from the Mayans who prophesied that during Earth transition in the 2012 a ‘serpent rope’ would come out of the sky, and would provide a ladder to Heaven. To borrow a term from modern physics, the Mayans appear to be saying a ‘wormhole’ or ‘stargate’ will appear. I like to use the Egyptian example for the reason that Schwaller de Lubicz believed the Egyptians thought completely differently from us. The entire social philosophy of Egypt was geared toward effecting a mass transmutation of their civilization from a lower state -- fi rst the egg, then the dung ball -- to a higher state which enabled the return home. This transmutational focus was so prominent that even Upper Egypt, itself, was known to the Greeks as the land of Khem (the root for ‘chemistry’), the land of alchemy or transmutation, or Khemennu , ‘Land of the Moon’."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 192 As I see it, ancient Egypt might as well have been called the Land of Grail Consciousness.

Strange as this may sound, this is the good news! This web-like dung ball is a necessary fabric, a part of the process. According to the Egyptian model, this is actually the final stage in our goal. By surrounding ourselves with ‘dung’ we have unconsciously done ourselves a favor. We have prepared ourselves for greater life.

With the help of increased access to spiritual information, and understanding of our mythological drama, we can lift the veil obscuring the Light. To ‘split the wood’, we can, wisely, turn to those who made this transition before us for answers.

This was not a bird. It was a teacher; an early savior prototype who emerged from the Central Healing Sun or Atum (or time, as the Egyptians called it) in the form a worm or serpent which was turned into a bird. That this prophet was called a heron is important to note. The Greeks called the Central Healing Sun Tula (Sanskrit for ‘balance’). The Mayans also had profound knowledge of Tula. They called it the ‘place of herons’. 5 Tula is also called ‘the Isle of Fire’. It is the womb from whence the ancients believed all our souls originated. As our soul’s original homeland, it makes sense that a soul-transforming prophet would emerge from the Central Healing Sun.

As noted, Wolfram labeled the Grail as the Phoenix Stone. The stone is also called the Grail. It is the Christ Stone. In Egyptian lore, the heron landed on top of the pyramid (of human civilization), and from its outstretched arms radiated light. It then spewed knowledge (symbolized by the Key of Life), delivering a teaching which would enable Egyptians to transform themselves into herons so that their soul could return to its source.

He is also known as Techu , which meant not only the bird we call an ibis , the symbol of Thoth, but also the instrument that corresponds to the needle of the Balance of Scales or ‘balancers’. The Celts called Tula, the higher dimensions, Avalon – Appleland or Insula Po- Moru (Isle of Apples). The root ava is interchangeable with avi , bird, rendering Avalon as Birdland. Avalon is also known as the mythical kingdom of Camelot, the home of King Arthur, Guinevere, Sir Galahad, the Knights of the Round Table and the Holy Grail. Call it Tula, Avalon, Birdland or Camelot, the meaning is the same. I find it fascinating that there is virtually unanimous agreement among my parent’s generation that Camelot materialized in the early 1960’s during the presidency of John F. Kennedy, whose administration was dreamily referred to by his wife, Jacqueline (“noble in truth”), as ‘Camelot’. Out of this all to brief swirling, romantic era of humanity, we might have expected the heroic Egyptian beetle pushing the dung ball or apple with a worm in it to appear. Incredibly, and quite humorously, it did. The beetle was dressed in the four members of the Beatles, the Fab Four, whose appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 roused the soul of America (transformed by Mrs. Kennedy into Camelot, the center of spirituality on Earth) and rocked our favorite dung ball. “All you need is love,” sang John Lennon and Paul"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 198 McCartney, two cherubic proclaimers of the Word, who may have known more about life than anyone else did at that time. With intensity, ambition, hustle, and hard work the angelic Beatles single-handedly pushed our cocoon into the light of love. The Summer of Love in 1967 represented the apex of the Rock ‘n’ Roll revolution. I know it’s a stretch, but it happened. The beetle of the Egyptian myth reappeared on a massive scale in human consciousness in the form of the Beatles who pushed our dung ball or blue apple into the light of love. Coincidentally, the green apple is the proprietary logo of the Beatles’ record label, Apple Records. Few of us realize that, as far as intellectual property rights -- the l egal domain of the collective human Thought Sphere -- are concerned, the Beatles literally own the idea or meme of the apple. Just try and use it as your corporate logo or affix to anything capable of producing music. A couple of young American computer entrepreneurs who did just that were among the first to discover that no matter when it appears, in antiquarian Egypt or modern America, the beetle(s) means business when it comes to delivering and protecting the apple of higher love. In the late 1970’s 21-year old Zen Buddhism disciple Steve Jobs and computer wizard Steve Wozniak came along to launch the personal computer revolution and to nudge us further into the New Atlantis. “One man. One computer” was Jobs’ revolutionary manifesto. They chose Apple Computer as the name of their company, and the multi-colored apple as their logo.

Jobs and Wozniak were the PC’s first evangelists. If the Internet and World Wide Web which has been spun from their creation is the cornerstone of New Jerusalem spread out on Earth, as has been proclaimed, Jobs and Wozniak are among this realm’s creator gods. Gods or not gods, the Beatles showed just how sensitive and protective of their apple logo they were when they promptly filed a trademark infringement suit against the up- start entrepreneurs. Job’s and Woz’s Apple computer could play music; therefore, it infringed upon the Beatles’ ownership of the symbol of the apple as the source of melodious cosmic emanations which can touch and open the human heart in miraculous ways. To settle the lawsuit, Apple Computer agreed to pay the Beatles a royalty to use the apple name and logo. This is a time of awakening. The match between the ancient Egyptian story of the beetle pushing the dung ball and the contemporary story of the Beatles pushing around Apple Computer offers a constructive story upon which to dive for ancient hidden meanings. Actually, if we dive just a little deeper the story gets even stranger, and an instructive hidden treasure of wisdom sits on the sand below. Steve Jobs originally desired to put a $777.77 price tag"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 200 on the first Apple Computer. Wozniak thought this was too much, so they agreed on $666.66 as the retail price. 666 is the Biblical number for the soul’s enmeshment in the web of Earth and for the Beast of the book of Revelation. Revelation 13:16-18 says: “ Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666 .” The movie The Omen , about the return of the AntiChrist was released the same year as the Apple Computer. The beastly dragon, the AntiChrist, was played by actor Sam Neil who later redeemed himself by playing the good guy paleontologist in the blockbuster movie Jurassic Park in which he ‘slayed the dragon/dinosaur’. This is the exact role assigned to the returning Christ in the book of Revelation. Steve Jobs grew accustomed to patiently explaining to callers that there was no evil connection between the $666.66 selling price and Apple Computer. No, the Devil did not make Steve Jobs do it. In esoteric numerology and lore 666 represents the human soul trapped on Earth. 777 is the number of the next dimensional overtone, and was considered by the ancients to be our soul’s next possible target destination. 777 represents the 7 stars of the Pleiades, the mystical star cluster in the constellation Taurus the Bull to which many ancient temple complexes are aligned, and of which Tiamat was a member. It is important to note that, to the ancients, the Pleiades were perceived as the ‘stargate’ to the Central Healing Sun,"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 201 or Tula, which is given the number 888 (esoterically also the number of Jesus). When humanity transcends 666, said the ancients, we progress to 777, and then on to 888. This explains why, in the Egyptian story, the beetle pushes the light of Tula (love) and carries its prophet, the heron, symbolized by the infinity symbol. The figure 8 is the infinity symbol and ‘signature’ of the heron. It represents the completion of the sacred circuit between the Central Healing Sun, Tula, and Earth with souls coming and going between both locations. (As we can see the figure 8 is two fish, the hieroglyph of the heron joined in a sacred marriage.) The story of the beetle pushing around the apple (or light-absorbing dung ball) is a minor Egyptian curiosity to us sophisticated moderns. With the death of Rock ‘n’ Roll, the Beatles are now relegated to history. Due to the fire- breathing Microsoft Empire, Apple Computer was stripped to its core. As it swung from the tree on the brink of extinction, it was saved when Microsoft came in and rescued it. However, combine these stories with the unstable spirituality, metaphysics, religion, science an d politics of our times and we find the beetle has appeared once again to remind us of a story of epic proportions: the New Age is dawning, the time of the return of the heron is upon us. The crystal halls of Christ’s Court are opening. Incidentally, in 1997 Steve Jobs returned to take temporary control of the dangling Apple Computer Company. One of his first initiatives was the launching of Apple’s new Internet computer the I-Mac. As part of its marketing plan Apple dropped the rainbow colored apple for its logo."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 202 They replaced it with a pretty blue apple. It is no coincidence that as I write this book the Internet, the communications web spread over the planet is blossoming. It is strange, but truly wonderful, how certain archetypes appear to recur throughout history. The Interne t is the Net in its simplest form. It is the cornerstone. It is th e ‘global brain’ of humanity, making all the accumulated knowledge and characteristics of humanity directly accessible twenty-four hours a day. As I write this, Bill Gates has declared the ‘catholization’ of the Internet. By this he means to make the Net universal. Skeptics cry foul, saying he will control the Thought Sphere of Earth (and the gateway to Heaven in the cosmic scheme of things). At the same time we develop the Internet we also develop spacecraft and the theory of wormholes connecting distant parts of our galaxy. This is not a coincidence either . The recent discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope have shown us that we live within a larger ‘Garden’ composed of more than one trillion galaxies similar to our own. The word Hubble is composed of the elements ‘hu’ meaning ‘God’ and ‘bble’ or ‘babel’ meaning ‘gate’. Once we are free of the Sea of Glass we, apparently, are free to move about this infinite Garden. This, I feel, is accomplished by first mastering the lessons of the Sea of Glass and then moving through the crystal halls of Christ’s Court.

They, simply, were too powerful to squeeze into our tiny aquarium."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 203 Jesus, however, is viewed by the Gnostics as one such hyper-compressed soul, man and god simultaneously. In the biblical story he dropped into the cosmic aquarium as an agent of the designer. He made himself smaller to lead the fish into the Cosmic Ocean. He was a walking miracle who carried a spark of the Divine. His mission was to provide knowledge enabling any whom desired to walk the path to communion with God. In much of his teaching the Gnostic thread is present. The Golden Rule of respect for all life and self-determination are two paramount teaching s. Added to this is the idea of salvation through the acquisition of knowledge. As we will explore further now, the Roman Church was severely threatened by the Gnostic Church. The power pack driving the Catholic Church was not the promise of knowledge, but rather, the powerful emotion of guilt. By offering followers confession of sins Catholicism allowed sinners to be fully absolved of sin and to gain admittance into Heaven. No time consuming acquisition of knowledge was necessary. Simply pay a penance and you’re requalified, anytime, anywhere. This marketing scheme was astonishingly attractive and enormously successful. I t brought massive wealth to the Church. It also put the Church in the position of knowing who was doing what to whom, and gave the vicars of Christ control over the minds of the masses. Today, the Internet has assumed this position.

KRIST: SAVIOR OF ATLANTIS One day in the summer of 1931 the citizens of Lavelanet, a tiny town in the Languedoc region of southern France noticed the arrival of a tall, slender man wearing heavy hiking boots. He was headed for the giant ruins of Montsegur, the soaring MC Escher-esque fortress/seminary of the Cathars, the purist Christians who created this islan d in the sky surrounded by a lush emerald forest. The man’s name was Otto Rahn (1904-1939). Though unknown to most this gifted young German author and mythologist may have been one of the most illumined Holy Grail questers in all of history. Prior to his mysterious death, at age 35, he wrote two books about the Cathars and the Holy Grail: Kreuzzug gegen den Gral (“Crusade Against the Grail”) and Luzifers Hofgesinf (“Lucifer’s Court”). These best-selling books were favorites of Adolf Hitler, National-Socialism’s leader, and Heinrich Himmle r, the number two Nazi, who made Rahn’s books mandatory reading by the SS (The Black Order). In this atmosphere of myth and ‘kaos’, Rahn’s Cathar theories soon thrived. He was the man to whom Himmler turned to recover the trophy most coveted by the Nazis: the Holy Grail. While reliable biographical information is scarce, it is"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 206 known that Otto Rahn was born on February 18th, 1904 in Michelstadt in southern Germany. 1 His mother was Jewish, a fact that he tried in vain to conceal from the SS, and which may have figured in his untimely death. In Lucifer’s Court In Europe he recalls that his mother, Clara, introduced him to the Grail romances. As an adult Rahn’s Grail quest was fueled by the medieval Germanic Grail poem Parzival , the literary masterpiece written by the Minnesinger Wolfram von Eschenbach, a Bavarian Knight Templar, between 1195 and 1216 AD, which was revived in the 1800s by Wagner’s popular mystical opera of the same name. From 1922 to 1926 he studied German literature, linguistics and history. 2 He became a medieval scholar whose focus was the Holy Grail. After university Rahn continued his Grail quest, piecing together a series of clues gleaned from a study of the history of the Cathars and the clues of the bard Wolfram. Driven by his deep interest in the Cathars and Grail legends, Rahn researched and traveled widely in France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland in search of myths, legends and the records of the heretical Christian cults, all of whic h he believed would lead him to a pure, Gnostic religion of Europe. During this time he was said to be a frequent guest at the salon of Karl Wiligut (1866-1946), a German mystic and seer recently released from an insane asylum who claimed to have “ancestral memory,” or memory in his blood. His chronology began in 228,000 BC, when there were three suns in the sky and giants and dwarves roamed the Earth! 3"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 207 Wiligut insisted that Christianity, the religion of Krist, was founded in Germany in 12,500 BC as the universal religion. In 9500 BC the Norse god Baldur- Chrestos , a prophet of Krist, escaped crucifixion in Germany and fled to the Middle East where he later became Iesus Christos , or Jesus Christ. 4 As Wiligut was keen to point out, it is an undeniable historical fact that Christianity adopted many pagan cult centers, ceremonies, holidays and myths. By digging underneath Christian sites (and into the meanings of words) one finds the true Atlantean religion, the religion of the technology- wielding angels. Another attentive participant of Wiligut’s rantings was Heinrich Himmler. Wiligut became Himmler’s Rasputin and advisor on mythological subjects. Wiligut’s dates for the founding of the religion of Krist in Germany, 12,500 BC, and Baldur-Chrestos’ escape in 9500 BC roughly coincide with the era ascribed to the ‘sinking’ and ‘resurrection’ of Atlantis. Legends claim Atlantis ‘fell’ or was destroyed by water in c. 10,000 BC. Many feel that Atlantis is purely fable or a metaphor and that the ‘water’ that destroyed it is simply a symbol for a new wisdom that replaced the old. Whether the cataclysmic destruction of Atlantis was physical or psychological (it was probably both), Atlantean researchers have recognized an abrupt change in human culture about l0,000 BC, an era that anthropologists call the Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age).

The Atlantean secret super science the Nazis were"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 208 seeking, which is symbolized by the Grail, belonged to Krist. In 1929 Adolf Hitler proclaimed himself the messiah of a thousand-year ‘Reich’, and promised an alien civilizatio n of genetically engineered Aryan superhumans that would rule the New World. The power behind his throne was Heinrich Himmler who motivated SS members by a belief in a coming utopian society, similar to the Christian New Jerusalem -- a Thousand Years of Peace. Though these concepts are taken from the same pages as Paul’s doctrine of Christ as the New Adam, the superhuman exemplar who comes at the beginning of a New Earth, and the Book of Revelation, the Nazi religion was not based on Christ. It was based on Krist, a mystical belief in Atlantis, and the supremacy of the white skinned, blue eyed, blond-haired Aryan ‘race’ whose secret, super science would bring light to the world. “The Aryan,” wrote Hitler, “is the Prometheus of mankind, from whose shining brow the divine spark of genius has at all times flashed forth, always kindling anew that fire which, in the form of knowledge, illuminated the dark night...” 5 Himmler was out to prove the Aryan ‘race’ was superior to all other races on Earth and that the Germans were the inheritors of the Aryan bloodline. Hitler sought to restore the Aryan ‘race’ to its original purity and greatnes s. Obsessive efforts were made to support this goal with evidence culled from any where the Nazis could get it, from history, folklore, and science. As I stated, this effor t was totally misguided. The Thule Society, a turn-of-the-20 th century German literary society comprised of wealthy and prominent"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 209 Germans, funded the Nazi party and spawned the core Nazi belief in the Aryan homeland of T h u l e . 6 Also called Hyperborea or the “White or Pure Island,” 7 German legend says that the original race of Germans came from an island in the far north that was also home to the race of Atlanteans. Its capital was called Ultima Thule or T u l a 8 (Sanskrit for ‘balance’). The Thule Society was not alone in its belief in Tula. The Greeks and Mayans knew about Tula, as did the Celtic Druids, who called it a mecca for learning. To the Mayans Tula and Atlantis was the same place. They said that they came from a place called Aztlan, Atlan or Tula. The Celts, the Vikings, and the Germanic peoples match this claim: all thought of Thule/Atlantis as the Garden of Eden of the Aryans. In this ‘land beyond the northwind’, the Hyperboreans possessed the secret powers of the world. That is, until the cataclysm of Atlantis. According to the mythological records found from Asia to the Americas, a group of survivors, led by priests and sages, found refuge from the apocalypse of Atlantis in hidden centers around the world. They deposited knowledge in these areas. Thuleans believe some of the survivors became the figures of the Bible, such as Noah , who along with his family rode out the biblical flood in an ark. In fact, in the Hyperborean scheme of things the Bible may be viewed as a record of the children of Atlantis. Some maintain that the Hyperboreans were the race mentioned by Noah’s great-grandfather, Henoch or Enoch. The Shining Ones whose “flesh was as white as snow and red as the rose petal; and the hair on his head and his scalp"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 210 were white as wool; and his eyes were beautiful” matched the Aryan ideal. These Hypberboreans found safety in the Himalayas and finally emerged as Aryans or Indo- Europeans, the blue eyed, blond haired, white skinned ancestors of the Germans. Hitler sought to locate these survivors and their science. One of the prominent voices in the Hyperborean choir was the Russian mystic, Madame Helena P. Blavatsky (1831-1891), arguably the single most influential occulti st of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled are essential, though formidable, reading for all aspiring to learn the forbidden secrets of Atlantis. As she reconstructed history from historical as well as (some consider dubious) psychic research she learned that the first homeland of humanity covered the entire North Pole. The inhabitants had ethereal , not physical bodies. In the Hindu Pur-Anas or books of legend, which are another of Blavatsky’s sources, the Imperishable Island of Hyperborea is called Atala the “White Island,” and has as its mythical center Mount Meru , home of Shambhala. This mountain has four enormous supports. 9 Atala and Tula are interchangeable words. So too are Sabala (Cibola) and Shambhala. In this description of the four supports of Meru, Tula’s center, we are pleasantly reminded of the four-cornered world. This suggests the intriguing possibility that Shambhala and Meru are interchangeable terms for the Sea of Glass, and that this place represents a connecting point to the crystal halls of Christ’s Court. According to Blavatsky, Hyperborea is located at the North Pole, but it is invisible to all but those who possess"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 211 spiritual vision. Mystics envision it as existing in anothe r dimension occupying the same space as our own. 10 Similarly, we have noted, Christian mystics believe the New Jerusalem is a cube located in the ethereal realm ‘above’ Jerusalem, which has as its focal point Mount Moriah or Meru. In Hebrew myth, God found the pure dust from which Adam was formed atop Moriah. 11 The French symbolist, Rene Guenon, was another who sang in the Hyperborean choir. Though he despised Madame Blavatsky’s psychic research techniques, he too claimed humanity was born in the Hyperborean land called Tula (Thule). 12 The dwellers of Tula lived under the primordial law of a spiritual teacher called Manu. After Hyperborea came Atlantis. Most of Guenon’s work concerned symbolism and the erasure of the contrived boundaries separating religions. He concurred with the view that the Grail had an ancient prehistory, being a Christian adaptation of very ancient Celtic/Druid – or Thulean -- tradition. 13 By far the most illustrious of all the voices in the Atlantis/Hyperborean choir was Pal-aton or Plato ( c. 427- 347 BC), the title of a man who, repeating the story of his cousin’s excursion into Egypt, reintroduced the epic story of Atlantis to the collective human imagination. He is the father of ‘Atlantology’. According to Manly P. Hall, 14 Plato, whose real name was Aristocles, was initiated in the mysteries at the age of 49. The initiation took place in the subterranean halls of th e Great Pyramid.

Plato, who is considered one of the world’s greatest scholars, left little room to doubt that he subscribed wholeheartedly to the historicity of Atlantis. Plato said Atlantis was a prosperous, Edenic land of advanced people led by Atlas that disappeared into the waters of the night after a devastating calamity that destroyed their magnificent island. His description of Atlantis came at about the time the Hebrews were in exile in Babylon and were taking history lessons from Sumerian texts that contained the missing pre-history to the Hebrew Book of Genesis. These texts speak of the Sumerian gods E.A. and Ninharsag coming to Earth after An, the name of E.A.’s father, trapped Tiamat in the Net, causing her to split in two and to sink into the waters of the cosmic ocean and to be reborn as Earth."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 213 Taking a cue from Plato, in the late 1800’s former U.S. Congressman Ignatius J. Donnelly prowled the hallowed halls of the Library of Congress answering the siren song of his Atlantean muse. 2,200 years after Plato gave his account of the lost land and introduced Atlantis to the Greek mind; Donnelly took up the mantle as the “Father of Atlantology” in modern America. At the innermost core of all mystery teachings is the belief in a pre-Flood Edenic paradise. Like the early classical scholars, Donnelly associated Timaeus with Genesis and concluded that Atlantis was the original Garden of Eden. (Others assert that the original Motherland of Atlantis was a Pacific island known was Mu , while Meru was known as the Garden of Eden to the Hindus.) In 1882, Donnelly’s Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 15 was published. In chapter one of this tour d’force of Atlantean research, Donnelly presents a cluster of ideas which represent the fruit of his many years of Atlantis research. Twelve thousand years ago, he concluded, there existed a large island (in the Atlantic Ocean) that was known to the ancient world as Atlantis. That’s not all. According to Donnelly: • the description of Atlantis given by Plato is not fable, but history. • Atlantis was the true site of the Garden of Eden and all other earthly paradises, and home to the first human civilization. • The gods and goddesses of the ancient Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Hindus, and the Nordics were the kings, queens and heroes of Atlantis."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 214 • The children of Atlantis were the founders of Egypt, Mexico, America and Peru. • Egyptian and Peruvian religion are remnants of Atlantean sun worship. By Donnelly’s reckoning, no civilization had matched the beauty, elegance, sophistication or spiritual achievements of this island world. He gave the Atlanteans credit for creating the alphabet, medicine and nearly all th e arts and sciences. Despite its advanced science, Atlantis suffered a cataclysmic destruction in which the entire isla nd sank with nearly all its inhabitants. However, a few lucky Atlanteans escaped in ships. These culture bearers spread throughout the world telling the tale of their paradisiacal homeland. By this account humanity had reached a high degree of civilization and then due to a cataclysm lost or ‘forgot’ its glorious past. As frequently happens, what is misunderstood is destroyed or ignored. Despite all the hardships, a segment of the population had retained enough civilization to record what had happened. Priesthoods emerged who preserved these secrets. The secrets these priesthoods possessed were encoded and transmitted in myths such as the Holy Grail, works of art, and songs. These secrets lead humanity onto the golden path to a New Atlantis. As evidenced by their use of stellar symbolism in their religious art the initiates of ancient times knew of the precession of the equinoxes, a time-keeping system which divides a 26,000 year ‘Great Year’ into 12 astrological ‘new ages’ of approximately 2,150 years each.

We are fortunate. The Mayans claim that the Sun will be in direct alignment with the galactic core on December 21, 2012. This date coincides with the conclusion of one 26,000 year Great Year and the commencement of another. Corroboration of the Egyptian knowledge and use of the precession of the equinoxes was deduced by Schwaller de Lubicz from his study of the incredible zodiac from the ceiling of the Temple of Denderah. The Ptolomies constructed this temple in the first century BC upon the site of an ancient temple. 16 The builders claimed it was constructed according to the plan laid down in the time of the ‘companions of Horus’. The reign of the Shemsu-Hor is considered semi-mythical. The Royal Papyrus of Turin (written during the time of Ramses II) records that the reign of the Shemsu-hor stretches to remote antiquity (up to a fantastic 40,000 years). 17 These kings lists call the Shemsu- Hor Akhu , meaning ‘Transfigured Spirits’.

In The Gods of Eden Collins tells of the amazing exploits of these early gods of Egypt who lived during the sep tepi or the First Time. 19 The events surround the ‘Is- land of the Egg’. This Island was referred to as the ‘homeland’. 20 It is here that the first god-ruler called Pn , or “This One,” identified by the priests of Heliopolis (the home of the heron) as Atum, established himself. He founded his throne in a sacred “Field of Reeds”, upon a radiant lotus. He also set up the Djed or Tet Pillars on the Is-land, which were power devices for balancing natural forces in the Earth and the atmosphere. A terrible cataclysm occurred that ended the First Time.

The Is-land vanishes. 23 This sunken Is or Is-land, the sanctum of the creator gods, is spoken of in various forms by many cultures. It is the likely source of the earthly chapter of the story of Atlant-Is.

THE INNER EARTH The Tibetans call the Edenic paradise of humanity “Shambhala, Agarta.” This is equated with the Buddhist paradise atop Mount Meru in Mongolia. Mongolian myth says Shambhala is connected to a grid of interconnected sacred sites. Tunnels or holes in the Earth provide access to these nodal points. If one knew the locations of these ‘holes’ it would be possible to travel the Inner Earth undetected by those on the surface. Strange beliefs about inner worlds gained currency among the Nazis. Hitler and Himmler both, we are told, were deeply interested in tales of the Inner Earth.

It allowed them to fly on artificial wings, to heal and preserve, to protect their cities, and to blast away rocks for the creation of settlements. Its destructive power is so awesome that war had been outlawed. The existence of this forgotten world was reported by another person of high repute, the ‘all American hero’ Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, the first man to fly over the poles in 1926. He was decorated with a gold medal by the Royal Geographical Society in 1931 for his polar explorations. During a flight to the South Pole in 1947, his aircraft hit turbulence and the compass went haywire, making navigation impossible. With the gyroscope still oscillating Admiral Byrd noticed the peaks of a mountain range and a green valley with a river, that just shouldn’t have been there. He decreased his altitude for a closer look and spotted a mammoth grazing! The engine faltered and the Admiral made an emergency landing. He saw some habitations and made a hasty last entry in his log, “I do not know what is going to happen now... “ What did happen was that upon his return he was debriefed by his superiors and prevented from disclosing the facts in the public domain! He claimed to have seen a ‘glowing city which appeared to be made of crystal’.

On April 18, 1945, F.D.R. endorsed a risky raid on Tokyo that paid off in an enormous psychological victory for the sagging American spirits. The Japanese command had vowed to the people of Japan that their homeland would never be invaded. Not even the Chinese had been able to invade Japan. When the worldwide airwaves rippled with the news of the bombing people throughout the world wanted to know where the planes had come from. Roosevelt beamed, “They came from a secret base in Shangri-La,” he said. 27 Was F.D.R. joking? Or, was he telling those ‘in the know’ exactly what was happening? Did these planes literally appear from within an Inner Earth portal in Shambhala? F.D.R. also named the presidential hideaway in Maryland Shangri-la . Historians claim this was a reference to James Hilton’s famous 1933 book The Lost Horizon . This fictional work is the tale of a group of people who become stranded in Shangri-La, a peaceful Tibetan mountain refuge that is home to the immortals.

Among the numerous Grail coincidences or intentions upon the part of the United States government during the Manhattan Project, one of the most fascinating involves the selection of Oak Ridge, Tennessee as the site for the first nuclear reactor. Historians say that Brigadier General Leslie R.Groves, the commander of the Manhattan Project, selected this area because he liked the isolation the geolog y of East Tennessee offered. Cherokee myth, on the other hand, says that East Tennessee was believed to be a garden of creation similar to the Garden of Eden found in the book of Genesis. The Cherokee oral tradition related by Dhyani Ywahoo, a twenty-seventh generation Cherokee, tells a story whose elements are by now familiar to us. 29 It tells how the first Cherokee came from the star system known as the Pleiades (which the Egyptians called “ the Khem ” and the Greeks called “ the Atlantides ”). The first spark of individuated mind came from there as well. From the void came a Creator Being who first appeared as a universal tone that was also a light. The first beings to emerge from this light were called tla (which stands for Tula) beings or “thought beings.” 30 Star Woman fell to Earth, opening the way for the star beings to appear. There were twelve tribes in all, each coalescing along twelve vortices or holes in the Earth. These original twelve tribes were called the Tsalagi Nation. Each nation handled a particular vortex and a particular responsibility. 31 Cherokee mythology related by James Mooney tells of a great snake called Uktena who was “...as large around as"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 222 a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright blazing crest like a diamond upon its forehead, and scales glitterin g like sparks of fire.” 32 This diamond in his forehead was described as a large transparent crystal that contained enormous spiritual power that could work miracles. The Cherokee claim that Uktena’s crystals were actual artifacts that preserved sacred knowledge. In fact, Cherok ee religion appears to be structured around their knowledge of Quartz crystal. Each of the twelve original tribes of the Cherokee Nation exemplified a particular aspect of Cherokee life. The first were the crystal takers. The peacemakers and healers, sacred geometers, smiths and masons, scientists, gardeners, life force makers, ambassadors, and worldshapers followed these. Of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth lines the Cherokee do not speak. It is beyond words, says Ms. Ywahoo. 33 It seems beyond coincidence to me that the mythology of the Cherokee so closely matches that of Plato’s Atlantis myth. One can only wonder if General Groves knew of these legends and that this was the reason for locating the Manhattan (or Man-Aton) Project there.

THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF THE CATHARS At the urging of university professor Hermann Wirth Heinrich Himmler established the Ahnenerbe Society, or the German Heritage Society. This research group pursued all avenues of antiquities research: archaeological, architectural, historical, cultural, religious, linguis tic and the occult. It was fully controlled by the SS. (The Ahnenerbe Society’s voluminous files are now in the National Archives of the United States government.) With the help of his SS historians Himmler hoped to recover the advanced pre-Flood (Atlantean) religion and super science. This Aryan religion, Himmler hoped, would destroy Christianity. In pursuit of these secrets Himmler dispatched teams of Ahnenerbe researchers in search of the ancient secrets of German antiquity. Nazi digging grounds included Tibet (1939), the Near East (1938) and Antarctica (1938 and 1945). All the missions shared the same purpose: the discovery of the secrets of Atlantis, and simultaneously, the origins and forbidden secrets of the Aryans.

Templars wearing white surcoats with red crosses guarded it. Parzival was a favorite work of Otto Rahn. 2 He pointed out that this locale’s description rang of Montsegur. Mythological and linguistic links led Otto Rahn to Montsegur and the Cathars as keepers of the ancient German (Atlantean) religious tradition that had been ruthlessly and violently suppressed by the Church. In 1931 Rahn was in the process of confirming his intuition and verifying the accuracy of an incredible hypothesis: Montsegur was indeed the Montsalvat, or Mount of Salvation, of Grail legend. This casket-shaped fortress held somewhere within it the Holy Grail. Rahn intended to retrieve the Grail and return it to Germany. Identifying Wolfram’s Parzival, as a Cathar Rahn believed that he could triumph where centuries of Grail questing had failed. All that he needed to do was match Eschenbach’s Grail locations to actual landmarks in Cathar country. Soon after his arrival in the Languedoc Rahn met Antonin Gadal, a well-known French Grail researcher. 3 Gadal, called the “Cathar pope,” maintained a private Cathar museum in the town of Ussat-les-Bains, a spa town in the Pyrenees rich in Cathar tradition. He enthusiastical ly received the young German Grail quester. Gadal was a member of a French society called The Friends of Montsegur and the Grail . This society promoted the connection between the Cathars and the Grail"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 225 Romances. The French author Josephin Peladan in L e Secret des Troubadours had first made this link in 1906. 4 Staying at a nearby guest house afforded Rahn the opportunity to delve deeply into Cathar history. Rahn took a lease on the Hotel Marroniers in May of 1932 and became an innkeeper to support his researches. In many meetings with the local people (he is said to have spoken the local Provencal language fluently) he gathered everything he could relating to the Cathars and the Grail. According to Hans Jurgen-Lange, Rahn was visited at the Hotel Marroniers by the German singer and actress Marlene Dietrich and her friend Josephine Baker, the black jazz singer. 5 Both of these women were alarmed at the nightmarish society the Nazis were rapidly creating. Dietrich feared the demise of her beloved France. Both Dietrich and Baker received the Legion d’Honneur, Croix de Guerre, and the Resistance Medal in honor of their fierce anti-Nazi efforts. What, we wonder, did they want with a German mythologist? Romance? Song or movie ideas? Cathar secrets? French researchers have concluded that subterranean tunnels adjoin Montsegur, which Rahn considered was the Mount of Salvation, the hallowed mountain of Grail lore. Over a period of three months he systematically explored the ruined Cathar temple-fortress as well as the surroundin g mountain grottoes. Legends in Spain say the secrets of the Holy Grail, and also the books of the Cathars, were hidden in the ‘magic cave of Hercules’. In the largest cavern of the Sabarthez, near Montsegur, there is a hall in which a stalagmite called ‘the tomb of Hercules’ can be found. 6"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 226 Deep within the grottoes of the Sabarthez Rahn found chambers in which the crystal halls were covered with symbols characteristic of the Knights Templar, side by side with the sacred emblems of the Cathars. This finding confirmed the notion fostered and nurtured by mystical historians, that the Knights Templar and the Cathars were at one time closely associated. These connections formed the basis of Rahn’s thrilling accounts of his exploration of the caverns of Sabarthez south of Montsegur and especially the Lombrives caverns called “the Cathedral” by the local people. In Crusade Against the Grail he described this magnificent cavern as follows: “In time out of mind, in an epoch whose remoteness has been barely touched by modern historical science, it was use d as a temple consecrated to the Iberian God Illhomber, God of the Sun. Between two monoliths one which had crumbled, the steep path leads into the giant vestibule of the cathedral of Lombr ives. Between the stalagmites of white limestone, between walls o f a deep brown color and the brilliant rock crystal, the path lea ds down into the bowels of the mountain. A hall 260 feet in height served as a cathedral for the heretics .” 7 Rahn tells how, “Deeply stirred I walked through the crystal halls and marble crypts. My hands put aside the bones of fallen pure ones and knights...” (Emphasis mine.) In another nearby cave, that of Fontanet, there is a pure white stalagmite called “the altar”. A poem of Grail writer Wolfram Von Eshcenbach, refers to the same two stalagmites."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 227 “Hercules, then the Greek Alexander, for they are all familiar with the stones... There stood, also, according to the custom of the time, the altar. Exposed thereon was this jewelcase”. Rahn believed he had found the crystal halls of the Cathars and the hiding place of the Grail. He returned to Germany to spread the news. Upon his return to Germany, Rahn reunited with Karl Wiligut and was working on Lucifer’s Court . Crusade Against the Grail did not yet have Nazi endorsement. His book sales were insufficient to support him. Rahn was nearly starving. He did, however, have a fan in Heinrich Himmler. He was in no position to turn down the former chicken farmer and Munich police man turned Nazi Reichsfurer when he came calling and offering the young Grail quester a job. On February 29, 1936, an SS Divisional General, Karl Wolff, wrote to the SS recruitment office to convey Himmler’s personal wish that Rahn be admitted into the SS. 8 Rahn’s Jewish heritage apparently had not been uncovered. Normally SS recruits were required to prove their racial purity back to 1750. On March 12, 1936 Rahn officially joined the inner core of Himmler’s staff. While Rahn worked for the Nazis it is debatable whether or not he wore the black SS uniform with pride or prejudice. Friends describe a starving Rahn donning the menacing-looking black uniform with its gleaming silver SS runes for survival reasons. Others say he enjoyed the perceived power of the dreaded costume."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 228 As a Nazi Rahn was now free to roam Himmler’s massive occult library at Wewelsburg and to enjoy wide acclaim. He also had an open checkbook to pursue his theories. A Grail knight with unlimited funds can accomplish much. After his induction Rahn was immediately sent to Iceland to search for evidence that the island was once part of Hyperborea, one of many such Ahnenerbe missions to follow. Himmler was unsatisfied with the Aryan evidence his scholarly ‘new Atlanteans’ were providing. He ordered Rahn to complete his second book by October 31, 1936 – the pagan festival of Samhain or Halloween – and provide it to the Nazi editors for approval. Lucifer’s Court In Europe , sometimes translated as Lucifer’s Servants , was published in 1936. This book was a sequel to Crusade Against the Grail . It continued his theme that the Cathar’s enemy, the Church, was Lucifer’s servant. Lucifer’s Court is a Nazi propaganda tract. How much of it was Rahn’s beliefs and how much of it came from SS high command is unknown. Rahn presents Lucifer as a benign “light-bringer” and “God of Love” as illustrated by the following paragraphs translated by Peter Levenda in his book Unholy Alliance : It was necessary, in effect, to be faithful to God until death , “and God will give to his servant the crown of eternal life,” a s it is written in the Bible.

And if we follow this thought to its logical conclusion, we will say that, for them, the God of Love was none other than Lucifer in person . This hypothesis will become certain if we allow our thought to range more widely: the god Amor is the god of Spring, as is Apollon... Apollon brought back the light of the Sun: he is a light-bearer, or “Lucifer.” According to the Apocalypse of John, Apollyo-Apollon was equated with the Devil, and according t o the belief of the Roman Church... Lucifer is Satan. Consequently, the god of Spring Apollon-Amor is, according to the doctrine of the Church, the Devil and Satan .” 9 Rahn’s bottom line was that the Cathars were Satan or Lucifer worshippers. However, the Church had changed the meaning of the word Lucifer and so performed a secret changing of the gods! By labeling Lucifer as demonic, the Church prevented the masses from seeking the secrets of Light and the (S)tones of God. The Cathars were great preachers, and made no secret of their beliefs. Their doctors and great orators claimed their doctrine was based on common sense and attacked the ‘mysteries’ of the Catholic Church, which they charged with being mere superstition and magic. 10 As Gnostics, the Cathars believed salvation is achieved through knowledge. The keystone tenet of the Catharic doctrine was the assertion that the material world, i.e. the Sea of Glass, was not created by God. 11 It was the work of Satan. Man too was the creation of the Devil (otherwise"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 230 Lucifer) who lured down from Heaven a great group of souls who had been created by God and were living close to him, in a state of beatitude. These angelic souls were trapped in a cosmic aquarium and imprisoned in a fleshy body, entirely removed from God. The Devil was none other than the God of the Old Testament. The only way out was to successively reincarnate in a body better suited for his spiritual purification. God dispatched Jesus, the most perfect of his angels, as a Mediator to re-establish contact between Heaven and the fallen souls. He did not incarnate in fleshy form in the impure world of Earth, rather he appeared as a Holy Spirit, an image or a phantom. In this way he could never die. But the Devil, having recognized the appearance of the Messenger of God sought to make him fallible. His enemies were told to hold it as an article of faith that Jesus had really suffered terribly (remember the ‘Y’) and died on the Cross. In reality, he could not die. When Jesus had completed showing his disciples the means to return to Heaven he left behind on Earth a Church impregnated with that Holy Spirit which alone could offer the true Way home for the souls dwelling in exile. But the Devil, said the Cathars, was extremely cunning, showing great skill in keeping humanity ‘in the dark’. He destroyed Jesus’ teachings in the most underhanded and diabolical manner, by substituting a false Church for the true one. This false Church assumed the title of ‘Christian’ , but it was in fact the Church of the Devil, and taught doctrines diametrically opposed to those of Jesus. The pure teaching of Jesus, the real Church of the Holy Spirit, was that of the Cathars. They claimed to be the only"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 231 persons who had kept and preserved the Holy Spirit that Christ had bestowed upon His Church. As the Inquisition demonstrated, the Cathars possessed ancient documents, which were directly inspired by Jesus, to back up their claim. According to Catharic belief, one object of Earth life was to make over the human body as a worthy vehicle for the light of the Holy Spirit. The point was to know Christ not as a savior but as an exemplar, a target, which by his Crucifixion “opened the cube” and brought the holy fire of the Spirit of Heaven to Earth. When the Roman Christian church began to consolidate its power in the fourth century it assimilated the pantheon of ancient gods and goddesses (Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, Persian, Asian) into a composite Devil. All nations outside of Rome were considered Devil worshippers. Lucifer became the catchall term for the Devil. The idea of personified evil ruling the world and called Satan, Lucifer , or the Devil remains deeply rooted in the Christian mind. The Cathars were not the last to discover the Church’s ‘changing of the gods’ or to experience Roma’s bloodthirsty campaign to control the world. As Rahn tells it in Lucifer’s Court in 1519 the Aztecs of Mexico shared a similar fate as the Cathars and held blood memory of Tula. As Rahn wrote: In the wake of Columbus... the sails of Ferdinand Cortez crossed the seas. It was he who conquered the kingdom of the Aztecs and Mexico for the benefit of Spain. In an account that he sent to the imperial court one reads that the king of the Aztec s had bowed to the Emperor because he held (the Emperor) to be"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 232 the same Lord of luminous beings and superior essence “from which had issued his own ancestors.” Montezuma had also been about to permit Cortez to appropriate all the idols... that is u ntil he, the king – imprisoned by the gold-hungry conquerors and mortally wounded by them – understood who they really were. He refused to allow them to treat his wounds and, energetical ly resisting the idea of converting to Christianity, wished fo r nothing more than death. And he did die, the victim of a fright ful mistake. Cortez was the envoy of the Pope and the Catholic emperor and not at all of the “ White God ” for whom (the king) and his people had been waiting so long . This White God was to have come from the ancient land of Tulla or Tullan (which, according to their beliefs, had once been “a country of the su n” but “where now ice reigned” and where “the sun had disappeared) – that is to say: from Thule . Rather than the servants of Lucifer, those whom they had greeted ... were the representatives of that “ilk” which, shamelessly, dishono rs the face of our mother the Earth with its filth and its horrors.” (Emphasis mine.) 12 Rahn made it perfectly clear that he believed the shameless “ilk” was the Catholic Church. Quetzalcoatl (‘the plumed serpent’) was the name of the White God whom the Aztecs were awaiting. He was called the King of Tula and the King of Peace. In Peru he was called Viracocha. The King of Peace is exactly the title held by an immensely important biblical figure, Lord Melchizedek, the founder of a priesthood of which Jesus was a member, whom we will investigate momentarily. Rahn’s statement leaves no room to doubt that the White God, Lucifer, visited the Aztecs and Mayans."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 233 Quetzalcoatl, the King of Tula, was depicted as a bearded white man.

Located in the Holy of Holies of Wewelsburg was a black marble stone struck with the two SS runes in silver, the altar of the Black Order, allegedly waiting for the Grail. All that he needed to complete the puzzle was the Grail itself. For this he would soon dispatch Otto Rahn to the Languedoc to retrieve it to bring it back to Germany. At this time, Himmler apparently still did not know his favorite researcher was half Jewish. After his trip in 1937, Rahn went back to Germany and never returned to the Languedoc, although a 1939 trip was purportedly planned. What he learned in 1937 is unknown. From this moment forward Himmler’s once rising star began his meteoric crash to Earth. Rahn’s descent began soon after he returned from the Languedoc. By then Rahn had been a member of the SS for about 13 months. During this time he rose from private to 2 nd Lieutenant, though he performed no military duty. He was assigned to four months of guard duty, a mandatory SS obligation, at Dachau concentration camp, near Munich. 13 Rahn must have been profoundly affected by the horrors he saw at Dachau.

The title of the book was The Testament of Prometheus: A Journey to Hell and Beyond . It was a novel that Rahn considered his singular intellectual achievemen t. Gnostic Christians maintained that the “light” Lucifer brought was true enlightenment, which he gave humanity against God’s will, as Prometheus stole the fire (stone) of heaven to bring civilization to mankind against the will of Zeus. Himmler not only granted the leave of absence but also promoted Rahn to the rank of 1 st Lieutenant on September 11, 1938. While it is thought that Rahn did not recover the Grail, it is believed he knew where it was located and planned to retrieve it in 1939. Unquestionably, Himmler watched him like a hawk. This is when Rahn’s relationship with the Nazis drastically changed. In 1938, while Hitler was completing his military build-up in preparation for Nazi-fying the world, Rahn suddenly proposed that instead of making war on the world Germany should use the knowledge he gained among the Cathars to transform Germany and Europe into a community of “Pure Ones” or Cathars. He also thought the Nazis should convert to Catharism. He further proposed gathering the nations of Europe together as one to serve world Peace.

On February 28, 1939 Rahn wrote a letter to Karl Wolff asking for an immediate discharge from the SS. He cited “extremely grave circumstances” as the justification for h is request. No one knows for certain what these circumstances were. Did the Nazis finally uncover his Jewish ancestry? Or, did these ‘circumstances’ have to do with his research in the Languedoc? Did this walking encyclopedia of Grail knowledge fear for his life because of what he knew? Rahn’s request for discharge was granted. On March 13, 1939 he disappeared under mysterious circumstances. There are several accounts given. He was reportedly killed in an alpine skiing accident. However, no body was ever found. 14 One obituary notice announcing his death did not appear until May 25. A second appeared one week later in an SS newspaper. Karl Wolff signed both obituaries. The day after receiving Rahn’s letter of resignation, Wolff wrote to the SS office of Racial Questions, notifying them that SS 1 st Lieutenant Otto Rahn was unable to prove Aryan ancestry going back to 1750. On July 17 Rahn’s father wrote to a group of German newspaper writers that his son had died in a snowstorm at Ruffheim, on March 13, 1939 – a full four days before his dismissal by the Nazis. Historians find trouble with this claim. Rahn was a seasoned traveler who knew his way around his beloved forests and mountains. As an SS officer he was trained in survival skills.

Before doing so, however, we may be assured that they would have beaten him to death to retrieve any remaining Grail secrets he possessed. Faced with a choice of spitting out his Grail secrets to the Nazi thugs along with his teeth and blood or suicide he chose the hero’s way out. Or did he? Like other high-ranking SS officers including Rudolph Hess and even Hitler, the question of Rahn’s survival is one that has occupied the minds of European researchers since the War. There is an intriguing theory that Rahn underwent plastic surgery and was reborn, phoenix-like, as Rudolph Rahn. The new Rahn was appointed to the diplomatic service and sent to Iraq as an ambassador. Later, he was appointed the German Ambassador to Italy in 1943. In 1945 his old friend and co-conspirator, Karl Wolff, agreed to the German surrender to the Allies in Italy in 1945. 16 He died in 1975. The ultimate knowledge Otto Rahn uncovered in the crystal halls of the Cathar’s cathedral will forever remain unknown. Unless, and until, the United States government opens and releases his files held in the National Archives. He did, however, leave substantial clues to its nature and origins. These clues, of course, focus on the Cathars and their Gnostic beliefs. One thing is certain, these beliefs stand in stark contrast to the Church of Roma or Rome.

THE SONS OF LIGHT The Church of Rome is founded upon the beliefs of the Apostle Paul. As told in the book of Acts (a romance), one day Paul had a mystical experience on the road to Damascus (actually the Essene monastery at Qumran) during which he was knocked from his horse by a ‘light from Heaven’. 1 He interpreted this as a visitation from Jesus, whom he never knew personally. The event left him temporarily blind. 2 After being healed by a Nazorean follower of Jesus several days later he enthusiastically (some say fanatically) began promoting a teaching about Jesus. He proclaimed Jesus the Healing Son of God and decided that He offered himself as a blood sacrifice on the cross (+) to a tone for the sins of Adam and of all (the whole, 360, O) who would believe in Him. He would return one day to judge us. In one of the most amazing ironies of history Paul’s version of the story of Jesus became the basis for the Roman Christian religion, the exact regime Jesus despised the most.

No other knowledge, artifact or spiritual preparation is necessary. However, there is another side to this story. Jesus’ family, and other members of the Essene Mother Church who regarded him as a mortal prophet, were aghast at Paul’s portrayal of Jesus as God. 3 Paul personally, as well as his teachings, were largely rejected by those closest to Jesus who flatly denied that he was a disciple. 4 In fact, they considered Paul a liar and a heretic. A serious, and in my opinion, dangerous, misconception held by many Christians is that the disciples of Jesus were simple fisherman and laborers, and that they were all men. In fact, they were highly trained initiates who, under the guidance of the Essene teacher John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, had carefully prepared himself or herself to receive the teachings of Christ. The Essenes priesthood was resident in Judea and Egypt. One of their alternate names , Nazori , means ‘to keep, to protect’. They looked upon themselves as preservers of the “ light of Truth .” In the V i s i o n s , Commands, and Similitudes of Hermas – one of the apocryphal New Testament texts that was discarded by the early Church Fathers, but which was previously accepted by the original Christians and may have been a genuine Essene text – we find a hint of the knowledge taught by John the Baptist to the Essenes. 5 In it a mystical shepherd is introduced who teaches that the Son of God is the Law of God.

The Law of John had come from Egypt. Specifically, from the goddess Maat, the Egyptian goddess of “Truth” or “Justice,” and the original name of the Aryan word for “mother.” Maat’s symbol was a feather against which she weighed each man’s heart-soul (ab). Presided over by the ibis-headed birdman Thoth, the ‘weighing of the heart ceremony’ tested the soul’s progress. In the weighing of the heart ceremony depicted on the next page we notice that the human heart is on the right arm of the balance. A vase symbolizes it.

The Essenes had considerable medical skill. They were called physicians of the soul, and professed mastery of the secrets of miraculous healing, particularly diseases of th e mind. The Greek name by which they were known, T h e r a p e u t a e (Essene is the Assyrian word for Therapeutae), signifies healer , or doctor . Essene comes from the Greek Essenoi, a name which some translate as ‘Pious Ones’. This appellation links them to the Cathars or Pure Ones. Epiphanius, a Christian bishop and writer of the fourth century, in speaking of the Essenes, says: “They who believed on Christ were called Jessaei (or Essenes) before they were called Christians. They derived"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 243 their constitution from the signification of the name ‘Jesu s’, which in Hebrew signifies the same as Therapeutaes, that is, a savior or physician.” 7 This statement indicates that, like ‘Enoch’, ‘John’, and ‘Joshua’, the name ‘Jesus Christ’ was an initiatory title he ld by groups of individuals. Recent studies by Dead Sea Scroll scholars of the available Essene texts indicate that the Essenes were great weavers of ancient religious traditions. They called themselves the “ sons of Light ” and looked upon themselves as preservers of the “ light of Truth .” Three religious traditions in particular, the Aryan, the Egyptian and the Jewish are the primary source traditions from which the Essenes wove their beliefs, and especially, their medical skill. We will briefly consider each of these three here. The Jewish historian Josephus said the Essenes drew their knowledge from sacred books that they had inherited. He writes: “They display an extraordinary interest in the writings of the ancients, singling out in particular those which make for the welfare of soul and body. With the help of these, and with a view to the treatment of diseases, they make investigations into medicinal roots and the properties of stones ”. 8 The Essenes traced their medical skill to Shem the son of Noah, who handed sacred books down to Jacob (Abraham’s grandson) and the priestly tribe of Levi, one of Jacob’s twelve sons. One such book was entitled Sefer Asaf or Sefer Refu’ot , the Book of Medicines . This book, which Scroll scholars believe may have been Essene in origin, is attributed to a medical historian named Asaph. 9 The Book of Medicines laid under tribute “the books of the wise men"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 244 of India,” connecting the Essenes with the Buddhas and the Aryans. Though they were Jews their teachings were Aryan (and by extension Atlantean) in origin. It is asserted that shortly after the time of Alexander the Great (330 BCE), the missionaries of Buddha made their appearance at Alexandria, Egypt. These missionaries brought Indian (Aryan) religious and medical texts to Egypt, Palestine and Greece and organized mystical societies under various names including the Essenes. Thus the Aryan (“Noble” or “high”) Buddhists prepared the way for the birth of Christianity. Asaph, the compiler of Aryan medical texts, became a healing saint in the Christian calendar. The romance of Barlaam and Joasaph was a favorite of the Cathars. 10 This is enough to arouse our interest in him, however, there is much more intrigue around this Asaph. In India he is called Yuz-Asaf, and is identified as Jesus. It is held in India that Jesus survived the Crucifixion and traveled to India to teach the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, the sons of Jacob, who had settled in Kashmir. A second strand woven by the Essenes is of the Persian or Aryan religion of Zarathustra ( c. 600 BC), brought back to Jerusalem by the Jews who returned from the Babylonian exile. 11 Zarathustra or Zoroaster (“star of gold” or “splendor of the Sun”) is the savior to the Aryans of Central Asia. He is equated with the Sumerian E.A. The fabulous bas-relief depicted opposite is of Zarathustra (E.A.). The Aryans of ancient Iran were followers of the teachings of Zoroaster or Zarathustra.

The Persians believed God and the devil were twin brothers, born simultaneously from the womb (or the ‘Pit’) of the mother goddess. The heavenly god remained in the ethereal realm while his brother came to Earth to create the material world. Both spirits came from the same Source: Ahura Mazda, the Supreme God of light of Iran. In the Cathar scheme one of these gods was the good guy, AMOR , the god of love, or the King of Love. This god comes from an ethereal realm. A clue as to where this ethereal realm is located may be given in the definition of the French word for love amour , which also means ‘fire or light of the Sun’. The second god was ROMA (the mirror image of AMOR ), another name for the evil King of the World Rex Mundi . According to the Cathars, this is the Catholic Church. As I discussed in The Healing Sun Code , these spirits are symbolized by two serpents ~~, and their Source, the Central Healing Sun, is symbolized by an egg. Zoroaster taught three principles that are the heart of his religion: purification of the soul and body through prayer and fire worship, tilling the soil, and fighting Ahriman, the dark god. Zoroaster also taught that each soul has a right to freedom of moral choice while incarnate on Earth, a choice of love or fear, good and evil, light and darkness.

Their services were no longer required. In addition to self-rule o n Earth, Zoroaster promised life after death to all, declarin g that resurrection would be preceded by the arrival of a Savior figure at the end of time when the forces of good wins out over the forces of evil. These teachings and prophecies created divisions among the Jewish tribes. Later, the Cathars and other sects who upheld the Grail heresy adopted these beliefs creating division within the Christian church. In fact, the Cathars possessed a direct Aryan and Central Asian connection. The Cathars followed the Gnostic doctrines of Manicheaism , the dualistic religion of a prophet named M a n i who revived the teachings of Zoroaster. Mani, “the apostle of light,” was born in Babylonia c. 216 AD to a Virgin Goddess named Mar Miriam or Sancta Maria. He visited India and China, and won royal status in Iran. At the age of twenty-four Mani had a spiritual awakening. Breaking with the Mandaean religion he claimed to be the spiritual heir to Buddha, Zoroaster and Jesus. Here, we are reminded that in Eastern tradition found in India and Tibet, the cubic stone is known as a jewel of perfect proportions that is seen as a clear crystal or diamond known as the Mani stone. It is the source of the Hindu philosopher’s stone, the source of the elixir Soma that bestows spiritual vision and immortality.

He also calls them informally al- Mughasilah “the Baptists” or “ones who wash themselves”. There is no doubt that these people are the Mandaeans. ‘Ibn al-Nadim ties Mani the founder of Manichaeism to them. He writes that Mani’s father, Futtaq, belonged to the al-Mughasilah before the birth of Mani. 13 In addition to the Buddhist and Aryan strands, there is also evidence that another of the strands woven by the Essenes is Egyptian in origin. After the capture of Solomon’s Temple in 576 BC, most of the Jews were deported to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, but several thousand captive Jews were taken to the northern Nile delta region of Egypt. 14 Contact between Jews dispersed to Egypt and those remaining in Israel or returning to Israel from Babylon is known to have taken place after 550 BC. The Indian name Yuz-Asaf was held in reverence by the Essenes as the same as Joseph, or Jos-aph , the favorite son of Jacob who was placed in a ‘pit’ and achieved wisdom. No mere hole in the ground, this ‘pit’ is the ‘underground’ Hall of Judgment of Maat. This ‘Pit’ is the same as the Abaton, the transformative womb of the goddess mentioned in Revelation 20:12. “The biblical writer of Isaiah told Lucifer: “Thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the Pit’. 15 The Pit is Earth. The medieval poet Dante’s journey through Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise is another of the most lucid examples of the crossing we are describing.

They enter a dark tunnel and emerge (“through a round opening seeing again the stars”) onto the island-mountain of Purgatory. He soars through nine heavenly spheres, each sphere larger than the last, until he reaches the Primum mobile, the ninth and largest sphere and boundary of space. Dante hopes to see the Empyrean home of God, which finally appears to him as a blinding point of light surrounded by nine concentric spheres that represent angelic orders. “Lucifer” is the Latin term originally used by the Romans to refer to the planet Venus (home of the Saba) when that planet was west of the Sun and hence rose before the Sun in the morning, thereby being the morning star. The word appears to have entered the religious lexicon when the original Hebrew word “heyleyl” (meaning morning star, or literally, “ shining one ”) was translated to “Phosphorus” (the Greek word for Venus as the morning star) in the Septuagint, and then translated into “Lucifer” in the Vulgate (from the Greek Septuagint). 16 Lucifer is Latin for light-bringing . It comes from lux , lucis , light, and ferre , to bear. Webster’s Dictionary defines Lucifer as Satan, the leader of the revolt of the angels before his fall. 17 Lucifer was originally a magnificent angel, a courier of God, a prime noble (Aryan) in the halls of Heaven. His name is the Latin title for the Morning Star god. He was called Ra in Egypt. The Canaanites called him Shaher. He had a twin brother, Shalem (‘Peace’), the Evening Star. 18 Shalem or Salem was a title later given to Jesus. At the time this myth was recorded, the seventh century BC, the Canaanites were"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 250 living in Jerusalem, which means “House of Shalem.” Both Shalem and Shaher were born of the Great Mother Asherah in her world-womb known as Helel, or “the Pit.” 19 In myth, twins usually represent the two sides of human nature: light and dark, male and female, war and peace, solar and lunar. Shaher coveted the superior glory of his twin and sought to usurp his throne, but was defeated and cast down from Heaven like a lightning bolt. Two hundred years before Christ a Hebrew scribe copied the Canaanite story almost verbatim, and ascribed its words to the prophet Isaiah. The rest, as they say, is history. For millions of Christians Satan and Hell are historical facts. Little do they realize their origins. A comparison between the Canaanite version and that of Isaiah is most illuminating in the way it shows the overt editorial tampering so rampant in the Bible. The original Canaanite version is in italics: How hast thou fallen from heaven, Helel’s son Shaher! How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, Son of the morning! Thou didst say in thy heart, I will ascend to Heaven. For thou has said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, Above the circumpolar stars will I raise my throne I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, And I will dwell on the Mount of Council in the back of the North I will sit also upon the mount of the Congregation ( Saba ),"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 251 In the sides of the north: I will mount on the back of a cloud I will be like unto Elyon. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High .” Isaiah (14:12-14) Interestingly, Isaiah was compiled at exactly the same time that the Essene Therapeutae were compiling sacred texts and “light teachings” in Egypt. Cross-checking Egyptian tradition for the meaning of the word Abaton we learn that: • Ab is the Egyptian word for heart-soul, and • Ab is also the Latin version of apo , and the English of , and denotes from, away or down from. • Aton or Aten is the name of the Central Healing Sun, symbolized by a disk of light with rays extending from it. This was also the name of the religion introduced by Akhenaton. As noted, his religion was one of the forerunners of the Essene religion. It was a religion of Light, i.e. Lucifer. These definitions render the Pit of Abaton as “Heart- soul of Aton or Aten.” Factor in the fact that apo is the root for hope: a changed or enlightened heart and a clear picture of the purpose of this Pit (Earth) emerges: it is a womb of transformation. In Judeo-Christian terminology Abaton is a synonym for Hell, a place to be avoided at all costs. Originally, however, Hel was the goddess’ fiery furnace or womb of transformation; a place where men were transformed into gods. 20 Significantly, the meaning of the Egyptian word ab ,"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 252 heart-soul, was also reversed in Hebrew; ab was redefined as “father.” The feminine teachings relative to the heart- soul were suppressed. They were not, however, completely erased. In essence, Lucifer chose the female goddess and her powerful “light teachings” over the male God. He also sought her sexual pleasures, a fact that explains why the sexually frustrated Church fathers called Lucifer’s sin hubris , which originally referred to a penile erection. 21 It is easy to see why Lucifer was given such a bad rap by the Church. He sought to be the spouse of the Goddess, to stand at the core of the Heavens (carried there on a cloud), and to become a God, “I will be like the Most High.” He would do this by undergoing a powerful transformation in the Pit of the Goddess, her sacred cave of rebirth and resurrection. In summary, the Essenes (and later the Cathars) were great assimilators of the Gnostic truths of noble teachers from the most ancient times. Given their connection to the Essenes we may surmise that the Cathars knew of the Egyptian and Aryan secrets of Light. Corroboration of this speculation is found in the Cathar’s language system, the Language of Oc, which I have identified as similar to the Language of the Birds. In Egypt, ak-h , phonetically oc , was the Pharaonic word for all aspects of light, particularly th e ‘transcendental’ light of the transfiguration. This word akh is written with a glyph showing a crested ibis (or heron) which was also called the akh .

Instead of teaching the sacred Grail science of Jesus, the Egyptian/Aryan/Atlantean science preserved by the noble Essenes (and revived by the Cathars), Paul separated himself and created his own religion. He positioned himself as the authority on Christ. In his letters to the Corinthians Paul cunningly set-up a conflict between the followers of Jesus and ‘Christianity’, his new, inspired religion: “I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.” He warned against those (read Jesus’ family and his closest associates) who tell of another Jesus, and another Gospel. He also warned against false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. “And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” 22 The other gospels Paul warned about likely refer to the massive Essene library at Qumran. Later, it included the Cathar Gospel of Love. In order to apprehend the Cathar Christology, and to understand the Cathar Christ, a brief look at the metaphysical symbolism of the Gnostic Cross and its relation to the Cube of Space will be helpful."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 254"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 255 15. THE CATHAR CHRIST In order to appreciate the ‘Cathar Christ’ we will start with a very simple Gnostic lesson in sacred geometry and the process by which the Deity brings the Universe into existence. From the Gnostic perspective, the process of creation begins with a point as the fundamental element; the point moves, and in so doing generates a one- dimensional line segment; the line moves one line segment unit down the page, and generates a two-dimensional plane; the plane, copying this process, moves one unit out of the page and generates a three-dimensional cube. If we move the image of the cube one unit out we get a picture of a four-dimensional hypercube, which is composed of four pairs of cubes. Can you follow the trail of the cube and find all four?"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 256 Hypercube This progression follows a powerful law. Each figure brings a new object or dimension into being which has its own characteristics, but which also contains – and includes the characteristics of – the object that spawned it. The cube contains the plane, which contains the line, which contains the point. Arthur Koestler has proposed the term h o l o n for organisms which at the same time can be wholes made up of parts, and parts of higher-level wholes. 1 Biochemist Rupert Sheldake uses the term morphic units . 2 At each level of evolution or unfoldment, the holons are wholes containing parts, which are themselves wholes containing lower-level holons, and so on. This process, says Sheldrake, can be used to describe shapes, subatomic particles in atoms, in molecules, in crystals, as well as cel ls in plants and tissues, in organs, in organisms. 3"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 257 Successive levels in a nested hiearchy of holons, or morphic units. The Gnostics used this idiom to describe the manner by which God projected Itself into existence and created new ‘worlds’. Each world contains the characteristics of the previous one, and simultaneously, the world to come. This process is referred to in spiritual terms in the book of Genesis when God creates Adam and Eve (from Adam’s crystalline bone) and then ‘projects’ or expels them from the spiritual state of the Garden of Eden into the ‘cube’ world. Most of us are stuck in this solid world with very little awareness of the spiritual state that preceded our existence, or the next ‘world’ to come, but which is already present all around us. This next world is a ‘hyper world’ or ‘hyper space’. Imagine you have been lifted up into hyperspace. What does this world look like? To begin with, says mathematician Rudy Rucker, 4 we would note that our 3-D space would cut 4-D hyperspace into two regions, just as a"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 258 0-D point cuts a 1-D line in two, a 1-D line cuts a 2-D plane in two, and a 2-D plane cuts a 3-D space into two. We call our 3-D world the ‘real world’. What shall we label the two regions of hyperspace determined by our space? One consciousness explorer who has considered this question is the great 19 th century hyperspace philosopher Charles H. Hinton. He suggested that we call them ana and kata to be used pretty much like the words up and down . 5 Hinton’s labeling of ana is purely coincidence. However, it is a master- stroke of synchronicity as far as I am concerned, since the hyper world is the world of the An or Ana. Hinton was completely absorbed by the idea of hyperspace. As a mathematician he knew that one couldn’t visualize a 4-D object in its entirety in our 3-D world. Most believe that because our brains are made up of 3-D nets of neurons it is futile to hope to model 4-D patterns in our brains. Hinton, on the other hand, believed that our 3-D world has hints of the 4-D world within it. If this is the case, then small parts of our neural net should be able to link with the 4-D net. This would make it possible, reasoned Hinton, to visualize a cross-section or the unraveling of a 4-D object. In this manner he believed that it was possible for our minds to acquire a conception of higher space as adequate as that of our three-dimensional space, and to use it in the same manner. 6 This would be a phenomenal ability. The fourth dimension contains the connective tissue that ties together the phenomena of our world and forms our reality.

Christ, they said, came from this dimension. How did he do this? The Gnostic Cross explains the process. According to Rudy Rucker, another way of representing a hypercube is by unfolding or unraveling one. 8 If we were to make a paper cube and cut some of its edges, we could flatten the cube down into a connected two-dimensional pattern of six equal squares making a cross. The six squares form the Gnostic Cross. These heretics followed Christ’s admonition to “take up the cross daily.” However, they did not symbolize this teaching by a wooden cross.

In Corpus Hypercubicus the crucifix is formed by eight cubic elements. The crucified Christ is suspended above the Earth, as if already in Heaven.

Dali’s message is clear in this context. By his crucifixion Christ performed an alchemical process and returned to the fourth dimension. What happens when we follow the Gnostic admonition to “take up the Cross” and attempt to follow Christ into the fourth dimension? As Hinton observed, we cannot fully imagine a 4-D world, only tiny fragments. In Madelein L’Engle’s novel A Wrinkle in Time she describes the hypercube. However, the classic example of life in an unraveled hypercube is Robert Heinlein’s science fiction short story “...And He Built a Crooked House.” 10 Heinlein’s protagonist is an architect who builds a house in the shape of a tesseract, a hypercube unraveled in the 3-D world. Built in the “City of Angels,” Los Angeles, the tesseract is a series of eight cubes stacked one on top of the other in the shape of a cross. Just as the house is completed an earthquake strikes Los Angeles, and the house collapses into itself, leaving only one cube standing. The other seven cubes have disappeared. Strangely, when the architect and the home’s owners enter the remaining cube they are astonished to see that the other seven cubes are visible through the windows on the first floor. They soon learn that no matter which room they enter they emerge in impossible and unexpected places. Worst of all, they find that there is no way out of the cube! In the study they open the four Venetian blinds only to discover they open windows in space leading to the Empire State Building, an ocean, Nothingness and a desert landscape."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 264 The architect and his client learn that an earthquake shook the house and it somehow folded up in four dimensions, leaving only the three-dimensional cube. Just as they come to believe there is no escape from this bizarre world another earthquake shakes the tesseract. Fearing for their life they leap from a window. When they land, they find themselves in Joshua Tree National Mountain near Palm Springs, California. Heinlein’s magical 4-D world initiates the reader into the hidden and powerful realm of the 4-D world through the creative imagination. Because of the combination of information, understanding and insight his work displays, it seems to me that his reference to Joshua, who stole the secrets of the gateway to higher worlds from the gods, is not by accident. Perhaps the most illuminating approach to understanding the hypercube comes from Rucker who asks us to imagine a hollow stone hypercube, analogous to a hollow stone prison. 11 What, he asks, would we see if this hypercubical prison was pushed through our space? Reasoning by analogy of the process of creation whereby the point becomes a line that becomes a cube, it is easy to see that if a hollow stone hypercube were to pass through our space we would first see a solid cube of stone, then a series of hollow stone cubes, and then a final stone cube. Rucker then makes an astonishing analogy. The hollow stone hypercube could serve as a prison cell in which a hyperbeing, say an angel, could be incarcerated. Think of the room you are in as having a solid stone floor, walls, and ceiling. Normally, an angel could escape the room by"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 265 moving ana , over, and kata . That is, the angel could make a right angle in hyperspace and ‘disappear’. This may be one reason why they are called Els . A right angle is an L-shape. If we think of multiple flattened hypercubes laid out like a chessboard (a favorite Templar symbol for the soul’s enmeshment in the grid of Earth), then, the angels have the ability to make Knight moves or L-shaped moves. Abraham, the father of the nation of seekers called Israel, was thought to have been in possession of the Emerald Tablets, which were in the shape of the tesseract. These were discovered by Abraham’s wife, Sarah, who wandered into a ‘cave’ and discovered the Tablets at the feet of Thoth, who at the time was in a state of suspended animation. 12 In The Secrets of Rennes-le-Chateau , 13 Lionel and Patricia Fanthorpe note that members of some ancient mystic cults have been said to meditate for hours upon the tesseract until they experienced a shift of perception -- th e opening of a gateway to another dimension. Once through this doorway, the individuals are greeted by beings from this dimension. This legend gives new light to the term Ibri (“Hebrew”) by which Abraham and his family was known. Ibri stems from Eber , which means, “to cross.” Ibri , says Sitchin, meant “a native of a place called “Crossing.” 14 He says that NI.IB.RU – the Crossing Place was the place where the pre-Deluvial Earth grids crossed each other, the original Navel or Tula of the Earth. 15 In this light Nibiru is the place of the crossing of the planes or dimensions.

In Genesis, Abraham is gazing out the door of his tent into the desert (a grid) on a hot day. 16 Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, the Lord and two messengers appear to him. Instead of gazing out a physical door, could Abraham have been gazing into the emerald tesseract, the doorway to other dimensions, to hyperspace? It is important to remember; Christ’s Court is described as a perfect crystalline cube. The Gnostics believed that the soul was composed of an immaterial and imperishable crystalline substance. It emanated from the highest, finest realm and became entangled in the Sea of Glass, and then the prison-house of the body and the spell of Earth... that, in the Gnostic scheme, is Lucifer’s Court. Another way to explain the ‘prison’ or metaphysical cell of Earth life is in terms of the Planetary Grid or Energy Network of the Earth. The Indians called this crystal web, or Grid, the domain of the creator goddess “Spider Woman”. 17 To the Hindus Gaia or Kali , Earth life, was the Soul’s kiss of death. The Soul, once free to roam the galaxies, is suddenly licked up by her long red tongue (blood) and finds itself enmeshed in the clay (DNA) of Kali. This is why the beautiful blue-white object floating innocently in the blackness of space beside its star was simultaneously known as the birth-and-death Mother, a womb and tomb.

So did Nostradamus. Terra or Earth’s crystal web has a geometric shape. In his discourse Phaeado , Plato records the astonishing revelation of Socrates in the last moments before his execution that “ the true Earth itself looks from above, if you could see it, like those twelve-patched leather balls ”. A twelve-patched leather ball describes a dodecahedron. The dodecahedron with twelve five-sided faces was used as a teaching tool to instruct the initiate to know him or herself as an energy system like the Earth."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 268 Remarkably, Plato is describing Earth as a three- dimensional pentagonal web into which the soul incarnates. The ancient Greeks likely learned from the Egyptians that the human body is ideally structured geometrically to interface with the dodecahedron and its pentagonal grid. Plato was not alone in his understanding of the 12-sided Earth. As we have seen, the Cherokee held a complimentary belief. In addition, the second century AD, a group of Christian Gnostics described the sphere of Earth being surrounded by a 12-angled pyramid. These 12 angles are described as “eyes”, “pipes,” and even more fascinating to our investigation, as “holes” or “halls” in the Earth! 19 These , it appears, are the crystal halls of Lucifer’s Court. These same 12 halls are the disciples or halls leading to Christ’s Court. Today, most researchers into sacred Earth energies concur that the Planetary Grid has 12 primary vortex zones, “halls” or “holes” with the Great Pyramid at the apex control. 20 A network of temple sites throughout the Earth marks the Grid. These sites roughly include: • the Great Pyramid of Giza and Heliopolis (“the City of the Sun”) • the massive 1,000 foot high pyramids in the jungles of southern China, 90 degrees opposite of Giza. • Easter Island, 180 degrees opposite the Great Pyramid. • the City of the Sun at prehistoric Cuzco, Peru. • Teotihuacan in Mexico. • the vortices of the Four Corners area of the USA. • the Mississippi valley of the southeastern USA. • Oak Island, Nova Scotia."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 269 • the South of France, centered at Rennes-le-Chateau, France.

The Quickening of our civilization is a result of the “quick-beams” or “quick-rays” emanating from the core of our galaxy. As a result, the crystal halls of Lucifer’s court come alive.

THE LADY OF THE HOUSE The Church launched a propaganda war against the Cathar’s competing Christology. Propaganda, however, was not enough to dissuade the Pure Ones. The Church next sought to neutralize the threat posed by them by dispatching emissaries to debate and convert them. When its best envoys failed to convert these heretics of the Church of Love the Church of Rome called in gun-for-hire Simon de Montford to exterminate these people to guarantee its own survival and put forth itself as the only (blood-soaked) hand of God. From 1209-1249 the first European genocide was conducted against the Cathars by Pope Innocent III and a coalition force including French Catholics. Promising spiritual rewards in exchange for the blood of the Cathars, he sent 30,000 enforcers into the Midi and nearby Languedoc to eradicate the Church of Love. The crusade in which the Roman Catholic Church took flame and sword against the Cathars was a conflict where ROMA (Rome) and its mirror image AMOR (‘love’) stood opposite each other. The Cath ari c was the (‘pure’) religion of Jesus. The Cath ol ic (‘universal’) religion about Jesus was the one inspired by Paul. The Cathar religion was based on the other gospel Paul warned about."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 272 Fascinatingly, the difference between the Cath ol ic and Cath ari c Christianity is perfectly encoded in the difference between the word elements o l and a r or ari that differentiate these two words. Ol means all . All is the whole. It speaks to the desire of the Cath-ol-ic Church to be the universal religion. Ar means ‘before’. 1 Ar is the root for Arian or Aryan. Aryan means “noble,” “cultured” or ‘high born’. Hence, the ari element of the word Cath ari c . While some may argue that I am taking poetic license here, Otto Rahn, as a student of linguistics assuredly knew that the Cathar’s treated language as fossil poetry. Like a geological sample, words have various levels of meaning. The further one digs into these meanings, the closer one gets to its original meaning. According to one of the Bird Language’s foremost principles, words of similar phonetic resonance are considered to be explanatory of one another. The meanings of words at all levels are explanatory of words on other levels. One of the features of the Language of the Birds has been termed onomatapoesis , or name poetry whereby place names express not only a specific quality or place, but whatever we want it to mean! This alone gives us good reason to link the Cathars with the pure, noble or Aryan tradition. History reveals more substantial cause. In fact, the conflict between the Catholic and the Catharic or Aryan heresy go deep into the roots of Christianity. A r i is the root for A r i a n , the heretical Christian doctrine. During the pivotal first council of Nicea, convened in 325 by Constantine I, at which many of the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 273 tenets of Christianity were formalized, a ferocious debate erupted between two Alexandrian priests. Arius, who proclaimed that God and Christ were separate entities, represented the first Alexandrian school. According to Arian doctrine, Jesus was immortal and the ‘first created’ (the Adam), but he stood somewhere between God and man. The Bishop of Alexandria, Athanasius, who argued that God, the Holy Ghost and Christ are of the same essence, represented the counter-view. When it voted, the council sided with Athanasius. The Arian view became heresy. The Nicean Creed was adopted. The Christian religion practiced by billions of people today was born. The Egyptian association prompts us to more deeply consider the meaning of the A r root in the Egyptian language. According to the Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary , 3 Ar means, “to make do, to create, to form, to fashion.” It is the root of Ari , the creative god. 4 As noted, the original Hebrew word for carpenter was naggar . It meant “fashioner.” Christ the carpenter, I concluded, was a fashioner of light. In Egyptian, Ari-en means “made by, produced by the lady of the house ’. 5 Ari-en , of course, is the same as Aryan . This word- working powerfully illustrates the interest Rahn had in the Cathars. It suggests their connection to the secrets of creation , which, in this case, were wielded by a goddess called the Lady of the House , whose products (humans) were called Arien or Aryan . This description, ‘to create, to form, and to fashion’, sounds remarkably as if this ‘creative goddess’ wielded the secrets of creation. Of outstanding importance in this"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 274 description is the way it matches the Egg of Creation, an awesome facility located on the Giza Plateau created in the Egyptian First Time, which both the Sumerian and Egyptian mythologists recorded. In the Egyptian tradition , the story of this Egg and the Pure Mound is contained in the Edfu Inscriptions found at the Temple of Horus at Edfu, a temple dedicated to bringing the Sun god to Earth. This description also matches the ‘House of Life’ of the Sumerian tradition. The reason the Church resorted to mass murder to keep the Cathars in check most certainly had to do with their alternative views about Jesus. However, it was ultimately for their Aryan – or Atlantean – connection and its linkage to the goddess or Lady of the House and her amazing secrets that assured their extermination. As the children of Amor the Cathars match-up with the Amorites, the children of the goddess Mari or M- Ari , who was called “the lady of the House.” They are the Saba. Despite the Church’s best effort, both the Lady of the House and the sacred knowledge of AMOR dove underground and continued to flourish sub rosa . The Cathar’s Aryan connection is further affirmed in their connection to the Sumerian god E.A., who came to Earth in the company of a group of the blond gods called Anunnaki, the sons of the great Anu. Here is the connection to the Cathars and E.A. Whenever archaeologists discovered remains of the early Sumerian civilizations, including Akkad, the symbol of the “Planet of the Gods” was prominently displayed. The name for their home was Nibiru or NAM.TILLA.KU , “the god who maintains life.” Nam.Tilla.Ku literally means Name or"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 275 Destiny (NAM) of God (KU) is Tula (TILLA). Tula was known to the Akkadians as the: • “bestower of cultivation,” • creator or grain and herbs who causes vegetation to sprout,” • who opened wells, apportioning waters of abundance ,” and • irrigator of Heaven and Earth.” 6 The Akkadian astronomical and religious beliefs maintained Nam.Tilla.Ku was a twelfth planet in our solar system. They sometimes called it the Lord. The pictographic sign for this planet was a three-nail cross . 7 The cuneiform cross sign was composed of three wedge-like symbols that resemble nails. This three-nail cross sign says Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin, meant “Anu” and “divine.” It evolved, he says, in the Semitic languages to the letter T or tau . Anu was another name for the ultimate a-tom of the Theosophists. If the a-tom is the sun, Tula, the Anu, is the sun behind the sun. In 1203, four years before the attack on the Cathars, the Church’s search for Christian relics was massively underway. Relic worship did a thriving business during these times. Enormous sums of money were transferred from the faithful’s wallets to the Church’s coffers if a piec e of the true cross or other such vestiges of the life of Jesus could be displayed at a church. Most, if not all, of these relics were forgeries. Given the widespread fraud perpetrated by the vicars of Christ, and the propensity of the faithful to submit to"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 276 Church authority, why not simply manufacture an agreeable-looking cup, issue a papal mandate declaring the cup the Grail Chalice of Christ, and promote the tale that the Grail has been found once and for all? It is surely because those ‘in the know’ understand that there is much more to the Grail than meets the eye. The Grail is far more than a cup. As I have explored in The A ~ tomic Christ and Blue Apples , to esotericists it is a mystery teaching of enormous military power. Those who possess it are not contenders to the throne. They possess the throne. Those aspiring to dominate the world and form a crytocracy, as for example the Church must wrest these mystery teachings from those who possess them. Failing this they must discredit or demonize the teaching and its purveyors or even eliminate them altogether. In the early thirteenth century, the Crucifixion was typically depicted with Christ affixed to the cross with fou r nails, one placed through each of his hands and feet. During the Albigensian (Cathar) Crusade, reports were circulated of a three-nail crucifixion. This gave Pope Innocent III all the ammunition he needed. He proclaimed an official four- nail dogma and condemned as heretics anyone who asserted the use of three nails. This three-nail, four-nail Crucifixion business may sound petty. However, there is a lot riding on the distinction between the two. “In an attempt to win converts,” says Shroud of Turin researcher Jack Markwardk, some Cathars employed a crucifix which had no upper arm (a T), the feet of Christ crossed, and three nails.”"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 277 There is a mystery here, he says, of why Cathars, who rejected the reality of Christ’s death, would assert a three - nail crucifixion or employ a three-nail crucifix, particul arly when attempting to proselytize orthodox believers who were accustomed to, and who were bound to believe in, a four-nail “spread-eagle” portrayal. A close examination o f the Shroud of Turin reveals that only one nail pierced Christ’s feet and the Cathars’ possession of the cloth with its evidence of the use of one nail through both feet crossed would explain their assertion of a three-nail crucifixion. Their use of the Bird Language also links them with Jesus. The Cathars had clearly drawn a knowledge line in the sand, possibly based upon actual knowledge from the Shroud, which contradicted the traditional and papally mandated (mis)beliefs of the conventional Christians in Rome. \u0001 Markwardk does not offer any additional explanation or further elucidation regarding the Cathar three-nail Cross mystery. Speculative though this may be, I have found an explanation for the meaning of the three-nail cross in symbol of the Anu .

Many of these plates tell picture stories of the Crucifixion. Altho ugh condemned out of hand as fraudulent by archaeologists, the so-called “Michigan Plates” or “Soper Savage Collections” continue to intrigue independent antiquarians, who believ e the artifacts were made by a Middle Eastern religious community living in the upper Midwest during the 4th Century A.D or earlier! 9 This, of course, is impossible to ‘official’ historians.

This symbol is a three-nail H (the symbol for the Eucharist and the Fish God) accompanied by two additional nails. An identical ‘mystic H symbol’ was discovered in Illinois on a stone artifact portraying a Christian resurrection. The three-nail H or Mystic Symbol appears on the front cover of a book published in 1910 in Michigan. It is believed that the mark beneath it means “Son-of-the-Right- Hand.” A man nailed to a cross is shown with the mystic symbol above his head. In the 1950s, a Chicago lawyer named Henrietta Mertz was the first researcher to identify the"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 280 “tribal mark or mystic symbol” as she called it. She claims this Mystic Symbol stands for IHS, the three-letter abbreviation of the name of Jesus in Greek. The H symbolizes the Ladder to Heaven and the secrets of transmuting the elements, including splitting the a-tom . Obviously, the three nail-cross of the Cathars or the H , symbolizes unique factual knowledge concerning the Shroud and possibly the Crucifixion which reveals the use of three nails. Why would the pope outlaw this knowledge and insist on a four-nail crucifixion? Was it because it was the three-nail ‘H’ was tribal mark of a group of space beings? Historians dismiss the Michigan tablets as forgeries. Nullifying this claim is the fact that the mystic symbol appears on many of the thousands of Michigan tablets (most of which are now in the possession of the Church of Latter Day Saints in Utah.) The sheer number of the artifacts suggests that an individual or a group of individuals would have had to toil for years to expedite this conspiracy. This seems unlikely. However, this is not the only fact supporting their authenticity. In his investigation of the Michigan relics, David Deal was able to convincingly translate from the quasi-Hebrew script on the “Christ stones” the name of two sons of a deity-figure featured on the Michigan tablets as “Son-of-the-Right-Hand” and “Son-of-the-Left Hand.” 10 In biblical stories told on the tablets, these figures engage in a mythic battle of light and dark. These characters are more than strikingly similar to AMOR and ROMA, the two complimentary gods of the Cathar scheme of things. In 1947 the Dead Sea Scrolls revealed that the"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 281 Essenes believed there is a cosmic battle between the “sons of Light” and the “sons of Darkness” (also known as the “Congregation of Baal”). Deal writes, “the fact that the Michigan Christians of the Fourth Century AD were aware of this angelic conflict and modern Christians are not, is th e major point to ponder.” 11 How did the people of Michigan learn about this conflict in 400 AD, fifteen hundred years before the rest of the world? I have already noted the traditions of a mysterious, white, bearded visitor from across the ocean that date to well before the time Columbus even thought of venturing to America. This man was universally known as a Peacemaker and culture-bringer. Might it have been he who brought this symbol to America? Could this three nail H be the same as the three nail cross of the Cathars, and the symbol for the transmutation of the elements? Did Christ plant the secrets of the H in America or Amor-ica? One other point is worth pondering. The symbol of the Sphinx, which the Arabs called ‘the Father of Terror’, is the lion, bull, eagle (with wings missing) and man. These are the symbols of the four constellations marking the Cube of Space. This is also the symbol of the Right Hand of God spoken of in the Book of Revelation which features Jesus sitting on what appears to be the Cube of Space. Is this the source of Isaiah’s bizarre report of seeing Earth from a great distance in space? Exalting the Lord, Isaiah said of him: “It is he who sitteth upon the circle of the Earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers.” The Sumerian texts describe how E.A. created humanity from his own blood or genetic material.

Ninharsag was called the Lady of Form-giving, Lady Fashioner and Lady of the Embryo. 13 She matches up with M- Ari and Arien , the “Lady of the House.” E.A. was known as a metallurgist and an alchemist.

It is useful to know that to represent the idea of ‘love’ the Sumerians drew a simple vase or jar with a burning torch inside to indicate the fermenting heat of gestation in the womb. This symbol simultaneously suggests the heart-center of our Milky Way galaxy, Tula, the human heart and a vase or Grail.

In fact, in this scene we are told by the Sumerians, E.A. is waving his “Exalted Scepter and Staff.” This is the caduceus , of which, among other things, legends tell us can be used to infuse lifeless matter with life force and to conduct souls between dimensions! Later, it was depicted in the hands of Thoth and Jesus. Ninharsag was later renamed the archangel Gabri-El (‘God’s Hero’) in the Christian tradition. Now, this is fascinating. This Goddess was depicted by the Sumerians as the Green Woman, the Gardeneress, so to speak. Gabri- El later appeared to the ‘Virgin Mary or Mari ’, alerting her that she would soon conceive the Christ child, Jesus, who fulfilled the archetype of the Sun god. In Egypt, the lady of the house, Gabri-el/Ninharsag, was Isis, the Egyptian Mother of Love, who was called the Rainbow (an arc) Goddess and the mother of all the elements . These fantastic connections enable me to speculate that the Cathars were the offspring of the Anunnaki, specificall y of E.A. and Ninharsag. In order to more fully make this connection, and to elucidate the profound revelations contained therein, it is necessary to make a momentary digression to explore the Epic of Gilgamesh , the Sumerian tale that tells the story of Utnapushtim."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 286"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 287 17.

His previous journey makes it clear that Gilgamesh has arrived at a celestial, as opposed to an earthly, sea. Perhaps the Sea of Glass? Siduri warns Gilgamesh of the danger that lies ahead and advises him to return home, and to abandon the search for immortality, because the cruel gods decreed that all human beings must die. Humans were, after all, created only to serve the gods according to Sumerian myth. She tells Gilgamesh to return home, to take pleasure in the good things in life while he can: to bathe and dress himself, eat and drink, play with his children, make love to his wife, and “make every day a festival.” Shamash, the Sun god, appears and tells him the same thing. Still, Gilgamesh insists on being shown the way to Utnapushtim. Siduri warns him that no mortal has been able to cross the sea, but if he insists, he must find Urshanabi, the boatman of Utnapushtim.

Those with a stellar mindset align Siduri with Calypso, whose sacred island Ogyia is called by Homer “the Navel of the Sea.” Calypso, in turn, is compared to the goddess Scorpio, who dwells at the end of the Milky Way, where she receives the souls of the dead. Dante posted centaurs at the entrance of the underworld, representing Sagittarius. These stellar markers, Scorpio and Sagittarius, are highly significant. Though invisible to the naked eye the writers of the Epic of Gilgamesh appear to be pointing to the location of the Galactic Core, also called Thule or Hyperborea. The astrological sign glyphs for Sagittarius and Scorpio are the only two that feature arrows, and both are beside each other. When arranged as they appear in the sky, the two pointers face each other. The tip of Sagittarius, the Archer’s arrow is the orange colored sta r Gamma Sagittarii. Dr. Paul LaViolette concludes that the arrows of Sagittarius and Scorpio appear intended to point to Asclepius the ‘Serpent Holder’, a ‘missing’ thirteenth constellation named after the god of healing, as the constellation nearest the Galactic Center. 1 This constellation is the heavenly home of the An. Did the writers of the Epic of Gilgamesh know this? Another group whose symbology focused on this constellation was the Cathars, otherwise known as Albi- gensians, the White Ones, from Alba , the White (or Pure) Land, another name for Hyperborea. 2 In their secret watermarks, catalogued by Harold Bayley, 3 an ox is seen with the serpent of Ascelpius, the symbol of healing, wound around a cross or a Tree of Life.

It is the Word or El-e-mental Life Force energy upon which the World is constructed. Its mystic meaning is the unification of spirit and matter. This is why Jesus is described as a carpenter. He is ‘wood’ worker, i.e. a ‘Word worker’ or ‘worker of the El-e-mental life substance’.

He asks him how he entered the company of the gods and attained immortality. Utnapushtim discloses to Gilgamesh “a secret matter, a secret of the gods.” Utnapushtim tells him the incredible story of the Deluge. He tells how before the Flood a council of the gods voted on the destruction of humankind. The vote was kept secret. But E.A. warned Utnapushtim of Enlil’s, E.A.’s half-brother’s, decision to wipe out mankind. Enlil was displeased by E.A.’s creation of humanity, and sought to destroy them.

Sumerian depictions show them stark naked serving their masters who are fully clothed. Enlil, in particular, served up massive cruelty upon these beings, including giving them only sub-human food and living conditions.

Just before the Deluge Utnapushtim loaded his family and all the craftsmen who helped him build the Ark, as well as an assortment of living creatures into the craft.

In the Babylonian version the goddess Ninharsag (Ishtar/Inanna), the Queen of Heaven, cries before the Flood, “Why did I command this evil in the council of all the gods?... I brought them (humans) forth. Now like the spawn of fish they float in the ocean.” The Anunnaki gods wept with her. In Gilgamesh she blames Enlil for the Flood, making it clear that the Flood was a preventable and premeditated act of genocide on the part of this god. She swears by her jeweled necklace, the rainbow, that she will remember these awful days in the relationship between man and the gods. When at last Enlil arrives he wonders how it was possible that any humans had survived the cataclysm. No humans were supposed to have lived. Realizing that only E.A. could be responsible for the survival of humanity, Enlil confronted his half-brother. E.A. argued that he did not directly tell Utnaphustim the secret of the gods. He merely told Utnapushtim to meet him at a reed screen. “I let Utnapushtim see a dream, and he perceived the secret of the gods,” said E.A. On this basis, reasoned Enki, humanity should be allowed to survive and prosper. He counseled Enlil (on whose image the priestly"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 295 compilers of the Flood story in Genesis based the jealous god Yahweh) to be merciful. With this Enlil entered the cube. He bade Utnapushtim and his wife to kneel before him. He touched their foreheads and blessed them. “Henceforth Utnapushtim and his wife shall be unto us like gods. Utnaphustim shall reside in the Far Away, at the Mouth of the Waters.” After he was taken to the Far Away, the Abode of the Gods near the Healing Sun by my calculations, Enlil “gave him life like a god, elevated him to eternal life, like a god.” And this, Utnapushtim told Gilgamesh, was the story of how he became immortal, and a member of the race of the Ana, who walks the crystal halls of the Lord’s Court. As Gilgamesh is preparing his return to Uruk he bids goodbye on the shore. Utnapushtim’s wife asks her husband to give the traveler a gift. The wise man decides to give Gilgamesh a “hidden thing” and a secret of the gods . This plant, he tells him, like the buckthorn has thorns that will prick like the rose . If Gilgamesh finds the plant he will have new life. No sooner had Gilgamesh heard this then he jumped into the water and saw the plant. He took it into his hands. He tells Urshanabi the boatman that he will return this plant of life to Uruk. After travelling thirty leagues o n their way home Gilgamesh took a swim. A serpent snuffed the fragrance of the plant, came up from the water, and carried off the plant. Going back it shed its skin. This is how the serpent of Asclepius came to symbolize the wisdom of immortality. As Sitchin records, this episode was only the beginning of the antagonisms between E.A. and Enlil.

JESUS: OF THE ANA RACE The Epic of Gilgamesh reveals that there were survivors of the Flood (which may have been the cataclysm of Atlantis). How many is not known. However, we are told that among the survivors there were ‘craftsmen’. This infers technology. I find it intriguing that Utnapushtim’s Akkadian name was Atrahasis , meaning “the far wise.” This epithet was also used to describe an extra wise Uguartic god of craftsmen named Kathar, called ‘ the Skilful and Percipient One ’, who constructed a temple (cube-shaped?) for the Lord Baal. 1 Phonetically, Kathar is the same word as Cathar. I find this intriguing. Taking this intrigue one step further we find that the Islamic people called this sage Al-Khidr , the Green Man who guarded the Fountain of Life and gave water (wisdom/baptism) from it to kings. As the letters ‘d’ and ‘t’ are interchangeable, the word Khidr can easily be bent like a guitar string into Khitr and Kathar. The Islamic people believed that the Old Testament prophet Elijah was Al-Khidr. 2 John the Baptizer had the spirit and power of Elijah, leading many to believe he was the reincarnated prophet. 3 Adding these definitions together, it seems quite"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 298 possible that there is in the least a poetic connection between the survivor of the Flood, Kathar (Atrahasis), Al Khidr, the Green Man who baptized kings, John the Baptist, and the Cathars. According to the principles of the Bird Language the terms Cathar, Kathar, Green Man and Baptizer are interchangeable. By this principle John the Baptist is a Cathar, or a Pure One. Now this is a substantial claim, and, as we shall see I will substantiate it. However, this is not the end of wonders of this word working by a long way. Even more fantastically, the Green Man is considered the immortal ruler of Hyperborea, and the King of Tula. Putting this together with the “John the Baptist is a Cathar” claim, formulates a proposal of Atlantean proportions: John the Baptist may have been a king of Tula, like Quetzalcoatl. When he baptized Jesus in the river Jordan 4 -- or Eridanus -- he may have been educating him in the ‘old time’ Hyperborean religion of the Ana. The key symbol that links the Ana and Christianity is the dove of the Holy Spirit which flew into Jesus’ mouth at his baptism by John the Baptist in the River Jordan. 5 ‘Dove’ comes from Oannes, the Babylonian name for E.A., meaning dove. In the olden texts the ancients tell us Tiamat was once one of the Pleiades, a star cluster in the constellation Taurus the Bull. It is crucial to note that the ancients used a dove as a symbol for Tiamat. The Babylonias called the Pleiades the Flock of Doves. 6 The Greeks called them the Atlantides."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 299 At the annual Babylonian re-enactment of the splitting of Tiamat (and its Atlantis-like sinking into the waters of the night), a dove was split in half, in imitation of An’s splitting of Tiamat.

DO NOT TOUCH ME If true, this is a breathtakingly powerful piece of information. In the Gospel of John, the only Gospel read by the Cathars, Mary Magdalene encounters a Gardener outside of Jesus’ ‘tomb’ at first light on Easter morning. 7 Jesus had been missing for three days, his whereabouts unknown. Mary waited at the tomb, weeping for her companion Jesus. 2 Suddenly, from within the tomb appeared two angels dressed in white. The angels ask her why she is crying. “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” 9 Upon hearing this, she turns around and sees a man standing nearby. This is not just any man. According to the “official” church, this man is none other than Jesus. Politely, submissively, angrily, we cannot tell which (but certainly with emotion, perhaps with emotion tinged with respect), she says to him: “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” 10"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 300 Jesus says to her, “Mary.” Startled, she turns and addresses him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (a special Hebrew term for Teacher that denotes God). She rushes to his arms, but he stops her saying, “Do not touch me.” 11 This scene is as confusing as it is extraordinary. First of all, how could a woman who was Jesus’ close companion and disciple not recognize him? Was it because it was dark? Was it because she was crying? Was he disguised? Was his face mutilated from the Crucifixion? Or, was he in some ethereal form, perhaps a body of light? Hence, his inability to be touched? None of these explanations are satisfactory. In fact, they raise the even more important question of why, of all people, would Jesus appear as the gardener? Think about how names (labels) represent icons. Today, when we say the “Terminator” we think of Arnold Schwartzeneggar. Likewise, Christoper Reeve represents “Superman.” But, who thinks of Jesus as the Gardener? When Jesus is titled “the gardener,” the significance of this label can not be underestimated. Nor can the early Christian community who recorded this event have misunderstood it. Nothing in the New Testament symbolism is given by chance. They knew exactly to whom the name the Gardener referred. If John the Baptist appeared along with Jesus on Easter morning, this would be a phenomenal key to the secrets of the Crucifixion and Resurrection. The appearance of the Gardener suggests an answer to the question of just exactly where Jesus spent his three days in between Crucifixion, Resurrection and Transfiguration . The location is Tula, the Healing Sun."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 301 My sense is that the “Gardener code” in the Gospel of John was put there to reveal the notion that Jesus had completed his transformation, ala Utnapushtim (Atrahasis or Kathar) into the race of the Ana. He had traveled to the realm of the gods and returned with proof of his mission. He returned with the King of Tula in tow. The Gardener who appeared on Easter morning was a separate person. This is why Jesus’ story does not yield the archetypal symbolism of the Gardener. John the Baptist’s story, on the other hand, does. This detail deserves further research and clarification. John the Baptist is something of an enigma in the Christian world. He is introduced as the forerunner or herald of Jesus, a role that, at first, appears subservient. However, John’s disciples, and even John himself, viewed him differently. “Among those born of women,” said Jesus, “none is greater than John.” He was viewed not as a lesser teacher than Jesus was, but as a Christ himself, perhaps even in competition with Jesus. 12 From the very beginning of their relationship members of the church were confused about the relationship between these two. Stiff competition between the followers of Jesus and the followers of John (who called themselves Mandaeans) insured that this confusion would continue, and that preachers would expend considerable energy trying to deny the Christhood of one of these prophets. An important Hyperborean detail concerning John’s life is found in the legend that shortly after his birth John was mysteriously taken to a place called Paran , “the white mountain.” His mother, Elizabeth, did not see him again until he was 22, when he was brought on a ‘cloud of"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 302 splendor’ (a UFO?) and set down in a region of Jerusalem. Shortly after, John began his ministry. The “White Mountain” is the “pure mountain” and is a distinct reference to Tula. It is the Mount of Salvation. Thi s is the same mountain where Sarah took Isaac after his birth; where the children of Israel camped during the Exodus, and where the “cloud” was taken of the Ark of the Covenant; 13 where the Lord had a sanctuary; 14 where the Lord came forth with ten thousand saints and a fiery law in his right hand; 15 and from here Moses dispatched men to spy out the land of Canaan. Fascinatingly, the Greeks had a name for signs of constellations that rise together during transitional moments in human history. They were called paranatellonta . 16 The four signs Leo, Taurus, Aquarius, and Scorpio are the paranatellonta of one another. Could it be that the biblical events revolving around the p a r a n refer to special astrological times as well? By the time Jesus returned from his own so-called missing seventeen years John had attracted a considerable following. Indeed, John was taken to be the Messiah, and Jesus was later thought to be the resurrected John the Baptist! The contrast and tension between John and Jesus is most plainly recorded in the Gospel of Luke. 17 Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of the disciples asked Jesus to “teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.” Now, if we think about it, this is a bit of a slap in the face. John had previously proclaimed Jesus the Christ.

To me, this is akin to a person saying to Michael Jordan, “Michael, can you teach me to play basketball like Larry Bird?” In response, Jesus utters the Lord’s Prayer. “Our father, who art in Heaven....” In the 19 th century the great Egyptologist Sir E.A. Wallis Budge traced the origins of the opening of the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ to an ancient Egyptian prayer to Osiris- Amon. 18 This prayer begins ‘Amon, Amon who art in heaven...’ This clearly indicates that the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ was in existence long before the time of Jesus and John.

These definitions reveal a direct connection between the followers of John the Baptist, the Neter gods of Egypt, and the Sumerian gods of An. The Egyptian word neter is also rendered as nuter or Nu , 24 the root for nuclear . The Neter were the male god- beings of Egypt. Nu-trit , “nurturer,” was the feminine for neter. 25 In the Book of the Dead neter is mentioned in connection to the power to “renew life indefinitely.” 26 This power is the ultimate nurturing secret of light (Luz, Salem, Tula). Budge notes that neter was a term used to denote a quality of soul. 27 As it is mentioned in opposition to “the dead,” he says, it appears to refer to a “living” or “strong” soul. 28 In my view, another way of describing this strong soul would be pure . Confirmation of this conclusion is provided by the Egyptian term Ka , which refers to the Divine Spirit. The upraised arms symbolize the Ka . These definitions of neter paint footprints on the floor that lead to the speculation that, perhaps as a Neter himself , John the Baptist possessed not only the nurturing secrets of immortality, but also the secrets of the destructive nuclea r powers of light. At the baptism, he transferred these secret s to Jesus. With this foundation in place we now more fully appreciate the fact that, in Egypt, Osiris was the ‘gardener ’ or Green Man.

To repeat, the Emerald Tablet reveals the secrets of the El-e- mental substance, the Blue Apples, of which we are made.

The word ark is preserved in the word argilla-ceous , that is, “made of clay.” 30 The Green Man has vegetation spewing from his mouth because he utters the keys to Tula and other important cosmic knowledge. In Sufism this knowledge is called “rukn” or “rukn al- arkan , the World-Temple of God . It is known as the “the fifth angle of the edifice.” What these terms appear to be inferring is that the Green Man is a fifth angel or angle on the Ark or Cube of Space. He is the way out.

Moses even complained that the Israelites had forgotten this: “Of the Rock that begat thee thou are unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee,” said Moses. 31 In what can be considered more than a mere coincidence, we find that the Sanskrit word arka means “ray” or “flash.” 32 This is why the Green Man wields the Green Ray.

One reason for this is that throughout the ages the overwhelming majority of conventional Christians have thought of the Holy Grail in its exoteric sense, as a simple carpenter’s cup whose history originated with Jesus. Abraham’s story provides one of the most powerful clues to the lost science of Christ’s Court.

Psalm 110:4 insists Melchizedek was an early Christ prototype when it states that Jesus, “The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, thou art a priest forever after the Order of Melchizedek .” This is repeated in Hebrews 6:20 where Paul directly connects Jesus with the lineage of Melchizedek. Melchizedek is described in four verses of Hebrews 7:1-4. He comes from out of nowhere “without father, without mother, without descent, having neither the beginning of days, or end of life; but made like unto the Son of God.” It was to him that Abraham gave a tithe (one tenth) of his wealth.

The Gnostics, including the Cathars used these statements to support their dualistic claim that evil not only rules Earth but created it. The object of Earth life was to escape it. Melchizedek’s initiation of Abraham provides a key. The key to elucidating Melchizedek’s and Jesus’ esoteric teaching concerning the Eucharist is to remember that the bread and wine used at the Last Supper to produce the Grail substance are called the elements . The letter H symbolizes the mystery teaching behind these elements. Mystics claim the addition of the H signified Abraham’s acquisition of the “breath of God” or “soul of God.” Simultaneously, his wife Sara became Sarah, suggesting she too received this “breath” or “soul.” Some trace the secrets of the H to the Garden of Eden and Adam, who was also known as Adama- h . The H represented the transformation of Abraham and Sarah from humans to something more than human. This same transformation has been subliminally attached to the"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 323 mythology of Jesus. Who has ever heard the expletive “Jesus H . Christ!” and not wondered what it meant or where it originated? The name Jesus was spelled IHCOYC or IHEOYE in Greek. Two Greek letters are used as lower values of E. 3 Thus the three-letter equation used in the west for Jesus is JHS or IHS: Jesus the Savior of Humanity. The IHS term is also interpreted as “ I have suffered ,” and “ In this sign conquer .” When Constantine placed the sign on his labarum in 312 AD, he included the words “in this sign, conquer.” It is the source of the expletive “Jesus H . Christ.” The H is a two-edged sword. A perfect example of the creator/destroyer-healer/conqueror duality which I am suggesting surrounds the meaning of the H , is provided by the meaning of a single white H on a blue background on signs which dot the highways of America. This H always means hospital , and represents a place that offers the most advanced medical technology in the world. Similarly, in the mystic mind of the Gnostics at the time of Jesus, the H represented a group of intertwined healing sciences that combined to form the secrets of the Grail. These healing sciences combined to form what I will call the science of salvation . The way to exit the Earth was to find H , the Ladder to Heaven, which angels ascended and descended. The eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Cheth, symbolized this ladder. Cheth means “a field,” something perceived, or that can be cultivated – in short, spiritual perception. The picture of Cheth shows two pillars united by one crossbeam, resembling a doorway. Two other similar"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 324 symbols are He (Head) and Tau (Cross). Only Cheth represents the two pillars in perfect balance. Cheth, at the end of words, is pronounced “ach” or H. The initiate walked between two of the columns of H -- or I I -- to enter the Grail temple. Within the temple he was confronted by two more pillars before entering the Holy of Holies. 3 These two pillars, topped by the crossbeam, indicated that the initiate had balanced the inner duality of light and dark. This letter resembles the ancient erections of stone, including Stonehenge, found throughout the ancient world. It is used to denote the number 8. The Hebrew letter H e t h means “a field,” and symbolically represents the union of two worlds. 4 As the Ladder between the two worlds, Cheth, 8 or H, itself has been called a “field of unlimited possibilities.” 3 This sounds like a description of the Sea of Glass to me. In the view of salvation scientists the soul in volves or folds itself in the field of human experience, the matrix or matter of earth life, and e volves or unfolds out of it. This is the significance of the H or 8. The key to understanding the H ’s connection to the body is to realize the H and 8 are interchangeable. The 8 guides humanity’s growth. We are figure 8’s in our skeletal structure, emphasized by the eight joints of our limbs. Our vertical skeletal structure, coupled with the rungs of our spinal cord system, forms an inner “Ladder to Heaven.” For Catholics the Holy Grail is the focal point of the sacrifice of the Mass, and also the mystery of the Holy Communion in which Jesus’ body is offered in the form of"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 325 bread along with the communal wine, the ‘Blood of Life’. At the Last Supper/First Communion Jesus presented the bread and wine (called the elements ) to the disciples in the Upper Room in Jerusalem on the eve of the Crucifixion. As he poured wine for the disciples to drink he said, “this is my blood.” He then presented bread. Jesus said, “Whoso eateth my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life.” 5 This celebration is called the Eucharist , the Love Feast. At the temple at Capernaum Jesus taught, “... he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from Heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live forever.” 6 Christian doctrine states that Jesus was the only Son of God who came to Earth to sacrifice himself in order that all humans would be healed or cleansed of sin. In Christian theology the doctrine of con substantiation states that the substance of the bread and wine of the Eucharist exist, after consecration by an official of the Church, side by side with the substance of the body and blood of Christ, but is not changed into it. 7 In other words, imagining this substance is Christ’s risen body makes it so. This is accomplished through the intention of the believer. The next day, either Joseph of Arimathea or Mary Magdalene used the Grail to catch a spiritual substance, Christ’s transformed blood and water, as it flowed from his wounded side upon the Cross. 8 The combination of these same two events, the Last Supper and the Crucifixion, hold the esoteric secrets of the Grail and form the basis of the Christian Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 326 From these statements we can be certain that the Grail substance, H , enabled one to alter their blood and expand consciousness. When we acquire our H we will perceive a new reality and hence see or have the power to create a new Heaven and a new Earth. We will peruse the crystal halls of the New Jerusalem, the royal court of Jesus Christ or Krist. In John 10:19 Jesus said: \u0001 “I am the door. If anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.” This is the powerful reward the ancient prophets said we would receive during the time of destiny.

The H may be far more universal and have more to do with the development of the H-bomb than is realized. The ‘Golden Age of Physics’ which led to the development of the H-bomb began in Germany in 1900 with Max Planck’s discovery relating to energy and radiation. His discovery enabled a stunning new picture of realty, a New World order of science, to emerge. It was based on nonmateriality. Planck, who laid the foundation for quantum theory, together with Albert Einstein, the most"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 327 famous scientist of all human history, masterminded the shift in human perspective from the macro world of the visible cosmos to the invisible microcosmos of the atom. In 1900 Planck solved a persistent radiation problem in mechanical physics, that of the ultraviolet catastrophe . Imagine the universe is a black box (or a transparent cube in the blackness of space) with walls that completely absorb all light (souls) which strikes them equally no matter the color or frequency of the light, and that these walls reemit this energy in an equally “democratic” fashion. Now, make a pinhole (wormhole) in the universe (out of the Cube of Space). Any light (soul) bouncing off any of the walls must bounce around quite a bit (reincarnate in many human bodies) before it finds the pinhole (stargate, wormhole to Heaven). Any light that was not absorbed by one wall would be scattered in diffuse reflections and would be absorbed by other walls (the soul is enmeshed in the matrix of Earth life). Each time the light bounced off the walls a small fraction of the light would remain there leaving a smaller fraction to seek the pinhole. Physicists theorized that if the walls of the black box were kept at a certain temperature (or frequency), one would expect that the light or radiation that finds the pinhole had first settled into “thermal equilibrium“ with t he walls of the black box before it escaped. The resultant spectrum is called a “black body” spectrum. The hole, itself, would act as a perfect absorber of the light, and would therefore represent a black body (a black hole). Physicists theorized that if the temperature in the black bo x were raised to a certain temperature and held there, then the"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 328 radiation that escaped from the pinhole is black body radiation and its frequency could be studied. In 1895 a German physicist, Wilhelm Wien (a Nobel laureate), made those studies. Contrary to what physicists theorized, he observed that at a given temperature, the energy radiated at given frequencies behaved in a peculiar manner. It increased as the frequency was raised, reached a peak, and then began to decrease as the frequency was increased. When Wien raised the temperature, he discovered that more energy was radiated at every frequency, and that a new peak was reached. This new peak was at a higher frequency level than the first peak. At this point a paradox arose. Max Planck spent three years pursuing this paradox. In 1900 he presented his radiation formula. He solved the problem by proposing that the vibrating particles can only radiate at certain energies. These energies would be determined by a new number a “universal constant“ which Planck called... h . “Since it had the dimension of action (energy x time),” wrote Planck, “I gave it the name elementary quantum of action .” 9 Q u a n t u m is from the Latin word q u a n t u s , meaning ‘how much?, how many?’ since the size of the quanta was the main question.

As with the cat atop the head of the Cretan goddess, the cat symbolizes a purr , i.e. a frequency or vibration of thought that enables one to ‘split the wood’ or Word. The word is a-tom. When one achieves Grail consciousness they are capable of splitting the a-tom for military purposes. As all cat lovers know, the cat’s purr has a healing quality. Thus, we may speculate that the secrets of splitting the a-tom can also be used for spiritual healing. The Language of the Birds further reveals the spiritual significance of the cat. The word ka is used to denote the cat. Like the divine Ka, the cat is the one who lies in what, and whose sharp eyes can see in the dark with its own internal beam of light. Hence, the black cat is the symbol for the hidden Ka, our divine self that knows the secrets of creation, and can harness the sacred rays of light. My research has led me to hypothesize that Solomon embedded the secrets of splitting the a-tom -- the secret of a transcendental light -- in his famed Temple. The Templar recovered it and shared this pearl with the Cat-hars, the Pure or Purr Ones. Universal h became known as Planck’s constant . This universal constant ( h ) gives the ratio of a quantum of radiant energy ( E ) to the frequency ( v ) of its source: it is expressed by the equation E=hv and its approximate numerical value is 6.625 x 10-27 erg seconds.

It represented a dividing line"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 331 between the ancient classical and mechanistic world and the modern nonmaterial world of quantum. With his discovery Planck built a bridge to the modern world, having the same effect, as did the H in the ancient world where Abraham, who was brought from the other side of the flood, represented a link between the pre-flood world and the post-flood world. In 1905 Einstein connected Planck’s h and his idea of the strange, discontinuous energy levels to another puzzle whose solution had evaded physicists for decades: the photoelectric effect . Beginning in the 1880’s physicists had noticed that some metals behaved as though they were giving off electricity under the influence of light. At the same time they discovered that electricity was associated with the movement of subatomic particles called electrons and that when light was shown on these metals it knocked electrons free. This is the photoelectric effect. It is appl ied today in the solar panels that power spacecraft. In 1905 Albert Einstein noticed that the energy of the electrons ejected from the metal surfaces did not depend, as the mechanistic model would suggest, on the brightness of the light. Rather it depended on a more emotional variable - - the color of the light, its tone or its frequency . What Einstein proposed as a result of this observation was nothing short of scientific heresy. He proposed that light not only radiated in quanta, as Planck theorized, but that it was absorbed in quanta as well. Einstein’s theory flew in the face of hundreds of years of scientific observation that demonstrated that light only traveled in waves."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 332 He saw light as travelling in small, individual packets that seemed to be analogous to an “atom of energy” or a “particle of energy.” Light, said Einstein, consists of particles that were eventually called photons (from the Greek for “light”). Einstein’s strange conclusion shocked the physics world when he presented them in 1905. How can an electron or an object be a particle and a wave at the same time? Einstein’s observation of the dual characteristic of matter was of incredible cosmic and practical human significance. Einstein’s paper established the theoretical basis for the photoelectric cell, or “electric eye.” This device made possible sound motion pictures, television, and many other inventions. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics for this paper on quanta. In a second paper, titled “The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” Einstein presented the special theory of relativity. In this paper, he showed how the theory demonstrated the relativity of time, a previously unimaginable idea. It also led to the further understanding of black holes. In 1905, Einstein proposed his special theory of relativity. From this theory comes the idea that mass and energy are interchangeable and are related by the equation E equals m times c-squared. In this equation, E stands for energy, m for mass, and c-squared for the speed of light multiplied by itself.

One of the applications of Planck’s constant emphasizes the connection between the H of the Grail story and modern physics. In his book The God Particle , Nobel laureate Leon Lederman tells of the enormous angst quantum physicists have suffered over the number 137. “One hundred thirty-seven,” he says, “is the inverse of something called the fine-structure constant.

It is arrived at by taking the square of the charge of an electron divided by the speed of light times h , Planck’s constant.

Lederman notes that Werner Heisenberg once declared himself the protagonist of the position that all the questio ns of quantum mechanics would disappear when 137 was finally explained. 13 Wolfgang Pauli, he says, was so tormented by the mystery of 137 that it bordered on obsession. Why is alpha equal to 1/137? The solution to this mystery eluded him. Synchronistically, 137 was the hospital room number in which Pauli spent his last remaining earthly hours contemplating this mystery. As I have noted, Wolfgang Pauli’s dreams were loaded with alchemical and Grail imagery. Speculative though this may be, it is my contention that he was closer to Grail consciousness than he may have realized. Let me explain why. The essence of the experimental method is the ability to make predictions based upon the existing data.

His computer analysis of Genesis 1:1 revealed regular patterns of numbers and geometry which were so far beyond coincidence that Jenkins claimed they proved the presence of a Divine mind in the authorship of Genesis. The number 37 had a disproportionately high rate of incidence throughout the verse: “In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.” In addition, c h o k m a h , the Hebrew word used throughout the Old Testament for wisdom totals 37. 37 and its compliment in Gematria, 137, is the number of wisdom. What has all this got to do with the Holy Grail? Gematrists Bligh Bond and Simcox Lea, two British researchers who extensively researched the number relationships of the Grail mystery, point out that the number 37 can be seen figuratively as a cube . 15 Their interpretation was confirmed by early Gnostic writings dating to 100 AD.

It is the brilliant white crown where contact with the Higher Self or the eternal Ka occurs. As Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan notes, the Hebrew word for “eternal” is Kedem, which usually indicates keter . 19 The Hebrew word for Crown, Keter, also comes from the root Katar , meaning to “surround.” It is through the attribute of Keter or Kedem (eternity) that God encompasses all space and time. I find the interchange between the words Kether and Cathar most intriguing. It suggests to me that if one wishes to experience God, they must achieve the crown of the Cathar, or Cat. That is, they must attune their brainwaves to God. On the inside of these brainwaves is the Tree of Life, symbolized by the H . Unless the symbolism of the H is fully understood, the symbolism of the number 37 sails beyond our grasp for meaning. With it, it seems probable beyond a shadow of doubt that the answer that the answer to the riddle of 137 Heisenberg was seeking is Jesus H. Christ.

A possible clue as to the effect of the ‘blood of Christ’ on the body may be concealed in the word luciferen ; a substance in the blood of fireflies, some sea mollusks, etc., that combines with an enzyme in their bodies to produce light. 1 In occult terminology, as humans we have this “fire essence” in our nerve cells. The nerve cell is composed of two layers of tissue, white and grey . The white constitutes the nerve proper and the grey the ganglion. The latter contains the nucleated nerves that are centered in a protoplasmic substance containing phosphorus .

The fire or wisdom that emanates from the Healing Sun is also called the water or wisdom of life. Ice is frozen water. When the pressure of fire meets water crystal is formed. Occultists believe fire and i c e represent the two polarities within. The Cathars believed man re-enters the kingdom of God (Amor/Tula) through his soul.

Those who dwell in this ‘wholly new’, ‘holey new’, or shall we say ‘holy new’, unprecedented world know it as Camelot in the Grail romances and the New Jerusalem in the book of Revelation.

I said ye are Gods.” 9 This substance -- the transmuted elements, caught by the Holy Grail -- took humans across"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 345 the baptismal waters of life, through the crystal halls of Christ’s Court in the Land of Amor. The difference between Catharism and Catholicism is that to the Cathars the way across to the pure Land of Amor was not provided by the death of Christ or belief in his resurrection. It was through the elements of the Eucharist transubstantiated into the blood of Christ that was created within them . This act transforms the human into a superhuman, or a Pure One. To me, this is the kink in both the Nazi Master Aryan race theory and the ‘bloodline of Jesus’ theory, the proposal that Jesus and Mary Magdalene wed and had children. Both theories are elitist. They uphold the notion that either a race, or a single individual, is somehow better than all others are. In The Lost Language of Symbolism Symbolist Harold Bayley tells how the surviving Cathars concealed the secrets of the Gospel of Love in watermarks that were embedded in the paper they manufactured. 10 Bayley documented this symbol system. One of their first emblems was a pair of holy glasses. Another was a cluster of grapes. Among other purposes this symbol enabled the Cathars to recognize one another. In addition, they revealed the first and last wonders of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth: we are all One. From this statement I concluded that the Grail teaching is trans-race and trans-religion. It works regardless of th e faith or belief of the practitioner. The Grail substance secreted from within enabled all -- regardless of race or religion -- to achieve the ‘blood of Christ’ and to link with their highest, purest self. I feel that Otto Rahn may have shared this viewpoint as well. When he proposed"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 346 dispensing with the Nazi Master Race nonsense and using this knowledge to benefit all of humanity the Nazis killed him. There is ample evidence in Grail tradition to support my theory concerning this substance. According to Grail historian Andrew Sinclair, in the French History of the Grail the cup, dish or platter used to collect the transformed Blood of Christ on the Cross was called the e s c u e l e (pronounced ‘s kool ’, ‘s kiel ’ or ‘s kill ’). 11 The Grail heresy further states that, after the Crucifixion, a few drops of the blood of life (called soma or SaBa ) spilled out of Jesus’ body while Joseph tended his wounds. Joseph and Nicodemus collected these drops in the escuele and took them to Glastonbury Tor in England. Then began to unfold the history of the exploits of the Knights of the Round Table, which space does not permit us to explore. The Round Table, says Rene Guenon, was destined to receive the Grail when one of the Knights should have succeeded in winning it and bringing it from Britain to Armorica . 12 This place name is presumed to refer to lower Britanny. However, I have given reason to speculate that it actually refers to America . The circular form of the Round Table is believed to relate to the ‘zodiacal cycle’ by the presence around it of twelve symbols. Of additional interest is the apocryphal tradition of Jesus’ Round Dance. Found in the Acts of John , this is a ritual dance that takes place in the Garden after the Last Supper. This Garden has twelve gates or halls. Each of the twelve disciples dances in a circle around Jesus, the Lord of the Dance, who sings a cosmic song."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 347 The Round Dance is a preparatory initiation. It prepares the disciples for the Crucifixion at Golgotha, the Skull. I have discussed the interplay between the words Skill and Skull and its implications on the esoteric significance of the Crucifixion elsewhere. Here it suffices to say that in metaphysical terms at this event Jesus lifted the vibration or song of the Divine Heart-Center, the galactic core or Central Healing Sun, so as to make its healing energy and wisdom (skill) available to all. Ringing from the center of Christ’ Court, the keynote of the planet shifts and it becomes attuned to the song of the Core. It may also attune us to the Thought Sphere. The Hebrew word ShKL KLLI means the Collective Intelligence. ShKL PLA means “Wonderful Intelligence.” 13 Access to this divine knowledge is granted to those with the Crystal Skull. If Skill is the actual Name or title of Christos, it makes perfect sense why the escuele (skill) receptacle in which Joseph collected the Holy Blood was so named. It too referred to its owner. This is akin to a doctor labeling a vial containing a blood sample with a patient’s name. The vial containing the blood of the patient shares the name of the patient because they are the same. This word fossil, escuele or Skill, resurfaced in Britain as a name for the Blessed Isles or Skilly Isles (pronounced Silly Isles), the surviving islands of Atlantis in British lore. Atlantis was also known as Ultima Thule . This is the same name as the Druid homeland, suggesting the Druids may have carried the seed name Skilly to England and planted it in the ground there. ShKL KLLI may be reduced to ShKLLI or Skilli."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 348 In Godseed: The Journey of Christ , 14 Dr. Jean Houston presents what I consider a major revelation when she notes that Christos and Chrestos were interchangeable terms to the early Christians. Chrestos, she says, means simpleton, great silly or blessed one . She says that, in one of the apocryphal traditions, Pontius Pilate is supposed to have said to Jesus upon the Pillar, “Ain Chrestos!” or “You are the great silly.” 15 When the interchangeability between silly and skilly, both words mean “blessed,” is taken into account, might Pilate have meant to say, “You are the great Chrestos or Skilly?” Did this mean “You are the great Blessed One!? Or Skilled One?” In the view of Dead Sea Scroll scholar Dr. John Allegro, Chrestos refers to a hallucinogenic substance. 16 My search has shown it was an essence that emerged from the galactic core that rises from within. Paul affirms this noti on that Jesus is the incarnation of the divine skill or wisdom when he says, “he is the power and the wisdom (Skill) of God.” 17 The bottom line is the word Skill suggests God’s greatest secrets, the substance of Heaven, is not hidden in a particular human’s body or skull (even though the alleged decapitated head of Jesus has been traced for centuries). The holographic key of life theory states that the secrets of the burst of light from the Core, which is the Grail and Holy Spirit itself, are buried deep in our cranium (skull). I f we can learn the code of the Healing Sun we can access the hidden Family Secrets of Jesus and the Crucifixion and produce the Blood of Life within ourselves.

In doing so we discover that the skill, wisdom, ecstasy, and mystery of Christ is available to all that lift or secrete the hidden and forbidden substance within their own blood. Plainly stated, the cryst al halls of Christ’s Court are in our own blood. According to Barbara Walker, a common Semitic metaphor for enlightened seers was “salt of the Earth.” 18 Salt referred to the Mother’s regenerative blood. The term “salt of the Earth” was applied to Christ’s followers. 19 It infers that they are the “finest,” “highest,” and “noblest” (Aryan) of humans. This suggests they had knowledge of the crystalline structure of salt and something in their blood. THE H-SIENS Many Gnostic Christian scholars believe that Jesus drew wisdom from the ancient wisdom wells of Egypt, India and Sumeria. We may add China to this list. In 202 BC to AD 9 (roughly the time of Jesus) during the Han dynasty of China a mini-renaissance unfolded. A new type of water clock that could measure time continuously instead of short, defined periods triggered t his cultural blossoming. This invention, combined with new astronomical technologies, expanded the mind of the Chinese. During this time adepts in the Chinese Taoist tradition attempted to achieve the state of H-Sien : material immortality. The Chinese ‘Tao’ (pronounced “ dow” ) is phonetically the same as the Hebrew letter Tau , or T, and the Greek word Tau , the Cross of Life. Tao means ‘Way’,"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 350 an appellation ascribed to Jesus, and the Essenes, ‘those of the Way’. In fact, Jesus (or IHS) shares several thought- provoking correspondences with the H-Siens (pronounced “ ach-ess-ee-enns” ). Jesus was considered the King of Sion. Phonetically, Sion and Sien are close enough to match. In the Language of the Birds they are, therefore, interchangeable. Without the vowels, Sion and Sien both become ‘sn’. Phonetically, ‘sn’ ( ess-n ) is exactly the same as Essene (pronounced ‘ess- n’), Jesus’ sect. These correspondences suggest H-Sien and Jesus H. Christ’s-Sion are linguistic equations for the same state or place. In another extraordinary correspondence, the artists of the Han dynasty depicted the state of H-Sien as a feathered man, 1 indicating his ability to soar in the heavenly world. Jesus was symbolized by the phoenix, the bird of resurrection, making him a symbolic birdman. The H - Sien’s artwork, which encodes the process by which immortality is achieved typically feature, hares working under a fig tree pounding herbs in a mortar for the medicine of immortality. 20 A rabbit or hare symbolizes Easter, the Christian celebration of Jesus’ resurrection. The H-Siens alchemists achieved the Way by drinking the hare’s alchemical elixirs and partaking in a procedure called heliotherapy . Baring their naked bodies to the sun the Chinese men held a special character -- the sun within an enclosure -- in their hand. This symbol connected or fused them with the light of the sun. Correspondingly, the word crucifixion comes from crux or crucis , a cross, and figere , to fasten. 21 Not only was the Son, Jesus, fastened or connected to a pillar, but also the"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 351 process of Crucifixion fastened, fused or connected him to a higher source of Light. This is symbolized in Christian art by a halo of sunlight around his head. On yet a deeper level of understanding that corresponds directly with the Grail, the letter H (pronounced ach ) of the Hebrews has been corrupted into CH , in both ancient and modern times, says linguist Godfrey Higgins. 22 Hrs was the solar fire , and like the sun it meant also machinator , which means the material light or plastic formative power . 23 Combining CH and Hrs in CHRST or CHRIST would therefore render this term “machinator or fashioner of light.” Abraham, Sarah, the H - S i e n s and Jesus were all physically transformed as a result of acquiring their H’s . The latter two became shining birdmen. Does this suggest some form of genetic alteration that triggered a shift from human to Homo Christos that enabled them to scale the ancient H or 8 ladder to Heaven? The importance of the blood and salt is emphasized as the interaction between Abraham and the Lord continues. The Lord informs Abraham of the patriarch’s impending paternity. 24 As Abraham is “without seed,” and therefore physically incapable of fathering a child, this is no small task. Still, the Lord maintains Abraham and Sarah will bear a child. Not just any child will be born to Abraham. The Lord guarantees the couple will be blessed with a son. Overhearing this patently absurd statement, Sarah, who is barren, laughs out loud. The Lord is put off. He promises to return in the Spring when Sarah will have a son. \u0001"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 352 “ The Lord said to Abraham, ‘Why did Sarah laugh, and say, “Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’ Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, in the spring, and Sara shall have a son.‘ But Sara denied, saying. ‘I did not laugh‘; for shewas afraid. He said, ‘No, but you did laugh’ 25 \u0001 At the same time he is creating this miracle for Abraham and Sarah, the Lord now suddenly takes on a sinister personality. The change in story is dramatic. He dispatches the two angels who accompanied him to visit Abraham’s nephew, Lot, in neighboring Sodom and Gomorrah. Within days, the citizens of these twin cities would suffer a holocaust, their existence all but erased fro m human memory, by a premeditated and preventable thunderbolt from the sky of atomic proportions. In a scene reminiscent of the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, at dawn one morning, as Abraham looked upon the valley below, fire came down from “the Lord out of heaven.” 26 “The smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace” 23 Sodom and Gomorrah were gone. As Jesus said, “By their fruits ye shall know them.” The following spring when Sarah had the child promised by the Lord she named him Isaac, “He laughs” or “God laughs.” The reason for the dual meanings of this name can be interpreted in a multiplicity of ways. From one perspective it could be a political statement. The violent and manipulative God forced his breath on this child and on Sarah against her wishes. Ha! Is this the patriarchy’s way"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 353 of saying that the male God has final say so -- or the last laugh -- when it comes to what goes on inside a woman’s body? Another way of interpreting Isaac, “he laughs,” is that he was a silly child or a Skilly child. As a result of the blast from the Lord that caused the destruction of Sodom, Lot’s wife turned to a pillar of salt. Generations after generation have been told that the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah were wicked fornicators who disobeyed the Lord and given the warning about what happen if they too disobey God. But have we heard the whole story here? When we look up the word saltation in the dictionary it means a sudden genetic mutation . 27 The symbol for genetics is the double helix, the figure 8. This symbol existed thousands of years ago where it was known as the caduceus rod with two serpents wrapped around a central rod. It symbolized the healing of the soul. It was not until the 20th century with the invention of modern microbiology and genetics that it was realized the caduceus symbol bears a striking resemblance to the double helix of DNA, whose twisting strands dance in the form of a perpetual 8. Yet looking back on all that it represented, the secrets of the blood of life, the entwined serpents of the 8 or H ladder symbolized a genetic teaching of personal transformation or alchemy which enables a leap from an ordinary human being (Sara) into a higher being, Homo Christos (Sarah). How is this possible? The ancients, we are told, did not possess knowledge of the double helix. Or did they? Did H - wielding salvation scientists, such as Melchizedek, Jesus and the H-Siens , possess the secrets of transmuting DNA? The story of Abraham and Sarah holds a deep secret –"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 354 the secret of H and the secret of salt crystals. On a spiritual level, this knowledge can be used to create a noble race of humans and a spiritual substance. On the material level, they can be used for military purposes. Powermongers of all ages have sought these secrets. This is why to alchemists crystalline salt is the ultimate reality. Symbolized by the Seal of Solomon or Sal Amon and its two triangles representing Fire and Water in balance salt holds the key to all evolution. It is the symbol of the juncture between being and becoming, human and God. Schwaller de Lubicz makes a fascinating note concerning salt. 28 He tells the story that when he worked in Paris just before WW I, when he was first in touch with “Fulcanelli” and his alchemical activity was underway, tha t he began noticing that all the good passages in the old books at the Biblioteque Nationale and in public libraries all through the country were systematically being cut out. By good passages he meant those that pertained to salt. It turned out to be the Jesuits (not surprisingly, he says). He said they were more dangerous than even big governments. And, says de Lubicz, it is well known that both the US and Russian governments were running experiments in alchemy. One of the fundamental beliefs of the Aquarian Age is the idea that Christ’s Second Coming is an infusion of Christ Consciousness. This is often described as a ‘fire, frequency or vibration’ that is now downpouring on the Earth. This ‘Christ Substance’ or ‘water’, called INRI, wil l be transmuted into ‘wine’ our blood. As a cosmic event the Baptism of Christ involves the drawing together, fusion, and release into the Earthly plan e"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 355 of celestial and underworld forces. Fire and water symbolize these forces respectively. Fire represents the power of the Holy Spirit. Water represents the Earth. Together, they form crystal. There is a fascinating tradition cited by Cyril of Jerusalem in the fourth century that the river Jordan issued forth from the mouth of a dragon. Readers of my book The Healing Sun Code will readily interpret this dragon as a symbol for a (star)gateway or wormhole linking Heaven and Earth and the transference of healing energies from the core of our Milky Way. The resulting baptism of the Earth in the energies of the Core transforms the individual, as well as the planet. It uplifts the Earth’s spiritual vibration bringing it closer to Heaven. The source of these cleansing waters is the center of our Milky Way galaxy, which the ancients called Thule or Tula. As noted, the center of our galaxy is symbolized by the enclosed sun cross or Cross of Light . In Christian lore, after Jesus’ baptism the heavenly energies enveloped the entire Earth, following the channels of the four rivers that flow from the Earthly center (Jerusalem) and “carried back into paradise things far more precious than those which came out.” 29 From the foregoing we can see the clear difference in thinking that separated the Church of Amor from the Church of Roma. To the Cathars the baptism referred to the inundation of cosmic waters not immersion in earthly water."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"THE CRYSTAL HALLS OF CHRIST’S COURT 356 If we treat the human body as a conglomerate of liquid crystals we begin to see how the introduction of cosmic Christ rays can bring about the next level of creation.

Salt that has just crystallized out of solution gives us an archetypal picture of how the skeleton is formed. The human skeleton “crystallizes” in the fluid embryo in the same way that salt cubes take shape in the mother solution....The forces at work here are densifying, shaping ones. 30 Through the reception of the Chrestos or Quintessence , the Christ Substance, the blood of the initiate will ultimately become liguid light.
