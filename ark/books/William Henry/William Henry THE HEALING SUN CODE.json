At 26 Jansky was only a few years beyond his physics degree from the University of Wisconsin. Jansky came to AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey specifically to study noise. Reducing the static that infested the airwaves on trans-Atlantic telephone calls was vital to this budding new age that soon would enable anyone, anywhere on Earth to pick up a cell phone and talk to another. Jansky boldly set about solving this problem. To find the source of this pesky noise he built the first 95 foot movable radio telescope to detect it. 1 This large rod-like antenna, which resembled a box kite lying on its side, swiveled on a circular track supported by Ford Model-T tires. Built beside a stream in a remote field in Holmdel Township New Jersey far from city-made electrical interference, it became Jansky’s second home. He began listening and taking notes. While two clear immediate suspects were local and distant thunderstorms, a third was a steady hiss of unknown origin that appeared daily at the same time and same location."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 2 Karl Jansky points at a star map. Noise always increased when Jansky pointed his rod at the stars. By using a star map, he discovered that the waves came from the center of our Milky Way Galaxy at 26 degrees of Sagittarius. What lurks at the center of our galaxy that produced the hiss that caught Jansky’s ear? From the vantage point of some 23 thousand light years away it is difficult to determine. A cloud of dust obscures the Core, making it invisible to the human eye and even to optical telescopes. But not to Jansky’s radio telescope."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 3 He had discovered a new age tool -- a rod that could penetrate space, dust, and planetary clouds -- with which astronomers could probe the mysteries of space. His discovery, which was not publicly discussed until a 1933 page-one article in the New York Times initiated the science of radio astronomy. Even though Jansky performed some follow-up studies on the extraterrestrial radio waves for several years -- mostly in his spare time -- he largely abandoned those efforts to pursue wartime research. Years later, other scientists continued developing the field of radio astronomy, which has led to such wondrous discoveries as quasars, pulsars, black holes and the expanding universe. One might think that the discovery of a heavenly noise, albeit a hiss, would yield a Nobel Prize to Jansky. However, when the Bell Labs scientist died in 1950 at the young age of 44, he had received no formal recognition from the scientific community. His notebooks, including data on the exact location where his antenna made the historic contact with the Galactic Core, were lost for decades until a summer student majoring in archaeology found an old box of Jansky’s papers at Bell Labs’ former facility in New York City. 2 Since the 1960’s, astronomers have followed Jansky’s lead and have tuned in to the galaxy’s hiss. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on ever-more-ambitious devices for doing so. For example, the magnificent radio telescope built in 1963 in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, stretches 1,000 feet across a small valley. During the early 1960’s astronomers began to realize that the massive object that forms the core of our Milky Way Galaxy periodically becomes active. 3 The cores of all spiral galaxies cycle through a similar phase. During its active period, our galactic core is a cauldron of chaos. It spews out fierce quasar-like barrages of cosmic rays, with"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 4 a total energy output equal to hundreds of thousands of supernova explosions. 4 In 1965 A.A. Penzias and R.W. Wilson were conducting radio astronomy experiments with the ultra- sensitive horn antenna at Crawford Hill, New Jersey but were frustrated by a noise in its receiving system, a background noise that remained constant no matter which direction they scanned. This made no sense and they suspected that it came from bird droppings on the antenna, but after a careful cleaning the noise remained. They then realized that the noise corresponded exactly with the “background radiation” posited by cosmologists who favored the Big Bang theory of creation. Penzias and Wilson had discovered the “afterglow” of the cosmic Big Bang. They had heard the Echo of Creation, and were awarded a Nobel Prize for their discovery. Today radio astronomers monitor the activity of the Galactic Core on a daily basis. They also study explosions from the cores of neighboring galaxies. According to Dr. Paul LaViolette, whose astounding Galactic Core vision is simultaneously mind-expanding and pulse-quickening, 5, 6, 7 Galactic Core outbursts are the most energetic phenomenon taking place in the universe. 8 The active, quasar-like core of spiral galaxy PG 0052+251, for example, is seen to radiate 7 times as much energy as comes from all of the galaxy’s stars. Most of this is emitted in the form of high energy cosmic ray electrons accompanied by electromagnetic radiation ranging from radio wave frequencies on up to X ray and gamma ray frequencies. LaViolette warns these explosions may have spelled immense trouble for past civilizations, and may, one day, spell trouble again. However, as with most of nature, there is another side to this story..."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 5 When Karl Jansky discovered that the Galactic Core ‘hissed’ he was affirming a belief long held by ancient mystics and shamans that our galaxy was an egg surrounded by a serpent. This egg has a heart, a Central Sun that beats and sends divine vibrations that spread through the galaxy. In other words it hisses. In a league of their own apart from the X-ray and gamma ray radiations, these cosmic vibrations were considered to be a tremendous source of vital spiritual energy that could heal the body and soul and bring immortality. The Central Sun or Spiritual Sun, said these medicine people, is, in fact, the Healing Sun. By the sick, mystics have always understood ignorance and moral and mental sickness. Who is a healthy person? The wise person, who turns away from iniquity, out of darkness and into the light of health . It is the Healing Sun that brings the light of wisdom , and wisdom brings a healthy body, mind and spirit. Truly, says the writer of Ecclesiastes, the biblical ‘book of man under the Sun’, “the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun.” 9 It “makes the face shine.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 6 For millennia seekers have sought the means to ‘tune’ the human body and earthly civilization to the mystical wisdom, force or energy of the hidden Healing Sun. The implications of Jansky’s discovery were revolutionary for this reason. It marked the beginning of modern humanity’s awareness of the mysterious double-edged energies emanating from the Galactic Core. In this way Jansky’s discovery helped connect us to a long-hidden place and time. If prophets are correct, it helped connect us to a vital source of healing that can transport humanity one level up on the spiral of evolution. To mystics, this cauldron of chaos is a cornucopia or horn of plenty that contains the ingredients of life and the secrets of when time began. Like King Arthur pulling the sword Excalibur from the stone, our ability to wield these energies will represent our unity with the forces of creation. The existence of the Healing Sun has been coded in the Mystery Teachings which tradition has so long held to lie behind the Holy Scriptures of numerous religions. This book will throw light on these Mystery Teachings, the secret science and religion of the Galactic Core, by revealing the symbol and word code of the Healing Sun. It is by no means intended to be a complete initiation into these Mystery Teachings. However, it will provide the seeker with several instrumental tools for shedding additional light on the innermost secrets of the original science/religion and decoding them themselves. Treated as a guided primer of the Mystery of the Healing Sun encoded in science and religion, this book will help put us in touch with our own inner Healing Sun that heals, teaches and strives to perfect us. Then we can enter the “Kingdom of Heaven,” which is at the core of all religions."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 7 1. THE COSMIC EGG Every culture has a myth dealing with the creation of our galaxy. Since the Paleolithic times the beginning of life and the spreading of the vibrations from the Galactic Core has been described as the hatching of a Cosmic Egg laid by a Great Mother bird. A germ shown as a dot • resided in the midst of this egg. 1 The Cosmic Egg is a female symbol for the universal womb or matrix of space-time. When this egg cracked open all life appeared. Cosmic energy or essence ~, the seed from which all life, including human, sprang into existence and fanned out in waves. The Egg is enveloped by water, symbolized in Paleolithic art by wavy lines ~ ~. 2 As we visit the many myths of the Cosmic Egg, we will notice that inter-twined with this concept of the genesis of the universe from an elemental aqua-substance held inside a Cosmic Egg is the code symbol of the tree and life energy in the form of a serpent . In Druid lore the Cosmic Egg was called the ‘egg of the serpent’. Perhaps, as I said, this was because, like a serpent, the Core of our galaxy ‘hisses’. The beginning of life within the Cosmic Egg, it was believed, is caused by the orbiting of twin snakes that are in cooperative opposition with one another. Along with the egg the caduceus is a central symbol of the Healing Sun code."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 8 Cosmic egg and cosmic snake motifs are featured on these vase designs from Western Ukraine, c. 4500 BC.

One of the most elegant interpretations of the splitting of the Cosmic Egg by two converging snakes comes from the civilization of Minoan Crete.

The myths and scripture of many peoples say that not only cosmic essence, healing wisdom, rays or “waters,” but also our souls originated from a pure place of convergence at the Galactic Center, the • at the center of the Egg.

Its light dispels the darkness. Acknowledgement of this material is crystal clear in the Cretan shrine and in its twin, the Aztec shrine shown here. It suggests that the ancients had knowledge of our DNA. This knowledge was widespread. The idea that ours souls came from a Cosmic Egg is shared by the Celts, Greeks, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Canaanites, Tibetans, Hindus, Vietnamese, Chinese, Russians, Central Americans and Indonesians. 3 The ubiquity of this concept suggest to me that this was a self- evident Truth or that someone had given this code symbol"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 13 to these varied peoples through some form of revelation, perhaps by some form of ethereal spirit or wandering missionary or missionaries. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras ( c. 500 BC) taught that our souls dwell in the Milky Way between incarnations, 4 inferring that when we incarnate on Earth we each bring a ray of the Healing Sun with us. Many traditions regard the Milky Way as the pathway, built by the gods, which souls follow to the Otherworld. 5 At the end of this path lies the land of the dead, which is viewed as a return to Greater Life from the soul’s perspective. Our Milky Way is spiral in form similar to many other spiral-shaped galaxies, including Galaxy M81 and M82 (below), which is about 10 million light-years away from Earth. M82 is distinguished by an outpouring of incandescent gas from the area around its core. Galaxy M81 and M82.

A similar Chinese ideogram means return or homecoming . 9 The Tibetans painted the thread on the walls of their homes and gave it the meaning home , 10 the place one returns to. To the Mayans G or ge also represented zero (O), an egg . 11 When the G appears on the walls of Mayan temples, pyramids, sculptures, or in their codices, says Men, it is a code symbol for the secret Mysteries of the science and religion of the Milky Way, 12 the Cosmic Egg. This is the place our soul’s came from, and return to, according to a widely held cross -cultural belief. From a symbolic point of view, the vertical oval or egg is a combination of the elements and . 13 As it is a modern scientific symbol meaning galaxy . 14 It is easy to see why this is so when we compare with the photo of galaxy M82 on page 13. The Maya believed that the elemental universal essence from the Cosmic Egg represented by ~ or the sacred symbol G rises within us. 15 They were aware that we are seeds, elements, of an original tree, or eggs of an Egg. We are made of elemental galactic material, or ‘star stuff’. It is worth taking a moment to crack open the word elemental. El-e-mental means ‘mind’ ( mental ) of ( El ), Hebrew for ‘God’, is e (‘E = mc 2 ’). This Humpty Dumpty of a hint tells us that the El-e-mental substance of which we are made is intelligent light. This means the whole of the “secret” code of the Core is crystallized within us too waiting to grow like a seed becoming a tree. As the nursery rhyme says, it will take"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 17 more than all the king’s horses and men to get this job done. It will take the energy of the Queen who laid Humpty Dumpty. The Mayan name for the Mother of the ~ was the “Heart of the Sky”. 16 Their original homeland, they said, was called Tollan or Tula . 17 Its alternate name Aztlan was called ‘the place of herons’by the Aztecs. 18 Across the world, the Greeks called the Druid (‘Skilled Ones’) mecca for wisdom and learning at the center of heaven Tula . 19 Mixing these linguistic and mythological threads together gives rise to the notion that Tula is a common ancient name of the Galactic Core and the Healing Sun. While the idea of mixing Mayan and Druid culture together on the basis of one word, Tula, may seem bird- brained to some, such mixing is an “art” that expands into a general code of symbolism and words: the Healing Sun code. In order to decode more of the symbols of the ‘place of herons’, and the secret science and religion which formed around it, we will draw on all languages and symbol systems that refer to it. We will make connections between religions and cultures that seem incredible when we make them. So incredibly powerful are they, however, that they remind us that we are united in the Circle, O, or Cosmic Egg of Life. The Healing Sun code draws upon the Language of the Birds; the initiatory language code of mythology that unites seemingly unrelated subjects by their linguistic and phonetic similarity. In the Language of the Birds concepts are matched by the phonetic similarity of the words used to symbolize them in English . Like the song of a bird (and jazz music), at first these linkages start out sounding off key. But then, they come around to the key. Reggie Wooten, a friend and world-renowned jazz guitar player,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 18 observes that the song of a bird seldom makes a direct statement. Rather, it asks a question. For example, how do we explain the presence of the bird word Tula in diverse cultures with different languages who never had any contact? The same way we explain the presence and shared sacredness of the Mayan G or ge among many other people. They came from the same original code. Language is fossil poetry. If we dig deep enough into word meanings we discover the original meaning of a word or object, and the original language spoken by humanity. With this language comes understanding of the original science/religion of the ancients, referred to in the Bible as the Ur (‘light’) science and religion. It is the science/religion of the Healing Sun. In discovering the secrets of the Core and its ~, the poet, whose mind is free to roam the figurative domain, may be more fortunate than the radio astronomer. However, a radio astronomer who is also a poet would find sheer poetry by tracing the meaning of Gen or G , the Galaxy. For example, “ gen” means ‘love’ in China. Webster’s defines gen as “to be born, to become.” 20 Saint Genevieve ( Gen Eve ), “the Generator of Life,” is the patron of Paris. The words gentle, genuine, genetics, germinate, gestate, geology, geography all share the ge root, along with general, the whole O. Ge is also the mirror image of eg or egg . The bottom line is, as elements of the poetic, right- brained Healing Sun code, the bird word Tula, the egg and G symbols are interchangeable: Tula = = G . G = Love. This piece of code sheds light on the Hebrew tradition that the most Holy One created the whole world like an embryo. As the embryo grows ( Ge -rows) from the navel , so G- od began to create the world by the navel, and from there it spread in all directions. 21"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 19 The navel (Latin umbilicus ) is the center ( Tula ). When Moses ascended Mount Sinai, he did so to speak with a God whose name was unspeakable, but was called Jehova, or Ge-hova in the code . Je means ‘I’ in French. Ova means ‘egg’ in Latin. Amalgamated, Jehova or Gehova therefore means ‘I, Milky Way ( G ) Egg ’. In the code the Hebrew Jehova emerges as the same as the Mayan G , the Egg. The two cultures worship the same G od, , under a different, and unexpectedly, synonymous name. As we will see, this is true of all the major religions. Eggs symbolize rebirth and repetition. This goes a long way toward explaining the puzzling tradition of decorating Easter eggs in commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus (pronounced G-sus ). He is considered the embodiment of G , the Word or Logos, the El-e-mental intergalactic material, and the son of Gehova, the Cosmic Christ Egg, the O, made flesh. The G ospel of John gave him eternal existence: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with G od, and the Word was G od.” 22 To the bird-brained the Word is considered the Life Force energy upon which the World is built. In sacred poetry the El-e-mental energy, G , is referred to as the ‘ Wood ’, the fifth element, known as the Quintessence and symbolized by the . 23 In the d-ark silence of their laboratories deep underground, El-e-ment-ary particle physicists (modern day wood workers) are exploring the secrets of this substance. They have established that a vast cosmic ocean of quintessence that is invisible to our telescopes and at least ten times as abundant as all the matter that we can see surrounds the visible galaxies. 24 If they are right, this “dark matter” or “black matter” that composes all that we can see “out there” is also “in here” in ourselves. This"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 20 implies that 9/10 of ourselves is unknown. What is the other 9/10 of our self capable of? For an answer we are left only with stories and myths of men and women who were skilled at tapping what Whitley Strieber poetically calls the ‘unknown country’ of humanity. One of these skilled ones was Jesus. We know this because in Christian symbolism wood represents the Holy Spirit. Everyone knows Jesus was a simple ‘carpenter’. If we make the small adjustment from Jesus as a wood worker to a Word worker it would make a stunning difference in the interpretation of his words. It would also begin to attune us with the skilled word worker Jesus who matches Dead Sea Scroll scholar Geza Verme’s ‘carpenter’, which, he says, stands for ‘scholar’ in certain Talmudic sayings. 26 Even more dramatically, it would cast Jesus as a light worker, a wielder of the El-e-mentary secrets of creation. These interpretations give new light to the meaning of the expression; “My boss is a Jewish carpenter.” As a scholarly ‘Word worker’, or poet, who speaks in parables, word puzzles, plays on words and riddles Jesus, whose name is the same as the prophesied Druid Sun god ‘Hesus’, reveals an inner tradition. This includes the secrets of the intergalactic material (the unknown soil) of which we are made, and the means to ignite higher human abilities. To use our term he emerges as a revealer of the code of the Healing Sun and a provider of a life-line ~ connecting the “in here” (the 1/10) and the “out there,” the hidden 9/10 of ourselves. Jesus’ use of this code is indicated in Mark 4:10-12 when he is asked about the parables. Jesus responds, “ To you who has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables; so that they"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 21 may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand ...” The writer of Mark affirms the existence of a secret code and a Mystery teaching, “And with many such parables spake he the Word to them, but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things .” 27 This clearly tells us there were two Words of Jesus, the exoteric and the esoteric . Why did Jesus speak in code? He answered this question too. “Because it is given unto you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath (the life~line) , to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance .” 28 In the apocryphal texts Jesus danced in the midst (core) of his inner circle. Then, as described in the famous Gnostic-Christian Pistis Sophia , 29 he tells his diciples to seek the means to turn themselves into light beings and talks about the afterlife in terms which have been borrowed heavily from the Egyptian Book of the Dead . 30 Next, he delivers elements of the spiritual key, the healing waves ~ of the cleansing mysteries that enabled him to transform himself into the Light of the world, or G . These Mystery Teachings of Jesus were not given to all. They were reserved for the seekers. Remember, it is given unto you to find these mysteries... within yourself. Shortly after Jesus’ death, a man named Paul found himself encapsulated in a light from Heaven on the road to Damascus (Qumran). 31 It forced him to his knees and blinded him. It was Jesus. Trembling, Paul, who formerly persecuted the followers of Jesus, asked him what he wanted him to do. Jesus sent him back to the city until one of his agents, Ana-nias, came to Paul’s house. Strangely, “the men who journeyed with him stood speechless,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 22 hearing a voice, but seeing no man !” 32 Paul spent three days without sight until Ana-nias arrived. He put his hands on Paul, returning his sight, and filling him with the Holy Spirit. 33 Afterward, though he had never seen Jesus teach, (though having him appear as an apparent being of light is a good start), Paul took it upon himself to interpret his Mystery Teachings. Likely finding Jesus’ word working all but impenetrable, instead Paul presented the Mystery of his experience in an ‘outer’ teaching about Jesus acceptable to the masses. He proclaimed Jesus the Healing Son of God and decided that Jesus offered himself as a blood sacrifice on the cross (+) to a tone for the sins of Adam and of all (O) who would believe in him. He would return one day to judge us. Jesus’ family, and other members of the Essene ~ Mother Church who regarded him as a mortal prophet, were aghast at Paul’s portrayal of Jesus as God. 34 Though Paul believed his experience on the road to Damascus (Qumran, home of the Essenes ~) singled him out for a special mission, his teachings were largely rejected by those closest to Jesus who flatly denied that he was a disciple. 35 They called him ‘spouter of lies’. Clearly they had a different ‘Jesus experience’ and drew from different Source material. It is not my intention to deliberately challenge, or dispute what ministers of the Gospels are presently teaching. However, I feel that serious re~evaluation of the teachings of Jesus could be made based upon the evidence, correlations and connections made concerning these secrets by the Healing Sun code. Though millions of Christians may feel otherwise, it seems to me that to confine oneself to Paul’s words about Jesus as the sum of his teaching is the same as believing that the sound of the dialing modem is the sum of the content of the Internet. It is like reading the cable program"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 23 guide but never watching the actual shows on television. The rest of the disciples, including Jesus’ family, transcended the static and tuned into the amazing ‘core’ teaching of Jesus. They took the ‘road less traveled to the unknown country’. For centuries seekers have sought the life~line of Jesus without the benefit of knowledge of the . However, as I will show, prior to Christianity various advanced cultures had full knowledge of all the code of the Healing Sun. Jesus mastered it. Even no less a personage than Saint Augustine (354-430 C.E.), a pillar of the early Church, said so. “That which is called the Christian Religion existed among the Ancients, and never did not exist, from the beginning of the human race until Christ came in the flesh, at which time the true religion which already existed began to be called Christianity.” 36 The original, true religion was a Healing Sun based, soul-centered science-religion. After the murder of Jesus, and most certainly fearing persecution themselves, Jesus’ family fled Palestine with his secrets concerning the Healing Sun code. They went sub rosa and remained silent about the key to the secrets of the Word . While very few before or after Jesus have succeeded in transforming themselves into a Christ-like beings, many learned enough of the code to vastly improve their well being by living in balance with the Healing Sun and its essence ~. Without understanding of this code many of Jesus’, and other Code Masters’, teachings have simply been under interpreted. The bedrock Christian notion that “man is conceived in sin” is one such statement. Sin has multiple levels of meaning in the code. Plainly spoken, sin is ignorance. In Christian terms the mastery of the code"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 24 enabled one to attain knoweldge and to bring G od down into our world to remove sin. Originally, the meaning of sin had to do with balancing the light of the Sun and Moon and the Moon-god of Mount Sinai. 37 The ancient Hebrews called the Moon Sin , because it gave light only part of the time. The word sin comes from Schin ( sheen or seen ), the twenty-first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and means to fall short of completeness, or understanding, wisdom. In the code what lays behind the word sin is an objective for our soul: to expand our minds, overcome our enmeshment in human (schin) skin and ignorance ala Paul and escape the web of Earth life. “Him that overcometh (sin),” said Jesus, “I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.” 38 Earth school is completed. For some, this occurs through an encounter with the Light of Heaven. In addition to the statements in the Gospels, there are writings of sects and groups that were founded exclusively for the purpose of preserving and disseminating the Healing Sun code and the secrets of the Light of Heaven. These sects have come to be known as “Gnostic,” which is the Greek word for “knowing,” because they believed salvation depended on the knowledge of Jesus rather than faith about him. For this reason the Church considers them heretics. In the next chapter we will grasp the life~line of Love to the Healing Sun offered by groups close to Jesus’ family who recorded the Mystery Teachings of instead of about their loved one."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 25 2. THE CRACK IN THE COSMIC EGG Perhaps the best known of all the Gnostic gospels is the Gospel of Thomas . This tiny book begins with the message that whoever understands it will live forever. 1 In this book Jesus explains directly that “it is to those who are worthy of my mysteries that I tell my mysteries.” 2 Obviously, the Gospel of Thomas is the Family’s gospel. One group who claimed to have known the Family secrets was the Cathars, a cluster of souls who lived in Southern France in the thirteenth century. The Cathars followed the Gnostic doctrines of Manicheaism , the dualistic religion of a prophet named Mani who was born in Babylonia c. 216 AD to a Virgin Goddess named Mar Miriam or Sancta Maria. He visited India and China, and won royal status in Persia (present day Iran). The cult Mani formed was a revival of the teachings of Zoroaster, a Persian savior who lived c. 600 BC. Mani deserves our attention because it is claimed that the Three Wise (Druid) Men who came to Jerusalem to honor the fulfillment of the prophecy of Christ’s arrival are believed to be disciples of Zoroaster. In addition the Gospel of Thomas was written by the Manichaeans who were followers not of Jesus, but of Mani. 3 There are substantial connections between Mani and Thomas, who, it is claimed, was Jesus’ twin brother. Mani received his revelations from an angel named at- Taum in Aramaic (Jesus’ language), a Tom in English. This name has been widely translated as Thomas, ‘the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 26 twin’. It is phonetically the same as Atom . Whereas the Gnostics believed Thomas was Jesus’ twin brother, the Manichaeans identified this ‘twin’ with the Holy Spirit . 4 No wonder, Mani’s teachings were very much in line with the Essenes ~, the Jewish sect out of which Jesus preached. He taught that God sent Jesus as a Messenger to make Adam eat from the Tree of Knowledge. 5 Christ, said Mani, was a pure spirit, his body was a phantom . The Secret Book of John tells how the disciple put his hand deep inside the body of Jesus. Obviously, Paul would find this description of Jesus’ body as a phantom quite illuminating. ‘Phantom’ comes from phane , meaning ‘to appear’. It means something that seems to appear to the sight but has no physical existence. When Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene as the Gardener (or Green Man) after his resurrection he said: “Do not touch me; for I am not yet ascended to my Father,” 6 hinting at his delicate ethereal form. Coincidentally, the Cathars live in a region whose soil is permeated with provocative myths and legends of Mary Magdalene. She fled here after the Crucifixion. According to the Knights Templar, she brought with her the secrets of Jesus (in the form of a wand or ray). 7 According to the heretics of Gnosis she brought his child. 8 Though it pales in comparison to the sexiness of the heresy that Jesus made love and had children, the wand symbol is worthy of considerable note in and of itself. When combined with the following fact it is sheer poetry. The word phane appears in myth as the name Phanes- Eros , the love god who pierced the veil of space-time and burst forth through a Cosmic Egg."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 27 Phanes in the Cosmic Egg. A serpent winds around his body. He holds the Wand of Miracles. He emerges from within a sea shell from which are bursting flames."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 28 In the depiction (previous), Phanes holds a lightning bolt in one hand the Wand of Miracles or Ray of Miracles in another. Also known as Aion , Phanes is the ‘Lord of Ages’, and ‘the Shining One’. His name means “to make manifest’ and ‘visible’, 9 or the Revealer. Fascinatingly, phane also appears in such words as epiphany , an appearance or apparition of a deity or other supernatural being. In Christian terms the Epiphany is a yearly festival celebrated on the sixth day of January, the Twelfth Day after Christmas. Christians celebrate it to commemorate the revealing of Jesus as the Christ to the Gentiles by the (Zoroastrian or Druid) Magi at Bethlehem. The Epiphany obviously connects Jesus with Phanes and the Cosmic Egg. The phantom body, common to Jesus and Phanes, sounds strikingly similar to the translucent body of light that is the goal of the Gnostic Grail questers, alchemists, and the Cathars. The Cathars, labeled as heretics by Orthodox Christianity, concluded that there was no historical Jesus at all. Instead Christ is an eternal spirit of knowledge. There is no need for us to atone for sins of the “Fall,” they said. Instead, we must seek the secrets of the Egg! THE GOSPEL OF LOVE The Cathars called themselves Pure Ones after a Goddess known as the Pure One, their term for the Virgin Great Creator Mother. The Pure Ones claimed to possess a secret Gospel of Love . 10 This mysterious manuscript is attributed to Jesus who gave it to John the Divine. The Gospel of Love was the foundation of the Cathar Church of Love. The existence of this lost (or hidden) Gospel was revealed when the Catholic Church subjected the Cathars to torture during the Inquisition. Its contents were said to transform ordinary men into immortals, or"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 29 Homo sapiens into Homo Christos , i.e. phantoms or Phanes, meaning beings who are capable of stepping into and crossing the waters of the Cosmic Egg. It is equated with the Holy Grail, the mystic receptacle used by Jesus to perform the Eucharist at the Last Supper when he poured wine for the disciples to drink, saying, “this is my blood (~)”. 11 The Cathars called their home in Southern France the Languedoc . Named after the language system the Cathar priests preached in -- the Language of Oc (possibly short for occamy , a corruption of alchemy) -- this place name is loaded with Healing Sun code. The word ‘language’ is self-explanatory. The ‘oc’ element, on the other hand, requires a bit of investigation. Webster’s says ‘Oc’ is the root of octo , 8, and ocular, the eye. 12 This gives us a clue that the Cathar ‘code of Oc’, as well as the Healing Sun code, concerns the eye or light. A related Egyptian word, Ak , means light. Aker means ‘light being’. As Mircea Eliade notes in Shamanism , among the Iglulik Eskimos a sequence of initiations concludes with the ang-ak-oq (virtually the same word as Languedoc or L’ang-ak-oq), meaning ‘lightening’ or ‘illumination’. 13 This angakoq, writes Eliade, consists of “ a mysterious light which the shaman suddenly feels in his body, inside his head, within his brain, an inexplicable searchlight , a luminous fire which enables him to see with both eyes , both literally and metaphorically speaking, for he can now, even with closed eyes, see through darkness and perceive things and coming events which are hidden from others.” 14 The emphasis here is on fire. Fire creates light. In our terms, through the angakoq the shaman overcomes sin (ignorance). Like Paul, he arises from the Earth and readies himself to bathe (his eyes, or I/ego) in the rays ~ or Holy Spirit of the Healing Sun. This initiation is exactly what the Cathars claimed they received from the Language of Oc. This “language of light,” also"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 30 known as the Language of the Birds, was the language in which the Cathars interpreted the Gospel of Love . If the Church possessed the ability to perform the profound light-working initiation of Jesus that he performed on Paul, it did not let on. Instead, it offered Paul’s teachings about Jesus and set about systematically persecuting and hideously exterminating the Cathars and other heretics who did possess these secrets. As many as one million men, women and children were slaughtered in the first European genocide (1204-1244) to insure the Catholic Church’s authority. 15 This is why the Gospel of Love was lost. It is unknown if the Church recovered Jesus’ core secret of light during its Inquisitions. The surviving Cathars concealed the secrets of this Gospel , and the Healing Sun code, in watermarks that were embedded in the paper they manufactured. Symbolist Harold Bayley documented this symbol system. 16 One of their first emblems was a pair of holy spectacles shown here. Freed of the Church’s dogma, and its burden of guilt, the Cathars put on their holy spectacles and focused on the Family Secrets of the Word (G) and the abundance it brings. These sacred glasses represented balance and revealed astonishing wonders. Among other purposes this symbol enabled the Cathars to recognize one another. The Bible states that God is Light and also that God is Love. John tells us that when the Love-Light is developed from within us, we shall"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 31 love our fellow travelers as God has loved us. It is then that we shall know the first and last wonders of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth: we are all One . As one’s perspective changes through these G lasses, we not only see our neighbor in a different light, but also the Healing Sun code reveals itself in subtle alterations of word meanings. For example, look at the code contained in the Sanskrit meaning of Tula, ‘balance’. Jesus exoterically taught the core concept of Tula, the balance or reconciliation of opposites, when he said: “I say to you, love your enemies , do good to them which hate you.” 17 Through the sacred G lasses the concept of a jealous, judgmental god and a horrific Judgment Day gives way to the gentler Core concept of judgment as embodying ‘balance’, ‘justice’ or even ‘peace’. ‘Love your enemies’. The symbols of the code reinforce this view. The zodiacal sign for Libra, the scales , representing balance is . To me, looks like the rising Healing Sun of the Milky Way on page 14. It represents the Holy Spirit . 18 Alchemists alternated between and when signifying the essence of a substance , or the spirit . 19 This means the and the ~ are the same. Balancing the ~ within ourselves with the of Tula places us in judgment or harmony, in scale (key), with G od. This is the unity of Heaven and Earth. The prophets call it Peace . In the language of light workers, ‘scale’ is described as tones, i.e. grey tone, greyscale, monotone. To be in scale with G od means to resemble or be of the same color or tone . Interestingly, the suffix phane means resembling , appearing like . Therefore, to be a phantom,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 32 like Phanes and Jesus, means we appear like, in scale or tone, with G od. Perhaps once we see or become this tone we have an epiphany and become Christ-like. At least, this appears to be what spontaneously and temporarily happened to Paul anyway, and what the Cathars could induce at will. One of the best ways to begin to understand the basics of the mystical Healing Sun mind-set the sacred G lasses provide is to begin by gazing at the three dimensional cube seen here. In 1832, a Swiss naturalist named L.A. Necker drew this three-dimensional cube on a piece of paper and noticed that its perspective had an odd way of reversing itself. The Necker Cube One moment the face that seemed to be in front would suddenly flip to the back and the back’s face would suddenly flip to the front. Although a shift in eye fixation or mental effort could make this happen, Necker discovered it happened spontaneously, chaotically , on its own, every few seconds."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 33 Technically, the Necker cube is twelve lines on a piece of paper. They are projected into and brought to life in our imagination. By understanding this cube is lines on a piece of paper we have taken one giant step toward understanding how we create our reality and how the Healing Sun can arise from another hidden dimension. Look at it this way. If this cube is twelve lines on a piece of paper it is a good possibility that this book is something completely different than it at first appears to be too. In fact, it is a chaotic collection of paper, ink, and glue that all comes together in our imagination and we call it a book. What would the science teacher tell us this book really is? At one level they might tell us it is a complex tool for storing ideas. At another level it is chapters, paragraphs, sentences, words, and letters that all come together and we call them a book. If we continued to look at this book from a different perspective, as through an ordinary microscope, for example, the surface disappears and the book transforms into a collection of wood fibers. Under a more powerful electron microscope, a veil is split and the spaces between the fibers become evident. A completely different world appears. Digging further into this molecular world, what once was a mere book composed of wood, now transforms into a space so enormous even the spiraling particles begin to shift and fade. An inner universe appears. The paper upon which the ink representing these letters is composed of atoms, molecules, traces of particles; a fluid soup composed of a bunch of floating stuff that we can’t see, but which comes together in our imagination as a pattern of living energy and we call it a book. Below the atomic structure the particles shift into probability patterns of living energy. These patterns of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 34 living energy, the Word , are the stuff of modern physics, one category of which are called quarks , which physicists claim is another a~tom and is, therefore, the essential building block of matter. This is where science and religion unite, for scientists have never seen a quark. They take it on faith that they exist. They create mental pictures of what they think (guess) the immaterial atom looks like. With a mixture of terror and merriment they imagine a blur of electrons surrounding a tiny dot • nucleus that draws the electrons to it like a swarm of bees to honey. It is remarkable that when symbolizing the smallest unit of matter Western scientists used the same ideogram as that used by the ancients to symbolize the galaxy , and as we will see, the Galactic Core •, which is called the hidden sun behind the Sun . (In Chinese symbolism means sun and person.) No two physicists or chemists view the atom exactly the same way because the building blocks of these images are symbols called equations that exist only in their minds. In this way the book you are reading, actually a collection of atoms or quarks does not really exist anywhere but in your imagination. Likewise for the chair you are sitting on. Put on your holy G lasses. Take a good look around. Everything you perceive is a collection of a~toms and molecules brought to life in your imagination. EVERYTHING ‘out there’ is made of the same things as this book. As the Buddhists teach, “all the world’s a dream.” In reality, there is no book. It is just one part of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 35 the One Thing ; the transcendent spiritual essence ~ of which we are all made. This reflection scales us up to the core of what is meant when it is said that with the holy G lasses the Cathars recognized one another. They recognized each other as One, and a mirror image of G in the circle of all creation. This mental process is called a paradigm shift. The word paradigm comes from the Greek paradigma (“pattern”). Essentially what this means is that people go about their lives perceiving only that which fits in with their idea of what the pattern should look like, they develop a mind set. Whether we care to acknowledge their existence or not these mindsets are very powerful. They operate on us subliminally determining how we experience the world from the most primitive levels of our mind/brain system. Our world mirrors our mind-sent. However, there occasionally comes a time when the phenomena perceived by our advanced brains that do not fit can no longer be ignored. This usually results in a paradigm shift. During such times the Healing Sun code guides the way to the next level. Though this code remains buried in the mists of time as fossil poetry, it is not lost. Actually, it is buried in our neuro-circuitry. PHOSPHENES J.D. Lewis-Williams, an Australian professor of cognitive archeology and director of the Rock Art Research Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand (Australia) and T.A. Dowson are leading researchers in this area. In their article ‘The Signs of All Times’ they propose a neurobridge backwards in time to the Upper Paleolithic by which we can gain insight into the nature of the origins of the Healing Sun code. 20"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 36 The neurobridge is based on the idea that human anatomy has remained basically the same since c. 100,000 BC. 21 Approximately 40,000 years ago a cultural ‘big bang’ occurred when the linguistic abilities coded in DNA abruptly emerged. 22 This unexplained‘big bang’ included an enormous leap forward in art and religion accompanied by astonishing advances in technology and social organization. Where did this knowledge come from? In the signs of Upper Paleolithic art Lewis-Williams and Dowson see entoptic phenomena very similar to those produced by people in altered states of consciousness today. ‘Entoptic’ is derived from the Greek for ‘within vision’, that is, anywhere within the optic system between and including the eye itself and the cortex where signals from the optic nerve are. 23 The term “ phosphene ” ( phos , light, phainein , to show) refers to the entoptic images received by the human brain as visual images in the absence of visual stimuli. Phosphenes (or phos- phanes ) can be revealed by gentle physical pressure (such as the patterns seen when you close your eyes and apply gentle stimulation to your eyelids), and ‘form constants’ which are produced beyond the eye in the cortex itself. Phosphenes are geometric patterns whose origins are in the nervous system itself. They transcend time. Shown here are drawings of basic phosphene designs and petroglyphs from the American Southwest. 24 These forms are found in Upper Paleolithic art and contemporary research into drug induced visions. 25 Many of them are familiar to us."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 37 Phosphene designs (left) and petroglyphs. In addition to the ~, , and the we see also the grid, described variously as lattice, filigree, honey comb, grating #, fretwork and chessboard; and the O, which is described as a tunnel, also associated with the cone, vessel, funnel, whirlwind, and alley. In addition there is an X, dots •, and the Egyptian hieroglyph for neter , meaning gods. It is the same as the almond-shaped doorway seen in the Neolithic tunnel drawing and the Cosmic Egg of Phanes. This symbol resembles the Milky Way. Curiously, it is duplicated in the Chinese character for visit and eye"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 38 . To answer our former question, the words and symbols of the Healing Sun code and their meanings appear in numerous faiths because many of them originate from within our neuro-circuitry. The Healing Sun code is hard-wired into our brains. Its symbols and words cross over mediums and interlock in remarkable ways to hide and reveal the secret of the Healing Sun. No matter where they occur, the bottom-line message is the same: the Healing Sun rises from within us when we place ourselves in balance with its energies. This prepares us for a journey through the to visit the Core and see G eye to eye . Consider the code found in this painting of Jesus. Jesus has at his navel the spiral by which he materialized into this world, and returned home. We see the Sun and Moon on either side of him. Together they symbolize balance. The Egyptians imagined the Deity as possessed of two eyes, the Sun and Moon, the Left and Right Eyes of Horus. They believed that the ideal human would have this dual or balanced sight bestowed on them as a gift from the gods, and that with two eyes they would have the ability to become a radiant and perfectly healthy, i.e. a wise (phantom) being. To use a Christian term they would overcome ‘sin’ and be reborn as stars in the Cosmic Egg. They would return to the land of the immortals."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 39 Jesus on the Cross. Note the spiral of return at his navel. Rome 12 th century. The Cathars called this Promised Land AM-OR , love . They said Jesus came from this place. 26 He had come to deliver the holy G lasses and lead his sheep out of Earth or ROMA (the mirror image of AM-OR). The word am (M) in Hebrew not only signifies might, strength, power, and truth, but it also means mother , as in Genesis 2:24, and"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 40 love . 27 The sacred Aum or Om of the Hindus, referred to in the Upanishads as the “mother of all sound,” is evidently the same as Am . All these terms refer to the Queen of Heaven, the Core. I find it intriguing that so many of the discoveries concerning the Healing Sun have occurred in Am -erica or Amor-ica . This may be for good reason. The Puritans who came to America on the heels of Church persecution were the spiritual descendents of the Pure Ones, the Cathars. The Founding Fathers who set the tone for the future of America believed that the founding of America is Jehova’s undertaking. It is the continuation of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (“Israel”) and the fulfillment of His promise to “assemble the outcasts (or outbursts) of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the Earth” in the process of creating the new of Heaven on Earth. Fascinatingly, George Washington, the ‘father’ of America and a Mason, was depicted in Masonic regalia with a radiant “ G ” above his head. The G ’s presence is explained as being the initial of “glory,” “grandeur,” even “God.” 28 Though we know it as symbol code for the Galactic Core. A complimentary symbol is the Great Seal of the United States, which features the Eye of God enclosed within a radiant triangle. Designed in 1776 under the watchful eye of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, 29 the Great Seal is the ‘logo’ for the American Mission."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 41 George Washington wears his Masonic girdle that features the symbols of the Healing Sun code including two pillars forming an arch and an open Book of Life.

This indicates that the one-dollar bill is a carrier of symbol code for the Healing Sun. So too is the Oval Office of the President. What is the code concealed in the Great Seal on the dollar bill? According to Masonic symbolism researcher David Ovason, 31 to Freemasons this symbol, and the building of Washington D.C. itself, represented the rebuilding of the Temple of Sol- Om- On, the King of the Jews ( c. 1100 BC). The Koran says Solomon used the Language of the Birds to achieve immense wealth and wisdom. 32 He (or the Essenes) buried the secrets of his temple, assuredly including the Family secrets (since Solomon is an ancestor of Jesus), in the soil beneath his temple. Masonic fraternities of the United States visualized the nation’s capital in Washington D.C. as the founding stone of a new Golden Age that would see the Second Coming of the Healing Son and the return of Solomon’s secrets."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 43 Sol- om -on’s Temple is clearly shown as a pyramid on the Great Seal. This automatically takes our mind toward Egypt, home of the Great Pyramid. History records this structure is a tomb for a pharaoh (though no mummy has ever been found in its hallowed halls). This leads many to propose an esoteric purpose for this enigmatic machine. Thanks to the Masons we are given insight into the purpose of the pyramids. To contrast the Healing Sun the Masons used the symbol of a tomb or a coffin. This says Ovason, represented the botanic promise of new life emerging from within. This is the Masonic meaning of the All-Seeing Eye. It also represents the telluric forces arising from the soil of the Earth. 33 Putting two and two together, in the code we learn that the Founding Fathers seem to have believed that stellar energies of the Core were deposited in the soil of Washington D.C. and that these energies assured their success. We do not have to wander deep into the esoteric code symbols of the Masons to find evidence of General George Washington’s interest in stellar energies or knowledge of the code. All we need to do is study his Masonic costume, which is loaded with deep astrological and cosmological lore, or visit Washington D.C. From its foundation in 1791 this city was designed with esoteric principles in mind. The architecture in the center of Washington D.C., says Ovason, 34 speaks the ancient language of the stars. It is closely linked with the constellation Virgo, the Virgin of the Christian religion. She is Isis to the Egyptians who, we shall not be surprised to learn, was the goddess of the Core. As will be affirmed as we continue, the Healing Sun rises from within and affects our ocular abilities, our sight. In addition to the phosphenes, most likely this has to do with the Optic Thalamus, meaning, “light of the chamber,” 35 the inner or third eye, situated at the center of the head. It connects the pineal gland and the pituitary"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 44 body. The optic nerve starts from this “eye single” or “All seeing eye” (shown at the top of the pyramid on the Great Seal above) “If thine eye be single (or in balance),” said Jesus, “thy whole body will be full of light.” The Optic Thalamus is called a “lamp,” and indicates “rays,” “light,” or “vibration.” 36 By activating the third eye millions of dormant cells of the brain are presumably resurrected and set in motion (vibration). The brain is attuned ( scaled ) to higher spiritual vibrations (the tones of the Healing Sun). The Eye of spiritual understanding is opened. We don our holy spectacles. We have overcome Sin. Take a good look around. The outer eyes see only by reflection. The inner eye sees by vibration ~, feeling. One way we know we are using this inner eye comes from the impulse of putting our hand over our third eye for a moment when trying to tune into something. Frequently, this will lead to an ‘aha’ experience in which we exclaim, “Oh, G ee, now I see .” This sudden illumination turns on the vibrations of G within. The inner eye connection may explain why the Greek term mysterion was derived from the verb musteion , meaning ‘to close the eyes or mouth’. The mystery of the Healing Sun code reveals itself when we close our eyes . In some cases contact with the light can be very dangerous. In 1971 experiments carried out on Apollo 14, were conducted to study whether cosmic rays that penetrate the optic nerves were responsible for the alleged optical flashes astronauts had been experiencing. 37 The current technical name for this type of ‘optical flashes’ is “phosphenes,” a term with which we are familiar. The general thrust of the papers/research was on safety investigations to determine realistic human tolerance levels for extended missions and to evaluate the need to provide special spacecraft shielding. An abstract of one of these papers states:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 45 “Details are presented of an investigation aimed at an explanation of the phenomenon of light flashes observed by Apollo crew members. The various theories considered include: penetration of the eye by cosmic particles resulting in retinal stimulation; production of phosphenes or sensations of light through ionization or excitation; appearance of heavily ionized single tracks misinterpreted as light flashes; Cerenkov radiation; and direct excitation of neural tissue by penetrating cosmic rays. It is concluded that the latter two theories are the likeliest mechanisms for the development of a definitive Explanation.” In summary, as these initial examples demonstrate, secret Gnostic schools and mystic societies had deep awareness of the sacred nature of the energies of the Galactic Core for millennia. It has inspired poets, prophets, priests, politicians and, as we will explore, physicians of the soul alike. Their interest in the Core, and the energy emanating from it, was impressed in a code that was expressed for those ‘with eyes to see’ in their artwork, myths, and scripture. As NASA learned, the rays of this Healing Sun exist in space. Its symbols lead to awareness of our inner spiritual abilities and a world vision or world paradigm founded on a G spiritual basis."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 46"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 47 3. HERSCHEL’S GARDEN Apart from Southern France, where the Cathars lived, and Washington D.C., one of my favorite places to seek the gate to the land of the immortals is Aspen, Colorado. During one Fourth of July when I was there Aspen was aglow with the light of celebrities and beautiful people who shimmered like gold nuggets amidst the crowded streets. At night, the golden glow of Aspen gave way to the icy pure light of the stars. From the high peaks of the Rocky Mountains in Aspen, the ambient light that normally obscures the stars is absent. The night sky is ablaze. A fiery river of billions of stars flow overhead like a thick blanket of sparkling diamonds gushing ‘softer than a lullaby’ toward a jeweler’s black velvet cloth. Like the Hopi petroglyph painter in Arizona, the cave artist in Mongolia, the ancient Egyptian scribe, and the Peruvian shaman before me, I stood on this magnificent incandescent river’s edge feeling Rocky Mountain high. I wiped the phosphenes from my eyes and shook my head in wonder. What I asked with awe and reverence, is this that I am a part of? ...What am I -- doing here? ...Who cares ?! The Milky Way is a luminous flattened disk. When we look at it in the night sky, the ‘river’ we are looking along is the edge of a spinning wheel. It is as if we are looking into the silvery hub of a spinning bicycle wheel lying"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 48 on its side. Earth is on the Orion ‘spoke’ of the Galaxy. A few facts about our galaxy will provide some perspective. The Milky Way is 13-15 billion years old. It contains 100 billion stars. It is 100,000 light years across. As the moon and Earth revolve around the Sun, so too does our entire solar system orbit the galactic center of our galaxy. It takes our sun about 200 million years to complete its orbit of the Galactic Core, which is 23,000 light-years from Earth. 1 The Central Nuclear Bulge of the Milky Way is a mass concentration of stars. It is invisible to the naked eye because its light must travel through thousands of light-years of gas and cosmic dust before it reaches us. Though it is the center and source of all great religion, many myths emphasize that, like its light, the secrets of the Core have remained hidden from the mass of humanity for millennia. The hidden Healing Sun, also known as the ‘Black Sun’•, has been veiled. To pull back this veil is to reveal the secrets of creation . How and when we first learned about the Core is unknown. (That we know of it at all is amazing in itself.) There must have been a first man or woman who put on the sacred glasses, looked beyond the pall of Earth and recognized that we live in a spiral-shaped galaxy. Science credits this to Sir William Herschel (1738-1822), who also discovered the planet Uranus (named after the Greek word for Heaven). Herschel ( Her Skill ), an oboist, was among the first to propose that numerous other galaxies exist in the celestial band. For a time the universe, thought to be comprised of a mere handful of galaxies, was known as ‘Herschel’s Garden’. However, as our investigation into the linguistic and artistic code of the Healing Sun shows, the ancients long ago made similar revelations and conclusions as modern"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 49 science. These revelations form the basis of the unified original religion, the religion of the Galactic Core, G , or the Healing Sun. Their first expression upon seeing the Core is unknown. However, before the Greeks the Egyptians looked out across the Nile, “the Milky Way on the Earth,” and called the goddess of balance and justice Ma or Maat . Ma is the mirror image of the code word am . “ Ma-Ma ” or “ M-am-a ” means “mother’s breasts” in nearly all languages. 2 The concepts of Ma , mother, peace, justice, balance (Tula), and am , mighty strength, healing, and the Core of our galaxy have gone together in the Healing Sun code for a very long time. They travel the seas of time along with the concept of the Healing Son, and his twin, the Black Sun. Interestingly, the Black Sun was another name for Phanes. Like the Healing Sun, normally this Egg-jumper is hidden or concealed (hence black). He was considered the light god’s (the 1/10) adversary, says Barbara Walker, not because he was originally viewed as evil, but because he represented a sleeping or quiescent phase of the same god (the missing or ‘black’ 9/10). 3 The Greeks claimed Phan or Pan , the‘God of All’, (10/10) was the same as the Egyptian solar god Amon-Ra, 4 who also is thought to have been the priest king of Atlantis (which the Mayans called Tula). Thule is another name for Tula and derives from the Greek word Tolas meaning black earth . 5 Another name for Egypt is the Black Land, hinting that the land of Egypt was Tula. The same may be said in Spain where someone declared that the Milky Way once touched the ground. Ley lines or energy lines that mirror the energy from the stars of the Milky Way comprise the famous pilgrimage and alchemist’s trail that has been taken by people for hundreds of years. 6 Called “the road of stars of Santiago de Compostela” or El Camino, “royal path,” this sacred"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 50 road stretches nearly 500 miles across northern Spain. It is said that this royal road mirrors the Milky Way. Pilgrims have been using the galaxy to guide themselves to Compostela since the Stone Age. There is something about the combination of the energies and the connection made to them by our feet hitting the ground that initiate a chain of biochemical-spiritual events that result in the healing and transformation of the pilgrim. Perhaps this explains why Jehova commanded Moses to “Put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.” 7 Along the Camino de Santiago have walked kings, queens, cripples, lepers, popes, cardinals, peasants, artisans, gypsies, saints and even criminals. All have sought to infuse themselves with the sacred energy of the Milky Way hidden in the soil. 8 Rather than sentence thieves to jail, in the Middle Ages justice was found in the walk to Compostela to the tomb of the apostle James’ (Jesus’ brother, who became the head of the Jerusalem Mother Church after Jesus’ exit). It was figured that the walk, the interchange of energies, and the experience of meeting other pilgrims would spiritually transform the soul of a criminal. The esoterically-minded ancients also believed that there was a “door” or “gate” at the end of the road of stars through which the energy of the Healing Sun entered and through which we enter the land of the immortals. The Bible speaks of the ‘gates’ 9 or ‘doors’ 10 through which God opens to make himself manifest 11 or to shower his blessings ~ on humankind. 12 These same ‘doors’ or ‘gates’ were used in the New Testament to symbolize the Second Coming of Jesus and of Christ himself. 13 In the Book of Genesis this gate was located at Eden. Here we find the thread of the code of the Core. As we all know, after Adam and Eve’s eviction from the Garden God placed a revolving flaming sword at the Gate of Eden to prevent humanity from re-entering the Garden. 14"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 51 When we lift this thread and examine it, we learn that the story of Adam and Eve and Eden are not original. Eden likely derived from Eridanus , an ancient name for the Milky Way. Eridanus was the Stream of Ocean, 15 the River of Heaven ~, that moves like a helix, or an 8 (just like our DNA). The word Eridanus has been traced to Eridu , the place whose “pure light reaches heaven.” 16 Its phenomenal story is worth a momentary look. Eridu. The headquarters of E.A. Eridu was the first Sumerian city ( c. 3800 B.C.). It was built upon virgin soil; no previous buildings existed before its temples were constructed. Its sudden arrival, its extensiveness, and its advanced state of civilization perplex scholars. Eridu (present day Kuwait/Iraq region) was the original earthly throne of E.A.

He was also frequently depicted as holding vases of flowing waters. He was the original Water Bearer, 20 and baptizer, a fact that will have enormous significance momentarily. Most importantly, as far as our search is concerned, he was depicted with two serpents entwined around his body (ala the Cosmic Egg).

One of his most important connections to the code of the Healing Sun is discovered in the Sumerian writings that say that at Eridu, his (garden) center of incredible power, he taught the secrets of civilization and life. His student was Adapa, the Sumerian inspiration for the Hebrew first man Adam, whose story antedates the book of Genesis by millennia. The secrets of Eridu were contained in the divine ME (pronounced MAY or maize ) Tablets. The ME Tablets are crucial to our understanding of the hidden religious codes of the Galactic Core (including those of the Ma -sonic or"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 55 Maysonic order). These mysterious crystal-like objects, sometimes worn as ornaments on the body of the gods, contained advanced scientific knowledge including astronomy, astrology, temple building, as well as gardening and smithcraft. 23 In myth, the ME are linked to the Emerald Tablets of Thoth/Hermes, the Egyptian and Greek version of E.A.’s son Ninghishizidda, the Lord of the Key of Life. The Emerald Tablets contained the healing secrets of the gods including the existence of a fountain of immortality. There are many rivers, but only one Source. The heavenly water or dew connection evident in the place name Eri- du hints at the possibility that a primary subject of E.A.’s ME tablets was baptism in these waters. According to a tantalizing Hebrew legend, the Hebrew patriarch Abraham discovered the Emerald Tablets. They were in the shape of a tesseract . 19 The tesseract is a three- dimensional “shadow” of a four dimensional hypercube - - a figure having yet another dimension at right angles (L’s) to the three dimensional cube with which we are familiar.

Members of some ancient mystic cults have been said to meditate for hours upon the tesseract until they experienced a shift of perception -- the opening of a gateway from the to another dimension . Once through this ‘doorway’, the individuals are often greeted by beings from this dimension. Equally often, healing energies or energies for new growth are accessed to effect cures on Earth. These energies, introduced by the Fish God E.A. are the contents of what Christians consider the Holy Grail, the cup of the Fisher King, Jesus.

What we can conceive we can achieve. We can even send this healing energy to others and heal them at a distance by directing loving, compassionate thoughts, intentions and prayers to them. These energies can even heal without the person receiving them being aware of their existence. This explanation of the tesseract gives light to the legend that Abraham possessed the ME tablets and the Biblical account of his meeting with the Lord. In Genesis, Abraham is gazing out the door of his tent into the desert on a hot day. Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, the Lord and two messengers appear to him. 27 Instead of gazing out a physical door, could Abraham have been gazing into the emerald tesseract, the doorway to other dimensions, beyond the quantum level to hyperspace ? Did this open a portal for G od to appear ? Was this the same gateway through which E.A. appeared and delivered the ME? The ME, as we will explore later, once belonged to the divine goddess Tia-Mat (the Holy Mother). Possession of these information storage devices and the code required to decipher their teachings conferred tremendous power: they connected humanity with the gods. Fascinatingly, this connection may not be completely ethereal.

MYTHOLOGY As children many of us were taught that God is love. The secrets of God, call them ME or call them the Holy Grail, we would like to believe, are the secrets of love. Strangely enough, this is indicated by the etymology of the word ME-thology or mythology . My-tho-logy means telling the thoughts, tho , of the Word ( G ), logia , of my . Webster’s 28 says the root my is a shortened form of min , of ME , my, mine, the possessive form of I (or Self). Mythology is therefore the thoughts of ME . In order to recover the secrets of the ME we must step into the world of mythology. When we follow this trail we are intrigued to find that Min is the root for min ister, a conduit between man and God. Minne was the name given to Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love , by the medieval Min strels or Minne singers, 29 the devotees of Mary Magdalene in southern France who introduced the Grail romances to the world. These wandering poets or bards said Minne (and therefore, ME) meant Love . 30 A mythmaker or mythologist is therefore a love maker , which explains why the medieval poets and minstrels called their sacred Grail tales romances . Their predecessors were the Cathar priests of the Goddess of Love (ME or Min), who gave them the gift of inspiration from her magic cup, the Holy Grail. 31 Mythology is, therefore, that branch of science that encodes the secrets that enables us to more fully connect with the place of love, the Core. It is the science of the ME.

Those who keep the secrets of the mysterious Healing Sun are called “ way -openers” and “ path -finders.” They help us lift the veil and find and open the gate. Next, they invite us on a voyage of return to the Source of the waters ~~. In the code the word ‘ way ’ is ‘ why ’, or simply, Y, rendering the Wayshowers as Y Show-ers. Perhaps George Washington can offer the best clue to explain the importance of the Y. As David Ovason observes, early maps of Washington D.C. clearly depict a Y-shaped branch that supported Washington’s layout for the city. The Y was made up of the Potomac River receiving the waters of (or confluencing with) the Eastern Branch, or Anacostia. 32"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 61 Assuredly the Founding Fathers recognized the Y as the Pythagorean Y, a drawing of the path of life, in which the pilgrim (and America) is continuously confronted with choices of spiritual directions: good or evil? Love or fear? After the decision the binding law of cause and effect becomes operative. Our choices become the branches by which we scale the heights to Heaven. It is important to notice that Ge or Je (J) is pronounced Y. This is why Jehova became Yehova or Yahweh. As such, the Founding Fathers likely also recognized the Y as symbolic of the G rail cup. For thousands of years, beginning with the goddess tradition, a V has symbolized the Grail in the code. Only when the Grail cup of love, the V, is balanced atop the I pillar ( I symbolizes Jesus, in connection with electricity it means power on ) does it form a Y, a cup capable of holding the energies of the Cosmic Egg, or G . This concept is expressed in an Egyptian symbol found in the fourth pyramid . The code is also found in the burial chamber of the Tomb of Ramses VI. On the north wall is the mysterious Book of Aker , the Book of Light . 33 According to the myth, Nut , the Core, swallows the sun each evening and gives birth to it each morning, ‘younger than it was the evening before’. The mystery of this re- Generation is the subject of the Book of Ak-er . Moses also demonstrated this power of re- Generation for us. The Bible tells us that in his battle with the Amalek Moses’ hands grew heavy, and the Israelites took a stone and put it under him, and Hur and Aaron held Moses’ arms outstretched. 34 Through this body posture -- the Y -- Moses served to create a conducting channel for the inflow of the power of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 62 the Holy Spirit to aid the Hebrews in their battle against darkness (ignorance).

In"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 63 this episode Moses secretly, but overtly in the code, reveals himself as a Way Shower or Y Show-er to Tula, the Promised Land. THE SONG OF G The full appreciation of the I, V, Y, G rail symbolism and its meaning in the Healing Sun code moves us to a deeper level than the Sunday School story or the Indiana Jones McGuffin version of the Holy Grail. Far from a simple carpenter’s cup, the Grail is in fact a symbol for a deep Mystery teaching of a profound Word worker. A sip from this wisdom cup blows open the doors of perception and reveals the healing light of the realm of immortality . So what happens when we follow the Y Show-ers and allow this energy to flow through us ala Moses? The key to elucidating this aspect of the code is to remember that, in esoteric terms, alchemists know the Holy Grail as the ‘Stone of God’. 35 It is equated with the Philosopher’s Egg or Stone of Immortality. 36 Some believe the Grail’s secrets -- which enable the transmutation of the elements -- are literally written on a green stone, i.e. the Emerald Tablet of Thoth/Hermes, who is really Ningishzidda, the son of E.A. The transmutation of the elements is the domain of the alchemists, who sought to make gold out of baser metals. Under the influence of the Emerald Tablets or ME tablets the doctrine arose that metals, like human beings, had body and soul, the soul being regarded as an ethereal form (hyperdimensional). They said that the soul or original essence ~~ was common to all metal, and in order to transmute one metal into another they had to produce a ‘tincture’ of its original soul. 37 This was called the Philosopher’s Stone. It had the power to make the sick"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 64 (base) metal well (gold). This is the origin of the concept of the universal medicine. Since person, sun and gold are identical in hieroglyphics , the sick (ignorant) are made well through the rising of the Healing Sun within. A very powerful idea that we will encounter again and again is that of sprouting, procreation and re- Generation . We are told by the adepts of the past that metals grow like plants and reproduce like animals. Gold begets gold, corn begets corn, and man, man. A gold tincture was therefore added to the mixture intended to produce the fruit, gold. 38 Interchangeable with the concept of the Philosopher’s Stone is the symbol of the Philosopher’s Egg . This symbol is equivalent to the “Egyptian stone,” 39 and the dragon that bites its tail, the O (which we will explore later). The egg is the galaxy, G , the Cosmic Egg (Tula). is a sign in the Egyptian hieroglyphic system representing the land of Egypt (Tolas, the Black Land). To me, this is quite amazing. The form is a G , and is associated with , the sign for thread , and , the ideogram for a return or a homecoming . In the code we could write “Egyptian stone” as , and interpret Egypt as a land of transformation or the land of the thread that returns us home (to Tula). This conclusion is consistent with the alternate name of Egypt, Khemennu , 38 the root of chemistry and alchemy. Moses, we are told, was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds. 39 Reading between and on top of the lines, it suggests he was an alchemist who tied the thread between and the G , the place of herons.

In the code the Stone of God is actually a (S)tone or a tone of the Healing Sun. It is a tune or a chord (or cord ~) from the Cosmic Egg that links man and God . Corresponding to the G is the musical notation , the G-clef. This universal sign is used to denote music in general. The connection of the galaxy likely explains why in music the symbol for galaxy is used to denote tones or whole notes . (As we have seen gen-eral means whole. ) Like the stone upon which Moses stood, this ‘stone’ or (s) tone is never identified. We are tempted to identify it with the Stones of Heaven used by Joshua’s grandfather Jacob to open a gate to Heaven. In the story Jacob lay his head on a stone and saw a ladder that reached into Heaven. 40 The Lord appeared and gave Jacob a ‘seed’. 41 As I will fully explain later, this gateway is located in the eye, and in our perception. As I will also make clear, the “quest for the Grail” was the quest to tune our DNA so that it rings, sings or vibrates a certain way. This created a “love song in the blood,” a San Graal (‘Holy Blood’) or Song Grail , that tunes or scales the instrument of G od, our souls , to the ‘Key of Life’ or the tone of G .

THE KEY OF LIFE From the above word and symbol plays we can see that in the Healing Sun code the Holy Grail is a tone or a key that opens the Door or Tunnel (a O or (w)hole) of Life to the Cosmic Egg . This is why it is interchanged with another vital code symbol, the Key of Life. To make this connection let us turn to Egypt in c. 1,400 BC, about the time of Moses. The Egyptian king Akhen- aton , another Way Shower or Y Show-er, was frequently depicted calling down and receiving energy in the form of the ankh or Key of Life from the Central Sun Disk (opposite). Akh , we know, means ‘light’. Akhenaton introduced a monotheistic Mystery religion based upon the principles of light of the winged Sun Disk that he called Aton .

These tones are keys to the door and the Mysteries. The door key The Key to the Mysteries From the earliest times, creation mythologies said all organic and inorganic matter was composed of combinations of four elements: earth, air, fire and water.

One Key of Life was to place oneself in tune or resonance with the healing rays through the body posture. As in the illustration shown here, the pharaoh was also baptized in ‘ ankhs ’ or keys of life symbolizing the wisdom of the living waters of Aton, the Healing Sun. The Egyptians called this stream of water mes (maize), 2 which obviously returns our thoughts to the Sumerian ME. As the illustration on the next page illustrates, water and life were equated in ancient Egypt.

Max Freedom Long notes that the Hebrew title for Jehova, Adoni (“Lord”), which is derived from Aton (“Sun”), is related to adow . 3 The basic meaning of the word is “to wash the body all over.” 4 In terms of the code the Lord, G , the Source of the baptismal waters, was the Healing Sun. In the Polynesian Huna healing tradition, which Long traces to Egypt, the word for “Lord” is h-aku , and the meanings of the two root parts, ha and ku give us, roughly, “prayer,” plus the meaning of “the one whom the prayer reaches.” 5 A related word, hekau , is Hebrew for words of power . 6 In the previous depiction of Akhenaton (or Aku - naton) we see him reaching to Aton while he is ‘praying’ or (p) ray- ing (bathing in the rays or tones of Aton). The reappearance of the word ak signals that it is time"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 72 we peered deeper into this ancient science of prayer. According to Lucie Lamy, the daughter of the great French Egyptologist Schwaller de Lubicz, in the Egyptian cosmogonic myths, akh (‘spirit’) is the Pharaonic word for all aspects of light, particularly the ‘transcendental’ light of the transfiguration. 7 It is that aspect of our spirit, which conceives in advance what the object of creation, will be. 8 Akh, she notes, plays a considerable role in the sacred language. 9 This word akh is written with a glyph showing a crested ibis bird, which was also called the akh . 10 This bird -- interchangeable with the heron -- is the bird of Thoth, the Egyptian inventor of language and god of magic who was depicted gloriously as half-man, half-bird. The akh bird’s crest, together with its dark green plumage shot with glittering metallic specks gave rise to the meanings ‘to shine’, ‘to be resplendent’, ‘to irradiate’, of the root akh in the hieroglyphic writing. 11 It is of great interest to me that the Egyptian hieroglyph of the heron , the bird of akh (light), so closely matches the stylized fish glyph of Jesus , though it predates him by millennia. In addition, these two symbols are structurally identical to , the mathematical sign sometimes used for infinity, which spells Oc . This fuses the Language of the Birds and the Language of Oc, the language code that the Cathars used to decode the secrets of Jesus. The Hebrew word a-dow , to wash, we noted, is related to dew (vowels are interchangeable in the code). The Egyptian hieroglyph mst (mist) looks like a three-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 73 fold fall of radiating water. It means “celestial tears” or “ dew ,” 12 and portrays drops of water falling or radiating from Heaven. The same hieroglyphic also means “instruction,” or “teaching.” 13 Structurally, it matches the symbol of the Holy Spirit. Fascinatingly, dow is spelled Tau or Tao (pronounced ‘dow’) in China and means ‘Is-land’ and ‘Way’, an appellation of Christ. As we have seen, the ankh is formed when the hieroglyphic is set upright on the Tau cross. Filling in, as the initiate must, we know that all these ‘Ways’ have their origins in the science and religion of the Healing Sun. When washed in its rays we are instructed. This explains why the hieroglyphic for dew is closely related to ire , “to instruct,” and is linked with the Egyptian concept of baptism; when the celestial wisdom (rays, tones) channeled through the Key of Life is poured upon the pilgrim. I find it interesting that the dew in the hieroglyph on the right appears to be emerging from a cross, the code symbol adopted by Christianity for the Way. I also find it most illuminating that the meaning of the hieroglyphic ire , to instruct, is exactly the same as the Sumerian word for E.A.’s headquarters, Eridu or Eri Dew . Here we would be wise to look up the meaning of ‘dew’ in a dictionary. Anything regarded as refreshing, gently falling, pure, etc., is considered like dew, says Webster’s . 14 In Christian terminology, the blood that falls drop by drop from Christ’s crucified body is also the heavenly dew . In the Jewish Kabbalah, the dew is an emanation or radiation from the Tree of Life (the +), which emerges as a conduit with the Healing Sun . (In legend, the Cross upon which Jesus was crucified was made from the wood of the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 74 Tree of Life that grew in the Garden of Eden. The Key of Life was made from a branch of this Tree.) The Book of Genesis says that “in the beginning” “the spirit (Akh) of God moved ~ upon the face of the waters .” These ‘waters’ are the divine substance of creation, which the Sumerians called the pure light or Eridu . To summarize, baptized or irradiated in this way, by the pure water, (f) ire and wisdom of the pure dew of the Healing Sun, the pilgrim received knowledge (perhaps in the form of phosphenes) of the Way to the higher world of the Core. Their DNA sings to a New Song. The ir-i s of the eye opens a hole in Heaven. If the blood flowing through their heart was pure they saw G . They were called in Hebrew msche , roughly meaning “born again.” 15 The Sumerian and Egyptian concepts of the ME, mes and msche reverberates in the titles Moses (who was rescued from water) and messiah , a term applied to Jesus. This title is another of the powerful code connections Jesus shares with Aton and the Milky Way. He said “hereafter ye shall see Heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” 16 His Crucifixion spilled the heavenly water and blood, 17 delivered the dew and caused millions to see the Light and to call themselves ‘born again’ in the Word or the misty dew . Pulling this thread further, we find that the sacred river in which Jesus was baptized, the Jordan , preserves another connection with Aton and Eridu. According to 19 th century scholar and linguist Godfrey Higgins (1771-1833), the word Jordan is derived from Eridan or Eridanus , and eri means savior . 18 In the code Jordan (Eridan) could easily be Ire Dan . Ire, we recall, refers to ‘instructional or healing"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 75 waters or (f) ires .’ Interestingly, the Dan were the biblical tribe of judges (balancers). When allowing for the interchange between the letters ‘d’ and ‘t’, Eridanus becomes Er-itan or Ire- Aton , and resolves to ‘raton’. The word rat is akin to right , rot and rad (slang for radiation), as well as rod , rate and ray . The word raton or ratoon (ray tune) means ‘to grow new shoots from the root of a plant that has been cut down’. 19 This is precisely what the baptism of the rays of Aton were said to do. They revived the human soul, the seed or plant of the Core, and enabled it to grow new shoots, and be ‘born again’. In other words, when the rays of heavenly dew filled the V Grail cup, they transformed the human from an I to a blossoming Y or . This enabled one to re- Generate , regrow, recover, restore, and refind the Healing Sun within. Without wishing to criticize, it may be said that today’s empty ritual of baptism in water is a “cargo cult” distortion of the original Mystery Teaching. It is akin to the South Sea islanders worhshipping the Coke bottles and other cargo left by the U.S. Army after WW II. Only a journey for knowledge of our original state, evolution and destiny as spiritual beings can restore the true baptism. To the Taoists (‘those of the Way’) the Chinese verb for journey was yu , which originally meant, “to swim” as across a river. 20 In this case, the river is the Milky Way.

SGR A* In the previous chapters I made the case for the existence of hyperdimensional healing energies. The word and symbol plays we discussed, and those that follow, strongly suggest that the ancient Egyptians, Sumerians, Mayans, Chinese and original Christians possessed and shared great knowledge about these energies. They, in turn, deliberately employed it in their symbolism for ultimate purposes that are yet to become totally clear. However, this symbolism forces us to consider that their knowledge was centered on the Way to use these energies for instruction and healing. Skeptics insist that no such healing energy, mist or baptismal fires from the Galactic Core exist, and it is pointless to search for them. How could they know? Unless they knew the Healing Sun code they never would have had the idea to look for them in the first place! It has been my experience that most scientists take a dim view of mythology if they care to look at it at all.

In 1934, two years after Karl Jansky’s discovery of the ‘hiss’ from the Core, French archaeologists in Syria discovered the stunning Goddess with a Vase statue of Isis, the goddess of the Core (opposite). In Syria Isis was known as Mari (‘sea’, ‘love’). Isis/Mari is wearing her Shugurra helmet. Sumerian scholar and linguist Zecharia Sitchin says Shugurra literally means “that which makes go far into the universe.” 1 What kind of a helmet, thinking cap or pair of magic glasses is this?! It may be more than coincidence, or sheer poetry, that Shu-gurr-a resolves to Sgr A , the radio source believed to lie at the exact Core of our galaxy.

We shall return to the story of this pair of magic glasses later for an answer."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 80 Today, astronomy has its eye on the Central Sun of our Galaxy. There has been a buzz of increased interest in the Galactic Core by astronomers recently sparked by the Gemini 8-metre Observatory Project, a multinational collaboration that will provide a twin pair of eyes, magic glasses composed of twin telescopes, one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the South. The Gemini Observatory has been designed to be sensitive to the trickle of infrared radiation from the Galactic Core. In other words, it is designed to see Tula. The first scientific observations from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii are providing a dramatic revelation of some of the striking hidden phenomena at the Galactic Center. Rotating gas rings can be seen there as well as stars travelling at tremendous speed around a massive black hole. What other phenomena await is unknown, but is certain to be the answer to the secret teachings of all the ages. The leap in consciousness that is to follow is certain to be of the magnitude of Galileo’s discovery that the Earth revolves around the Sun and not the other way around as espoused by the Church’s dogma. With a tiny telescope Galileo changed our view of our world. With our two eyes on the Core we will change the view of our universe. Some astronomers argue that Sgr A, this point-like source, or •, reveals a black hole about the size of a large star, but containing the mass of four million suns. The staggering amount of material being drawn into the black hole radiates enormous amounts of energy at many frequencies ‘that go far into the universe’. Indirect evidence supporting the presence of a massive, central black hole is provided by the Sgr A* radio source. Its radiation is consistent with recent theories concerning how black holes form and might interact with surrounding matter."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 81 Theoretical illustration of a black hole. A black hole with a mass and energy of millions of Suns in the Galactic Core? This is a long way from the hiss reported by Karl Jansky. Theoretically, physicists view black holes as time machines that may open gateways to parallel dimensions. They are the subjects of intense scientific research in America and Europe and have led scientists to ponder the mysteries of interstellar passageways called wormholes . In the past few years, the scientifically rooted concept of wormholes and star gates, also called the Einstein-Rosen bridge, have become popular topics of such television shows as Star Trek: The Next Generation and Sliders and movies such as Stargate and Contact which ancient stargate technology for opening wormholes in space/time. Unfortunately, these celestial bodies, due to their small size and staggering gravitational forces, draw in all surrounding materials on a one-way course toward their centers. Therefore, venturing toward a black hole is dangerous business. Not even light escapes its grasp -- hence, the name black hole . The distant cosmic bursts of high-energy radiation from Sgr A were brought to Earth when NASA trained its"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 82 powerful Compton Gamma Ray Observatory on the heart of our galaxy. NASA scientists discovered a fountain of exotic particles spewing from this region. Compton, launched in April 1991 from the Space Shuttle Atlantis , observed high-energy photons known as gamma rays coming from outer space. Of all the high- energy photons beamed at us by the Core, probably none are more puzzling than those emitted in gamma ray bursts. Astrophysicists speculate these bursts are coming from a white hole, a ‘cosmic gusher’ of matter and energy, which inhabits this region. In physics circles it is said that, whatever a black hole can devour, a white hole can spit out. These white holes precisely conform to the image the ancients held of the center of our galaxy. A white hole is a black hole running backwards in time (a negative black hole). Just as black holes swallow things irretrievably, so also do white holes spit them out. Mathematically it was thought that one could theoretically travel into a black hole, pass through a connecting tunnel, and emerge from a white hole in another part of the universe. This concept is perfectly illustrated by the meander tunnel found painted on the Neolithic vase on p. 15. White holes cannot exist, since they violate the second law of thermodynamics. In ancient myths, however, these passageways and fountains of healing energies, called White Heads, were often featured at the domain of the immortals. Among the Compton telescope’s many discoveries was that gamma ray bursts -- flashes that briefly outshine all other celestial objects in the sky -- actually come from unimaginably powerful explosions far outside our Milky Way galaxy. This new evidence suggests that the high- energy photons beamed at us could come instead from distant galaxies, and if so, their sources must be incredibly powerful and wholly mysterious. In 2000, astronomers"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 83 using the observatory’s instruments announced the discovery of a new class of gamma ray emitters located less than 1,000 light-years from Earth, relatively close in cosmic terms. Undoubtedly, the gods who allegedly dwell at the Core would know about this Source. If for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and our premise is that humans are programmed to go back “home,” could this be the reason that physicists were driven to discover worm holes leading to Tula or even to other galaxies? The Hubble Space Telescope has shown us that we live in an ‘ocean’ (or ‘garden’) of over 450 billion such galaxies, each of them with hundreds of millions of stars similar to our own Sun and Galactic Cores hissing with activity. These staggeringly glorious images/energies have prompted scientist/priests and other practitioners to search for the beginning of time and the divine birth of humanity. The word Hubble is worth examining in the code. It is composed of the word elements hu , meaning ‘Shining One’, ‘effervescent one’, ‘God’, and bble , meaning ‘gate’. Combining these terms, Hubble means ‘gate to God’. Unlike Old Testament times, when Jehova destroyed humanity’s Tower of Babel, 3 the tower that opened a gate into the heavens (and separated humanity by language as punishment for building it), God has enabled us to return to the Garden that was formerly closed to us. I think we can replace the old idea of the Tower of Babel with the new idea that it has been retooled as a fancy camera, the Hubble Space Telescope, which has opened the way to God’s Garden. Coinciding with the turn of the Millennium, our telescope beams home healing, “holy water or light” from our neighboring galaxies. Hubble’s discoveries leave us with amazing questions.

Or does G come from a higher, totally unimaginable realm ‘above’ the galaxies? What is more, what is our connection to these galaxies? Is it possible, as physicists speculate, that there are worm holes or cosmic passageways connecting these worlds? Is it possible, as ancient shamans believed, that there are special places on Earth where we can enter these worlds and ‘jump’ galaxies ala the Neolithic vase? One thing is certain, we have only just begun to apprehend the other 9/10 of the mysteries of the Garden in which we live. Our ancient predecessors, on the other hand, seemed to have had awareness of this Promised Land. 2012: THE AGE OF QUINTESSENCE From a mythological perspective, it is impossible to separate the discoveries of modern science concerning Tula from the beliefs and practices of the ancient priests and mythmakers. Indeed, the topic of the Healing Sun code and the sacred energies emanating from the Galactic Core, as well as the possible existence of the black and white holes leading to even higher realms, would be interesting during any time in history. It is particularly interesting to us for according to the Maya Long Count calendar, on 13.0.0.0.0. -- what we call December 21, 2012 -- the Sun will be in direct alignment with the Galactic Core. Maya prophets claimed 2012 will be a moment of new creation resulting in the transformation of our world. To use a term, with which we are now familiar, our world will be ‘born again’. According to the phenomenal work of John Major Jenkins, 4 at approximately the time of Jesus the ancient Maya astronomer/priests proclaimed the existence of a black hole at the Galactic Core. We shall examine the fascinating pictures of Tula Maya science and religion draws for us in more detail as we proceed. Included are"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 85 scenes drawn by Maya artists that bear witness to the existence of a ladder reaching between Earth and Tula, a (star) gate way, powered by the black hole at the Galactic Center. (The Warao Indians of Venezuela also knew this ladder or axis. At the base of a cosmic axis or tree lies a knotted snake that has four heads . At the top of this tree there is an egg-shaped place of shamanic power. 5 ) Correspondingly, the Hopi prophecy is a secret oral tradition of sacred stories that date back 3,500 years (approximately the time of Akhenaton and Moses). Hopis say their prophecy predicted the coming of the white man to America, both world wars, and the creation of nuclear weapons. ! And it predicts that time, as we know it, will end when humanity emerges into the “Fifth World.” There have been Four World Ages, the present being the fourth. The stargate motif is prominent in the story of the transition into the Fourth World and the Hopi prophesied return to Tula in the Fifth World. Hopi Fourth World legend centers on the Ant People. 6 After their world had come out of balance (again Tula is a Sanskrit word for ‘balance’ ), and before its destruction, the Hopi people were told that their inner vision would give them the ability to see a cloud that would guide them by day, a star by night, till they arrived at a certain safe place. Guided by the vision of an open door at the top of their heads they were led into an opening at the top of a big mound where the Ant People lived. In Hopi myth they met a caretaker or gardener named Massaw along the way. He was assigned to the Hopi to help them find their way into this Promised Land. The Hopi say the good-hearted among them, “the peaceful ones,” were led by Massaw to a reed (Tula is the ‘place of reeds’ to the Mayans).

Was Egypt one of these civilizations? Compare the Hopi migration routes (Gs) with the Gs of Neolithic meander tunnel. Does it depict a wormhole?

Those left behind chopped down the bamboo tube and closed the hole O in space. Massaw, whose tracks were symbolized by a , reappeared to the peaceful ones upon their arrival in the Fourth World. He opened up the sky to allow in the light of the Sun, introduced them to corn (maize), and then showed them how to use a farming stick. Corn represented the secrets of the elements, the secrets of life. The Mayan Rios Codex associates Tula with the first production of maize, as does the Popul Vuh , “the bible of America.” At Tula the first inhabitants of the Fourth World grew massive maize crops. Fascinatingly, it was also the habitat of exotic birds. 9"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 88 The farming stick or planting stick is a vital code symbol in our search. It represents the Etheric or El-e- mental world (the source of the Word), a symbolism sustained by the fact that sticks are cut from trees. In esoteric tradition, the vegetative life of trees and plants is supported by etheric ~ energies. 10 The Polynesians called these El-e-mental etheric energies aka , the Egyptians akh , and Cathars called them oc . Akka is the Akkadian name for the Goddess of Akkad who brought the gods out of the Deep. She was the “Water-drawer” and the feminine prototype for Aquarius. Akka is also the Greek name for “She Who Fashions,” the creator of humanity. 11 Here is an important code connection. Mankind, says the Popul Vuh , was made of maize (ME). Hopi indian, Edmund Nequatew, noticed the corn and “germ god” petroglyphs (below) carved on a rock in Willow Springs, Arizona. 12 If the “germ god” is a pre-technological way of saying genes, then we may speculate that maize is another term for DNA, and that corn ( ka-orn ) conceals secret knowledge of the El-e-mental substance from which Akka formed humanity. Genes and memes go together. Perhaps this is why in Sanskrit the word for the universal El-e-mental substance in which all memory (memes) is held is akasha . It is believed that this aka (or aqua) substance can be extended outward in a thread or a rod, ray ~ or stick, as in the story of Moses turning a rod into a serpent. 13"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 89 What does this thread extend itself too? In the Hindu system for classifying the elements, the fifth element (wood or quintessence) Akasa is a black or indigo egg called the Void (Woid or Word). 14 Thus, the aka cord (chord) extends to heaven to bring down the healing tones exactly like Akhenaton’s ankh . This concept of “power lines” is modeled in the petroglyph from Canyon de Chelly, Arizona shown here. In Egypt, the ka was considered the soul’s twin . Two figures are joined by a “power line”. Aka is also the root for the Akashic Records , the Book of Life mentioned in numerous scriptures throughout the world. For example, when John reaches the door to Heaven in the book of Revelation, he is shown Christ sitting on a throne in a rainbow. 15 Beside him is a book with seven seals. 16 This Book of Life is the Cosmic Egg. It contains the seeds of all human thoughts, ideas and actions. What kind of knowledge, exactly, is in this Cosmic Egg? Freemasons say that Thoth, the Egyptian god of magic and the inventor of language who taught the secrets"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 90 of the Inner Light, possessed all secret knowledge on 36,525 scrolls that were hidden under the heavenly vault (the sky). 17 Considering that Thoth was depicted wielding the Key of Life, it is reasonable to speculate that the secret of healing is contained in this databank. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the French Christian mystic and paleontologist, called this Thought Sphere the ‘Noosphere’ (from noe , meaning ‘mind’, and ‘intelligence’). He said that: “All around us, tangibly and materially, the thinking envelope of the Earth -- the Noosphere -- is adding to its internal fibers and tightening its network.” 18 He believed that someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for the second time in the history of the world, man will discover Fire. 19 ‘Nous’ happens to be one of the names by which the early Christian Gnostics referred to Jesus. He was the great mind or ‘spirit of all intelligence’, a soul whose particles were sprinkled amongst all creation. In “The Man in Sapphire Blue,” the German saint, Hildegard of Bingen, depicted Jesus as Nous with the tracks of Massaw leading to Paradise behind him. Interestingly, when Jesus was upon the Cross one of the two thieves who was condemned to die with him is told by Jesus that he will be with him in Paradise. 20 Paradise is widely misunderstood as Heaven. However, to Jesus’ first century AD Gnostic contemporaries (the Family), ‘Paradise’ was the name given to the Fourth Heaven, known also as the House of the Sun. 21 To the thieves, the Gnostic son of the Sun was promising a new beginning as did Massaw to the Hopi.

Herein is contained the inner teaching of Jesus. This Egg is the source of the baptismal or instructional waters , and our souls, said the ancients. It is also, we may conclude from the Hopi corn reference, the source of our DNA. Genes and memes come from the same Source. Nous (from Nu, the Core) or knowledge can be passed on from generation to generation via the DNA and memes because the Cosmic Egg is a Morphogenetic Egg (or ME for short) according to the theory of formative causation. Biologist and chemist Rupert Sheldrake upholds the possibility that all can tune into memories, thoughts, or symbols, from the distant past that are not stored in our brain. 23 In Sheldrake’s Morphic Resonance theory the human DNA molecule plays the role of a receiver, , of all the knowledge, ME or mes , accumulated by humanity. By matching our DNA’s signal (song, tune) with someone who came before us (such as Jesus), or even after us, we can tap into their knowledge. Our interpretation of the code has informed us that the mist of knowledge rains (rings) from heaven in the form of cosmic rays (tones). Undoubtedly, this includes phosphenes. As we can see, our understanding that Massaw’s planting stick is code for the El-e-mental etheric energies or aka has proved to be a vital piece of the Healing Sun code. As the Healing Sun’s intergalactic material, its"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 93 essence ~~ rises in our DNA. As Massaw’s planting stick is akin to the pa’aya rattle , his maize-based code teaching aligns him with E.A. ( Aya ) and his ME tablets. The teachings contained within the maize enable us to manipulate the aka (p)rayer energy from the Healing Sun to heal ourselves and our world. This piece of code is capable of unifying several additional traditions. For example, the planting stick appears in the hand of the Fool, the O card in the tarot deck, another repository of Cathar symbolism. He is the Wayshower guiding us on the ‘wheel of time’, fate and destiny (the Latin rota or Wheel is an anagram for tarot ). In French ‘fool’ is ‘ mat ’, a word that may be traced to the Egyptian goddess of “Truth” and “Justice” Maat or MaMa , code for the Core. Thus, the Fool guides us to the Core. E.A. (and Ak-ka) drew the ME tablets from ‘the Deep’. We can now appreciate that the Deep is another name for the goddess mother Tia- MAT (Holy Maat, or Holy Mother), from whose formless body the universe was born at creation. 24 The terrible cataclysm that E.A. responded to was the splitting of Tiamat (a story we will attend to momentarily). She is the original virgin. In Latin, the word stick is virga , a sound that is close to virgin, hinting that the planting stick of Massaw was a fertilizing stick similar to that carried by the Fool. Separating the peaceful ones into groups, Massaw asked them to choose ears of corn. Each group greedily went after the choicest-looking corn leaving only a single cob of short blue corn. This blue corn was the favorite of the humble leader Massaw. The Hopi chose it. 26 The mockingbird, or hopi-yaaba , provided the Hopi with a new language, 27 the Language of the Birds, the code of the Galactic Core. Massaw then gave them rules for"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 94 living a balanced way of life. And he gave them a prophecy that told of a time of trial, suffering and purification before a time of “One-Heartedness,” a Fifth World that is to come. This will be the world of the “ Quint-essence ,” the fifth essence or fifth element. When he returns, say the Hopi, Massaw will bear a Green Stone. Correspondingly, the Holy Grail is called the Emerald Tablets or Emerald Cup by the followers of Thoth, and the Green Stone by the Cathars of Southern France. It is the (S)tone or Key of Life. Some Hopis believe their prophecy roughly coincides with the Mayan 2012 prophecy. The Hopi tradition says the years after 2012 could be a Golden Age with humans at peace and in harmony with nature. During this time our powers of manifestation will increase because our hearts and minds, our thoughts and actions, will more and more be the same (they will be in “synchronicity”). Astrologically, this new age is called the Age of Aquarius (or Aka Ray Is ), a time highlighted by communication and symbolized by two parallel wavy lines ( ), a symbol of E.A. These two wavy lines symbolize cosmic water. However, they could also symbolize waves of frequency or vibration, the light rays of aka . Simultaneously, the two wavy lines could represent the heart and the mind. Normally separate, perhaps they will be united into a helix, or 8, the symbol for the caduceus, the twin snakes wound around a central rod. When the cosmic egg divided itself into Heaven and Earth from the tension caused by the two serpents it created the Axis Mundi -- the I pillar situated at the center of the world, holding up the heavens and connecting it with Earth.

The Hindus were among the first to place the twisting serpents within the body. They identified seven chakras, plexuses (knots) or energy centers strung throughout the human body. The Hindus relate chakras or vibration centers with flowers. The cultures of the Maya and Hindus converge into one with the similarity of the words chakra and the slightly modified Mayan word chacla , which refers to the Milky Way in its graphic form and movement. When we analyze the Mayan word lol , meaning, “flower” we find it is related to lil – “vibration.” Lillies were used to signify the chakras. The energy flow within follows the ‘spiral or corkscrew effect’ found governing organic growth, and as we will see, the serpentine energies of the Core. The ‘nagas’ serpents are represented as currents inside the human body. One of these currents is masculine the other is feminine. Frequently, it is said that the head and the heart rule these currents respectively. As noted, the electromagnetic frequencies (rays) emitted from the Core transmit coded information and interface with, or are planted within, the helixes or twisting 8’s of our DNA and central nervous system. We will explore the ancient promise that if we can connect with the energies of the Healing Sun we will become bridge builders between Earth and Heaven, or what the Hopi call peaceful ones or Peacemakers .

The ancient Hopi sign that a transition into this New World was to begin was the ambiguous yet magnanimous landing of an eagle. The eagle is known the world over as the symbol of apotheosis associated with the sun god. 27 The word Apotheosis , the ritual of “god making,” comes from ap , ‘far away’ and theos , ‘god’. 28 The apo root appears prominently in Apo-stle , the name of Jesus’ messengers. Ant-Inomianism was the general term for Christian sects who followed the doctrine of Apotheosis, believing they could become “one with Christ.” 36 In the code these sects are the Ant People of the Hopi, and ‘the Family’ of Jesus. The eagle also was connected with the rites of calling down “fire from heaven.” The eagle was, therefore, often identified with the firebird, thunderbird or phoenix. The Egyptians called this bird the heron . Remember that the Mayans called Tula ‘the place of herons’. In Egyptian myth, at the dawn of the world, the heron or ben-noo (bird of resurrection) emerged from the Central Sun (Tula) •, crossed the waters of Nun (or none, O), and alighted atop the floating Pillar of A-tum 30 which had mysteriously appeared at Heliopolis, the City of the Sun, in the Black Land, Egypt. The Egyptians regarded the heron as a cosmic emissary, the embodiment of the Divine Word . From its outstretched arms it would radiate light and then deliver a teaching designed to transform humans into herons (or light beings).

The interchangeability of heron, and hearon or heeren , ‘to hear’, reinforces the auditory nature of this teaching. Indeed, the conjunction of the symbols of the heron, the Word (Key, ) and the I Pillar takes us to the heart of Egyptian Galactic Core religion. These code symbols will be revisited again and again as we proceed. Significantly, the Greeks called Heliopolis Ultima Thule or Ultima Tula . 31 It was also called the ‘City of 8’."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 99 Located just across the Nile from Giza and the pyramids, Heliopolis was a subterranean center of Egyptian religion. Also known as the city of the Phoenix, and called On or An in the Bible, 32 it is a place of enormous mystery. The focus of the Egyptian Healing Sun religion was the Temple of the Phoenix where was housed a sacred object called the ‘Benben Stone’ . 33 The ‘Benben’ was the egg of the phoenix or heron. It was a mysterious conical stone that the Egyptians said came from the Celestial Disk. It was the “celestial chamber” in which the gods landed on Earth. The god Ptah built a museum around it and ancient Egyptians, like modern Muslims who visit the extraterrestrial black stone at Mecca, flocked to Heliopolis to view this object. 34 In The Crystal Sun , 35 researcher Robert Temple notes that the ancients, including the Egyptians, held the image of the Cosmic Egg as a crystal ball. The soul descended from the place where the zodiac and the Milky Way intersect. It is protracted in its downward course from a sphere , its divine form, into a cone . This deep metaphysical light-theology, as Temple describes it, that images the soul as a tiny cone of light being emitted from the gigantic ‘crystal sun’ derives from Egypt and was carefully passed along the Greek mystery schools, including that of Pythagoras. Jesus taught the exact same principles. For example, in the Pistis Sophia he explicitly teaches that “those who receive of the mysteries of the Ineffable or who shall receive of the mysteries of the First Mystery, -- they become flames of light-beams and light-streams and penetrate all the regions until they reach the region of their inheritance .” 36 The interchangeability of the heron and the thunderbird illuminates this phenomenal piece of code. It renders the cone or egg shaped Benben Stone as the stone of the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 100 thunderbird, or ‘thunderstone’. An important Greek word for ‘thunderstone’ is baitylos . In Latin it is bae-tulus . Temple traces the origin of this word to the Egyptian baa , ‘metallic substance’. Another provocative meaning of baa , which fits perfectly with our theory, is ‘ the material of which heaven is supposed to be made ’. 37 These holy (s)tones were imbued with extraordinary powers. They were endowed with the power of self-motion, they could move through the air, and they were used as weapons systems. Towns and fleets could be captured by their means! Archaeologists have uncovered a small-scale stone replica of the Benben depicted here with a god (or a goddess?) at its open hatch door beckoning with a welcome gesture. The striking similarity in appearance and, no doubt, function of the ben-ben (left) to today’s Apollo command modules (right) is certainly thought provoking. In 1969, the prophecy of the return of the heron or eagle was fulfilled for the Hopi when the first words spoken by man on the moon were: “Houston... this is tranquility base. The eagle has landed.” The eagle was the name of the ben-ben-like Apollo command module."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 101 In 1979, believing the end times had arrived; the Hopi began releasing their secret prophecies. They believe that in order to preserve human life we must discover the Great Spirit’s Life Plan as spelled out by the prophet Massaw and work to uphold it. Otherwise we will be destroyed by fire. The Holy Bible offers the identical prophecy: ! “ . . . the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” 38 Many interpret these prophecies to mean a fire from a nuclear detonation will destroy the Earth. Indeed an ancient prophecy that greatly disturbs the Hopi may explicitly refer to the atom bomb: ! “s ome day there will be a road in the sky and a machine will ride this road and drop a gourd of ashes and destroy the people and boil the land . ” ! Employing the code, a more hopeful interpretation of these prophecies of the ‘heavens passing away’ and of a ‘great noise’ emerges: that of a new vibratory rate that does not burn, but rather will cleanse and purify the Earth. Some stories say it even brings ecstasy. Such purification could be called ‘fire’ since it is directly connected with magnetism, vibration, frequency, ~, cosmic rays, etc. The new civilization created by these fresh rays will, in this way, arise phoenix-like, from the ashes of the old. In code this book is about the return of the heron, and the rediscovery of the place of herons, a long-forgotten source of healing energy.

The benefit of this effort is practically immeasurable. In ancient times navigators were forced to hug the coast from port to port. It was only after the discovery of the North Star in the heavens above that they were able to venture into the deep seas. Today, with the rediscovery of Tula we will be able to venture deep into the Cosmic Ocean. We can scarcely imagine what awaits us. To repeat, the Hubble Space Telescope has shown us that we live in an ‘ocean’ (or ‘garden’) of over 450 billion such galaxies, each of them with Galactic Cores hissing with activity. There are great discoveries yet to come as we venture into this uncharted realm. One of the areas slated to benefit from these voyages of discovery is medicine. Another area that will be nurtured by these developments is religion. As the code unravels itself before our eyes and clues emerge, we will see how all the world’s great religions are founded upon and united by the principles of the Healing Sun and the idea of a hole in space leading to a Promised Land.

If we have learned one thing it is that in order to connect with the Healing Sun we need a Wayshower and a Y Shower, a baptism in the wisdom of the Waters of Life. The preceding chapters have, I hope, provided a taste of this experience. We have seen how the Wayshowers E.A., Akhenaton, Moses and Jesus shared the Healing Sun code. Now let us further unravel this code with the Wayshower and physician-god Asclepius, whom the Greeks associated with Isis, the goddess of the Core, as our guide. Mythologically speaking, Asclepius (A-SKILLY-pee- us) is the son of Apollo (whose name means ‘stone’) and the goddess Coronis. According to the Greeks, Apollo, the brother of Athena, came from Hyperboria, the Greek name for Heaven ‘beyond the north wind’. At its center was a mecca for learning called Tula . 1 The Greeks said that from the center of Hyperboria – Tula • -- Apollo would pull the strings of his seven- stringed lyre ( lira) , his golden harp (which undoubtedly was tuned to the Key of Life), and seven rays of ak (keys, tones, serpent waves, i.e. ~~~~~~~) would alight from Tula. These seven tones formed his hissing Choir. In fifteenth century “Music of the Spheres” drawing on the next page, Apollo sits on his throne with his lire in hand.

I have identified this Sun as Tula. From Tula our souls emanated along with Truth, Light and Love. Tula is the world of causation while the material world we live in is the world of effects . The intellectual world or soul world is the world of mediation . Thus, Christ, who came from the Central Spiritual Sun, was called the judge or ‘balancer’ of the three worlds. A very strange sight was recorded in AD 51: three suns were seen at once in the sky. This happened again in AD 66. On February 28, 1648 a man named Jeremiah Shakerley witnessed the same phenomenon in England. William Lilly included an illustration of the event in his Astrological Predictions from 1648-1650. 6 The Three Suns or Three Heads in a rainbow. As Shakerley describes it: 7 “On Monday the 28th February last, there arose with the sun two Parelii , on either side of one; their distance from him was by estimation, about ten degrees...

Above that, in a clear air, appeared another conspicuous Rainbow, beautified with divers colors... ” Jermemiah then leaves us with a most astonishing observation: “ At or near the full Moon, they vanished, leaving abundance of terror and amazement in those that saw them .” A similar rainbow phenomena may be found in the story of Apollo (the ‘stone’), the hero of Tula. When Apollo was only four days old at Pytho he battled a female serpent which molested his mother during her pregnancy. This serpent was known as Sol Niger or Black Sun. (S)laying this energy, or re-veiling it, Apollo renamed it Pytho ‘Delphi’ meaning ‘womb-like’, and became the ‘Spirit of the Pit’(read ‘Nut’ or ‘Core’) giving oracles. In securing or hiding the rays or waves of this Black Sun underground, it appears to me that Apollo may have been placing it in the safe womb of Mother Earth to make use of it. To the smiths, and their later descendents, the al- chemists ( Akka mists ), this ‘serpent’ was the guardian of the Philosopher’s Stone, a stone fallen from heaven.

In West Africa and in Australia, the Pytho or Black Sun is known as the Rainbow Serpent. Astronomer Dr. E.C. Krupp notes that the Australian Aborigines say the Rainbow Serpent helped sculpt the land into is present form during the mythical “Dreamtime” of the world’s beginning. 10 In Arnhem Land, she is the primordial “mother of all things.” This description of the Rainbow Serpent draws our attention to Eve (Ova or ) who the Bible says was the “mother of all living”. 11 The rain-bow was called her necklace, says Barbara Walker, of which she made the bridge to heaven for the souls of her chosen ones. 12 In Norse mythology, Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, connected this world with the realm of the gods. This may explain why Thales of Miletus said water ~ was the first cause or arche . Wherever it appears, says Walker, this glowing bridge was a yellow brick road for the chosen, a razor-edge for the fearful. The Buddhist scriptures, the Katha Upanishad , said the Rainbow Bridge to heaven is as difficult to cross as the edge of razor. The Persians said exactly the same thing of their Cinvat rainbow bridge, adding the crucial detail that this bridge is at the ‘ Center ’... ‘ the bridge connects Earth and Heaven at the Center ’. 13 Likewise, according to some accounts, individuals from Hyperboria, that mysterious place that is home to Tula, founded Apollo’s temple at Delphi. It was considered the Center of the universe (Tula), and the meeting place between Heaven and Earth. 14 It was designed to house the serpent, and was the stage upon which its choir performed."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 110 The meaning of the word Choir is well known in English as the most sacred part of our churches. Choir is also core , the celestial place from which the music of Apollo emanates. The words carol (kar-ol), a song, and chorus (kore us), singing together, are related. The French for chorus is choeur , pronounced like coeur (cure or core), meaning heart . It is likely that sing , song and sung have everything to do with the Sun . His training at the Heart or Core and the seven sonic blooms he made with his lyre earned Apollo the title of god of light, music, harmony and lyrics (or lyr-ocs). According to poet and mythologist Robert Graves, the seven strings of Apollo’s lyre were connected with the seven notes of the octave (the eighth being a repetition one octave higher of the first) and the seven vowels of the later Greek alphabet. 15 They were given mystical significance and used for therapeutic music . As we have noted, the code says they are healing tones. Correspongingly, the Gnostic Gospel of the Egyptians says the Divine Word of power (delivered to Egypt by the heron) emanated from a Great Light (that would be Tula) along with seven powers (rays), which are the seven vowels: I,E,O,U,E,A,O. The word of power ( hekau) , the Name of God which is not to be spoken, is derived from these seven vowels. It is written on a “tablet” near the “throne of glory,” which we have identified as the Cosmic Egg. In French the Language of the Birds is called ‘langue des oiseaux’. The word oiseaux , or bird, is one of the rare French words which contains all the vowels A, E, I, O, U. The connection to the bird language may explain why it is that each spring Apollo would return to Delphi in a chariot drawn by white swans."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 111 While at Tula Apollo also gained the sacred skill of resurrecting the dead through the blood from the side of the goddess of justice . The important question, who is this goddess of justice through which Apollo healed, has already been answered. It was Lat , the name of Apollo’s mother. In Greek myth, Zeus was Apollo’s father. His mother was Queen Lat or Latona , the mother of the World Egg and the Sun who was a Titaness. Lat is an anagram for Tala or Tula . 16 As Tula is a Sanskrit word for ‘balance’, which embodies the concept of justice or judgment, this makes it reasonable to conclude that Tula is the source of the healing ‘blood’. It was through the serpentine channel that the essence ~, L- atone -a, or Blood of Life of the Core could be transferred to Earth. The next important question is what, exactly, is this ‘blood’? Is it the metallic stone of the heron called the bae- tulus, ‘soul of Tula’? To answer this question let us continue to explore the story of Apollo and his son, Asclepius. If he came from (or through) the Core, as these myths suggest, this may explain why Apollo was called Karnean or Carnean , words suggestive of the heart ( car ), core and carn or corn . 17 In fact, the name KORE meant the Virgin Goddess throughout the ancient world, and is likely the source of Asclepius’ mother’s name, Coronis or Koronis . Astronomically, Asclepius (whom the Romans called Ophiuchus ) is the constellation nearest the Galactic Core, lying only a few degrees from the mathematically determined center of our galaxy. He is called the Serpent Holder. The star representing the foot of Asclepius is the next closest star to the Galactic Center. Though invisible to the naked eye the designers of the zodiac apparently knew the location of the Galactic Core. Of the twelve astrological sign glyphs (thirteen including"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 112 Asclepius) the signs for Sagittarius and Scorpio are the only two that feature arrows, and both are beside each other. The tip of Sagittarius, the Archer’s arrow is the orange colored star Gamma Sagittarii. When arranged as they appear in the sky, the two pointers face each other. In between Sagittarius and Scorpio is a ‘missing’ thirteenth constellation -- Asclepius . In full appreciation of this piece of the code, Dr. Paul LaViolette, its discoverer, concludes that the arrows of Sagittarius and Scorpio appear intended to point to Asclepius as the constellation nearest the Galactic Center. 18 Who knew this in the ancient world? And how did they know it? One group was the Cathars. In their secret watermarks an ox is seen with the serpent of Ascelpius wound around a cross or a Tree of Life. From the serpent’s mouth emerges three circles bound together. This symbol is called the trefoil , the emblem of the Trinity. Notably, it is the symbol for the fifth element, Wood (the Word), also known as quintessence. The letter A is coming from the ox’s mouth. This is vital code. An ox head symbolizes aleph in the Hebrew alphabet. Aleph stands for the Uncreated, En Soph (‘wisdom’) of the Sepher Yezirah , the mystical Hebrew Book of Creation . It is the Word or El-e-mental Life Force, G , energy upon which the World is constructed. Its mystic meaning is the unification of spirit and matter."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 113 Cathar ‘ox’ watermarks. The serpent of Asclepius winds around crosses on both marks. As revealed in the Gospel of John: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.” 19 We could easily substitute ox for Word. Ox is phonetically interchangeable with ocs and ak(s) . The letter ‘a’ is obviously the heron hieroglyph, further linking the Ox with the Language of the Birds. In Tibet the ox is called a yak. To repeat, the Mayan Sages defined language as y’ak , which when inverted (as is common in the code) reads k’ay , meaning “song.” The healing serpent of Asclepius, the Cathars are telling us, is a channel for the kay , key, note or the song of life from the Core (choir). In this context there are a number of curious facts that need to be pointed out. One is that when a human baby comes into the world its first cry, no matter what its timbre or volume, has as a rule the frequency of A. Another is that"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 114 those people who have “perfect pitch” relate other notes back to A. 20 The sound of A is then a kind of yardstick human frequency. It is also known that the average distance between the human eardrums is an exact fraction of the wavelength of A. The wavelength of A is 78 centimeters. Divide that by four and you get the distance in question (19.5). Interestingly, A-432 is also the piano tuning used by Mozart (whereas the pitch in modern tunings has been raised to around 440). Musicologists often speak of the healing quality of his music. His special tuning may be one reason why. In Indian mysticism the universal seed Sound is announced as Aum or OM . And in Pythagorean thought A (432) was identified as the ground tone . 21 Another wonderful illustration of the linkage between the cosmos, the stars Above, and the cosmos Below, the human body, is provided by Joseph Campell and found in the time cycles recorded by priests in the Hindu tradition. 22 The present cycle of time, the Kali-Yuga , is 432,000 years. This number appeared in the writings of the Babylonian priest, astronomer, and historian and Berossus in c. 280 BC. Berossus recorded that the interval of time between the establishment of the first city, Eridu, and the disastrous Flood that destroyed the world (as described in the Book of Genesis) was 432,000 years. This suggests a complimentary message in both cultures. When we turn to the inner cosmos of the body we find a striking correspondence. In physical fitness circles we find the belief that a physically fit person, one who exercises regularly, will have a resting heartbeat of about 60 beats per minute or less ...

Times 24 hours, equals 86,400 beats per day. The Language of the Birds was used to decode the wisdom (the Word ) spewing from the Serpent in the Tree of Life. Adam used it to exert control over all the elements. Interestingly, says Godfrey Higgins, the a or A is the first letter of the Tree of the letters (the Tree of Life). This tree was called elm , which is why in Latin the letters of the alphabet are called ‘elementum’, and why the word El-e-ment stands for the first power, the first word or force which constitutes all physical matter. This tree bore on its trunk all the tree of letters in which were concealed all sacred knowledge and wisdom, including control of these elemental forces. Control of these forces is the goal of all occult or metaphysical endeavor. The ‘branches’ of this El-e-mental tree were its teachers, the Skilled Ones who provided the occult instruction that enables us to control these forces. One of these teachers was Pythagoras for whom the Y was named. The Y we recall held the energies of the Cosmic Egg. It is said that as he grew older, Pythagoras’ physical powers increased. What did he discover that enabled him to achieve this remarkable re- Generative ability? Was it simply a body posture ? For an answer let us turn to Asclepius, another of this tree’s branches. THE GREAT PHYSICIAN According to Greek mythology, Asclepius was a Great Physician. The Greek poet Homer describes him with all the attributes of a man. He was a god-man. (Interestingly,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 116 kor is a round vessel, and an old Hebrew measure of capacity; a homer ). King James I described Asclepius as “a mediciner after made a god.” It is of great interest to note that he was the chief physician aboard the Argo . When the ship’s voyage to recover the Golden Fleece, the symbol of wisdom, was over he became so skilled at his practice that he even restored the dead to life. 23 Asclepius’ ability to restore life fits with the meaning of his name, derived as it is from the root elements A , scl , ‘skill’ and pius ‘good’ or ‘sacred’, and meaning “A Sacred Skill.” Interestingly, the Language of the Birds was called argot after the Argo . Once he learned the code Asclepius could apparently work the Mystery of the misty baptism, the Y Shower whose irradiating ‘ rain ’ (in German rhein means ‘to flow’ and is the root for rhythm ) brought new life. A vital Tula connection with this skill is made in erion , the Greek word for ‘woolen fleece’. 24 Erion reduces to eri, savior of On. This explains why it is similar to heron with the addition of an (‘h’). In the Aenid (‘nine’) the great Roman poet Virgil describes the arrival of this Great Physician, who with his sacred skill animates the dead and brings down thunder: Hail, Great Physician of the world! All hail. Hail, mighty infant, who, in years to come, Shalt heal the nations, and defraud the tomb! Swift be thy growth, thy triumphs unconfined, Make kingdoms thicker, and increase mankind. Thy daring art shall animate the dead, And draw the thunder on thy guilty head; And then shalt thou die, but from the dark abode Shalt rise victorious, and be twice a God."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 117 The connection Virgil makes between Asclepius, his head and his pure skill of animating the dead contains a scintillating piece of the code. This slice is illumined by the Mayan name of the Pure One; she was Lady/Queen Great Skull-Zero. Correspondingly, the Hebrew Zohar calls Tula En Soph ( souph means ‘wool’). The first emanation from Tula is called the “white hidden fire in the White Head (hole?).” 25 White means ‘pure’ and is related to ‘pius’ and ‘sacred’. Skull is, of course, another name for Head, where our wisdom or skill is processed. This symbology is used in the book of Revelation where Jesus’ head is described as white as wool (suggesting pure ‘fleece’ or ‘wisdom’). Connecting these dots, it appears that in this case the wisdom of the White Head refers to O, the Cosmic Egg to the Mayans. When we add all these together, they point to one conclusion: The Cathar Pure One and the Mayan Lady/Queen Great Skull-Zero is Tula. Asclepius’ skill at resurrecting the dead came from Tula. The physics theory of white holes or cosmic gushers provides additional possible reasons why the ancients ascribed healing power to this region of the galaxy, and to the chain of Great Physicians or Sacred Skilled Ones who mirrored this archetype. It is important to note that there may be more to the symbol of the serpent-holding god- men and women and the area of space named after him than meets the eye. In fact, Asclepius may not be holding a serpent at all. This may be a code symbol for something far less simple and far more phenomenal. THE SECRETS OF THE SERPENT SOUL Applying the techniques of the Language of the Birds to the word ‘serpent’ reveals important linkages. For example, the biblical term for “serpent” is nahash ,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 118 meaning snake and blood. However, it comes from the Hebrew root NHSH, which means “to decipher, to find out.” The Hebrew word for soul, nashamah , comes from the same root. Where we see the image of a serpent we are encouraged to take a leap of the imagination and see blood and souls. When allowing for the seemingly off-key interchange between the Hebrew words for serpent , soul and blood a provocative question arises: did Asclepius, the ‘serpent holder’, who also is the ‘soul holder’ and ‘blood holder’, decipher or find out the secrets of the soul? If so, it would certainly be a very sacred skill and would link him with the Core. ‘Serpent Holder’, ‘Blood Holder’, ‘Soul Holder’, ‘Secret Holder’, these are all perfect descriptions of Tula. Ancient wisdom traditions maintain humans, and all other beings in our galaxy, emanate from and share a common home: the Galactic Core. The mythological and religious texts contain indications that the Egyptians believed in what may be described as a “World-Soul,” which they called BA. 26 Once released from its holding tank at the center of the galaxy, say the legends, souls fan out along four rivers. As above. So below is one of the best known of all metaphysical truths.

If God formed humanity in the Garden, and Tula is taken for the Garden, then the Eden, the region surrounding the Garden that is fed by the four rivers must be our Milky Way Galaxy. In Genesis, 29 one the river (of souls) is called Hiddekel , which is a copy of the Akkadian name of the Milky Way, Hiddagal , or “River of the Divine Lady.” 30 The Hebrews are not alone in thinking of the Milky Way this way. The Nordic Edda confirms the four streams of souls came from a central fountain -- in the home of the gods.

The Sun Cross, like the six pointed Seal of Solomon (the star of Israel or Jewish star), the Chinese ying-yang symbol, the Mayan Hunab Ku, and the number 69 which has two opposing spirals, shows the forces of expansion and contraction, or the duality of love and fear in a state of harmony.

What many ancients noticed (including the Mayan, Hindus and Tibetans) was that, during the spin toward the light, we spiritually ‘awaken’. During the spin away, we fall spiritually ‘asleep’. For the past 2,000 years we have been in the most asleep point. The 26,000-year cycle, called the Precession of the Equinoxes, is divided into twelve New Ages of approximately 2,150 years each. We are presently leaving behind the Age of Pisces the Fish introduced by Jesus and entering the Age of Aquarius ( Aka ), symbolized by the Water Bearer. Its glyph is two wavy lines representing water, frequency, light or vibration. The phenomena of the Precession was allegedly first detected by Hipparchus in 127 BC.

THE UNION OF THE COSMIC MOTHER There used to be sacred centers called ‘Tulas’ spread throughout the Earth where the thread linking the earthly and heavenly Tulas were connected, the eye of God was opened and the Word appeared. The ancient Anasazi ancestors of the Hopi left a prophecy that suggested Tula would reappear on Earth. This infers the return of the link to Heaven. “Come to the City of the Future,” says the Anasazi invitation. “Tula shines in all her glory. Here are buildings unlike those we build, yet they have a breathless beauty. Here people dress in materials we know not, travel in manners beyond our knowledge, but more important than all this difference are the faces of the people. Gone is the shadow of fear and suffering, for man no longer sacrifices, and he has outgrown the wars of his childhood. Now he walks in full stature toward his destiny – into the Golden Age of learning.” These lines leave little doubt that the Anasazi conceived of Tula as an actual place -- and a very advanced place at that.

As in past ages, this will be a time of the changing of the gods and the revelation of the Healing Sun. Jenkins found Maya statements that say on the December 21, 2012 the Sun would enter a “birthplace doorway” to the Core. 2 When he looked at Maya texts discussing the Creation event, Jenkins also found mention of the phenomenal concept of a hole O in the sky. Noting that some Maya place names operate on the As Above. So Below law, hinting that Mayan astronomy and mythology go together, Jenkins observed astonishing references in Mayan art and place names that correspond to the concept of black holes. One such glyph translated to mean “black hole” plays an important part in Creation events and king-accession rites, i.e. the “changing of the gods,” says Jenkins. In every instance they refer to the location of events that happen on December 21, 2012. 3 Specifically, the black hole glyph corresponds to the “dark-rift” in the Milky Way near the Galactic Core that, according to modern astrophysicists, contains a black hole. The Maya made recurring mention of a ‘Night Sun,’ a ‘Black Sun’ with dark rays shooting out in all directions. 4 When Earth was tethered to this Sun and one of these doorways opened the gods would descend to Earth on what the Maya called ‘serpent ropes’, bringing with them knowledge from on high. 5 As astronomy and mythology go together, so too do astronomy and anatomy.

The Sumerians, says Sitchin, described this hidden world in gardening terms. It was a verdant planet of life that they called Nibiru or NAM.TIL.LA.KU, “the god who maintains life.” NAM.TIL.LA.KU (literally “Name of Shining God is Tula”) was the “creator of grain and herbs who causes vegetation to sprout... who opened the wells, apportioning the waters of abundance” -- the “irrigator of Heaven and Earth.” 6 The dwellers of NAM.TIL.LA.KU were called An- nun-naki (“the 50 who went from Heaven to Earth”), 7 a name that bears more than a little resemblance to the Hopi Anasazi , who prophesied about Tula. Additional names for this heavenly world were A.SAR.U.LU.DU meaning “lofty, bright watery king whose deep is plentiful.” It was always referred to as a radiant planet, and depictions of it show it as a ray~emitting body, says Sitchin. 8 Based on its mythological lineage, its symbol, its proximity to Tula, its name, and its description we may safely speculate that NAM.TIL.LA.KU likely is a crossing point or gateway to Tula if it is not the Galactic Core itself. It was called “the Planet of the Throne of Heaven.” 9 Perhaps it is the “bulls-eye” for souls seeking to return to Tula, or passing through this gateway to enter any of the other 450 billion-plus galaxies in the larger Garden.

This Lord or Sun God with the fertility goddess Anat as his muse, symbolizes his return and activity after his death and confinement in the underworld by building a temple. Later in the story, Baal, who is another form of Apollo, calls on a divine craftsman named Kathar , called ‘ the Skilful and Percipient One ’, to construct his temple. 12 This may be the earliest use of the term Kathar or Cathar. It extends the definition of Cathar to ‘Skillful One’ and possibly extends the lineage of this soul group to Sumeria. The culmination of the construction of the house is the opening of a roof-shutter. This event forces a confrontation with the Skilful One (Kathar) who urges its installation. When the Skilful One opens the window the clouds open and the rain (rhythm, keys) falls. He furnishes Baal with a double mace with which to “drive the sea from his throne” (or capture its essence ala Akhenaton). The double mace is often shown with entwined serpents.

These ‘Companions of Horus’, the Egyptian Sun God, notes Andrew Collins, who made a careful study of these Elder Gods of Egypt, taught the secrets of the phoenix, the science of the pole or pillar of the eliptic , as well as the concept of the Great Year. 15 In The Gods of Eden Collins tells of the amazing exploits of these early gods of Egypt who lived during the sep tepi or the First Time. 16 The events surround the ‘Is- land of the Egg’, a mound or island that rose out of the Nile waters in the area of Heliopolis, Giza and Saqqara, all now within site of the Great Pyramid. This Island was referred to as the ‘homeland’. 17 It is here that the first god-ruler called Pn , or “This One,” identified by the priests of Heliopolis (Tula) as A-tum, established himself. He founded his throne in a sacred “Field of Reeds” (Tula is the Mayan place of reeds), upon a radiant lotus, symbolic of the rising of the Healing Sun.

We are told a valueable ‘relic’ survives the conflict with the enemy serpent, the Djed pillar . 21 It is stored in a temple complex beside a ‘field of reeds’, situated beside the waters of Nun. 22 The companions of the Divine Heart locate and retrieve the sacred books and the power tool (the Djed), which the Edfu texts tell us had been stored underground in the “deep place that is constructed.” Around this pillar or Tree of Life a new civilization arises. 23 A new group of eight beings appears. 24 The new Egg is called the Underworld of the Soul and becomes the first resting place of the Osiris, the green-faced Egyptian savior and god of gardening. 25 His hieroglyph includes the Djed pillar which houses a ‘serpent’. We will explore the Djed in more detail later. The Djed hieroglyph. In the nineteenth century the famous Inventory Stela, was discovered on the Giza Plateau by French Egyptologist Gordon Maspero.

The mystical concept of the two humps refers to the Gateway to the Core where the Healing Sun rises. Like Mount Moriah in Jerusalem, the Great Pyramid complex is honeycombed. The pyramids mark the location of a massive subterranean facility. After traversing its inner (subterranean) chambers the intitate comes faced to face with the original point of First Creation and ben ben stone , the Cosmic Egg. 30 The Edfu texts say this Egg of Creation was the ‘embryo’, or ‘seed’ which was viewed as the ‘nucleus’ of the power objects used inside the inner chambers by the 8 gods. 31 The Djed was included. 32 As noted, this egg featured the ‘Great Lotus’ or ‘throne’and gave off a radiance. 33 The word lotus is an anagram for tulos itself derived from Tula(s). As we can see in the depiction above, someone once believed that the Giza machine was designed to capture the knotted serpent energies. Might these serpents represent the ‘divine radiance from the heart of the divine’ 34 that the Edfu texts say this Egg (or the Galactic Core) radiated? 35 Were they captured by the Djed atop the Great Pyramid?

As noted, the discovery of the gateway to the Healing Sun is the goal of all esoteric practice. It is at the core of every religion. Including Egyptian. Why not a gateway to Tula in Egypt at the Great Pyramid, arguably the single greatest monument on Earth? Our Mayan studies revealed that earthly Tulas were ‘docking stations’, places on Earth where the knotted ‘serpent rope’ opened up and nine gods emerged. We have even seen an apparent representation of this ‘rope’ in the Mayan depiction shown earlier, and now again at the Pyramid. By any measure, creating this Egg was a breathtaking engineering feat. Few visitors to the Great Pyramid consider the outstanding marvel they are standing on when viewing the supposed tomb of the pharaohs (where not a single mummy has been found). There are many legends depicting the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx (the Lion, Bull, Man, and Eagle) as “markers” or concealers of a mystery even more perplexing than the markers themselves, perhaps even an immense underground facility. The Great Pyramid sits at the exact geographical center of the landmasses of Earth. Scientists point out that this dot (•) of real estate is also the center of the ley/gridwork system that covers the Earth. Ley lines are invisible rivers or highways of electromagnetic energy.

It is vitally important to note that the Stau-Ros cross is a symbol for something else, and to identify what, exactly, the original Tau Cross was will up the ante in our quest immeasurably. One clue comes from Pan. It is said that Pan haunted the groves ( grooves ) of Arcadia (Atlantis/Tula), amusing himself by playing a flute and inducing terror and panic in travelers without apparent cause (the origins of the word ‘panic’ come from Pan).

Simultaneously, it may also reveal why the Egyptians and Mayans were so hot to build a bridge to Tula.

There is a school of thought that says the Mayan 2012 date represents the end of the world as we know it. Dr. Paul LaViolette is an astrophysicist who discovered high concentrations of cosmic dust from the Galactic Core in Ice Age polar ice . 45 In 1983 Dr. LaViolette presented startling evidence to the scientific community indicating polar ice shows signs of major galactic core outbursts occur approximately every 13,000 - 26,000 years and more frequently for lesser events. 46 Dr. LaViolette notes that humankind has survived numerous “ galactic superwave ” catastrophes as he calls them. 47 As he reported in Earth Under Fire , the human race nearly met with extinction at the end of the last ice age during a protracted terrestrial cataclysm that was triggered by the arrival of cosmic rays from an explosion of our Galaxy’s core. The result was a frigid Earth. His predictions about the entry of interstellar dust into the solar system were confirmed ten years later in 1993 by the Ulysses spacecraft. 48 In his books and on his website, 49 Dr. LaViolette warns that another such volley may be imminent. He outlined a gripping argument that the ancients encoded warnings about this event in myth, esoteric lore, in the tarot and in the tales of the constellations. 50 These stories provide frightening warnings that the outbursts from the Core produced alternating periods of searing heat and mountainous floods followed by frigid cold that only a few survived."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 144 As Dr. LaViolette describes it, preceded only by the wave-flash from the initial explosion, the Core emits cosmic rays that escape from the Core virtually unimpeded. Travelling at near light speed they form a spherical shell radiating outward through the Galaxy. 51 Astronomical discoveries subsequently confirmed aspects of Dr. LaViolette’s shocking hypothesis. In 1985, astronomers discovered that Cygnus X-3, an energetic celestial source of cosmic rays, which is about the same distance from Earth as the Galactic Center, is showering Earth with particles, traveling at close to the speed of light, moving in essentially straight paths. 52 These findings are reason to be gravely concerned about the effects of a Galactic Core explosion because they imply that the cosmic rays generated can impact our planet, virtually without warning. 53 RESURRECTION This is not a book about the end of the world by a catastrophic outburst from the Galactic Core. Rather, it is a book about the use of Core emissions for healing. That is, this is a book about cosmic genesis or re- Generation rather than cosmic genocide. It is about the rebirth of Earth. My primary reason for believing that waters emitted from the Core are beneficial comes from the Maya who believed our world would be reborn, in a sense “resurrected,” “saved” or “born again” in 2012. This implies that new knowledge will emerge that will enable us to escape catastrophe. I feel that the phosphenes research demonstrates that this knowledge is delivered in the cosmic rays of the Healing Sun.

Therefore, their"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 145 Galactic Core science, embedded in mythology, can be of great assistance during this time. As de Santillana and von Deschend propose in Hamlet’s Mill , “Mythology is the work of science; science alone will explain it.” However, as we go into the study of the coded material the greatest source of knowledge concerning these times will come from within us. The frequency of our souls and the tuning of our DNA are strongly related to the place of our origins. Placing oneself in alignment or balance with these energies can stimulate personal healing and the evolution of our species. Studying the code and the ancient myths of Galactic Core enables us to find the center of ourselves and to become co-creators of Heaven on Earth. Speaking of prophecy, the whole idea of the wisdom, tone, or frequency emanating from the Healing Sun and of a person placing themselves in balance, judgement or atonement with it is encoded in the story of INRI, the name-title Pontius Pilate nailed to the Cross above Jesus’ head. 54 This term is both a title and a prophecy. The Bible says it means “Jesus the Nazarite King of the Jews.” In the Gnostic tradition, however, INRI means Igen Natura Renovatura Integra ; “by fire nature is renewed whole,” pointing to Jesus’ role as a deliverer of higher frequency knowledge or ‘fire’. In the Book of Revelation, the return of INRI triggers a thousand years of Peace, or the rebirth of Earth. The Rosicrucians, whom we will study in the next chapter, altered the meaning of INRI to IGNE NITRUM RORIS INVENITUR or “the baptism or cleansing power of dew is only discovered by fire.” This ‘dew’ is also the same as duv (dove), the alchemical secrets of Sophia ( wool ) as taught by Christ.

Some of these influences are positive. Some are negative. Modern science is confirming their knowledge. By way of positive example, let us turn to 1987 when a hot blue super giant erupted into a supernova making world history, and front-page news all over the world. This is significant because this supernova appeared in the constellation Asclepius. An intense blast of neu trinos raced ahead of the shock wave. These subatomic, massless, chargeless particles streamed through the Earth, south to north, along the Earth’s magnetic force lines. “Far from being an isolated event, far distant from Earth and incapable of having an effect on us,” writes science writer Donald Goldsmith, 55 “SN1987A (the 1987 supernova) can be seen as the latest in the chain of events that shaped our solar system, our Earth ourselves.” “In a very real sense,” says University of Illinois astrophysicist Larry Smarr, 56 “we are the grandchildren of supernovas.” As Harvard professor of astronomy, Robert Kirshner, says “generations of supernovas created the elements we take for granted -- the oxygen we breathe, the calcium in our bones, and the iron in your blood are products of the stars.” 57 We are composed of the same ‘star stuff’ , the same energies ~, as the rest of the universe.

It accepts the seeds emanating from the Core so that they can flourish. Periods during which the “sparks of light” are available are “highlighted” by supernovas. For example, the previous Mayan baktun (calendar period of 144,000 days or 394 years) stretching from 1224-1618 AD has been called the “Baktun of the Hidden Seed,” the “hidden seed” being interpreted as an expansive civilization cycle. 59 The beginning and ending of the baktun were literally “highlighted” by supernovas: one in 1230 AD and Kepler’s supernova in 1604 AD -- the last one visible to the naked eye. Both supernovas appeared in the constellation Asclepius , which means their energies came through the ‘lens’ of Asclepius. One group who attempted to unravel the code of the Mystery of the healing energies of the Galactic Core, and the supernova eruption of 1604, was the Rosicrucians.

The prophecy of Nostradamus apparently fulfilled. The Rosicrucians were no mere simple secret society. This brotherhood, which blossomed in France, Germany and England in the early 1620’s, 2 claimed to be a link in a continuous chain of immortal beings from a superior race that possessed the secrets of alchemy and the Philosopher’s Egg or Stone (the Holy Grail), could converse with angels and make themselves invisible ( phantoms ). 3 Where did their name come from?

However, as we will see, the Rosicrucian’s roots can be traced deep into antiquity first to the Coptic (Egyptian) Christians of the Rose-Cross in Alexandria, then to Jesus, Akhenaton, and finally to Isis, the goddess of the Core. The secrets of the Rose Cross were revealed at the Crucifixion, the event in which Jesus (INRI) produced the Blood and Water of Life. In the code the cross of Rosi- crucian is actually the (C) ross of Life, the Flower or Rose of Life. The nature of the Rosicrucian secrets is revealed in the Latin words rosa (rose) and ros , meaning ‘rain’ and ‘dew’.

The fact that flowers blossom by unfolding like a Y has caused them to be chosen as symbolic of spiritual unfoldment.

After the Crucifixion of the Light of the World, the religion of the Cross of Light , the seed of Gnostic Mystic Christianity, arose from the ashes of the Library of Alexandria and Egypt. Alexandria, a university town in Upper Egypt, was home to the famed Library of Alexandria, which was overseen by the goddess Isis and her consort Sarapis. The secret alchemical knowledge at the core of Isis’ teaching was focused on two effects: the production of gold and spiritual immortality. The priests of Alexandria closely guarded these ancient nuclear secrets. At Alexandria the Madonna, Isis, was renowned as an alchemist. Coptic or Egyptian Christians attempted to preserve the inner core of Isis’ alchemical wisdom. They did so by combining the ancient Egyptian symbol of the Key of Life with the Christian symbol of the Cross + to create the Rose Cross, the Cross of Wisdom or Light. The walls of the Coptic (Egyptian Christian) Museum in Cairo plainly portray the metamorphoses of the Egyptian ankh symbol of Isis into the mystic Christian Rose Cross. 11 By the second century AD the Rose Cross was established as a symbol of all the esoteric mysteries concealed within Mystic Christianity. The code of the Rose Cross is indicated by the character to the right on the opposite page, the symbol of the Sun Goddess and her son Mercury (the Roman name for Thoth). The cross at the base represents the volatile human body. The circle with the point in the center represents the ‘head’ and the Sun.

In writing of the Rosicrucians Harold Bayley interprets the words “dew” and “cross” as alluding to “the honey-dew of knowledge rising and falling again on the souls of men in odourous showers from the well of Truth .” 12 The Rosicrucians, he says, were understood as “a very secret society of learned men” described as “physicians in the highest sense of the term, because they aim at restoring the bodily powers of man through the action of the soul, fed by Divine wisdom and knowledge.” 13 It is with such statements of re- Generation in mind that we interpret the immensely powerful Rosicrucian illustration from 1618 (next page) as a depiction of the human body as a castle.

A Brother visited those who lived their lives in balance with its precepts. Waite explains that Imitation is the work of all true Christians as well as the Brotherhood. It results in the purification of the spirit, and glorification of God on Earth. It is called the right eye of the soul , by which the soul looks into the eternal. The Brother bears the left eye, which looks toward time. Though invisible to the naked eye the College of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood recognized the appearance of the supernova of 1604 in the alchemical illustration shown here from 1618. The inferred reference to the Sacred G lasses in the Rosicrucian Imitation alerts us to open our eyes concerning this illustration. In the upper left side of the drawing we see a man holding a serpent representing Asclepius riding on a beam of starry energy. The supernova’s date 1604 is beneath him. On the right we see a goose. This “goose” is evidently a visual pun for “goost,” the ancient term for the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost ( goost ). In the Roman zodiac the goose, the sacred bird and symbol of the goddess Juno (the root of January) was used as a symbol for the constellation of Aquarius. 14 Dr. LaViolette observes that the stream of water which Aquarius pours down from the heavens may have been a symbol for the interstellar dust and ice that once poured into the solar system. They are the etheron particles that form the transmuting ether. 15 In Hebrew, Aben means a stone. Ab means father and ben means son. Where the Father and Son are present there the Holy Ghost must be also. Therefore, the goose or Ghost symbol may be a symbol for the arrival of the Holy Stone. In this case the goose represents the heron. The Stone in question are the healing tones of Tula."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 158 Another explanation for the goose symbol may come from Hindu mythology where, Brahma, the Supreme Being, is depicted riding upon a goose.

Another name for Astarte is Anat and Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. 17 As in the illustration shown opposite, this Goddess of Heaven rides through the stars on chariots of swans and geese. According to the remarkable theory of panspermia , the ‘goose’ represented stellar energies that originally seeded the Earth with life and continue to do so today. Panspermia, literally “seeds everywhere,” states that life on Earth was seeded from space, and that life’s evolution to higher forms depends on genetic programs that come from space. Starting in the 1970s, British astronomers Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe ignited modern interest in panspermia, a notion that dates from the time of Socrates. By careful spectroscopic observation and analysis of light from distant stars they found new evidence, traces of life, in the intervening dust. 18 Hoyle and Wickramasinghe accepted the fact that life on Earth evolved over the course of about four billion years. However, they say that the genetic programs for higher evolution cannot be explained by random mutation and recombination among genes for single-celled organisms, even in that long a time. The programs, they say, must come from somewhere beyond Earth. In nutshell, their theory holds that all of life comes from space. They also proposed that comets, which are largely made of water-ice (crystal), carry bacterial life across galaxies and protect it from radiation damage along the way. In a sense, these comets are Mother Goose’s -- i.e. Isis the Core’s -- Golden Eggs.

It is now universally accepted that space is a “soup” that contains the “ingredients” of life. This development could be the first droplets of a huge new wave of scientific discovery. Beginning in the fall of 1998, even NASA’s public position on life-from-space shifted dramatically. On January 4, 1999, NASA officially recognized the possibility that life on Earth comes from space. On March 19, 1999, NASA scientists announced that two more meteorites hold even stronger fossilized evidence for past life on Mars. On April 26, 2000, the team operating the mass spectrometer on NASA’s Stardust mission announced the detection of very large organic molecules in space. Non- biological sources for organic molecules so large are not known. On October 19, 2000, a team of biologists and a geologist announced the revival of 250 million-year-old bacteria, strengthening that case that bacterial spores can be immortal. On January 28, 2001 NASA announced that tiny “bubbles” that can build themselves in the freezing vacuum of space suggest that life, or the seeds of life, could have originated out in the cosmos. Scientists managed to get artificial cell membranes to form. The membranes, which resemble soap bubbles , could act as primitive cell walls. Organic compounds from interstellar space were found to “self-assemble” into soapy, water-repelling bubbles. Scientists concluded that the molecules to make a cell’s membrane are all over space.

Obviously, the Rosicrucians were inclined to accept the ancient theory of panspermia. They documented the infusion of invisible life-giving energies from supernovas and associated them with Asclepius, and hence, the vicinity of the Galactic Core. The Rosicrucian physicians appear to be indicating that they mastered these energies. This cosmology can be traced to the philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus, who envisioned the cosmos as a living organism that lived and died like any living being. When the universe dies, said Heraclitus, it leaves behind a seed, from which the New World grows or re- Generates . Originally, all matter came from a single basic substance , which Heraclitus viewed as a kind of fire . “For Fire all things are exchanged,” he wrote “and Fire for all things, even as wares are exchanged for gold and gold for wares.” 19 The object of Earth life, according to the Rosicrucians, was to allow the “seed” of God to be implanted in our inner garden and blossom. In numerous ancient Mystery Schools and philosophies we find this insistence upon the presence and existence of a One primordial El-e-mental substance , the One Thing ~ ~, of which all else are manifestations or re- Generations .

THE RAY HOLDERS The Healing Sun code found in the Rosicrucian symbolism links this order to the Egyptian heretic king Akhenaton. As noted, he introduced the religion of Aton, the Monotheistic religion of the Central Healing Sun, that he called Aton , or simply ‘the Disk’. He is frequently depicted receiving the Key of Life from Aton. It is vital to note that the symbolism of Akhenaton was descended of Thoth, the Egyptian god of magic and writing. Beginning in as early as 196 BC with the Jewish writer Artapan, Thoth-Hermes was amalgamated into the story of Moses. 1 In the Greek mysteries, Hermes is shown, exactly like Thoth before him, with this rod of power in hand translating souls between dimensions. Probably the best known work attesting to the assimilation of Thoth into the Moses mythology is in a ‘book in stone’, the Siena Cathedral. In one of the images engraved between 1481 and 1498 on the white marble floor-slabs is a depiction of Moses as a magician. At his foot it says: “Hermes Mercury Trismegistus, contemporary of Moses.” This appellation leaves little room to doubt that Moses was equated with Hermes."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 164 Hermes walks on water with his caduceus and lyre in hand.

As Hermis it means ‘stone of Is’ or ‘Stone of Isis’."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 166 Moses causes water to gush from a rock with his wand. In addition to their common symbol, the rod or ray of power or light that gave them command over the elements, two major events are the likely inspiration for the interplay between Hermes/Thoth and Moses. One of these was the discovery of the Jewish Kabalah, especially after the Diaspora of 1492. The second was the rediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum , the books of Hermes, brought to Florence, Italy in about 1460 by a monk traveling from Macedonia. 2 The ideas contained in the Hermetica had a profound impact on such Renaissance scholars as Ramon Lull and Giordono Bruno. They regarded Thoth/Hermes as the Egyptian Moses and upheld his works as sacred texts equivalent in stature to the Holy Bible. 3 The appearance of the Hermetica led to the discovery that the Sun and not the Earth lies at the center of the solar system. As this new Sun rose , the dawning of the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 167 Renaissance and the Enlightenment of the late 1600s followed. Thus, the Renaissance is attributed to a re- Generation of the secret teachings of Thoth. This was just the beginning of the realignment with the truth spawned by the Hermetica . In 1937 an aged Sigmund Freud, inventor of psychoanalysis, published a controversial article in which he pointed out near identical points of contact between the new Egyptian religion introduced by Akhenaton and the new teaching concurrently offered by Moses. 4 Freud wrote: “The Jewish creed says: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lore thy God (Adonai) is one God.” Freud argued that the ‘ai’ can be removed from the word ‘Adonai’ since it is a Hebrew pronoun meaning ‘ my ’ or ‘ mine ’ (my italics added). Doing so, we are left with ‘Adon’ (Lord), which as Freud demonstrated is the Hebrew word for the Egyptian ‘Aton’ (the Egyptian ‘t’ becomes ‘d’ in Hebrew). The name of the God of Moses, Adon, is identical to the name of the God of Akhenaton, Aton. Freud’s article touched off a firestorm of criticism from Jewish elders who feared acknowledgement of the Moses-Aton code connection would undermine the ethics of Judaism and undermine the love-hate Egyptian-Judeism feud. Freud died within months of the release of Moses and Monotheism , his book that brought the name Akhenaton out of the darkness of history and into the light of the 20 th century. It forced scholars to evaluate the contribution of the Egyptian Heretic King in the formation of Jewish monotheism. Fifty years later an Egyptian-born historian named Ahmed Osmon, author of Moses Pharaoh of Egypt , 5 made a clear argument for what Freud had hinted at, but stopped short of, proclaiming: that Moses and Akhenaton were one and the same person. Osman’s revolutionary case was strongly supported by archaeological and historical evidence. This time the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 168 backlash came from the Muslim leaders. Osman, an Egyptian-born Muslim, was proclaimed a heretic by the followers of Mohammed. Egyptian Muslims viewed his book as a blasphemy in the sight of God. The book was burned in the streets of Cairo. 6 Though it is not widely known, when we continue to pull this thread we learn that the first Christians believed Jesus acquired Akhenaton’s Key of Life, using it to perform many of His miracles. ! Aton is a word play for a tone or a tune . Aton is also the root for Adon or “Lord,” a title later given to Jesus. Like Adonis, the Lord Christ died and rose again in oscillating cycles . His rebirth, notes Barbara Walker, was a sprouting from the womb of the Earth. 7 At Easter time sacred pots called kernos or “gardens of Adonis” sprouted wheat or millet. 8 The early Christian belief that Jesus possessed the Wayshower or conductor’s ray, branch or wand, as well as the I pillar, was profusely demonstrated in their characterizations of him found in the catacombs of Rome shown here.

Vatican Museum It is crystal clear from the connection between the titles Aton and Adon and the continuity of the depictions of Thoth-Hermes, Akhenaton, Moses and Jesus above that the secrets of the Healing Sun had something to do with music (tones or keys) or rays. These were the secrets adopted by the Rosicrucians, who apparently subscribed to the panspermia theory, and symbolized Tula by the Rose Cross."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 171 It also suggests Jesus may have perpetuated or reinterpreted the Egyptian teaching of not only Moses, but also Thoth and Akhenaton. In his well-researched work, The Head of God , Keith Laidler lays out a compelling argument that Jesus was even descended of Akhenaton. 9 All of these links affirm Jesus’ connection to the religio-science of the Core and the secrets of the Healing Sun. However, there is more. Once detected, the cosmic ray and Tula connections are easily discovered in the story of Jesus. For example, when, in the Bible, Zecharia prophesies that the Lord will be carried into Jerusalem on an ass he uses the word ATHON , so close to ATON . In Hebrew the male ass is called the hamor (‘H-AMOR’), the she-ass ATHON. 10 It would make a staggering difference if the Hebrew scribes, fond as they were of word play, used the word athon as a pun for Aton or a tone, the Key of Life. It would suggest that Jesus floated into Jerusalem on a ray of light ala the way the Holy Ghost floats in the Rosicrucian drawing, and the way Hermes floated above the waters. The word Madonna , the Virgin Mother, also preserves an excellent example of how the code was connected to Jesus. It is literally Ma-Atonna or Mother Aton. This aligns the Madonna with Latona, the mother of Apollo, and also preserves a hidden Tula connection. Bethula , the Old Testament word for virgin , literally means “house or vessel of Tula.” It is interchangeable with baetulus . In connection with Massaw’s planting stick, we noted that, in Latin, the word stick is virga . Spliced together, these pieces of code hint that our DNA is the vessel of Tula, or that cosmic stones (of Tula) can tune our DNA. Both thoughts are in tune with the theory of panspermia. The bethula connection explains why, for the earliest Christians, the cross + symbolized the center of the universe, the Core, prefigured by the tree of Paradise which was surrounded by four rivers before the beginning of"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 172 time. As the Gnostic Acts of John records, the true cross -- the Cross of Light or Rose Cross -- is a celestial principle sometimes called Logos (the Word), sometimes Nous (Mind) sometimes the Christ. 11 It is the atomic El-e-mental essence ~ of the Cosmic Egg. This essence, we are asked to consider, travels to Earth in the form of a serpentine channel and is found in the soil of the Earth. A famed chapel near Edenburgh, Scotland called Rosslyn derives its name from Rose-line or Roseline , which is thought to be a symbolic representation of the blood or bloodline of Jesus. 13 In the code, however, an alternative explantion arises . The Rose-line would indicate a place on Earth where the soil is saturated with the holy wisdom (s)tones of the Healing Sun, the Rose Cross. As we have seen, Massaw, or the Messiah’s, planting stick reveals the secrets of cultivating this essence. Curiously, at Rosslyn Chapel we find the famed Apprentice Pillar, a magnificent pillar with entwined serpents sculpted around it which make it resemble DNA. This assumption sheds profound new light on the fact that the baptizer and Wayshower of Jesus, John the Baptist, is made to be the reincarnated prophet Elijah. In II Kings, Elijah stood on the banks of the river Jordan and ‘ took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters, and they were divided .’ 13 In addition to being a cloak , the traditional interpretation of this symbol, in geology, the mantle is the soil covering the bedrock of the Earth. 14 In anatomy the mantle is the cor tex, 15 the thin layer of the cerebrum, the main part of the brain which is divided into two"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 173 hemispheres. A mantle is anything that cloaks, covers or conceals. 16 When Elijah lifts the mantle he is playing the role of the Revealer (ala Phanes). Shortly after crossing the Jordan there appeared before Elijah a chariot of fire, and horses of fire. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into a ‘hole’ in heaven •. 17 Awestruck, his companion, Elisha, took up the mantle (soil) of Elijah. 18 Upon his return his companions thought he possessed the Spirit of Elijah. 19 Using the mantle he received from Elijah (left), Elisha parts the Jordan waters (center); later, he curses jeering boys, who are devoured by bears (right). Webster’s traces m ant le to manus , a hand, and tela , a web. 20 This symbol clearly relates to the fact that all thought recorded in the mantle of the brain results from the intercrossing or weaving of impulses of synapses. This word, tela , returns us to Tula and forces a question. Is there a cloaked layer of energies – a Rose Line -- from Tula in the Earth that is lifted or revealed by her Wayshowers? Can these same energies be woven in such a way that they light up the brain?"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 174 We shall attend to these questions shortly. First, we need to weave in a vital piece of code from Sir Isaac Newton, one of the Rosicrucians who pulled back a layer of secrets of the Healing Sun. Most of us have heard the story of Newton’s discovery of his theory of gravity though the auspices of the falling apple. If our understanding of this genius is limited to this fact we are in for a surprise when we learn the rest of this man’s remarkable story as told in Michael White’s remarkable biography Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer . 21 White begins by telling us that The 100 , a listing of the most influential people in history, ranks Isaac Newton number 2 -- after Mohammed and ahead of Jesus Christ. 22 As his biographers often state it is no exaggeration to say that almost all modern scientific achievement can be traced to the English mastermind. Though he is widely known as the creator of empirical science and the modern rational mind, less widely known is that Newton developed these mind sets while immersing himself in the occult code of the Healing Sun. Isaac Newton’s private writings reveal he was an alchemist, and a Grail quester in search of the prima materia , the El-e- mental essence ~ of the Cosmic Egg. To Newton, the prima materia was the substance at the heart of all matter, and the Holy Spirit of alchemy (which he believed was mercury ), suggesting he believed it was an ethereal as well as a material substance. It was buried in the Earth. Newton made extensive studies of Hebrew scholarship, Christian prophecy, ancient and modern theologians and alchemists. He became convinced that Christianity had departed from the original teachings of Christ. Newton was raised as a Puritan. 23 But like many great thinkers before him, he was convinced that the Christian religion covered-"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 175 up the secrets of Creation . He believed in the existence of an advanced pre-flood science that was a grand synthesis of all the mysteries. Its secrets were buried beneath sand, sea and a veil of ignorance after a global cataclysm. These secrets had once been in the possession of skilled beings that gave them to humankind. Newton took it upon himself to uncover them and return humanity to its former state of advanced knowledge. One possible reason for the suppression of Newton’s mystic leanings may be the extent to which they reveal his devotion to Arianism , a heretical sect that denied the Holy Trinity, which Newton considered blasphemy against the true religion. 24 Cambridge was a Christian college. In his acceptance of financial help to continue at Trinity College, Newton twice skirted signing the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican Church, agreeing to embrace the ‘true religion of Christ’ and its accompanying worldview. Privately, Newton decried the authority of the Pope. Like all Puritans he saw no biblical authority for a Pope. When offered the prestigious Lucasian Professorship in 1669, which would guarantee his security and a place in the history of mathematics, he was put between a rock and a hard place. Newton refused to take the Holy Orders. Instead, he applied personally to King Charles II for a special dispensation. 25 In preparation for what he was certain was going to be a protracted theological battle, Newton developed counter- arguments to the Church’s version of the Trinity. Newton traced this “blasphemy” as he called it to the Council of Nicea convened in 325 by Constantine I. During this pivotal council, at which many of the tenets of Christianity were formalized, a ferocious debate erupted between two Alexandrian priests. Arius, who proclaimed that God and"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 176 Christ were separate entities, represented the first Alexandrian school. According to Arian doctrine, Jesus was immortal and the ‘first created’ (the Seed or Cosmic Egg), but he stood somewhere between God and man. 26 The Bishop of Alexandria, Athanasius, who argued that God, the Holy Ghost and Christ are of the same essence, represented the counter-view. The council voted in favor with Athanasius. The Arian view became heresy. The Nicean Creed was adopted originally in the following form, but has been amplified since: We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things, both visible and invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Only begotten of the Father, that is to say, of the substance of the Father, God of God and Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, both things in heaven and things on earth; who, for us men and for our salvation, came down and was made flesh, was made man, suffered, and rose again on the third day, went up into the heavens, and is to come again to judge both the quick and the dead; and in the Holy Ghost. From the year 325 A.D. on, every departure from the beliefs of the state church about Jesus was considered a state offense. Those Christians who retained connection to the original Gnostic teachings of Jesus were persecuted. This forced these teachings to go underground. The mantle of the Healing Sun, like the cloak Jesus wore at the Crucifixion, was lost or hidden. In his writings concerning his Alexandrian research, including the 800-page “History of the Church,” Newton concluded that the Devil behind the cover-up of vital scientific knowledge concerning the original Christ essence or Christ substance ~~ was the Roman Catholic"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 177 Church. It was the duty of every Christ-loving individual to seek, uncover, and decode the alchemical secrets of creation and encode them within themselves . 27 Newton held tight to the notion that the deciphering of humanity’s secret true past, which he called “alchemical history,” was his first and foremost duty, if not destiny. Calling this search his “duty of the first moment,” Newton ranked it higher in his destiny than revealing the secrets of gravity and light. Newton searched ancient Egyptian and Sumerian texts and the Bible for the alchemical codes of creation. “ The changing of bodies into light, and light into bodies, is very comfortable to the course of nature, which seems delighted with transmutations ,” wrote Newton. Far more than turning lead into gold, Newton was interested in the secret of transmuting the human being into a being of light, i.e. an El or L. Like the Family, Newton believed Christ was a man beyond man, a meta- man (or ME-ta- man) who possessed powerful transformative knowledge, but not God. During the early 1700’s after more than thirty years of research, Newton began to formulate his conclusions concerning Christ’s light body: “He had after his resurrection such a body as he had before his incarnation. And therefore as his (natural) mortal body by the resurrection became an immortal body, so his immortal body by the incarnation became a mortal one. And it is easy to believe the one as the other.” 28 During these latter years Newton refined his view of the body of the meta man. Was he a light being who could take on a physical body, or was he material? The answer for Newton was that he was a light being, or phantom, who could toggle -- materialize, dematerialize -- between dimensions. 29 This view is most certainly upheld by Paul’s experience on the road less traveled. Sometime between 1715 and 1725, Newton concluded:"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 178 “He who by his resurrection has changed his mortal flesh into immortal spiritual body might by his incarnation change his immortal spiritual body into a body of flesh.” 30 Newton stated his belief the Christ was a Holy Spirit (a Seed or seeds ) who continuously incarnates (flowers) or arises throughout history. It was these beliefs that kept Newton from taking the holy orders required by the Lucasian chair. Fortunately, the Church of England was more flexible than the Catholic Church in these matters. Much to Newton’s surprise King Charles II readily issued a royal decree excusing Newton from the necessity of taking holy orders! Actually, to prevent this being a wide precedent, the decree specified that, in perpetuity, the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics need not take holy orders. (The current Lucasian professor is Stephen Hawking.) By the time of his death Newton’s library contained 169 books on alchemy and chemistry. 31 Among these books was a copy of the Rosicrucian Manifesto published in The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity R.C. Newton’s own published thoughts on magic and alchemy run into the millions of words. Shortly before his death he burned a number of his papers. Biographers have labeled these words the obvious production of a fool or a knave. A Fool indeed. One can only contemplate what kind of a world we would live in if serious scientists and historians spent as much time as Newton cross-fertilizing the concepts of science with alchemy instead of deriding the past and concealing the beliefs of history’s greatest minds. Of course, this paradigm shift would result in a re-writing of human history.

It was atop the mysterious Mount Moriah in Jerusalem that Hiram of Tyre constructed Solomon’s Temple. We note that without the vowels the name Hiram is H-R-M, which is the root for the name Hermes (who is Mercury to the Romans and is the ~~). Moriah is honeycombed with subterranean passages. In esoteric Christianity these passages lead the way to the core of the Earth where, a thousand years after Solomon, the Christ Rays , or the Rose Line, would penetrate. It is worth noting that the ‘tunnel flap’ of 1996 was just the latest in a string of agitations to the Arabs, Jews and Christian people who fear a Holy War will follow the recovery of whatever is stored underneath the Temple Mount. Solomon built a maze of hidden passages beneath his temple rivaled only by the tunnels that honeycomb the twelve-and-a-half acre megalithic platform upon which the Great Pyramid sits. The Temple Mount passages are said to be tube-shaped with their walls sheathed in large bricks, as if designed to channel water. This may point to the power source for the Temple and explain why Ezekiel heard the sound of great water rushing when in the presence of the Lord at this same site. The ancients claimed that when the geomagnetic and other energetic forces interacted with the water it created a place where Heaven and Earth meet.

Was raising one's personal vibration, or the vibration of the Temple Mount, possibly through water, a requirement for stepping through the gateway to the Center of the galaxy? If so, this makes it clear why Newton described the heart of Solomon’s Temple as “a fire for offering sacrifices (that) burned perpetually in the middle of a sacred place.” He visualized this fire as the focal point around which the apostles centered themselves. Newton called this assemblage the pyrtaneum . He characterized the way it symbolized the working of the cosmos by saying, “the whole heavens they reckoned to be the true & real temple of God & therefore that a pyrtaneum might deserve the name of his temple they framed it so as in the fittest manner to represent the whole system of the heavens .” 32 The Holy of Holies of Solomon’s Temple that housed Newton’s fire was a thirty by thirty-foot square room. (These dimensions are the exact same as the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid.) Its floor, four walls and ceiling had been lined with the pure ‘gold’ of Op-Hir, weighing an estimated 45,000 pounds, and riveted with golden nails. The room was constructed to house the Ark of the Covenant. It sat in the center of the room and contained the Tablets of the Law, the Pot of Manna, Aaron’s Rod that Budded and the Brazen Serpent of Moses. Over the centuries these sacred power tools were lost. Pyrtaneum means “fire of the House of Pure Tan ( tone in the code).” Tanis was another name for the goddess Astarte , the biblical Astoreth for whom King Solomon built his temple. Astarte was another name for the Mother Rainbow Goddess of the Arc, Nu . Pyra comes from Pyrrha. Her name means “ fiery red .” 33 She was the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 181 Pure Goddess of the Cathars. She and her husband, Deucalion, the Greek Noah, magically created human beings from stones and repopulated the Earth after the Flood. The stones of Noah (Nu-ah) may be the same as the dust of the soil from which Adam and Eve were created, and the Blood of Life. 34 In the code Pyrrha ( Purr A ) may have been the magic alchemical (s)tone or the mantle of Tula that a rose embodying the secret for creating the Blood of Life. If my connection of these myths to the word pyrtaneum is accurate, Newton’s naming of the pyrtaneum points to his knowledge that the Grail was a special type of blood achieved when the energies of the Galactic Core are lifted from the soil and flowing through us. Newton may not have been the first to recognize that the Grail (S)tone creates the Blood of Life. However, he may have been a pioneer in his belief that the disciples (the planets) gathered themselves in a circle about the central fire (the sun ). Instead of seeing these planets as forces racing away from the center (Christ-ula), Newton might have visualized the Sun (Son) as a force attracting them toward its center (Core). This concept would be fully embraced by Newton in the 1680’s when he published the Principia . In the code, the story that Newton’s discovery of the force of gravitation came from a falling apple is proved a fairy tale (unless it was a blue apple). It came from his search for the secrets of Christ and Solomon’s Temple. What other foundational ‘science myths’ are actually fairy tales?

THE DNA GATE TO GOD In the fairy tale “Jack and the Beanstalk,” a young boy, seeking to fulfill the needs of his destitute mother (symbolizing the wounded Earth and her fall from Tula) climbs to a heavenly world to discover a new source of abundance (the energies of the Healing Sun). The central conflict of the story emerges when Jack, who is portrayed as a Foolish young boy, sells the family cow for food, but instead of buying food he buys some magic beans. Outraged (or secretly knowing that ‘beans’ were believed to contain ancestral spirits, the L gods), his mother throws the beans in ‘the garden’. As the mother gets back to her harsh reality, Jack looks out and sees a towering beanstalk stretching to heaven and growing in his backyard. Jack scurries up the beanstalk, outwits a giant, steals a hen that lays golden eggs, along with bags of treasure, and a magical harp, and brings prosperity and joy to his family. And then the Giant shows up. Jack is the archetypal Fool. I was therefore not surprised to learn the story of Jack and the Beanstalk finds its precursor in the story of a figure of which we are already familiar, the verdant Green One of Knowledge. Mythologically speaking, the Green Man -- or the Gardener -- is the forest or garden healer, a fertility hero, who typically is depicted with vegetation spewing from the mouth of his severed head. This vegetation symbolizes the re- Generative Word of God."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 184 This description precisely matches NAM.TIL.LA.KU, the verdant provider of agricultural abundance of Sumerian lore. William Anderson, author of the Green Man: The Archetype of our Oneness with the Earth , 1 notes that the Greeks recorded the Green Man is the immortal ruler of Hyperboria, the Greek name for heaven. At the center of this never land is a mecca for learning called Tula . In the code, Jack’s ‘beanstalk’ is the ‘serpent rope’ or Ladder of Heaven. It is a soul-bridge to the Healing Sun. According to the Bible, the term ‘giant’ stands for a race of beings, including Jesus, who were offspring of divine fathers and human mothers. 2 They are the An or An-nun- aki to the Sumerians and the Tit- Ans , or giants, to the Greeks. The key to their power was that the Titans died only when they wished to. Here is the twist. ‘To die’ meant to take on a human body. ‘Life’ was centered in “the immortal blood of the goddess.” That this life-giving blood was the rays of the Healing Sun, Tula, composed of ‘infinitesimally fine filaments’ (to use one of Mr. Anderson’s phrases) was shown earlier in the story of Apollo, and in the story of the Island of Two Flames (Tits) . In another Greek story, Thor journeys to Giant- land to learn the secrets of the giants’ (the An’s) ancient magic (of the Core). In order to do so he crossed a river of the giantesses’ menstrual blood and the serpentine umbilical cord. Returning to the earlier analogy concerning the Garden of Eden (the Egg matrix) and the human body (+), the Gardener’s earthly Garden is the human body. The umbilical cord ~ is the ‘vine’ that once joined Earth and Heaven. The ‘magic beans’ out of which it grew is DNA.

It is through these holes that the soul makes its entrance and exits. The Knights Templar, who recovered a portion of the secrets of Solomon’s Temple, viewed the garden or matrix of Earth life as an 8x8 or 64 square checkerboard. 64 is also the number of codons in human DNA, and the number of petals of the sacred Egyptian lotus flower of A- tum. The object of the game played on this board was to get to the other side and capture the opposing King. The secret subject of stories such as Jack’s was the knowledge of how to transform us into an El (a Shining One) and make L’s or right angles in hyperspace, and get to the other side of life’s checkerboard. In chess, the L is called a Knight Move since Knights move in L’s. That is, they move two squares and take a sharp turn. In the story of Peter Pan (who wore green tights and is named after Pan, the god of the All or L), Never Never land or Neter-Neter land (neter is Egyptian for gods), is ‘second to the right and straight on till morning’. Following Peter’s instruction we form an L. THE COW THAT JUMPED OVER THE MOON One of the most instructive examples of the belief that our DNA contains a link to the Core is found in the story of the goddess Kore, whose name comes from Ka and ore . Ka-Ore also known as Kowr is phonetically similar to words we are, by now, quite familiar: Kor , Ker, Car, and Core. Before examining Kore’s story it is vital to draw from the wisdom of her name embedded in its phonetic relation to the word cow (another element in Jack’s story). The transit from Earth to Heaven (Tula) is made through ‘the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 186 gateway of the Sun’ . In ancient Egypt, the cow, Nut , symbolized the mother of the Sun (Son). The Cow-goddess Nut. Nut means ‘core’, and is the root for such words as nu clear, nu rture, nu rse . In addition, cows were seen as symbols of the container of the waters of Heaven, the Core. 3 The Egyptian story is one of numerous traditions featuring Four Rivers of Paradise characterized as four streams of ‘milk’ that flowed through the galaxy from the four teats of the white, horned, milk-giving Moon-cow . 4 The cow connection is quite intriguing from the Healing Sun point of view, raising remarkable issues. The Egyptian kau (pronounced “cow”) is the root for ka , the Egyptian word for soul-twin , and the Sanskrit Gau (pronounced ‘Gow’). 5 Both words link the cow symbol with the soul and the galaxy. Variations on gau include the Sanskrit Kaur (pronounced ‘cower’ or ‘core’), an"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 187 alternate name for the Cow Goddess Kali (or Ka -li), the name of the Hindu birth and death mother who was symbolized by the hungry mother Earth! 6 The Skilled Ones of the Healing Sun taught that every human being has a ‘lower self’ (the ka) and an immortal Higher Self. The lower self resides in the physical body. The Higher Self, the code teaches, resides at the Core. It is closest to God. Plato taught that this twin was our Guardian Spirit. 7 In the Acts of John , John tells how Jesus would converse with a Heavenly Twin who descended to join him: “When all of us, his disciples, were sleeping in one house at Genesaret, I alone, having wrapped myself up, watched from under my garment what he did; and first I heard him say, “John, go thou to sleep,” and thereupon I feigned to be asleep; and I saw another like unto him come down, whom I also heard saying to my Lord, “Jesus, do they whom has chosen still not believe in thee?” And my Lord said,” “Thou sayest well, for they are men.” 8 The Pistis Sophia pinpoints the moment in Jesus’ childhood when he first had awareness of this Higher Self. His mother Mary recalls: “When thou was a child, before the Spirit had descended upon thee, when thou was in the vineyard with Joseph, the Spirit came down from the height, and came unto me in the house, like unto thee, and I knew him not, but thought that he was thou. And he said unto me, “Where is Jesus, my brother, that I may go to meet him?” When the Twin finally found Jesus, “He embraced thee and kissed thee, and thee also did kiss him; ye became one and the same being.” 9 The goal of the Mystery Teachings of the Healing Sun was to join the lower self with the Higher Self.

The ‘milk’ that comes from the Core is light. This is the (nu-clear) substance Christians call Christ and Muslims call Allah. The milk/light/Christ/Allah connection is made in Hawaii where la is the root of light . Ala means “path” or “way.” 11 This definition brings new light to Pan , the‘God of All’ . It renders Pan as god of the Way. This bit of the code helps explain why Lat (an anagram for Tula or TLA) also means “mother’s milk,” why the Romans called the luminous celestial band the via lactea , or Milky Way, and why the word galaxy ( Ge - al - Ak -see) comes from the Greek ga-la , “mother’s milk.” 12 One Chinese-Japanese sutra tells how, in order to link with our Heavenly Twin, we must transcend out of the ideograph ga , which resembles the heron and fish hieroglyph.

In code terms the milk from the cow, the light of Tula, transformed into the Blood of Life, is the substance caught in the Grail Cup, the V , at the Crucifixion. The means to produce this substance of the Healing Son, I believe, was the primary knowledge possessed by the Family of Jesus and passed on to the Cathars. This is the principal subject of the Gospel of Love . This knowledge was obviously known to Mary Magdalene, who ‘knew the All’ or, as we can now appreciate, the Way. As noted, this Gospel was written in the Healing Sun code via the Language of the Birds. It is worth a momentary diversion to briefly outline the evidence that Jesus utilized the Bird Language to conceal his mystic secrets of the Way that I presented in my book The Language of the Birds . This evidence leads us to the inner meanings of the V symbol and clears the way toward a deeper understanding of his teachings. The Bird Language, it is said, was the original language spoken by Adam and Eve in the Garden. It gave them complete control over the elements. Did Jesus know this pre-Flood language? Judging by the stories of what happened when he returned to Jerusalem as a young man, one would certainly get the impression that he did. An example of this power is recounted in the Book of James . Because Jesus had the power over the elements, “all his words became facts.” When his schoolmates made fun of him, Jesus spoke their names with a curse, and they immediately died. The apocryphal Gospel of the Infancy tells us that as a boy Jesus carved twelve clay birds and turned them into live birds by rhythmically clapping his hands over them. 14 He was then sent to school to learn his letters from Zaccheus, a Hebrew priest. Zaccheus wrote out an alphabet"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 191 for Jesus. He asked him to say Aleph, and when he said aleph, Zaccheus made him say Beth. But Jesus refused. “Tell me first the meaning of Aleph, and then I will pronounce Beth,” said Jesus. “And when the master threatened to whip him, the Lord Jesus explained to him the meaning of the letters Aleph and Beth.” Then Jesus began to clearly and distinctively say Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, and so on to the end of the alphabet. At the end of this amazing discourse, Zaccheus was so surprised that he said, “ I believe this boy was born before Noah .” He turned to Jesus’ father, Joseph, and said, “thou has brought a boy to me to be taught, who is more learned than any master.” He then turned to Mary and said, “ your son has no need of any learning .” This exchange clearly shows that the Hebrew priest believed Jesus was demonstrating his proficiency in pre- Flood knowledge concerning the alphabet. 15 These episodes may not prove Jesus knew or utilized the Language of the Birds. However, it does point to this possibility. Another compelling piece of circumstantial evidence appears on the Shroud of Turin, the controversial cloth that is believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus. In The Language of the Birds I explored the strange way the letter V was used in early Christian depictions of Jesus. According to Shroud of Turin researcher Ian Wilson, the Byzantine portrayals of Jesus are believed to have been derived from the Shroud. 16 They show remarkable consistency in their markings. Included are distinguished nose and mouth patterns, marked cheek detail, hair, beard, nostrils, mustache, blood stains in the hair and on the face. All of them have a common nonsensical non-physiologic object: a V just above the nose between the eyebrows! This V is inside another V.

Why was so much care taken to insure that it appeared? The answer is obvious in the code. It was done to connect Jesus with the code of the Healing Sun, and the language of the secrets of creation. In the Healing Sun code the V represents the Grail, one of the primary artifacts of the Crucifixion. In addition to symbolizing the Grail Vessel or Ark, the V by itself has also long been used to represent the beak of the Bird Goddess (who laid the Cosmic Egg), and more. Byzantine portrayal of Jesus with the V on his forehead and the behind him."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 193 In Blue Apples , I interpreted the Crucifixion of Jesus as a stargate or wormhole event that produced a~tomic knowledge. The key code concealing this knowledge is provided in Matthew when Jesus uttered Eli, Eli, lama Saba Chtoni, (My Lord, my Lord why has thou foresaken me?), 17 just before giving up the spirit. The word Sa Ba caught my attention. This is not an original Hebrew word. When we drill into the meanings of this word we discover that in ancient Egyptian Sa is the word for the holy blood of Isis . Ba means soul and metallic substance . 18 Like its counterpart the Hindu soma it made pharaohs immortal. 19 This blood contained the Great Mother’s (the Core’s) spirit of all sacred wisdom or intelligence (which the Greeks called nous ). 20 During his sa -crifice Jesus ‘gave up the spirit’, one of the few Crucifixion events which all four Gospel writers agree happened. 21 His uttering of Psalm 22 indicates this may have been a reference to his relinquishing the Sa Ba, “the spirit or soul of all sacred wisdom.” Fascinatingly, the origin of the word sacrifice supports this supposition. Sacrifice comes from sacer , sacred, and facere , to make, and means “the offering of anything to a deity as homage.” 22 Facer means “one who is impudent or brazen.” 23 In the Bible “the one who is brazen” is the healing serpent hoisted upon a pillar by Moses. 24 This ‘worm of wisdom’, or serpent soul , I believe, is the subject Joseph of Arimathea’s request when he asked Pontious Pilate for the soma of Jesus. Crucifixion scholars argue whether soma refers to a dead or alive body. In the code soma also means holy blood of the goddess, and is called Saba in Egypt. This holy blood is the product of the blood’s interaction with the ~ of Tula.

The Eye of A-tum What actually happens, and is being referred to in the case of these observations, is that a projection from the ajna, ‘third eye’, chakra is formed by the yogi. This aperture of the filament or projection can be controlled by the yogi or pharaoh, according to the scale of the object under observation. Its placement between the human eyes emphasizes the spiritual skill, sight and wisdom of the wearer. It signified that the pharaoh was an Earthly representative of the Eye of A - tum .

Her cosmic resume states Gabri-El is one of four special angels called Seraphim (from ser , meaning ‘serpent’ or ‘higher being’, and rapha , or ‘healer’), popularly known as the ‘divine fiery serpents of lightning’. 38 This wise goddess was originally identified as the Serpent herself. The word ‘seraph’, says Barbara Walker, was believed to mean earth-fertilizing lightning-snake, and later was interpreted as angel . 39 The code symbol for the Seraphim is the serpent-entwined caduceus. This device is shown in the hand of Gabri-El in the depiction below. She is channeling the soul and the Life Force ~ into the body of the Virgin Mary, who is standing beside a lily ."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 206 Gabri-El wielding the caduceus and, in the Healing Sun code, demonstrating her knowledge of the secrets of genetic engineering?

The lily, therefore, compliments or rivals the serpent as a symbol for immortality. In Egypt, Gabri-el was venerated as Isis. Christ is equated with Horus, the son of Isis, the Core. In The Crystal Sun , Robert Temple describes how the birth of Horus was connected with a cosmic body landing on the Earth, possibly a meteorite. As Temple notes, the Egyptian texts say Horus came from a remote celestial realm that was even separate from the normal gods. 40 This notion is in line with the theory of panspermia, and leads to the speculation that, like Apollo, Horus was the Stone of Tula. The repeated biblical reference to Christ as a rock -- a (s)tone or key -- is made crystal clear by this symbology. Isis, sitting in front of a screen of reeds, is receiving the breath of life from Ra and transferring it to Horus via her breast."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 208 Gabri-el’s soul-transfer performance is dramatically matched by the Egyptian depiction seen here. Standing before Isis is Amon-Ra the Egyptian ‘Lord of Eternal Light’ (Michael in the Christian scheme of things). Standing behind her is Thoth. The goddesses on either side hold staffs of Asclepius and wear bird wings on their head. Ra holds the ankh or Key of Life to the mouth of Isis, bringing Horus to life. The second chapter of Genesis offers a similar description of the Key in use : “ And Yahweh, Elohim (Shining One) , fashioned the Adam of the clay of the soil; and He blew in his nostril the breath of life, and the Adam turned into a living Soul . ” 41 These remarkable depictions of the virgin mother with savior child make it clear that artists separated by centuries were inspired by the same muse to depict a profound soul- transfer technology. The son that arose from each of these examples was considered a ‘savior’ who delivered key knowledge. The other significant thing about these saviors is that they are not alone. In the next chapter, we will explore the story of several more virgin mothers and savior sons and their connection to the Core."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 209 11. THE SECRET OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER The code connections we have just made between the major religions and sciences prepare us to explore the story of Kore, the virgin daughter of Demeter, the Greek Mother Nature who was also known as the Corn Mother. The story of Demeter’s search for Kore after Hades carried off the latter formed the basis of the famed Eleusinian mysteries. It is loaded with stargate and wormhole imagery. To this day no one knows for certain the final secrets revealed at the culmination of the nine days of the Eleusinian Mysteries. We do know that for 2,000 years men, women and children candidates, called mystae , spent one year shutting their eyes to outer concerns (perhaps accessing the phosphenes) and then made a pilgrimage to Eleusis, near Athens. With a heart set on purity they underwent a terrifying subterranean initiation during which they entered a cave (or a •) and negotiated and overcame deadly pitfalls and challenges. When they emerged from the ground they were awakened. Proclus said that the initiates would look skyward and cry ‘rain’ and earthward and cry ‘conceive’! Initiates were forbidden to reveal the secrets of this initiation under penalty of death. However, their appellation, mystae , itself points to the nature of these mysteries. What is mystae but misty , and mst ? Remember, the Egyptian hieroglyph mst (mist) looks like a three-fold"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 210 fall of water . It means “dew,” and portrays drops of water falling from heaven. The same hieroglyphic also means “instruction,” or “teaching.” We can now appreciate that the code symbol for the baptismal mist is structurally the same as the Word . The Word is the . In its simplest form it is a . Together, these terms hint that the Eleusinian mysteries were some form of baptism in which the mystae returned from their experience in the • as if born again . Some ancient texts hint that the goddess Kore herself, or the light of the Healing Sun, appeared at the end of the initiation and gave her great myst -eries: the secrets of corn and grain, and the secret of the serpent wave , and the ME tablets that elevate humanity above the beasts. The Roman poet Cicero (106-43 C.E.) said that these Mysteries taught the initiate not only how to live but how to be free of the fear of death. In like manner, Pindar also declares he knows the origin of life. 1 This suggests the Eleusinian Mysteries revealed similar knowledge to the journey of Gilgamesh, who traveled through the underworld to the place of the origins of the waters of life. The first syllable of Demeter’s name, the Greek letter De or D (delta), is a triangle , the female genital sign, and the area around the nose . Corresponding letters -- the Sanskrit dwr , Celtic duir (phonetically ‘door’) and the Hebrew daleth -- all meant the Holy Door of birth and death. 2 In the code, the rest of her name, ME-ter , means “Love Mother.”"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 211 The place-name Eleusis was understood by the Greeks to mean “Advent,” pointing to the idea that this was the place, the doorway, through which the Holy Mother Demeter and her Divine Child arrived. Christianity adopted the term and applied it to the Advent or Second Coming of Christ, who called himself “the Door.” In John Jesus said: “ I am the door . If anyone enters through Me , he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.” 4 In this seal-impression Kore is enclosed in what may be a rainbow door. Notice the coiled object resembling the coiled form in the upper right hand corner. Like Jesus’ teaching, Kore’s mystery has two facets: the exoteric (outer) doctrine with a little mystery taught to the masses, and the esoteric (inner) knowledge of the G reat Myst-ery, which was reserved for the initiates. 4 Exoterically , the story of Kore illustrates the mystery of the door of life and death, symbolized by the cyclic re-"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 212 emergence of vegetation in spring and its death in autumn. Kore is the ‘Green Woman’ who spends six months of the year hidden from view, laying dormant underground, and six months in full view as leaf, flower and fruit. This is the mystery of the El-e-mental life force and the alternating cycles of death and rebirth. The esoteric mystery of Kore applies the same principles to the soul and its emergence from the Core and its earthly cycles of death and rebirth. This was the focal point of the mystery teachings of Eleusis. When the inititate recognized they are the captain of their ship, the ultimate Mystery was revealed in a mystical object -- “an ear of corn reaped in silence.” 5 The Hebrews called this object shibboleth , and supposed that it was the goddess’ dying-and-reborn god-son who entered Earth through a door, and showed the way to the Door. Interestingly, the word kern , as in kernel of corn , comes from carne , a hinge (a triangular door) or corner . In the New Testament, Jesus was seen as the healing Son of God who took his disciples into the corn fields and taught them the secrets of plucking corn and rubbing it in their hands. “And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands .” 6 An ear of corn is a flower cluster whose hundreds of seeds are tightly fitted-together along a rigid cob. What did Jesus hope would happen when he asked his disciples to rub this flower in their hands? When we put an ear of vibrating corn to our ear what do we hear? Does it get some neurons popping in our inner mantle like corn?

In Europe Jeshu (Jesus), the son of a virgin, was regarded as the Goldflower. 8 The ‘ or ’ of corn and Kore’s name means gold in French. Is it possible Jesus was teaching his disciples to become flow-ers of the gold (s)tone of the Core? Kr is the Sanskrit for creator . Did Massaw (the Hopi Messiah) also teach these same secrets when he taught the Hopi the secrets of creation or kore-a- tion (kore a tone) in an ear of corn? In India it is said that one of the Buddha’s most profound sermons had no words. 9 He merely held up a flower. This was his famed “Flower Sermon.” In addition to Jesus the Messiah and Massaw, did the Great Sun Buddha also know the secrets of corn? Though conventional wisdom says that Buddha’s golden flower was a lotus , no one knows for certain what kind of flower this was. A speculation comes from the definition of the word gau (pronounced ‘go’), the root of Gau tama the Buddha’s first name. As we have seen, gau is the same as cow . Gau appears also in Marguerite , the golden-eyed, white-spoked days eye . 10 This leads to the possibility of the daisy being flower that Buddha upheld. It is also of the essence to note that one of the classic Buddhist texts for clarifying the mind is The Secret of the Golden Flower . This book is a distillation of the inner psychoactive elements in ancient Chinese spiritual practices. 11 It was first brought to the west in 1929 by Richard Wilhelm, a German psychologist, with a commentary by Dr. Carl Gustav Jung, the great Swiss psychoanalyst and alchemist who credited this tiny but powerful book with having a profound clarifying effect on his own consciousness. 12"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 214 The Secret of the Golden Flower calls itself a “special transmission outside of doctrine.” 13 In other words, like the Egyptian description of the (s)tone Horus, it is from outside the of Earth. This means it works regardless of the faith or belief of the practitioner. Gold stands for light, especially the light of the mind. The flower represents blossoming, or opening up, the light of the mind. The Golden Flower is light. It is the one light within the core of each us. Its blossoms are the rays of the Healing Sun. In Buddhist belief, the awakened human being is one who has budded and opened the Golden Flower of the light in his mind to the celestial Christ mind , called Nous (Nu, Nut, Core) or Christ by the Christians. When we harvest all this information it seems possible that the Golden Flower Buddha held up was a golden corn flower. While it may sound corny or bird-brained to some, important code linking Buddha to corn is found in the Language of the Birds. The Bird Language is called the language of poets or bards . Another linguistic variation of ‘ bird ’ is ‘ bud ’ ( blas-tula in Greek), a verb meaning ‘to cause to bud, germinate, sprout’. Allowing for the substitution of bards , birds , and buds renders the Language of the Birds as the Language of the Buds or flowers. The Buds are also the Buddhas. ‘Buddha’ comes from the Sanskrit budh , meaning ‘ to awaken ’. 14 The Language of the Birds is likely the language the mockingbird taught the Hopi. As the Hopi story reveals, it is the language through which Massaw revealed the secrets of the elements; or of cor(n) . As we recall, the Maya called Tula ‘the place of herons’. Is there much doubt that in order to apprehend the secrets of the Core, we must"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 215 become as poets (bards), birds, or buds? Like Buddha? It seems quite undeniable that there is some connection between the Core, corn and the gods of the past. In addition to wearing our holy spectacles, must we also hold up the corn flower to flag down the awakened golden buds or Buddhas and to alert them to our readiness to proceed? If we held up the shibboleth another group who would most certainly recognize the code symbol of this gesture are the followers of Isis, the goddess of corn who was married to the Corn God Osiris, the son of Nut (the Core). We shall examine her story next. THE VEIL OF ISIS In the beginning, Egyptian scriptures said, “there was Isis, Oldest of the Old. She was the Goddess from whom all becoming arose.” The followers of Isis closely align her with the goddess Ananta, Athena and Neith (Net) or Wisdom , the goddess of weaving. 15 This goddess offered the thread of wisdom. Net’s symbol, the , meaning shuttle or weave, is often shown on her head. She is frequently depicted wearing wings, or with the horns of a cow. Both symbols are by now self-explanatory. The inscription above the entrance to her temple at Sais said: “ I, Isis, am all that has been, that is or shall be; No mortal shall draw aside my veil .” Interpretation of these few lines brings enormous wisdom. This divine woman is the Great Mother. Her sign, cow’s horns , is the word Oc. She is “all that has been, that is or shall be.” She is alpha (A, ) and omega (‘Great O’, the Cosmic Egg)."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 216 The ~ or Fire and Water (both symbols of gnosis , knowledge) of the Core, she makes perfectly clear, is not only hidden, it is “self-kindled and self-extinguished.” As the Createss, Isis gave birth to the Sun. Initiates of the Mysteries of Isis speak of a mystical experience, during which they see, coming from Isis, “a Light and other unutterable things conducing to salvation.” 16 This may be the origin of her name. Isis comes from Ashesh , meaning both “pouring out” and “supporting,” referring to her divine essence ~ that is poured out from the Core and supports all life. Ashesh is also the root for the Egyptian Aset , which means ‘throne’. 17 She is the Core, the throne of heaven, whose contents are thrown into the galaxy. The hieroglyph of Isis features her throne, the semi-circle symbol for dew, and an egg, affirming the Cosmic Egg and tone connection. The Gnostic tradition tells us that in its purest state this Wisdom or Fire (INRI) exists in the highest conceivable heaven. It is hidden from view. All the secrets of the Gnostic Mystery Schools, including likely the Eleusinian Mysteries, are hidden behind the veil (mantle) of Isis. Many have attempted to lift this veil and find her Is- land by diverse and ingenious means for various reasons for millennia."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 217 Perhaps in telling humanity that we can’t, the goddess is slyly challenging a curious humanity to discover her secrets. Her gate is narrow and those who succeed in crossing it are few. Descending stage by stage (ala the three-headed serpent channel on page 104), gradually losing the velocity of its spiral motion and vitality, the Fire from the Central Sun passes through the Cosmic Water and finally reaches Earth as fire or light . Only a small portion of the light ever gets to our planet and most is in the infrared region of the spectrum. (Some of these rays are actually quite harmful.) A few soapy bubbles from the fountain is better than none at all. It is just enough to have caught humanity’s attention. Tiet A symbol of the nature of the secrets that waits when the goddess’ cloak is pulled back is the sacred winged knot, seen on her chest. The sacred knot of Isis, called a tiet , is likely made of the same knotted rope as the of the heron and the of Jesus. It symbolizes the secret science, religion and sacred knowledge of the Core,"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 218 meaning this knot is probably not a knot at all. Rather, it is a (k)not or note . It is the G tone or Key of Life. With these key secrets her initiates performed the art of weaving knotting, i.e. the art of “binding” (fission) and “loosing” (fusion) the El-e-mental forces of creation, and tying the thread between Heaven and Earth. This imagery is found in the Pyramid Texts, which speaks of Isis as the personification of the ladder and of a ladder ‘knotted together by Re before Osiris’. Complimenting the knot, corn points to an interesting dynamic of the relationship between humanity and the goddess/Core. The fragile golden plant we call corn is physically incapable of regenerating itself without the active assistance of man. Corn’s greatest strength is its greatest weakness. Both are found in its grain bearing “ear,” which, as we have seen, is a flower cluster with hundreds of seeds. These seeds are tightly fitted-together along a rigid cob, all snugly enclosed in a spiraling, multi- layered husk. These husks protect the seeds, but also prevent them from releasing themselves either from the stalk or when the ear falls to the Earth and fanning out. Only when the ear is shucked (the veil pulled back), and the kernels are removed can the seeds reproduce themselves. Veiled like a cob of corn, the Core needs a Wayshower and a mechanism, humanity, to remove the limiting husks and release her seeds to go forth and start another cycle. It is interesting to note that exactly like the Hopi savior Massaw, Isis’ husband, Osiris, the Egyptian savior, was a gardener and a corn-god. He was also, we have noted, the son of Nut or the Core. His Djed Tree of Life may be equated with the corn stalk (the Gold Flower) and the corn"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 219 stalk with the stalk or stem (rod or ray) of Jesse (Jesus) and the ladder of Jacob ( I A Cob ) that reached into Heaven.

The ge rmination of the grain typified the ge rmination of the spirit-body of the deceased.” 18 In the illustration below the ankh cross or Key of Life (the knot or note ) denotes life (fusion), while the scepter or rod (the corn) denotes power (fission). Combined they have the meaning of life-power, which Osiris provided. The germinating spirit-body is equivalent to the kernels of corn on a cob. It projects beyond the body.

This seed contains the holographic pattern of the whole. This idea was adopted by the early Gnostic Christians, who believed that within our spiritual nature was contained an immortal spark • or Seed of Light . The Gnostic Revealer, the ~ rays of the Healing Sun descending from above , fans the dormant spark, causing it to re- member itself, and to remove its cloak, veil or mantle. This process of spiritual unveiling or dismantling is precisely what the Free-ma-sonic statement reveals: ‘from Point, to line, to surface to square or cube’. In fact the graduation of the Masonic initiate from First Degree to Second Degree was likened to a ripened Ear of Corn. 19 In the Third Degree, the Freemasonic Fellow perfects this process of psychological transformation. This reveals the splendor of his cube, and the hidden (s) tone within. As evidenced by the G above his head, George Washington was one such initiate who lifted the stone (hidden in the mantle) and who tied the knot between Earth and Heaven. The tracing of this Freemasonic ‘from • Point to cube ’ statement to Alexandria reveals an important piece of the code. This ancient university town was a hot bed of alchemists wielding amazing secrets. One example of the earliest surviving Alexandrian alchemical texts, “Isis the Prophetess to Her Son Horus,” emerged during the early Christian era. It is called the Codex Marcianus (‘Light of"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 222 Maria’), and will help us to tie the Gordian Knot between several traditions. In this codex from the 4 th century AD Isis gives Horus the secret of transforming herself into an angel (an L) by a higher being. 20 An elaborate philosophical and alchemical tract follows, most likely with the intent to produce the “Philosopher’s Egg or Stone,” the black or hidden (s)tone that will produce gold (corn/power) that became the symbol for the goddess Isis. Recognizing the necessity of intercession in the perpetuation of her mystery, Isis might well have said, “no mortal shall draw aside my veil. However , if you put on your magic glasses (wink, wink) you will have a better chance at success.” The goddess herself was even known to have supplied the magic glasses. Kore was the great power in the Coptic (Egyptian Christian) religion at Alexandria where the goddess Isis was depicted holding a female breast-shaped water jar or urn the Greeks called the ‘ si-tula ’. 21 Undoubtedly, the contents of the si-tula enabled seekers to ‘see Tula’, the Core. After Alexandria the thread of this teaching found itself atop Mount Moriah in Jerusalem where it was recovered by the prophet Mohammed (571-632 C.E.). The Koran , says Barbara Walker, was an enlarged, revised edition of the ancient Word of the Goddess Kore , revered by Mohammed’s tribe, the Koreshites (Children of Kore). 22 It was revealed to Mohammed by Gabri-El during meditations in a cave on Mt. Hira beginning in 610 C.E."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 223 The Muslim followers of Allah called Isis’ holy black stone the ‘ Kaaba ’ and bae-tulus . Muhammad allows four tribes to lift the black stone into position at the Kaaba. Mohammed founded Is-lam, the religion of All -ah (or -ah in code symbology). Allah stems from the name Al-Lat , the mirror image of Tala or Tula. It is obviously another Core based religion. In addition to the meaning Max Freedom Long already gave to a-la , “path,” he gives three other significant meanings: “ to rise up ,” symbolizing the rising of the Healing Sun along the connecting aka cord; “ to anoint ”; and “ to awaken , or “to enlighten ,” which in the code means to dispel darkness or ignorance, and therefore, sin. 23 Put together, the concepts of Kaaba and Allah form Kaballah , a system of mystical science, that according to Jewish legend, Abraham and his wife Sarah received. Also known as the Cabala , phonetically it is “cob ala” or cob of light. At the most esoteric level Cabala is Saballah (since the soft ‘c’ and the ‘s’, are interchangeable so too are the letters ‘s’ and ‘k’ are interchangeable).

Shibbolith (corn cob of light) is not that far from Saballah. In fact, the word Kaballah “comes from the Hebrew root QBL , meaning ‘to receive’, and refers to the passing down of secret knowledge through an oral (sonic) transmission.” 24 The Kaballah is said to have been taught by God (Massaw) to a chosen few of Angels (the Hopi) in Paradise (the Fourth World). In the Book of Genesis, 25 after God banished Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden He placed cherubim to guard the gate of re-entry to Paradise, and a revolving, flaming (s) word to guard the Tree of Life. In Hebrew legend it is said that God had a change of heart and decided to take compassion on Adam. He sent the archangel Raziel, whose name means “Secrets of God ” to give him a book -- The Book of the Angel Raziel or the Book of . With the wisdom of the souls might not only regain passage through the gate to the Garden of Paradise but also remember that, as the image of God, the soul is the looker into the mirror of existence wherein it perceives the Divine Face. This book “wherein all celestial and earthly knowledge is set down” has been handed down. An oral version still exists -- the Sabala or Kaballah . Sa Ba , we know, means ‘wise blood‘ in Egyptian. Many mystics link the Jewish Saballah with the Gnostic Emerald (S)tones, with the Holy Grail. From our investigation we can see why. Each, like the ME (or maize ) of E.A., allows users to open doorways to the Cosmic Ocean and to scale the ladder to Heaven that had once been sealed by God.

COSMOGENESIS As I have shown, the hidden Healing Sun of the Core is the basis for all the major religions. Its (s)tones and rays are acknowledged. Meditation, prayer, hallucinogens, the Bird Language, and in the case of the Mayans, remote- viewing, have all been employed to some degree of success as magic glasses or sacred spectacles in making the invisible Healing Sun of the Core visible. With the aid of our magic G lasses the veil of the goddess is arising. We are indeed going far into the universe. The sum of all these revelations give one reason to ask; has the Fifth World truly begun? Is it wrapped in lights like a Christmas tree all around us awaiting someone to plug in its power cord? If so, where is this power source? A major clue is contained in the meaning of the word Tula: balance. Each human soul, being a kernel off the old cob or an ash of the Fire in its pure state, temporarily residing here on Earth, can pick up the thread and then place itself in harmony with the Healing Sun by cultivating the highest balance, justice and judgment within. This will light up our world. When the human race mirrors these attributes of the Core collectively it prepares us for our own cosmogenesis -- the birth of a New (Fifth) World.

This is why the reunion with the One is the central conflict of mythology, which has encoded the Family Secrets in memes and stories.

I feel it is because they lead to the gateway to Heaven. Once apprehended the ~ leading to this gateway appears over and over again. For instance, in c. 330 B.C. Alexander sliced the Gordian Knot enroute to conquering Asia. No mere knot as Rachel Pollack observes, Alexander’s slicing of the knot represented cutting the umbilical cord to the Goddess. 1 And, in our view, to the Core.

As far as I can tell, since the beginning of time for every one who has sliced this cord there has been another master who has picked it up and attempted to re-tie it to Tula. Usually, this hero’s (or heroines) forging of the worlds is done against the will of the old gods and the established world order. Like Lucifer and Jesus, Prometheus disobeyed the father god or ruling order. He recovered and held the scepter (needle or rattle) in his right hand, lifted the cord to heaven, and brought fire, “light” or enlightenment to humanity. Prometheus stole the divine fire from Heaven in a hollow fennel stalk. Fennel is the symbol of spiritual rejuvenation or re- Generation . According to Pliny, it had the virtue of clearing the sight . 4 Provocatively, it was by eating fennel that serpents (souls) had acquired the miraculous power of rejuvenation. This may explain why a fennel stalk topped by a pine cone symbolizes the spinal column culminating in the pineal gland through which is reflected the light of the Healing Sun. This stalk is symbolically the same as Massaw’s planting stick and the staff of Asclepius. All three symbols represent fertility. In a myth which dates from c. 500 BC, Prometheus voluntarily chose to die for humanity’s sins. 3 He was crucified on a wooden upright, to which were added ‘arms’ of wood. Just like the Crucifixion of Jesus, after his death the Earth shook and shifted and darkness (the ~ of the Black Sun) covered the whole world. Enlightenment followed.

Like Lucifer, Jesus, and Prometheus, Pallas’ goal was to ‘lift the serpent’ with her rod and ‘tie the thread’ between Earth and Heaven. When she shook her spear the light of knowledge flashed forth, and all the darkness of ignorance fled away. By removing ignorance she removed sin. This ability is available to each of us. For example, when Jesus described Satan as ‘lightning fall from Heaven’ and promised his disciples the ability to ‘ tread on serpents’, 6 he may have been referring to walking on the mantle or “ threading ” the serpent thereby tying the knot ala Pallas. WAVES Perhaps the best analogy to explain the way the healing Staff of Asclepius works to ‘tie the thread’ (the connecting aka cord) between the two worlds is the way that waves transmits energy through a medium. The waves themselves do not cause forward motion. Instead, each individual particle maintains its stability about a point (•) by performing a circular or coiling motion. 7 Waves can be created in a rope held between two people. If one end of the rope is at the Galactic Core, for example, a wave travels in accordance with the amount of energy it is infused with.

The symbol of the priesthood of the Fish is the divine rising or standing serpent wave, sometimes shown as the caduceus, which is depicted as seven -fold in the woodcut of Hermes shown here.

(When $ is placed after the name of a variable in the programming language BASIC, it indicates it contains a text , a string of letters and not figures. 18 ) As noted, one of the results of the Crucifixion was the production of a special substance: a mixture of the Blood and Water of Christ. This substance was caught in the Holy Grail by Jesus’ uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, or Mary Magdalene. Interestingly, one etymology of the word Grail traces it to the French graol , meaning stone . This definition affirms our bird-brained (or egg-headed) speculation as to the nature of this substance. It is a (s)tone or Easter egg. As we have seen repeatedly, where there are eggs there are often serpents nearby. This is an important connection. Along with the $ Skill symbol it brings us to another breathtaking piece of Healing Sun code. According to Holy Grail historian Andrew Sinclair, a desendent of William St. Clair, in the French History of the Grail the Cup of Christ was originally called the escuele (pronounced ‘skool’, ‘skeel’ or ‘ skill ’). 19 In the code escuele draws a direct connection between Asclepius (A- Skilly -Pee-us), the Skilled One, and Jesus. In its Christian dimension the sacred Skill is the Holy Grail. It is the ability to bring the dead back to life. Mr. Sinclair claims the French History was the first description of the Grail as the literal Word or Name of God. 9 The History makes it clear that this healing Name or title was not Jesus Christ. It was Escuele or ‘Skill’. Hard shell Southern Baptists and Church of Christ Christians in my home of Nashville who live in the name of Jesus Christ will likely not be pleased with my research."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 236 However, in the heavy Southern accent spoken by some Tennesseeans (‘land of the rising sun’ in the code) skill is pronounced skeel or scale . Once apprehended, the Jesus as the Skill or Scale code is easily confirmed in Core religions. This is most noticeable in the Druid religion. Scholars have long debated the origin of the word ‘Druid’. In my opinion Larousse’s World Mythology may be the closest to the true definition. It says Druid came from daru-vid, meaning ’skilled’. 20 Others maintain the Druids are named after the Celtic word for “oak,” or duir , phoneticaly door . In Welsh, which is closely related to old Celtic, derw is “oak,” drws is “door“ and dwr is “water.” Either way, it brings new dimension to Jesus’ words, “I am the door.” It says he is the Druid or the Skilled One who can open the door. I have asserted that Jesus reconnected the thread of earlier Core traditions. Interestingly, modern physicists have resurrected the skl root for use in describing energy as Scalar energy, i.e. shaped like a spiral ladder. The Old Testament Joseph’s father Jacob laid his head on a stone and dreamt he saw a ladder reaching into Heaven. 9 Was this a scalar or spiral ladder of light? Did Jesus utilize this story as Source material? In Jacob’s story, which runs through six chapters of the book of Genesis, he sees a fiery image at the top of the ladder. On the right and left of each of the ladder’s twelve steps he sees a statue or bust of a man. Angels are ascending and descending this Ladder to God (in Latin the Scala Dei ). From atop this ladder G od calls to Jacob. He promises that the land on which he is sleeping will be his and that his descendents shall be blessed .

This is more than a piece of interesting"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 237 geographical trivia. In Godseed: The Journey of Christ , 21 Dr. Jean Houston presents what I consider a major revelation when she notes that Christos and Chrestos were interchangeable terms to the early Christians. Chrestos, she says, means simpleton, great silly or blessed one . She says that, in one of the apocryphal traditions, Pontius Pilate is supposed to have said to Jesus upon the Pillar, “Ain Chrestos!” or “You are the great silly.” 22 When the interchangeability between silly and skilly, both words mean “blessed,” is taken into account, might Pilate have meant to say, “You are the great Chrestos or Skilly?” Did this mean “You are the great Blessed One!? Or Skilled One?” In the view of Dead Sea Scroll scholar Dr. John Allegro, Chrestos refers to a hallucinogenic substance. 23 Our search has shown it was an essence that rises from within. Paul affirms this notion that Jesus is the incarnation of the divine skill or wisdom when he says, “he is the power and the wisdom (Skill) of God.” 24 The bottom line is the word Skill suggests God’s greatest secrets, the or ‘ dew ’ of Heaven, is not hidden in a particular human’s skull (even though the alleged decapitated head of Jesus has been traced for centuries). Rather, it suggests that a certain skill, wisdom, ecstasy, and mystery is available to all who lift the hidden within the mantle of their own cranium. It must be pointed out that the word cranium is related to the Greek word cranae, that is, “rock.” It also contains the word core . That’s right.

PTAH Asclepius and Jesus are not alone in the guild of Skilled Ones. Long before them, in Egypt, Ptah took up the thread of Skill and wielded the sacred therapeutic secrets derived therefrom. There is little to wonder why he was vested with the cord or knot as his symbol. Ptah’s temple hieroglyph features a knot or cord that resembles a DNA helix. The semi-circles mean ‘dew’. The symbol on the far left means ‘branch’. Ptah, the high god of Memphis and the master of destiny, was declared by the Egyptians c. 3000 BC to be the creator of the world. His followers took the Heliopolitan religion of the heron , the bird of akh , and re-tooled it for a new age. Ptah was declared to be Nun , i.e. the vibrational field, or the O, , and the . 1 He not only created the land he was the land.

Ptah, covered in bird feathers, holding the combined Uas, Djed and Ankh."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 241 For the above reasons Ptah was one of the key figures in Egyptian mythology. Equally importantly, he was associated with the All . He was most commonly depicted as a bearded man wearing a blue skullcap. His close-fitting garment is made of bird feathers. In his hands he holds the forked uas (“branch”), the ankh (“life”), and the djed (“stability”) that accompany the All. The great French Egyptologist, R.A. Schwaller De Lubicz, said that Ptah signifies ‘Fire fallen into Earth’. 4 Opinions vary among Egyptologists as to the meaning of the name Ptah. Intriguingly, Ptah is thought to mean “to open” by “sculpting or engraving.” In the code Ptah is an anagram for path , which is a-la or light (of the Healing Sun) in Hawaii. Islam’s God, Allah who, we know, was symbolized by a black stone at Mecca shares this title. Ptah was a master at working with metal and stone or (s)tones , i.e. fire , frequency ~, or vibration. In the famed Shabaka Text Ptah is featured as the divine smith who created created the ka or soul of each being. 5 Like E.A. Ptah was the god of craftsmen who taught humankind the arts of civilization. He possessed his own stone at Memphis in the same way that Apollo (or Ap- ala ) possesses his omphalos stone at Delphi. Ptah also shares a phonetic similarity with Peter , the Galilean fisherman who became Jesus’ chief disciple and the Head of the Catholic Church. In Matthew we learn that Jesus gave Peter the art of knotting, 6 or “binding” and “loosing.” (Nuclear fusion and fission for those who are counting.)

Thus, the pun of Jesus is illumined, “I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock (Latin petra ) I will build my Church.” 7 As Ptah laid the Foundation (S)tone for Egyptian religion, Peter did the same for Christianity.

Add a ‘t’ and we have choirast or Kore-ist ... Christ . No wonder I Corinthians 10:4 describes the spiritual Rock of Christ and why the egg symbolizes Easter. This and the Ptah connection may explain why the Church depicted Peter like Ptah holding the mystical hidden key (tone or tune) through the magic rabbit hole to Heaven, the Core. Doubtless this is the key referred to in Isaiah, 9 and in the Gospel of Luke. “Woe unto you!” said Jesus addressing the lawyers, “ For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter (the Promised Land,) yourselves and you hindered those who were entering.” 10 In Egypt, this key was the ankh , the Key of the Nile, which was also a key to the Nile in the Sky (the Milky Way ). As we can see, the Egyptians, and the authors of the Gospels, were fond of word and symbol play. They were masters of the Healing Sun code capable of putting the secrets in full view of those with eyes to see and ears to hear while concealing them from the uninitiated. There is several more Tula connections to be made here. The reversal of pth into htp , ‘peace’, ‘offerings’ is illuminating in the connection it draws with Tula, the home of the Peacemakers. The ‘Field of Offerings’ or the ‘Field of Peace’ was the land of the Immortals in the Sky. 11 Ptah’s center in Me-mphis was known as “The Divine Emerging Primeval Island,” established as the ‘Balance of the Two Lands’. Tula means balance and was the home of the Mayan Prince of Peace.

In the Egyptian book Am Duat “the king is full of magic from the Island of Fire... the possessor of offerings who knots the cord .” In code terms the king has the Sacred Skill of uniting or binding Heaven and Earth. Jesus, whom we have established was a Skilled One, repeated the “As Above. So Below” law and affirmed the Ptah connection in the Gospel of Matthew: “ I (Jesus) will give unto thee (Peter) the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .” 12 This statement makes it clear that whoever held the key possessed the key to the Door of Heaven (and the complete Code of the Healing Sun). They also possessed enormous powers of manifestation, including, I believe, the secrets of nuclear fission . What else do “binding” and “loosing” refer to, but the secrets of nuclear fusion (binding) and fission (loosing)? Perhaps more importantly, through their ability to tie the thread between the worlds (out here) and to connect the lower self with the Higher Self (in here), they also possessed the ability to lift the standing serpent wave ~ of Love energy emitted from the Core (and found in the mantle of the Earth). When this ‘rope is pulled’ it gives the keyholder the G Force energy to “water the garden,” and hence to re- Generate themselves and the entire Earth. Several key points can be made here. In 1307 the Knights Templar were persecuted for their acclaimed possession of exactly these secrets of re- Generation .

What, exactly, they discovered is unknown. Some claim it is the severed head of Jesus , who was called the Head in certain texts. 15 However, at the same time it was recognized that Jesus was perpetuating an older teaching, that of Ptah (which was later modified by Akhenaton). In Greek the words stone and head are etymologically related. “Kephas” (KEY-phas) is “stone” and “kephalos” is “head.” Kephas is the same as Cephas, the name given by Jesus to Peter... who is but Ptah in the code. Another vital clue to the identity of this Head is provided by the leader of the Templars, Hugues de Payens, who chose as his heraldic symbol three severed heads . 16 As in the Music of the Spheres diagram on page 104, the healing ~ energy of the Core follows a serpent channel that splits into three heads. As we have seen, this energy originated in the place the mystic Hebrews called the White Head, another name for Tula. Might this association be the reason for Hugues de Payens logo? The re- Generative secrets of this Love energy, the three-headed Word , which appear to have been present at the Crucifixion, have apparently been withheld from the mass of humanity for the past 2,000 years. The combination of de Payens symbol, and the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple at Rosslyn, or Rose Line , and its role as a repository of Templar secrets, makes me feel that the Templars discovered the secrets of the Healing Sun.

One clue to answering this important question comes from the story of Ptah. His followers said Ptah manifested in the form of nine gods called the Ennead (nine). Prior to this theory the Egyptians said that out of the bright light of Shu came the eight primordial gods of the Egyptians, the Ogdoad. 17 This eight-fold soul divided itself as in the famous mantra of Thoth, who was called the Lord of 8. “I am the one who becomes the two, who becomes the four, who becomes eight,” said Thoth. “And then I become One again.”"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 249 The ‘Apprentice Pillar’ which to some looks like a DNA molecule In this way, said the Egyptians, the primordial eight, plus one, formed one entity, Ptah.

The Old Testament gives us a clue when it mentions that there were eight persons saved in the Ark of Noah (Nuah) to repopulate the world. 18 The Ark is the ninth, represented by the pillar.

Throughout the ancient world we find mythological traces of this original group of nine beings who bring “fire” down from heaven. In the Hindu mythology, the seed of our present human race were the ‘sons of God’ (whom the Bible calls the “blessed ones, the Peacemakers”). These nine beings appear practically anywhere we look in mythology. In the Talmud, for example, we learn that upon his arrival the Messiah will form his Company of 8. Eight plus himself makes 9. There are 8 Immortal Sages of Chinese tradition, Nine Lords of Time in the Mayan tradition, Nine Cobras of Brahma in Hindu mythology, Nine Legions of Angels in the Kaballah, and the nine French knights who founded the Knights Templar (whose bones, incidentally, are buried at Rosslyn). Are they the same nine beings reincarnated throughout history? No one can prove they are or are not, but the correspondence is striking, as is the fact that they perform virtually the same function wherever and wherever they appear. That is, they discover the means to build an ark out of Earth, meaning they transcend the Garden of Earth.

Another instructive twin warrior story is the Greek tale told of two brothers who were famous architects. 3 While building a treasure vault they conspired to leave one (s)tone movable so that they might secretly enter and steal valuables stored there. The owner, who had discovered the plot, set a trap. To prevent discovery, one brother decapitated the other and fled, with the owner in hot pursuit.

In fact, in the story of this couple’s encounter with the Serpent -- or the standing serpent wave -- and of their warrior sons, Cain and Abel, we may gain a valuable kernel of wisdom to guide our ascent. In the Book of Genesis, 5 a conflict arises when we find the Serpent pointing out to Eve another viewpoint concerning the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge (which the Serpent ~ is no doubt threading). Jehova stated that if Adam and Eve ate the fruit, they would die. The Serpent told Eve that she would not die, but would become “as gods, knowing good and evil.” And when Eve and later Adam ate the fruit, this is exactly what happened. Jehova ‘lied’. The Serpent a rose as the teller of the truth. Still, Adam and Eve were evicted from the Garden. Jehova placed a flaming sword that turned every which way to keep the way of the Tree of Life at the gate to prevent them from re-entering the Garden. 6 In the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve, we are taught to fear not the Snake (who is E.A. in the Sumerian original version of this story), but the wisdom or Skill he can provide. Jehova feared Adam would ‘put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat and live forever.’ Clearly, E.A. began teaching humankind the secrets of everlasting life and of their true, unlimited potential just as Jesus did when he said, “Is it not written in your law, I said you are Gods?” 7 Later interpreters, misunderstanding the true meaning of this story, or again trying to conceal profound spiritual teachings for all but a persistent few, mislabeled this wise teacher with alarming epithets."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 257 From this point forward in the Old Testament, humanity was taught not to look within to our spiritual nature, for to do so is “bad.” Furthermore, E.A. and the Skilled teachers of other ancient traditions and teachings related to spiritual salvation, were so demonized that even today no average person would dare go near them for fear of being labeled a devil worshipper, a Satanist, or in the modern vernacular, a “New Ager.” These Family Secrets are missing because the Church viewed the serpent soul(s) who dwells in the Tree (Ark) and originally delivered them as a monster. We must remember that monsters symbolize the guardian of a treasure, immortality for example. I find it fascinating that the word monster is the same as minster or minister . As noted, Min is the root for min ister, a conduit between man and God and Minne the name given to Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love. Ministers guard the secret treasure within.

Apart from the obvious literary tampering is there another explanation? Yes. This is sheer poetry. Satan is simply a literary scarecrow devise. Originally the Hebrews understood “satan” not as the personification of evil, but as an adversary in the sense of a judge: an agent of God who asked trick questions or posed problems to be solved. One such satan appears in the Book of Job. It is not until the New Testament was compiled a thousand years later that the idea of Satan as an enemy of God"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 259 emerged. In time Satan was identified both with the serpent in the Garden of Eden and with the bestial dragon. The reality of the righteous standing serpent wave that was emitted from the Core was overwhelmed or concealed by the patriarchal tradition that seeks to keep this tone under control or covered-up completely (dis-mantled). The Church perverted this code symbol, promoting the idea of the Devil as half-man, half-goat or as a serpent monster in order to persuade its subjects into thinking the Christian Church was somehow superior to all previous human religious achievement. In reality, as Saint Augustine knew, there was an original religion from which Christianity was derived. The Church seems to be bent on keeping humanity from achieving much spiritually and using propaganda as a tool to keep folks from looking too hard for the secrets of creation. When propaganda failed to persuade, the Church reverted to mass murder as a weapon to keep humanity ignorant. Just ask Giodorno Bruno, the Cathars and the Templars. Gradually, the Church transformed the Serpent into the archenemy of humanity, coinciding with Paul’s misinterpreted concept of original sin. The Book of Revelation completes the transformation: ‘And the great dragon ( G ) was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the Earth (the mantle ) , and his angels (the Titans) were cast out with him’. 11,12 Meanwhile, throughout much of the unchristianized world the dragon retained its original meaning of Life Force energy ( G ), sent as Isaiah said, to bring salvation. The G may literally be in the mantle of Earth all around us, but Christians have been told not to look for it.

The old putrid dragon, the Prince of Darkness, would be waiting with a pitchfork ready to capture and torture their soul for eternity. If the plan was to keep humanity enslaved, enclosed within a spiritual prison, it appears to have worked. In case there are any Satan the serpent worshippers left in the world (or Satan as a serpent-fearers), we should be aware that coincidental with the dawning of the third millennium a Vatican guide on exorcism is altering the image of the Serpent. The new manual is the Vatican’s first update of the ancient exorcism ritual since 1614. The new slim, red leather bound volume eliminates the Church’s image of Satan as a serpent or a goat-like figure wielding a pitchfork and torturing the souls of humankind. The Church hopes this new manual will align it with modern scientific thinking. The new method takes into account the discoveries of modern mental health care. While the Church upholds its belief in Satan as a deceiver of humankind, these discoveries forced the abandonment of its earlier reliance on references to the ‘Prince of Darkness’ or ‘Accursed Dragon’. The new 90-page manual, written and printed entirely in Latin, cautions that even before attempting to exorcise an evil spirit, the priest must decide whether the victim is truly possessed or may, instead, benefit from psychiatric care. Of course, the Church still maintains that it has the final say on the matter of the Devil. It is not a matter of opinion to be decided by individuals. As we can see, the Serpent of Eden symbol is susceptible to many levels of interpretation. Even the Church is backing-off the traditional interpretation. If not a final figure of evil, what then was the original deep mystic Family Secret enfolded within the coils of this symbol that the Church wished to conceal? What does it mean when"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 261 the dragon drops out of the sky? The mythological and scientific data I have presented suggests that the Serpent of Eden, later seen threading the Cross in the Gnostic tradition, represents the standing serpent wave ~ that weaves a vine-like connection between Earth and Tula. By following this thread we find a vital piece of Healing Sun code and the answer to our question. Once pulled this thread leads us to the Crucifixion. An exposition of the ~’s role in Easter is found in the woodcut from Rennes, France shown on the next page. The serpent is found underneath the Cross of the Cosmic Egg -- Christ -- at the Crucifixion along with a skull. The skull is, by now, an El-e-mental piece of code. It represents the Skill employed by Jesus to raise himself above good and evil, freeing himself from the wheel of incarnation. The sun and the moon represent the life currents that, once united, open our spiritual vision and reveal the gate leading to salvation. This means the Skill also represents the scale of God . According to medieval Christian legend, Adam was buried on Golgotha (‘the Skull’). His son Seth returned to the Garden of Eden (Tula) to retrieve a branch (read Ptah’s uas ) from the Tree of Life (the Egyptian Djed ). He planted it on Golgotha where it grew into Christ’s Cross, the Tree of Crucifixion. This legend fuses the concepts of Genesis (creation) with Crucifixion (death). It also reminds us of the story of the ‘Egg of Creation’ in the Edfu Texts. Adam and Eve supposedly created original sin when they ate from the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden. Christ, who is called the ‘second Adam’, makes us of the Tree of Life in his Crucifixion, and redeems us of this sin (ignorance)."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 262 Woodcut from Rennes, France, 1860.

The existence of this knowledge and these rays has largely been withheld from humanity. This woodcut makes clear that the Crucifixion, and its mythology, can be interpreted as a moment of instruction concerning re- Generation . Interpreted in the Healing Sun code the Serpent beneath the mantle would have offered the standing serpent wave and an aka cord or wormhole connection (an Ark, arch or bow), to the Land of Love, which Jesus called AMOR, or Love, in the Gnostic tradition. The Serpent is even shaped like a in the woodcut and is wrapped around an . Jesus’ code connection with the goddess of the Book of Aker is easily revealed.

This ideogram conceals the concept, Easter. All these ideas, as we know, preceded Christianity by thousands of years. They originated with the Fish God E.A. The goddess of the Healing Sun was known as the Torch or Light of the Gods. She is the “woman clothed with the sun,” pregnant with the Christ child, who appeared as a “great wonder in Heaven” in the book of"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 265 Revelation . 14 The Buddhists called her Mari, the “Sun of Happiness .” 15 Mari is, of course, the same as the goddess with the Shugurra helmet, that enabled her to “go far into the universe,” perhaps even to Sgr A, the black hole located at the Core. I feel that his helmet may be compared to the crown of thorns placed on Jesus’ head at the Crucifixion. Happy comes from the Greek root apo , meaning ‘far away’. Symbolist Harold Bayley relates ap with OP , the foundation for optimism and optimum, high faith. 16 Op is also the root of hope and happy . Most importantly, op is also the foundation of optics , optical and other terms relating to the eye or eyeball. The word eye , phonetically ‘I’, says Bayley, may have arisen from the fact that the eye is a ball like the Sun which explains why this idea is found in the etymology of ‘eye’ in so many languages. 17 The letter I or i symbolically represents the pillar or pole. This pole opens the gate to the Healing Sun. One would not have simply up and walked through this wormhole. Instead, profound physical, mental, spiritual and emotional skills resulting in the enlightening of the initiate would have been mastered. The graduate would have become a Skilled One who could heal others and even raise the dead. The Nestorian Christians even believed that the Skilled Ones, including Jesus, were able to keep their body in perfect health and were capable of living hundreds, even thousands of years. My interpretation of the code suggests this ability was achieved by their knowledge of the Key of Life and the aka wormhole cord to Tula, as well as a key substance from the Galactic Core found in the ground, and present at the Crucifixion . In India Mercury was regarded as a concentration of solar energy underground."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 266 It is the food of the gods. In alchemy mercury is a symbol of soma , which Tantrism uses to govern secretion and circulation that strengthens the body. 18 This substance may be what Jesus described in this passage from John: “As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world. When he (Jesus) had thus spoken, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. He went his way, therefore, washed, and came seeing.” 19 The transference of healing energy by the receiving of the secret substance raised from within Jesus (his secretion) or in the ground is the object of all healing arts. As I discussed in Blue Apples , Jesus manufactured it at the Crucifixion. I find it fascinating that Jesus’ uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, was a prominent tin trader and a ‘minister of mines’. Druid legend maintains Jesus spent a portion of his ‘missing years’ learning the secrets of the soil in his uncle’s mines in England. If Jesus brought something out of the soil when performing his healings, as the highly instructive Gospel of John makes clear, this explains why the Gnostics depicted Jesus as the standing serpent wave. It also is the symbol for healing, as in the logo of the American and British medical associations. It is the standing serpent wave of Asclepius, and the rod that G od turned into a serpent in the story of Moses. This story is well worth perusal. Another excellent place for researching the secrets of the soil and the wormholes of the Bible, including their role in the Crucifixion, is in the book of Numbers. 20 We shall turn to this wonderful story next."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 267 15. LEVIATHON In the book of Numbers Moses and his brother Aaron were leading the Israelites to the Promised Land. 1 When they were on the verge of entering, Jehova ordered them to stop short and to send out some spies to search the land of Canaan. 2 One of Moses’ operatives was Joshua, an ancestor of Jesus, who was called the “Son of Nun .” 3 Along with a companion, Joshua was dispatched to the valley of Eschol (‘valley of the cluster’ as in grapes) where he stole a cluster of grapes from the sons of Anak who were living there. 4 He returned the grapes to Moses. Nun and the cluster of grapes (Blue Apples) later became cryptograms that were extremely important to the Essenes, the priesthood of which Jesus was a member, and the Gnostic Grail heretics that they held sacred and secret. The cluster of grapes symbolized the secrets of creation, the secrets of manipulating the mother substance and the symbol for the Grail. These are the secrets possessed by the Skilled Ones, making it thought- provoking that they were found at Eschol (E-School or E- Skill). From the description of their route given in Numbers and the length of their excursion (a ‘magical’ or initiatory forty days), it seems Joshua took a survey of a vast land, one larger than the Holy Land which can be surveyed in a lot less than forty days."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 268 Joshua and his companion took particular notice of Hebron, the burial ground of the patriarchs whose bones were thought to “mark” this territory as human for all time. Hebron (or is it Heron?), to their horror, was in possession of the sons of Anak -- who are described not as humans but as giants ! 5 The giants themselves lived at Eschol. In a story reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, we learn that when the spies arrived at the land of the giants they stole a branch heavy with grapes. These blue apples are so large it takes two men to carry them! 6 God had promised the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey. These grapes were certainly a healthy down payment! One would think the spies would have returned to Moses enthusiastic about their future prospects. Instead, Numbers tells us that upon their return the spies counsel Moses that attacking the vine yards would be a nightmare. Why? The cities are impregnable fortresses; they “are walled,” and “very great”. 7 But that’s not all. Even if they overcame the walls nothing could prepare them for the sight of the inhabitants of the vineyards. “We saw the children of An-ak there”, 8 the spies reported, “we saw the giants,” those men of a prodigious size, the “sons of An- ak,” which “come of the giants”. 9 The Sumerians called these Nephilim (giants) the A- nun-naki , which as we have seen, literally translates as ‘those from heaven to Earth came’. A-nun-naki is very close to the ‘sons of An-Ak’."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 269 Joshua and his companion appear as the two thieves at the Crucifixion.

The Hawaiian gods when needing extra supplies of the soma or mana (the food of the gods) were said to descend to Earth and take it from green things, as the grasshopper takes its magic fluid. 10 What kind of horror show could these spies possibly have seen? We know that, as the spies reported, the A-nun- naki were certainly militarily stronger than the Israelites. The Sumerian recollections attest they were big in stature and also well armed. This alone would be good reason to follow God’s advice and not to go trodding on their territory. But the Israelite spies reported another even more terrifying (and, therefore to us, a more interesting) reason for staying out of the vine yards. What makes this episode so startling to me is a mind- boggling bit of intelligence regarding the vineyards of the A-nun-naki discovered by Moses’ spies. That is this: “ the land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof ”. 11 What a strange and stimulating observation. “The land that eatheth up the inhabitants thereof.” What does this mean? Some think that there was a great plague in the country at the time that they surveyed it. If so, why shroud this simple fact in obscure language? People in ancient times certainly knew the meaning of the word plague. Another interpretation is that the land did not provide enough food for its people, an interpretation that contradicts the belief that this was the land of milk and honey. The phrase, “ the land eateth up the people thereof ” must have a more fantastic explanation. In fact, because of the imprecise language, it must refer to something the spies did not quite understand. What could it possibly be that eats people and makes them disappear from the face of the Earth?"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 271 It would be easy to say the spies saw either a space ship (which in this case they could not imagine, therefore they could not see). If so, they could have said they saw a “cloud,” a term used dozens of times in the Bible during episodes that are strikingly similar to modern day UFO sightings. If they saw an inner Earth opening that consumed people, they could easily have said they saw a cave. So, when they said “the land eateth the people up,” and they saw either individuals or a group of people disappearing into thin air leading them to believe the land consumed them, they must have seen something for which they did not have a word. We now have such a word: stargate or wormhole. In fact, once we have ‘eyes to see’, we can appreciate that the Bible is loaded with wormhole and stargate imagery. Now consider the story of Leviathon , the Hebrew title for the Great Serpent whose worship was established by Moses and dismantled by Hezekiah. 12 Variously called the cosmic serpent Tiamat or Yamm (I Am, Mari’s companion), in the code, Leviathon could easily be Lovey Aton ( Love Tone ), the Egyptian name for the Healing Sun whose vibrations bring La Vie , “Everlasting Life.” Leviathon is the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek Laton, La Tone . It is evident that Leviathon is one of the Old Testament names for the standing serpent wave, the tone of light ~ that fell from the Healing Sun and dropped out of the sky. According to the Babylonian creation epic, known by its opening words Enuma Elisha (“When on high...”), the universe was created after a fierce struggle between the creator god and ~ Leviathon (which appears as Lotan in the Ras Shamra texts). The body of this monster was split,"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 272 forming a barrier between the upper waters and the lower waters. Zecharia Sitchin makes the emphatic point in his interpretation of the ancient Sumerian texts that the tale of Leviathon is the tale of a terrible cataclysm between two planets: Tiamat, “the watery dragon of chaos” and Nibiru/An with E.A.’s son Marduk in control and playing the role of “dragon slayer” or “monster slayer.” 13 Marduk (renamed Michael) split her into two parts, her “skull,” or upper part and a lower or hinder part. The flaming fragments of Tiamat’s shattered lower half were “hammered” to become a “bracelet” tossed into the river of the Milky Way. Today, we call these fragments of Tiamat the asteroid belt. The upper part, says Sitchin, became Earth. Earth is the monster Leviathon reincarnated. “Like the prophet Jonah,” writes Caitlin Matthews in Sophia, Goddess of Wisdom, “or like the coiled infant awaiting birth, we are also in the belly of Tiamat...” 14 The ouroboros with a dove in the center.© Clive Hicks."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 273 The chain of fragments of Tiamat was condemned to eternally circling the orbital location of their former greatness. The alchemical symbol of the Ouroboros , the serpent with its tail in its mouth and, above all, a dove in the center, is an apropos symbolic representation of this event. At the annual Babylonian re-enactment of the splitting of Tiamat, a dove was split in half, in imitation of Marduk’s splitting of Tiamat. The fact that a dove represents the Holy Spirit that dove into the Earth and dwelt within Jesus in the Christian tradition brings up an astonishing connection between the two traditions. This symbol pre-dates Jesus by thousands of years. It affirms the statement made by Saint Augustine. This sea serpent is also known as Rahab. “Thou hast broken Rahab to pieces , as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. The Heavens are thine, the Earth also is thine...” “By his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces. By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.” 15 Rahab is said to have married Salmon, and so to have become an ancestress of David and Jesus. The second day of Creation of the Book of Genesis begins in the aftermath of the splitting of Tiamat and God’s enigmatic command, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters.” 16 What is the “firmament”? This archaic English word is a translation of the Hebrew word raqia , which is derived from the verb raqa , meaning beat out or hammer out. Remember Moses’ statement, “Of the Rock that begat thee thou are unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee?” 17 The implication of these statements is clear. We were made from the ruk (spirit) or raqa (waters, r- aqua , or raka) of the cosmic serpent wave."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 274 After Tiamat was split in two she was known as Diameter meaning “split mother” or “split matter,” which is the Greek version of her name. We still say diameter divides a whole circle. Tiamat was a crossed or split circle. Before going too much further, it is important to note that this splitting of Tiamat represented the beginning of our world. Secondly, when Marduk split Tiamat he was motivated by jealousy, similar to Cain’s murder of Abel. 18 Tiamat possessed the ME Tablets of Destiny. She had chosen her son Kingu to be the recipient of these Tablets. Jealous Marduk not only killed Tiamat, but he also killed Kingu. 19 When E.A. came along to clean up the mess his son Marduk had created, he made the first man on Earth out of Kingu’s blood. Kingu was identified with our Moon. 20 The Chaldeans called him Sin. 21 When the Christians came along many thousands of years later and said we were born in ‘sin’ they omitted the ancient fact that to the Sumerians this term referred to our genetic material that was imported from the moon. Since the moon was a common symbol for the Virgin Mother, including Mary, the moon is often interpreted as an emblem of Christ, who was called the “healing moon man”. 22 This explains why Jesus is depicted as the Good Shepherd carrying sheep (souls) on his shoulders. Christ is the genetic material, the carrier of souls that became enmeshed in the soil of Earth. Jesus said repeatedly that he was Ben Adamah (or in Aramaic Bar Enash ) -- commonly translated in the Bible as ‘son of Man’. According to some, this appellation was used to connect Jesus with the plight of the common man, emphasizing the idea that he had incarnated into human flesh and was mortal just like every one else. This is what his family maintained. In the code, however, the title Ben Adamah had a different meaning for those initiates who had the ‘ears to"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 275 hear’. The duality arose from the fact that the word Ben could mean both ‘son’ and ‘seed’. From this perspective, the title Ben Adamah could also be understood as ‘seed of Man’ or ‘seed of Humankind’. Both terms align him with the Cosmic Egg, the Healing Sun, which the ancients believed was the source of our souls. “I am the Good Shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep knows me.” Gospel of John 10:14 The Gnostic expression Seed of Humankind does not necessarily relate to the offspring of humankind, but rather relates to the original seed (the Cosmic Egg ) that"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 276 produced humanity. In this Gnostic light the corner stone of the ancient Christian mysteries is revealed. All things on Earth were created through the Seed (or Egg), that the Christians called Christ. He was the Seed of Mankind, i.e. the seed that flowered and became humankind. He is the corner (s)tone, cap (s)tone or tone that exploded upon the Earth into the radiant light of the previously darkened world. This bit of code brings clarity to the famous parable known as The Parable of the Sower. In the Gospel of Luke, 23 Jesus relates the parable as follows: “A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down... And some fell upon a rock, and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away... And some fell among thorns, and the thorns choked it. And other seed fell on good soil, and sprang up, and yielded fruit a hundred times more than was sown... He who has ears to hear, let him hear .” In case we do not have ‘ears to hear’ and to understand the code meaning of this parable, Jesus then gave the overt meaning as follows: “ This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the Word of God .” And, says Jesus, the word of God is hidden in the good (Sacred) soil . This Word brings immense abundance. Says Jesus, it yields fruit “a hundred times” more than was sown. The sower, Christ, is the Core. The good soil – the Rose Line -- is that which contains the energy of the Core."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 277 KILLING THE SHEEP Before we examine the story of Adam, Eve and Leviathon in light of the Healing Sun Code, let us first turn to additional important pieces of this Secret found coded in the story of their two sons Cain and Abel. After their expulsion from Eden Adam and Eve bore their first son Cain (kane), the first person to be born of a man and woman , 24 and then Abel. Cain was the first to till the land (making him a gardener). 25 Abel was a shepherd, the first keeper of sheep (the source of the Golden Fleece of wisdom). 26 After a time Cain brought Jehova an offering of the fruits and vegetables of the soil, a gift that did not please Jehova. 27 Abel offered him ‘the firstlings of his flock’ of lambs, a gift that pleased Jehova. 28 In jealousy of his brother’s killing the sheep, Cain murdered Abel, then in guilt denied the act. 29 From then on, on Cain’s forehead was given a mark of immunity so that all may know him and none would kill him. 30 Also from then on the Canaanites lived in agricultural communities. This protective mark of Cain is a mystery. The Bible does not say what it is. What symbol represents life and immortality? Turning to Egypt, there is one code symbol that represents immortality. That is the Egyptian ankh , the Key of Life. From our previous investigation, however, we may speculate that another candidate for the mark is the eye of the dragon . In Hawaii we have an excellent example of this part of the code at work. In one legend Kane is “ the god of Light ” who bathed in a pool of “living water.” 31 We have already seen this bath of living waters in the Egyptian baptism scene in which the Queen Hatshepsut is bathing in"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 278 a rainbow of ankhs. This ‘water’ was called mana by the Hawaiians. They called it “fine rain.” The Egyptians called it mist . In the Old Testament we have the exact same word mana, as manna, the food of the gods. The Hawaiian term for worship is hoo-mana (hu-man) and means “to make mana.” 32 As noted, in India Mercury was regarded as a concentration of solar energy underground, and the food of the gods. So, in the code Mercury is mana. By invoking the Mercury formula during the Crucifixion, Jesus seems to have been a Gold Flower demonstrating the secret of gold-making or God-Making. The interlocking nature of the Egyptian, Indian, kahuna and Hebrew traditions is plainly evident, and is explained by the kahuna belief that as the Keepers of the (Family) Secret they are the original Egyptians and Hebrews. These groups were not the only Skilled Ones to have access to the Secrets. Fifteen hundred years ago Shoshone shamen came to a canyon in the Mojave Desert in California on a vision quest. The bighorn sheep was his spirit guide. Until recently, it was an archaeological precept that the thousands upon thousands of Indian petroglyphs of sheep were all about hunting. The assumption was that Native Americans believed that making art of their prey would magically cause the creatures to materialize in abundance. The trouble is the Soshone ate wild rabbits en masse, not sheep. 33 “Killing the sheep” must therefore mean something else. According to archeologist Dave Whitley, “killing the sheep” is a metaphor for entering the supernatural through a trance. 34 From rock art, Whitley learned that the places shamans made rock art were held to be portals to the supernatural; cracks and caves in the rock were interpreted"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 279 literally as openings to the beyond. The art itself -- carved with chunks of quartz -- is said to depict visions that came to the shamans in their trances. The bighorn sheep is referred to as the spirit guide specific to rainmaking . 35 One ethnographic source cited shamans who traveled from as far away as Utah to these canyons in their quest for rain. In addition to sheep, abstract patterns are everywhere among the boulders -- grids, hatch marks, zigzags, curves, spirals. These marks are familiar to us as phosphenes.

This scene features ghaan’ask’ikii , Humpbacked God (opposite). This person is regarded as either a mountain sheep or a guardian of the sheep. He is a sheepherder. 36 Amazingly, he is defined as the “ god of the harvest, god of plenty, god of the mist ” 37 This mist radiates from the eagle (thunderbird) feathers radiating from his humpback. He holds a staff in his hand and stands before the tracks of Massaw. Like so many other biblical stories, including the Crucifixion of the lamb Jesus, Abel’s ‘killing of the sheep’ may be interpreted exoterically or esoterically. As is common, the esoteric interpretation is far more interesting and educational. It leads us out of the shallow waters into the deep pulsating waters of the Cosmic Ocean. Another biblical mystery concerns the identity of the people who Jehova thought might harm Cain. The Bible says Adam, Eve and Cain were the only people on Earth. Who, then, did Jehova fear would harm Cain? This inconsistency suggests that concealed within the story of Cain’s murder of his brother Abel is a vital truth: there were other beings on Earth. Who were they? In addition to the An-un-naki, the ‘lost books of the Bible’ tell us that among the other inhabitants was Lilith, Adam’s first wife who is also known as Astarte . The Canaanites worshipped her as the Mother Goddess Kore . She was the mother of all souls in heaven to who she gave their “astral” (light) bodies. 38 This light body is the Heavenly"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 281 Twin. As the prototye of the virgin Mary, she was the mother of all baal (gods), and was symbolized by an ear of corn. 39 Personifying every aspect of nature, to the followers of this Goddess corn was more than just a symbol. Corn itself was a way to experience the love ( G ) of the Core. In the spring, when the goddess’ womb opened, they sowed. In the summer they reaped, and the corn-god appeared. One part heavenly, one part earthly corn was literally the “son or Sun in the Earth,” yearly reborn or resurrected. Tillers of the Earth, such as the biblical Cain, nurtured this ‘son of the Core” then decapitated him and ate him. 40 Here is another great Family Secret. Abel is not a person. In the inner teaching Abel is a Baal or a bell . Like a bell he is a ringing, singing, (wailing) or tune; the Healing Sun-Song of the Core. This is inferred in the code symbol of Abel as a shepherd, the first keeper and killer of sheep (again the source of the Golden Fleece or phosphenes of wisdom). That which produces the Golden Fleece (and the Golden Flower) is a tone. This fact is concealed in the code term sheepherder, or rather, (s) heep herder. A heap is a pile, particularly of stones. In Scottish a heap of stones is a cairn . Phonetically cairn is karn or korn , rendering Abel as a herder of corn. In case it might be thought that this interpretation of the word sheep herder may be stretched to far, it may be instructive to consider that this is what corn does, it shep herds the energy of the Core in its ears. As we have noted, the Mayans claimed humanity was made from maize. The name Abel also resolves into ab heart and el Shining One. In accordance with the Language of the Birds, Ab or ob turns into ap , the root of the Greek apo , meaning “far away O.” Ab el becomes ap el or apple . The interchangeability of ab and ob or orb enables us to"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 282 resolve the name Abello or Apollo into the Or (Corn) of the Shining One. On one level this son or Sun of the Core is Asclepius, the son of Apollo and Core. On another, perhaps more accurate level, the son of the Core is literally corn. When Cain murdered Abel, he may have decapitated him like an ear of corn from the stalk. The corn’s cob, like the Corn God’s head, is removed because its ears herd the energy of the Core. As if to confirm this, in Peru Capac meant not only the name of their great and powerful ruler, but was also a name for the Sun . The first Inca monarch was named Manco Capac. He was the son of the Sun, and was called “king” and “lord.” He ruled with a golden wand. 41 Capac also means ‘to hold, contain’. 42 In electricity, a capac- itor is a condenser, a storage apparatus for an electric charge. Capac- itance refers to the property of a condenser that determines how much charge can be stored within it. A condenser is also a lens for concentrating light rays on an object or area. Amagalamating these terms, it appears corn is a golden wand that acts as a capacitor, a condenser (or herder) of electrical energy, or the healing light rays of the Core. In view of the way such meaningful code terms collide, this may explain why Jesus had his disciples rub corn in their hands. It brought the singing Abel (bell), the tones of the hidden Healing Sun, out of its hiding place in the Earth. The bottom line here is that Cain and Abel appear to have tricked Jehova. They are enacting the archetypal story of the two builder brothers who built a heep of stones. Did Abel the heep herder leave one stone movable so that they might secretly enter and steal valuables stored there? Did Jehova set a trap? As in the aforementioned story, to prevent discovery, did Cain decapitate Abel and flee, with the owner in hot"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 283 pursuit? Did he hide in a grove (or groove/tunnel) where the Earth suddenly opened and swallowed him up? Adding to this line of speculation is the fact that Abel is evidently the same as the “Good Shepherd” Osiris, the Corn God and Green Man who was decapitated by his brother Set , who reappears in the Bible as Seth, Adam and Eve’s third son and the “supplanter” of Abel. Set’s Greek name was Typhon , the serpent who battled with Zeus. 43 Set’s name obviously rings of Satan . The two combatants battled all over the Earth and in the skies until a final battle took place at Mount Casius, near the boundary between Egypt and Arabia – which Zecharia Sitchin locates somewhere in the Sinai Peninsula, where Moses later met Jehova. Zeus ‘battles’ Typhon the standing serpent wave."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 284 As seen a moment ago, Jesus (or Ge -Zeus) later had a similar ‘battle’ with the serpent Satan, and he taught the secrets of corn. As is made clear in the depiction shown here, the serpent in question is clearly the standing serpent wave. Surprisingly, though he won the ‘battle’ with the standing serpent wave Zeus had to share his new found power with his brother Hades, the abductor of Kore. Hades became a Hidden God (Black Prince) who resided in the womb of the Earth. His Greek name Aidon-eus , 44 a title of the phallic Hidden God in the womb of the Earth, rings of Adon and Aton , was well as adder or snake. The suffix neus is nous or widsom. In other words, like a bell and a tone, Hades is the standing serpent wave of wisdom. One can only wonder if Hades and Typhon share the same relationship as Abel and Seth, with one supplanting the other to fool the gods. Or, if instead of being an abductor of Kore he was, instead, a conductor of the symphony of energies of the Core. In this case the conflict -- the global battle -- between the two complimentary gods might have been added to enhance the drama, and hence the memorability, of the story. Hades was known as the Lord of Riches. Of the underworld mysteries of Eleusis, Greek playwright Sophocles wrote ‘thrice blessed are those among men, who, after beholding these rites, go down to Hades. Only for them is there life, all the rest will suffer an evil lot.’ 45 In this case the term Hades is clearly a reference to the underground worm hole to salvation. In this context it is fascinating to review what Jesus said about riches and treasure. “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through nor steal : For where your treasure is, there will be your heart be also."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 285 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light .” 46 In Luke Jesus makes crystal clear that the best hiding place for treasure “where no thief approacheth” 47 is in the heavens, where we will also find the Kingdom of God. There we will also find our heart. Our thesis is that this ‘heart’ is code for the Galactic Core. The ‘treasure’ is the rays of the Healing Sun that manifest on Earth as standing serpent waves. These riches are found in the heavens, but are also (secretly) within the Earth. Corn acts as a condenser of these energies. In Matthew 13 Jesus delivers seven parables called the “mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.” Jesus said, “the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field.” 48 “It is like unto a drag-net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind.” 49 This Greek term “ drag -net” conjures pictures of a net or knots of dragon energies dispersing in net-like fashion over the magnetic field of the Earth. In light of this code, the movie Field of Dreams , in which an Iowa corn farmer plows under his corn and builds a baseball diamond for a team of deceased spirits of early 1900’s baseball players, is highly erudite. The players cross-over dimensions through the corn field. In Hopi terms it is their place of ‘emergence’. We will have much of import to say about this drag-net momentarily. First, let us continue with the story of Cain. THE NUCLEAR SMITHS Cain’s name means ‘smith’, hinting that tilling the ground for hidden treasure ~ and smith craft (or alchemy ) may be interwoven disciplines. Apollo was called ‘smithy’. Ptah was considered the master smith. In"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 286 Germany, the Schmidt’s were a class of metalworking and gold smithing shamans who were also bards . 50 Many (s)myths emphasize the connection between smithcraft and the worship of the goddess, and hence, her understanding of corn (which is French slang for ‘gold’). For example, Egyptian priests of Isis were called mesniu ( maize -nu), 51 ‘smiths of nous or nu ’, the nut, kernel or core. These priests claimed the special powers of binding ( nu -clear fusion) and loosing (nu-clear fission) stemming from their secret connection to the feminine forces of nature (by our interpretation the energies of the Core), and their secret knowledge of corn or maize as capacitors or holders of secret energy. This energy is the standing serpent wave. This returns us to the Mayan idea of the ‘serpent rope’ powered by the black hole at the Core. Cain or can means ‘serpent’ in Mayan. Rabbinical tradition maintains that Cain was begotten by the Serpent and not by Adam. This makes perfect sense in light of our earlier comparison of the serpentine energies of the Core and the DNA molecule, and the Sumerian stories of the serpent E.A., whom Zecharia Sitchin upholds as a genetic engineer. In the Healing Sun code this serpent or snake is actually a sun ake , or sun ak , which means ‘light’ in Egyptian. It is the aka cord or “power line” of the kahunas. In other words, when the Serpent of the Garden of Eden tempted Adam and Eve, we may, once again, conclude he did so with the light of the Healing Sun and its •. The tones emitted from this Sun, called Abel or a bell, as we noted, are not dead. They are merely hidden. As in the story of the two brothers who faked the death of one to evade the gods Abel is hidden in the ground. This mischevious plot, and additional pieces of the code, appears in the Mayan story of the Hero Twins whose"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 287 father was the Corn God. In the Popul Vuh his severed head symbolized the harvested ear of corn. The Mayans viewed corn much the same way as our search of the code has revealed, as a mythological substance as well as an actual flower or flow-er of energy -- a standing serpent wave of energy. The Corn God is known as Ah Uaxac Yol Kauil , and is at the core of Mayan religious thought. In The Hidden Maya , Martin Brennan tells us Ah means “he,” Uaxac is “eight” or “8,” the number of the Corn God, the shape of the double helix of our DNA, and double of the number four which is the Sun God. Yol means “heart of,” Kaa means “abundance” and uil “sustenance.” 52 The Resurrection of the Corn God. The Mayan Corn God blossoms atop what appears to be serpentine energies underneath the Earth. His long wavy hair represents cornsilk. Laid out from end to end, this piece of the code says that corn herds sustenance for our DNA. Mankind, says the Popul Vuh , was made of maize. This makes perfect sense in light of our association of maize with the ME tablets of E.A. The Mayan artwork raises a question. Was E.A., the ‘Serpent/Gardener’ who created Cain, or one of the other Skilled Ones, present at the Resurrection of the Mayan"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 288 Corn God (and of Jesus)? For an answer we turn to the ancient Egyptian priests who used a right angle or L symbol (below) called the kan (cain). This hieroglyphic represents the corner stone (corn tone). This form appears in Mayan art. The L symbol of kan is virtually identical to the Greek gamma (below), which is also a symbol for Gaea the Earth goddess. 53 Gaea is Ge or G , the re- Generative force of the Galactic Core. The serpent is G. (KHAN is the Mongolian title for King or Ruler, and as late as the 13 th century the Khans claimed to be of serpent race . 54 ) This symbol is the mirror-image of Daleth, the fourth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In Hebrew Daleth means Door. Cosmically, Daleth is the point of transition from one world to another. The key to the door is the accumulated essence ~. This may explain why Daleth is sometimes called the Cosmic Womb. In The Zelator , Mark Hedsel notes that this form is comparable to the Pat-aik symbol, the ‘Golden Angle’ found in the hands of Egyptian gods including Ptah (which is phonetically Pata) and Osiris . 55 Pata-ik means ‘dedication of the angle’. The code name ‘ Sicily ’ (Scilly or Skilly) has been traced to this angle, for the tribe of the Sikeli took their name from the Egyptian meaning ‘Sons of the Angle’. 56 These ‘sons’ include all the Skilled Ones mentioned here including Asclepius, Jesus, and yes, E.A.,"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 289 who came to Earth in search of the blue stones that turned one into an El or an L. The symbol is also the place sign for the Mayan town of Chiyo Canu . Chiyo (‘Chi’ or ‘Key’) means “altar . ” Canu means “large” or “break.” But kan means ‘serpent’. Kane is “ the god of Light .” Martin Brennan amalgamates these terms into “day break,” which is dawn; the time of the rising sun . The Greek followers of Pythagoras maintained that there was a central fire in the middle of the universe. They called this Mother of the gods or Meeting Place. Another of its names was Altar. 57 In the code Chiyo Canu can be interpreted as Altar or Meeting Place of the God of Light. This place is the Core. In summary, the Skilled Ones or Skilly possessed the science ( revelation) of the snake or Sun Ak , the cord (wormhole) connecting us with light of the central Healing Sun. This light is the standing serpent wave weaving itself along the Staff of Skill(y). The Egyptian depiction (opposite) of the two ‘Aker’ lions supporting the Key of Life, symbolic of the Way to Tula, makes clear that this kingdom is Tula. The Egyptians of the later dynasties believed that during the night the sun passed through a kind of tunnel (wormhole?) which existed in some nether region, each end of which was guarded by a lion-god, the two deities being called Ak-e- ru . These were the Light Horizon and the Life Horizon, representing the material and the spiritual worlds respectively.

It is most unfortunate that most people who today are members of the major religions have no in-depth knowledge of the code contained in the story of Tiamat and the role it played in the early development of these religions. If there be one thing considered out of this book it is the meaning of the Key of Life carried by the half- man, half-fish Sumerian savior god. It is a planting stick designed for ‘working’ the good soil. To hold the ankh symbolized the soul’s readiness to board the arc or boat of the Sun God, and as a sign that they seek rescue and immortality. 58 The ankh or Key of Life therefore symbolized a door, bridge or interface out of the cataclysmic destruction of Tiamat. The top of this sign is the hieroglyphic Ru , , set upright on the Tau cross. This is the symbol for the vessel of the Fish. The Ru is the door, gate, mouth, or the place of escape. As the symbol for the vulva, it is the womb of Earth."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 292 Incredibly, the Dogon tribe of Africa, who worshipped E.A. as the half-man, half-fish god Oannes, regarded the ANT HILL as the world’s vulva. 59 The ant hill is also the Hopi place of emergence. This means the vessel of the Fish is Earth, and returns us to the idea that our DNA is the planting stick of Massaw. Hermetic Cross, the crescent and the tau cross The cross upon which this gate rests is the human body. Hermes’ sacred cross elegantly combines the crescent symbol of the Moon (Kingu/Sin), from whence our genetic material derived, and the tau cross T symbolizing the human body. When Jesus was crucified it is said that in the Temple of Solomon the “shadow of the Cross” (code for the ) was visible to those who had eyes to see. It was in the forecourt of the Temple that the Brazen Altar was set up, on which were sacrificed many thousands of animals each year. From the Brazen Altar the upright of the cross ran straight to the Ark of Covenant in the Holy of Holies. In the early Christian era the inititates knew the relationship of the human body to biblical events.

In a sense, the human body may be viewed as a soul resurrection machine, a flower, flow-er, or a conductor of souls. “Jesus was a flower,” says Higgins, “whence came the adoration, by the Rosicrucians, of the Rose and the Cross.” 60 Whether written Rose , Ras or Rus or symbolized as the the word means knowledge or wisdom. This wisdom was stolen from the center of the garden , Tula. This would further explain why the emblem of the Rosicrucians, the Rose on a Cross, is a Cross inside a circle, the symbol for Tula. Early Christian symbol from the catacombs in Rome. The early Christian symbol of the anchor (ankh kor) with fish grasping a line of hope was adapted from the Cross of Hermes and the ankh. It clearly shows the split circle of Tiamat. Two fish grab a life~line. The anchor’s link to the salvation of the souls of Tiamat is found in the Egyptian hieroglyph for the heron and the Christian symbol for Jesus: the fish , a loop which contains a ru circle and the Cross in one image.

This is the escape path of Isis. When the soul retied the thread with the Core it was considered a heron and given wings. In Egypt certain angels carried “cords of law”that meant “cords of Maat (law)” or Tiamat. These were rescue lines. In Christian art (as on the next page) we frequently see Jesus at his ascension inside a Cosmic Egg shown rising into a heavenly vesica, as if returning to the Core through the Ant Hill. Do these depictions secretly conceal a recollection that Jesus traveled the wormhole to Tula, ala the rabbit in Alice In Wonderland , and returned with vital instructions? When Jesus says he is the Way, the Truth and the Life” and that the only way to Jehova, the Cosmic Egg, is through him does he mean he is “the Way” through the womhole?

IN THE BELLY OF THE WHALE Despite the fact that the majority of Jesus’ disciples were followers of John the Baptist and were prepared to receive the thread of his teachings, many parables and signs of Jesus made no sense to them. This is because they are code. One key example is when he spoke of the ‘sign of Jonah’. Not one disciple seems to know he was talking about his crucifixion and resurrection. “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale (the Fish ); so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth .” 1 Jesus receives his ‘cloak’ or ‘mantle’ after this baptism by John the Baptist. Notice the and spirals at his feet."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 298 In the myth of Jonah and the whale, Leviathon is the whale that swallows Jonah. He enters into a time of darkness, an intermediate realm often compared to a womb. Jonah is in the belly of the ‘whale’. On the surface Jesus’ reference to swallowing and being expunged by a whale may be a simple reference to an early initiation rite. In Aboriginal Australia when a boy was initiated into manhood at puberty his circumcision is incorporated into a ceremony in which the boy is said to be devoured by, and then regurgitated from, the Great Mother in the form of a Rainbow Serpent. Although she swallowed them as boys, they emerged from her coils as men. 2 Jonah’s whale is described in the Bible as a “fish.” This is attributed to the fact that the early Hebrews did not know that the whale is a mammal. 3 When Jonah went into the belly of the fish for three days, 4 he prefigured the three days between Jesus’ death and resurrection. From our search, it makes perfect sense that when they said fish they were speaking of the fish . In the code, he is meandering through or crossing the arche waters of life ~ or Nun (O), the fish mouth. He is in the wormhole. In fact, nun the twenty-ninth letter of the Arabic alphabet also means ‘fish’ and especially ‘whale’. The shape of the Arabic letter -- the lower half of a circle with a dot • above a crescent indicating its center -- symbolizes Noah’s Ark or Arc floating on the waters. In esoteric symbology the fish always refers to something that is secret or hidden. Fish are the symbol of the Central American maize god. 5 The meal of fishes Jesus participated in with his disciples undoubtedly referred to the revelation of secret kowledge. 6 It was his understanding of this knowledge that gave him great spiritual power."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 299 It is my contention that his meal was made of spiritual essence grown in soil laced with the ~ of Leviathon. By this same serpent raised up on a staff within himself Moses performed his miracles, provided mana and holy water, and led the Israelites to the border of the Promised Land. By the same power within himself Jesus multiplied the loaves and fishes, cured the sick, raised Lazarus from the tomb, and peformed the miracle of Resurrection, Ascension and Transfiguration. When raised within the body the Leviathon or “Love Tone” created a ‘song’ in the blood that ‘tuned’ or balanced the initiate with the vibrations of the Healing Sun . This created the , an arc, arch or ark, a hole in space, through which one heard the song of the Healing Sun or traveled to Tula. (The word ark is a rk or a rock . The mirror image of rk is kr or kore , which became chr which answers to core and choir , a song.) When Jesus went into the belly of the Fish where did he go? The Gospel of John tells that after the Crucifixion Jesus had been ‘missing’ for three days, his whereabouts unknown. When he reappeared, or was resurrected, a previously unidentified person Mary Magdalene called “the Gardener” accompanied him. 7 Who was this unidentified person? The Sufis say it was El Khidr , “the Green One,” whom they said was Elijah. 8 John the Baptist, said Jesus, was Elijah returned. 9 He is Hermes, the Guradian of the Green Ray and the Waters of Immortality. 10 The ‘gardener’ reference offers additional thought-provoking code.

The appearance of the Gardener suggests an answer to the question of just exactly where Jesus spent his three days in between Crucifixion, Resurrection and Transfiguration. The location is Tula, the Healing Sun. There is more to connect this figure with Tula. Actually, Jonah’s whale is a re-tooled form of E.A., the Sumerian teacher of gardening, who was called Oannes , meaning ‘dove’, the root of Jonah. He is also the serpent of Eden E.A.

In the Book of Numbers, I Am said to Moses, “ Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looks upon it shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.” 17 Another key figure who was bitten and vomited up by a serpent was Jason, whose Ark was called the Argo (or Arko ). It is significant that there were 50 Argonauts. Nun means fish, but it signifies 50. The name Jason is the Greek form of the Old Testament name Joshua , who was the “son of Nun,” and the New Testament name Jesus . This is another reason why the Nun (fish) was the code letter-number for the Messiah. The whale also resurfaces in the Koran (Sura 18) in the parable of Moses’ journey to the gate of immortality, carrying with him a fish (nun). Moses reached the gate at the meeting place of two seas.

It is a golden needle or antenna that ties the ‘thread’ or ‘rope’ (the cord, chord, or standing serpent waves) between the upper world and the lower world. In this bas-relief from Abydos, Isis sets up the Pillar of Meroe, a “Casket” containing the ‘head’ of Osiris. Osiris’ Tree of Life is featured in one of Isis’ most famous life episodes. In a story that rings of the other brother stories we have looked at, his half-brother Set decapitated Osiris. His body was cut into fourteen pieces."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 316 His head was kept in a casket or pillar and was later resurrected or re-membered by Isis, who reconstructed the Pillar at her island at Meroe . The Pillar of Osiris, also known as the Pillar of Meroe , was a phallic-shaped device that stood approximately 40 feet tall. Meroe is the same as Mariah , where Jesus was crucified. It was made of evergreen wood and lined with gold. Also called the “Ladder to Heaven” and the “Backbone of Osiris,” it linked Heaven and Earth. 20 The Pillar of Mero housed what appears to be the ‘serpent rope’ described by the Mayans. It is also, I believe, the same as Leviathon. Interestingly, another name for the Pillar is the Shu . The two ‘tablets’ atop the Pillar are called Shuti , meaning ‘awareness, enlightenment’. 21 Theosophical texts state that Shu is pronounced ‘s huck ’. This calls to my mind the husk of corn which is ‘shucked’. The corn connections are amazing. I have also placed this device at the Crucifixion. Matthew notes that as a result of the Crucifixion the sun was darkened (a Black Sun appeared), the veil of the temple was ‘split in two’ and the Earth shook . This Pillar has a fundamental code connection to the Key of Life. In Greek the words stone and head are etymologically related. “Kephas” (KEY-phas) is “stone” and “kephalos” is “head.” Kephas is the same as Cephas, the name given by Jesus to Peter."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 317 ! Moses with rays of light emerging from his head holds the tablets containing the Ten Commandments. Right, a pictograph from Canyon de Chelly (or Shu lly), Arizona depicting “power lines” and spirits emanating from the head of a shaman. The linguistic connection of stone and head is found encoded in the word sar-I-tilai , or “golden head,” a mystical symbol used in Sufism. 22 Sar-I-tilai is a code word whose elements are well worth exploring. Sar is the Egyptian word for “Queen” and is the root for “serpent.” A serpent is exactly what we see hanging ( Tle ) from or within the hieroglyph of the golden pillar of Osiris and his queen Isis. I or i is symbolically a column or ‘pillar’. Tilai means Tula. Amalgamated, these terms render sar-I-Tilai as the Golden Head or the Golden Pillar of the Queen of Tula. The word Tulis means crucified. 22 It is probably the Golden Flower of Buddha.

Interestingly, the word Aesar (close to Osiris ), in Irish, literally means to kindle a fire. The name Isa means Lord or Master. The word asr , in Hebrew, has the signification of incantation, as in magic. 23 These definitions suggest a magical component to the Pillar of Osiris. It kindles the fire as if my magic. A pillar strikingly similar to Osiris’ Pillar of Love appeared in Sumeria c. 2,500 BC. Gods in flying vehicles and priests wearing fish suits frequently accompany this pillar. The secrets of the Healing Sun of the goddess Isis, and hence the secrets of Mystic Christianity and the Rosicrucians, centers on this Mystic Pillar , which derives its name from the pole, “the end of an axis ,” that is"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 321 polus in Latin. The Freemasons symbolized this celestial pole with the letter G . 24 ‘Axis’ rings of ‘exit’ (or ‘exodus’). It also rings of ‘access’, the root of ascend . Ascension, as we have seen, is related to levitation and Leviathon . The modern day rediscovery of this pillar may be for good reason. If the Mayans are correct, a moment of Exodus and Ascension may be upon us as Earth comes into alignment with the Healing Sun. Like the story of Jack and his Beanstalk, which also encodes the story of this magic tree, some may make an exit from the garden... possibly through a wormhole. Numerous important code words are derived from the “p-l-stem,” including A-PPLE , PALLas , PAL-estine (country of the Pali or axis), and PALLadium the name of this pillar in Rome and the gold alloy out of which it may have been lined. This atomic Tree, with its stimulating and nourishing power, was the Golden Flow-er of wisdom. It was the grand ornament in the Garden of the Gods whose pollen and kernels brought life. In the alchemical text, The Bahir (“Brightness”), Jewish mystics called this Tree a Teli , an axis or pole connecting the underworld with Earth and the heavens. 25 Significantly, Teli is from talah or TULA (or TLA), Hebrew for ‘hang’, ‘suspended’. Tela is web. Teli is also TLI. Another way to look at TLI would be as: T=300, L=50, and I=10. 26 TLI, therefore, is 360, a completed circle, O. O is also 360 degrees. Maize, or corn, is called tun (toon) by the Mayans, which is also their word for ‘stone’ and for 360 days. The Indian artists of North America symbolized the fifth element, the Quintessence, (or the Word, the “life force”), as an O. 27 often, they added specks inside the circle to show that it was full."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 322 ! When the circle was an empty O, one had to choose whether the life force was inside the circle, or in the entire universe outside its circumference! As evidenced by the illustration above, the Ancient Egyptians appear to have had a similar concept. Here, the Key of Life upholds the life force energy contained within the circle. In Mexico the seeker is everywhere met by divine names that refer to Hebrew and Greek names and end in tle . For example, the Greek word for God is Theo . In Mexico Teo -tle is Teo , ‘God’, 28 who is Tle (teli), ‘hung,’ ‘suspended’. There is even a crucified savior named Quetzalcoatl, who was known as the Peacemaker, and the ‘King of Tula’. His divine stone (or tone ), called teotecpatl , was an object of adoration. In Hebrew Mexico, or ME-si-co, would mean country of the msih or meshi, meaning Moses or Messiah . This name also rings of Massaw , who delivered the Great Spirit’s Life Plan and taught the secrets of corn. Massaw is a word that rings of the Aramaic meshiha , the Hebrew mahsiah , and the Greek messias . These words mean anointed . In Greek, ‘anointed’ is Christos . To the Hebrews, the Messiah is the expected king and deliverer. To the Christians, the Messiah is Jesus, the Christos."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 323 Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican Christ, is crucified and hung from a Cross.

Both statues suggest a wormhole connection. The Hopi await the return of this teacher and the reappearance of his sacred books. Pahana is sometimes written Bahana, a name that rings of Binah , Hebrew for ‘understanding’. ‘Understanding’ and ‘wisdom’ are two characteristics shared by the Messiahs of the Hebrews, Christians and the Hopi.

In addition, another most remarkable effect of the lifting of the serpent becomes obvious. Jesus declares: !!!! “I stand at the door, and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with Me.” 36 !!!!

What if it had the face of a bearded man that precisely matched that of the Shroud of Turin, which is widely believed to belong to Jesus? Would they accept him? Or would they fear him? !! Would they climb into his belly and cross the waters of Nun? Incredibly, we may not have long to wait for an answer.

This face on this standing serpent bears an uncanny resemblance to the face on the Shroud. Is it Jesus? In the book of John, Jesus says “the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.” 40 Jesus is talking about lifting up the standing serpent wave of the Healing Sun within himself. It was this obvious, but strangely, seldom acknowledged, truth, that led the Gnostics, who began as Caananite serpent worshippers, to present the Serpent in the Garden (E.A.) as the savior of mankind, the benevolent being who began the process by which mankind would be restored to their rightful status as gods. The Gnostics viewed Jehova (or the crafters of his image behind him) as a kind of malicious evil demon that had kept Man in a state of ignorance in the prison of the Garden. He did so that Man would not realize his own innate divinity, and at the same moment recognize that he was equal to or superior to his spiteful master. The Sumerians claim there was a conflict between the gods E.A. and Ninharsag, who sought to uplift humanity to the level of the gods, on the one hand and Enlil, E.A.’s half-brother, who sought to degrade humanity on the other. This conflict was expressed during the Inquisition when the Church attempted to eradicate the Gnostic teachings.

Jehova apparently did not wish for humanity to be travelling through the wormhole of the galaxy. As in the story of the Tower of Babel he (or his handlers) took drastic measures to destroy this link and insure humanity did not move forward. When Jesus came along and taught the myst eries of this wormhole his story had to be covered-up. It may even have led to his execution. As noted, after the Crucifixion Jesus’ family fled with what I term the Family Secrets. One repository of these secrets is believed to be Rennes-le- Chateau, France, a tiny village tucked away in the foothills of the Pyrenees in Cathar Country. The person most closely associated with these secrets is Mary Magdalene. On the west wall of the Church of Mary Magdalene in Rennes-le-Chateau Jesus is depicted standing on a mountain-top and beneath an arch composed of an entwined serpent pattern. At his feet is a bag of corn. Corn is a French slang term for gold. Is this the proverbial bag of gold at the end of the rainbow? The painting is called The Mountain of the Beatitudes (also known as Terrain Fleuri , “The Land of the Flowers”) a name which suggests a garden to me. It shows the Mount of Beatitude where Jesus gave his famous Sermon on the Mount or his 8 spiritual blessings, the Beatitudes. The Sermon on the Mount was said to have taken place at Lake Genesareth, a paradise. However, the painting in the church of Mary Magdalene unmistakably places this event on a cliff near Rennes-le-Chateau. Jesus stands on a hill covered with flowers. My theory is that Jesus is standing at the source of the Family Secrets. The artist who painted this picture seems to be indicating that these secrets are associated with the and that the contents of this arch fell into the soil at Rennes and produced ‘corn’."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 332 The Land of Flowers from Rennes-le-Chateau, France."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 333 17. DISCOVERING THE HEALING SUN WITHIN This is the last chapter of this book, but not the final chapter of this ongoing narrative. As I have shown, the rays of the Healing Sun have been known since the very beginning of religion. They form the basis for many of the world’s greatest religions. In conclusion, we will briefly explore the details of a story mentioned earlier; the story of Jacob resting his head on a stone and seeing a Ladder to Heaven. 1 The holy (s)tone upon which Jacob rested his head is evidence of knowledge of the code of the Healing Sun in his story and is instructive of these energies. The Bible clearly tells us the (s)tone had some exceptional power to alter Jacob’s brainwaves, thus inducing a deep state of trance or ecstasy. It is possible that Jacob had received some advanced wisdom that allowed him to communicate with the Lord through this special stone. This wisdom brought wisdom, health and healing. According to Hebrew tradition, this stone would also be the one that followed the Israelites in the desert and from which flowed the waters they drank of. 2 The ‘water’ ~ given from this vibrating ‘stone’ should be compared with the food provided by the Grail, the Cup of Love and Life, and the manna. According to Paul’s interpretation, 3 this anointed (s)tone was none other than Christ himself, whom Paul called the healing Son of God."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 334 He wields the rays of the Healing Sun, which are depicted as a standing serpent wave or as wavy lines. We know that the Key of Life from ancient times acted as a transmitter of holy tones from the Healing Sun. Could it have been the Key of Life that Jacob discovered hidden at Beth-El? Was this the (s)tone that altered his brainwaves? Or was it a corncob? Did Jacob (I A Cob) find a ME tablet or maize kernel that contained the brainwaves of God? Finally, can we relate Jacob’s story to the Galactic Core? The answer to this latter question is a definite yes. Jacob’s sacred spot, Bethel , meaning ‘house’, is the Semitic root for the baetylus , the omphalos stone or pillar that was also called bae-tulus. In the code it means ‘house or vessel of Tula’. Originally, the Bible tells us, Beth-El had a different name. The “name of the city was called Luz .” 4 This is curious in that the word luz means almond . 5 Mandorla means “almond,” and was one of the synonyms for the Ru , the Vessel of the Fish. 6 In esoteric tradition the almond had sacred overtones, and refers to something hidden, enclosed inviolable, particularly the mystery of light . This is not surprising. In the code the elements of mandorla are M’an, ‘sacred,’ dor or door, la or light -- ‘sacred door of light’. Had people seen doors of light at Luz before Jacob -- perhaps even the light of Tula? Is that why it was marked with special stones and discussed in sacred overtones? Luz was also applied to the name of an underground city and the indestructible kernel of being which carried within itself the seeds of its own resurrection. In Jewish folklore, it is at the foot of the almond-tree ( luz tree ) that access can be obtained to the mysterious city of Luz, which is one of the ‘Seats of the Immortals’. 7 Whether Luz is an"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 335 actual city, ala the underground facilities at Area 51, Nevada, Fermi Lab in Chicago, CERN in Switzerland, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Ontario, Canada, or if it is simply a deposit of a cosmic element from the Core hidden in the soil I will let the reader decide. Very striking in its import to revealing this part of the code is the Lord’s injunction to Moses to “lift up thy rod (ray) and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it,” allowing him to hold off the water of the Red Sea so that the Israelites would be able to walk (or tunnel?) through it on the dry ground. The prophet Jeremiah wrote of the Word of the Lord appearing to him, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And Jeremiah said, “I see the rod (ray) of the almond tree .” 8 My parenthesis added. Rods are rays, which are blossoms. Putting all this code together, we are able to surmise that when Jeremiah sees the Lord (the Door) and says he sees the blossoms of the almond he is seeing the hidden rays of light from the Door to Heaven. Presumably, Jacob saw these same rays at Luz, which was also called Tula. Rods, we should be aware, are also found in the retina of our eyes. The word retina means “the net.” “The retina,” says Gray’s Anatomy , “is a delicate nervous membrane, upon the surface of which the images of external objects are received.” 9 The retina is therefore a net for capturing light or a “light net.” It consists of ten layers, nine of which are labeled with Latin medical terms. The tenth part is called Jacob’s membrane , a layer of rods and cones. Why is this layer named after Jacob? Did some ‘in the know’ medical person so name it? My reason for this line of inquiry comes from another famous story in which Jacob wrestled with an angel and saw God face to face at a place called Peniel . 10 Mystics consider the pineal gland the ‘god part’ of the brain. What coded message concerning the brain’s mysterious pineal gland lays encoiled within this story?"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 336 The Tetractys. Does this pattern correspond with the ten layers of the retina of the eye? Intriguingly, the ten parts of the retina are also analogous to the Pythagorean Tetractys (above), which consists of ten dots -- •••••••••• -- in the form of a triangle. The Cabalists recognized the ten parts of the eye and found a correspondence between these and the globes upon the branches of the Sephirothic Tree of wisdom. According to the Cabalists, the Sephirothic Tree has 32 paths of Wisdom that correspond with the 31 nerves that emanated from the spinal cord (plus the 32nd which corresponds to the entire cranial nerve complex.). 11 The Mystery Schools of the past utilized means by which they ‘rattled’ the spinal cord so that the eye could ‘see’ many forms of energy. Science readily recognizes there are energies that we cannot see. Science has also shown that when a thing or energy is ready to be perceived a means to see it will emerge. This appears to be the message of Jacob’s experience."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 337 According to Pythagorean lore, the great philosopher from Greece was the person who possessed the Tetractys . Pythagoras took this symbol, known as the ‘pyramid of dots’, back to Italy with him where it became the symbol for his elite school and its teaching. Tetractys means kosmos. 12 In Greek, cosmos has the meaning of order, arrangement or ornament. Cosmos is linked with embroidery, which also means ornament. 12 To Pythagoras and his followers the Tetractys symbolized a map out of the labyrinth or embroidery of Earth life. Interestingly, in the code his name Pytho Gore Is means ‘serpent door (gore) of Isis’. Is the Tetractys the symbol for eternal life? Quite possibly. The God of Pythagoras was the Monad -- the One that is Everything, or the One Thing. 13 He taught that God was the One Thing distributed in tiny pieces or seeds throughout the universe. The ten dots of the Tetractys represented seeds or the female womb or egg to Pythagoras. Thus the dot-egg represented birth or new life. So important was this symbol to them, the followers of Pythagoras swore an oath on the Tetractys: “By him who gave to our soul the Tetractys, which hath the fountain and root of ever-springing nature.” The Tetractys, therefore, encodes the principles of re- G eneration. This undoubtedly was due to their belief that the Tetractys encoded a means to attune human consciousness to an ‘ever-springing’ Source or fountain of healing energies . This spring provided the energies that transformed the seed into a flower. This spring is the Healing Sun. If my theory is correct, it provided the energies that enabled Pythagoras to increase his physical powers as he aged."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 338 As I will show, the Tetractys is a map leading us to the Healing Sun. It provides the guiding aka string. First, it is important to note that, as depicted in the illustration shown here, the Tetractys of Pythagoras was later incorporated in depictions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The four-lettered Name of God is here arranged as a Tetractys within the inverted human heart. Beneath, the name Jehovah is shown transformed into Jehoshua or Joshua (Jesus) by the interpolation of the radiant Hebrew letter, Shin (sin). ‘Iesus Immanuel’ is written in the flames of the heart. The Sacred or Healing Heart of Jesus, a Cabalist figure by Jacob Boehme in which JHVH. The drawing as a whole represents the throne of God and His hierarchies within the heart of man. In describing the meaning of this code symbol, the forerunner of German metaphysicians, Jacob Boehme (1575-1624), stated that:"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 339 “For we have one book in common which points to God.

In this illustration of the Sacred Heart we see three rods or rays of light shed upon the Druidical circle composed of the entwined serpents. These serpents, which we have seen so many times in the previous pages, surround the heart, the Crown of Thorns.

In Egypt they symbolize the Lord of the Heart or Light of the World. 14 It is identical in meaning to the door or triangle. From this statement we may deduce that in the code the Tetractys and the Book of Love are one in the same. The code of the Tetractys is telling us that the treasure of immense value revered by the Cathars and others is in our own hearts, and that this symbol provides the key to opening our hearts to higher, healing energies. Unraveling the code of the Tetractys and the Sacred Heart and the means whereby we may open our hearts to receive the ‘treasures of wisdom’ of the Book of Love leads us to the Healing Sun. While I do not profess to definitively know what Pythagoras or Jesus was trying to teach, as the reader can see I am certainly attempting to find out! In my quest to penetrate the code of the Tetractys and the Healing Sun I found it helpful to don the and to adopt the wonder and trust of a child. I also used a few favorite children’s games: connecting dots, playing counting games, and suspending disbelief. Let us begin by counting the ten dots of the Tetractys as would the initiates of Pythagoras’ school. Starting from the top dot we count 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. The ten dots in four rows form one triangular form outlined in nine dots with a center point. Here we have the original • dot, or “point” within the center of the circle. This dot is the Cosmic Egg that released the primordial El-e-mental essence into the universe. When viewed from the top down, it is the radiant"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 341 eye • of light atop the pyramid. It signifies the Healing Sun. These nine dots remind me of the nine Mayan gods who popped out of the ‘serpent rope’ when it opened and the nine Ennead or Neters of the Egyptian tradition. In other words, the Tetractys appears to be a code symbol for the tunnel or wormhole connecting Earth and Tula. As noted, the Giza-Rostau complex was at the end of the ‘sacred road of the neters’ (star gods), suggesting it was a passageway used by the gods (including Jesus) to enter or exit the underworld (of Earth). The Mansion of the Phoenix symbolized the location of the Point of First Creation, where the first group of nine neter gods, known to the Egyptian priests of Heliopolis as the Great Ennead, made their entry on Earth. Ptah was leader of the Ennead. He and his assistants were the ‘sculptors’ of this tunnel. 15 The energy flow within the tunnel follows the ‘spiral or corkscrew effect’ found governing organic growth. When the energy is released it follows the beats of the children’s song, “One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All good children go to Heaven.” When we draw down this ‘essence ~ of Heaven’ it has a cleansing effect. In the Pistis Sophia Jesus told his followers: “Stay not your hand until ye find the cleansing mysteries which will cleanse you so as to make you pure light, that ye may go into the heights and inherit the light of my kingdom.” 16 This “cleansing,” actually the release of our inner spiritual power , was done through an initiation or attunement comprised of seven Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. In the code these lessons or “demons,” as they were called in the story of Jesus curing Mary Magdalene of possession by seven demons, 17 correspond with the"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 342 seven planetary spheres of the Pleiades. Egyptian texts allude to the Pleiades as the (star) gateway to Heaven 18 This star cluster in the constellation of Taurus the Bull has a tremendous wealth of lore and legend surrounding it. Most of this lore centers around the Mother symbol of the dove, the Pleiades being the mythological home of Dove- goddesses, who guarded the “gate” to the central point of heaven, Tula. In esoteric numerology and lore 666 represents the human soul’s incarnation on Earth. 777 is the number of the next dimensional overtone, and was considered by the ancients to be our soul’s next possible target destination. 777 represents the 7 stars of the Pleiades. This may explain why so many ancient temple complexes are aligned to this group of stars. In his tremendously superb book Jesus Christ: Sun of God , 19 David Fideler discusses Jesus’ relation to Tula, the Spiritual Sun or the Sun behind the Sun, and the numbers of Tula. In the Hebrew science of numbers called Gematria the spiritual number of Jesus, 8 or 888, is the same number as the Spiritual or Healing Sun. The Greek spelling of the name Jesus also amounts to the number 888. According to Gematria, the number of Earth life is six, the number of the Heaven is eight. In sacred geometry, the cube is the figure that unites Heaven and Earth. That is because a cube has six sides and eight corners. Fideler notes that the Christian mystery teachings were based upon the earlier teachings of Pythagoras and the Greeks. In an effort to preserve the continuity of the two teachings similar symbols were used. For example, Apollo was noted for his Stone of Light, the omphalos stone at Delphi, the center ( Tula ) of the Earth. This stone is echoed in the teaching of Jesus who"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 343 says “I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock (petra) I will build my church.” The Greek word for Peter is petros , rock. In the Clementine Homilies Simon Peter teaches that: • God possesses a shape that can be seen only by the pure of heart. • God underlies the structure of three-dimensional space. • God exists at the center ( Tula ) and heart of the universe and his form is that of the Cube or three- dimensional coordinate system. • From God radiates the six directions of space while he resides within the seventh point of rest. The six directions and the seventh point of rest. This center point is called the Rock of Living Waters, the Stone of Sure Foundation, the Pearl or jewel. In the example of the holographic cube it is the still or zero point •, the center place where our choice of love over fear is made. It is the Healing Sun. Fideler offers the illustration shown opposite, a cube in its isometric projection, to illustrate his point. Six rays fan out from the seventh inner point of the cube. The six rays with their connecting lines represent the world as we see it on Earth. The seventh, central, star is the revelation of the Pleiades, or 777."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 344 The cube in its isometric projection. The cube on its side represents seeing the cube of Earth life from a different perspective. Once we begin to see life on Earth as a product of our imagination (what the Buddhists call maya ) it opens us to the next level of our lives, or 777. The key to the ancient mysteries of Tula is revealed in the upper cube. Through this perspective 888 or an eighth, hidden Spiritual Sun, is revealed from which all souls flow. According to early Jewish philosophers, God resides in this “Sun behind the sun,” Tula."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 345 The tetractys is revealed as the cube on its side. It is a mind map to the Hidden or Black Sun. Pythagoras taught that both man and universe were made of the same One Thing. The law of correspondence - - As Above, So Below -- encapsulates his belief that by understanding the working of the above (the flower) we can understand the workings of the below (the seed). He believed there was a constant interplay between the Great Man (the universe) and man (the little universe). The law of correspondences was reflected in Pythagoras’ teaching that if two strings are tuned to the same frequency and one is plucked, the second will vibrate to the same resonance. This is the principle by which the standing serpent wave of Aslcepius works, and by which the Tetractys places us in resonance with the higher energies of Tula. By providing a map for capturing the energies of Tula, the Tetractys places us in ‘harmonic attunement’ or resonance"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 346 with Tula’s wellspring of energies. Let us remember that we each have a thread to link with Tula. The myths and scripture I have presented raise another provocative question: do we each have a twin soul on the other end of an umbilical cord located at Tula, the home of our souls? Can we connect with this soul through a specific body posture? Will this connection give us a ‘flow of healing blood’, the Blood of Life? If so, can we connect with this Higher Self through a prayer posture? The evidence we have considered would most certainly lead us to believe so. We are not alone. In the Nordic tradition, the ka was a hidden twin-soul thought to reside in the placenta or umbilical cord. The Nordic artist who carved it on the illustration shown here knew the Egyptian ka position. As we will see later, this is the prayer posture that links us with the energies of the Healing Sun. Norse etching on a tombstone now found at Saint Peters Church, Heysham, Lancashire, England, 7 th -8 th century AD."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 347 The Mayans also knew this prayer posture, as well. It is modeled by the four ba-cab (or ba- ka b) figures. The Bacabs are holding up the World. In fact, as we saw ever since humans started drawing on cave walls 40,000 or so years ago the ka or key posture and the serpent, symbolizing the G energy that created the world, and perhaps souls, has been on the mind of storytellers. In a follow-up book Discovering the Healing Sun Within: The Spiritual Psychology of the Healing Sun I present additional techniques for connection with the Heavenly Twin. In closing, it is my hope that this book will help you in your own quest to break through the borderland dividing the human and divine into the realm of the Healing Sun. One of my favorite songs is U2’s “A Sort of Homecoming” from The Unforgettable Fire . 20 Bono weaves a vision of the ‘fields of morning’ and a ‘light that’s in the distance’. He sings of a time to heal when the Earth moves and on borderland we run. This song was inspired by U2’s sorrow for the A-bomb blast that ended WWII. Long before Bono another poet, Longfellow, took up the idea of the borderland. In “Hermes Trismegistus,” he wrote: Who in his own Skill confiding, Shall with rule and line Mark the border-land dividing Human and Divine?"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE HEALING SUN CODE 348 REFERENCES INTRODUCTION: THE GREAT NOISE FROM HEAVEN 1. www.bell-labs.com/news/1998/june/4/2.html . 2.
