The Capitol houses the chambers of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Standing in front of this breath - t a k i n g s t r u c t u r e e v o k e s a w e a n d excitement. Its power is palpable, even to less sensitive visitors. To Americans, the cast - iron, Capitol dome, dressed in pure white sandstone, is a sacred symbol of strength and democracy. Radiant. Luminous. Shining. Freedom rings from this beautiful bell. The Capitol is the house that George Washington built. It was co - conceived and gestated by Thoma s Jefferson. These Founding Fathers believed that the U.S. Constitution was written to “secure the Blessings of Liberty.” Writing in 1812 to Benjamin LaTrobe, the Capitol’s architect, Je ff erson referred to the Capitol as “the first temple dedicated to the sovereignty of the people.” He also called the Virginia Capitol a “temple of sovereignty.” Hardly one to mince words, Je ff erson obviously v i e w e d t h e C a p i t o l a s a p l a c e o f communion with the divine, a house of the holy. Is the U.S. Capitol actually a temple? In our quest to answer this question, we discovered that indeed it is. At the core of this living and continually evolving civic temple is Je ff erson’s Enlightened vision of Liberty as the new secular religion of Light. The mighty Capitol Hill is a great High Hill, in the tradition of all holy hills. The temple atop this mount emerges as a Te m p l e o f E n l i g h t e n m e n t a n d Tr a n s f o r m a t i o n t h a t u s e s s a c r e d architectural principles and spiritual symbolism to create a magnificent space or place where Heaven and Earth unite. By definition it is a gateway, a stargate, to use a 21 st century term. We’ll refer to it as Freedom’s Gate. We will introduce you to a secret vision of the U.S. Capitol as a holy place and to an alchemical code we discovered concealed within its focal painting, “The Apotheosis of George Washington.” Once the symbolism of the Apotheosis is revealed we think you’ll agree that the spiritual meaning of the Capitol is obvious. Like the secrets of the Light and the All - Seeing Eye on the back of the Great Seal of the United States of America, prominently displayed on the back of the one dollar bill, it is hidden in plain sight. As we illuminate the wonders, the mystical symbols and the secrets encrypted within this temple/gate and the Apotheosis , our hope is that this sacred and beautiful white mountain will shine in the ways it was intended by its builders, as a source of light, radiance, and a beacon of hope for the new millennia. While this book will only discuss the U.S. Capitol, with an emphasis on its D o m e , w e r e c o g n i z e i t s f u n c t i o n i s interconnected and works seamlessly with the overall visionary Masonic lay - out of Washington, D.C. As numerous authors have documented, the ten - square - mile diamond - shaped energy matrix carved out of Maryland and Virginia and known as the Federal District or Federal City is an energetic matrix/power center vibrating frequency and power throughout the entire world. Follow - up books will explore this matrix."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\r 9 WILLIAM HENRY is an investigative mythologist and author of 14 books and numerous DVD presentations.

We consult no common oracle but the Constitution.\" Inscription in the House Wing of the Capitol, 1830s Rufus Choate, Massachusetts Co ngressman On December 2, 2008, the largest project ever in the U.S. Capitol’s more than two centuries - long history of evolution was opened to the public. The stunning $ 621 million marble and stone underground Capitol Visitor’s Center doubled its footprint. Stephen T. Ayers, the Architect of the Capitol, hopes it will quickly become the gateway for visitors to the Capitol. In his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid quipped that members will no longer have to “smell the tourists” on hot summer days. He added, “Today the ‘ people's temple ’ shines brighter than ever before...” The opening drew heavy criticism in conservative circles for minimizing references to God and to religious faith and for emphasizing the Capitol as a “People’s Temple” ( in fact its “sole temple” ) and the Constitution as America’s “oracle.” An oracle is a shrine consecrated to worship where a prophetic revelation, also called an oracle, is given by a holy person. This revelation ( or oracle ) is thought of as coming from God. Is the Capitol really a temple? Is the U.S. Constitution a God - given revelation?"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\r 2 U.S. Senator Jim DeMint ( R – S.C. ) criticized the Capitol Visitor Center design in a press release, charging “it fails to appropriately honor our religious herita ge that has been critical to America’s success.” Noting that the Architect of the Capitol has pledged to include “some references to faith,” DeMint continued: “More needs to be done. You cannot accurately tell the history of America or its Capitol by ignoring the religious heritage of our Founders and the generations since who relied on their faith for strength and guidance. The millions of visitors that will visit the Capitol Visitor Center each year should get a true portrayal of the motivations and inspirations of those who have served in Congress since its establishment.” We agree with Senator DeMint. Americans should have a true portrayal of the motivations and inspirations of those who built the Capitol and who provided us with the oracle known as the U.S. Constitution. Here they are in their own words. Thomas Je ff erson, the Capitol’s chief visionary, called it “the first temple dedicated to the sovereignty of the people.” An anonymous essay of 1795 described the Capitol building as a ‘temple erected to Liberty’. Specifically, the founders of the Capitol Temple likened it to Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. Maryland Grand Master Joseph Clark, September 18, 1793, at the laying of the cornerstone of the Capitol: “I have every hope that the grand work we have done today will be handed down...to a late posterity, as the like work of that ever memorable templ e to our order erected by our ancient Grand Master Solomo n .” An angel holds the U.S. Constitution, “America’s oracle,” beside Justice in Old Supreme Court, 1817.

These words are more than poetic. The U.S. Capitol has numerous architectural and other features that unquestionably identify it with ancient temples including stone construction, a n u n d e r g r o u n d e n t r a n c e , chapels, an image of a deified being, numerous ima ges of h e a v e n l y b e i n g s , r e l i g i o u s i m a g e r y, s y m b o l s a n d i n s c r i p t i o n s , d i v i n e proportions, sacred geometry, massive columns, palpable spiritual energy, acoustic trickery, terrifying guardians, mystic visitors, closed doors, private members, secret chambers, and an orientation to the Sun.

The measurements for this orientation were made from the location of the center of t h e d o m e o f t h e U. S. Ca p i to l , rendering it a ‘solar temple’. Its a l i g n m e n t a n d e n c o d e d numerology point to the Sun as well as the stars. A golden circle on the Rotunda story and a white star in the Crypt ( right ) marks this spot. Author David Ovason imagines it as the center of a compass and as a point of stillness, where the arc of the sunset is “centered.” This still star point is the power dot in Liberty’s Temple that radiates the abstract, even transcendent, concepts of Freedom and Liberty into the heart of America and beyond. Capping the solar connection is the painting in the Eye of the Dome portraying George Washington sitting in a “Sun Gate” ( more momentarily ) . It is crystal clear that the builders viewed the Capitol as America’s sole temple: a solemn, Solomon’s Solar Temple to be exact. As we will show, America’s Holy House, the U.S. Capitol, is indeed modeled after Solomon’s Temple. A temple is, of course, a place of worship -- “the house of the holy.” Temple is also a word for the flat part on either side of the human head above and beyond the eye. The origin of this form of the word temple is obscure to scholars. However, it is thought to derive from the Latin word tempus or “time.” Tempo and temporal are derived from the same root. The word templu m technically refers to the drawing of the building, not the stone version. Often, these drawings were transmitted by the gods directly to humans ( more momentarily ) . Scholars trace the origins of the ‘other’ temple to the sixth century AD Latin tempus , “divided place.” Temples were sacred spaces of a city or town set - apart or divided from the ordinary reality by an auger or priest. While we today use the word temple for any stand alone holy place, di ff erent words were used in ancient times for these ‘o ff limits to humans’ places. For instance, in ancient Egypt the house of the gods was called per neter. In Greece, the gods were worshipped in temenos meaning ‘sacred precinct’. The ancient Hebrews referred to the ‘sanctuary’ of God or the “Beth El”, House of El ( ‘Shining Ones’ ) . Webster’s cites the Holy of Holies of Solomon’s Temple ( 1 Kings 6: 16, 19 - 23 ) , which housed the Ark of the Covenant, as a prime example of an oracl e . Perhaps the poet Solomon and his Ark inspired Henry James’ words in The America n Scene , where he described the U.S. Capitol, a s t h e “ a r k o f t h e Am e r i c a n c o v e n a n t , ... a s a compendium of all the nation’s terms and standards, weights and measures and emblems of greatness and glory...” Cherubim guarding the Ark of the Covenant with its rainbow arch.

The Ark of the Covenant, says the Book of Exodus, was a communications tool or oracular device used by Israelite High Priests to contact YHWH, who appeared in (rainbow) Glory on the Throne of Mercy between the Ark’s winged cherubim.

These temples become gateways for these deities to journey between heaven and earth and to communicate with humankind. In addition, they become ‘power centers’ radiating ( spiritual ) energy. According to Jewish tradition, Solomon’s Temple acted as a “footstool” for God’s presence ( shakina ) in our world. Is it, therefore, surprising to learn, that the Capitol building had been used as a church for years befor e it was occupied by Congress? The cornerstone for the Capitol had been laid on September 18, 1793; two years later, while still under construction, the July 2, 1795 Federal Orrery newspaper of Boston reported: City of Washington, June 19. It is with much pleasure that we discover the rising consequence of our infant city. Public worship is now regularly administered at the Capitol, every Sunday morning, at 11 o'clock by the Reverend Mr. Ralph. The reason for the original use of the Capitol as a church might initially be explained by the fact that there were no churches in the city at that time. The magnificent dome of the Capitol seals its destiny as a holy place. Domes have been called the perfect architectural shape: the circle, symbol of the universe, executed in three dimensions. Solomon’s Temple with domed roof and obelisks. From a Masonic Songbook, United Grand Lodge of England. Judeo-Christian End Time prophecy envisions the construction of The Third Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem associated with the coming of the Jewish Messiah or Messianic Era. It may have a dome as envisioned by Freemasons. In religious architecture domes proclaim the glory of God. In fact, the word dom e comes from Latin domus , a house, via Italian duomo , a house of God, that is a church ( from kir k , meaning ‘circle’ ) . Dome is also slang for head. The oculus or eye of the dome ( head ) is considered the Gateway to the Sun. From this gateway at the top of the dome rises the World Axis ( Freedom ) , the link between Heaven and Earth. Domes, therefore, are the threshold of the spiritual world. No matter where they appear."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"\r 8 Crossing cultures, the dome is a cosmic symbol. It is equivalent to the stupa of India and China. A stupa ( Sanskrit meaning “heap” ) is a mound - like s t r u c t u r e c o n t a i n i n g B u d d h i s t r e l i c s . It s hemispheric shape represents the World Egg and the womb. The relics placed inside the stupa symbolize the seed of life. Later, the stupa became a symbol of Buddha’s final release from the cycle of birth and rebirth. As the stupa diagram ( top left ) and the “Great Stupa” of Sri Lanka ( right ) show, a conical spire or ‘steeple’ emerges f rom the stupa. Called the World A x i s o r Wo r l d P i l l a r, i t i s a c o n n e c t i o n o r l i n k b e t w e e n E a r t h a n d Heaven. The axis is located where the four compass directions meet ( as they do in the Crypt of the Capitol ) making it sacred above all other places. The sacred tree, the vine, and the tower elegantly encode this symbolism. Anything suspended from the Axis, a serpent or a fruit, for example, b e co m e s a s y m b o l e n co d i n g t h e h e a v e n l y knowledge. Buddhists believe the building of a stupa brings good fortune. A universally told story is that of the seeker/traveler who builds and then scales the Axis, Pillar or Ladder to Heaven to retrieve the knowledge of the heavenly beings. Jacob did this in the Bible. In Genesis 28:12 Jacob prepares to dream by piling a heap ( or stupa ) of stones. In his dream, he sees a ladder or stairway with angels ascending and descending upon it. He scales the ladder to Heaven and returns. He is now a free man who changes his name to Israel. With an “opened eye.” the initiated traveler beholds the dome as a grand stair way that reaches from Earth to Heaven. We will explore several traditions later that merge the human body with the stairway symbolism. The stupa and dome create a spiral or vortex of energy that spins around a central axis. The U.S. Capitol Dome is stupa-like. Freedom tops the Dome."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"\r 9 Freedom stands atop the Capitol Dome on the tholos , Greek for ‘round temple’.

According to the oldest symbolism, the circle enclosing a dot represented the primal womb containing the spark of creation. A Dome is female energy like a womb or a tomb. The phallic obelisk symbolizes male energy. Together, the obelisk/rod and the ring/dome, like the unity of male and female, births a third entity, ‘spiritual energy’ or Earth’s subtle energies. The Vatican and U.S. Capitol complexes utilize these energies. Dating back to Neolithic times, spirals were connected with spaces revered as spiritual energy spots and with thresholds (wombs/gates) between death and rebirth. Serpents symbolized this transformative energy. There are over 30 serpent images on or in the U.S. Capitol. They symbolize the spiritual or natural energy flowing through this temple/space.

One o ffi cial publication about the Dome, The Dome of the United States Capitol: A n Architectural History , warns against making too much of its symbolism. The founders were much more practical than mystical or spiritual, it claims. Still, we are encouraged to take a poet’s view, and even a prophet’s view, of the Capitol Temple. Congressman James Wilson of Pennsylvania prophesied in 1787 that America’s new federal government would “lay a foundation for erecting temples of Liberty in every part of the earth.” An 18 th century poet, Benjamin Russell, envisioned the Capitol’s dome in his tome, “The Birth of Columbia,” published on December 3, 1788: Behold the FEDERAL DOME majestick rise!

Such protection was o ff ered by the Constitution, which, when ratified, would be like a “heaven - descended DOME, supporting and supported by the noble structure.” Freestanding columns were among the earliest symbols of the federal government. Together they supported “the beauteous DOME” that signified the Constitution. It is thought that this imagery probably contributed to Washington’s desire for a domed capitol.

All three drew heavily from Ancient Egypt where, at Judgement Day, the heart is weighed against a feather on the scales of Maat , or ‘Divine Justice’. The soul advances if the heart weighs less than the feather. In Christian eschatology, the Last Judgment, Final Judgment, Judgment Day, or Day of the Lord is the judgment by God of all nations. It will take place after the resurrection of the dead and the Second Coming (Revelation 20:12-15) This belief has inspired numerous artistic depictions. The iconography of the \"Last Judgment\" is drawn from many passages from the apocalyptic chapters of the Bible. Specifically, in the Sheep and Goats section of the Matthew’s Gospel where the judgment is entirely based on help given or refused to \"the least of these\". “ When the Son of Man comes in His glory , and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory , says Matthew 25:31. In Last Judgment scenes, Jesus is frequently seen on or in a rainbow. Hence, the rainbow is associated with glory. This makes sense. Symbolically, rainbows are intermediaries between heaven and earth. They are bridges the gods use to toggle between the worlds. The gods glow rays of light, especially rainbow rays. “All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and He will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left. Then the king will say to those at His right hand, “Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.” ... “Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.” Then He will say to those at His left hand, “You that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not give me clothing, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.” ... “Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.” And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” (Matthew 25:32-36, 40-43, 45-46 NRSV) The Last Judgment originates in the Egyptian concept of the Duat , detailed in texts such as the Book of Gates.

Like the starry hat of Attis (and of America), these star-strewn cloaks signified the soul in its highest aspects. Through this process the Mysteries of humanity’s perfect heavenly nature were conferred transforming the initiate from an earthly to a heavenly being. The earthly body was transmuted into a celestial or star body, i.e. a light body. America’s star cloak, therefore, symbolizes the cloak of many colors or the Rainbow Body.

Brumidi, the Vatican and the Capitol Brumidi’s Masterpiece Born in Rome on July 26, 1805 to a Greek father and an Italian mother, Constantino Brumidi began his study of art at age thirteen when he was accepted at the acclaimed Accademia di San Luca. He spent the early years of his artistic life in the most powerful and prestigious center of artistic patronage, Rome. In 1832, at the age of twenty seven, Brumidi wed Maria Covaluzzi, a widow nearly ten years his senior. They had a daughter, Maria Elana. Destiny intervened in 1837 when, during the next ten months, Brumidi wife and mother died. Brumidi remarried in October, 1838. His second wife, Anna, was sixteen; he was thirty - three. Their son, Giuseppe, was born four years later. In the 1840s Brumidi settled into his family and his career. His artistic talents were recognized when he was commissioned by Pope Gregory XVI and later by Pope Pius IX to restore some of the Vatican frescos painted during the sixteenth century. This project brought him notice as the best painter in Rome."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"\r 34 Throughout the 1840s Brumidi painted extensivel y in Rome mo ving f rom the Vatican to another prestigious assignment, the Palazzzo Torlonia, a palace described by historians and art critics as one of the most beautiful buildings of eighteenth century Rome. Brumidi’s 1847 full - length portrait of Pope Pius IX, whom he befriended, elevated his stature in the Vatican. His star was on the rise. Then, destiny intervened once more. On November 15, 1848 the Papal States were temporarily over throne by revolutionaries hoping to install a new Roman Republic and with it a Constitution enabling the free practice of all religions in Rome ( not just Ju d a i s m f o r t h o s e b o r n Je w i s h a n d Christianity ) . Rome was spun into chaos and violence with gangs looting, raping and pillaging at will. The pope fled the Vatican. The revolution did not last. On April 25, 1849 a coalition of European armies led by French troops intervened to restore order. The pope and the Holy See regained power in July 1850 and condemned the revolution. Brumidi supported the movement to depose Pope Pius IX as the political power in favor of a republic. In 1851, at the age of forty - six, Brumidi was arrested as one of a group of revolutionary leaders under Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian Freemason who led the ill - fated revolution. As Captain of the National Guard Brumidi had refused to obey certain orders against his friends which resulted in the enmity of Cardinal Antonelli, Minister of State. Additionally, he was charged with committing grand larceny, aggravated assault, looting churches and convents and with conspiracy to destroy the Catholic Church. At his trial, Brumidi’s lawyer provided evidence that his actions were intended to protect valuable Church art work, rather than to steal it. Several monks provided a ffi davits supporting Brumidi’s case. Still, he was found guilty by the Vatican court and sentenced to eighteen years in prison. Several weeks later Brumidi’s sentence was reduced to six years. Within sixty days, on March 20, Pope Pius IX quietly granted him a pardon on the condition that the artist leave Italy and never return. Within six months Brumidi was on a ship headed for New York. He left Rome without his wife Anna and children, then twenty and ten years old. Constantino Brumidi."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"\r 35 Behind the scenes, Brumidi knew he would be working for the Jesuits in New York. In his trial testimony he mentioned that he had been selected by Archbishop John Hughes to work at St. Stephen’s in New York City. John Hughes, an Irish immigrant gardener who became the first Archbishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of New York, was one of the most influential and controversial Americans of his time. He received the pallium, the woolen band that was the symbol of his new authority, directly from Pope Pius IX, a sign of the growing importance within the Church of American Catholics in general, of New York’s Catholics in particular, and of Hughes himself. He had a dream of creating a magnificent cathedral in New York. He needed the great painter to help. Hughes sailed for Rome in the autumn of 1851 and was introduced to Brumidi in Rome by Superior General John Roothaan of the Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits, a religious society formed in 1559 by the Spaniard, Ignatius Loyola, who had a mystical vision of Christ. Some call the Jesuits the Pope’s private militia. The Superior General is referred to as Father General or President General. The position carries the nickname ‘Black Pope’, after his basic black robes, as contrasted by the Pope’s flashy gold and white. However, during Brumidi’s time this figure was seen by European and American Protestants as the secret or hidden power within the Church. Like Hughes, Roothaan, also from New York, saw great potential in bringing Brumidi to New York. This is how the man who would paint the dome of the U.S. Capitol came to America. As recorded in the Bible given to him by the American Bible Society upon his arrival, Brumidi landed in New York on September 18, 1852. A burly five foot five man with a bushy beard and ebullient personality, Brumidi was a man on a mission when he arrived in the City. He wanted to become a United States citizen. On November 29 he filed for citizenship with the New York Court of Common Please. “I no longer have any desire for fame and fortune,” he remarked upon arriving in the United States. \"My one ambition and my daily prayer is that I may live long enough to make beautiful the Capitol of the one country on earth in which there is liberty”. Manhattan was a raucous place when Brumidi arrived. The “nativists,” as the highly organized anti - Catholics were called, included Protestant fundamentalists who saw the Catholic Church as the handiwork of Satan and superstition, intellectuals who considered Catholicism incompatible with democracy, ethnocentric cultural purists who believed the United States should be a land for Anglo - Saxons. While he may not have been enthusiastically greeted by the “nativists,” Brumidi was welcomed by the elite of Manhattan. His commissions included a number of portraits for wealthy individuals. However, his major employer was the Jesuits. Brumidi painted for the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius in Baltimore. Another Jesuit commission was the altarpiece for the Church of St. Aloysius on North Capitol Street near the Capitol. Archbishop Hughes spoke at the dedication of this piece. Hughes was also present when Brumidi unveiled the Crucifixio n in fresco at the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul in Philadelphia. He continued to work for the Jesuits concurrently with his work in the Capitol virtually until his death in 1880. However, it was the Eye of Dome of the U.S. Capitol where Brumidi would make history. ."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"\r 36 Designed in 1854 by prominent Philadelphia architect Thomas U. Walter, the Dome is a stunning orchestration of columns, pilasters, and windows crowned by a 19.5 - foot tall statue of the goddess Freedom. Congress instantly commissioned construction after it saw the architect’s sensational renderings of the Dome ( see page 2 ) . Captain Montgomery C. Meigs was the engineer in charge of construction of the New Dome and the Capitol’s expansion. He had envisioned a grand decorative program for the Capitol, inspired by his research on the Vatican and the villas of Pompeii. With his Vatican experience Brumidi was a perfect match. The two met on December 28, 1854. Meigs invited Brumidi to do a test fresco. The work — depicting the popular subject of the Roman General Cincinnatus — was a success, and Brumidi was hired to decorate the Capitol. He began work in 1855, and continued to paint the corridors, committee rooms and ceremonial spaces of the Capitol extension until his death in 1880. George Washington has been called the American Cincinnatus. A few words about this Roman hero will help us understand the importance of this painting in establishing Brumidi’s understanding of the ‘mythic’ Washington. Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus ( 519 BC – 430 BC ) was a politician in Rome who served as consul in 460 BC. He was one of the heroes of early Rome and was a model of Roman virtue and simplicity. In 458 B.C. Rome was under attack. Cincinnatus, a farmer, was nominated as dictator to rally the Empire. Victorious, his enemies defeated, Cincinnatus, the leader of the most powerful army on Earth then relinquished his position and handed over his toga to the Senate and returned to his fields until he was called upon once more. Once again, he laid down his power to return to a life of virtuous simplicity. This story has elements of the great temptation of Jesus by Satan in Luke 4:5 - 8. Satan o ff ered Jesus all the kingdom’s of the world, if he bowed down and worshipped Satan.” In those days the Roman Empire ruled the majority of the world. Jesus declined, saying, “It is written: Worship the Lord your god and serve him only.” George Washington served as the first President of the Society of Cincinnati, a military hereditary society named in honor of the virtuous Roman. Like Cincinnatus, the Father of America, Washington, was a farmer ( and whiskey - maker ) who rose to power to save his fledgling country and then retired to his farm after the American Revolution. Like Cincinnatus, he was called upon once again to serve his country, which he did. At that time Washington could have demanded a kingship or to serve as president for life, both of which he refused, citing his interest in the public good when he retired from the presidency after just two terms. When asked to serve a third term as president, Washington declined, breaking the chain of power that leads to dictatorships and monarchies. Brumidi’s first painting in the U.S. Capitol memorializes the Senators coming to Cincinnatus asking for help. Washington resigns his commission in this painting found in the Capitol Rotunda.

The story takes place in the 8th century B.C. (Romulus reigned 753-717 B.C.). Plutarch ( Life of Numa Pompilius) tells how Romulus gathered the Senate and the populace in a open field. Suddenly, the sky darkened, a thick cloud of storm and rain settled on the earth; the common people fled in terror, and were dispersed; and in this whirlwind Romulus disappeared, his body being never found either living or dead. After one of the Senator calmed the mass of people, he told the assembled Romans that he had seen Romulus being carried up into the heavens. Romulus, the Senator said, had called out that he was going to live with the gods, and wished his people to worship him as the god Quirinus. The ancients constructed the first Pantheon on that site. They dedicated it to Romulus and some of his divine ancestors and, for centuries, held rites and processions there."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"\r 38 View from the East Front of the U.S. Capitol.

He had stunned the world with the Sistine Ceiling, that was completed in 1512. The Sistine Chapel, one of the best known in the world, is a high rectangular brick building the internal measurements of which are 40.9 meters ( 134 ft ) long by 13.4 meters ( 44 ft ) wide — the dimensions of the Temple of Solomon as given in the Old Testament.

The ladder links Jerusalem, specifically the site of Solomon’s Temple, with the stories of ascension to the heavenly realms from this site. The Koran links the Prophet Muhammad with Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The seventeenth Sura, entitled 'The Night Journey', relates that Muhammad was carried by night ' from the sacred temple to the temple that is most remote, whose precinct we have blessed, that we might show him our signs...' Muslim belief identifies the two temples mentioned in this verse as being in Mecca and Jerusalem. According to tradition, Muhammad's mystic night journey was in the company of the Archangel Gabriel, and they rode on a winged steed called El Burak (meaning `lightning') which, according to Islamic Hadith tradition, was a winged, horse-like creature. Stopping briefly at Mt. Sinai and Bethlehem, they finally alighted at Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and there encountered Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets, whom Muhammad led in prayers. Gabriel then escorted Muhammad to the pinnacle of the rock, which the Arabs call as-Sakhra , where a ladder of golden light or a golden rope materialized. On this glittering shaft, Muhammad ascended through the seven heavens into the presence of Allah, from whom he received instructions for himself and his followers. Following his divine meeting, Muhammad was flown back to Mecca by Gabriel and the winged horse, arriving there before dawn.

One tenet of Deism is the belief that man can achieve apotheosis and become self - actualized as a god by following a path of mental, physical, emotional and spiritual development. This idea originated in the pre - Christian Gnostic Mystery Schools of antiquity, particularly of ancient Egypt, and later, Palestine. It is opposed by the Church of Rome, which upholds belief in Christ as the exclusive entry to Heaven. The cosmic ideas expressed in the Apotheosis are found throughout the ancient world. In the Hebraic cabbala, the Rainbow Throne or Rainbow Body is described as the Merkaba or Throne of Glory — the perfect dwelling place of the Lord. It is the supreme and pure Tabernacle or Temple in which the Messianic Presence of the Lord God may dwell and be manifested. According to Gnostic teaching, the Merkaba is a soul body, envisioned as a chario t , that must be built in order to enter Heaven. Once constructed or made ( ‘identified’ ) , a person is born anew. Frequently, the apotheosized or ascended being is depicted riding amongst the stars in his Merkaba, shown as a cosmic Sun chario t or winged chariot. This is the case with Elijah who ascends to the heavens in his heavenly sun chariot drawn by star horses and with George Washington in the statue Car of History, located in Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol.

The gods whirl and spin through space on flying vehicles like this. In some stories, not only the gods and their star chariots, but also their often domed temples soared into space or into the spiritual world. The Hindu epic Mahabarata says that Arjuna, in his journey aboard a “Divine Chariot, brilliant like the Sun” traveled through the galaxy to visit his father, Indra, “chief of the gods” and saw “wondrous chariots by the thousands” out in space. They shown with their own light.

It might possibly suit modern Italian taste, but certainly it did not the American taste.” Citing poor lighting conditions, Greenough petitioned for the statue to be moved out of the Rotunda.

Yet this is exactly what Greenough intended. The right hand pointing heavenward, says the sculptor, created a “double gesture...to convey the idea of an entire abnegation of Self and to make my hero as it were a conductor between God and Man.” In the subtext we may read, ‘Washington is a divine interceder or channel. America’s success is divinely guided.’ Greenough also envisioned the work as a symbolic representation of Washington as a great exemplar of liberty and republican democracy. The tell - tale symbol is the sword in Washington’s outstretched hand. It’s tilted toward the viewer. This celebrates the fact that after he led the country to victory in the American Revolution, he selflessly relinquished his power to the people.” Interestingly, Vivien Fryd refers to this statue as “the apotheosis of abnegation” or resignation of power. As Greenough explained in a letter to Samuel F.B. Morse, in 1834, “Washington’s face and form are identified with the salvation of the continen t .” As Fryd observes, Greenough is implying that Washington is a new Messiah. In our view, his secret destiny, and that of America, is encoded in Brumidi’s dome. A circular opening about ten feet in diameter (now covered, above left) had been left by the builders of the Capitol in the center of the Rotunda. It was anticipated that visitors would peer through the opening into the crypt below to see a statue of Washington that was to be placed in his tomb. The crypt of the United States capitol was designed to hold the body of George Washington. It is also the centerpiece of Washington, D.C., since it is the dividing point for the quadrants of the city. However, due to an issue with Washington’s estate, his remains were entombed at his home, Mount Vernon, rather than in the Capitol. “The sword,” wrote Greenough, “to which objections are made, cleared the ground where our political fabric was raised.”"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"\r 68 Greenough was an American sculptor who lived in Florence, Italy. His college years at Harvard incited a passion for works of antiquity. When he moved to Rome to study art he focused on the Renaissance. Two works he studied in the Vatican gallery are cited as having made an impression on the young artist. The first is the Pythian Apollo , a marble sculpture from Classical Antiquity that was discovered during the Renaissance. It depicts the Greek sun god Apollo with a python, which he has subdued or enchanted. The second is the statue of Laocoön and His Sons , also called the Laocoön Group. It shows the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being strangled by sea serpents. Laocoön was a priest of Poseidon (or of Apollo by some accounts) at Troy. In Greek mythology, Poseidon is the brother of Zeus and the priest-king of Atlantis. His symbol is the trident. Perhaps as an homage to Poseidon, Greenough placed a trident on the throne of Washington (top, right). The Laocoön statue was discovered in 1506 on the site of the Golden House of the Emperor Nero (who ruled from 54 to 68 AD) and may even have belonged to him. The discovery of the Laocoön made a huge impact on Italian Renaissance sculptors, including Michaelangelo. The murals in the Golden House were discovered by Raphael.

L’Orange points toward an answer. He notes that deeply rooted in the ancient mind was the idea that divine powers were able to make special contact with chosen human beings. Poetry, myth, legend and history o ff er numerous examples of human beings who had intercourse with the gods, who received counsel from them, who strengthened and protected them in battle. Egyptian pharaohs, Old Testament prophets, kings like Minos and Zoroaster piloted kingdoms and formulated constitutions under the guidance of divine powers. Then there’s Alexander the Great, who was elevated from man to god man. He is considered the son of Zeus Ammon, a second Dionysus, a second Hercules, the Greek savior who was an earthly incarnation of Zeus. After his death he is glorified. He is apotheosized. Coins show him w i t h t h e r a m’s h o r n o f A m m o n . H e h a s transfigured into Sol or Apollo. L’Orange observes that Hellenistic Kings and Roman emperors endeavored to live up to the Alexander ideal not only in their actions, but also in their outward appearance.

In our view, George Washington is another in a long succession of Alexandrian warrior - kings who embodied the “Son of Zeus” archetype, and hence, were deified.

Washington is thought of not only as Zeus, but just like Alexander, also as Hercules.

In the Timaeus he tells of the lost civilization of Atlantis and states this loss rendered us as children. Inspired by Plato, Renaissance thinkers such as Descartes, Francis Bacon, John Dee and Sir Isaac Newton began an all out search for the “lost pure knowledge” or the original Divine Science. Bacon, in particular, believed in a return to the state before the Fall of Adam, a state of pure and sinless contact with nature and knowledge of her powers. Soon, it became evident to these seekers that embedded within the biblical stor y of King Solomon and his Temple were vital clues to the Divine Science.

Newton’s science would give rise to a larger religious phenomenon, Deism , a radical revamping of Christianity which is founded on the idea that the soul can become enlightened or perfected and reason is the way into the mind of God. Drawing on Newton’s visualization of the Universe as a giant clock built by the Deity or Creator and then set it motion, the Deists believed that all phenomena are fundamentally rational and mechanistic and can be explained in non - religious terms and understood solely by means of reason ( rather than revelation or Kaballah ) .

As this vibration travels into the universe it slows down its vibration and becomes matter. As Malcomn Godwin explains in Angels: A n Endangered Species, it is generally thought there are nine celestial orders orbiting the Throne of Glory. These orders are grouped in three ranks with the highest order being the closest to God. The first order of celestial beings includes the Seraphim, Cherubim and Thrones. These angels are in direct contact with the God Source and receive God’s unfiltered Light. In the middle are the Dominations, Virtues and Powers. These middle ranking angels act as transmitters of the Light to the lower order, who then transmit to humanity. The lowest order, those closest to humans, are the Principalities, Archangels and Angels. The Seraphs are considered to be the highest order of angels.

Wikipedia and the Catholic Encyclopedia list Rome, Maryland as Washington D.C.’s original name. Like Rome, Washington D.C. has seven hills whose names are Capitol Hill, Meridian Hill, Floral Hills, Forest Hill, Hillbrook, Hillcrest, and Knox Hill. The tract of land, which rose 88 feet above the Potomac River ( the highest point in the district ) had for many years belonged to the Carroll family and was noted in their records of ownership as \"New Troy” after the legendary mighty city in Homer’s poems ( and which many take as an allegory for Atlantis ) . It was Je ff erson who had come up with the name Capitol Hill, consciously invoking the great temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill in ancient Rome. It was sacred to Jupiter or Jove, the king of the gods, along with his companion deities Juno and Minerva ( who is prominently featured in Je ff erson’s Library ) . Jupiter ( Zeus in Greece ) was worshipped at Capitoline Hill in the form of a stone, known as Iuppiter Lapis or the Jupiter Stone, which was sworn upon as an oath stone. As we have seen, Greenough’s statue of Washington as Zeus - Jupiter was intended to sit in the Rotunda of the Capitol. Troy was also called I ! i or I ! iu m . I ! i means light. The Illi were the People of ( or who worshipped ) Light. The Hebrews called the Illi Els ( ‘shining ones’ ) . Their story is too long to be told here. All we need to know for now is that the word capitol originally means ‘the head Illi’ from the chief hi ! in Rome, Capitoline Hill, which was originally possessed by the Illi. Hill is tel ( t - el ) in Hebrew and in Greek it is poli . Hence, politics is done on top of Capitol Hill, a ff ectionately and appropriately called ‘the Hill’. Construction on the Temple of Liberty ( “on the hill” ) began in 1793, following the open design contest for the Congress House and the President’s House suggested by Secretary of State Thomas Je ff erson. None of the seventeen contestants designs were deemed worthy to become the people’s temple of the newly formed American nation, and to serve as an architectural metaphor for their Enlightened hopes and aspirations. Then, one final design, submitted by a physician and amateur architect named Dr. William Thornton, a wealthy plantation owner living on the Caribbean island of Tortola, was flashed before George Washington and Je ff erson. The Masonic Grand Master and the enlightened statesman immediately took a shine to the proposed neo - classical dome flanked by its two wings ( inspired by the east front of the Louvre and the Pantheon ) .

Instead, Latrobe elaborated on Thornton’s design. By the early 1810s the Capitol’s wings were nearing completion, but the dome was not even begun. War was brewing with Great Britain and cash flow had to be channeled toward the war e ff ort. Construction would come to a dead halt when the British invaded Washington and set fire to the Capitol on August 24, 1814. A providential rainstorm saved the temple from burning to the ground. After the defeat of the British reconstruction of the wings of the Capitol commenced in 1815 under the direction of a new architect, Charles Bulfinch. It was completed in 1819. For the next seven years work continued on the center Rotunda area and the first dome of the Capitol. The new Architect of the Capitol envisioned a more robust dome. Thinking he could outsmart the new President, James Monroe, Bulfinch submitted two plans for approval. One was his pet favorite. The other featured a massive wooden dome sheathed in copper. Bulfinch hoped the uglier copper dome would prompt Monroe to choose his pet favorite. He was wrong. Monroe chose the copper monstrosity.

The vast majority of Northern religious bodies ardently supported the war for the Union. Of these groups, Protestants still enjoyed a significant numerical and cultural dominance in the 1860s. Catholics and Jews provided notable support for the war; but Protestants, given their numbers and position in American life, contributed religious or theological justifications of the war that had wider social and political impact. They believed America held a special place in the World history. A Northern victory would clear the way for the establishment of the Millennial Kingdom of God, the thousand years of peace that prepares the way for the Second Coming of Christ, as prophesied in chapter twenty of the Book of Revelation. Moorhead cites one Baptist minister, preaching in Philadelphia in 1863, who claimed that the defeat of the rebellion would bring a time that the Founding Fathers of the republic \"pictured and dreamed about, and prayed for. It will come with blessings, and be greeted with Hallelujahs, it will be the Millennium of political glory, the Sabbath of Liberty, the Jubilee of humanity.\" This shifted the Northern view of the Civil War from a battle to preserve the Union to an all-out spiritual battle for Liberation. The Capitol Dome came to symbolize this mind-set. This belief, says Moorhead, is also reflected in the way the Churches handled the issue of slavery. Some churches pointed out that Jesus lived in a time when slavery was accepted and he didn’t say a single word about it. The apostle Paul directly stated that slaves be obedient to their masters. As the Civil War progressed, and Union forces suffered military losses, Northerners began to view the losses as punishment by God. Church leaders sought new ways to rally the masses. Slavery was that issue. Ministers began preaching that the only way America could win the War was to first eradicate slavery. In 1861 the President declared that his sole purpose was to preserve the Union. By the fall of 1862, Lincoln announced his intention to free slaves in those areas still in rebellion against the government. President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, as the nation approached its third year of bloody civil war.

After Secretary of War Je ff erson Davis, a slave owner from Mississipi, objected to the sculptor's intention to include a liberty cap, the Roman symbol of freed slaves, Crawford replaced it with a crested Roman helmet and, at Davis’s suggestion, a crown of stars “expressive of endless existence, and of heavenly birth”.

The earliest domes were probably modeled after beehives. The bee is symbolic of the Empress and the feminine powers of Nature because they are ruled by queens. Some focus on the bee as a symbol for obedience, industry and cooperation. The bee is also a symbol for wisdom as it collects pollen from flowers and turns it into honey, which is the gold of the bees. This gold is an o ff ering to the Deity. Likewise, the seeker collects wisdom from varied sources, especially personal experiences, and turns it into spiritual gold, which is then o ff ered to the Deity. At another octave, the bee symbolizes death and rebirth ( regeneration ) and the soul. Because the bee appears to die in the winter and return in the spring - they actually hibernate in the hive - it also became the symbol of death and rebirth. In ancient Egypt, honey was placed in tombs as sacred o ff erings to the dead. The honey is the food of the immaterial Field of the Blessed ( or the Promised Land ) , where the raised or perfected humans dwell for eternity. A controversy exists over whether or not Jesus ate honeycomb after his Perfection and Resurrection. Early versions of Luke 24:42 reads, “And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.” The final phrase, “and of an honeycomb”, is missing in most modern versions. “The first philosopher,” Pythagoras ( c. 580 B.C. ) , was one who understood nature’s sacred geometry and the meaning of the bee and the honeycomb. Pythagoreans made ( identified ) the hexago n as an expression of the spirit of Aphrodite ( also called Melissa the ‘Queen Bee’ ) and worshipped bees as her sacred creatures who understood how to create perfect hexagons in their honeycomb. What is more, and here is the key point, the lattice or matrix of the honeycomb was seen as a symbol of the underlying matrix of energy or vibrating unified field that creates our reality."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"\r 114 \" P u r i t y \" a n d \" s a l v a t i o n \" ( w h i c h a r e equated with perfection) are symbolized by honey.

Author C.W. Leadbeater writes in his The Hidden Life i n Freemasonry , that beehive - shaped structures ( i.e. the Capitol Dome ) can serve as subtle structures. In certain rites the candidate is placed within these subtle structures so that he may absorb the subtle energetic influences of the spot conjured by the rites into his or her body and spirit. ‘ S o l o m o n ’ s B u i l d e r s ’ , t h e Fr e e m a s o n s , incorporated this symbolism in the design for Washington, D.C. Viewed through the lens of Freemasonry the Capitol Dome is a fantastic ‘beehive’. It is a collector or portal of solar energy. Scientists have long known that the Earth and Sun are connected. Earth’s magnetosphere ( the protective bubble that surrounds our planet ) is filled with high - energy particles from the Sun. Some penetrate this bubble. Recent NASA experiments reveal that such “flux transfer events” ( NASA’s term ) do exist and may be more common that previously supposed. Like bees to a hive these particles can be attracted by domed temples and infuse them with solar energy. This is why some domes are painted gold. THE DOME IS THE HEAD Dome is slang for the human head. So, by extension, when one enters the inner space of a dome, whether in a mosque or the Capitol t e m p l e / b u i l d i n g , o n e symbolically enters the inner space of the head. The Papal Tiara, a prominent symbol of the papacy, is a classic example of the human - head - is - a - dome/beehive imagery. Like the example here, from the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., these crowns have the shape of a circular beehive. This is because the head is a dome or ‘beehive’.

The Latin crypta means “hidden” or “secret.” A crypt is usually found in cemeteries and under public religious buildings, such as churches and cathedrals. It’s a burial place, but also, importantly, a meeting place. The star in the crypt ( next page ) marks the literal ground zero in Washington.

De Lubicz’s work centered on the Temple of Luxor, located 2 miles from Thebes, Egypt’s Vatican. The plan for this temple, he demonstrated, is based on human proportions and designed to symbolically represent the human body (l). It is an open book containing the secrets of human spiritual anatomy. In this temple he found a human being embodied in the geometry of the Temple’s architecture. This, he concluded is Pharaoh, symbolic of the Perfect Man. De Lubicz’s drawing superimposes neatly over LaTrobe’s plan for the Capitol. It is ironic that that U.S. Capitol mimics the sacred layout of Luxor temple considering that America was founded to abolish the Divine Right of Kings. It was built as a setting for the rituals of the Festival of Opet. The word ‘Opet’ means ‘Secret Chamber’. So it is “the Festival of the Secret Chamber.” During this festival the king would make a ceremonial precession from Karnak along the avenue of Sphinxs to the temple of Luxor, located 2 miles away. The king would make his way to one of the innermost chambers of the temple. There, the king and his divine essence (called the ka , and created at his birth), were united and the king transformed into a divine being. The crowd, waiting anxiously, their belly’s full of bread and beer provided by the king for the rite, would cheer wildly upon the king’s emergence as the transformed or transfigured god-man.

ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLISM IN THE APOTHEOSIS An Icon of Transformation The metaphysical idea expressed in the Apotheosis that humans can perfect themselves or transform into god - men is described in many spiritual traditions. How to accomplish this transformation is the deepest secret of the Ages. Alchemists believe that anyone can do this. Alchemy is the art of transformation from an impure to a pure state. They call it the Great Work. It is also known as the “Perennial Philosophy.” It is called the Wise Ar t of the Egyptians and is attributed to a group of divine beings who are said to have visited Egypt during a period known as Zep Tepi or the First Time. Called the Shemsu Hor , their name means ‘Wise Ones’ or ‘Transfigured Ones’. Alchemists believe that if they can find the Philosopher’s Stone they can transmute or perfec t any element, including the human body. Said to be a common substance, part earthly, part heavenly, the Philosopher’s Stone is found everywhere but unrecognized and unappreciated. It is referred to as the Elixir of Life. Freemasons like Sir Isaac Newton and Nicholas Flammel believed the manifestation of the Philosopher’s Stone would bring enlightenment upon the maker and conclude the Great Work. When Jesus Transfigured or Metamorphosed ( Greek, meaning “a change in form” ) into light atop the ‘high mount’ it is thought that he demonstrated his mastery of this Wise Art."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"\r 170 In this detail from a Hesychast robe, Jesus sits on a rainbow in a Sun gate surrounded by angels. Hesychasm (from Greek word \"hesychia\" – silence, peace, quietness) was a 4th century Egyptian teaching and practice aimed at the acquisition of the Holy Spirit and deification (apotheosis) of the human soul and body. The ultimate goal of hesychasm is human transfiguration and theosis after the likeness of the risen Christ. The hesychasts held that through prayer and meditation believers could actually come to perceive the same divine light that shone around the Transfigured Jesus. The goal of Hesychastics was to experience the Holy Light of Transfiguration through meditation. The alchemist’s quest for the Philosopher’s Stone begins with the realization that everything is alive; everything is energy in motion. Everything is imagination. Everything is connected -- stars, plants, planets, symbols, numbers -- in the integrated imagination of the alchemist. Everything can be transformed or transmuted. Thoughts can become things. Lead can become gold. A human can become a star. This alchemical mind - set was adopted by the icon makers of the 14 - 17th century. An icon is a sacred image that is believed to be charged with spiritual power. Viewing an icon is considered a spiritual activity as it is imagined as a ‘doorway’ or a ‘portal’, a point of contact between the viewer and subject. They make the subject present to us, transferring their power to us. Often, the subject is portrayed in action. For example, Christ makes gestures of blessing or o ff ers books of knowledge. Believers do not w orship the icon, rather, through the icon they make contact with a divine being, such as Christ in his exalted state. By meditating on imagery such as the Transfiguration ( next page ) to the point of saturation, spiritual energy is transmitted through the icon and adepts can internalize Jesus’ experience in their own bodies. A chemical reaction occurs as the believer alchemizes the energy transmitted through the icon. Reproduce the proper alchemical manipulations, and theoretically, one could literally transfigure.

What makes it an ‘alchemical icon’ ( our term ) is its spiritual iconography. The imagery surrounding the deified Washington is meant to show that he is living in the ( rainbow ) Light of God. He has journeyed from the outer world to the inner, from the earthly to the heavenly. This icon shows us how to do it, too. The Philosopher’s Stone was produced by harmonizing the four elements of earth, air, fire and water with a fifth essence, the divine life - essence in everything. As we will show momentarily, Brumidi encoded explicit pagan symbols of all five of these elements of alchemy in the Apthotheosis . This is not by chance. He knew exactly what he was doing. For the past 144 years Brumidi’s secret has remained hidden in plain sight. We are the first to make this connection. We further propose the circular Apotheosis should be viewed as a mandala . Strictly translated, the word mandala means a ‘magic circle’. It is thought of as a sacred diagram used for centering that reminds us of our connection to the universe and our ability to achieve divine powers, as well as a visual aid to spiritual instruction and enlightenment. The purpose of the Apotheosis goes beyond glorifying George Washington. Its purpose is to open a gate into the heavenly realms for the viewer. This mandala is something to be repeatedly contemplated. We believe that when visitors to the Capitol look up into the Eye of the Dome and encounter the Apotheosis they can engage in profound spiritual instruction. The Eye of the Dome is the open eye to spiritual truth and to the universe. Indeed, it is a ‘stargate’. Once this imagery and alchemical symbolism is revealed the Apotheosis can be seen as an instruction manual for the liberation of the human soul through the alchemical process.

In alchemical symbolism Vulcan is a symbol of the smith who crafts his golden body or light body from the furnace of the body. During the Renaissance the physician, Paracelsus, led a campaign to promote Vulcan as the god of alchemy. Paracelsus made a good case for Vulcan in his writing - \"Alchemy is an art and Vulcan ( the governor of fire ) is the artist in it: He who is Vulcan has the power of the art'...All things have been created in an unfinished state, nothing is finished, but Vulcan must bring all things to their completion.

Some think Ophiuchus represents the Trojan priest Laocoön. Most, however, believe the figure represents the healer Asclepius, who learned the secrets of raising the dead and immortality after observing one serpent bringing another healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius' influence, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning, but later placed his image in the heavens to honor his good works. Significantly, Ophiuchus is the only constellation in human form that resides in the direction of the center of our Milky Way. Symbolists interpret the lifting of the serpent to mean that Ophiuchus represents transcendence. His story conveys the notion of resurrection. Interestingly, the Hebrew term “nachash” can mean serpent, but it can also mean “bright”, as in “shining.” In numerous traditions holy ones are described as shining or illuminated. The ‘serpent’ or ‘mor tality cure’ that is lifted by Ophiuchus may be equated with kundalini . The Rod of Ascleipus, the single serpent rising on a rod, represents this power and the constellation Ophiuchus. This is the rod of Moses. In Acts 28:3 the apostle Paul is connected with Ophiuchus: “And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.” The serpent and the bundle of sticks accompany Liberty in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall. This could be interpreted to mean that she is standing between Ophiuchus and Aquila, the eagle. Or, if the viper that emerged from the Paul’s fire is interpreted as kundalini, then it is possible to interpret Liberty as the goddess of kundalini. It is important to note that Liberty stares at the statue of Clio traversing time upon her winged chariot ( Merkaba ) . Recall, George Washington’s face is sculpted on this chariot. Added together, it suggests that when we lift the serpent ( kundalini ) we transfigure into a shining one. We achieve cosmic Freedom. This is the ‘lost/forbidden secret’ of all the sacred traditions.

This is the number of years it takes to the Earth to c o m p l e t e o n e precessional movement through the Zodiac. 72 is a powerful esoteric number with numerous correspondences in the Mysteries. 72 is the number of Mighty Kings and demons Solomon commanded into a vessel of brass.

The 72 Buddhas seated within each of the stupas on the circular terrace of the main dome at the 9 th century Meru temple of Borobudur in Java, Indonesia is a prime example of the same idea. These Stupas are arranged on the Meru pyramid (itself acting as chronomonitor of the 27 lunar mansions through which the Moon passes in one lunar year), in such a manner as to mark the 1° of precession shift of our planet within the 12 zodiac houses — 72 years per degree, 360 x 72 for the complete zodiac wheel (never mind the axiomatic 27/72).

Blake tells how the thirteen angels of the Masonic Council of Truth appear to Washington as a succession of bright flaming stars in the East. Then there is another Eastern way of looking at these 13 star beings. There is a tantra of Tibetan Great Perfection, for example, that says that the Great Perfection teaching did not originate on Earth.

On the top right and the next page, we present the Apotheosisis with Metatron’s Cube with 13 circles superimposed. Staring into it is thought to provoke a shift in consciousness. Thirteen circles form Metatron’s Cube. It is a hexagram inside a hexagon, or a cube with in cube. The diagram, created by connecting the centers of all the circles in the form (two rings of 6, and one in the center) is said to function as a blueprint for the crystal structures of all carbon based life. In it we see the cube of space. The hexagram (six-pointed star, Star of David) is the symbol of the universe or Macrocosm. When the points of the hexagram are connected, we have a hexagon, and when the center point of the hexagram is connected we have the Cube. The symbol of the Macrocosm is formed by six circles of equal diameter centered around a central seventh circle of the same diameter. (The circle is a symbol of the female. The straight lines symbolize the male.) According to Dr. Case, the hexagram “is the key to all geometrical forms.” If the six circles tangent to a central seventh were projected into three dimensions, it would be twelve spheres tangent to a central thirteenth. This is called Metatron’s Cube or the Fruit of Life. When you look at this image, the eye is first presented with hexagons and hexagrams; then with triangles and rectangles. Metatron’s cube was discovered by the brilliant 13th century Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano, better known as Fibonacci. It represents magic, alchemy and ascension as it contains 2 - dimensional images of the five Perfect or Platonic Solids. The five shapes are named after Plato ( c. 400 B.C. ) , who in Timaeus states that each of the Perfect Solids is related to one of the fundamental elements of earth ( cube ) , air ( octahedron ) , fire ( tetrahedron ) and water ( icosahedron ) with the fifth being the life force or kundalini , symbolized by the dodecahedron. Sacred geometers believe the Philosopher’s Stone is found within these 5 shapes. Fibonacci primarily worked for the royal families of Italy. He’s famed for replacing the Roman numeral system with the decimal system and for discovering a series of numbers when he studied the Great Pyramid at Giza. The series, known as the Fibonacci series, is the sum of the two previous numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3. 5., 5, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 into infinity. Dividing one number by the next after the eighth sequence yields 21/34 = .618. This is the relationship of the height of the Great Pyramid to 1/2 its base. This ratio is known as the Golden Ratio. This ratio is found throughout architecture, art and music. It appears in Athena’s Parthenon and in the works of such diverse artists as Rembrandt, Michaelangelo, Da Vinci, and Raphael.

According to one school of thought, he is Enoch, a man who lived before the Great Flood and who was taken to Heaven by God as a sole pure example of the pre - flood civilization ( that was ultimately destroyed ) and transformed into Metatron, explaining the mysterious passage \"Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him away ( Genesis 5:24 NIV ) . The name Metatron is thought to be Greek meaning meta - thronos , “beyond the throne” or Latin metator , “guide.” The ancient Greeks declare that Enoch is the same as Mercury, Hermes and Thoth. In the mystery tradition of Judaism recorded in Kabbalistic legends, Enoch is said to ha ve transformed from human into the Archangel Metatron after ascending to the Throne of God ( where Washington sits ) and having an ointment ( elixir ) rubbed over his body. In the Chronicles of Enoch, there is a passage about when Enoch first v i s i t e d h e a v e n , b e f o r e h i s d e a t h a n d transformation. \"Then the Lord said to Michael: 'Go and strip Enoch of his own clothes; anoin t him with oil , and dress him like ourselves' and Michael did as he was told. He stripped me of my clothes, and rubbed me over with a wonderful oil like dew; with the scent of myrrh; which shone like a sunbeam. And I looked at myself, and I was like one of the other angels; there was no di ff erence and all my fear and trembling left me.\" This oil is the Elixir of Life that transforms Enoch into a radiant angel. It is the Philosopher’s Stone. Sitting next to God, Enoch was instructed in wisdom. He is unique in that he alone among the angels sits upon a throne, as does God, and he sees the Face of God. Using his skills as a scribe, he wrote three hundred and sixty - six books. At the end of these discussions, Enoch returned to Earth for a short time, to instruct everyone, including his sons, in all he learned. After thirty days, the angels returned him to Heaven. And then the divine transformation took place. This is a classic example of the ‘ascension of the prophet and the heavenly book’ motif. William Blake’s The Whirlwind: Ezekiel’s Vision of the Cherubim and Eyed Wheels , of the Chariot-Throne of God. Is this Metatron? In the Zohar, Metatron is a manifestation of Shekhinah (I:179b), the first “offspring” of the supernal union of God’s feminine and masculine aspects (I: 143a, 162a-b. Also see Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah , p. 187)."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"\r 205 In 3 Enoch Metatron - Enoch describes to Rabbi Ishmael how he lived before the Great Flood ( the Atlantean civilization, some say ) and was transubstantiated from mortal to angelic form. Ishmael tells us how he had ascended on high through seven halls or heavens, one within the other, to see a vision of the Merkaba ( Divine Chariot or Throne of Glory ) . Enoch was lifted to heaven in one of these fiery chariots with fiery horses. Under the direction of Michael and Gabriel Enoch grew in size until his body filled the whole universe ( signaling a reversal of the “fall” of Adam ) . He sprouted 72 wings ( for each of the 72 names of God ) , 36 on each side, and grew 365,000 luminous eyes ( indicating he had became omniscient, symbolized by acquiring 1000 eyes for each day of the year ) . God made for him a garment of glory and clad him in it. In early traditions, this garment was considered a ‘light substance’ in which the inhabitants of the high heavens appear. It is a necessary condition for entering the high heavens ( or the primordial states of E Pluribus Unum? ) . God then wrote the mystical secrets of creation on Enoch’s crown. Immense energy, beautiful sparks and fire emanated from him, says 3 Enoch. His material body turned into celestial fire -- flesh, veins, bones, all metamorphosed to glorious flame. ( Some compare him to Elijah who ascended in a whirlwind that encircled his body ) . According to the Zohar, Enoch radiates the divine Shekinah, the divine rainbow . Finally, he is given a crown resembling the crown worn by God. A heavenly herald proclaims that from then on his name would no longer be Enoch, but Metatron. It is apparent to us that 3 Enoch is a description of Enoch awakening kundalini, attaining the Great Perfection, the Rainbow Body and becoming the meta - human, Metatron."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"\r 206 As Metatron, Enoch’s flesh becomes light and he takes on a new density in the heavenly realm. Brumidi is suggesting the same thing for Washington. The early Christian author, Origen, speculated that angels had a kind of material existence, but one that was “less dense” or closer to the original material prima from which they and the rest of creation were created. Since quantum physics tells us that our own seemingly solid reality is actually energetic or “idea - like,” it should come as no surprise that the higher dimensions must also be experienced by their inhabitants as “physical.” That means that what we regard as “thought” is perceived as “matter” in the higher dimensions. Metatron is called \"the Youth\" in 3 Enoch, where it appears to mean \"ser vant\". As Enoch, he is identified as an ‘elder’ on Earth. The discrepancy in these terms suggests a ‘graduation’ along with an ascension. Enoch, the elder, was ‘high’ ( spiritually advanced, pure ) in the earthly world. He became ‘low’ in the higher heavenly realm, where he is perceived as a “youth” or a “beginner”. He is assigned junior - level ( from the heavenly perspective ) tasks like attending the Throne ( if such a task could be considered ‘low’ ) . In Merkabah literature, he appears as a guide to human adepts visiting heaven. ( Another fairly common task. ) Later in the stor y, Metatron earns his own throne. He is described as the High Priest in the heavenly Temple and is called the Minister of the Throne of Glory. Enoch - Metatron is best known as a divine intermediator and a bridge. In the Talmud and Targum ( the Babylonian version of the Talmud ) , Metatron is the direct link between God and humanity. The Zohar ( Book of Slendor , an important book of Jewish mysticism ) identifies Metatron as the angel that led the people of Israel through the ‘wilderness’ after their Exodus from Egypt ( again referring to Exodus 23:21 ) to the land of milk and honey, and describes him as a heavenly priest. As noted, during the Exodus Moses parted the Red Sea with a rod. The Zohar associates this rod with the rod of Metatron, the caduceus. Again, the caduceus is the primary symbol of America and is a symbol of transformation and, perhaps, inter - dimensional travel. The land of milk and honey, the Promised Land of Canaan, to which Metatron leads the Israelites is equated with the Egyptian Aaru or Field of the Blessed. The Egyptians make clear this is an otherworldly realm, and one parallel to our own. It is the infinite realm of the Blessed Immortals. From this perspective, when Metatron guides humanity to the land of milk and honey he is leading a spiritual journey or initiation ‘out of the box’ of this realm to another dimension; one where individuals transform into light beings.

This would explain why the Metatron’s Cube geometry fits so eloquently on the Apotheosis of George Washington, who it now appears, has become not just meta - human, but Metatron. We find support for this in Freemasonic literature. In Scottish Rite Masonry, the thirteenth degree is called the Royal Arch of Solomon. It precedes the degree of Perfection. It tells how Enoch hid his cube in Solomon’s Temple. Since the Capitol Dome is seen by Freemasons as a recreation of Solomon’s Temple it is vital for us to consider this rite. As the story goes, Enoch, after having been told of the impending Flood, excavated nine chambers or apartments in the Earth, each featuring an arch. ( Arch could easily mean arc, ark, circle or bow, i.e. rainbow. ) In the ninth or lowest chamber Enoch hid a white cub e with an inset golden triangle on which was inscribed the True Name of God. There are di ff erent versions of the story, but the essence is that workmen preparing the site for the Temple ( either Solomon's I or II ) , discovered the opening, climbed down to the ninth level and recovered the cube. One school of thought has it that Enoch’s lost cube is Metatron’s Cube. We agree. We find it more than interesting that it can be discovered in the dome of the U.S. Capitol, the recreated Solomon’s Temple. This school of thought further has it that, in addition to being a domed building, Solomon’s Temple is also a template for the human brain. When the 9 original French Knights Templar excavated ‘beneath’ Solomon’s Temple ( c. 1100 AD ) , so this interpretation holds, they were actually probing the human unconscious in search of the “treasure” of the Temple ( the expanded consciousness of the human mind ) . With this discovery they returned to France and immediately set about building ethereal cathedrals as “vessels of divine light” and places of alchemical union with this light. We believe the Philosopher’s Stone is the Stone of Jacob and the twelve tribes of Israel. It is the Holy Grail shared by Jesus at the Last Supper with the 12 apostles. It is the 12 circles that orbit Metatron in the book of Enoch, when God gave Enoch a job and changed his name to Metatron. It is the 12 circles of Metatron’s Cube that tangent the 13th. The repetition of the number 12 is intentional. In addition to the twelve signs of the zodiac, it references the twelve cranial nerves; the Olfactory, Optic, Motor Oculi, Trochlear, Trifacial, Abducent, Facial, Auditory, Glosso pharyngeal, Pnumogastric or Vagus, Spinal accessory, and Hypoglossal. The evidence for Solomon’s Temple having a neural corollary is given when Enoch arrives in the realm of the blessed in 3 Enoch. A group of high angels greet him and say, “What smell of one born of woman and what taste of a white drop ( is this ) that ascends on high.” This white drop has been interpreted as semen. However, given that kundalini/the Philosopher’s Stone is also imagined as a white substance and that this is an ascension story, we think it should be given equal consideration. In our opinion, the ‘milk and honey’ of the Promised Land are esoteric brain secretions ( oils ) and other ointments found in the spinal cord, in the nerves of the body that alter our consciousness and enable us to see the dimension of the Blessed and transmute the human body into the Rainbow Body. These oils raise from the tomb of the solar plexus, through the Rotunda or heart center, to the cerebrum ( head or dome ) .

One answer we propose is to embrace the Aphotheosis as an alchemical icon. Imagine it as a ‘doorway’ or a ‘portal’. Saturate your body with the heavenly energy it potentially transmits. For another answer we turn to Joseph Chilton Pearce, author of The Biology of Transcendenc e . Pearce wondered why we as humans seem stuck in a culture of violence and injustice. How is it, he wondered, that we can recognize the transcendent ideal represented by figures such as we have seen in this book -- Jesus, Enoch, Washington -- and yet cannot seem to reach the same state. Pearce looked at current biological understanding of our brain organization to address how we can transcend our evolutionary capacities and limitations. This latest research identifies four neural centers of our brain, plus a fifth, in our heart. To us, these five centers appear to be another reflection of the 5 elements of alchemy. The bottom line of this research says that the heart has its own intelligence and it is love. When we shift our attention to our heart. and create and hold for a few moments in our imaginations a loving event, this creates a bridge between the heart and higher brain structures. The first step to activate is to learn to forgive and this requires being willing to see God in everything . This is the alchemical mindset required to transfigure. It will make all things new. It is perhaps best expressed by the alchemist, Paracelsus, who wrote: “Man is not a body. The heart, the spirit, is man. And spirit is an entire star, out which he is built. If there fore a man is perfect in his hear t , nothing in the whole light of nature is hidden from him. This returns us to Egypt where the heart was the primary center of dimension - shifting transformation and cosmic freedom. It was against the feather of Maat, the Egyptian goddess of cosmic order and truth, that the heart is weighed in the Book of Coming Forth By Day, and if the scales balance then the deceased may enter the “Field of the Blessed” and enjoy the afterlife. May we suggest that the next time you’re in the Rotunda that you’ll take a moment to stand on the gold dot in the center of the Dome. Shift your attention to the area of your heart.

Brumidi was 72 and white - haired when he began painting the frieze. His death occurred at 6:30 a.m. on February 19, 1880, at his home at 921 G Street, N.W., a three - story brick house owned by his former wife, now Lola V.

George Washington praying in the Congressional Prayer Room Near the Rotunda of the Capitol there is a room set apart for prayer. It is not a room for religious assemblies, nor for any other public use. Its only purpose is to provide a quiet place to which individual Senators and Representatives may withdraw a while to seek Divine strength and guidance, both in public a ff airs and in their own personal concerns. It was opened in 1955. The public is not allowed in this room. Nor is photography. A pamphlet made available by the o ffi ce of the Architect of the Capitol provides the details of the room. The single window speaks of that religious faith which has always been a part of the greatness of our Nation. The central figure is of the kneeling Washington, reminding us of the words from his First Inaugural: \" . . . it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first o ffi cial act, my fervent supplications to tha t Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who p r e s i d e s i n t h e c o u n c i l s o f n a t i o n s, a n d w h o s e providential aids can supply every human defect, tha t His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States, a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success th e functions a & otted to his charg e .\" In the medallion, immediately surrounding the central figure, woven into the ruby glass, is the text from Psalm 16:1, \"Preserve me, 0 God: for in Thee do I put my trust.\" Above and below are the two sides of the Great Seal of the United States.

The Sacred Number 72 The ring or ʻ stargate ʼ of 72 stars around the Apotheosis of George Washington . 72 stars x 5 points in each star = 360 points. 72 x 360 = 25, 920, the number of years it takes to complete one precessional movement through the Zodiac. Like a wobbling top, the Earth gyrates in a circle once every 25,920 years. This is called precessional movement. As the Earth slowly wobbles, it changes the position of the stars in the sky very slowly over long periods of time. This is extremely important if you are an astronomer or astrologer. The code number to remember in precession is 72. The reason 72 is so important is because in 72 years the stars in the heavens will shift one degree. 72 years equals one degree of change. When Muslims die,they receive 72 Virgins in Paradise. Jesus was in the tomb three days = 72 hours. Metatron led 72 princes and had 72 eyes in his wings.

The Sacred Meaning of the Numbers in the Dome Many sacred numbers are represented in the architectural features of the Dome’s elaborate detailing.

The Sacred Number 260 and the Capitol 13 x 20 = 260 These are the numbers of the Aztec/Mayan Tzolkin Calendar painted by Brumidi in the frieze of the Rotunda. The Tzolkin describes the energies of creation moving t h r o u g h c y c l e s w i t h i n cycles, based on a 13:20 ratio. One round is 13 tones and the other round is 20 glyphs or days. As the wheels turn, the 13 tones and 20 glyphs match up p r o d u c i n g a u n i q u e energetic signature for each day, for 260 days. 13 X 20 = 260 days 13 tones on the inner dome, 20 glyphs on the outer dome create a wheel of time 260 days long. 260 days is the amount of time it takes for gestation of a human being. The Aztecs had discovered a time cycle for our evolutionary processes. They had 13 months which were 20 days long each on their calendar. They had 20 weeks each 13 days in length.

At the dedication of the new United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. on September 18, 1793. President George Washington stands in front of a crowd dressed in his Masonic apron as he taps a gavel on the Masonic cornerstone of the Capitol. He then covers the cornerstone with corn, oil, and wine, Masonic symbols of consecration, and dedicates the building \"in the thirteenth year of American independence . . . and in the year of Masonry, 5793\" ( Bullock 1996, 137 ) . America's first President is acting like an ancient priest as he consecrates the country in the name of Freemasonry. The use of corn, the symbol of nourishment, oil, the symbol of peace and light, and wine, the symbol of joy, consecrates the building as a “lodge” intended to serve mankind.

War and Peace: Jachin and Boaz The main entrance to the Capitol is through the Columbus Doors, also called the Rogers Doors or Rotunda Doors. They’re 17 feet high and weigh 20,000 pounds. Above the semicircular tympanum is a bust of Columbus, surrounded by rays and oak leaves. The Architect of the Capitol says this signifies his rising to glory ( light body? ) Flanking the Rotunda Doors are marbles statues of War and Peace executed by Luigi Persico in Italy. They arrived at the Capitol in 1834 and were placed in niches on the east front portico, flanking the doors to the Capitol Rotunda. The Rotunda is the holy of holies of the Capitol Temple, which we have proposed, is Solomon’s Temple. We think it highly likely that, to the Masons who constructed the Capitol, War and Peace would not only signify the archetypal energies of male and female, but also, and more importantly, they would have seen them as personifications of Jachin and Boaz, the twin pillars that flanked the entrance to Solomon’s Temple."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"\r 225 Bibliography Allen, William C., The Dome of the United States Capitol: An Architectural History , Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing O ffi ce , 1992.
