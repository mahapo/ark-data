At the end of the Great Depression America was a wasteland. Hopeless millions were out of work. The hand of nature had blackened the heartland and the Corn Belt with dust. Everywhere there was hunger. Americans thought the world was coming to an end. They litera lly scratched to live. At the same time they begged for another chance.

In the 1920’s Roerich had traveled the Far East thr ough Cashmere, Tibet, China and Mongolia gaining renown as a mystic and a painter.

One of these followers was Henry A. Wallace, F.D.R. ’s Secretary of Agriculture. Roosevelt himself first met Roerich while governor of New York between 1928 and 1932. As President, F.D.R . and his Secretary of Agriculture were thoroughly be guiled by Roerich’s extravagant tales of healing herbs and drought-resistant grasses in mystic Mongolia. The charismatic painter had passionately convinced the President and the Secretary of Agriculture to back a scientific expedition to Mongolia to return some of these grasses to heal America’s heartland. It was common knowledge around the halls of the Roosevelt Administration, however, that F.D.R., Wal lace and Roerich had more than grasses on their minds. Roerich had also persuaded Wallace and F.D.R. that Christ was alive and living in Shambhala, the Buddh ist paradise atop Mount Meru in Mongolia.

AND THE SECRET OF THE TEMPLARS Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, on his father’s estate, Springwood, in Hyde P ark, New York. He was the only child of James and Sara Roosevelt. James Roosevelt was a wealthy vice presi dent of the Delaware and Hudson Railway. His wife was a member of the wealthy Delano family. Franklin’s parents brought him up to be a leader. J ames Roosevelt made sure his son had all the advantages that wealth could buy including private tutors and exten sive European travels. From the time he was three years old F.D.R.’s famil y spent their summers on Campobello, an island off th e coast of Maine. When he was 16, Franklin was given a 21-f oot sailboat by his father. Franklin named the ship the N e w Moon and began to sail the mysterious waters near Compobello. It was about this time that F.D.R.’s lifelong inter est in treasure hunting ignited. Among Franklin’s earliest voyages was a four-day search of Grand Manan Island in the nearby Bay of Fundy for the lost treasure of Ca ptain Kidd. He continued his quest for gold from that mom ent on."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 7 Compobello Island is located beside the largest whirlpool in the Western Hemisphere. In young Frank lin’s time the air of Compobello was thick with the legen ds of nearby Oak Island from the locals who wielded impre ssive stories about Captain William Kidd, pirates, and th e lost treasure of the Knights Templar, possibly even bill ions of dollars in Templar gold. These stories stuck with F ranklin into his adult years. In his twenties he would acti vely search for the Oak Island treasure. In the meantime Roosevelt enrolled at Harvard University. He majored in history and earned fair g rades. He joined intramural rowing and football teams. He also was elected secretary of the Freshman Glee Club. Roosevelt graduated from Harvard in 1903. In 1904, he entered the Columbia University Law School. On March 17, 1905 he married his distant co usin, Eleanor Roosevelt. President Theodore Roosevelt, Eleanor’s uncle, gave the bride away. Eleanor and F ranklin had known each other slightly since childhood. F.D. R. fell in love with her while at Harvard. F.D.R. passed the bar examination in 1907. But he h ad little interest in the study of law and left school that year before receiving a degree. Roosevelt worked as a cl erk for a law firm in New York City for the next three year s. However, he showed little enthusiasm for legal work. Always on his mind during these years was the myste ry of Oak Island. In 1909, as a 27-year old lawyer wit h the New York law firm of Carter, Ledyard, and Milburn, F.D.R. bought shares in a treasure search group tha t sought to recover the treasure of Oak Island. 1 He visited Oak Island"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 8 that summer and even participated in the search and recovery work. Oak Island was most certainly the mother lode of al l treasure spots in North America. Originally, it was called Smith Island. In 1795 a sixteen-year-old boy discov ered a saucer-shaped depression blanketed with red clover in which stood a lone towering oak. F.D.R. as a young man"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 9 Judging by the numerous rotting stumps of former gr eat oaks and the fact that the lone oak had a limb sawe d-off four feet from the trunk, the boy suspected somethi ng fishy was going on here. Locals believed the island was haunted and that pir ates had buried treasure on the island. Wasting no time the boy, John Smith, gathered up two of his friends and retu rned to the oak spot to dig for treasure. The next day they put pick and spade to soil. Within minutes they discovered they were excavating a clearly defined circular shaft. Ten feet below the surface the boys were astonished to discover a tier of oak logs. These massive logs, presumably hewn from the old oa k trees in the surrounding area, had been snugly and expertly fitted into the walls of the shaft. In the years that followed Mcginnis and his party removed the logs and continued digging. At thirty f eet they discovered a second platform of oak timbers. The tr easure seekers realized they were no match for the enginee ring whodunit before them and sought technical assistanc e. Convinced that treasure would be theirs the Oak Isl and shaft attracted consortia after consortia of techni cal and investment types in their quest for riches. In 1804 a crew digging at fifty feet discovered ano ther oak tier. A third oak tier was discovered at sixty feet and was covered with the tough fiber of coconut palm! I n the 1860’s a story circulated that at fifty feet a “tie r of smooth stones from the beach with figures and letters cut on them .” At a depth of ninety feet, a new consortia dug away another oak platform as had been discovered at prev ious levels. This time, however, the crew found themselv es"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 0 bailing one tube of water for every two of earth. A t ninety- eight feet they felt a thud which they discerned wa s a chest. The exhausted diggers decided to wait until morning to retrieve what they hoped was the ultimate treasure. Instead, upon arrival at the shaft at first light they disco vered that it had filled with over sixty feet of water. As the years rolled by, Oak Island enthusiasts bega n to realize that some ancient genius had created an imm ense puzzle pit. In addition to sinking a shaft thirteen feet in diameter well beyond 100 feet beneath the Earth, ev ery ten feet he installed ‘hydraulic seals’ of oak and putt y. He also installed a subterranean tunnel system designed to suck water from the ocean 500 feet away. This tunnel system created a booby-trapped vault brilliantly designed to protect the Oak Island trea sure by flooding-out all seekers. F.D.R.’S OAK ISLAND AMBITION Captain Henry L. Bowdoin, a flamboyant engineer who garnered much publicity in New York, Boston and Nov a Scotia newspapers for this project, headed F.D.R.’s treasure group. Bowdoin bragged that, “modern machinery and engineering science will solve in a jiffy the diffi culties Captain Kidd made to guard his treasure.” 2 In April 1909, Bowdoin took the first step toward realizing his Oak Island ambition. He formed the Ol d Gold Salvage and Wrecking Company, with offices at 44 Broadway in New York. The company’s prospectus is illuminating in the view it yields of F.D.R.’s appr oach to the quest for the secrets of Oak Island."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 1 After salvaging the treasure of the Oak Island pit, the value of which was estimated in the millions of dol lars, Bowdoin proposed using the equipment purchased by t he stock sale in a “general salvage and wrecking busin ess.” The consortium intended to salvage sunken treasure ships throughout the world. F.D.R.’s participation took h im into the rabbit’s hole of ancient gold and relic seeking. Though it is probable F.D.R.’s group was unsuccess ful in recovering the Oak Island gold -- no one to this date, even those using the most advanced engineering techniques, has been successful in doing so -- ther e must have been something there which held his attention. F.D.R.’s personal papers include letters and articl es regarding Oak Island that date as late as 1939, whe n he was serving his second term as President of the United States. F.D.R. (third from right) at Oak Island"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 2 One of these letters was written in response to a l etter from Gilbert D. Hedden. Knowing that F.D.R. was interested in the solution to the Oak Isalnd myster y, Hedden wrote to inform the President of his purchas e of and enigineering operations at Oak Island in 1936 a nd 1937 and of an upcoming expedition. Hedden concluded the three-page letter by affirming his belief that the Oak Island vault was created before 1640 and that a mysterious stone with what are believed to be runic inscriptions was real. He wrote that “the abo ve items might possibly add an interesting chapter to your o wn (F.D.R.’s) experience as an ‘Oak Island Buccaneer’.” 3 In a letter written from Hyde Park on September 10, 1937 to Gilbert Hedden F.D.R. responded: “Dear Mr. Heddon, I am greatly interested in your letter of September first and it vividly recalls to my mind our semi-serious, semi- pleasure efforts at Oak Island nearly thirty years ago. May I suggest that you get in touch with Mr. Duncan G. Harris in New York? I think he is a member of the f irm of Brown and Wheelock, real estate. After I left Oak Island the others made some test borings and brought up a corps of what looked like cement. This they had analyzed at Columbia University and, as I remember it, the report was that it could be either very old cement concrete or a thin stratum of natural cement rock of very old origin. Certainly all of the earlier data points to a deep artificial pit and it would be a fine thing if you could clear up the mystery once and for all."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 3 I have some interesting old photographs showing the work we did and if I can find them I will send them to you to look at.” 4 In a second letter concerning Hedden, F.D.R. wrote to Duncan Harris on August 24, 1939 saying he planned to go to Mahone Bay during the summer of 1939, but a fog delay and the international situation made it impossible. He hoped, however, that Hedden’s expedition would succeed. F.D.R. had more than a casual interest in Oak Islan d. According to biographer Geoffrey C. Ward, 5 as President F.D.R. frequently used the story of the Oak Island treasure and his failure to find it as a fillibuster to pres ent visitors from bringing up topics he did not wish to discuss. During his first meeting with F.D.R. in 1933, the n ewly appointed Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, “listened in wonder as the President-elect spun the tale out for an hour and a half , while Senator Key Pittman of Nevada drummed his fingers, waiting for a chance to talk about his own pet subject, silver.” F.D.R. never le t him speak. It is thus well documented that F.D.R had a long-te rm “semi-serious, semi-pleasure” personal and financia l interest in Oak Island that continued into his pres idency. One wonders if gold was the true treasure of Oak Is land that attracted a man of F.D.R.’s wealth and intelle ctual stature -- and family background. If not gold, what then may have been buried at Oak Island? The answer appears to be directly connected with the Knights Templar. The Templar were formed c. 1100 AD (though some trace their origins to early Christ ian times). Among their earliest purposes was the recov ery of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 4 the treasure hidden within the tunnels under the Te mple of Solomon atop Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. 6 It is postulated that the Knights Templar discovere d something more valuable than gold underneath the an cient top of Moriah: the Ark of the Covenant. These ‘Knig hts of Christ’ are also reputed to have guarded the secret s of Jesus, including the Holy Grail. 7 THE HOLY GRAIL What is the Holy Grail? Throughout the ages the overwhelming majority of conventional Christians ha ve thought of the Holy Grail in its exoteric sense, as a simple carpenter’s cup whose history originated with Jesus. The Holy Grail is the focal point of the sacrifice of the Mass, and also the mystery of the Holy Communion in which Jesus’ body is offered in the form of bread a long with the communal wine, the ‘Blood of Life’. In this dimension the Holy Grail is the receptacle used by Jesus to perform the Eucharist at the Last Supper when he poured wine for the disciples to drink, saying, “this is my blood.” Jesus said, “Whoso eateth my flesh and d rink my blood has eternal life.” 8 The key to elucidating Jesus’ teaching concerning the Eucharist is to remember that the bread and wine used at the Last Supper are called the elements . The mystery teaching behind these elements are symbolized by the letter H . The secrets of the H were once in possession of the biblical patriarch Abraham who inaugurated the blood line of Christ. 9"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 5 The Bible goes to great pains to make the explicit point that after his initiation into the mysteries of the Grail by Lord Melchizedek, Abram became the new and improved Abra-H-am , 10 and his wife Sarai became SaraH. Some trace the secrets of the H to the Garden of Eden and Adam, who was also known as Adama-h. In Hebrew mysticism this H ladder is called the Sephiroth , the Mystical Tree. It features ten qualities as s et forth in the Sefer ha-Zohar , the Cabalistic Book of Splendour . Cabalists called all ten collectively the Merkaba , or “chariot of god.” According to Jewish legend, this was the initiation Abraham and Sarah received. 11 This system of mystical science is also known as the Kaballah or Sabala (since the soft ‘c’ and the ‘s’, are interchangeable so too ar e the letters ‘s’ and ‘k’ are interchangeable). According to the Sefer Yetzirah , 12 the phenomenal mystic ‘hidden scrolls’ of the Jewish tradition, Ab raham used his knowledge to make souls at a place called Harran (‘the land of holes’). As we will see, F.D.R., Nicholas Roerich, and Henry Wallace were among many Grail questers who have thought of the Grail as far more than a cup. To esotericists the Grail is a symbol of a mystery teaching that was presented by Melchizedek and then Jesus, who, according to Psalm 110, was a “priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 6 Melchizedek peforms the Eucharist.

It is vital to note that following a strict genealogy, esoteric Egyptol ogists believe Thoth reappeared in the form of an Egyptian pharaoh named Akhenaton, who ruled Egypt from 1364- 1347 BC. This coincides with the time of Moses . Akhenaton was called the ‘Heretic King’ because he defied the power of the establishment priests. He introduced a monotheistic Mystery religion based up on the principles of light from a hidden Central Sun that he called Aton, or simply ‘the Disk’. He is frequently depict ed receiving the Key of Life from Aton. Aton is a word play for a tone or a tune . Aton is also the root for Adon or “Lord,” a term later applied to Jesus. The myths I accumulated in my book The Peacemaker and the Key of Life 14 record that the Key of Life may be used to transfer souls from one dimension to anothe r, level mountains, control natural phenomena, and for heali ng. It is one facet of the secrets of Jesus guarded by the Templar.Given the Templar connection to the Grail a nd Oak Island, it is reasonable to speculate that F.D. R. sought to recover a portion of the Grail secrets, or learn where these secrets were located. I presume these teachings primarily fall into three categories. The first category of secrets is a means to establi sh a social order, a Kingdom of Heaven on Earth, based o n spiritual principles. Interestingly, at the end tim e, said the Essene Dead Sea Scrolls, the star or light to the w est called Merika would shine. 15"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 1 In this context, the ordinary people transformed by Jesus’ teachings would be capable of perceiving or manifesting the higher vibrational world of the Kin gdom of Heaven. Nicholas Roerich called this new Kingdom Shambhala, which was located atop mystic Mount Meru . Franklin D. Roosevelt called it the ‘New Deal’. He called the presidential hide-away in Maryland “Shangrila.” Ike renamed it Camp David. The names “Shangrila” and “Shambhalla” are both derived from Sabala . The second category of secrets is documents tracing the genealogies of David and Jesus into the bloodlines of the royal bloodlines of the Merovingian and other dynas ties of Europe, and a prophecy of the Second Coming. According to the most recent Oak Island theories, t he genealogy of ‘David’ is believed to be included in the manuscripts allegedly housed at Oak Island. 16 These manuscripts came from Rosslyn chapel near Edinburgh, Scotland. Built by William St Clair Ross lyn or Roslin was so named because it was home to a healing well. Roslin comes from the two Celtic words, R o s , meaning a ‘promontory’, and lin , meaning a ‘waterfall’, although later members of the family saw Ros as meaning ‘red’ or ‘rose’ and Roslin as signifying the Blood of Christ, or the Holy Blood. 17 Queen Margaret was said to have started the Roslin healing waters flowing when she poured into its wel l a vial of St. Catherine’s blood from the saint’s monastery on Mount Sinai. Catharine was the namesake of the Cathars and the dancer of the fiery wheel at the central point in Heaven -- the Druid’s Tula. She was brought to Earth by Sir G alahad,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 2 the last pure knight to possess the Grail. Margaret ordered a chapel built over the well. William St Clair was kn ighted and given the lands of Roslin. Although she was thought to have lived shortly afte r the time of Constantine the Great ( c. 325 AD), the man who gave us modern Christianity, Catherine’s story was never recorded until the 9th century. In the 15th century, attempts were made to banish Catherine from the pantheon of saints on the ground s that she was pagan. According to legend, she was the daughter of a Pharaoh (who is presumed to be Akhenaton) who remained a virgin, converted to Christianity and ma rried Christ, receiving from him the mystical ring (‘key’ ?) of his marriage. In receiving this ‘ring’ she sounds an aw ful lot like Mary Magdalene whom the Templars claimed recei ved Jesus’ Key of Life. 18 Essentially, the “quest for the Grail” was the ques t to get our DNA to ring, sing or vibrate a certain way. This created a “love song in the blood,” a San Graal or Song Grail, tuning us to the Key of Life or the tone of immortality. As the Key of Life, the Grail offers a way to trans form our blood to make a connection to the energy of hig her (heavenly) realms which promise accelerated evoluti on and the transformation of body and soul. This translate s into immense personal spiritual power, including the abi lity to restore the Life Force to the dead. It was the secrets of this Key of Life/Grail that w as deposited at Rosslyn and moved to Oak Island, possi bly along with the geneaology of David and Jesus’ family."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 3 The third category of Oak Island secrets is an alchemical process for controlling the elements and activating the hidden power of the human body. By s trict definition the Holy Grail is a Philosopher’s or Alc hemist’s Stone. This potent catalyst can cure all ills, gran t eternal youth and can turn one element into another. As bel ieved by the alchemists, the Grail’s esoteric secrets, sy mbolized by the H , and the Christ Light halo surrounding Jesus’ head, are a formative power that enable one to crea te souls and to transmute the elements... the Periodic Table o f Elements that is. This process can ignite long dormant human capabilities revealed by a Christ Light, the origin al light/wisdom of spiritual consciousness that transf orms a Homo sapiens into a new type of being, Homo Christos . Understanding this aspect of the secrets of the Gra il Stone provides a cornucopia of benefits including t he ability to transmute matter, as for example lead in to gold, and to control nature, including transforming human beings into shining higher forms and coaxing atoms into nu clear chain reactions. This process was demonstrated at t he Last Supper and at the Crucifixion. These are the three mysteries of the Holy Grail. As we will see, possession of any of these secrets assure s immense spiritual, political and military power. Alexander the Great, Constantine, Hitler, all sought these secrets."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 4 CHAPTER TWO THE NUCLEAR SECRETS OF THE GRAIL According to lore, when the Grail is discovered and the Golden Age commences every inhabitant of the Earth will know and understand how the universe works. An age of miracles will begin. To some the real treasure the Grail (S)tone offers is spiritual gold, the way to find the ‘light within’ and the ‘power without’. In the process of researching the ‘three wise men’s ’ extraordinary relationship and their search for the Grail, I made a discovery that may even be more intriguing t o some and startling to others. This discovery concerned t he inner nature of the Holy Grail and compelled me to make a scientific search for evidence linking the secrets of nuclear fission and the secrets of the Holy Grail. I will show how the results of F.D.R.’s search for the secret temple of the Christ Light and the Grail may have been used in the development of the atomic bomb. Most Christians are unaware that there is enormous military advantage to be gained by possessing the s ecrets of the Grail. Many Grail researchers focus on the Shro ud of Turin, the linen cloth alleged to be the burial shr oud of Christ, in their quest to answer Grail questions."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 5 Some Grail researchers claim the Grail and the Shro ud of Turin is the same thing. In addition to being a profound key to the Crucifixion, through the centuries the S hroud (or Grail) has enjoyed a fabled reputation as a palladi um possessing great powers of military protection. Like the Ark of Covenant, the Shroud was both a symbol of humankind’s covenant with God, but also a weapons system with enormous destructive power. Fin d the inner secrets of the Grail, and you find military p ower beyond your wildest dreams. In 544, it had reportedly saved the city of Edessa (Thomas’ religious center) from a siege by the migh ty Persian army. Since that time many warriors through out history, including F.D.R. and Hitler, sought the mi litary advantage of waving the Shroud or Grail in an enemy ’s face. Edward Gibbon described the protective virtues of t he Shroud images as follows: “In the hour of danger or tumult their venerable presence could revive the hope, rek indle the courage, or repress the fury of the Roman legions.” 1 In the sixth century, Pope Gregory commissioned his own copy of the Shroud. He had it brought to Rome w here it was subsequently invoked for protection by Popes of the eighth and ninth centuries. In 944, the Byzantine Emperor forced the transfer of the original image from Edessa (where it had been hidde n above the gates to the city) to Constantinople in o rder to obtain “ a new, powerful source of divine protection ” for the capital city. Consequently, the peoples of Edessa a nd Constantinople came to view the Shroud as possessin g “palladian” virtues that could protect."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 6 The frontal view of the man on the Shroud of Turin, as seen on the photographic negative"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 7 The Shroud is discovered hidden above the gate of Edessa."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 8 The Keramion?

This face bears an uncanny resembla nce to the face on the Shroud. Is it Jesus?"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 9 For this reason many copies of the Grail, as a cup, and the Shroud cloth were made. This has led to specula tion that the Shroud of Turin is a forgery. While many believe the Shroud should be treated les s as a holy relic than as a palladium wielded by the Emperor, if authentic, it is the only known artifact of the Crucifixion (and Jesus’ life for that matter). There is no mention in the Gospels of what Jesus looked like. It is unlikely that there was ever a p ortrait of Jesus made in his lifetime because of the rigidity with which the Jews interpreted the second commandment. No blood samples of Jesus are said to exist. So, it is impossible to say for certain that the man depicted in the Shroud is or is not Jesus. However, the parallels b etween the moment in time captured by the Shroud and the s tory of the Crucifixion of Jesus are striking. In 1898, Secondo Pia, an amateur Italian photograph er was appointed to take the first-ever official photo graph of the Shroud. When he developed the photographs he fo und, to his amazement, that there appeared to be a photo graphic likeness of Jesus. The Shroud has the front and back images of a cruci fied man as if the linen had been wrapped around the bod y from the feet up over the head and back down to the feet , leaving complete front and back images -- including what ap pear to be bloodstains.

One researcher who has deeply considered this quest ion is Thaddeus Trenn, Ph.D., Director of the Science a nd Religion Course Program at the University of Toront o, Canada.

Dr. Trenn hypothesizes that the body inside the Shr oud experienced a dematerialization due to the influx of intense energy that overcame the strong (nuclear) forces th at bind the protons and neutrons, and released the matter i nto energy -- instantly. He was provoked into formulating his hypothesis by the work of other scientists who have shown evidence th at the Shroud images are X-rays .

Finding these answers yields tremendous power, both spiritually and militarily speaking. NAZI TRAFFIC In addition to F.D.R., Wallace and Roerich, the Naz is were also searching for the secrets of the Grail. I n the 1930’s there was heavy Nazi traffic at several of t he locations reputed to be the last known whereabouts of the Grail. Hitler cast himself as the new Germanic Christ or Messiah who aspired to create a Thousand-Year Reich populated by a new, genetically superior human bein g. In pursuit of his aims, in 1935 Hitler directed SS chi ef Heinrich Himmler to create the “Lebensborn” (“Fount ain of Life”) one of many Nazi eugenics programs aimed at ensuring the Aryans would be the master race. Blond and blue eyed Nordic women were urged to bear the children of tall, fit SS officers to produce a master race for Hitler. Many of these conceptions took place in cemeteries specifically selected by Himmler because they contained the graves of dead Aryan warriors. 3 This ten-year experiment, say researchers, resulted in 10,000 children. Discovering the secrets of the Grail would insure Hitler’s success not only in creating the Aryan elite race but also in building atomic weapons, the force behind the Reich that would enrich Hitler’s dreams."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 3 3 On August 2nd 1939, just before the beginning of World War II, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to Pre sident Roosevelt. Einstein and several other refugee scien tists of Hitler’s Europe told the President that the Nazi sc ientists were perilously close to building an atomic bomb. In response, F.D.R.’s administration quickened development of the American A-bomb, the forerunner of the H-bomb. In 1945, eleven years after F.D.R.’s se arch for the Grail, American scientists working at Los Alamo s exploded the first atomic bomb. This was the result of the profound undertaking kno wn as the Manhattan Project, a massive secret project committed to beating the Nazis to the bomb. Over th e course of six years, ranging from 1939 to 1945, mor e than 2 billion dollars were spent on the Manhattan Proje ct. Comprised of some of the greatest minds of all time , the Manhattan Project employed thousands of people and operated from a massive facility constructed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee with branch offices in Los Alamos, New Mexico; Hanford, Washington; and in Britain. My research has led me to believe that the Nazi and American search for the Holy Grail and the developm ent of atomic weapons that could eliminate whole populatio ns in the wink of an eyelash may be linked in ways, which have previously gone undetected by historians.

This secret place was also a place of pleasure where enl ightened beings were granted every wish (due to the fact tha t they could manipulate matter with the Life Force energy) . The Greeks called it T a r t a r u s , from the ‘tortoise’. The American Indians called it Turtle Island. We call it North America. If indeed F.D.R. had acquired expert knowledge concerning the Grail mysteries at Oak Island, it wo uld be expected that he would follow the path of the Grail .

Presently it refused to work, a nd then the other.” Until this time F.D.R. had been known as a vigorous and physical man who was constantly in motion. By n ow a father of six, he had served in the New York legisl ature for two years, been assistant secretary of the Navy for seven years and his party’s candidate for Vice President in 1920. By August 12, Roosevelt could not stand or even mov e his legs. He suffered severe pain. His back, arms, and hands became powerless. He was paralyzed from the waste d own.

The man emerged completely warm-hearted, with new humility of spirit and firmer understanding of profound philosophical concepts .” 3 In other words, he returned from his descent into H ell, as all Grail questers do, with increased love and self- knowledge, revelation . It is remarkable to me the way in which F.D.R. enac ted the archetypal drama of the Grail King, the wounded Fisher King who supervises the transformation of his desol ate kingdom into a garden through the transformative po wer of the Grail. Suppose for the sake of argument that as a brillian t young man F.D.R. discovered even a portion of the s ecret Templar cache at Oak Island, or maps or other clues pointing in the direction of their real location. If F.D.R. could demonstrate his personal control ov er the contents of the Oak Island repository, or more fantastically demonstrate his knowledge of the exac t nature of its secrets, would that not have increased his p olitical stature considerably? Would this discovery also not compel him to continue his search for the Grail? These questions are not intended to diminish F.D.R. in any way. In fact, it is my view that if answered in the affirmative they would demonstrate his shrewdness a nd further reinforce the notion that F.D.R. was a grea t man with a powerful spiritual destiny. The indisputable fact is that F.D.R. continued his search for the Grail during his presidency. The question b efore us is did he recover more of these secrets as Presiden t?

As this veil lifts we will perceive anoth er facet of F.D.R. -- a Grail knight who became a Grail king wh o may have discovered the transmutational secrets of the Grail and used them to develop the A-bomb. SYNCHRONICITY AND THE GRAIL Historians note that the scientific effort to split the atom had been underway long before F.D.R (and Hitler) so ught the secrets of the Grail. This is true. However, historians pay very little, if any, attent ion at all to the occult or spiritual beliefs of the scien tists engaged in this process. Often, when confronted with evidence that scientist s, politicians or military figures have mystic leaning s (particularly those in contrast with the tenets of Christianity), they simply dismiss this evidence. In this omission lays a vast, untapped reservoir of esoteric history. Occult is a Latin word that means ‘hidden’. It has the dual meaning ‘that which we don’t want to face’. Lacking knowledge or understanding of spiritual or occult sciences, explains why many historians have had a tendency to turn a blind eye to the occult and myst ical contemplation’s of history’s greatest scientists an d political figures and the role of these beliefs in humankind’ s greatest discoveries. Other historians ignore them for reasons of religio us bigotry. For these reasons, and others, the occult nature of the splitting of the atom, particularly its connect ion to the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 4 1 Holy Grail, has deflected the historian’s further i nterest and escaped public attention. I will apply the science of mythology to a field th at has never questioned the occult nature of the developme nt of the A-bomb. I do this not in an effort to prove his torians wrong. Rather, to bring light to an already amazing story. I will demonstrate that when one turns to the stori es of the participants of the development of the A-bomb, both political and scientific, and their spiritual or oc cult view of what they believed they were doing when they split the atom, as opposed to the historian‘s spiritually san itized view, a completely different story emerges. Speculative though it may be, it is my contention, based upon applying the science of mythology to their wor ds and actions, that the participants in the Manhattan Pro ject, including F.D.R., were a group of people in obvious synchronicity with the “consciousness” of the Holy Grail. They were living in the shadows of the Christ Light . The extent and cohesiveness of the many coincidences or synchronicities are as astonishing as they are expl osive in their implications. SYNCHRONICITY What is a synchronicity and how can this offer proo f of my thesis? A synchronicity is a meaningful coincidence. Life i s full of these events. For example, have you ever thought of a friend calling at the instant that the telephone ri ngs and it is they on the other end?"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 4 2 That is a synchronicity. History, especially scient ific and literary and scientific history, is full of these a t times bizarre occurrences. When Norman Mailer first visualized his novel Barbury Shore there was no Russian spy in it. As the story unfold ed, a Russian spy emerged as a main character. Soon, th e spy became a major character. After completing the nove l, Mailer learned the Immigration Service had arrested a man who lived one floor below Mailer’s apartment. He wa s charged as a top spy in the United States at that time. Physicist Wolfgang Pauli and occult-minded Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Carl G. Jung named the concept of synchronicity (from s y n , same and chronus , time). 4 Synchronicities have been called the bridge between matter and mind. They strike unexpectedly like lightning, alerting the individual to the existence of a hidden order, a creative universal energy, expressing itself in individual lives. As a disciple of Sigmund Freud, Jung believed the s oul was constantly trying to get the ego’s attention. T he soul, including the “collective soul” of humanity, engine ers all sorts of attempts to call us into spiritual initiat ion. Synchronicities are the “calling cards” that we are on the path. Once we are on our way these happen constantly transforming our existence into one of effortless h armony. The appearance of synchronicities in history highli ghts the presence of the unseen hand guiding humanity. Wolfgang Pauli was an Austrian physicist who won th e 1945 Nobel Prize in physics for his proposal in 192 5 of a rule explaining the behavior of electrons in atoms. This discovery enabled scientists to picture the atomic structure"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 4 3 and the behavior of the electrons of every known ch emical element. Because the behavior of an atom’s electron s determines how it will take part in chemical reacti ons, Pauli’s discovery also explained the chemical characteristics of the elements. It was instrumenta l in developing the A-bomb. Pauli was also a patient of Dr. Jung whose studies of mythology convinced him that archetypes of gods and supernatural powers are deeply rooted in the collec tive unconscious of humanity. These archetypes appear repeatedly in age after human age guiding humanity toward enlightenment. Jung poured over more than a thousan d of Pauli’s dreams and visual impressions. Jung concluded that the symbolism floating along th e physicist’s stream of consciousness was astonishing ly similar to that of the Taoists of ancient China who claimed to possess the secrets of physical immortality, and the medieval alchemists who claimed possession of the G rail’s secrets of chemical transmutation. 5 Pauli’s subconscious images also contained symbols of the early Gnostics (including the Essenes and later the Cathars) who believed salvation was achieved by love and revelation of the Chirst Light or wisdom of the Grail. This special scientific knowledge was contained wit hin what Jung called “the collective unconscious” of hu manity. The collective unconscious may be thought of as the “global brain” of humanity, or the “spiritual Inter net.” It is said to contain all the sacred knowledge of the universe. In fact, in Egyptian legend, Thoth, the Egyptian pr iest- scientist, Peacemaker, purveyor of the Emerald Tabl ets and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 4 4 patron god of alchemy, ‘projected’ 36,525 books containing all sacred knowledge into the sky. 6 I refer to this Grail library as the “Thought Spher e” of humanity. Jung believed the alchemists and Grail qu esters were tapping into the collective unconscious. I bel ieve this is the same as the Thought Sphere of Thoth and that this knowledge is available to all who learn to ‘download’ it. Like Paul on the road to Damascus, Pauli’s story of the green light of gnosis dropping out of the thought s phere (like the Russian spy dropping out of the ceiling i nto Mailer’s Barbury Shore ) to synchronize his mind with Grail consciousness, is a story of the conversion o f a man by the power of the Christ Light. In the Greek version of his famous hymn to love, Pa ul wrote that “I have prophetic powers and understand all the mysteries and all the knowledge.” 7 The specific mysteries and knowledge to which Paul refers is the Grail knowledge revealed by Jesus at the Last Supper and after his Crucifixion. As a result of his enlightenment, Wolfgang Pauli wa s cured of his alcoholism and depression. He emerged reborn and returned from his baptism in fire with a key to all the mysteries of the atom. Pauli’s story is one of dozens of those involved in the development of the A-bomb that feature synchronicit ies with Christ and Grail imagery. The frequency of the appearance of this imagery mak es one wonder if an unseen hand were operating behind the scenes, ‘two floors up’, carefully scripting this d rama, or if an atomic muse comes over people like a psychic clo ud, raining seed ideas in their consciousness."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 4 5 TRUTH OR COINCIDENCES? Consider, for example, the synchronicities involvin g the Christ and Grail imagery found in the place names surrounding the first detonation of the A-bomb. What began as a hope, a dream and a fantasy for all the participants of the Manhattan Project came down to a day of destiny: July 16th, 1945 . On this fateful midsummer morning, all at Los Alamo s, where the Gadget (code-named as such during its development) was built, would learn whether or not it was going to be a dud or if it would blast open a gatew ay to a new age. The moment of truth came at 5:29:45 a.m. (Mountain War Time). The first A-bomb lit up the sky from ato p a one-hundred-foot steel tower at the Trinity Test Site (its code name) in the remote flats of Alamogordo Air Fo rce Base called Jornade Del Muerto or “the Death Journey.” It exploded just below La Luz or “the Light,” in the desert lands of New Mexico or “New Place of the God of War.” Alamogordo is two hundred miles south of Los Alamos National Laboratories (code-named Shangrila ), itself in the shadows of the Sangre de Cristo or “Blood of Christ” mountains northeast of Santa Fe.

JADE GREEN GLASS As the fireball of the explosion of the first A-bom b began shooting upwards at 360 feet per second it fi rst turned orange, then reddened, pulsing blue, purple and green as it cooled. The brilliant light from the de tonation illuminated the early morning skies with such inten sity that residents from a distant neighboring community woul d swear that the sun came up twice that day. Even more astonishing is the story that a blind gir l reportedly saw the flash 120 miles away.

In the eyes of Holy Grail historian Andrew Sinclair , 7 this ‘mushroom cloud’ is more properly a chalice or cauldron -- a grail -- of destruction. For centuries it has been claimed that his family, the St. Clairs of Sco tland, who built Rosslyn Chapel, have guarded the secrets of the Grail. Sinclair or St. Clair means “Holy Light.” Prophets have awaited the time when the secrets of the Holy or Christ Light will be released and the primo rdial powers of the Grail will rise to fulfill its destiny.

Even though the scientists involved with the Manhat tan Project believed they were peacemakers who were sav ing the world, this is hardly spiritual work. As Jesus says, “By their fruits ye shall known them.” Any time spiritual knowledge is evoked one must tes t the spirit. And the only true test of spirit is, do es the thing in question advance the goals of the Grail, service to humankind through: love (compassion) and revelation (truth)?

The fruits of my investigation -- the appreciation of the synchronicities between the stories of the particip ants who revealed the secrets of the atom and Christ and Gra il imagery -- and the resulting fusion of science and religion, I believe, will speak for themselves. They go a long way toward explaining the origins of my hypothesis, and I believe, offer initial support for my sensational claims. As will become clear as we proceed, there is more t han enough additional historical evidence to support th em. We will find a great deal of this evidence in comparin g the history of the development of the A-bomb found in h istory books with the Grail stories and the works of Jesus which encode the Grail mysteries.

This picture will be the great metaphysical work of my summer.” 8 The result was his masterpiece Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubicus) . THE LANGUAGE OF THE GRAIL Like Dali Roerich was a master of occult symbolism, the “language of the subconcious.” A third way we w ill discover the Grail’s nuclear secrets is to utilize the symbolic occult language in which the Grail mysteri es are written: the Language of the Birds. The Language of the Birds is called a ‘phonetic cab ala’, a phonetic language code. This code equates words t hat sound alike in different languages, connecting word concepts by sound in English . The language connections reveal astonishing literary and historical synchronicities. What did F.D.R. find during the search for Christ i n Mongolia? How did this search impact the developmen t of the A-bomb and, later, the H-bomb? To begin to answer these questions from the histori cal point of view is difficult. Nearly all of what F.D.

As the ancient texts declare, “If yo u would speak with the gods you must first learn the langua ge of the gods.” As we will see, F.D.R., Churchill and others told t he world exactly what they were doing. The world, howe ver, was not listening, or did not know the meaning of w hat the three wise men were saying. F.D.R., Henry Wallace and Nicholas Roerich frequently used terms from the apocryphal and forbidden works of various related traditions. These are the history texts and religious works excluded from the authorized canon, the books ‘official’ his torians systematically omit in their presentations of histo ry, and the leaders of Christianity have sought to discredit or destroy. In our search we will be keying on the apocryphal w orks of Jesus. After the Crucifixion, these works say, Jesus routi nely appeared to the disciples to give further instructi on, sometimes even concerning the Grail. These meetings usually took place beside water, and involved Jesus blowing in the faces of the disciple s to increase their spiritual vision.

LEO THE LIZARD Bohr’s announcement of the German splitting of the atom at the Washington conference is remembered in physics circles as a volti face or “JFK” moment when lightning struck from the skies to behead the reign ing king. Everything changed from that moment forward. The age of innocence was over. Humankind had negotiated a new deal with God. By the afternoon of Bohr’s announcement, scientists from Johns Hopkins University in nearby Baltimore duplicated the German results. Bohr, along with Edw ard Teller, Merle Tuve and Larry Hafstad, bolted for Ca rnegie- Mellon’s laboratory. They put coffee on the stove, a log on the fire, and as Tuve said, “a new filament in the particle accelerator.” 4 Shortly before midnight they too split a uranium nucleus. Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the German success was that it was relatively easy to duplicat e. Years later Teller, a Hungarian physicist who came to Ame rica in 1935 and became known as the father of the H-bomb, commented that the atom splitting technique of the German experiments “had been lurking under the surface of physics for years, waiting for someone to discover it.” As I am attempting to show, the transmutational sec rets of the A-bomb had been floating on the surface of h uman consciousness for millennia waiting for a person to perceive them."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 5 8 One prominent physicist, who well understood the implications of this new covenant, and the urgency in waking up the American government to the cold hard facts facing the free world, was Leo Szilard. He, unfortu nately, was at home in Princeton, New Jersey with the flu d uring the pivotal Washington conference. Within days, however, he was in the nation’s capito l conferring with Edward Teller. Szilard feared the N azi monsters would soon have the possibility of using u ranium to create an explosive a million times more powerfu l than any other known bomb, and a way to shove their reli gious ideology down the throat of the world. Leo Szilard (known to his friends as “Leo the Lizar d”) was a genius who believed his life’s mission was to help save the world. He said this proclivity was inspire d by the stories his mother told him as a child, and two wor ks of fiction. In 1932 he read his friend H.G. Wells’ prophetic 19 14 novel The World Set Free . In it the science fiction writer spoke of the atomic age and dreamed of saving the w orld through the power of the atom. Wells foresaw the liberation of atomic energy on a large scale for industrial purposes, the developmen t of atomic bombs, and a world war which was apparently fought by an alliance of England, France and perhap s including America, against Germany and Austria, the powers located in the central part of Europe. Wells placed the war in 1956. All the major cities of the world were obliterated by atomic bombs. Szilard’s next great influence was a visionary Hungarian poem called The Tragedy of Man . The"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 5 9 brainchild of a utopian Hungarian nobleman named Im re Madach, this poem told the story of Adam, Eve, and Lucifer (‘the light bringer’). Lucifer takes Adam o n a stroll through history; a history that Lucifer persuades A dam to conclude is pointless. When the human experiment ultimately ends, Adam concludes that while human life is pointless it is still imperative that we hang on to and aspire toward hig h ideals. In later years Szilard would point to this poem, mo re than Wells’ work, as the primary source of his ‘sav e the world’ mentality. He was out to prevent the human experiment from failing. Together with two other Hungarian-born geniuses, Edward Teller, and Eugene Paul Wigner, Szilard set about fulfilling this goal by convincing the American gov ernment that they needed to beat Hitler to the bomb. THE EINSTEIN LETTER Their first meeting was with the United States Navy . At first the Navy expressed interest in the possibilit y of a nuclear bomb, but committed no action or resources to the project. Nervous about the Navy’s lack of action, a nd concerned that the Nazis would build the first nucl ear bomb, Szilard, Teller and Wigner asked for help fro m a man who was considered closest to God in many American’s minds: Albert Einstein. On Sunday, July 30, 1939 Szilard and Teller packed themselves into Teller’s 1935 Plymouth and drove to see Einstein at his rented summer home in Peconic, Long"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 6 0 Island. 5 Teller recalled that they had difficulty finding t he professor’s house. Finally they found a ten-year-ol d girl and asked her for directions to Dr. Einstein’s home . She couldn’t help them. Then Szilard asked where the ma n with the long, flowing white hair lived. With that they were given accurate directions to Einstein’s house. At first, Einstein’s pacifist sensibilities prevent ed him from endorsing a weapon capable of killing thousand s of people at a time. But then, the Hungarians persuade d Einstein to sign a letter to President Roosevelt. In one of the most famous letters of all history (w hich many historians believe was actually written by Szi lard), Einstein informed the President of the potential ci vilian uses of nuclear chain reactions. This “new phenomen on,” as it was called in the letter, would also lead to military uses, including the construction of a new type of b omb. He requested financial support for Szilard’s research. The letter was to be hand-delivered by Alexander Sachs, a New York banker, economist, biologist, pow er broker and personal friend of President Roosevelt. 6 Though dated August 2, 1939 F.D.R. did not read the letter until October 11. In the interim World War II began when Germany invaded Poland and Great Britain and France declare d war on Germany (on September 3). On September 8, F.D.R. ordered a state of limited national emergency in th e U.S. This left little time for talk about atom bombs say s historians.

The chairman was Lyman J. Briggs, originally a soil physicist who worked for Henry A. Wallace at the Department of Agriculture. 8 The other members were Lieutenant Colonel Keith F. Adamson (Army) and Commander Gilbert C. Hoover (Navy), both ordinance experts. 9 At first the physicists had a difficult time persua ding the government officials that this “atomic mumbo-ju mbo” was real. Adamson, in particular, was most immune t o their persuasion and to imagining the feasibility of this “Buck Rogers” project. Splitting the invisible atom to create a superbomb sounded more like science fiction than science fact . Stories had circulated for years about Nikola Tesla’s famed death ray. At the Army’s Aberdeen Proving Ground near Baltimore it was claimed they had a goat tied to a pole with a $10,000 prize around its neck for the first perso n that could kill the goat with a death ray. The goat was still enjoying the green grass of the proving ground. 10"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 6 4 Besides, argued Adamson, moral issues, not big guns , were the true sources of victory in war. The Nazis had apparently never heard of Adamson’s military philos ophy. They were too busy running over Poland with their monstrous new Panzer tanks enroute to the commencem ent of the second European genocide. Finally, on February 20, 1940, the first allocation of funds from the Army and Navy were transferred to th e researchers at Columbia University at Broadway and 120th Street in Manhattan for the purchase of research ma terials. Total transferred -- $6,000. This meager investment paid off handsomely. By the time the committee met again on April 28, 1940, res earch had proven that of the three uranium isotopes only U-235 would fission. The Germans were putting big money i nto their uranium research as well. So this was a good indicator they were on the right track. The physicists requested an additional $100,000 wor th of uranium and $40,000 for graphite to continue the ir work... to test the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction. TRUTH On May 8, 1940 as the cherry trees encircling the T idal Basin in Washington bloomed, Hitler stormed France, Holland, Luxembourg and Belgium.

The theme of Roosevelt’s speech was the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 6 5 search for Truth, something he had been questing fo r since he was a young man. He told the scientists that: “ In contrast to that rather simple picture of our id eals , in other parts of the world teachers and scholars a re not permitted to search for the truth , lest the truth, when made known, might not suit the designs of their masters . Too often they are not allowed to teach the truth as th ey see it, because truth might make men free... .” 11 By the end of the speech it was clear that F.D.R. w as not asking the scientists to consider using their i ntelligence to stop Hitler, he was telling them the burden was on their shoulders.

With chaos erupting in Europe the President was als o preparing to run for his third term in office. For his running mate he had chosen Henry A. Wallace, his Secretary of Agriculture, and one of the most controversial figu res of the New Deal period. A plant geneticist from Iowa w ho had developed the first hybrid corn for commercial use, Wallace was the only scientist on F.D.R.’s Cabinet.

His father was also on the st aff of Iowa State College in Ames for several years in add ition to serving as Secretary of Agriculture under Warren G. Harding. While his father taught in Ames, Henry A. became friendly with George Washington Carver, to whom he attributed his love of plants. 1 2 Hailed as the savior of southern agriculture, he was a black American geniu s, and former slave, from Missouri. Carver worked his way through high school and colle ge, eventually receiving a master’s degree in agricultu re from Iowa State University. He won international fame fo r his agricultural research. He was especially noted for his work with peanuts, and the mysterious way he communicate d with plants. He was reputed to know the language of nature, and the secrets of the soil (the elements). His unusual gifts in grafting plants (fusing parts of t wo plants so that they grow as one) and cross-fertilizing the m (transferring the germinating cells from one plant to another) are legendary. One day, Carver was conversing with nature on the Iowa State grounds when an exceptionally bright six -year- old boy walked up on him. The boy began asking him quite serious questions.

Wallace attended Iowa State College, graduating in 1910, when he joined the family journal as an assoc iate editor. During the next twenty-three years he culti vated an outstanding reputation as editor of one of the lead ing farm journals, a brilliant scientist who developed the f irst strains of hybrid corn, and as founder of what is now Pione er Hi- bred International, Inc. a billion dollar seed comp any. In 1933 Wallace was appointed Secretary of Agriculture under F.D.R. and served for two terms, throughout t he Great Depression. During this nervous moment in American history he was responsible for the administration of the Agric ultural Adjustment Acts and other relief measures that brou ght stability to the nation’s desperate farmers, helpin g them to feed a hungry America. 14 PHOTOSYNTHESIS Wallace’s brilliance as a scientist was instrumenta l in helping F.D.R. in early decisions leading to the development of the A-bomb. At first glance it seems nonsensical that a plant geneticist could be of ass istance to the President when it came to making decisions abou t releasing the light of the atom. Upon further consideration, however, this makes a g reat deal of sense. The chief function of leaves of green plants is food making through photosynthesis , something Wallace"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 7 0 understood quite well from his walks with George Washington Carver and his college training. The word photosynthesis means putting together with light . Photosynthesis is derived from photon (‘light’), syn (‘together’) and thesis (‘to put’). 15 A photon is a quantum of light, or the smallest possible packet of light at a given wavelength. An atom during a transition from one en ergy state to another emits photons. Fusion ( the opposite of fission) is another word for putting together. Photosynthesis, therefore, is a synonym for light fusion . During photosynthesis, the cells in green plants un dergo two simultaneous reactions, both of which rely on a separate kind of protein. Photosystem I protein mol ecules use the trapped energy in sunlight to convert carbo n dioxide into carbon and oxygen. Sometimes called “t he Earth’s power station,” the proteins provide the pl ant food in the form of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids -- the building blocks of life. Photosystem I I protein molecules use light energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for plant respiration. Plants use energy from light to fuse carbon dioxide and water to make food. All our food comes from this pr ofound energy-converting activity of green plants. Light e nergy is converted to chemical energy and is stored in the f ood that is made by green plants. Animals eat the plants, an d we eat animal products as well as plants. Without the Phot osystem molecules, life as we know it would cease to exist.

WALLACE THE THEOSOPHIST In addition to his training by Carver, arguably a shaman, it is key to remember that Henry Wallace wa s an expert on corn, and he was a Theosophist. Once elucidated, the connection between these two seemingly unrelate d subjects -- corn and Theosophy -- is absolutely ato mic in its implications. During the 1920’s and early 1930’s Wallace was on a search for spiritual methods of bringing the “Inner Light toward manifestation.” 16 The secret of doing so, Wallace believed, was hidde n in nature and in the works of the Theosophists. Perhap s from his early days spent walking with George Washington Carver, Wallace developed a deep appreciation for t he close relationship between religion and nature. He was interested in any teaching that brought him closer to the forces of nature. Growing up in Iowa he saw first-h and the control nature had over life. Some years were bount iful. Others, like the early 1930’s were soul destroying in the brutal nothingness nature delivered. Wallace also recognized the works of Ralph Waldo Trine as a primary influence on his developing Theosophical viewpoint as a young boy, particularly Trine’s In Tune with the Infinite . Trine writes of the “Spirit of Infinite Life” as a form of consciousness ( Nous ), a spirit, which was responsible for inspiring Christ, Buddha,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 7 2 Brahmin and all other great teachers. Wallace also allowed the seeds of the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson to ta ke root in the fertile soil in his mind. 18 Wallace must have felt spiritually validated, if no t liberated, when in the 1920’s, he came into contact with Theosophy, a religion based upon the belief that a human being is “a Spark of the divine Fire.” 17 Logo of the Theosophical Society Theosophy is distinguished from Christianity and ot her western religions that propose the existence of an omniscient and omnipotent god in its proposal that everyone and everything is God, and God is the Divine"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 7 3 Fire.

It was the philosophy of The Theosophical Society, founded in 1899 in New York b y Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatksy (HPB), the Russian woman McCall’s magazine called “The Founding Mother of the Occult in America.” 19 Madame Helena P. Blavatsky"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 7 4 One fundamental tenet of Theosophy is the Eastern philosophy that the history of the world is cyclica l rather than linear, as in the Western view, with time runn ing only one way, forward. In the Eastern “perennial philoso phy,” human civilization is built, smashed, and then buil t again and again. Timeless wisdom, and Newton’s “true scie nce,” is revealed, lost, restored through the cycle of the ages. 20 Life is a spiraling path. In each segment of the jo urney, civilizations experience moments of uncertainty. In order to transcend it we must retrace our steps on the spira ling path. Examining the turn before will tell us how to trans cend the turn ahead. The Theosophists believed the civilizat ion of Atlantis was the turn before our present civilizati on. The New Atlantis, proposed by Francis Bacon, was the tu rn ahead. THE MAHATMAS The power pack driving the Theosophical Society was HPB’s insistence that she was in possession of secr et teachings and writings that came from the Masters o f Wisdom or Mahatmas . HPB had been deeply influenced by the initiatory romantic novels written by the Engli sh statesman and occultist Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton ( 1803- 1873), the man perhaps best known for giving us the opening line, “it was a dark and stormy night.” Today, Bulwer-Lytton’s book The Coming Race is the needle in the haystack of all occult books.

These beings, known as the Ana , were forced into the inner Earth because of Earth changes, specifica lly a flood that destroyed their civilization thousands o f years before the Biblical cataclysm. The name “theosophy” was proposed by founding member Charles Sotheran. However, according to HPB, the word “theosophy“ originated in the third century AD when Ammonius Saccas and his disciples attempted to puri fy their souls, and connect with the Source, so as to receive divine secrets. Saccas and his disciples were descendents of Pythagoras (the first “philosopher” and personal fr iend of Buddha) and Plato (the Greek “father of Atlantology ”), and were highly influenced by the Orphic and Egyptian mystery schools. (The Nazis later spent enormous sums attem pting to find the super-science of Atlantis and to develo p Pythagoras’ theory of vibration into weapons systems.) One basic premise of Theosophy is the belief that wisdom is accessible to the human soul through dire ct intuition or transmission. HPB believed that ancien t civilizations, such as Greek and Egyptian, had a fa r greater understanding of the relation between the soul and the Source. She considered the ancient teachers to be considerably more advanced than modern scholars and “men of God“ who were blinded by the school of materialism and warped by its twin pillar, bigotry.

Most of these Masters, she claimed, lived in spa-like retreats in India, Tibet and Mongolia, and are members of a Brotherhood of Adept s. Pythagoras, the alchemists, the Freemasons and Rosicrucians are all exemplary Theosophists. All cl aimed to possess teachings that would assist in the purif ication of the human soul and the elevation of the soul from Earth. While HPB and her growing band of disciples were it s spokespersons, HPB believed the Masters Koot Hoomi (or Kuthumi), Lal Singh, and Morya (note this name) wer e the true founders of the Theosophical Society. Late in the spring of 1875, just before the TS was founded, HPB had a profound “psychophysiological” experience in which she was overshadowed by Master Morya, or Master M. They ‘mind-melded’. He began to speak through her. 21 El Morya is one of the assistants of the Manu whose work is primarily concerned with planetary politics , government and the founding and dissolution of race s. The Manu’s staff spends a great deal of time attempting to influence the minds of Earth’s statespeople and politicians... including Henry A. Wallace. ROOS Wallace’s Theosophical beliefs carried through to 1 943 when, as Vice President, he expressed his Jefferson ian commitment to the soil, and to agriculture as the b asis for all civilization. He wrote to an injured youth: “When the human spirit gets tired and large numbers of people drift into the cities, the soil is no longer taken care of, the families get smaller, and the population af ter a time"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 7 7 decreases. In the meantime the barbarians have lear ned much from the nation which formerly held the torch of civilization.

Obviously our problem is to get closer to the soil again whil e at the same time there is a renewal of some fundamental virtues .” The Earth-based Native American tradition most certainly would have appealed to Wallace’s spiritua l sensibilities. The Iowa region was once the home of prehistoric Indians who became known as Mound Build ers. They had disappeared long before white people first arrived in 1673. Interestingly, the Wallaces of Iowa came f rom the Welsh as demonstrated by the phonetic similarity of Welsh and Wallace, pronounced wallish or welish (Welsh). Were he to look, there is no telling what sort of artifa cts Wallace might have turned-over in his cornfields. As Wallace biographers Graham White and John Maze detail, 2 2 in the 1930’s Henry began exchanging correspondence with a Minnesota artist named Charle s Roos (pronounced rooz ) who offered to instruct him in a Native American spiritual teaching for creating rain. Coincidentally, Roos is the root of rooster , the bird of the morning, and Roosevelt , the man with whom Henry would later seek Christ and the Holy Grail. Charles announced a new dawning of Henry’s spiritual awaken ing (as only a roos, rooster, bird can do). In July 193 2, Roos wrote to Wallace reminding him to: “Step lightly in dealing with the Kings of the Four Winds ” (a term we shall encounter again shortly)."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 7 8 This method of prayer was in perfect harmony with Wallace’s Theosophical beliefs. In another letter t o Henry, Roos wrote what is a veritable permission slip enab ling him to appear to the rain god: “When HAW needs rain gre atly for personal gain, then I allow you to quietly addr ess the Lord of the Four Winds in the name of Ah Ning ( Roos ) and state and ask just when, where and amount needed. N ot for Iowa, but where rain will benefit Chief Cornplanter.” “ Cornplanter ” and “ Chief Standing Corn ” were two appellations given Wallace by Roos. Wallace apparently followed Roos’ instructions and was successful in calling down the rain. “You can n ot guess how glad I am that Rain Gods responded to HAW,” Roo s replied soon after sending his rainmaking instructi ons. “Tell me in detail how strong the kick-back or vibr ation or high-nervous-pitch was as soon as you actually cont acted the Great Rain Makers.” Like Benjamin Franklin pulling lightning out of the sky with a key, Roos is asking Wallace for the key or f requency of the Great Rain (rhein, rhythm, key) Makers. WALLACE AND THE IROQUOIS Wallace and Roos shared conversations about Native American traditions continued until the early 1930’ s. 23 Once, Roos dispatched Wallace to Syracuse, New York to see the Onondoga Indian tribal leaders.

Wallace had developed a fairl y provocative spiritual resume. His next great spirit ual adventure would include a search for Christ in Mong olia and the development of the A-bomb during an apocaly ptic battle with the forces of darkness. The extent of Wallace’s continued involvement in setting the world free of the Nazis through the aus pices of the A-bomb as Roosevelt’s Vice President centered a round his membership in F.D.R.’s hermetically tight inner circle of nuclear policy makers which came to be called th e Top Policy Group . 1 F.D.R. named its members: Wallace, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, Carnegie Institute’s Vannevar Bush and Ja mes B. Conant, the president of Harvard. Nothing concernin g the development of the A-bomb got out unless F.D.R. wan ted it. 2 From the very beginning, nuclear policy came from t he top down -- from the top of the political pyramid, that is.

As we will see, however, there may have been additional, more provocative, reasons for F.D.R.’s secretive and controlled approach towards the secrets of the atom. VANNEVAR BUSH One of Wallace’s closest allies in the Top Policy G roup was the architect of nuclear policy Vannevar Bush ( 1890- 1974); a man who was called the most politically po werful patriot and inventor in America since Benjamin Fran klin, and who is credited with the invention of the Inter net, 3 the modern ‘Thought Sphere’.

He had been offered the presidency of M IT, but his patriotic impulse called him to Washington where, with war approaching, he could be closer to the cen ter of action. Frederic Delano, the President’s influential uncle, introduced him to the Washington science establishm ent. Bush was present when the news of the German discov ery of fission was disclosed at the Carnegie sponsored conference in Washington in January 1939. He was"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 8 2 sickened by the ensuing public interest in the spli tting of the uranium nucleus and the possibility of a weapon of such mass destruction. He feared talk of the immense des tructive capacity of the atom was the “real danger,” and tha t a public panic greater than the one that in October 1 938 followed Orson Welles’ radio broadcast of a fiction al Martian landing in New Jersey was a possibility. In early May 1940 Bush asked Frederic Delano to arrange a meeting with the President at the White H ouse. 4 Delano was highly influential in the lives of both Bush and F.D.R. He is credited with guiding the growth of Washington D.C. and, like Bush, was deeply interest ed in Aztec and Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Peninsula. Their common interest in Mayan culture would have seemed like a connecting point. Strangely, however, when he assumed control of the Carnegie Institution Bush immediately discontinued Carnegie support for impor tant Mayan research. This slammed the door on Mayan studies in America. The official explanation is that Bush did not consi der Mayan studies core science.

Beyond radar, the most pressing issue on Bush’s agenda was the A-bomb. At first Bush was skeptical that an atomic bomb could be built and was against spending precious time and resources pursuing it. Bush was convinced that if Britain fell, America mi ght never reverse Nazi domination over Western Europe. For Bush the defense of the free world rested on weapon s that could be deployed not within a matter of years, but within a matter of months in time to have an impact on the o utcome of the current war. Standing along with the secretaries of Army and Nav y, Bush later said he felt “that primal joy that comes from an intense group effort in defense of his home,” as th ough he “stood at the mouth of a cave with a few strong men of the clan armed with stone axes against a hostile world.” 4 The man whom Bush most relied on at the cave’s entrance was Henry A.

This office replaced the NDRC, funded with t he president’s emergency funds, with a congressionally funded operation. Vannevar Bush was put in charge. He would report directly to F.D.R. Its prime directive was simple: create weapons to win the war. Another Top Policy Group member, James B. Conant, assumed the chairmanship of NDRC. In this way the nuclear secre ts"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 8 5 held by F.D.R. would be disseminated by and through Top Policy Group members. From the outset, Bush was apprehensive about the potential success of building the A-bomb. In June o f 1941 he began to change his tune. Three key pieces of ne w knowledge were the cause. First, calculations and conclusions by Britain’s to p scientists convinced him a fission weapon was possi ble (and that Britain was ahead of America in the devel opment of the bomb). Second, a memo from Enrico Fermi helped Bush see that the economics and engineering requirements of building the bomb were feasible. Third, Bush came to believe the possibility of a Na zi A- bomb was too great. His imagination ran wild with p ictures of a crazed Hitler enslaving the world with A-bombs . The U.S. had to get there first. On June 22, 1941, Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, its massive Blitzkrieg invasion of Russia that opened the Eastern Front and escalated the war. Hil ter planned to push all the way to the Urals and seize Russia’s industrial and agricultural base (and perhaps a few artifacts as well). Some Americans rejoiced at the sight of t he two totalitarian behemoths fighting each other. Senator Harry Truman expressed his hope that the Russians and Germans would kill each other off whil e America egged on whoever was on the bottom of the p ile. James B. Conant, one of F.D.R.’s Top Policy Group members, proposed that at the end of the war the Un ited States should impose a “Pax Americana” and carve Eu rope into a series of “small agricultural states.”"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 8 6 BUSH VISITS WALLACE’S BIRD HOUSE On June 29, 1941 Bush spent an evening with Wallace to discuss the A-bomb. In his diary Wallace wrote, “Bush says that it (the bomb) is his greatest headache. I n view of the German activity he must absolutely work on it, but at the same time it is one of the most dangerous jobs he has ever tackled.” 6 In a letter to F.D.R., Bush explained his conversio n concerning the bomb. He remained cautious, stating that he was concerned that public funds might be used for t he bomb, a project that might only be a wild goose cha se or a jump through a rabbit hole. On the other hand, he w rote, “there has appeared recently, new knowledge that ma kes it probable that the production of a superexplosive ma y not be as remote as previously appeared.” Bush and Wallace then traveled to Wallace’s chicken farm in Maryland on a Sunday afternoon to discuss a n all- out atomic program. Wallace later wrote that Bush “ wanted my judgment as to whether we should go full steam a head. We both realized the frightening aspects of unlocki ng the power of the atom and we both knew at that time of some of the struggles which would inevitably ensue, but we were certain that the attempt had to be made with all ou r energy because of the danger that the Germans would get th ere first .”7 Bush knew that Henry’s knowledge as a hybrid-corn inventor enabled him to understand the atom, certai nly as no other member of F.D.R.’s tight inner circle, and perhaps, if my speculation is correct, as few other men alive."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 8 7 THE MAUD REPORT In August 1941 America was primarily isolationist. The F.D.R. Administration was preparing for war. The co vert Top Policy Group members expressed their concern th at Germany, with its head start provided by its pionee ring fission research, might develop the A-bomb first. Having experienced the London Blitz James B. Conant was adamant that the Group proceed with plans for t he A- bomb. In his view if America entered the war it had to win it quickly and decisively. Bush expected the German s to be “close competitors” in development of the bomb. 8 By the fall of 1941 Conant became the first member of the Top Policy Group to call for the “unconditional surrender” of Nazi Germany as the basic U.S. war goal. On October 9, 1941 Wallace and Bush saw F.D.R. in the White House. Bush brought along a copy of the f inal version of Britain’s report on the feasibility of t he A-bomb, which he had received only days before. Titled the MAUD report, it concluded that the A-bomb could be ready for deployment by the end of 1943. Bush also brought al ong his concern about the Nazis program to build the bomb. With Thanksgiving approaching most Americans knew it was not a matter of if but how and when America would enter the war. Inside the Top Policy Group, members knew that the A-bomb was within their grasp. In early No vember, a third secret National Academy report on uranium “ not only radiated a more martial spirit on the matter o f a bomb.” Conant wrote, “but was much more specific on the matter of the bomb.” The report flatly stated that “within a"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 8 8 few years“ A-bombs using U-235 could be constructed that would “determine military superiority,” and it urge d immediate “development of this program.” 9 The Top Policy Group was not the only ones who knew this. According to Soviet intelligence files disclo sed after the war, Moscow also knew about it. In October 1941 , the forerunner of the KGB, the People’s Commissariat fo r Internal Affairs (NKVD), cabled from London with ne ws that British scientists had concluded that the A-bo mb was feasible by the end of the war. This would only be possible with America’s help and that F.D.R. had authorized intelligence swapping between British and American scientists. 10 CHURCHILL THE DRUID While many think of the development of the A-bomb a s strictly an American scientific affair, the truth i s the British were also working on atomic weaponry. One of my fundamental hypotheses is that the words of the participants involved in the building of A-bomb reveal the secret connection to the Grail. In this regard, the ruddy- cheeked Winston Churchill appears to have revealed the biggest secrets of them all. His shining moment cam e in September 1943. Churchill visited the United States after the Quebe c Conference in August. On August 19, 1943 Britain an d the U.S. agreed to “full and effective collaboration” o n development of “Tube Alloys,” the British code name for their atomic bomb project. 11"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 8 9 In this agreement the two allies pledged never to u se atomic weapons against one another, and would get e ach other’s permission before launching a nuclear strik e against a third party. The two sides formed the Combined Policy Committee , a combined, high-level Top Policy Group to supervise their joint development of the A-bomb. 12 After the Quebec conference Churchill was invited, secretly, to Harvard to receive an honorary doctor of law degree. During his stay in Boston Churchill brought up the subject of the “ Tube Alloys .” This name is nonsensical to historians. From the Grail point of view, however, Tube Alloys is an obvious anagram for “Tula Boys,” or Druids, ‘the men of the oak trees’, who came from Tula at the center of Hyperboria. Winston Churchill was a Tula Boy. He wa s inducted into the Albion Lodge of the Ancient Order of the Druids at Blenheim on August 15, 1908. 13 This ’secret society’ was devoted to the Druid religion of the H oly Grail. Historians deny Churchill’s Druid connection, sayi ng he participated for entertainment. However, his act ions reveal otherwise. The Druids were associated with the Mother Bird Goddess. The letter V was the symbol for the Bird Goddess, the Bird Language and Christ. Authentic representations of Christ based on the Shroud of Tu rin plainly show a V on Christ’s forehead. 14 This symbol has been found on shrines dating from 7,000 - 3,500 BC. Some claim the V represents a bird since it resembles a flock of birds in flight. Others say it likely represents th e “vessel” or “womb” of all life: the Grail."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 9 0 The V symbol was the trademark of Churchill.

W hen he stuck the V symbol in Hitler’s face was he broad casting in full volume to those ‘in the know’ that the secr ets of the Grail – long associated with Britain -- would help insure allied victory against the Nazis? During his speech, which he stayed up late into the night before to write, Churchill emphasized the “ti es of blood and history,” 15 of law, language, and literature linking Britain with the United States. He proposed a joint Anglo-American citizenship. In his History of the Island Nation , Churchill describes what he termed the sequential evolutionary phases o f the mutating English folksoul . He traced the mutating British folksoul from the empires of Greece, and Rome to America. And then Churchill dropped a large bird bomb at Harvard. With a twinkle in his eye Churchill expres sed his delight to return to “academic groves – groves is, I believe, the right word.” 16 Those ‘in the atomic know’ might have thought he wa s blatantly referring to General Leslie Groves, who w as recently put in charge of the Manhattan Project. Th ose ‘in the Druid know’ would appreciate that he was talkin g about the Druid’s oak grove and Tula. Churchill’s message was loud and clear. The Tula Boys were back in town.

Perhaps this is why the occult is outside of the ma instream scholar’s mental box, their paradigm. This does not mean we can wink or crinkle our nose and make the occult beliefs of the movers and shakers of WW II go away, which is what Churchill attempted to do after the War. At the Nuremburg trials of the Nazi war criminals, Churchill ordered the occult beliefs of the Nazis k ept secret for fear that the jury would not give the Nazis the death penalty on the grounds that they were insane. At th e close of WW II, the victorious Allies -- the United State s, Soviet Union, Britain and France -- captured Hermann Goeri ng and 20 other leading Nazis and set up the tribunal in the Palace of Justice at Nuremberg in southern Germany. Prosecutors accused them of shattering civilized standards by organizing or abetting atrocities and laying waste to Europe. At its heart Nuremberg helped lay the foundation for the principle that governments must be held accountable for mistreating their citizens. What wa s omitted was the explanation for why the Nazis did w hat they did. The reason, as Churchill delcared, is ide as are the true powers that turn the wheel of fortune of nations. The Allies feared that if word leaked of the spirit ual principles that guided the Nazis to such a fast ris e to power it might inspire imitators.

He preached that a “changing of the human heart” could transform the c ountry and even the entire world. He believed such a movem ent was at hand in 1940. As a possible vice-presidentia l candidate he was in a pivotal position to make this happen. Bankhead was furious at the selection of Wallace. Despite a soothing telephone call from F.D.R. he en tered the race for Vice President.

He was listening... but his eyes were way off. ...I remember thinking that his face and posture depicted the kin d of suffering that a man in the Middle Ages being tried for some heresy which he couldn’t understand might show . The storm was rolling over him and he had to take it.” 2 For Mrs. Wallace, recalled Perkins, the agony was e ven worse. She bore the face of the wife of a martyred mystic.

Seated before a phalanx of microphones, he t old the convention that he would do what no man had done in the 164 year history of America: he would seek a third term as President.

THE GURU LETTERS For Henry Wallace the campaign of 1940 was official ly launched when he delivered his nomination acceptanc e speech on August 29 in his hometown of Des Moines, Iowa.

Any opposition to F.D.R., declared Wallace, especially a vote for liberal bus inessman Wendell Wilkie, the Republican presidential candida te, was a “vote for Hitler.” As can be expected, Wallace’s vitriolic comments we re met with harsh Republican counter-attacks.

They left the letter s with two Wall Street attorneys, who later returned them to the Museum after declining to handle Roerich’s case. Mr s. Roerich made photostat copies of the letters and pa ssed them from person to person. This may have been the official end of Wallace’s subsidizing of Roerich’s political agenda, but it w as not the end of Wallace’s association with other former Roer ich “cult members,” as Pegler repeatedly referred to th em. In 1938 Wallace brought Roerich’s backer, Horch, into his inner circle when he appointed him to the position of Senior Marketing Specialist of the Department of Agriculture.

One of those New Dealers was Congressma n Sol Bloom, whose district included the lamasery. Bl oom was a former circus showman who periodically lived in an apartment at Roerich’s lamasery. 22 He became Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs. He once remarked to Pegler that if you were around Roerich long enough he would get to you. He never let Roerich look him in the eye, just like he never let a circus hypnotist look him in the eye. Henry Wallace was another story, according to Pegler. 23 In his view Roerich certainly did put the eye on Wallace. Then, to insure Roerich never came back to America to give him they eye again; the New Deal ga ve the Guru the Income Tax treatment, turning the Departme nt of Treasury loose on Roerich’s financial affairs. “A DISGRUNTLED, DISCHARGED EMPLOYEE” The sudden appearance of the “Guru letters” in 1940 called for dramatic action not just for Wallace’s s ake, but also for F.D.R.’s. The President feared the Republi cans would use his relationship with Roerich, as well as his own letters to his wife, against him. 24 At the time of the “Guru letter” meeting with Rosenman and Hopkins, Wallace was campaigning in Chicago.

For years he had urged the Secretary not to send them. In additi on to the Roerich letters, Appleby was aware that Wallace was corresponding with an Indian shaman or medicine man in New Mexico or Arizona. According to a letter written to Pegler on March 10 , 1948 by John J. O’Connor, 26 a New York lawyer, the first disclosure of Wallace’s involvement with Roerich di d not come from the Republicans, or from the “Guru letter s.” O’Connor declared that the New Deal high command kn ew all about their relationship before they nominated Wallace. Apart from F.D.R., those ‘in the know’ included Senator Robert F. Wagner, of New York, who was the Chairman of the Platform Committee at the Chicago Convention. By 1940, said O’Connor, it was common knowledge in the Roosevelt Administration that the President and Secretary of Agriculture were looking for Jesus in Mongolia. In fact, the “Guru letters” crisis was not going to go away easily in 1940. The White House learned that B lock sent his ace reporter Sprigle to question the seque stered big mouth Wallace.

In Chicago on October 19, 1940 Wallace unexpectedly appeared to Sprigle and asked him how to spell his name. He the n scrawled it across the top of a two-page statement written by Appleby. The letter, which has never been published, is the only public statement by Henry A.

THE CONCLUSION TO THE GURU LETTERS CRISIS Upon his return to Pittsburgh, Block informed Sprig le that the “Guru letter” story would be dropped. Repu blican National Committee leader Rep. Joseph W.

Historians say F.D.R. diffused the “Guru letter” cr isis by sending Harry Hopkins to see Wilkie and threaten ing to expose his affair. The Republicans dropped the “Gur u letters,” say historians, fearing the electorate wo uld view their use of the Wallace material as a smear campaign. This strikes me as a rather lame historical conject ure for the reason behind the conclusion to the 1940 “Guru letter” affair. Wallace had all but called the Republicans Nazis. It does not make sense to me that they would worry about being accused of negative campaigning by labe ling him a pagan or a fool for Christ. Nor does the Republican response reconcile with history. It was common knowledge at the highest levels of Washington’s grapevine that F.D.R.’s marriage to El eanor had been irrevocably damaged by her discovery that Franklin was having an affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918.

All the Republicans had to do was counter attack with F.D.R.’s affair. Perhaps wi th the possibility of American involvement in the war in E urope looming they were concerned about being perceived a s going too rough on F.D.R. However, this too does not reconcile with history. F.D.R. was despised by millions of Americans, many of whom would have cherished seeing his pompous reputa tion soiled by allegations of marital impropriety, and p referred his immediate eviction from office. For these reasons I believe there must have been so me other reason for dropping the matter. Looking at the letters with a fresh eye, as we will be doing, will provide a more plausible explanation fo r the temporary dropping of this matter. And I do mean temporary. The “Guru letters” were resurrected from their brie f sleep in 1948 when Wallace ran for President as the Progressive Party candidate. Publication of them de stroyed his political career. What is it about these “Guru letters” that makes th em of such interest 14 years after their first appearance , and now nearly 70 years later? Before we discuss the most relevant, and simultaneously shocking, of these letters, and post ulate why they are of so much interest, it is vital to drill to further depths of Henry A.

Borodine mentioned Roerich’s work with healing plants from Central Asia. Along with the so unds of the Corn Belt’s winds rustling through the leaves o f the tall golden Iowa corn Borodine’s words were music to Wallace’s ears. Wallace’s Native American and Theosophical interest s, coupled with his belief that “all great spiritual m ovements must have a life springing out of mother earth” 1 led him to look into Nicholas Roerich after Bordine’s suggesti on.

Wallace wrote thanking her for a co py of Roerich’s travel diary A l t a i - H i m a l a y a , which was published that year. In all his travels and searches Wallace was a man o n a hunt for symbols and connections to the ancient pas t. These ancient atomic symbols, as Theosophists Besant and Leadbeater will shortly demonstrate, lead one to co rn for the source of the secrets of light fusion. Perhaps young Henry had discovered a portion of these secrets in his corn splicing days in Iowa. Wallace, himself a natural artist, most certainly respected Roerich’s artistic ability. He writes: “I have read enough to know that it is what I hoped. Both in wor ds and in painting Roerich is an adept in the use of symbols, which have a power unknown to science . And yet Roerich’s mysticism has a decidedly practical aspect and eventually significance to the scientific world ” (italics mine). 2 He closed the letter by stating he hoped to visit t he Roerich museum in the middle of August. He was then on his way to a conference of European Agricultural Economists. He was elated, and honored, when he was invited to spend a ten minutes with the Professor. Wallace intended to visit Roerich the next time he was in N ew York. Late in 1929 Wallace called on Roerich. He was not able to meet the Guru then. Still, as Wallace recal led, the painter’s appearance, canvases and ambitious plans to promote peace and culture enamored him. He subscrib ed to Roerich’s magazine and his ideal of creating a fund amental unity of all religions, the brotherhood of man, and the need"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 17 for the spiritual transformation of the human heart to achieve cooperation among nations. In addition, Wallace recalled being “taken in” by Roerich’s exclusiveness. Much too late to take back his actions and words, he suspected that Roerich’s game of hide-and-seek was manipulation by the great, mystic al guru. He speculated the opinion that one way to make a ma n seem great is to keep him out of sight and get foll owers to say glowing things about him. 3 THE GURU Who was this elusive man of genius? Nicholas Constantine Roerich was born on October 9, 1874 to a wealthy family of St. Petersburg, Russia. His fathe r, Konstantine, was a lawyer. His mother, Marie, creat ed a warm, loving home. The Roerich family traced its li neage to the time of the Vikings. In Scandinavian Nichola s means “one who overcomes” Roerich means “rich in glory.” One of the Roerichs was head of the Knights Templar in the thirteenth century. 4 Like Henry Wallace, from his earliest years Nichola s exhibited a pronounced affinity for nature. He disc overed nature while summering at the Roerich’s country est ate, Isvara, near St. Petersburg. Nicholas’s father had purchased Isvara from a former aid to Catherine the Great who named the estate after travelling in India. Isvara means “Lord” or “divine spirit.”"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 18 Nicholas Roerich as young man."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 19 Young master Roerich was mesmerized by a painting of the sacred Himalayan peak Kanchenjunga.

He is credited with over 7, 000 paintings and set designs. In addition to painting, Roerich had a passionate interest in human history. He believed that the way to create a better future was through understanding th e past (a Theosophical concept). He led archaeological explor ations of ancient Russian burial mounds, including those i n the vicinity of Isvara. The results of these expedition s contributed significantly to the understanding of t he early history of man in Russia and Central Asia. Under the direction of ancient Russian scholar and painter Vicktor Vasnetov, and later, Vladimir Staso v, an eminent Russian historian and art critic, Roerich s tudied ancient Russian folk tales and the lives of Russian saints. He felt a strong natural affinity for Germanic and Nordic legends. Roerich came to believe that there were strong ties between the ancient Slavic Russian culture and the Aryans of Iran and India. In 860 AD the Russian nation was founded by the Nordic Prince Rurik (an ancient form of Roerich, phonetically ‘rurik’), the leader of the N ordic nation of Rus (pronounced Roos ). 5 After the Rus arrived in their great Viking ships, the land became known as Rus, or Russia .

In some traditions the center of Atum is described as a flower, or lotus, with 64 petals. The lotus later became the rose, the symbol of Jesus, in the Christian tradition. 7 Before the time of Jesus, however, the bridge or interface between the earthly world and the inner w orld of Atum was the Egyptian hieroglyphic called Ru , drawn in a sacred geometrical shape called the vesica piscis by the first Gnostic Christians. 8 It is called simply “the Fish.” According to the Py ramid Texts, the heron or phoenix is another form of A-tum. The Egyptian hieroglyph for the heron, the bird of Tula, is the same as the fish hieroglyph later adopted by Christians to represent Christ, the fish-bird-man.

ENTER THE CZAR In 1899, at twenty-four, Nicholas Constantine Roeri ch was named professor of archaeology at the Imperial Institute of St. Petersburg. 9 That summer the Russian Archaeological Society sent him to study ancient architecture.

In January 1904 Roerich’s career received a huge boost when Czar Nicholas II expressed the desire to acquire his entire series of over seventy Russian architect ural studies for the Russian Museum. Unfortunately, Nich olas did so on the same day Russia declared war on Japan. The sale was never completed. Instead, Roerich’s en tire exhibition, as well as several paintings, were sent to the United States as part of the Russian exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. This began a long ordeal during which Roerich lost complete control of his p aintings and resulted in the paintings not being returned to Russian until 1976. To support his young wife Nicholas applied for and was hired as a president of the prestigious Society for Encouragement of Fine Arts and the St. Petersburg W orld of Art Society. 11 He continued to paint and explore his archaeological studies. Many of his paintings revea l the Theosophical belief held by Henry Wallace that industrialization was robbing humanity of its conne ction to nature, and therefore, God. In Roerich’s view the Stone Age, when humankind and nature were in harmony, was humankind’s Golden Age. 12 Where Wallace saw each human life as a divine spark from a great Fire, Roerich painted man as a tiny speck i n a great mysterious landscape in which the sky is enormous a nd all- powerful, and the Earth stretches eternally into space.

ROERICH AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIRDS Throughout his life Roerich was interested in the ancient history of his ancestors, the Rus, or the W ise Ones. Together with Helena he studied the great Indian ep ics, such as the Bhagavad Gita , and the profound works of Indian philosophy and ancient science. Roerich came to believe the link between Russia and India was to be established by examining the ancien t art and customs of the East and showing the identical a rt and customs in Russia. 13 It is in the midst of the collision of these two understandings that we now live as member s of the Atom’s family. The Indian influence on Roerich’s life is easily se en in a fairy tale based on the Indian legend of Devassari Abuntu he wrote in 1905. In the tale a woman follows the t eaching of Buddha and leaves organized society to live amon g the birds . She learns the language of the birds , and they protect her from harm and prevent her from aging (a story e lement also found in the tale of the Birds of Rhiannon who se song was so sweet they could eliminate fear and stop agi ng). The birds tell her that it is her time to die and send her off in search of the stone of death. In the desert she dis covers a group of dark stones. She asks them to accept her b ody.

THE FLOWERS OF MORYA With his understanding of the Bird language, Roeric h began a quest to synthesize the philosophies and re ligious teachings of all the ages. Like many Druid Peacemak ers or bards before him, including King Solomon, Roerich p ut these nuclear teachings in verse. In 1916 he began to formulate The Flowers of Morya a collection of sixty-four poems in blank verse. Morya or Mariah was the site of Solomon’s Temple.

THE REVOLUTION Not long after Roerich began The Flowers of Morya , along came the Russian Revolution of 1917 and World War I. For hundreds of years, czars (emperors) and empr esses ruled Russia. Opposition to the czars’ absolute pow er increased during the late 1800’s and the early 1900 ’s. Revolutionaries overthrew the Romanov monarchy in 1917. The next year, Russia became the Russian Sovi et Federative Socialist Republic (R.S.F.S.R.). The writer Maxim Gorky, then the czar of art and agriculture under the new Soviet government, made Roerich chairman of the Council of Art Affairs. Roe rich could not escape his angst over the actions of the new Bolshevik regime through either painting or archaeo logy, and in 1919, after only two months as chairman, he fled Russia with his family to London. He now classified himself as a White Russian, and published a pamphle t in which he denounced the Bolsheviks as criminals. 17 In 1922, the R.S.F.S.R. and three other republics rearranged the letters of their name and establishe d a new nation called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republi cs (U.S.S.R.), also known as the Soviet Union.

Roerich was transfixed by the wa y in which the tribal customs of the peoples of the Amer ican Southwest so closely matched those of the Slavs, an d how much they looked like the Asian people of Mongolia. 19 This should not have surprised Roerich. The Hopi Indians of Arizona trace their ancestry to the Maya , who claimed their ancestors were bearded white men who came from Mongolia beside the river Tula. They sailed th e world naming places after their homeland. 20 In 1923 Roerich painted an amazing canvas called The Miracle , in which a brilliant ball of light emerges from t he Grand Canyon.

Historians wonder how a cautious and conservative New York broker such as Horch could have been so de eply influenced by Roerich. One answer is Horch’s wife N ettie, who believed Roerich was the recipient of divine Theosophical knowledge. As enrollment increased, key roles were filled by Nettie’s friend, a music critic named Francis Grant , and exiled Russian pianist Maurice Lichtmann and his wi fe Sina, both of whom taught piano lessons. Grant late r became the go-between for Wallace and Roerich. CROWN OF THE WORLD Fueled by a desire to unite the world through art, on July 11, 1922, Roerich established the Corona Mundi , Inc. (Crown of the World), an international art center i n an apartment building owned by Horch in New York at 31 0 Riverside Drive (site of the present Roerich Museum ). Its prime directive was to teach the universal language : art. He began a series of exhibits featuring artists and th eir symbols from Italy, Russia, Tibet, America, Australia and B razil, along with the finest contemporary art of India, Fr ance, Germany, and South America. By 1923 Roerich had achieved what many consider to be the American dream. He had a loving, intelligent and beautiful wife. He ran his own flourishing empire. His son, George, was accepted to Harvard. Svetoslav, his you nger son, enrolled at Colombia University to study archi tecture. To top it off, the Roerich Museum was founded as a tribute"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 36 to him. He could have stayed in New York and basked in this dream. But that was not meant to be. Roerich dreamed of India and finding the missing in ner secrets of Buddhism and Theosophy so that he could cause East and West to collide. He planned a trip to cons ult with the holy men of the Himalayas to inquire about the lost teachings of the ages and the whereabouts of any dw elling places of the masters of the East. In May of 1923, loaded up with over $300,000 in contributions from Horch and his wealthy art-loving friends, the Roerichs departed New York for a two-y ear expedition to India. In exchange for its backing Ro erich gave the Master Institute and Corona Mundi exclusiv e right to his paintings and drawings that resulted from th e expedition. His supporter, Louis Horch, was given power of attorney over all his financial affairs (a move tha t would come back to haunt the painter when Horch filed sui t against him in 1935). 24 Roerich’s artistic output was phenomenal. During th e five-year expedition he journeyed through much of I ndia and Central Asia, painting over 500 paintings along the way. All but a few were acquired on behalf of the R oerich Museum by Louis Horch. With Roerich’s artistic output showing no signs of slowing down, the museum was soon outgrown. Roerich ’s followers, including Horch, built a magnificent $2, 900,000 29-story lamasery in honor of Roerich at 310 Rivers ide Drive and 103 Street in New York City.

ROERICH IN INDIA In April 1930 Roerich sought to return to India to purchase land in Naggar where he intended to set up a scientific and cultural station. 25 But the British government intervened, denying him a visa. During his 1924-192 5 visit to India Roerich made several attempts to return to Russia. He finally reached Moscow in 1926, and was quite fr iendly to the revolutionary Soviet regime. He talked of hi s conversations with Indian mahatmas who were interes ted in an anti-British alliance of Leninsim and Buddhism t hat could overthrow British rule in India. The Soviets were less than enthusiastic in their belief in this premise. Naturally, the British were not eager to assist Roe rich. Horch called his contacts at the State Department f or help on behalf of his friend Nick Roerich with the Briti sh government. Roerich had already been investigated b y the State Department, which was interested in Roerich’s Russian connections and activities.

A negative report was returned. On the basis of these negative reports the State Departmen t concluded that the question of whether to give Roer ich a visa to return to India was up to the British. In a strange about face, on December 1930 the Briti sh allowed Roerich to proceed with his travel and rese arch plans in India. The Urusvati, Himalayan Research In stitute was established at Naggar the following year. 26 The primary work of the Institute was the translati ng of Asian texts and research into Tibetan pharmacopoeia or healing plants. A biochemistry laboratory was opene d in the Institute to find herbal cures for cancer. This work was assisted by Roerich’s sons who had trained in these fields at Colombia, Harvard and the Sorbonne in Paris. It was these healing herbs that captivated the atte ntion of Henry Wallace. On January 20, 1931 Wallace wrote France Grant to tell her that he had received a cop y of the inaugural issue of the Roerich Museum Bulletin and was enthralled with a poem by Roerich. He wrote: “If sometime you should publish a statement from Dr . Koelz (one of Roerich’s staff botanists at Naggar) concerning the medicinal uses of these different Hi malayan plants, I would appreciate having a copy. Sometime when you are writing to Dr. Koelz, I would appreciate it , if you could ask him to send you fifteen or twenty kernels of maize as grown in Kulu (the valley at Naggar).” 27 I am not certain what Henry expected to find in the corn in India, but, as we shall shortly see, given his Theosophical knowledge, something truly astonishing is possible."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 41 CHAPTER EIGHT THE SACRED STONE OF GOD Roerich’s New York museum/lamasery was dedicated October 17, 1929, twelve days before the big Wall S t. panic broke. Roerich returned to New York to speak at the dedication but failed to thank the architects, buil ders, or contributors who made it possible. Sina Lichtmann, one of Roerich’s disciples, claimed she saw Wallace enter the lamasery several times that day “with his collar tu rned up.” She believed Wallace was trying to escape attention. 1 The Roerich Museum Press issued a memorial of the cornerstone ceremony. It included a letter from New York Senator Robert F. Wagner, who said: “I know of no m ore restful place than the quiet rooms of the Roerich M useum to which Nicholas Roerich has brought the Oriental atmosphere captured in the distant East.” Then the Senator made a strange comment that is mos t fascinating when read in light of our previous inve stigation: “The old building was a little retreat known only t o those who knew their New York.” 2 Though it is claimed Wallace and Roerich met only once, from the first they enjoyed a mystic tie with Roerich in the role of guru.

Or, perhaps their unique shared intellectual training brought them together, as I have proposed. Roerich regaled Wallace with fanciful tales of repositories of occult knowledge hidden in otherwor ldly Shambhala (from Sabala ) in Mongolia. Geographically, Roerich spoke of Shambhala as a place near where Ch ina, Russia and Mongolia meet. Spiritually, Sabala was t he meeting hole between Heaven and Earth, and the dwel ling place of the gods on Earth. (We have already encoun tered it as the alternative name for the Cabala or Sabala.) Roerich claimed he had once gained possession of a sacred stone from another world. 3 The (s)tone, the Chintamani Stone, had been hidden in a pillar or to wer in Shambhala (or Sabala), broadcasting rays (vibration s, tones, frequencies) that influenced the destiny of the world. In 1921 Roerich acquired possession of this (s)tone to aid in the formation of the failed League of Nation s. He returned the (s)tone to Tibet in 1927. ISSA Among Roerich’s alluring tales of lost secret teach ings were those of Jesus. The Guru vividly traced what h e claimed were the lost silent years of Jesus between the ages of 15 and 30. In his book The Heart of Asia he refers to manuscripts and legends about Christ in various parts of Asia.

They say the Blessed Issa or “the Great Traveler,” as Jesus was called by the Buddhists, was fourteen whe n he arrived in present-day southeast Pakistan in the lo wer Indus River Valley and gained wide fame for his wisdom am ong the Aryans. 4 Leaving there Jesus studied for four years in the Jaganath Temple in Orissa where he was instructed b y a group of Secret Sages who taught him to read and understand the Vedas (scriptures of the Hindus whic h are strikingly similar to the Nordic Eddas) and to teac h, heal and perform exorcisms. 5 During the course of his travels Issa was known to have met with many Eastern holy men praying, meditating, practicing yoga, teaching, gathering notes, and see king and attaining adeptship over the elements and elemental forces of the universe. 6 The Yoga scriptures refer to eight great psychic or magic powers, the ashta-siddhis , as abilities these Hindu and Buddhist masters would have taught Jesus. These eight abilities are: 1. Animan, the ability to make oneself infinitely small in an instant; 2. Mahiman , the power to grow infinitely large at will; 3.

Ishitritva , the ability to create or destroy matter; 8. Kamavasayitva , instant materialization of wishes. 7 The Sanskrit term siddhi (pronounced ‘shee’) carries the meanings ‘attainment’, ‘accomplishment’, or ‘perfection’. 35 In the Hindu literature this term is used to denote the abilities which self-realized or spiritu ally perfected individuals possess and use unselfishly. As an adept these abilities would likely have accru ed to Issa as a by-product of his enlightenment. Masterin g them enables the initiate to ascend the evolutionary lad der, become a god-like being, homo angelis or Homo Christos , and enter Paradise. For these reasons this mutation is a heresy According to the texts and legends, Jesus became embroiled in a conflict when he denounced the hypoc risy of the priestly caste and began teaching secret hol y doctrines and a message of love and universal broth erhood to commoners. The priestly and warrior caste plotted to put Issa to death, just as would later happen in Palestine. Onl y this time Issa fled, literally narrowly escaping death.

He acted as Roerich’s guardian angel te nding to the tedious international diplomatic details of the U.S. government-funded search for Christ in Mongolia. In addition, in March 1933, after committing the U. S. government to the search for Christ, Wallace began actively campaigning the government to participate in the Roerich Peace Pact and Banner of Peace. Roerich wro te this treaty with the assistance of international le gal experts. Many world leaders and prominent persons such as Al bert Einstein and H.G. Wells endorsed it. 8 The Pact itself declared the necessity for protecti on of the sacred activity of the world -- both during war and peace -- and prescribed the method by which all sit es of cultural value would be declared neutral and protected. Just as the humanitarian purpose of the Red Cross i s embodied in a protective sign and banner, Roerich d esigned a symbol for the Banner of Peace: three red circles in a larger red circle on a white background. This disti nctive Banner of Peace, flown at all sites of cultural act ivity and historical value, would declare them neutral, indep endent of combatant forces.

In 1948 Pegler wrote a column in which he said he discovered that in 1936, Raoul E. Desvernine, a New York lawyer and student of the New Deal’s secret motives . 10 Desvernine wrote a book called Democratic Despotism in which he discussed Wallace’s interest in symbolism. This book was published four years before the “Guru lett ers” crisis. It contained a page of symbols. These were the symbols of fascism (the bundle of sticks), National Socialism (the swastika), Communism (the hammer and sickle) and the Roerich symbol. The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace movement, which Pegler called the “greatest publicity hoax in the history of the White House,” 11 grew rapidly during the early 1930’s, with centers in a number of countries and the Peace flag flying over numerous sacred sites. There were three international conferences, the first in Bruge s, Belgium, and the second in Montevideo, Uruguay. At the Third International Roerich Peace Banner Convention in Washington D.C. in 1933, Frances Gran t gave a speech which directly connected the Peace Pa ct with Shambhala: “The East has said that when the Banner of Shambhala would encircle the world, verily the New Dawn would follow.

The Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Plant Industry was sponsoring the expedition. Knowles A. Ryerson, chief of the Bureau of Plant Industry, had proposed a number of qualified plant scientists to lead the mission. But Wallace, with F.D.R.’s approval, gave the job to Roerich. Wallace believed that the Guru’s extensive travels and experience in Asia, coupled with his fame in Japan, China and Russia, made him the appropriate choice. As we know, however, there were other reasons for his selection of the painter to lead this expedition. Planning of this extraordinary mission began in 193 3. By Wallace’s recollection, given in his oral histor y interviews, F.D.R. was the one who suggested that Nicholas Roerich lead the mission. 1 Wallace remembers F.D.R.’s brainstorm as occurring in December, 1933. However, four months before, on Aug ust 2, 1933, he wrote to W.H. Woodin, secretary of the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 53 treasury, on behalf of Frances Grant, vice-presiden t of the Roerich Museum. This letter put the ball in motion for an expedition to northern India and southern Tibet in search of drug plants. Woodin requested that Grant outline the potential benefits of such plants, a plan of research, and ba ckground material about the Himalayan Research Institute and the Nicholas Roerich Museum. By August, Wallace opened the door of Jesse Jones, chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, on behalf of Grant and Louis Horch. He wrote a letter to Jones, saying that the Roerich Museum was a “cultural institution in which I have long been interested. I do not know if there is any way that your organization can be of help to the museum, but, in any event, I would appreciate greatly the courtesy whic h you might extend Miss Grant. Perhaps put her in touch w ith the right people to handle her problem.” 2 On September 1, 1933 Wallace wrote a tantallizing letter to the Roerichs. “Dear Madam and Professor Roerich, I address you as one because in a certain sense I look on you as one.

The true pleasure in times like these is to turn occasionally to the consideration of the search as conducted by such as Appolonius , Origen and Akbar. This steadfast search, this throwing of the light ahead, this prep aration for World Cultural Unity will make it possible for the human spirit to explore and appreciate the most undreamed of beauty. It is the opportunity for such appreciation by the deserving ones of the multitude that we are strivin g to purchase with our efforts. We hope to see you in this country but also against the backgroung of the snowy peaks. Work to do and Bliss to contemplate.” 4 Wallace’s reference to Applolinius is worth noting. Appolonius of Tyana was born in 16 AD in Cappadocia (present day Turkey). He claimed to have discovered a crystalline object embossed with the Emerald Tablet . He gained a reputation as a great healer and holy man teaching the principles of the Grail throughout the Greek world. 5 Henry Wallace had reason to believe that the Treasu ry Department would fund the expedition to Mongolia. H e went forward with plans, writing to F.D.R. on Decem ber 3, 1933 and reiterating their common knowledge about t he grasses of Tibet and Mongolia. In this letter he al so pointed out that “the political situation in this part of t he world is always rendered especially intriguing by the effect on it of ancient prophecies, traditions, and the like .”"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 56 Nick Roerich, said Wallace, was the man most “in th e know” concerning these prophecies.

Stevens, and that Knowles Ryerson, head of the bureau, would have ove rall jurisdiction, based in Washington. 6 On March 16, 1934, the Secretary of Agriculture wro te the mystic painter, asking him to “lead and protect the botanical research group organzied by the United St ates Department of Agriculture to search for drought res istant grasses in the central Asian field.” Wallace did not notify the Department of Agricultur e of his invitation. Nor, more importantly, did he infor m the Department of State, who surely would have objected to Roerich’s appointment. At the time Mongolia was an independent Communist state under Soviet protection . The explorers would be traveling in a region of immense political uncertainty.

On March 20, 1934, Roerich wrote a letter of acceptance to Wallace: Dear Mr. Secretary, I have received your letter of March 16 th , in which you invite me, on behalf of the Department of Agricultu re, to act as leader and protector of the botanical expedi tion organized by the United States Department of Agricu lture"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 57 to search for drought resistant grasses in the cent ral Asian field.

Neither Wallace nor the Roerichs’ wanted Macmillan and Stevens to get near enough to Roerich to learn what the Guru was doing in Wallace’s name. In fact, Roerich avoided contact with them at every juncture. In one of the “Guru letters” there was a mysterious reference con cerning the destination of the expedition. Wallace wrote: “Dear M, I am worried about the attitude of W and many other s concerning the rulers. Under their analysis the mat ter would come to a forcible climax perhaps in cooperat ion with the monkeys about two years hence. So far I have listened quietly.

The State Department had a long recor d on Roerich. If consulted it would have rejected him as a representative of the United States in any foreign land, let alone one in a sensative political area. When word came that Wallace gave him his blessing, the State Department notified several of its men in Asia not to officially recognize the Guru because he was not an American and America did not guarantee his intentio ns. The Roerichs were White Russians who carried French passports. Wallace stood behind his Guru, expressin g confidence that he would handle his official call o n the Imperial Minister of Manchukuo with ease. To insure his success, and to protect the botanists from physical danger, Wallace asked George Roerich to “ask the Guru to us e his powers to give them confidence and joy” so that the y would return home “singing his praises.” 14 In May 1934 the Roerichs arrived in Tokyo where the y stirred up a lot of publicitiy. After a highly publ icized meeting with the Japanese Minister of War Senjuro Hayashi, the Guru publicly proclaimed him a “great man.” 15 Macmillan and Stevens had planned to rendezvous wit h the Roerichs in Tokyo. The Roerichs had other plans , departing without them for Manchukuo on May 23, 193 4, with visas from the Manchukuoan Minister.

Unfazed by the diplomatic furor surrounding them, t hey whirled into Manchukuo in Manchuria, where they presented Emperor Pu Yi of Manchukuo with “the insi gnia of the First Class of the Roerich Museum,” plus the Banner of Peace logo. All of this was done in formal recog nition of the United States Department of Agriculture of “Pu Yi’s resplendent merits in the field of culture.” 18 When Macmillan and Stevens finally caught up with the Roerichs in the city of Harbin, where Roerich’s brother and thousands of other White Russians had taken ref uge, a circus-like atmosphere surrounded the Guru’s party. Roerich’s company included an escort of White Russi ans in Cossack uniform. A hastily prepared handbill glorified Roerich and s tated the guru’s support for the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and the ascendency of Japanese culture. 1 9 Macmillan sent a copy of this back to his superior in Washington with a note comparing the self-promotion al circular to an advertisement for “a circus or a cha in grocery store.” “The English language,” wrote Macmillan, “i s but a fumbling medium for what the professor wanted to sa y about himself.” 20"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 63 By August, 1934 the relationship between Roerich an d the botanists had grown confrontational. The botani sts simply could not understand why Roerich seemed tota lly uninterested in doing the proposed work concerning grasses. Roerich’s controlling nature emerged full- force, dictating the schedule of the expedition. He sent letters to Wallace complaining of the insubordinate botanists who failed to follow his instructions. He appealed to Wallace for additional authority. Wallace also had to intervene when the Government Accounting Office refused to pay Roerich for his clothing expenses. Most delicate of all was Wallace’s intervention whe n the hostile local Japanese newspapers in Harbin beg an attacking the Russian guru. Articles painting Roeri ch as an anti-Communist and anti-Fascist Freemason and Buddh ist who was trying to establish a separate state in Siberia began to surface. Roerich wrote to Frances Grant saying, “We are battling with the dark forces but as always are mov ing valiantly ahead.” Wallace’s support for the Guru was rock solid. In September, 1934, Wallace sent a telegram to MacMill an and Stephens ordering them to return immediately to the United States. He wrote another message to Roerich, saying, “Regret exceedingly insubordination MacMill an stop am recalling him and Stephens.” Wallace also wrote to the American consul general a t Hailor citing the botanists for insubordination and failure to perform the duties of the expedition. 21 He then wrote to Knowles Ryerson, head of the Bureau of Plant Indust ry, scolding him for siding with his employees: “The ru mors"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 64 which you mentioned concerning Professor Roerich ar e not only ridiculous but extremely malicious, and indica te ignorance of his outstanding achievements for the l ast forty years.” 22 After exchanging letters with Frances Grant at the Roerich Museum on the subject, Ryerson was demoted and transferred to the Division of Subtropical Horticulture. 23 With the botanists steaming home, Roerich was free to carry out his mission unobstructed. Wallace came to the Guru’s support, writing on September 27 expressing his “regret and indignation at the insubordination of t hese two members of the expedition.” In the same letter he apologized for the behavior of the botonists and as sured Roerich of his “complete confidence and aproval” in all the Guru’s forthcoming activities. The Secretary of Agriculture stated his personal be lief that the Guru’s mission would “help decidedly in ma king eventually possible greater human happiness in the western plains area.” 24 On October 1, 1934 Nicholas and George filed a repo rt to the President and the Secretary of Agriculture o n the scientific activities of the expedition. The focus of this report was the drama surrounding the insubordinatio n of the two botanists.

The Secretary of Agriculture promptly cleared the way with the War Department. Roerich was now roamin g Mongolia with four armed White Russian guards. 25 During the winter months of 1934 and 1935 Roerich promoted his Peace Pact as well as other issues. He made numerous speeches in North China and wrote of his d ream of “Kansas.” In 1935 the American minister in Peipi ng, Nelson Trusler Johnson, filed a report telling of t he Guru's conversations with prominent Mongolian politicians. Roerich promised the Mongolians that wealthy Americ ans would invest in Mongolian businesses. 26 This activity reveals a new dimension to the Roerich expedition. In January 1935, Wallace wrote another coded letter to Frances Grant concerning these extracirricular acti vities. This letter suggested presenting the idea of streng thening the “Kansas” (Mongolian) regime to F.D.R. by buying large amounts of silver from Mongolia and construct ing factories operated by cheap labor.

This whole approach is based on the assumption that the 9 named one has a deep mystical strain. If I have miscalculated naught will come of it.” 28 Naught did come of this business relationship. The plan to assist the Mongolian government failed. As Winter turned to the Spring of 1935 Roerich continued his political maneuvering, all the while boasting of his American diplomatic protection and ties to F .D.R. and Wallace. On June 24 the New York Times ran an article claiming that the Roerich peace party was engaged i n activities that were embarrassing the U.S. government. In August 1935 the Soviet Union began to express concern to the American representatives in Moscow. Wallace received a report from the State Department that shocked him. Reliable sources claimed Roerich was h eaded for the Soviet Union in hopes of stirring up former White Russian and discontented Mongolian elements. By September 1935, it was clear that the official Mongolian mission had failed. The Roerich expeditio n to Mongolia did not yield a single drought-resistant g rass. The majority of the plant specimens brought back to Washington were “curative herbs.” As Wallace later wrote, it was also becoming clear to Wallace that Roerich “was"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 67 not such a great man after all.” All he wanted to d o was get the self-promoting messiah back to Nagar, India, ge t his credentials, and wash his hands of him completely. 29 On September 4 Wallace cabled George Roerich warning that any publication of any information con cerning the Mongolian expedition without written approval f rom Henry Wallace was prohibited. September 16, Wallace cabled Roerich orders to return to Nagar, prepare a final report and to surrender his diplomatic papers. On September 21 the Department of Agriculture terminated the search for drought-resistant grasses in Mongolia. Wallace wrote to the Roerichs saying: “I desire that there be no communication, direct or indirect, by letter or otherwise between the Roerichs (father, mother, and son) on the one side and myself on the other. Official b usiness will be transacted with Frederick D. Richey, Chief, Bureau of Plant Industry.” The Secretary of Agriculture was attempting to clos e the door on Roerich. A telegram sent September 23 t o the Roerichs, signed by Richey, said: “We ask that ther e be no publicity whatever about recent expedition. There m ust be no quoting of correspondence or other violation of Departmetn publicity regulations.” 30 Unfortuately, for Wallace it was too late. The Guru letters had long since been written. In an attempt at damage control, Wallace wrote to Louis Horch a year later at the Roerich Museum, informing him that he had fired Roe rich and terminated his relationship with the Roerich fa mily.

Pegler was frustrated that newspapers, other than t hose who printed his column, ignored the F.D.R.-Wallace- Roerich story as if it did not exist, “as if there was no proof of such a plot afoot.” 2 At the same time he noticed that these newspapers thoroughly covered Wallace’s campaign speeches and printed the opinions of those who claimed Wallace w as honest, kind and brave. If he is so honest, wrote P egler, “why doesn’t he tell us what his relationship was w ith Roerich? If he is so brave why doesn’t he show the courage of his religious convictions and expound them to us , instead of babbling a camouflage routine about peace, as th ough everyone against him wanted war?” Pegler was out to present the occult story of the N ew Deal.

Pegler’s primary goal was to force Wallace to expla in his association with Roerich and accept the politic al consequences of his silly gullibility. 7 He had Wallace dead to rights on U.S. taxpayers sponsoring the Russian Roerich’s expedition to Mongolia. It was impossible for Wallace to deny his involveme nt. Records of the Departments of State and Agriculture , of the New York Supreme Court and of the Internal Revenue would make a liar of him.

Once we view this letter in light of Grail symbolism in which it was rendered its meaning is crystal clear. The Stone sought by W allace is the Holy Grail: the Stone of Oneness that reveals t he secret of the transmutation of matter. The Grail, also known as the Stone of God, I believ e, is the stone referred to by Jesus in The Gospel of Thomas when he said, “Split the wood, lift the stone, ther e I am.” Esoterically the ‘wood’ is the ‘life force energy’ upon which the world is built. If we make this small adjustment from wood worker t o Word worker Jesus what difference would it make? I propose it would begin to align us with the skilled word worker Jesus who matches Dead Sea Scroll scholar Ge za Verme’s ‘carpenter’ ( naggar in Hebrew) which, he says, stands for ‘scholar’ in certain Talmudic sayings. 9 It would also put us in touch with the living Jesus whose core of inner a-tomic secrets are found in The Gospel of Thomas , or what I’ll term The Gospel of A-tom . This Jesus might explain that naggar is the same as the Sanskrit word naga(s) , meaning, “evolved serpent of wisdom.” 10 Because Ak or Aki means light, 11 the two terms nagas and aki together, as in Nagasaki, could be interpreted as the “light of the evolved serpent of wisdom.” In Jesus’ time the word serpent meant something different than it does today.

Psalm 80:9 says God’s chosen people -- the bloodlin e of Jesus -- were the vine : “A vine thou didst bring out of Egypt.” Egyptian myth and religion centers on Isis and Osiris.

Like Christ he absorbed the attributes of many of the na tive gods of death and resurrection. Like Christ he was called the King of Terror. 1 In Egyptian religion, the Osiris and his wife, Isis, o r Aset (Isisbeing the Greek version of Aset, meaning a thr one or pillar ) 2 came to Earth from the Sba star -- Venus (the brightest star in the sky, in Canis Major and the p ossible"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 1 85 root or O-Siris). 3 They were cosmic missionaries -- heralded by a group of healer/scientists led by Tho th 4 -- who came to aid in the development of humankind, travelling throughout the world and uplifting human ity through the teaching of agriculture, music and the arts. Nicholas Roerich tracked the origins of Hindu-Buddh ist mythology. He believed this wisdom tradition emanat ed from a group of beings called the Blessed Ones who came to Earth from the constellation Orion, “Dwelling of the Gods.” 5 These extraterrestrial, or interdimensional, being s were called the Ousir , the root of Osiris. They lived in the nine-storied Mount Meru , which was located in Mongolia - - and live there still. Meru provides a vital link in our story. Scholars h ave had difficulty saying exactly where the original Me ru was located. 6 Meru’s Buddhist name, ‘sumeru’, obviously rings of Shumer , Sumer or Sumeria in present day Iraq.

It is the root of sabbatu , Sa-bat (‘Heart-Rest’), or Sabbath , the holy day of ‘rest’ or peace. Saabda means the Word in Sanskrit. ‘Sa’ is the Egyptian word for the holy blood of Isis. 12 It comes from the Egyptian Sba , or Saba, meaning ‘wise blood’, and is said to contain the ‘s pirit of all intelligence’. 13 Me-ru was the Mesopotamian home of the Sebittu (or Sa-Ba-Tu), the Sumerian name for a group of seven w ise Anunnaki, who like the Saba, were also seven in num ber. 14 At the center of the Sumerian legend of the Anunnak i is the god-being E.A., “the Lord of the Waters,” who taugh t gardening and wore “ a veil in his headband ,” and whose “body is a sun fish full of stars.” It may be said that E.A. was the first Rus.

The elements have definite sh apes. Much of chemistry work depends on being able to determine these shapes. Leadbeater and Besant used a method of “clairvoyant microscopy” or “psychic seei ng” to open a window through which to peer into the workin gs of nature and to see these shapes. This ability is among the eight sidhis reportedly l earned by adepts in India, including Jesus. The Yoga who l earned animan, has the ability to make oneself infinitely small a t will. This does not mean that he shrinks in bodily size, but only that, relatively , his conception of himself can be so minimized that objects, which normally are small, appear to him as large. This is the ability reputedly possessed by the Phar aohs as indicated by the Rus filament projecting from th eir uraeus headdress. When Leadbeater and Besant observed a chemical a~tom it appeared to their vision as highly magnifi ed. When using this method the investigator is fully co nscious.

Similarly, some of the ancient Mesoamericans may have accomplished these feats with the tools that a re described by historical texts as their apparatus fo r divination, including but not limited to Magic Mirr ors. Certain results and details from these accounts sug gest they achieved feats matched only by modern physicists wi th the most advanced equipment. In 1895 Leadbeater and Besant noted that Hydrogen, the lightest a~tom, was not a unity, but was compos ed of 18 smaller units. Each unit was then called an “ult imate physical a~tom,” or a-tom. Thirty years later they applied the Sanskrit term “ A n u ” (pronounced ahnoo) to the “ultimate physical a~tom.” 23 The Anu, they said, is the matter of El, and the material out of which all phy sical things are composed. 24 The Anu"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 01 All Anu, they said, existed in two varieties, posit ive and negative, and were formed of spirals that wound themselves in opposite directions.

Incredibly, Anu was also the name of the father of E.A. or Enki, the Su merian god-man of Me-ru who is equated with Osiris, the Eg yptian god of Ru and gardening. Leadbeater and Besant’s work was so advanced for it s time, and so accurate, that it has lead some contem porary authors to credit the two with the discovery of qua rks. They were fifty years ahead of two California Institute of Technology physicists, the American Murray Gell-Man n and Russian-born George Zweig, who independently proposed the first theory of quarks in 1964.

The smallest speck that can be seen under an ordinary microscope contains more tha n 10 billion atoms. The diameter of an atom ranges from about 0.1 to 0.5 nanometer.

Marie Sklodowska (SKILL-dow-ska) was a French physicist who became famous for her research on radioactivity. She recei ved two Nobel Prizes -- one in physics and one in chemistry . She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. Marie and her husband, Pierre Curie, also a physicist, worked tog ether in studying the radiation given off by radioactive substances. While historians credit Enrico Fermi with first pro ducing nuclear fission, to be technically accurate, Fermi first fused uranium nuclei. It was Lise (pronounced Lee zuh) Me itner (1878-1968), an Austrian-born physicist who played the essential role in the discovery of nuclear fission (the splitting of the nucleus of an atom). From 1934 to 1938, Meitner and German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann worked on the reactions t hat occur when neutrons bombard uranium nuclei. In December 1938, Hahn and Strassmann discovered that such bombardment produces nuclei of barium, a chemical element much lighter than uranium.

Irene Joliet-Curie identified the phenomenon of nuclear fission earlier than Meitner. She hid its horrendous power from the world because she feared it would be used as a weapon for mass murder. 2 She served as her mother’s assistant at the Radium Institute ( now the Curie Institute) in Paris where she also determined the conditions under which positrons (positive electron s) could be emitted when high-energy radioactive particles p assed through matter. In 1934, she and her husband demonstrated that the bombardment of boron by alpha particles created a radioactive isotope of nitrogen. This discovery, wh ich led to the production of artificial radioactive element s, resulted in their being awarded the Nobel Prize. As we can see, the development of nuclear fission w as far more dependent on women than current history promotes.

Many have thought that all matter was composed of rainbows because, when the sun hit an object (skin, hair, plants, water, stones) just right, it revealed mill ions of tiny rainbows. In Sumerian mythology, the Rainbow Bridge was an Ar c leading to Heaven. There were seven colors in the r ainbow, hence seven heavens. In Christian tradition, the se ven colors of the rainbow symbolize the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit to the Church -- the sacraments, doctrine, o ffice, polity, prayer and the powers to loosen ( fission) and to bind ( fusion) . 4 This Arc is often shown as a crescent moon encircli ng the sun or a star symbol radiating “moonshine.” Som etimes the goddess herself is depicted arching over humani ty (as below).

Another Hebrew story concerning the Ark, the word nun , and the grapes may provide the answer why. In the relevant episode (Numbers 13) Moses and the Isr aelites were enroute to the Promised Land. Yahweh ordered t hem to stop short and to send out some spies. One of Mo ses’ operatives, Joshua, an ancestor of Jesus, was calle d the “ Son of Nun .” Along with a companion, Joshua was dispatched to the valley of Eschol (‘valley of the cluster’) where he stole a cluster of grapes from the sons of Anak who were living there. He returned the grapes to Moses. Nun and the cluster of grapes later became cryptogr ams that were extremely important to the Essenes, the priesthood of which Jesus was a member, and the Gno stic Grail heretics that they held sacred and secret. Th e cluster of grapes symbolized the secrets of creation, the s ecrets of manipulating the mother substance and the symbol for the Grail. These secrets existed before the Flood and were ‘brought over’ into the new civilization.

Arcadia is Ame rica, and the secret of the Blue Apples -- the secret of the Grail - - was taken to there. What do these secrets concern? In their ground-breaking work Holy Blood, Holy Grail 10 authors Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Li ncoln presented the long-standing Grail heresy that Jesus had children.

Jesus hung from the Tree of Death, the Cross, but in so d oing became the Tree of Life. According to medieval Chri stian legend, Adam was buried on Golgotha (‘the Skull’). His son Seth returned to the Garden of Eden to retrieve a branch (the uas) from the Tree of Life (the Djed). He planted it on Golgotha where it grew into Christ’s Cross, the Tree of Crucifixion. This legend fuses the concepts of Genesis (creation ) with Crucifixion (death). Adam created original sin when he ate from the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden. Ch rist, through his Crucifixion, redeems us of this sin. Th ere seems to be an unseen, possibly Egyptian, hand work ing in the Crucifixion story of Jesus. According to legend, Jesus’ ancestor King David extensively researched Egyptian history. 1 4 He was particularly interested in the activities of Moses (c. 1400 B.C.) and his interactions with the Stones or Table ts of God and the Ark of the Covenant. Intuitive brilliance, careful analysis (and a lot of help from his wife, the Quee n of Saba) led David to discover the Ark’s whereabouts f rom these legends. In one tantalizing Hebrew story, retold by Manly P. Hall, when Adam was nearing the end of his life he sent Seth back to the Garden of Eden to fetch the Oil of Mercy which God had promised mankind.

When Seth returned home with them Adam was so overjoyed he died three days later, and the seeds w ere buried in his mouth, as the angel advised. The seed s became a tree which absorbed or ’sucked-up’ the blo od, and as I think, the soul, of Adam. Before the Flood Noah dug up the Tree (and probably a grape vine and its three grape seeds) for safekeepi ng in the Ark. After the Flood, he buried Adam’s skull under Mount Cavalry, where Jesus was later crucified. Paralleling the legend of the Tree of Life, Adam, s ays the Jewish legend, also gave a branch from the Tree , called the Key of Life by the Egyptians, to Enoch. Enoch g ave it to his great-grandson Noah, the hero of the Deluge who also brought it on the Ark.

He imagined atoms as small, hard particles, all composed of the same sub stance but of different sizes and shapes. These atomic gra ins, which Leucippus called “ the seeds of things ,” in their various forms, compose the four classic elements of earth, air, fire and water. 17 Atoms, concluded Leucippus, are infinite in number. All changes in the mineral, vegetable and animal wo rld are the result of the aggregation and disaggregation of the invisible a~tomic grains and their infinite possibl e forms. He believed that what is (atoms) and what is not (empty space) are both real. “Universally,” said Leucretius, “there is found to be nothing solid in things.” Everything around us is a n illusion (which Buddhists call ‘maya’).

In the Old Testament Noah’s Ark provided the grape seeds (the Blue Apples) that enabled Noah to bring new life to humanity. In this role, many symbolists relate t he Ark to the Word, which once spoken, will germinate the see ds of life. The Ark of the Covenant served as the symbol of God’s presence or frequency on Earth. In the New Testament, the Ark became the cup or receptacle tha t housed the blood of life, the symbol of the New Covenant.

Vannevar Bush personally delivered the thi rd and final National Academy of Sciences report on th e feasibility of the A-bomb to F.D.R. on November 27, 1941. The President returned it to him on January 19, 194 2. Attached was a handwritten note on White House stationary: “Jan 19 — V.B. — O.K. — returned — I th ink you had best keep this in your own safe F.D.R.” Thi s document is the only official paper documenting F.D .R.’s decision to build the A-bomb. 3 James Conant took the lead in the scientific area.

Over Christmas and into the first few weeks of Janu ary 1942 the project leaders at Columbia scoured Manhat tan for a building large enough to house a full-scale c hain- reacting pile. For security purposes, they called i t “the egg- boiling experiment.” Manhattan, however, was not th e place where the United States would boil this egg.

In 1923 Compton scattered X rays with a graphite block and demonstr ated what Einstein postulated in his theory of the photo electric effect: that light was wave but also simultaneously particle, photon. 5 “Arthur Compton and God were daily companions,” noted Leona Woods, Enrico Fermi’s apprentice at Chicago. 6 “The project for producing plutonium, as yet unseen even under a microscope, u sing a nuclear reactor that was still imaginary, and of fa shioning this plutonium into bombs whose explosiveness had n ever been tested, was now ready to go,” Compton later wr ote.

F.D.R. wrote, “I think the whole thing sho uld be pushed not only in regard to development, but also with due regard to time.” F.D.R. authorized Bush to turn over development work to the Army “on the condition that you yourself are certain that the War Department has ma de all adequate provision for absolute secrecy.” 7 On March 19, 1942 Bush wrote to F.D.R. of his effor t to accelerate the A-bomb project: “In accordance with your instructions (of October 9 , 1941), I have since expedited this work in every wa y possible. I now attach a brief summary report of th e status of the matter. Considerations of general policy and of internation al relations have been limited for the present to a gr oup consisting of Mr. Wallace, Secretary Stimson, Gener al Marshall, Dr. Conant and myself.

He could not turn ove r the A-bomb project to the War Department until he k new which method should be used in the plants that woul d manufacture the few kilograms of highly radioactive mass making up the core of each nuclear weapon.

With Wallace’s, and other Top Policy Group member’s approval, Conant selected the type of plants to bui ld. He recommended to Vannevar Bush that work continue on all four fronts simultaneously. In his report to F.D.R, Bush repeated Wallace and Conant’s decision. On June 17 Roosevelt authorized the simultaneous approach (“VB -OK- F.D.R.”). As the project was still an operation of the Top Policy Group, F.D.R.’s only question was: “Do you h ave the money?” 9 Bush maintained that he did.If not, F.D.R., we recall, had access to a secret source of funds."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 68 THE MANHATTAN PROJECT With F.D.R.’s OK on June 17, the A-bomb project too k flight. It take-off was slightly wobbly. The chief pilot, James Conant, was uncertain about which plant the b ird was headed toward to produce the core material. On June 19, 1942 the Manhattan District of the Army Corps o f Engineers was created to supervise the a~tomic bomb project. The project went by its code name of DSM ( for Development of Substitute Materials), but history k nows it best by its popular name the Manhattan Project. It was headquartered in Oak Ridge in East Tennessee, Chero kee Indian country. Before we head to East Tennessee it is important to explore the Grail’s connection to the prototype nuclear reactor that was first built at Colombia, m oved to Chicago and perfected at Oak Ridge. In their purest meaning, the symbols of the Grail r efer to the spiritual mastery of the human state and the return to our original core or center (which the Druids calle d Tula), and union with God. When one has ‘realized’ this un ion s/he has bridged the vast gulf (or leaped out of th e cosmic aquarium) separating man and God. The alchemists adopted the symbols of the Grail. In the period following the Renaissance, those European alchemists who believed the symbols referred to the transformation of lead into gold were known as “cha rcoal burners.” 10 A startling correspondence between the Grail and the early controlled nuclear chain reaction exp eriments centers around the substance used as a “moderator” for slowing the emitted neutrons from each fission to t hermal speed so that the capture and fission of adjacent n uclei"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 69 would be facilitated. Water was considered, as well as “heavy” water, a cocktail of oxygen and deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. The alchemists called quicksil ver (mercury) “heavy water.” 11 THE A~TOMIC PILE Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and their band of physici sts put their heads together to conceive and articulate a full- blown experiment to set up a controlled nuclear cha in reaction. Chief among their goals was to find a way to enrich uranium so that it could be used in a fissio n bomb. The chemists and physicists involved believed there was a new Promised Land beyond uranium where new elements were waiting to be discovered. Their faith was akin to a sailor at sea seeking new, uncharted lands. Fermi c alled this land transuranic . 12 The a~tomic pile project, where the foundations for the a~tomic era were laid, was first centered at Pupin Hall, at Columbia University. There, Fermi (who emigrated fr om Italy to the United States in 1938, but who was not yet an American citizen, and was therefore technically an “enemy alien”), and the Hungarian born Szilard and Edward Teller looked to duplicate the process which created the e nergy of the stars: intense heat that caused light nuclei, s uch as hydrogen, to fuse and in the process liberate incre dible amounts of energy."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 70 These paintings by John Cadel illustrate the constr uction of the CP-1 (Chicago Pile-No. 1) reactor, assembled of thousands of graphite blocks and uranium pellets.

Graphite is one of the forms of carbon and is also known as black lead . When the first nuclear reactor was finished in September 1941 it was an extremely pure carbon grap hite column or pillar 3 by 3 by 8 feet. By placing a neutron source at the base of the graphite pillar, and meas uring gear at key positions, the Columbia scientists were able to study the behavior of the neutrons as they sped through t he carbon. This practice came to be known as a “lattice pile.” Fermi named the structure a “pile.” He was using th e American term for a “ heap .” He called it a “pile” because it was, literally, a pile of bricks of uranium, uraniu m oxide, and graphite. The cubical lattice pile was composed of 288 8 by 8 inch cans holding about 60 pounds of uranium"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 72 oxide. The Columbia football team did the stacking. In addition, “pile” suited the Manhattan Project’s cru cial need for secrecy. “Pile” was a neutral term that would n ot reveal the nature of project if the enemy were to hear of it. After the war, the somewhat squat term “a~tomic pile” yie lded to the more powerful and technically appropriate term, nuclear reactor . The controlled nuclear chain reaction experiment involved building a furnace or “pile” -- a reactor -- in which a mass of uranium would be deposited and mixe d with the graphite “moderator.” Looking at this pile through Lord Rutherford’s eyes of holy science, the lattice pile is essentially an al tar made of a pile of graphite bricks with small spaces between t hem forming a latticework. These bricks separated small lumps of ordinary uranium. When fast neutrons ejected by the fission or splitting of U-235 in any one lump had t o pass through a gauntlet of moderating graphite. This slo wed them down enough to be absorbed by the U-235 a~toms , causing them to fission. Within months the world’s first a~tomic pile would be constructed on the squash court under the west stan ds of Stagg Field. When the first a~tomic pile was finish ed, it was 30 feet wide, 32 feet long and 211/2 feet hit. It weighed 1400 tons. 52 tons of its mass was uranium. Precisely at 3:25 P.M., Chicago time, scientist Geo rge Weil withdrew the cadmium-plated control rod and by this action man unleashed and controlled the energy of the a~tom. Right after Fermi ordered the reaction stopped, Eug ene Wigner presented him with a bottle of Chianti wine. Fermi"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 73 uncorked the wine bottle and sent out for paper cup s so that all could drink to their success. A few mometns later James Conant was in his office at Dunbarton Oaks, when he received a telephone call f rom Arthur Compton in Chicago. “Jim, you‘ll be interest ed to know the Italian navigator has just landed in the n e w world.” The Italian navigator was Enrico Fermi, the physicist in charge of the a~tomic pile at Stagg Fi eld. “Were the natives friendly?” asked Conant. “Everyon e landed safe and happy,” replied Compton. 13 Let us take a moment to tally up a few Grail synchronicities. In Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul Titus Burckhardt writes: “In alchemical terms, “lea d“ represents the chaotic, ‘heavy’, and sick condition of metal or of the inward man (Adam), while gold -- ‘congeal ed light’ and ‘earthly sun’ -- expresses the perfectio n of both metallic and human perfection.” 14 The University of Chicago’s Stagg Field, where the first a~tomic pile project took place, was named af ter Alonzo Stagg, a football player. However, from the Grail perspective the field is appropriately named. In Gr ail literature the stag is the symbol for Christ, and t he intercessor between Earth and Heaven. Origen makes the stag the enemy or destroyer of serpents. 15 The scientists at Chicago had come to Stagg Field t o slay the a~tomic serpent. Because of the spread of its antlers, which seasonally drop and grow again, the stag is often compared with the Tree of Life and symbolizes rebirth."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 74 These beliefs are commonly found in the decorations of Christian baptistries as well as in Muslim, shamani stic, Mayan and Pueblo Indian tradition. It is a primary symbol of continual creation and renewal. The Hopi cut the ir sacred image of the Sun-god from deerskin. Its spir aling horns represented energy, which may be one reason w hy Michaelangelo and other artists sculpted Moses with horns. Fascinatingly, the stag, like the reindeer, is also the herald of daylight and guide to the light of the Su n. This is highlighted by the Pawnee hymn to the light of dawn : “We call to the Children; we bid them awake... We tell th e Children that all the animals are awake. They come forth from their places where they have been sleeping. Th e stag leads them. She comes from her cover, bringing her young into the light of day. Our hearts are glad.” 16 At Chicago the word “tubaloy” was substituted for uranium. Tubaloy is an anagram for Tula-boy. The Met Lab is synchronistic with Met, the Egyptian word for truth. Met was the material out of which t he Ark of Noah that took humanity into a new world was made. The “lattice pile” of bricks rings of the laterus p ile of bricks of Enoch. In Scottish Freemasonry, which beg an at the dawn of the fourteenth century, Enoch (whom the Egyptians called Thoth) is credited with giving hum anity the secrets of books and writing. He gave the secre ts of building only to the Freemasons. According to legend, Enoch was warned of the coming deluge.

The vaults were then sealed, and u pon the spot Enoch supervised the construction of two magni ficent, indestructable columns. One was made of fire-proof marble. The other of Laterus , or brick, so that it would not sink in water. In other words, it was a floating stone. 18 In Druid myth, the floating stone was a blue glass blown in the shape of an egg or apple by the serpen ts of wisdom. 19 Out of this floating stone was born the phoenix or heron who utters the Word. In Egyptian myth, the heron landed at Heliopolis or On, aka Tula, atop the pill ar or ben ben stone, and delivers an egg, ball or apple conta ining the wisdom concerning the Holy Blood. Wolram in his Parzival expressly states that the Grail is a stone from which the Phoenix rises. Therefore, the Grail is th e floating stone. One can only wonder from these synchronicities if the a~tomic pile at Stagg Field in Chicago was a re-wor king of the primordial heap or pile of the heron.

The press called the cyclotron “the a~tom smasher” because it smashed the a~toms with particl es spit from the accelerator. In the fall of 1940 a Berkeley chemist by the name of Glenn Seaborg was hard at work bombarding uranium w ith neutrons produced by a cyclotron. He had already be en part of team under Edwin McMillan that discovered a new element that lay beyond uranium, then the heaviest known element in the Periodic Table of Elements. McMillan named the element after the planet Neptune, which h ad recently been discovered. Back at Berkely Seaborg continued his research in search of element number 94. On February 25, 1941 Seaborg announced that his team had found evidence that they had isolated the ninety-fourth element, pluton ium-238. Seaborg continued to bombard uranium in the cyclotr on in order to achieve plutonium-239. As the lab became h otter and hotter with radiation Seaborg put on protective goggles and lead gloves, and stood behind lead shields. The y placed the radioactive potion into a tube, which they inse rted in a beaker. Like the Israelites carrying the Ark, they then carried the lead casket from lab to lab in a wooden box with long poles, which served as handles. On March 6, 19 41 Seaborg’s team had succeeded in isolating the ninet y-fourth element.

It earned McMillan and Seabor g the Nobel Prize. Even though there were now two elements that potentially could be used to create a chain reactio n, the question remained how would plutonium be produced? Lawrence calculated that if a cyclotron could produ ce a milligram of plutonium a month, it would take 500,0 00 years to accumulate enough to build a bomb.

He fir st visited nearby Los Alamos in the summer of 1922, the same summer that Roerich founded Crown of the World, Inc. As an amateur prospector, or “rock hound,” Oppenheimer had the wealth to pursue his passion. A s he remarked, he was not interested in the scientific a spects of mining or rocks, his fascination was with “crystals , their structure, birefringence, what you saw in polarized light, and all the canonical business.” Both Oppie and Roe rich shared a passion for the power of stones.

Whenever Tula (heaven/mother) is mentioned its mean ing is dualistic: one Tula is on Earth, another Tula is in space. This is another way of saying one Tula is “in here“ and the other is “out there.” Although you may have never heard of Tula, it is almost certain you have heard of one of the many co lorful legends that are derived from it. Atlantis, Zion, t he New Jeruslaem, Camelot, Avalon, even Oz (Hebrew for ‘strength is within’) -- all are attempts at recrea ting Tula and finding the Key of Life within us that will ena ble our metamorphosis from human to angel.

TULA: THE GREAT MOTHER No matter where the word Tula appeared it represent ed the Great Mother. Her lore dominated the thinking o f the ancients who believed our souls came from Tula and our mission on Earth was to learn to return to Tula. Simultaneously, we were to turn the Earth, herself, into a Tula. Jesus called this the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. I t is awareness of the original concepts of Tula, includi ng those of Jesus that we are now being asked to absorb. The Apocalyptic-minded believe we are being asked to learn the teachings that will place us in attunement or reson ance with Tula in preparation for our return home. Just recently, a rather remarkable event has occurr ed. NASA has trained its powerful Compton Gamma Ray Observatory on the galactic core. NASA scientists discovered a fountain of exotic particles spewing f rom this region. While NASA expressed uncertainty concerning the nature of these energies ancient myths may fill in the blanks. According to Greek myths, this heart of Tula beats and vibrations spread through the galaxy. This Central Sun is a fountain of healing energy, healing ‘waters’ or ‘li ving waters’. It is even considered to be the Holy Grail itself. The Egyptians, says HPB, called Tula’s primordial water the Ra-shoo or Ras-hoo or solar fire. 10 This term coincides perfectly with the proposition that the ‘ living"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 97 waters’ are the higher vibrational energies, and th at the Key of Life is to learn to harness these powerful heali ng energies. The potential discovery of this fountain is one of the most profound discoveries of our time. However, it is only half the story. Ancient wisdom traditions maintain humans, and all other beings in our galaxy, emanate from an d share a common home. This home is at the center of our Mi lky Way galaxy and is called Tula. Another group who ho ld stories about Tula are the Cherokee. THE CHEROKEE: TULA PEOPLE Under the direction of Robert Oppenheimer and General Groves some of America’s greatest minds at college campuses across the country would become ho t nodes in an interconnected web of private and gover nment laboratories, factories and other facilities that c onstituted the Manhattan Project. This project was run from Oa k Ridge, Tennessee in Cherokee Indian country. Who were the Cherokee? The Cherokee oral tradition related by Dhyani Ywahoo, a twenty-seventh generati on Cherokee, tells a story whose elements are by now f amiliar to us. 11 It tells how the first Cherokee came from the star system known as the Pleiades (which the Egyptians c alled “ the Khem ” and the Greeks called “ the Atlantides ”). The first spark of individuated mind came from there as well. From the void came a Creator Being who first appear ed as a universal tone that was also a light. The first b eings to emerge from this light were called tla (which stands for"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 2 98 Tula) beings or “thought beings.” 12 Star Woman fell to Earth, opening the way for the star beings to appear. There were twelve tribes in all, each coalescing along twelve vortices or holes in the Earth. These original twelve tribes were called the Tsalagi Nation. Each nation handled a particular vortex and a particular responsibility. 13 These twelve vortexes sound astonishingly similar t o Plato’s description of the Earth as a 12-angled pyr amid with each angle representing a “hole” or vortex. Th e Egyptians claimed a worm-like creature named Chnoub i s was the guardian of this 12-angled pyramid. Cherokee mythology related by James Mooney tells of a great snake called Uktena who was “...as large arou nd as a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright blazing crest like a diamond upon its forehead, and scales glittering like sparks of fire.” 1 4 This diamond in his forehead was described as a large transparent crystal that conta ined enormous spiritual power that could work miracles. This “diamond-like crystal” sounds strikingly simil ar to the ME tablets of the serpent E.A., the Book of Lov e of Jesus hidden in Southern France, and the “diamond” terma boxes Padma Saba Ava hid in the hills and valleys o f Tibet. Uktena’s crystal is described as shaped like a bull et with a vertical red streak running through its center. The Cherokee claim that Uktena’s crystals were actual artifacts that preserved sacred knowledge. In fact, Cherokee relig ion appears to be structured around their knowledge of Quartz crystal. As if to emphasize the importance of Quartz crystal , each of the twelve original tribes of the Cherokee Nation exemplified a particular aspect of Cherokee life.

Of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth lines th e Cherokee do not speak. It is beyond words, says Ms. Ywahoo. 15 The Cherokee tell of the Sacred Seven star people who came to Earth in five islands in the Atlantic Ocean we now know of as Atlantis. The Sacred Seven (who remind m e of the seven Druid Buds or Birds and the seven Saba wh o also came from the Pleiades) intermarried with the Child ren of the Sun, the Earth people. 16 Their children are the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Yuchi, and other Red (rose or Roos?) nations of the southeastern United States. Others found their way to South and Central America and eventually intermarried wit h the family living in the Four Corners area of the Ameri can Southwest. 41 Like their Hopi brethren, the Cherokee were visited by a teacher called the Pale One who reminded them of the Law and recalled all to right relationship w ith the creator. The Cherokee say he is expected again soon. 41 Another part of the family is found in Ohio. They a re the Mound Builders, the temple keepers of the Ameri cas. Fascinatingly, they preserve a tradition of temple society composed of four levels of people: • The Sun People were the rulers. • The Noble, • The average people, and • The Stinkards.

Strangely, the Watauga are widely acknowledge d as America’s first free and independent community. For med in North Carolina (in what today is in East Tenness ee) in 1772 mainly by Scots-Irish settlers, the Watauga Association was the precursor to the state of Tenne ssee. 17 (Originally, Tennessee was called Franklin, after B enjamin Franklin who harnessed the power of lightning with his key.) From the time the Scots-Irish arrived this part of Tennessee would be best known for its hillbillies a nd moonshine, or “white lightning.” The East Tennessee hills were home to thousands of Scots-Irish who poured in to the Smoky Mountain and Appalachian hill-country. They brought their traditional music with them. Among th e songs heard in these hills were ballads of King William o f Orange. Those who sung them were tagged Billy-boys of the hill-country or “ hillbillies .” 18 The echoes of their distinctive sound linger in the recording studios of Nashville, Tennessee, today kn own as “Music City U.S.A.” (or Meru-sic?), home of country music and the capitol of Tennessee.

In the old days, they say, Lord Rutherford would not have had to look far in the Smokies for a bottle of the clear b rew they called “white lightning.” By the Revolutionary War era Tennessee moonshiners had earned extensive distribu tion, and a certain reputation, throughout America.

As one gazes upon “the stone of lig ht,” mystical awareness arises from the heart and initia tes a transformation of consciousness. This transformation is identical to the transformat ion of the kundalini energies represented by the Key of Li fe. Mystics believe that this occurs at the moment when the human soul becomes the living vessel of the Christ- consciousness. Its placement at the very center of the base of the UN is meant to emphasize its role as a ‘cubi c stone’ or ‘foundation stone’."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 3 08 THE PALLADIUM GRAIL AND COLD FUSION The Grail’s connection to the ‘living waters’ leads us to the controversial process known as Cold Fusion or “chemically assisted nuclear reactions.” a low-ener gy nuclear reaction that, theoretically, produces an i nfinite supply of free, clean energy. Using a simple table- top apparatus electro-chemical process University of Ut ah professors Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann reve aled a paradigm-shattering breakthrough. On March 23, 1989 they announced that they had measured nuclear-scale excess energy from a jar of palladium-heavy water electrochemical cell, and tha t they had also detected some preliminary evidence of nucl ear signatures from their exotic energy-producing react ions. All of this without the dangerous radiation which accompanies “hot” fusion. Suddenly, the possibility of making nuclear energy at home in a Mason jar (a form of grail) was the cente r of attention around the world, especially in the Oval Office and at Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexi co. The world was awed by the possibility of overcoming our dependence on fossil fuels and the prospect of crea ting world peace by providing infinite, free energy. This discovery of Palladium’s Cold Fusion secrets h as been regarded as the most significant scientific di scovery in recorded history. Some believe its significance wil l dwarf that of electronics, computers and genetic engineer ing. Since the first Cold Fusion discovery was announced in 1989, over 3,000 research papers have been written and"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 3 09 published and resulted in investigations by over 20 0 laboratories in thirty countries. (However papers o f Cold Fusion have been published since 1943.) Still the “official” scientific oligarchy and the establishment, which backed it with billions upon b illions of dollars of research money, rejected the “miracle ” and the truth of Cold Fusion. As Sir Arthur C. Clarke state d in 1998, this is the greatest scandal of the twentieth century (if not all human history). What if it turns out palladium is the Black Stone, the Holy Grail? Are we living in the new kingdom of the Holy Grail? Was this part of the goal of F.D.R. and Henr y Wallace? Will the third millennium see the return o f Christ? Will the secrets of the A~tomic Christ brin g about a new paradise on Earth."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"THE A~TOMIC CHRIST 3 10 NOTES AND REFERENCES CHAPTER ONE: F.D.R.
