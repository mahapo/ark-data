THE ILLUMINIST’S SECRET GARDEN “ No one, when he has lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place .” 1 My journey, in writing The Cloak of the Illuminati , began with a desire to understand the perplexing connection between two drawings. One, of the mysterious ancient Buddhist Pillar of Meru or Su- Meru (the cosmic center world-axis whose summit towered into the golden light of Heaven) from a 2 nd century Chinese religious manuscript and the other the modern Tennessee Capitol Mall, a $55 million, 2,200 foot long axis or pillar (not a shopping mall) laid out flat on 19 green acres in Nashville, Tennessee, where I live. As I soon learned, the Bicentennial Mall is an illuminist’s secret garden. It is a geometric garden in the shape of a magician’s rod or wand whose design directly affects those who walk it; it helps them to draw down and render accessible the Holy Spirit or pure life energy . Comparing the drawings on the next page we can see that each clearly is an axis that resembles an antenna. In fact, Meru myth says it is a massive tuning capicitor. 2 It had been the home of the immortals. They dwelled at Meru because of the energy attracted there. They reappear whenever a new spiritual revelation is required, 3 or when a Golden Age commences. These are, incredibly, the Tree of Life, the living tree that gives life and supplies the spiritual food called bread or manna , the heavenly host, which had been rained, or was transmitted from heaven (more on manna momentarily)."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 2 Meru pillar from a 2 nd century Chinese manuscript (left). The Tennessee Capitol Mall in Nashville (right)."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 3 The Tennessee Bicentennial Capitol Mall."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 4 The word Meru appears in many forms. As mero, it means “waters” and “mother-love” in Egyptian. 4 Coincidentally, or perhaps not, Nashville was originally called the Mero district. Based upon the interchangeability of the words Meru and Mero, I refer to the Nashville pillar as a Meru ‘Axis of Love’. Like the Buddhist pillar, Nashville’s Meru is composed of two primary elements; a ring (the most basic feminine symbol), and a pillar, mound, pyramid or cone , the universal symbol for Meru, which happens to be the Egyptian hieroglyph for ‘bread’ and ‘offering’. The Meru pillar is topped by a , the symbol for a door. Similarly, two rays or horns that are suggestive of vortex shapes form an inverted cone or pyramid at the top of the Nashville Meru pillar. The architect of the Capitol Mall says he does not see a resemblance between the two drawings. He stigmatizes me as having untrained eyes. Still, such an obvious kinship between two places and structures, in two different parts of the world, in two different times, seems incredible. How did this happen? TRIANGULA I made the discovery while researching a book I was writing about FDR’s quest for the Holy Grail. As I documented in The A ~ tomic Christ: FDR’s Search for the Secret Temple of the Christ Light , 5 in 1934 FDR sent flamboyant Russian painter Nicholas Roerich to Mongolia (land of Min , goddess of love) in search of signs of Jesus and the secrets of the Holy Grail. His destination was the blazing gold Mount Meru and Shambhala, the Buddhist paradise on the edge of what I call ‘triangula’, the vortex where myth, ancient technology and history merge. Shambhala is derived from Sabala whose elements ‘sa’, ‘ba’ and ‘la’ mean ‘blood’, ‘soul’ and ‘light’ respectively. 6 Derivatives of the word include cabala (cable) , kabala or kabbala ;"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 5 in Hebrew: qabbala , tradition or something that is passed down or transmitted . Saba means ‘host’, another term for manna . Guru, mystic, family man, friend of Lenin, the charismatic Roerich was either a Russian spy or a prophet. He had a spellbinding hold on Henry A. Wallace, FDR’s occult-minded Secretary of Agriculture (and fellow 32 nd degree Mason), and even the rock-jawed President. A seasoned explorer, he traced the trail of the seventeen ‘missing’ years of Jesus and promised the return of his secrets of ‘blood, soul, and light’ to America. Roerich conducted this search with panache. When the crafty Druid turned messianic and headed for Russia bent on inciting revolution, the New Deal cut him off. Wallace turned the Treasury Department loose on him, discredited his reputation and prevented him from returning to America. His pivotal role in the search for the secrets of the Holy Grail was covered-up, even by his followers. What did Roerich learn that is so powerful that even his followers won’t discuss it? Does it explain why, in 1935, at the request of Wallace and Roerich FDR ordered the Great Seal, the Illuminist (new-Templar) symbol of the returning Christ to Masons that had laid dormant for over 150 years, stamped on the back of the one dollar bill?"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 6 The Great Seal of the United States of America. Great Seal of the Illuminati. What is the code concealed in the Great Seal on the dollar bill? A Masonic writer pointed out that this eye is the Sol-oeil -- the “Sun-eye,” or Spiritual Sun, which lay hidden behind the French word for the Sun, soleil. 7 The Spiritual Sun is the Healing Sun at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. According to Masonic symbolism researcher David Ovason, 8 to Freemasons this symbol, and the building of Washington D.C. itself, represented the rebuilding of the Temple of Sol-Om-On, the King of the Jews (c. 1100 BC). Masonic fraternities of the United States visualized the nation’s capital in Washington D.C. as the founding stone of a new Golden Age that would see the Second Coming and the return of Solomon’s secrets... the Axis of Love or Meru (Mount Moriah in Jerusalem). In this quest FDR, Wallace and Roerich re-enacted the myth of the Three Wise Men or Magi (“Great Skilled Ones” and “Lords of the Elements”). The Chronicle of Zuquin , one of the traditional stories about the Three Magi, relates how the Magi climb the World Axis or Mountain ( Meru ) every year to look for signs of the coming redeemer. Eventually a star appears and a Divine or Mighty Child descends in a pillar of light to tell the Magi to go to the Bethelehem, the “ house of Bread .” As the Magi near the cave (womb, navel) where the Divine Child is being born (Meru, where all Mighty Children are born), they see a pillar of light descend to the cave filling it with a light brighter than the sun (see icon on the next page). 9 At work in the icon is the pillared crescent, a symbol for the scepter of God. It represents the ringing Pillar of Heaven. After Jacob scaled this ladder to the Eye of God he anointed it with oil. Christ or Christos, we must remember, is not a proper name. It is a title. It means ‘anointed’. To anoint is to bathe or baptize oneself in the oil or Holy Spirit (manna). In Egypt this anointing was depicted as a baptism in the living waters or keys (tones) of life."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 7 A beam of light enters the cave of the Nativity."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 8 This detail from a manuscript dated 1081 shows monks climbing the Ladder or Axis of Love.

This explains why ATON , the Egyptian name for the healing rays of the Central Sun, is also the root for ADON or “Lord,” a title later given to Jesus. In c. 1,400 BC the pharaoh Amenhotep IV, known as Akhenaton, introduced a monotheistic mystery religion based upon the principles of the hidden Central Sun ATON, or simply ‘the Disk’. He is frequently depicted receiving the Key of Life from ATON. Some researchers of Akhenaton have concluded that his successor and brother, Tutankhamun, was the historical Jesus. These associations illuminate the numerous portrayals of Jesus as a young shepherd with a lamb, the symbol of wisdom, on his shoulders. The Christos -- the tone, frequency or vibration -- is literally the white or pure carrier wave for this wisdom. This coding is carried forward in the term, INRI, nailed to the cross of crucifixion by Pontius Pilate. The Bible says it means “Jesus the Nazarene King of the Jews.” In the Gnostic tradition, however, INRI means Igen Natura Renovatura Integra ; “by fire nature is renewed whole,” pointing to Jesus’ role as a deliverer of higher frequency knowledge or ‘fire’. INRI, we may conclude, is another term for manna. The Illuminati, including the Rosicrucians, altered the meaning of INRI to IGNE NITRUM RORIS INVENITUR or “the baptism or cleansing power of dew is only discovered by fire.” In the Book of Revelation, 10 the return of INRI covers the Earth like fresh dew and triggers a thousand years of Peace, or the rebirth of Earth. Mayan oracles say this will commence in 2012. This ‘dew’ is also the same as duv (dove), the alchemical secrets of the Duv-ine or Divine (S)tone, and the healing tones of Aton or Adon, Christ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 10 Akhenaton receives the Key of Life from the Aton disk."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 11 Jesus uses the wand or rod to raise Lazarus (L’Osiris) from the dead.

According to this legend, the Three Magi were given a small casket containing a stone. On their journey home they cast the stone into a well of great depth and immediately fire descended from heaven into that well, then reared up in a blaze that lit the sky. Meru reaches 350,000 miles into space, according to the Indian epic the Mahabarata. 11 In one of his letters to Roerich (dated March, 1933), Wallace wrote, “we await the casket , the sacred most precious casket,” making it clear that FDR, Nicholas Roerich and Henry Wallace were in search of this Divine Child of love and his secret metamorphosing axis/pillar or Stone of the Christ Light. This is the true Holy Grail. In this letter Wallace told Roerich they awaited the Stone (the axis or pillar of love) in the ‘New Country’. This is America, which since the publication of Sir Francis Bacon’s prophetic novel The New Atlantis in 1626 has been considered the ‘New Atlantis’ by the Rosicrucians and other ‘illumined’ ones. Bacon prophesied the New Atlantis as a technologically and spiritually advanced civilization that would arise in America. The symbolism of Meru reveals the American connection. This is the simple symbol for the cosmic mount Meru. It is symbolically equivalent to the All Seeing Eye on the Great Seal. The dot in the center of the circle is equal to the point at the top of the ringed or ringing Meru cone. The eye is the Egyptian symbol for sun and gold . Meru is considered the Golden World. We may come to a deeper understanding of these Meru Pillars by keeping in mind that Meru was the name for the central mountain of Atlantis. The people of Atlantis, called Merodes or"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 14 ‘Children of the Sun’, were descendants of Meroo or Merod . The Meropes of Homer (O-Meer) are the Lords of Mount Meru . 12 In numerous accounts Atlantean civilization is driven by a mysterious energy or power source. Meru symbolism reveals this source. The Divine Circle , we noted, is the symbol for the eye, for gold and is a top-down view of the Meru pillar. It is also the symbol for our Milky Way galaxy with the • representing its Central Sun or Galactic Core, called Tula . Atlantis was also known as Ultima Thule or Tula . 13 Bethelehem or Be-tula-hem is literally the “ house of the Tula Stone ”. The ancients considered Tula the source of our souls, and the source of manna. This zero point is also a potential source of an immense and virile (or Vril ) power. Fascinatingly, Tula is Sanskrit for ‘balance’, zero point. The zodiacal sign for Libra, the scales , representing balance is . To me, resembles the rising hub of the Milky Way. It represents the Holy Spirit , also called the Word , the essence of life, manna. 14 Alchemists alternated between and when signifying the essence of a substance , or the spirit . 15 It is MaMa. Its emanations are manna, or M’Ana, the ‘light of Heaven ( Ana )’. The Central Nuclear Bulge of the Milky Way is a mass concentration of stars. The center of the galaxy is where most stars and entities are formed due to the closer proximity and the larger magnetic and gravitational fields. Metaphysicians claim this realm of light is the home of millions of crystaline light beings. 16 It is invisible to the naked eye because its light must travel through thousands of light-years of gas and cosmic dust before it reaches us. Like Meru, it requires spiritual vision to perceive it."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 15 The Milky Way in infrared, COBE satellite. (photo © NASA) Though it is the center and source of all great religion, many myths emphasize that, like its healing light, the secrets of the Core have remained cloaked, hidden from the mass of humanity for millennia. The hidden Healing Sun, also known as the ‘Black Sun’, • , has been veiled. To pull back this cloak is to reveal the secrets of creation , and the secrets of the Illuminati. The Meru Axis of Love is the cable/channel/link between Earth and Tula. In the alchemical text, The Bahir (“Brightness”), Jewish mystics called this Tree a Teli , an axis or pole connecting the underworld with Earth and the heavens. 17 Significantly, Teli is from talah or TULA (or TLA), Hebrew for ‘hang’, ‘suspended’. Tela is web. Teli is also TLI. Another way to look at TLI would be as: T=300, L=50, and I=10. 18 TLI, therefore, is 360, a completed"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 16 circle or a ring . is also zero, none, phonetically nun , the Hebrew word meaning ‘fish’.

The Indian artists of North America symbolized the fifth element, the Quintessence, (or the Word , the “life force”), as a . 19 Often, they added specks inside the circle to show that it was full. Interestingly, the Mayan word for ‘stone’ and for 360, , days is tun (tone or tune). Tun also means maize or corn. To the alchemists corn is gold. It was the Adon Jesus, the fish, who delivered the secret of the Word to the disciples in a cornfield on the Sabbath. As recorded in Matthew 12:1-8, Mark 2:23-28, Luke 6:1-5 Jesus and the disciples secretly rubbed corn in their hands. When the Pharisees discovered them they questioned Jesus. His reply, given in Matthew 12:4 is most illuminating. “Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him: “How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat, but was for the priests.” The shewbread is another term for manna. From this we may conclude that Jesus was teaching the disciples the secrets of manna while in the cornfield. “To him that overcometh,” he later proclaimed in Revelation 2:17, “will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 17 2. SEVEN STARS UNDER THE THREE STARS The Illuminist’s garden in Nashville is a blueprint for the design of the Meru Axis. Theoretically, when one takes the Long Walk at the Capitol Mall in Nashville they are absorbing the energy or ring of Heaven through their body system. In so doing, they are absorbing the deepest secrets of Jesus, and as we will see, are simultaneously putting on the Cloak of the Illuminati The clue that led me to Nashville as a possible location for the Meru center of the New Atlantis was provided when Henry Wallace said the New Country was going forth to meet the Seven Stars under the Three Stars. Where is this? The first three stars that come to mind are the three belt stars of Orion. In Mongolian myth they were associated with Meru. Nicholas Roerich records an aboriginal name for Mount Belukha, another Meru location, “Orion, Dwelling of the Gods.” 1 In Mongolian myth Meru and Orion went together, says Roerich. Stars prompt us to look to state flags. Tennessee is the only state in the union whose flag has three and only three stars. If Wallace was indicating Tennessee, then where are the seven stars under the three stars in Tennessee? Tennessee’s logo is the rising sun, an Illuminati logo. Two groups of seven stars vied for attention in the ancient world. The Pleiades, also called the Hathors, and the constellation"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 18 Ursa Major the Great Bear ( Arktos ), otherwise known as the Big Dipper or Meru. Both constellations have important Tennessee connections. In East Tennessee the Cherokee oral tradition related by Dhyani Ywahoo, a twenty-seventh generation Cherokee, tells a story whose elements are by now familiar to us. 2 It tells how the first Cherokee came from the Pleiades (which the Egyptians called “ the Khem ” and the Greeks called “ the Atlantides ”). The first spark of individuated mind came from there as well. From the Void came a Creator Being who first appeared as a universal tone that was also a light . The first beings to emerge from this light were called tla (which stands for Tula) beings or “thought beings.” 3 Star Woman fell to Earth, opening the way for the star beings to appear. There were twelve tribes in all, each coalescing along twelve vortices or holes in the Earth. These original twelve tribes were called the Tsalagi Nation. Each nation handled a particular vortex and a particular responsibility. 4 These twelve vortexes are astonishingly similar to Plato’s description of the “True” Earth as a 12-angled pyramid with each angle representing a “hole” or vortex. The Egyptians claimed a worm-like creature named Chnoubis was the guardian of this 12- angled pyramid. Correspondingly, Cherokee mythology related by James Mooney tells of a great snake called Uk- Tena who was “...as large around as a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright blazing crest like a diamond upon its forehead, and scales glittering like sparks of fire.” 5 This diamond in his forehead was described as a large transparent crystal that contained enormous spiritual power that could work miracles. The Cherokee claim that Uktena’s crystals were actual artifacts that preserved sacred knowledge. In fact, Cherokee religion appears to be structured around their knowledge of Quartz crystal. The sky is the limit on the potential of this knowledge. For instance, our modern computer industry is based upon our knowledge of Quartz crystal and its ability to augment, store, amplify and transmit information. The grid or matrix of Earth is largely composed of crystal."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 19 Was Wallace referring to East Tennessee, home of the Cherokee (and the world’s first nuclear reactor)? Or, is there another possible (equally phenomenal) location in Tennessee? Astonishingly, there is. Nashville. In Arab tradition, Ursa Major was called Na’ash or Nash , the Great Coffin. 6 The dual definition emerges from the phonetic and vibrational similarity of the words bear ( arktos ) and bier or coffin/casket (the root of birth ). Another name for these seven stars is Meru . The Arab association of the word Nash with a coffin is stunning when it is realized that Nash-ville, Tennessee is a giant Indian graveyard, a great coffin! In Indians and Artifacts In the Southeast , 7 Bert W. Bierer writes, “A considerable portion of the city of Nash-ville has been built over an extensive Indian graveyard.” He further says, “The ancient burial grounds on the banks of Nashville’s Cumberland River, in 1844, extended more than a mile along the river.” Significantly, Nashville is on a ‘pearl necklace’ of important sacred sites that rings the Earth and includes: • The Giza Pyramids of Egypt, • Rennes-le-Chateau, the home of the Cathars in the wine country of Southern France, • Mongolia, • Hawaii, • Vancouver, British Columbia. • The Four Corners Area of the Southwestern United States (where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet). • Oak Island, Nova Scotia, home to a sunken shaft or pillar vault of the Templars, and • The Southeastern quadrant of America including Kentucky and Tennessee. These sites are described as “cities of light.” 8 I imagine them as ‘docking stations’ where Heaven and Earth connect.

The two places were obviously similar to me. But what were they? The Tennessee Capitol Mall is the sister complex to the National Mall in Washington D.C., the long axis that ends with the 555 ft. tall monolithic shaft topped by a delta or pyramid dedicated to George Washington, father of ancient A-meru-ka or America. It is worth noting David Ovason’s masterful work The Secret Architecture of Our Nation’s Capital . Ovason notes that at a subliminal level the Washington Monument is designed so that no matter where one is in Washington they will see the pyramid floating in the skies on its shaft of light. 9 It is linked with the deep Masonic mysteries of Washington D.C. Cross-checking ancient mysteries, we find that such shafts are called On or An in Egypt in tribute to Anu , the Sumerian god of light. The hieroglyph for An is self-explanatory. The word mall is a play on male , as the Washington Monument, the Su-Meru drawing and the Tennessee Mall are all phallic or Mentula symbols. They’re poles or pall malls . In the ancient world they were known as the ashera symbols of the goddesses who were known as the Mediatrix . Importantly, Ovason revealed the connection between the layout of the Washington D.C. and the constellation Virgo the Virgin who suckles the Christ Child. In Egypt, the Virgin was Isis- Hathor, the Mediatrix or female Peacemaker, and purveyor of the secrets of alchemy. She was the provider of the Bread of Life, the manna . In Christian terms she became Mary ( Mari ) whose son, Christ (the Holy Spirit) provided the bread of the host."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 22 The Catholic Church is dramatically pushing to make Mary the modern Mediatrix and co-redeemer. Prayers to Mary are an intricate part of Roman Catholic worship. There is no biblical basis for this idea. In fact, 1 Timothy 2:5 proclaims that Jesus is the sole Mediator between God and man. This statement suggests that there is neither any place, nor any necessity for another mediator or peacemaker. So, why the massive centuries-long effort to add Mary as Mediatrix? Is it simply that humanity is in desperate need of the feminine touch? In addition to her titles of “Mediatrix,” “Mother of God” and “Queen of Heaven” Mary is also inexplicably known as the “Spouse of the Holy Spirit”. This is most interesting, as another way of phrasing this would be “Spouse of the Manna.” In an ancient secretly accessed crypt located beneath the Holy of Holies in the Temple of the Egyptian Mediatrix, Isis-Hathor, at Denderah, Egypt is a wall relief of enormous mystery. A giant human holds a bulb-shaped object in which a serpent or tube is floating. The bulb-shaped object and the snake end in a TET pillar, from which a cable leads to a small box, on top of which the air or wind god, Heh, is kneeling. A frog-headed goddess with two sharp knives stands nearby. This relief holds an important key to our mystery. Mural from the Temple of Hathor at Denderah."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 23 Though the cult of Hathor was enormously powerful for several thousand years, the Hathor temple at Denderah was not built until between 54 BC and 60 AD -- roughly the time of Jesus. Likely, it was built on the pad of a former temple. The ancient Egyptians honored a tradition that asserted that no site was sacred unless it had been built upon the foundations of an earlier sacred site. 10 The Hathor Temple was the earthly home of the original genetrix, Queen, or Great Mother, Isis-Hathor, who was addressed as the One Who Comes in Peace. This accounts for her title Mediatrix, meaning “mediator” or “peacemaker.” A Mediatrix is an intercessor, a mediator between two realms, in particular between Heaven and Earth. Contrary to today’s standards, “Peace” is not the absence of conflict between territorial, oil-hungry governments or jealous religions. Peace, to the prophets, is the unity of Heaven and Earth. The Hermetic Texts overtly describe Egypt as ‘an image of heaven’, as ‘the sanctuary of the cosmos’, and as the land where ‘all the operations of the powers which rule and world in Heaven have been transferred to earth below’. 11 In other words, it was a ‘docking station’ where Heaven and Earth connected. In addition to Mediatrix, Isis-Hathor was also known as the goddess of love and joy, “the beloved of the gods,” and the eternal savior of the human race. To be initiated into the holy science of her cult of love brought a privileged status after death. 12 Numerous theories have been put forward to explain the Denderah murals: electricity and cathode ray tubes, the forerunners for today’s computer screens are by far the most popular. These interpretations are instructive and possibly accurate. However, they do not take into account the Peacemaking role of this goddess. Nor to they take into account the puns intended by the serpent, including the serpent as a symbol for souls, wisdom or enlightenment. Aristides, a Roman who was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis-Hathor, spoke of a mystical experience during which he saw, coming from Isis, “a Light and other unutterable things conducing"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 24 to salvation.” 13 I have taken the liberty of calling this Light the Mediatrix Transmission or the Manna Transmission. Since Denderah was dedicated to the Mediatrix, it seems safe to say the ‘lost’ science portrayed in the crypt is the science of Manna. In this light, the Denderah reliefs appear to encode instructions whereby individuals can retrieve or turn on within themselves a special Light transmitted from Heaven and connect Heaven and Earth. I’ll expand on this subject in coming chapters, for I believe the Denderah complex holds a key to understanding the Cloak of the Illuminati. Now, more than ever, Peacemakers must claim their power tools and put on their cloaks of light. There is a powerful connection between America (the New Atlantis) and the Mediatrix, the feminine Holy Spirit also known as Sophia . In 1854 the Jesuit-inspired Pope Pius IX issued a papal bull entitled Ineffabilis Deus (“God indescribable”) declaring Mary to be ‘immaculately conceived’ as well as ‘immaculately conceiving’. The Immaculate Conception was now doctrine. Another bull followed sixteen years later that declared the infallibility of the pope, making it impossible to challenge the Church on any article of dogma. As noted by F. Tupper Saussy , 14 Ineffabilis Deus apparently mobilized the United States Congress to pass Mediatrix inspired legislation. Within days of the Immaculate Conception encyclical legislation was rushed through Congress that intertwined the symbolism of the Mediatrix and the Authorized Symbol of American Heritage, a statue of the goddess Persephone/Kore placed on the cupola of the Capitol’s dome. Since another of Persephone’s names was Libera (“Liberty,” “Tula”), Thomas Crawford, the sculptor of the American image, named his Persephone “Freedom.” The United States is a Mary nation. It is no wonder that a copy of her rod was built here. Abraham Lincoln’s War Department engineered the placement of Persephone on the dome in November 1863. It is fitting that the goddess Kore (Tula) stands on top of the dome. On the inside of the dome is the Apotheosis of Washington .

Thomas Crawford – like George Washington – was a Mason. 15 While it may sound utterly weird (or utterly beautiful), it appears that George Washington’s America was once the original land of the Grail. The Three Wise Men were returning these secrets to the New Atlantis, specifically its ‘Meru center’ Nashville. Interestingly, the Tennessee State Capitol building which sits atop a mound at the base of the Capitol Mall was designed by William Strickland, an associate of the Illuminist Thomas Jefferson (whose occult book is written in the Masonry of Monticello, the University of Virginia, and the layout of Washington DC). 16 He came to Nashville from Philadelphia just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War to build the Greek Revival temple as a symbol of a new golden age for the state’s acropolis or Ak-ropolis , the Sun Stone. 17 A Catholic church was torn down to make way for the new temple, which sits atop an artificially tiered mound strikingly reminiscent of the Teotihuacan temple complex in Mexico City as well as Glastonbury Tor in England.

Looking from Capitol Hill in any direction, we see other beautiful hills. They seem to make a circle around the city. Long before modern times the site of the Mall had been a place of enormous repute. Allegedly, in twelfth century AD the Welsh prince Madoc (or Mora-doch) visited this knob. He was in search of blue-eyed, white skinned Indians called Mandans -- the Men of Dan, meaning “wisdom” or An, “light” -- whom he expected to be living there. The linguistic similarity of their name suggested that the Mandan were one in the same as the Mandaeans followers of John the Baptist.

The thought of primitive Christians in Nashville before Columbus arrived in America in 1492 AD is ridiculous to some. This may seem to be an insubstantial “lost tribe” myth until one considers a modern day popular religion, Mormonism. Mormonism is founded upon the revelation to Joseph Smith of a set of golden tablets by the angel Moroni ( Meru-ni ) who had once been a human prophet to the great cities of Central America said to have been founded by refugees from Nimrod’s Tower of Babel fiasco (Bab-El means “the gate of god” and also “confusion”). This tower, as we will see, was fashioned after Meru. One of my guests on the Long Walk was a shaman from the Yucatan who had done decades of research on Mayan temples and Mormon history. He concluded that the tablets of Moroni had been housed in Nashville at one time. Further, he claimed Nashville is the new City of Light. He had come to Nashville to investigate his findings. This gentleman brought a crystal skull to Nashville with him. This skull came to have synchronistic meaning during our Walk after I noted the mystery of the Great Seal of Nashville-Davidson and its depiction of an Indian holding a Rod or Spear and a Skull , looking thoughtfully into the skull ala William Shakespeare’s (Francis Bacon’s) Hamlet. The seal of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County was created with the formation of Nashville’s Metro government in 1963. The new seal represents the combination of the Nashville city seal and the Davidson County logo. The meaning of the Indian holding the Spear and Skull is a mystery. Nashville’s fourth mayor, John T.

In the 1780’s Oconostota battled John Sevier over a ceremonial center called “Old Stone Fort,” near Manchester, Tennessee and Tullahoma, the “city of the golden flowers,” near Nashville. Formed by high bluffs and twenty-foot walls of stone, Old Stone Fort’s fifty acres was also protected by a moat twelve hundred feet long. In a story recounted by Smithsonian historian Roger G. Kennedy, 20 during a lull in the fighting Sevier asked Oconostota who built the mound and fortified ceremonial center (an astronomical observatory that resembles Stone Henge in England) over which they were fighting. Oconostota obliged. He told him the legend of Welsh Prince Madoc (or Merodoc) and the White Indians (the Mandan), one of America’s oldest legends.

A slightly different angle on this Seal comes when we consider the Nashville Mandaean/Mandan connection with this Seal. The link is the Templar Johanites who traced their origins to the Mandaeans. This order of Templar Mandaeans claimed a direct line of transmission from John the Baptist, who they said was the true Christ. They also claimed Mary Magdalene would be the Mediatrix for the New Age. They revered a secret skull or ‘head’ called the ‘dead head’ . In my opinion, this skull is a symbol for a skill traced to the Kanobi, who called it Chrestos . Nicholas Roerich was a master at communicating through ancient symbols. Both thieves and conquerors often seize symbols, he knew. Politically they are of great importance because of the feelings attached to them. Churchill’s famous ‘V’ for victory symbol is a classic example. It is a goddess symbol that stands for the Grail vessel. The Druids (‘wise men of Ru’) adopted it. Roerich knew that symbols also encode a secret sacred science of the Illuminati. Roerich had high political aspirations. His Roerich Peace Pact and its symbol, , was his calling card. Just as the humanitarian purpose of the Red Cross is embodied in a protective sign and banner, this distinctive Banner of Peace, flown at all sites of cultural activity and historical value, would declare them neutral, independent of combatant forces during wartime.

Most importantly, as far as our search is concerned, the three- sphere configuration is the symbol for the fifth essence or quintessence , 23 also called wood, or the Word , the exotic ‘black’ (hidden, occult ) pure mother substance upon which the World is built. Jesus is often called the Word made flesh. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and God is Love. The three-sphere cluster later became cryptograms that were extremely important to the Essenes and the Gnostic Grail heretics, including the Cathars (Kathars) and Mandan, which they held sacred and secret. Thus, the Roerich symbol and its derivatives, appears to be the symbol for the Meru Axis of Love. Another person deeply interested in the secrets of the Mandan was the Illuminist Thomas Jefferson. As president Jefferson sent Lewis & Clarke in search of the Mandan’s mounds and his Celtic Druid ancestors. 24 Notably, Jefferson was also interested in the Cathars. He visited the Languedoc region of Southern France, the home of the Cathars in the spring of 1787. 25 The Cathars claimed to possess a secret symbol system of the Kanobi they learned from Jesus. This secret language is an Illuminist’s dream. Historians who call him the Father of American Cryptography note Jefferson’s deep personal interest in secret languages. 26 Dr. H. Spencer Lewis, a turn of the twentieth century Rosicrucian author, claims to have found among Jefferson’s salvaged personal notebooks “some strange-looking characters” that previous biographers had taken to be code Jefferson had invented. 27 These inscriptions bear striking resemblance to the runes. More provocatively, according to Spence, they also resemble a Rosicrucian code in use before the time of Jefferson. There is little to wonder why the symbols matched. Jefferson, it is claimed, was a Rosicrucian and Illuminati. Out of all his 6,400 books, Jefferson said he knew of no better teacher than a good dictionary. 28 He accumulated linguistic records"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 32 throughout his life. Bear in mind the Rosicrucians believed they were reviving Egyptian (possibly Atlantean) teachings. Before and during his presidency Jefferson spent considerable time researching the language of the Indians of Northeastern America and comparing them with North African (including Egyptian) languages in hopes of discovering a connection between America and Egypt. History knows very little of what Jefferson discovered in his search to connect America with Egypt. His trunk containing his life’s work in this area was stolen while en route to Monticello after his presidency. Finding nothing of apparent value, the thief threw the trunk in the James River. Friends rescued a few of the manuscripts that washed to shore, and sent them to the genius scholar muddy and smeared. 29 The evidence of his Rosicrucian background is enough to make one wonder if Jefferson had stumbled upon any of the Cathar secrets while in the Languedoc. Did he learn the secret symbols of the Kanobi and Jesus? Interestingly, Cathar watermarks showed a serpent hanging on a cross spitting the Word symbol . In Egypt the sacred Ox (Ax, or Oc, ‘light’, in the Languedoc) was known as APIS, the Bull, i.e. OPIS , the All-Seeing Illuminati Eye of Light. Symbolically, the Cathar drawing duplicated on the next page is a cross, pole, pillar or axis linking it with the Meru Axis of Love. The Languedoc region is on the ‘pearl necklace’ of sacred sites that ring the planet and includes Nashville and Mongolia.

MANNA According to the mystics, the properties of the manna theoretically produced by the Meru super-antenna are mind- boggling. One instantly knows all languages including the universal Language of the Birds or Angels. They become psychic. They can tune into the thoughts and emotions of anyone anywhere in the world. They can remote view anyone or anything, anywhere. They become healers. In a word, they become angelic. The existence, or the belief in the existence of such a force or transmission of healing energy, is known throughout time and almost always is spoken of in spiritual terms. It is apparent from descriptions that the manna ‘came down from Heaven’. The Bible, too, confirms this. In Psalm 78:24, for example, manna is referred to as ‘the grain of Heaven’ and ‘the food of angels’. And in Nehemiah 9:15, manna is referred to as ‘bread from heaven’. In Egypt manna was always depicted as a conical cake or a semicircle . This metallic heaven-sent bread, notes Laurence Gardner, 1 was used to feed the Light body, as against the physical body, and the Light body (the Egyptian KA) was deemed to be the consciousness. As far back as 2200 BC, the pharaohs were using this supplement to enhance their pituitary and pineal activity, thereby activating their mental ability - but only the Skilled Ones (the alchemists with the secrets of the skill/skull ) of the mystery schools knew the secret of its manufacture. Nearly all languages had a cognate of this word, the basic meaning of which was ma-ternal, ma-gic, supernatural ma-gnetic force and a title of the Mediatrix, Ma-Ma or Queen of Heaven, who was known as the Lady of the Mill."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 36 The Polynesians of Easter Island believed it was the trained force of manna, the mental transmission of force, of their king that moved the huge stone statues. Gnostics said manna is the “divine spirit in man.” This later appears as the White Stone of Manna offered by Jesus in the Book of Revelation. “To him that overcometh will I give to eat the Hidden Manna , and will give him a White Stone , and in the stone a new name.” 2 This new name ( Word , vibration ) is written on Jesus’ thigh ( mero in Greek). This Manna Stone is equivalent to the body of Christ as described in the gospel of John 6:51. In Christian terms this is the host , the Lord , who is the Bread-maker, or Bread- giver. 3 It is one half of the Holy Grail equation, which includes the cup of wine and the wafer of bread called the host, symbolized by the . This White (or Pure) Stone can transmute any element. It transmits purity to all it touches. It can cure any disease, instantly. The Gnostics, including the Cathars, believed that human souls were confined in the body as in a prison. Their sufferings would end once they passed to a higher form of existence. The White or pure manna Stone brought about their katharsis or purification, and their enlightenment. All this power leaves little to wonder why in place of the sacred science of angels and the means to transform the human body, a crummy wafer and cheap wine were substituted for the true manna in Christian communion ceremonies. It also explains why the true potential of the Meru Axis of Love would be kept secret. After several ensuing years of research, I cannot say for certain if a working model of an ‘manna antenna’ of the Meru design actually existed in the ancient world whether in Sumeria (Iraq), India or Mongolia, or the Languedoc. Critics argue that my antenna theory is based solely on the right brained “looks like - was then” method otherwise known as poetic license.

There is not the smallest suggestion, say right-minded observers, which could justify an interpretation as an Illuminist’s secret garden in the texts. The function of this place is purely mundane. Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt have nothing to do with it. On one level the critical may be correct in their assessment of this place. However, they fail to realize that they are being shown a key to a spiritual mystery passed along for centuries. If the similarity between the pillars cannot be explained by architectural intention, how then, do we account for it? Pure Chance? Synchronicity? Divine Intervention? This would not be surprising. The Illuminati of ancient cultures, such as the Sumerians and the Egyptians, made profuse use of bird-brained symbol play, wordplay, puns and puzzles to express significant spiritual principles. Some symbols are made to symbolize other symbols. Words have multiple levels of meaning. Both are like round smoke rings when they leave the mouth. One can touch the ring of a word or symbol – especially a living symbol as, for example, the Meru Pillar – and enter into a web of relationships. My sense is that the Meru pillar is not looked upon as an idol but as a symbol or a banner for an ideal, which is similar to the Serpent Pole of the Jews lifted by Moses or the Christian Cross. Its appearance whether in stone, wood or paper is a flag, a signal or marker. It sends a message, a tantalizing invitation to a larger mystery similar to the golden thread pulled by Gnostic poet/artist William Blake that led to Jerusalem’s wall. This book should be seen as an invitation to an exploration rather than as a set of answers. More than likely the Meru pillar is a mandala (a shortened form of manna-dala ) or schematic or blueprint whose symbols point to the function of the actual thing. Mandalas are “read” or memorized for visualization during meditation... in order to"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 38 transform one into a Meru pillar , pole or Axis of Love. They are most commonly seen in two-dimensional form. They are blueprints of the three-dimensional palace of the deity, including the architectural design and many of the decorative details. Every detail of the blueprint is a symbol representing an aspect of the teaching. 4 The purpose of the mandala is two-fold: to acquaint the student with the symbols of the deity (i.e. Buddha, Christ) and to allow the student to “enter into the mandala”; that is, to enter the frequency or vibration in which the deity lives. The texts indicate that the mandala can be drawn, painted, made of particles, or constructed by meditative concentration. There are also two and three-dimensional mandalas constructed out of wood, metal, or other solid materials such as plants and trees like the Capitol Mall. There are two types of meditation mandalas, which are constructed in the mind of the student. In one, the practioner visualizes the entire mandala in miniature. The other, the most advanced tantric practice, known as “actualizing the mandala,” requires the reorientation of the subtle energies of the body to conform to those of the deity. In other words, it requires putting on the ‘skin’ or ‘garment” of the deity, what I call the Cloak of the Illuminati. The Meru mandala (including the Nashville garden) provides the instructions for doing so. Meru myth is permeated by the mystique of the number seven. Mount Meru has seven levels. The seven stars of the Big Dipper or the Plough were called Meru . Jesus, the son of Mary (Mari or Meru) holds seven stars in his hand when he appears to John in the Book of Revelation, suggesting he is holding the Meru Pillar (as in the Coptic illustration shown previously). In the East, the seven stars are found within the human body. They are the seven hidden levels of mystical physiology known as “chakras,” and located at intervals along the spine.

Winding around them are the two serpents of the Kaduceus rod of Meru -cury, the Roman name for the Holy Spirit. The seven gates correspond with the seven bodily endocrine centers. An endocrine gland is one that secretes chemical substances (hormones) directly into the blood stream. Scientists have discovered that this system can be tuned to resonate at specific frequencies or tones, as for example, with tuning forks. Many researchers give the ancients credit for an acute understanding of subtle magnetic currents of the Earth, and the collection of subtle currents or ‘keys of life’ sent from space...in the human body. The endocrine system is the ‘conduit’ between the earthly and the heavenly tunes. Their secret art and science was based upon understanding of the human body’s energetic composition and its ability to secrete hormones of life. In biology and physiology, secrete means to separate (a substance) from the circulating fluid, as the blood, sap, etc. and elaborate into a new product to be used by the organism and then discharged. This art and science centered upon the collection of these currents (star waves) to bring personal wellbeing and enlightenment (peace) that translated into a collective enlightenment (Peace). Peace is the unity of heaven and earth. Not, as some would believe, the absence of conflict between warring political factions or jealous religions. The artisans who practiced the ancient science now called geomancy collected the undulating magnetic currents of the Earth, nailing them to the cross with points of light called needles at specific places, creating sanctuaries of spiritual power. Serpents symbolized these currents. Their source was the center of our Milky Way galaxy .

Sophos , the Greek for Wisdom, and Sophia , the Virgin of Light, may be traced to ophis , the “light of ophis,” the Serpent. In the oriental language,” says 19 th century Druid scholar Godfrey Higgins, souph or wisdom meant also wool .” 1 From this sophia, wool or wisdom, came the hair, white as wool, of Jesus, who was called ‘wisdom’, the Golden Fleece sought by Jason and the Argonauts, and also the word Suphi or Sufi. During the period spanning the sixth through the eighteenth centuries, while Christianity was suffering its Dark Age, the Sufis, the mystical Muslims, of Baghdad built the city into a thriving intellectual and cultural center. Iraqis today look back on this period as the zenith of their Islamic past, when Arabic universities and libraries flourished, translating Greek texts into Arabic, and giving life to medical and mathematical texts that the medieval West ignored: the secrets of the Stone. Ultimately, the Golden Fleece symbolized, for the Illuminati, two treasures. The search for it by the Argonauts was seen as foreshadowing the “quest for the Holy Grail,” called the Stone of God by the Knights of the Round Stone/Table. The Holy Grail was in fact the Meru Axis of Love that produced the Eucharist; the body of Christ (the lamb) symbolized by a wafer (body) and wine (blood). On the other hand, for the alchemists the Argonaut’s quest stood for the search for the Stone of Destiny or the Philosopher’s Stone. This Stone was also Christ (the lamb) to the alchemists. The most important of the Sufi poets is Jalaluddin Rumi (d. 1273). Born to a noble family in Bactria (located in modern Afghanistan), he settled in Asia Minor (Iconium) where he taught, founded the Mevlevi Order (popularly known as the Whirling Dervishes), and wrote poetry in Persian.

In addition to being a cloak , the traditional interpretation of this word/symbol, in geology, the mantle is the soil covering the bedrock of the Earth. In anatomy the mantle is the cor tex, the thin layer of the cerebrum, the main part of the brain, which is divided into two hemispheres. In Matthew, 14 John the Baptist is made to be the reincarnated prophet Elijah. In II Kings, Elijah stood on the banks of the river Jordan and ‘took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters, and they were divided.’ 15 My interpretation suggests that the mantle he was wearing was the Cloak of the Illuminati made from manna in the soil at a specific site.

Without going into too much detail it should be observed that the instant the mother’s water breaks in the delivery room, and her cargo descends the birth canal, the newborn baby – the newly manufactured soul ark (the Argo ) -- comes under the jurisdiction of earthly Maritime Law, the “manufactured” law, or manufacturer’s law of the sea, as opposed to Natural Law, the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 50 spiritual laws of the Matrix that humankind must abide by. 2 Waiting for the (c)argo in the delivery room (“the berth,” or “the dock”) is a state-licensed doc(k) who examines the manifest being and certifies live birth. A certificate of live birth, or manifest , is written itemizing the details of the docking, as well as the condition of the cargo for presentation to officials. The baby (the ark or vessel) is given an identification number (an SS, Sailing Ship or Social Security number) that is used to track the soul as it sails the waters of earth life. The numbers on the back of the SS card are written in red, symbolic of blood. From the moment of birth, until its demise, the manifestation of the human biological machine is strictly regulated on Earth. The soul is given liberty, a granted privilege to go ashore, not freedom. The only real freedom the soul has is freedom to choose. The soul’s true freedom, its ability to perform miracles, is strictly prohibited. If it gets into trouble the accused soul finds itself in court standing on the dock . In America, the United States government claims title to the human biological transformational machine. It is considered chattel, property, and an asset in a vast production machine. Government authorities regulate all substances (energy) inputted into the five primary sensors of this boat of the soul that constitute its energetic make-up (a major control mechanism) and its output. Its anticipated consumption of resources and production of goods and services is calculated along with the cumulative tax ( dockage fee for use of the U.S. dock) it will pay; its value on the open market. This lump sum is mortgaged, pledged as collateral by the United States government to borrow money from financial interests (the International Monetary Fund). Eerily, all legal correspondence between the government of the United States and the soul-vessel-ark-container, the product, features the name of the person in capitol letters, just like the tombstone that marks the demise (sinking) of the vessel, and the discarding and recycling of the cargo.

No one can say for certain what the ultimate capabilities of the earthly ‘ship in a bottle’ truly are. It is cloaked in darkness. Society is oriented toward the suppression of human spiritual power, rather than the blossoming of its potential. Increasingly, our consciousness is being tuned to the all-fear, all-terror channel as if the generation of fear is humanity’s primary purpose. It is being fed (or feeding itself) a steady diet of terror to insure this is so. However, there is an alternative. The soul can overcome fear and alter the machine. It can put on the Cloak of the Illuminati. A key for doing so is found in Nashville in the design of the Illuminist’s secret garden, the Capitol Mall. Children play in the water gate. At the Capitol Mall the root chakra is marked by a crescent- shaped black stone water gate, and a bow of zigzagging fountains that children play in during the summer time; a perfect and poignant symbol of this chakra.

It provides a good strong support or anchor for the Axis of Love – the ‘mast’ of the ship. In certain mysteries, such as those of Mithras (the blueprint for Christianity’s mysteries), this gate is the door to life. It is the commencement of the soul’s ascent of the Ladder with seven gates (and above them an eighth gate). As the very base of the Axis of Love the water gate maintains a constant flow of energy. It is also capable of shooting bursts of power through the Axis. These bursts lay coiled like a serpent waiting the moment to shoot ( fire !). As this energy (‘living water’) shoots the Axis (the spinal cord) each endocrine center modifies and amplifies it. The Cloak unfurls in this manner. The Hebrew scribes recorded that their god “ divided the waters that were under the firmament from the waters that were above the firmament .” 3 The Mayan and Egyptian hieroglyph for water was a wavy line or zigzag symbolizing the waters of the sea. “He divided the waters.” This statement brings the water gate to life. Again, what do we see at the Mall but a perfectly positioned dividing line of water? When made visible on Earth, the serpent in the instant of manifestation is the sacred made manifest. For this reason the Mayas named the sea Canah , the Great and Powerful Serpent . 3 Le Plongeon states that among the Mayas the wavy-line hieroglyph was water terminated with the head of a snake.

The primordial connection between the serpent and the waves of energy of the cosmic ocean is without question a key source in explaining the origin of the universal use of the serpent as the symbol for healing wisdom. Cana (Kan means ‘serpent’) or KA-NA signifies “a dividing place” and Canaan is “a land of milk and honey” in the Bible. To the biochemist, then, the first miracle of Jesus according to John, that of changing water into wine at the marriage feast of Cana in Galilee is a literal anatomical process, taking place with every heartbeat in the human body. Galilee means a “circle.” In the human body it means a circle of water or blood – the circulatory system. This miracle takes place in the embryo when the soul parts or splits the waters of the sea of blood (the Red Sea) and begins to create the warm-blooded human being.

With the addition of human blood, consciousness moves from heredity (evolution) to environment -- from inward to outward perception. In this way blood acts as a mediator or mediatrix between Earth and Heaven. Each soul is a seed of the Source Tree. The ultimate act of consciousness is called Canonization in the Christian tradition. This is when one becomes a saint, effectively dividing or setting oneself apart from the rest of humanity. Canon is Greek for “measuring rod,” “rule.” Cannon , a hollow tube, pipe, gun (‘ shoot !’, ‘ fire !’) comes from the Greek kanon , from kane , a reed. Tula was called the place of ‘reeds’ (tubes, pipes). In Acts 2:4 the Apostles were recognized as canonized when a “flame of invisible light,” a lamp, appeared on top of their heads (as it did on the Buddhist bodhisattvas). This flame streaming from their heads signified super-intelligence and illumination . According to Webster’s , the word can- dor, honesty in expressing oneself, comes from candere , to shine. This is also the root of candle . In early Christian history, those who had received baptism were called illuminati and were given a lighted taper as a symbol of their spiritual enlightenment. The New Testament book of Hebrews states that at the first Covenant, performed in the portable (‘floating’) Tabernacle, there were a candlestick and a table with shewbread . 5 This is manna, one half of the Grail. Secret revealed the green silk on the table of the Tabernacle (the Grail castle ) represents green Earth. As Grail researcher Lee Perry notes, the golden threads sewn into the Grail arch-mardi (‘Arch of Mari or Meru’) represent the rays of the Healing Sun (Tula), which regenerate the Earth and produce the manna. 6 The candlestick is the Meru pillar. A candle is a flower of light. At the apex of nature’s electric system are flowers, nature’s candles. Just give a flower to a loved one to see the electricity flowers contain. They instantly produce a spiritual, mental and biological effect: a radiant smile, a ‘light’ from Heaven."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 55 Jesus was a flower among men whose blood, believers say, brought salvation. What differentiates the blood of Christ from normal human blood? What made it flower? How did he put on the Cloak? We will continue to look at the relationship of these two themes. They are the “whole shootin’ match” of our esoteric study, so to speak. Devoting attention to those prophetical words, blood and bloom , will shine light on (perhaps) darkened rooms within ourselves, until the dawn breaks and a new light flows through our veins and arises in our hearts. That we are examining this question at all is a powerful step toward putting on the Cloak of the Illuminati. Blood and bloom are associated in ancient texts, but rarely in modern spiritual conversation. Webster’s says the word blood came from the Middle English blowan , to flourish, bloom. 7 A soul’s ultimate quest is to spin the blood into the blood of Christ, symbolized by the flowering rod. The Meru rod provides a blueprint. This concept is present in a number of Essene texts immediately preceding and following the New Testament. It appears that the writers of the New Testament were aware of these texts, though they never refer to them explicitly in the Gospels. Nor do the Gospels provide instructions for altering the blood. References to the blood as a flower caused to bloom by a light appear only between the lines. Christ, the blood of life, is symbolized by a rose, the flower that takes its name from ros meaning Wisdom ( light ) and serpent , and is called Day, Dawn, Day-star, Day’s-Eye or daisy , the golden-eyed bloom. Like the Daisy in Europe Jesus is called the Marguerite, the Mari-Gold ( Meru-Gold ) or Gold-flower of the World. 8 From this word working we may speculate that one of the hidden capabilities of the human biological transformational apparatus is the creation of or ability to flow gold , represented by the Egyptians in this hieroglyph .

The entire underlying theory of alchemy is that something must be developed within and secreted from the human body, which will enable the seeker to make oneself over into a go(l)d. It is the Gift of God. As Fulcanelli said: ‘The secret of alchemy is that there exists a means of manipulating matter and energy so as to create what modern science calls a force field. This force field acts upon the observer and puts him in a privileged position in relation to the universe. From this privileged position he has access to realities that space and time, matter and energy, normally conceal from us. This is what we call the Great Work.’ 9 Fear and terror destabilize this ability. Christians draw inspiration from the statement that at the time of the second coming, we will all be shown a mystery; “We shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed , in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed .” 10 We will blossom. The word trump means in original Greek, a vibration, tone, wave, or reverberation. In angelic symbolism it represents the instrument that joins Heaven and Earth. 11 David’s harp is another example of such an instrument. (The modern-day HAARP antenna array in Alaska is a mythological match for this instrument.) As we will explore, humanity is in the process of changing itself physically, emotionally and spiritually to receive and live in a new Transmission. This is about more than becoming decorative blossoms. Activating our inner potential may be our only chance for evolution and survival.

It corresponds with the pubic region of the body. Fittingly, this chakra is marked by a square patch of grass at the Capitol Mall and a corresponding square area on the Meru drawing. The square is also a symbol of the goddess. Before the rise of Islam Byzantine writers regarded the worship of Aphrodite, goddess of love, at Mekka or ME-KA. The idol of the goddess was a white stone and that of her son was the small black cube now in the holy KA BA. Masons call this square the Stone Ashlar , the Freestone (a pun on Firestone , Phoenix Stone ?) as it comes out the quarry (the Cosmic Waters). It is on its way to becoming the White Stone or Pure Stone or Christ Stone ... Manna . Once properly squared the stone (or soul) is ready to be fitted for its place in the Temple (the galaxy at large). In the spiritual body the second chakra emits shining, translucent light in all directions. Hence, this chakra is about creativity. The holy of holies in Solomon’s Temple was constructed in the form of a cube. This room housed the Ark of the Covenant. Opening the second chakra the soul commences accumulating, absorbing and retaining information and experiences. It primes us to open the Pandora’s box, the Ark waiting in the solar plexus.

It is the circular area on the Meru drawing. In Nashville, the seven false doors of the amphitheater are a mystery. However, they are a common element in temples from Egypt to the Yucatan.

It made the Israelites feel invincible and through it God’s presence manifested in a cloud of Glory .

Located a few miles north of the Ile de Citie, the Abbey of St. Denis, patron saint of Paris, represents the effort of Abbot Suger, who envisioned the church as the center of a new illuminated Christianity. In his three books on the building and consecration of the church, the brilliant Abbot penned thirteen separate inscriptions celebrating the Holy Light. In one of these illustrious inscriptions, a verse inscribed on the golden doors of west façade Suger tells us: “Bright is the noble work, this work shining nobly/ Enlightens the mind so that it may travel through the true lights/To the True Light where Christ is the true door.” 7 From such words Suger developed his theory of lux continua , or continuous light. His aim was to bring the True Light of God into the world. Named after Denis the old abbey church of St. Denis had been completed in 775. The abbey had been founded in the seventh century by the Frankish king Dagobert in honor of Denis, and his legendary companions Rusticus and Eleutherius.

The presence of the Meru Pillar would explain one of the great mysteries of Solomon’s Temple: the incredible discrepancy between Solomon’s Temple I (950 BC) and Solomon’s Temple II ( c. 20 BC – 70 AD), built during the time of Jesus. The Bible calls the Mediatrix and her pillar Asherah or Ashtoreth , the Goddess worshipped by King Solomon (‘Peace’). 8 On one the height of the Porch is 30 cubits. 9 On the other (Jesus’) it is a massive 120 cubits high, 10 approximately as tall as a 22-story building. Accounting for this huge discrepancy has given biblical scholars headaches for centuries. Here is how scholars have reconciled the differences: 1). The discrepancy is ignored – the most popular way of “explaining” Bible difficulties. 2). The chronicler (probably the prophet Ezra), was under the influence of the prophetic bravado and exaggerated the Porch’s height in order to inflate the Jewish national ego. 3). The verse contains a typo. A scribe intended to write 20 cubits but wrote 120 instead. None of these explanations pass the “red face” or “straight face” test. This leaves the fourth explanation. Maybe the Porch was truly 120 cubits high, after all. If so, I believe the trail of research I have followed explains the discrepancy. The tall Porch was not dead space. The Porch was designed to house the Meru Axis of Love or the Ashera , the antenna of Osiris whose height was adjusted between 45 and 90 feet in various stories, and may even have had a height of up to twenty stories (approximately 180 feet). A Jewish legend supports my conclusion. The stone placed in the sanctuary of Solomon’s Temple II was supposed to have been the stone pillar that Jacob set up a Bethel after entering the terrible Gate to God and the Gate to Heaven. 11 The Ark of the Covenant was supposed to have rested upon this stone in the Temple II. 12 This puts the stone pillar or ATON Pillar and the Ark together."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 75 (The Islamic people believe that their famous temple at ME-KA is built over the same stone.)

She was the chief apostle of Jesus, who was sometimes called Jesus Ben Panther, or Jesus son of Pan -ther. 19 This name is believed by mystics to be a play on the Greek words pan and theos , meaning ‘ All the gods’, or rather, ‘the gods of the All’. In the Gospel of Thomas Jesus says: I am the light that is over all things. I am all: All come forth from me, And all attained to me. 20 The TET connection with the all and Jesus returns us to the bulb-shaped object and the snake at Denderah. As noted, this temple was built between 54 BC and 60 AD -- roughly the time of Jesus. An informative angle on the serpents of Denderah might come from the ancient linguist, poet, master of the pun, and holy man, King Solomon, who might observe that in Hebrew nahash is"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 77 the word for serpent and wisdom. The Hebrew word for soul is neshamah . Nahash also means blood. The linguistic and phonetic similarity of these words would force a question in Solomon’s poetic mind. Where we see the image of a serpent in the jar are we encouraged to take a leap of the imagination and see enlightened blood and souls? Do the tubes holding serpents at Denderah represent a ‘soul holder’ and ‘blood holder’? Is it a mandala for altering the blood through light? Is this serpent, in fact, a soul about to be implanted in the ‘patient’ on the operating table? In this light the Temple of Denderah emerges as a house of bread or a bethulahem . This would render Denderah as some form of a Roman era eugenics laboratory concerned with the transmission of genetic messages in an effort to produce a different or superior human, a god and goddess, or Illuminati. Jesus could, and would, have been one of its products. The All as a bread maker provides a powerful insight into the immaculate concept embedded in Jesus’ statement, and simultaneously the Illuminist’s garden in Nashville. Here’s another synchronicity. Nash or Nasht , the Arabic name for Meru , 21 is phonetically similar to najd or na- JED , having the meaning of “horn.” The phonetic equivalent to nash is found throughout the story of Moses, Osiris and Sinai (modeled after Meru), which is called by the Egyptians Mount Nissa or Nasha . 22 The brazen serpent lifted by Moses, ala the serpents at Denderah, was nis or nash , when the vowels are exchanged. Nash is Meru. This suggests that the Nashville pillar encodes the means to ‘lift the serpent’, or lift the djed . That is, it teaches us to lift the ‘head’ or skill of Christos.

THE HEART GATE Waiting beyond the water gate, the square, and the solar plexus (Ark) is the heart chakra. It is the bridge or ladder to our higher spiritual potential as it unites the earthly (“lower”) and the heavenly (“upper”) realms. At the Capitol Mall this bridge is marked by a walkway that cuts across the park. It is shaped like the letter H, a symbolic ladder. Along the west wing of the Mall runs a timeline etched in granite. The east wing has samples of all the flora of Tennessee. The timeline begins in 1996, Tennessee’s Bicentennial, and goes back to one billion years BC at the second chakra, the beginning of earth life.

Esoterically speaking, when we look into this magic mirror we see not only ourselves but also the hidden Christ, the primordial matter, within. We are reminded of I Corinthians 13:12: “For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face.” The Sanskrit name for this chakra is Visudda , which means pure. It is a source of protection against the powers of darkness. In The A ~ tomic Christ I discussed the startling synchronicities between the Holy Grail and the Manhattan Project, including the black stone. When the first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-No. 1 reactor, was finished in September 1941 it was an extremely pure carbon graphite column or pillar 3 by 3 by 8 feet assembled of thousands of black graphite blocks. In other words, it was a black stone. The first A-bomb lit up the sky from atop a one-hundred-foot steel tower at the Trinity Test Site (its code name) in the remote flats of Alamogordo Air Force Base called Jornade Del Muerto or “the Death Journey.” It exploded just below La Luz or “the Light,” in the desert lands of New Mexico or “New Place of the God of War.” Alamogordo is two hundred miles south of Los Alamos National Laboratories (code-named Shangrila ), itself in the shadows of the Sangre de Cristo or “Blood of Christ” mountains northeast of Santa Fe. It is due east of Los Cruces , “the Cross,” and two hundred miles west of Roswell “Fountain of Wisdom.” Many of these place names were named by the Spanish hundreds of years before the scientists came to Los Alamos.

Was this site selected by Grail synchronicity or by human design?"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 83 In Grail symbolism, the black sun, black stone or “hidden stone” represents the results of the transference of the secrets of God to man. In the Gospel of Thomas Jesus says: I am the light that is over all things. I am all: All come forth from me, And all attained to me. Split the wood, And I am there, Lift a stone, And you will find me there . 23 As all Grail questers learn, once the Grail Stone of God is ‘lifted’ (understood or stolen), the quester discovers this Stone is inscribed with a mystery teaching, which reveals the solutions to the riddles or secrets of creation and enables one to control the elements. This teaching enables the quester to ‘split the wood’. Following this linguistic path we discover the Greek word for (s)tone is Cephas or Kephas . Kephas is from Ke-phalos (phonetically Key-Phallus), meaning head . This is the original name for St. Peter (from petros , meaning ‘rock’), the Galilean fisherman who became Jesus’ chief disciple and the Head of the Catholic Church. By this interpretation, the Stone is the Head of the Church. To Christians, Christ, not Peter, is the head of the Church. Christ, we are forced to conclude, is therefore the Black Grail Sun Stone, key, and head, Henry Wallace awaited. When Jesus says ‘split the wood’, he may not be referring to splitting what we commonly know and experience as wood. The physical manifestation of wood only reflects the spiritual energy, or light, of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 84 which it is comprised. This spiritual energy is called the fifth element, wood . Because he was a master wood worker, Jesus was called a ‘carpenter’. The original Hebrew word for carpenter was naggar . It meant “fashioner”. To esotericists the actual wood this carpenter splits or fashions is the wisdom of the Word . The Gospel of John says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” 24 God is the Word and the Word is the a~tom, the ineffable, miraculous Life Force Energy, the wood, upon which the world is built. Jesus was called the second Adam (Adama-h) and “the Word made flesh.” Origen revealed his Egyptian worldview when he expressed that the world is a living being. “As our body while consisting of human members is yet held together by one soul,” he said, “so the universe is to be thought of as an immense living being which is held together by one soul, the power of the Word .” It is necessary to note here that the Greek New Testament describes Jesus not as a ‘carpenter’ but as a tekton . A tek-ton was a bridge builder or construction engineer. The Gospel of John affirms this builder or creator role saying, “all things were made through him”. In India, they say St. Issa (Jesus) called Earth a bridge. Interestingly, tekton can be applied to workers in wood as well as metal and stone, so it could mean that Jesus was a smith or a mason, that is a ‘son of MAY (love)’, the Pillar of Love or Axis of Love. There is a world of difference between the image of Jesus as a Galilean peasant man skilled at woodworking and Jesus as a gifted energy worker or alchemist skilled at fashioning light, perhaps even capable of fashioning light into a bridge linking Earth and Heaven. Bridging the enormous gap between the wood worker Jesus and the light worker Jesus who splits or fashions the Word , the Life Force energy upon which the World is built may be a third man.

Jesus responds, “ To you who has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables; so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand ...” This is quite a divisive or nuclear statement. It appears to be stating that there are two teachings of Jesus. Some may hear his words and faithfully recite them, but not fully understand what these words mean. Others split the words open and investigate their inner meaning. From this perspective Jesus is telling us that unless we make a leap from outside to inside, from ignorance to enlightenment further understanding of his secret inner teaching will remain concealed within the core meaning of his words. As with the choice between love and fear, there is no in-between. We either understand these inner teachings or we do not. We split the Word, and put on the Cloak of the Illuminati, or we do not. THE THIRD EYE The Court of Three Stars marks the brow or third eye chakra, the ajna or uraeus . The brow chakra orchestrates all that we have perceived in the lower chakras and weaves it into a symphony. At the Capitol Mall an electric organ commands the 95 bells housed in 50 twenty-five foot tall solid limestone pillars that frame the brow. The bells play The Tennessee Waltz every hour on the hour. The pillars have lightning rods attached to their tops. These appear to function as collectors of energy, radiating into the air. I enjoy visiting the Court of Three Stars at twilight. The complex is beautifully lit at night. A mystical silence rises over the place. It becomes an implanted cross of light.

In addition to Stonehenge, this stone circle corresponds to the ceremonial kivas of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico and the Cosmic Womb or navel. In Pueblo myth it is from the navel that the people first emerged into this world. It is a source of “blessings” which radiate outward. Early maps of Nashville showed all the pikes (the gates to Nashville) converge or emanate from the Court of Three Stars. I find it entertaining in the least, and illuminating at best, to compare this map with one of the earth navels of the Tewa ( Tula ) Indians. At the peak of Mt. Chicoma, sacred mountain of the West is a circle of stones with channels opening toward the Tewas Pueblos. At the center is a sipapu , a shallow depression signifying a place of access to the otherworlds. Jesus duplicated this feat at the Transfiguration during which he opened a gateway to this realm. During an early Walk with a group of Magdalene priestesses I learned that there is a mysterious railroad spike labeled ‘PK’ driven into the exact center of the Court. If one stands on that spike and utters a sound a bizarre slap-back or echo effect is experienced. Your voice is amplified tremendously in your head, but is heard at normal volume by those just a few feet away. Musicians marvel at this effect. To some, it’s downright spooky.

I find it interesting that this spike or PK is located at the peak of the complex. In Bali the pillar is called Sakria’s cone , the Budh or Bod , or Adam’s Peak . The peak was their Buddha, or wise pillar.

After rifling through my lecture pictures, he held up the transparency with the comparison of the Meru Pillars. “This one,” he said, pointing to the Meru drawing. “I design particle beam weapons for a living,” he said. “That’s a blueprint for a particle beam weapon.” How about that? He painted a clear picture in my mind of an amazing ancient (Atlantean?) science of pulse beam weapons. “See those two ‘thongs’ (what I think resemble ‘cow horns’ or the ilia bones of the pelvis) on the circular platform,” he said, squeezing his thumb and forefinger together to demonstrate, “those are pincers. They modulate the pulse beam you see emerging between them. The weapon is designed to rotate on the circular platform.” As he said this, images of Michael, the Angel of the Host, slaying dragons and all other enemies of God with a particle beam ‘sword’ filled my head. What was a blueprint for this device doing in a second century Chinese religious manuscript? As I concluded in The A ~ tomic Christ , I believe the Templar’s and FDR’s interest in the Grail was militaristic.

Charlemagne and Adolf Hitler sought the Grail for the same reason as FDR. With this knowledge one could build a weapon of mass destruction and unleash untold terror on the world.

Attached to the mill of the evangelists is a ploughshare that forms a letter ‘A’. As understood by the mystics A = A cone, mountain, or pyramid, the Primal Cause or Arche (AR KAY or AR KA).

We note that the Mill rests on a square or cube (symbol of Earth), matching the Meru drawings. In both the TET and the Mill drawings two figures are seen in the same position, both supporting the teaching, the Word or outcome of the drawing (the water gate at the Mall). An End-Time prophecy is given in Acts 2:17-18 that corresponds to the four evangelists pouring the Word into the Mill of the Host: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams .” Pour is the operative word in this prophecy. It means ‘to emit out of a vessel or into it’’, ‘to cause to flow in a continuous stream’, ‘to utter, to give vent, as under the influence of strong feeling; as to pour out words, prayers, or sighs’. At zero point, with Earth hanging in the balance, says this prophecy, the pure “Spirit” of prophecy and vision will be Transmitted to Earth and many will tune in to (pray upon) this stream and will see visions, dream prophetic dreams and will prophesy (see things hidden from others). The prophecy makes clear that this Transmission will shower upon the entire Earth...upon all flesh.

As we will"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 94 explore, receiving this Transmission will require a charged, and possibly, changed human body. It is no coincidence that his ‘new’ body is called the Host , or Body of Christ, since it is this Holy Spirit’s earthly vessel, its host. In times past this body was created through spiritual means. Stories of figures ‘putting on a garment’ referenced this transformation. Adam and Eve, Elijah, Jesus, to name a few put on garments of glory. Isaiah says that the blessed are to have “beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the skirt of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness .” 3 In the language of symbolism the four-tiered TET is equivalent to the four-armed or strutted cross + or Tree of Life upon which Jesus was crucified. 4 Tetra means “four.” The most sacred cross of Egypt was the ankh , the sign of life, the living, an oath, and the covenant. The top of this is the hieroglyphic Ru set upright on a Tau or T cross. The Ru is the door, gate, mouth, womb, and the place of outlet. It symbolizes revolution , a word-symbol pun for ring (a vibration or a key). The Aryans called the ‘A’ (or alpha ) the symbol of the Arr- God (Argot) the “stirrer up of the goddess, Terra ” (Earth). From terra there is derived tara , meaning compassion. Tor-ra means spinning door . According to a relevant myth, the Argo ( Arka ) or White Ship the Argonauts employed on their search for the Golden Fleece and the Wisdom of the Stone, was made of oak wood. 5 The Wisdom of the Stone is the successful transformation (milling) of human energy into the Cloak of the Illuminati. 6 It was only when I realized that MALL and MILL are interchangeable terms that I understood the true potential function of the oak-lined Tennessee Capitol Mall.

This indicates that the mill/mall is a TET Pillar, Tower or Cross of Light. According to the gospels, when Jesus hung upon the Cross of Light his body oozed the transformed blood and water that became the Grail substance, the host, manna.

This appears to be a code term for the Illuminati, the plowers (phlowers or flowers) of gold. He writes of the Word of God “turning the swords and spears of warfare into tools of peace, into ploughs that he himself has made.” 8 The Acts of Peter includes the plough ( aratrum ) in the list of Jesus’ titles. He is a plough wright. Iranaeus’ inspiration, Justin, lists the plough as interchangeable with the cosmic cross. 9 Justin in turn derived his interpretation from primitive Christian symbolism. 10 The early Christians, in turn, derived their knowledge from Egypt, who got if from Su-Meru (the Plough, Arktos ). A profound correspondence between the crucifixion pillar of Jesus and the TET Pillar of Osiris is found in the definition of the Greek word stau-ros . While unfamiliar to most modern Christians, it was the original Greek word used to describe the cross on which Jesus was crucified. It actually means the ‘pillar of wisdom’. 11 The word ‘cross’ did not appear in the gospels until after 600 AD when the doctrinal decisions of the Church councils began to take effect, obscuring the actual events of the crucifixion. Until that time none of the primitive Christian paintings in the Roman catacombs shows Jesus on the cross. Instead, the savior is represented by the figure of the lamb, sometimes holding a rod. This discrepancy is glaring. The mirror image of Stau-ros is Ros-tau . This is another word for the Giza pyramid complex, which was located at the end of the ‘sacred or royal road of the neters’ . 12 The ground plan of the three Giza pyramids mimic the pattern of the three stars of Orion’s Belt, making the Giza complex a ‘Court of Three Stars of Orion’. In Egypt, Osiris was the Lord of Ros-tau. 13 He was a green-faced god of gardening who was decapitated by his half-brother, Set (familiar to Christians as Satan). His decapitated head was housed in his pillar, the ‘ladder to heaven’. This ‘ladder’ is a symbol of that which must be ascended in order to reach the ‘reed’ ( rayed ) Fields of Peace. Like Jesus, Osiris was known as the Lord or King of Terror or Tara, Peace."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 97 Just as the cross is a symbolic substitute for the body of Christ, the TET is the body of Osiris. It is highly instructive to consider that Osiris was one of the earliest of the dying gods whose worshippers ate his body in the form of bread, confident that his sacrament would make them divinities in the afterlife by partaking of the divine essence called pais ( pace or peace ), the “essence of the Father.” He assembled a host or company of nine gods, called the TETI , Djedi or Jedi or “the stable ones” , with which he set forth to conquer the Earth, not with weapons, but with music and poetry. His ‘power bread’ fed his followers. Osiris’ first-born son was named Beba . 14 Interestingly, ba is interchangeable with and equivalent to pa (‘father’). For instance, ba is the Mayan word for father , and the Egyptian word for soul . Be is our verb to be , being , or live . Ba-be or baby is the soul’s power to live, and is the body and bread of Osiris through which he would conquer the Earth through music (peace tones). What we receive from this myth is the image of a gardener, or musician, who created an instrument -- the human body -- as a flow-er of his essence (tone), in order for his garden, the Earth, to bloom. Viewed through the lens of the myth of Osiris the plough idea and its symbolism become clearer. The plough gets rid of weeds: that is what it is for; it opens out the soil (soul) and cuts the noxious growths at their root. It ‘cuts up’ or ‘slays the soil’ in preparation for the seed. At the time of the second sowing, the Word-made-flesh has to root out the weeds of ignorance (sin) before transmitting the new seed. That is what the cross/Meru pillar is for, to destroy ignorance, and to transform one into Illuminati who dwells in the rays or vibration of Peace. A highly important story relative to these rays is conveyed in the Gospel of Luke. 15 Jesus was praying (bathing in the rays) in a certain place. When he finished, one of the disciples asked Jesus to “teach us to (p) ray , as John also taught his disciples.” As I think about this request, it seems like a bit of a slap in Jesus’ face. John had previously proclaimed Jesus the Christ. Here, a disciple is flatly saying they are not interested in his new, assuredly more advanced, teaching, they prefer the old-time prayer"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 98 technique of John. To me, this is akin to a person saying to Eddie Van Halen, “Ed, can you teach me to play guitar like Chuck Berry?” In response, Jesus utters the Lord’s Prayer. “Our father, who art in Heaven...” In the late 19 th century the British Museum’s great Egyptologist Sir E.A. Wallis Budge traced the origins of the opening line of the ‘Lord’s Prayer’, ‘our father who art in heaven’, to an ancient Egyptian prayer to Osiris-Amon. 18 This prayer begins ‘Amon, Amon who art in heaven...’ In many mythological systems the serpent is the symbol for “the hidden god” ( occult in Latin). In Egypt this was Amon or Amen , 16 one of whose hieroglyphs was a serpent in an oval, mirroring the filaments (fil- amen -ts) in the jars from Denderah, Egypt. It meant a pregnant belly. 18 The Hebrews and Christians adopted Amen to evoke divine response in prayer. This magic word was interpreted as “let it be” in Hebrew. A key word play is enfolded in the concept of the word amen . Amen or Imn became the Saxon Irmin (Hermen or Hermes), and Hermes means ‘ stone ’. Hermes was the Greek “god” who governed highways and roads. The Romans called him Mercury, the Holy Spirit . The word stone, in turn, is a pun for (s)tone or simply tone (aton). Following the path of this pun, amen points to the tone or frequency of God that makes things manifest, “let it be.” This, of course, is the Grail manna. These are the rays or tones Jesus was likely bathing in. This clearly indicates that the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ was in existence long before the time of Jesus and John. This is highly significant. It suggests that Jesus was quoting from an early Egyptian prayer to Osiris, and simultaneously, pointing to Denderah as a source of his illumination. It is pertinent to note that the Lord’s Prayer specifies, ‘Give us this day our daily bread’. This is often taken to relate to sustenance"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 99 in general terms, but in the original tradition the reference was more specifically directed to the enigmatic White Stone, manna . I am therefore interested in the prayer posture that is inferred in the disciple’s request of Jesus. If John initiated Jesus in the old- time religion of Osiris, he would have taught him the prayer posture encoded within his TET pillar. That is to say he would have instructed him in the means to receive the Transmission. Through this body posture -- the Y -- Moses served to create a conducting channel for the inflow of the power of the Holy Spirit to aid the Hebrews in their battle against darkness (ignorance). While Moses stood on a stone and assumed this body posture, Joshua was victorious over the Amalek. From this episode we may safely speculate that Moses, who was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, knew the secrets of Light. I have traced this ‘outstretched arms’ prayer posture to Atlas, the mighty man of Atlantis. In Greek times this body posture was believed to channel the sun’s ethereal radiance . This radiance came through the sun. However, it originated in the Central Healing Sun behind the Sun, the Galactic Core Tula. The invisible Spiritual body (the Egyptian KA), ‘the body of shadowless light’, said the Greeks, including Plutarch, absorbed this radiance. 19 Use of this prayer posture was called ‘ fire-blooming’ . 20 The radiance or essence channeled by this posture ‘burned’ (or ploughed) away impurities. The mystical schools propose, as does cutting-edge modern medicine, that healing comes from another spiritual dimension. When one has burned off impurities one becomes the purified person. They have put on the Cloak of the Illuminati. Fittingly, Atlas (A-Tulas), the first priest-king of Atlantis modeled this identical prayer posture.

Both were called “ vine ” and “ Tree of Life ”. There is profound significance in the use of the word neophyte (literally “new plant”) to describe newly baptized Christians, those uninitiated in their mysteries (of the Axis of Love). The allusion to the vine draws us to the early Hebrew belief that the vine was humankind’s greatest possession. 21 It possessed and insured life and made life worth living. Mark says that God was the man who planted the vine and who asked his son to visit his vineyard. 22 The followers of John the Baptist, the Mandaeans, used the word ‘vine’ not only to denote the Heaven-sent One, but also a whole series of beings from the upper world of light. 23 The Gospel writers employed the vine as a symbol of the Kingdom (government) of God and its ‘fruit’ the grapes or Blue Apples Eucharist. This point will take on great significance as we continue. Earlier, I noted Osiris’ companion, the Mediatrix Isis-Hathor. She was the provider of the Bread of Life, the manna , hence her title “Lady of the Mill.” One of her alternate names was Tau-eret , “the Great.” 24 Her son’s name was Horus. Interestingly, Arash , Harash or Haresh (Egyptian Horus ) is the Arabic for ploughshare . In Christian terms Hathor became Mary ( Mari ) whose son, Christ (the Holy Spirit) was a maker of ploughs and provider of the bread of the host.

THE MIRACLE GARMENT I find it exciting that the word pala-ough or plough shares the root for the name of the Garment of Life, also known as the PALA garment . In India PALA was designated the “Opener of the Way.” 1 According to Higgins, when a person was admitted to the highest degrees of the ancient mystery schools, s/he received the Pallium or sacred cloak made of white lamb’s wool (the symbol of wisdom) to convey illumination. 2 The white lamb’s wool is the Golden Fleece. From these early days it was passed along from Illuminist to Illuminist. For example, when Elijah left his prophetic power to Elisha, 3 he conferred it on him or installed him in his office, by the investiture of the Cloak of the Illuminati, or the Pallium . Joshua, Joseph, John the Baptist and apparently Jesus are Biblical figures who possessed this Cloak. Higgins mentions that this Cloak appears to be the remnant of an ancient superstition, the original meaning of which has probably been forgotten. If only Higgins could have shared in the discovery of The Goddess With a Vase Statue at the temple of Mari ( c. 2300 BC) in Syria in 1934. Then he would have known that the original meaning of the Cloak was not forgotten. It was part of the get-up worn by the gods who ‘go far into the universe’. The Syrian Mediatrix Mari (the Virgin Mary’s prototype) was one of the key figures to embody this Cloak. This goddess, whose name means ‘love’, possessed the tall Pillar of Meru. The Plough ( pala-ough ) is an alternate term for Meru . In Sumeria, the plow of the Lord (Baal Marduk) was called the Amurru and was called a hoe . It is represented as a long pillar standing on a dragon."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 104 The Pillar of Amurru (or Meru).

According to Sumerian myth, Mari (also known as Inanna) rescued this Tree of Life from the world flood and planted it in her garden at Mari where it became her Axis of Love. This Tree was a ladder connecting the underworld with Earth and the heavens, in other words it bonded Heaven and Earth. Her husband Yama, a serpent, lived in this pillar. Mr is a key tone at the root of this mystery. It is the Egyptian determinative for pyramid , i.e. door (or tor , mound). It is composed of the elements Ma – mother – and Ur – light, sound of Earth. Its determinative glyph is a cobra, the special keeper of concealed secrets , especially subterranean gold . 4 Tchet means literally “word,” but is used to express “matter.” As noted, mer means ‘love’ in Egyptian.

The arched serpent is the Egyptian symbol for bread. In English, Mr is pronounced mister . This is a word play on mist , the Egyptian name for the dew or wisdom of the Pillar of Osiris that rains (like manna) wisdom upon the initiate. In the Eluesinian mysteries the liberated soul was called a mysta . The Hebrew word a-dow , to wash, notes Max Freedom Long, is related to dew (vowels are interchangeable). The Egyptian hieroglyph mst (mist) resembles a three-fold fall of radiating water, and the pawnbroker’s symbol . It means “celestial tears” or “ dew ,” 5 and portrays three drops of water ( stars ) falling or radiating from Heaven. The same hieroglyphic also means “instruction,” or “teaching.” 6 Structurally, it matches the symbol of the Holy Spirit, the ‘fruit’ of the vine, and the triceps or tristar . Fascinatingly, dow is spelled Tau or Tao (pronounced ‘dow’) in China and means ‘Is-land’ and ‘Way’, an appellation of Christ. It also means cross. When Mari interacted with this pillar or pole and descended or crossed into the ‘ netherworld ’ or ‘ neter world ’ she prepared herself by putting on her PALA (“miracle” in Hebrew, “flesh” in Sanskrit) garment, her Shugurra helmet, and five other accoutrements. This ensemble is the complete Cloak of the Illuminati. In a statue shown here discovered at her temple/medical facility, Mari holds her Kaduceus Rod, Baton or Wand of Mari- cury or Meru-cury in her hand.

Zecharia Sitchin translates Shugurra as ‘that which makes go far into the universe’ , 7 suggesting that it helps her travel into the inner world or far into the universe. It may be more than eloquent coincidence, or sheer poetry, that Shu-gurr-a resolves to Sgr A , the radio source believed to lie at the exact Core of our galaxy, which was discovered in 1932, 8 two years before the discovery of Mari’s statue, the Goddess with a"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 110 Vase . This radio source resides beside a black hole of immense power and a theoretical white hole, a gusher of cosmic energy. Significantly, Mari’s crossing to neter-neter land, likely at the galactic center, Tula, is strikingly similar to the Transfiguration, where Jesus gained access to the Axis. Jesus invited three initiates (wise men) ‘to the high mountain’ (the Nob) where they saw his face suddenly shine like the sun and his clothes transform into a white light. Strangely, the Gospel/Oracle does not mention the name of the mountain of the Transfiguration, but according to tradition the mount where this event took place was called Mt. Tabor , which derives from tabb-ur meaning “navel”. 9 In other words, the Transfiguration or metamorphosis , as the Greek word means, takes place at the “center” or Mount Meru. This is reinforced by an abbreviated version of the word tabbur ; ta-ur , Cross of Light. Scholars are uncertain if this center was in Asia, Syria, Mongolia, Iraq or elsewhere. The initiates saw two men, Moses and Elijah, then a shining cloud (read UFO or vi-mana by some) come over him and from it they heard the voice of God acknowledge Jesus as His son. 10 Luke says the entourage entered the cloud/craft and then heard the voice. 11 When they came down from the mountain Jesus asked them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after his resurrection. As I have investigated elsewhere, and will explore in more detail in the pages to come, the myths and scripture of the ancient gods allude to their construction and use of wormholes. I have also interpreted the Crucifixion, Transfiguration, and Resurrection of Jesus as a stargate event. Despite the fact that the majority of Jesus’ disciples were illuminati of John the Baptist and were prepared to receive the thread of his teachings, many parables and signs of Jesus made no sense to them. This is because they are code. One key example is when he spoke of the ‘sign of Jonah’. Not one disciple seems to know he was talking about his Crucifixion, Transfiguration and Resurrection. “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 111 belly of the whale (the Fish , Ru in Egyptian); so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth .” 12 The heart is the center, M E-RU . In the myth of Jonah and the whale, Leviathon is the whale that swallows Jonah. He enters into a time of darkness, an intermediate realm often compared to a womb. Jonah is in the belly of the ‘whale’. Jonah’s whale is described in the Bible as a “fish.” This is attributed to the fact that the early Hebrews did not know that the whale is a mammal. 13 When Jonah went into the belly of the fish , symbolized by the uterine RU , for three days , 14 he prefigured the three days between Jesus’ death and resurrection. From our search, it makes perfect sense that the fish was the symbol for the gate to God . In the code, he is meandering through or crossing the arche waters of life. He is in the wormhole. In esoteric symbology the fish always refers to something that is secret or hidden. Fish are also the symbol of the Central American maize god. 15 The meal of fishes Jesus participated in with his disciples undoubtedly referred to the revelation of secret knowledge of the Cloak. 6 It was his understanding of this knowledge that gave him great spiritual power. It is my contention that his meal was made of grain grown in soil laced with the spiritual essence of Leviathon: the exotic matter of which wormholes are composed. This meal was milled within the body of Jesus. By this same serpent raised up on a staff within himself Moses performed his miracles, provided manna and holy water, and led the Israelites to the border of the Promised Land. By the same power within himself Jesus multiplied the loaves (of manna) and fishes, cured the sick, raised Lazarus from the tomb, and performed the miracle of Resurrection, Ascension and Transfiguration.

The mirror image of rk is kr or kore , which became chr which answers to core and choir , a song.) The Egyptian hieroglyph for neter , meaning gods or Watchers is the same as the almond-shaped fish, gate or doorway symbol of the Mediatrix Hathor and, later, Jesus. This is the ‘mouth’ of the serpent, and I propose, the wormhole. Curiously, this symbol resembles the Mayan symbol for the Milky Way (next page). It is duplicated in the Chinese character for visit and eye . In Sacred Geometry , Robert Lawlor notes the relationship of the ‘mouth’ ( mot , met , maat, matter ) symbol and the path of a vibrating string. 16 Each has a flattened, vesical form.

It matches the Egyptian symbol used for offering and bread . The Sumerians used it to depict Anu . 17 Their writing, called cuneiform means ‘wedge like’. 21 st century science tells us the fundamental building blocks of reality are vibrating “strings,” an idea that the ancients appear to have been familiar with. String theory is the idea that all matter is made out of tiny loops of vibrating string. How does this work? Atoms are made from electrons and the nucleus which if split consists of many other particles. These particles are made of quarks. In string theory quarks and electrons are nothing but tiny loops of vibrating string. Simply put, superstring theory says that all particles and forces are manifestations of different resonances of tiny one-dimensional strings (or possibly membranes) vibrating in ten dimensions. They’re so small our science and technology cannot detect them. Superstring theory further postulates that there are two types of strings -- strings with a clockwise vibration that live in a 10- dimensional space and strings with a counterclockwise vibration that live in a 26-dimensional space. Clockwise spirals symbolize water , power , and energy . The counterclockwise spiral , the Egyptian hieroglyph for thread , resembles a fetus.

The Sufis say it was the founder of their order, El Khidr , “the Green One,” whom they said was Elijah. 20 John the Baptist, said Jesus, was Elijah returned. 21 He is Hermes to the Greeks, the Guardian of the Green Ray and the Waters of Immortality. 10 The ‘gardener’ reference offers additional thought-provoking code.

Actually, Jonah’s whale is a re-tooled form of E.A., the Sumerian teacher of gardening, who was called Oannes , meaning ‘dove’, and the root of Jonah.

Is this actually a wormhole? An excellent next step toward elucidating the wormhole interpretation is the Hopi Indian creation myth that tells of a caretaker or gardener who was assigned to the Hopi to help them find their way into the Promised Land.

Leaving behind the evil of their civilization they began to climb (or drill) their way through the inside of this reed to a New World.

Tau , we have noted, also means ‘cross’ and ‘way’. It suggests to me that Massau led the Hopi to a tube that took them across galaxies. This may be the birth canal of the human female or something else. If this tube was a wormhole, symbolized by the serpent, the eating of bread and the putting on of a special garment appear to have preceded this experience. The connection between the manna, the serpent and the wormholes is affirmed by the Levites, who were assigned the sole rights to eat the sacred food ( manna ) offerings that were brought to the Tent of the Presence for the Sabbath. Their name comes from Leviathon, the whale or fish of Jonah and Jesus. This wormhole is otherwise known as LeV, Hebrew for ‘heart’, ‘love’, ATON, or La Vie, meaning ‘everlasting light’, ATON , and symbolized by the AV or simply V. If taken literally, the name of this elite spiritual family/task force of gurus who traveled with Moses (who magically transformed a rod into a serpent) and had authority over the other Hebrew people, suggests that they emerged from a tube or a serpent similar to the Hopi. This story makes sense only if the serpent is actually a wormhole. AV is probably the origin of the word nave and navel (‘center’, ‘Meru’), as well as naval (ship). ‘N’ means one. Reflecting the identity of the ship and receptacle is the English word vessel , meaning both a “container” and “ship.” The Latin for sheep is ovis , and for ship navis , the one avis or ophis , or serpent. The Greeks designated a temple and a ship by the same word, naus or naos . Nous is Greek for wisdom, another name for Jesus.

In the year 1058, a Christian Arab writer reported seeing the Shroud in Constantinople at the temple, the Hagia. 25 In 1157 an Icelandic abbot listed the relics of Constantinople, including “linen bands with the sveitaduk (sweat cloth) and a ‘ maetull ’ (or ME-Tula), the face of Christ.” During this time someone appears to have undone the gold trelliswork covering the cloth, unfolded the Shroud, and perhaps for the first time since Joseph of Arimathea wrapped Jesus in the cloth, unfolded it for view. While the Shroud (cloak) was unwrapped the Byzantines made at least three representations of the face of Christ as it appeared on the Shroud. These were called the Mandylion.

As I have proposed, the key to elucidating these secrets is found by interpreting Christ’s story in the Bird Language. We may need look no further than the Byzantine portrayals for direct evidence that Jesus used the Bird Language. According to Shroud researcher Ian Wilson, these portrayals show remarkable consistency in their markings including distinguished nose and mouth patterns, marked cheek detail, hair, beard, nostrils, mustache, blood stains in the hair and on the face. All of them have a common nonsensical non-physiologic object: a V just above the nose between the eyebrows! Shroud researchers have never interpreted the meaning of this distinctive marking. Is not this V exactly the O v O (or V ) marking of the Bird Goddess? What is it doing on Jesus’ forehead? Why was so much care taken to insure that it appeared? The answer is obvious. It was done to connect Jesus with the secrets of the Bird Goddess and the language of the secrets of creation, the Language of the Birds. It seems we have a powerful, perhaps irrefutable, symbolic match between Jesus and the Language of the Birds. Structurally, the V is a , the delta symbol for D, which stands for “door.” When combined with the Y it forms the , called the eye of the dragon . This is the uraeus seen projecting from the foreheads of the Egyptian pharaohs. The unusual, but unmistakable V marking, was first described in by French biologist Paul Vignon in the 1930’s, and is among 14 characteristic markings that help Shroud investigators identify face images based upon the ‘photograph’ of the face on the Shroud of Turin. In Deuteronomy 6:8, God commanded the Hebrews to “bind them (God’s words) as a sign in your hand, fix them as an emblem in your forehead.” I wonder if the patriarchal Hebrew God is secretly telling the Hebrews to learn the language of the Bird Goddess ... and ultimately the secrets of wormholes."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 136 This, I believe, is the meaning of the mark that appears in stylized form on the forehead of Jesus in the Byzantine portrayals derived from the Shroud of Turin. Numerous Egyptian sources identify the ship with the cosmic serpent – that is simultaneously the “pathway” upon which the boat sails. The Book of the Dead , for example, depicts the ship sailing over the “back” of the serpent-dragon Apepi (or Opi in the case of the Hopi). 27 This serpent/ship is an Ark, Arch or Bo. Readers who have followed or do follow my path of discovery will inevitably conclude, as I have, that wormholes are at the center of all myths and religions of humanity. They are also our future. Mayan prophecy interpreters say the technicians of the Yucatan predicted that in 2012 a “serpent rope” would open and nine enlightened beings from the center of our galaxy will emerge. 28 This prophecy comes to life when we replace the word “serpent rope” with the word “wormhole”. The Egyptian word for “company” is pauti or paut , which meant nine . The fact that a company of gods is represented by nine axes (flags) has led to the common belief that a company of the gods contained nine gods. 29 We are told that the king’s bread consists of “the word” of Seb ( Sab or Saba ) which comes from the mouth of nine male gods. 30 A double group of nine gods is frequently referred to, as for instance in Pepi I, line 273 where we read that “the two lips of Meri-Ra are the eighteen gods.” 31 We take two things from this.

THE FIG One of the finest examples of scripture telling of individuals putting on the Cloak of the Illuminati is the story of Enoch. Enoch, having been carried off into the heavens in a whirlwind from atop Mount Moriah (Mount Maya or Meru) in Jerusalem, is instructed that on the Day of Judgment “the righteous and elect ones shall rise from the earth and shall cease being of downcast face. They shall wear the garments of glory . These garments of yours shall become the garments of life from the Lord of the Spirits. Neither shall your garments wear out, nor your glory come to an end before the Lord of the Spirits” 1 This may be what Isaiah 2:4 refers to when he says the people will beat their swords into plowshares. Here, the apocalyptic transformation of the Earth, the matrix of life itself is associated with the people wearing magical garments of power ( pais or peace garments ) possessing glory, life, and imperishability. (What kind of garments, exactly, will these be?) The profoundly transformative nature of these cosmic garments is made absolutely clear in II Enoch , where Enoch, having ascended to the heavens, hears God say to the archangel Michael, the leader of the Heavenly Host, “Take Enoch, and extract (him) from the earthly clothing. And anoint him with the delightful oil , and put (him) into the clothes of glory.” The Essenes called this oil Chreston , Chrestus , Chrestos or Christos , meaning ‘good’, ‘health bestowing’. 2 Enoch’s description continues: “And Michael extracted me from my clothes.

As my exploration continued, I realized that all four drawings – the Meru Pillar, the Tennessee Capitol Mall, the Tet Pillar and the Mill of the Host – represented repositories for this same esoteric technology; a process occurring within the human body for transforming it into a Meru Axis of Love or Mill of the Host that secretes Chrestos and manna. Through proper understanding of the design and symbolism of the Axis of Love, and through the proper activation of the body centers associated with it, a ‘magician’ can transfigure or put on a spiritual garment ( the Cloak of the Illuminati ), like Enoch’s, Elijah’s, Mari’s and Jesus’, and utilize the energy emanating from the center of our Milky Way galaxy. This spiritual garment is necessary preparation for traveling via stargate or wormhole. We must eat the body of the serpent (the exotic matter of the wormhole) in order to travel through it. That Nashville, Tenne-ssee or Tenah-See should host this blueprint is apropos. It was the Tenah or Taneh , the “fig-tree” leaves that Adam and Eve applied to cover their nakedness after they acquired knowledge (Greek nous , noe ). The verb Tan also signifies “to lie down with,” “to bow down” “to copulate,” another of Adam and Eve’s infractions. 4 “Now learn a parable of the fig ,” Jesus taught in Matthew , 5 as he describes an End Time scenario. “Two shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken, the other left.” The Gospels says Jesus cursed the fig tree, which can only be the Pillar of Love. Church authorities probably inserted this story as a scarecrow device to thwart pretenders to the throne from looking to the pillar of the Goddess. In place of the wormhole science and the means to transform the body, a crummy wafer and cheap wine were substituted for the true manna in Christian communion ceremonies."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 139 Adam and Eve ‘grinding at the mill (or mall)’.

Bo means serpent, as in Bo-A or Boo-Ta. It is also a play on bow , meaning arch , ark (symbol of Mary) , ARKA and a rok , the Holy Spirit. The fruit of the fig was looked upon as a symbol for Mary or Mari’s uterus , a gateway. Ten , Tan , Tyne is usually acknowledged to be “ place ”. But it was often said to be more than this. TINA is also at the head of all words denoting the powers of heaven, including Tan-Tra , Ten- Tara ( Tantra ) or Denderah. 7 Babylonian icons showed the Great Goddess attended by her serpent, offering man the food of immortality, the manna. Three circles, rings or stars, a trefoil , symbolized this food of perfection. The Pyramid Texts said it was the serpent who offered the food of eternal life. 8 The Hindu sacred Mount Meru, whose summit towered into the golden light of Heaven, is said to have been guarded by a dreadful serpent or dragon (Draco), home of the star Thuban, the northern pole star in the Pyramid Age. 9 Gnostic texts said this serpent was the Goddess herself. They used the Aramaic pun identifying Eve, the Teacher, and the Serpent: Hawah , Mother of All Living; hawa , to instruct; and hewya , Serpent. Eve’s name in Arabic is a perfect combination of the concepts of “life” ( hayyat ) with the name of the serpent (Hayyat). Provocatively, from the perspective of Earth’s orbit the Meru pillar in Nashville is guarded by a serpent, the ancient and mysterious Serpent Mound, approximately two hundred fifty miles north in the Ohio Valley. Researcher Ross Hamilton has uncovered phenomenal secrets hidden within the earthworks of Serpent Mound, including the possibility that it was the center of Pythagoras’ cult of the serpent. 10 How coincidental is it that these"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 141 two complexes should share such a close proximity, relatively speaking? According to Hebrew legend, this (serpent) rod was made from a branch on the Tree of Life that grew in the Garden of Eden (navel, center, Meru). Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus are all legendary holders of this knowledge, i.e. Peacemakers. The rod, called the key of life in Egypt, represents powerful physiological knowledge: the means to transform human blood into the wise, holy and pure blood of life (light) of the immortals. As Mssrs. Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln keenly observed in Holy Blood, Holy Grail , if one breaks the French word sangraal , “holy grail,” after the ‘g’ it renders the word as sang raal , which means “Royal Blood” in Old French. 11 Sang raal is easily rendered as Song Grail , the Song or Key of Life. The Cathars of Southern France possessed these secrets. Hundreds of thousands of them were murdered by the army of the Church to prevent the widespread use of their secrets. If one learns to attune the crystals in their blood (DNA) to the Holy Grail, or song Grail , ignorance disappears, enlightenment occurs. Thus, the Key of Life is a mystery teaching aimed at transforming human blood. Exoteric Christianity teaches that only Jesus possessed the royal blood or noble blood of Christ. As the Gnostics, including the Cathars, knew, this is a medical condition anyone can achieve. This belief is a rarely discussed facet of the Grail heresy. My hypothesis is that this noble blood gave one access to the Argo or White Ship. As noted, Webster’s says the word blood came from the Middle English blowan , to flourish, bloom. The soul’s ultimate quest is to spin the blood into the blood of Christ, symbolized by the flowering rod. This rod is the same as the “rod of Jesse.” Jesse means ‘fire’ and is the root for Essenes and Jesus . ‘Tennessee’ means ‘house (Den) of the Essee or Essenes’ . This is a critical observation.

When the Christos returns, he will set up his throne in Jerusalem (or Tula) atop Mount Moriah (or Meru), 12 the same place where Elijah was lifted into heaven in the whirlwind and Mohammad was lifted into heaven on the back of a Pegasus. At this time, it is thought that Elijah will return the Rod of Jesse -- a branch from the Tree of Life and the rod of iron of Revelation -- to the Christos. The Christos will seat himself on the Mercy Seat in the Holy of Holies on Mount Moriah. He will replace the Ark of the Covenant that had symbolized him, in the place where God is believed to have first walked with Adam and Eve, with a true Ark. Just as a branch from the Tree of Life was kept before the Ark, he will set the Rod of God before himself on the Throne of God, where the Tree of Life had grown in the Garden of Eden (Meru). My speculation is that this will occur in Nashville, where a copy of the Rod of God is imprinted like a 2,200 foot-long living computer chip planted on nineteen acres of Tennessee soil beside a mound upon which the state capitol building sits. This conclusion is supported by the mythology of the Serpent Queen worshipped by Solomon. THE SERPENT QUEEN I believe I have presented ample evidence that the Meru Pillars are antennas. From this brief exploration of Meru mythology they were designed to resonate with the energies of the Tula. In other words, they are manna transmitters.

This symbol was called the Asherah , which translates as “oak grove.” It was her rod of Peace. It was once housed in the City of Peace (‘Jerusalem’) atop Mount Moriah . 1 Kings 11:5 says Solomon (‘Peace’) turned his heart away from Yahweh and chose Astarte or As-Terror . According to Harold Bayley , 14 the Ashera (translated “grove”) was a phallic object used in connection with the worship of the goddess Astarte at Solomon’s Temple. The Ashera or Ashtoreth was an upright stem or pole . According to the Koran, Solomon’s wisdom was derived from his use of the punning Language of the Birds ( bards or poets), which is also called Argot . The Queen of Saba’s father taught him this language. By the linguistic rules of the Birds ( bud s or budd- has , ‘enlightened ones’) the Hebrew word nashama (soul) is interchangeable with nahash (serpent). Nahash resolves into on ach ash , the “One Great Light” or Mighty Ash. Nashville or Nahashville translates to the City of the Great Light or Ashera , Ashera or A –Sara . Interestingly, Sar is the Egyptian word for “Queen” and is the root for “serpent” (rendering Nashville as ‘serpent ville’). One of the meanings of the Hebrew nahash is “to become Wise”; and similarly sophos , the Greek for Wisdom , and Sophia, the Virgin of Light, may be traced to ophis , the “light of ophis ,” the Serpent. Significantly, the phallic pillar at the Nashville Mall is lined with oak trees, making it precisely an oak grove, or ashera . In fact, samples of all the flora of Tennessee is planted at the Capitol Mall. The Golden Fleece (the garment white as wool) of Jason (Jesus) and the Argonauts, we are told, was held to be a euphemism for that which overshadowed the “Grove.” 15 Another name for Astarte was Pallas-Athena, from Thenen , a serpent, dragon, a goddess of Light.

This Stone was also Christ (the lamb) to the alchemists. How the garment of a docile lamb can overshadow a mighty oak grove is a mystery. We may begin solving it by recalling that the Arabic word souph means wool and wisdom . The lamb was taken as the hieroglyph of the eternal wisdom or Word – the frequency, vibration or tone of life – emanating from the Galactic Core, the . An important Greek word is baitylos meaning ‘thunderstone’, ‘firestone’ (the stone of Atlantis) or ‘stone of Heaven’ (Tula). In Latin it is bae-tulus . Robert Temple traces the origin of this word to the Egyptian baa , ‘metallic substance’. Another provocative meaning of baa , which fits perfectly with our exploration, is ‘ the material of which heaven is supposed to be made ’. 17 Baa is, of course, the sound made by a lamb ( baa, baa ). It is the root of Baal , meaning ‘Lord’. The pun is illuminated. These holy (s)tones, symbolized by the lamb, radiated an essence that was imbued with extraordinary powers. This is the material, the manna, out of which the cloak of the Illuminati is woven.

Significantly, the ben ben – or ba n ba n -- is the phoenix or heron, the bird of Tula and the phoenix, the symbol of resurrection later applied to Jesus. The Sumerians called it a shem .

He maintains shamain is the “hammered out bracelet,” the asteroid belt. 18 Much of Sitchin’s thesis revolves around his unique interpretation of the Hebrew word shem . “Traditional” biblical authorities generally translate shem to mean “name”. Shem may also have meant “monument,” a physical artifact that bore the name of something to be remembered. According to Sitchin, shem originally signified not “name” or “renown,” but “ that which goes up ,” as in a spacecraft or rocketship. 19 He argues that shem meant “monument”, but that the monuments were copies of the rockets used by the ancient gods (the Illuminati)."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 148 Sitchin interprets this illustration as a rocket ship, like that used by the hero Gilgamesh to reach the Abode of the Gods.

All traces of an enlightenment teaching or suggestions that Shem was Illuminati have been erased. However, Shem was actually a title of the Egyptian priests of Ra (or la , light), who were allowed to wear the leopard or panther skin and called themselves Shem (or Shamanic ?) people. These priests are thought to have evolved from a class of Egyptian priestesses called shemat , or singing-mothers, who knew the hymns and words of power. They were called Shem-su Hor or Hathors . The story of these amazing beings, the Shemsu-Hor is worth a momentary look. The Royal Papyrus of Turin (written during the time of Ramses II) records that the reign of the Shemsu-hor stretches to remote antiquity (up to a fantastic 40,000 years). 20 These kings lists call the Shemsu-Hor Akhu , meaning ‘Transfigured Spirits’. Akhu is the plural of akh or ‘light’, inferring that the Shemsu-Hor were light beings. In other words, they are the Illuminati. Robert Bauval speculates that the Shemsu-Hor were ‘a lineage of real (and)... immensely powerful and enlightened individuals’, masters of the science of astronomy, whose purpose was ‘to bring fruition to a great cosmic blueprint’. 21 “In the religious literature of Ancient Egypt,” writes Andrew Collins, “they are said to have become the god’s mesniu , ‘workers of metal’, or blacksmiths’”. 22 The mesniu were blacksmiths or alchemists and priests of Isis. 23 Among other things, these angelic smiths fashioned weapons for Horus to maintain his supremacy. This is a key to this mystery. My premise is that through proper understanding of the design and symbolism of the Axis of Love, including the Shem, and through the proper performance of the ceremonies associated with it, an ‘illuminist’ can put on a spiritual garment ( the body of Christ ), and control the energy emanating from the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

NIMROD: THE MIGHTY MAN From my research into the exact nature of this Meru Axis and the Cloak, there emerged, a picture of the human body as an unfinished work of art and the picture of a ‘Mighty Man’, who, like Michael (and Mari/Inanna), is described as a warrior, a sage, an alchemist, a master of the elements, and as a bridge between Heaven and Earth, a Peacemaker or Mediatrix (a feminine mediator) in the case of Mari. Mighty Man is a nexus between man and the gods, a man-god. He achieves this status by putting on the Cloak of the Illuminati. One who achieved this status was Nimrod, who is referred to as a ‘Mighty One’. This phrase derives from the Hebrew word ‘gilor’ which means “tyrant”. Gilor is the phonetic root of gilory or glory . Nimrod is mentioned in the book of Genesis. 1 When humankind was establishing its kingdoms: Cush begot Nimrod; He was the first to be a Mighty Man in the land. Many legends have grown up around the name of Nimrod. His name appears to be a title. Nimrod is a Hebrew term. Nimrod was born in Sumeria, c. 2250 BC. Consequently, his birth name would have been Sumerian/Akkadian and not Hebrew. In post-biblical traditions, Nimrod, the inciter of “rebellion” who ruled Babel, was often identified as a giant, or Nefilim , 2 Anunnaki in Sumeria, equivalent to the Anakim of Deuteronomy, 3 and the Anak of Numbers. 4 He was the chief instigator of the tower of Babel. This was a human revolt or rebellion, which led to building a tower in the course of staging revenge against the Hebrew god Yahweh (the Sumerian god Enlil), lest he flood the world again. The tower was a symbol of worship and protection and became well known by many as the ziggurat of Etemenanki , in"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 152 honor of the Babylonian supreme god MARDUK; the god of Mars. It was built in imitation of Meru , the Axis of Love, with seven towers, one above the other, exactly as Indian priests had taught that Meru was constructed. 5 Nimrod believed it stood in the middle of the garden of paradise. This Axis or Tower of Meru (love) is the likely root of Nimrod’s name. In its elongated form it is Ni-Mero-dh or Ni- MERU-ROD. It is widely claimed that the character of Nimrod, briefly identified in the Bible as the evil founder of the Babylonian cities, is used as a generalization and personification of the entire Babylonian period, all members of the dynasty wrapped up and bundled under one name, Nimrod or Mighty Men of the Pillar of Meru, or the Illuminati. Each achievement of this civilization is attributed to him (and his mother) as part of his magical knowledge . The Tower of Babel symbolized this magical knowledge, which Yahweh preferred that humanity not have. Originally, babel meant ‘gate’ , a term that aligns it with my stargate or wormhole theory. Later, after their god Yahweh destroyed this tower, the Hebrew scribes said babel now meant ‘confusion’. A changing of the meaning of words, along with a changing of the gods, accompanied this squelched rebellion. The word tower is the same as the French tour , which also means a wheel , a ring , and it may be equated with the Gaelic tor , meaning a conical hill or a castle . The Egyptian for a fortress was t’ra . 6 This is Tura or Dura where Nebuchadnezzar constructed the 90-foot tall golden image in imitation of Nimrod. Allowing for the interchange of T and D, t’ra resolves into tura , tara or Tula, the home of the Illuminati.

The ‘skin’ referred to here is not clearly defined. One thing is clear, however. The ‘Mighty Skin’ was designed to provide power.

The cow is the symbol for Tula. In the photo from Howard Carter’s initial discovery of Tut’s nebris, is seen a squared “U” shaped artifact that is likely to be a seat for the nebris found right next to it. Oars lead a path to the nebris. Oars symbolize power, skill, and knowledge. It is the rod, ray, wand or spear, which stirs the primordial ocean, and also the pole which guides the Ship of the Dead ( Tet ) across the waters to the other shore. 9 It is also a symbol for the Word. 10 Thus, while outwardly it appears as a humble piece of King Tet’s equipment, the oar is a sign and symbol of sacred power. The purpose for the presence of oars may be to illustrate to the discoverer that the nebris is like a boat, i.e., that it is a vehicle powered by rays. The ancient Egyptian “Ship of Heaven” is found in some renditions in forms that suggest the same technology was applied to a number of Egyptian boats, often with tets or djed (batteries) toward either end, suggesting various electro-magnetic propulsion strategies, such as those proposed by Stanton Friedman. The fact that bread was also handled with paddles or oars may illustrate that the way of making and/or energizing the nebris may be in part something that resembles or pertains to the baking of bread, such as that one end be placed in proximity to a source of heat, since the oars were extended into ovens to introduce or remove loaves of bread. Bread is, of course, baked in a pan . Panacea means “ All - Healer,” and is the name of one of the daughters of Raya . She was called ‘ Acca, the Maker ’ in Rome, 11 and Akka in Sumer. As far as this exploration is concerned, Ak is perhaps the most important Egyptian word of all. It means light . R-ak means spirit .

Therefore, he must be ejected from the garden/womb at once, lest he “take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever’. 13 Yahweh proceeded to curse Eve, the mother of all living. Next, he made coats of skin, and clothed Adam and Eve. The Zohar says that, “When Adam dwelt in the garden of Eden (Meru, Eden and Atlantis are interchangeable terms), he was clothed in the celestial garment, which is the garment of heavenly light... light of that light which was used in the garden of Eden .” 14 This divinely provided skin transformed Adam and Eve from sinners into people of righteousness fit for God’s presence. Later, the ‘second Adam’, Jesus, took up this skin (of the Mighty Man) in the form of the seamless garment. When the Roman soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.” 15 In the Gnostic tradition the purpose of Earth life is to reclaim this Cloak of the Illuminati. The Druids, who drew from the traditions of Egypt and India, knew of this suit of the Mighty Man. One of my favorite myths of the Peacemakers comes from Celtic Ireland. It tells of the Druid shamans who were called bards (birds) or ollaves (which calls to mind the olive branch of peace) and were revered not just as poets, but also as Peacemakers. According to Irish tradition and the writings of Diodorous Siculus (pronounced Skill-Us), often on the battlefields, at the very moment when the armies approach each other with swords raised the bard (bird) would appear, speak a word of power and peace would immediately ensue. “It was if they had cast a spell over wild beasts,” wrote Siculus. Even the great Roman armies of the 600’s were filled with awe and terror at the sight of them.

When we follow this trail we are intrigued to find that the May Pole was the symbol of “the Lord of Life.” It was called “ the Column of May (Maya or Mari) . 16 May means love, and is related to Min , the root for min ister, a conduit between man and God. Minne was the name given to Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love ( Meru ), by the medieval Min strels or Minne singers, 17 the devotees of Mary Magdalene, another priestess of Mari , in southern France who introduced the Grail romances to the world. These wandering poets or bards said Minne meant Love . 18 The flowering White Thorn of which some believe Jesus’ crown was woven was plucked and worn in May. This led some to call his crown “May” (aligning it with the Shugurra helmet of Mari or Maya). 19 The May doubtless the “budding rod” of Moses and later became the Glastonbury Thorn , which British Christian legend says was the Staff, Rod, Banner or Kaduceus brought to England by Joseph of Arimathea after the Crucifixion.

Ninus is a name perhaps derived from the Assyrian nunu , meaning “fish,” , and is a reference to E.A. the Sumerian fish god who wore an amphibious suit, tended a pillar of light and brought the ME (pronounced MAY, meaning LOVE) tablets or stones containing the secret science of the gods to Earth. E.A. originally came to Earth in search of the “blue stones that cause ill”. 20 He founded the first civilization at Su-Meru. The blue stones appear to be enormously powerful orbs.

The spitting serpent appears in The Music of the Spheres figure on the next page. Apollo sits on his throne holding his lyre. Beside him are the Three Graces, performing their round dance for Apollo. A ‘serpent’ (rope) extends from Apollo’s throne to Earth. According to Joseph Campbell, the three heads at the base of the serpent represent the three Graces and the three temptations overcome by the Buddha in yoga at the foot of the Bodhi Tree: “desire” ( kama ), fear of “death” ( mara ), and attachment to earthly concerns (dharma ). The three-headed serpent-rope or serpent channel descending from Apollo is multi-leveled in its interpretation. The three-headed serpent is the Tree or Three of Life. It represents the shushumna, the current of life or chord of life , descending from Apollo, the crown shakra, down the spinal cord to the Root chakra located in the genitalia area. This spiritual energy lays asleep, coiled, like a dormant serpent (Sanskrit kundalini , “coiled serpent”), which is to be awakened and brought, uncoiling, up the Tree of Life to a radiant doorway at the crown of the head called “Thousand Petaled” ( sahasrara ).

At a given point little bells are rung, and censers (burning cannabis) swing before the altar.

As many researchers profess, Eden and Atlantis (Tula) are the same. E.A. is her serpent king (called Poseidon). The Gnostics called him ‘the Great Light’. In order to fully appreciate the story of Nimrod (and his successor Nebuchadnezzar) and his donning of the skin of the Mighty Man, which undoubtedly was engineered by E.A., let us briefly explore the story of E.A., its provider. E.A. is the great Anunnaki scientist featured in the Sumerian epic poems and romanticized in the works of Sitchin, 29 who maintains E.A. genetically modified the human race as a slave race to mine gold. He was opposed in this endeavor by his half-brother, Enlil, who responded to E.A.’s later transmutation of a select few of the human element into a god-like being by sending the Flood, wiping (most all of) them off the face of the Earth. E.A. and Enlil had been bitter rivals since before coming to Earth. Humanity became their new swords. E.A. and his priests, seek to uplift humanity to the level of the gods through global education and revelation of all sacred secrets. Enlil’s priests seek to keep humanity at the level of slaves and sex objects, the property of a police state cryptocracy. Enlil, called the “prince of Earth” whose command made the heavens tremble, 30 is militaristic, managerial, hands on, and totally opposite of E.A., the dreamer. He too bestowed a suit of the Mighty Man. He was furious at E.A. for creating this slave race (which he later turned into sex objects). He was threatened by the appearance of the super human. There is the interesting statement in the Popol Vuh which reflects Enlil’s thoughts on the matter of ‘his’ slaves who became perfect: “It is not well that our creatures should know all. Must they perchance be the equals of ourselves, their makers, who can see far, who know all and see all? ... Must they also be gods?” One ancient name for these beings is the Irish sidhe (pronounced ‘she’) people. They are considered to be direct descendents or reincarnations of the Illuminati. 31 Evans -Wentz"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 166 notes that these sidhe people are described as a race of majestic appearance and marvelous beauty, in form human, yet in nature divine. 32 They are divided into two classes: those which are shining, and those which are opalescent and seem lit up by a light within themselves. 15 The word sidh informs us of the nature of the forbidden teachings that E.A. desired to teach. Sidh appears to be related to the Latin sedes and the Sanskrit siddha , both words meaning power. The Sanskrit term siddhi carries the meanings “attainment,” “accomplishment,” or “perfection.” In the Hindu literature, this term is used to denote the abilities which self-realized or spiritually perfected individuals possess and use unselfishly. Scholars who have followed the ‘missing years’ of Jesus have shown that he received training in India from Hindu and Buddhist masters. They taught him yogic abilities called the ashta-siddhi . These eight powers are: 1. Animan, the ability to make oneself infinitely small in an instant; 2. Mahiman , the power to grow infinitely large at will; 3. Laghiman , or levitation, defying the law of gravity; 4. Prapti , the power to touch any object at any distant, such as scooping up a handful of dust on Mars; 5. Prakamya , the ability to dive into the solid ground and move about as if it were air or water; 6. Vashitva , total control over the elements; 7. Ishitritva , the ability to create or destroy matter; 8. Kamavasayitva , instant materialization of wishes. The Illuminati can achieve these powers by utilizing Buddha’s noble eight-fold path.

The blessed, we have noted, have “beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the skirt of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness .” They are called Skill(y) or Tula, both words mean “blessed.” In the gospels of Matthew and Luke, where the Sermon on the Mount is reported, the Greek word MAKARIOS is used. 33 This, obviously, is MAKARA . Appropriately, this term previously had been used to specifically denote the happiness of the gods . Those who follow in the footsteps of Jesus and put on the Cloak of the Illuminati, known as practicing the imitatio Christi , will have a foretaste of the heavenly bliss to come. According to Matthew’s version, the eight beatitudes are: 1. Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 2. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 3. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 4. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 5.

The possibility that his creation could have even exceeded his otherterrestrial overseers is evidenced by the statement of Jesus, “...he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father.” 35 This knowledge, and the abilities it represents, is the true reason Enlil, who became Yahweh in the Hebrew tradition, was so enraged and threatened."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 168 By this interpretation, E.A. was creating or activating a super race, remembered by the Essenes as ‘Kanobi’, and by other traditions in similar terms. They were the Mighty Men. The magic wand-like elegance of this hypothesis has been used to explain the lack of skeletal evidence between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens , a creature that in the twinkling of an eye, or the wave of a wand, developed a huge brain and vastly improved faculties. It also explains the legends of the lost super race. Sumerian lore makes it clear that E.A. put knowledge in human blood that transformed one into an El, Il or Illuminati. It is claimed that remnants of the purer pre-Flood race(s) created by E.A. exist in secret refuges, called the Mount of Salvation in the Grail romances, around the world. The vineyards of the Languedoc, including hyper-mysterious Rennes-le-Chateau are considered one of these locations. I have traced the secrets of E.A. there. According to Catharic belief, one object of Earth life was to make over the human body as a worthy vehicle for the light of the Holy Spirit (love). The point was to know the Grail not as a cup but as a process. Jesus was its modeler. Insight into this teaching radiates from the name of the Cathar’s home, the Languedoc . Named after the pre-Flood language system the Cathar priests claimed Jesus preached in -- the Language of Oc (possibly short for occamy , a corruption of alchemy) -- this place name is Cathar Jesus code. Webster’s says ‘Oc’ is the root of octo , 8, and ocular, the eye. A related Egyptian word, Ak , means ‘light’, and aker means ‘light being’. Ak-hu is the archetypal Cosmic Man of Light, or ideal archetype of humanity found in a host of Hermetic and Gnostic teachings, whether Egyptian, Jewish, Christian or Islamic. As Mircea Eliade notes in Shamanism , among the Iglulik Eskimos, who were driven out of some unknown homeland, a sequence of initiations concludes with the ang-ak-oq (virtually the same word as Languedoc or L’ang-ak-oq), meaning ‘lightening’ or ‘illumination’. 36 This angakoq, writes Eliade, consists of “ a mysterious light"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 169 which the shaman suddenly feels in his body, inside his head, within his brain, an inexplicable searchlight , a luminous fire which enables him to see with both eyes , both literally and metaphorically speaking, for he can now, even with closed eyes, see through darkness and perceive things and coming events which are hidden from others.” The emphasis here is on eyes and light. Enlightenment is exactly what the Cathars claimed they received from the highly symbolic Language of Oc. As an investigative mythologist, it is of great interest to me that the Egyptian hieroglyph of the heron/phoenix, , the ‘bird of light’ ( akh ), so closely matches the stylized fish glyph of Jesus , though it predates him by millennia. In addition, these two symbols are structurally identical to , the mathematical sign sometimes used for infinity, which spells OC .

In addition to Nefilim (a Hebrew word usually translated “giants” but also meaning “fallen ones”), they were called An-un- naki (“the 50 who went from Heaven to Earth”) by the Sumerians, a name that may be translated as ‘fish of light’, since a related Egyptian word, Ak , means ‘light’ and ‘serpent’, 38 and aker means ‘light being’.

They were very tall. They dwelled in a place called Eschol , a “land that eatheth the people up.” In the book of Numbers 13 Moses was leading the Israelites to the Promised Land.

In actuality, this was a search for the secrets of the Anunnaki, and E.A. One of Moses’ operatives was Joshua the “Son of Nun ,” meaning ‘fish’. In the protosiniatic Hebrew alphabet glyphs the letter nun was drawn as a serpent. Nun means eternally regenerating life (in cycles because of the serpent’s shedding of its skin as it grows) or immortality. Significantly, Joshua’s name is the same as the Greek ‘Yeshua’ or Jesus, who was symbolized by the fish glyph , thought to represent the opening of the uterus , the womb/door of life leading to the home of the gods. Along with a companion, Joshua (Jesus) was dispatched to the mysterious valley of Eschol (‘valley of the cluster’ as in grapes), where he spied on the sons of Anak who were living there. The sons of Anak or A-nun (the fish/serpent) are described not as humans but as giants ! “We saw the children of An-ak there”, the spies reported, “we saw the giants,” those men of a prodigious size, the “sons of An- ak,” which “come of the giants”. The Sumerians called these giants ( Nephilim in Hebrew) the A- nun -naki , which, literally translates as ‘fish/serpent of light’. From the description of their route given in Numbers and the length of their excursion (a ‘magical’ or initiatory forty days), it seems Joshua took a survey of a vast land, one larger than the Holy Land, which 24 people can reconnaissance in a lot less than forty days. In a daring story reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, we learn that when the spies left the vineyard of the giants they stole a branch heavy with the grapes of the Anunnaki. These grapes are so heavy it takes two men to carry them!(?) Yahweh had promised the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey. These grapes were certainly a healthy down payment!

The cities are impregnable fortresses; they “are walled,” and “very great”. But that’s not all. Even if they overcame the walls another even more terrifying (and, therefore to us, a more interesting) reason for staying out of the vineyards presented itself. Joshua saw that Eschol “ is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof ”. What does this mean?! Was a great plague in the vineyards? If so, why shroud this simple fact in obscure language? The Israelites had just escaped Egypt due to a plague sent from a helpful Yahweh. They certainly knew what a plague was. If Joshua saw an inner Earth opening that consumed people, he could easily have said he saw a cave. Another interpretation is that the land did not sustain its people. This contradicts the belief that this was the land of milk and honey. It would be easy to say the spies saw a space ship. If so, they could have said they saw a “cloud,” a term used dozens of times in the Bible during episodes that are strikingly similar to modern day UFO sightings. The phrase, “ the land eateth up the people thereof ” must, therefore, have a more phenomenal, even supernatural, explanation. What could it be? My research, developed in my books The Healing Sun Code , The Crystal Halls of Christ’s Court and Ark of the Christos reveals that we now have such a word: stargate or wormhole.

NEBUCHADNEZZAR’S GATE In the latter part of the sixth century BC, Nebuchadnezzar believed that he was acting as Nimrod (just as Saddam Hussein believed he assumed the mantle of Nebuchadnezzar). He established an empire in Babylon simulating Nimrod’s. It was the most powerful empire the ancient world had ever seen. Biblical prophecy says it will rise again only to be destroyed at the Day of the Lord. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel and John all prophesied extensively about the future of this magnificent empire. Nabuchadnezzar took his name from Nabu or Nebo , the Su- Merian son of Marduk or Mar.duk (son of the bright mound) (or Maltuuk in America, Ra in KMT/Egypt) also known as Michael. Marduk is the son of E.A. The Mandeans, early Iraqi Christians who upheld John the Baptist as the true Messiah, asserted that Jesus was Nabu, the false messiah, and the destroyer of the old orthodox religion; while other opponents said he was the founder of a new sect of Nazars (“Watchers”). An alternate name for the Nazars was Essenes , who called themselves Kanobi , meaning ‘serpents’. Kanobi and Nobi or Nebu appear to be the same. The Hebrew word naba means ‘to speak by inspiration’, and Nebo is the god of wisdom and also the planet Meru-cury. Nabu was the scribe and herald of the gods, god of writing and destiny; patron of scribes. He was the god of science and learning in Mesopotamia and the king’s protector. It was believed he could increase or decrease the number of days allotted to a person. Representing death and sterility, his symbols were a serpent- headed dragon , an engraving tablet and chisel. Wisdom, accounting, intellect, literature, speech, writing, intercession were his domains."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 176 The Hindus call this wise man Buddha; a contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar, and the planet Mercury is closely connected with the Buddha (‘awakened one’). Similarly, the Talmudists hold that the genius or Holy Ghost of Mercury inspired Jesus. According to the modern theosophical tradition, there is an intimate link between Jesus and Buddha, connected with Jesus’ status as an avatara. Some of Jesus’ sayings are copied word for word from sayings of Buddha/Nabu. Austrian archaeologists recently discovered the palace Nebuchadnezzar built for Nabu at Borsippa. The temple of Borsippa, 75 miles south of Baghdad, was constructed atop the ruins of a smaller tower from the second millennium BC. Wilfrid Allinger-Csollich of the University of Innsbruck said that of all the temple towers built during the Nebuchadnezzar’s 40-year reign, the Borsippa ziggurat has best survived the ravages of time. “ On top was Nabu’s residence with rooms for servants and priests and wings for his wife, Tachmitum, his children and daughters. It must have looked really fantastic,” said Helga Trenkwalder, leader of the seven-member Austrian team. 1 Being the residence of Nabu, it was the center of learning in Su-Meru. “There must have been a big library of cuneiform tablets here, but we have missed it so far,” she said. 2 Among her finds are several tablets and a foundation stone with inscriptions detailing why and how Nebuchadnezzar constructed the tower in Borsippa. One text says the king wanted the Borsippa built on the same design as that of the Tower of Babel, of which only the foundation survives in Babylon seven miles to the north. Another text quotes Nebuchadnezzar as declaring that Nabu’s tower should reach the skies and be no less in grandeur than that of Babel, which was dedicated to the god Marduk. Allinger-Csollich said the team’s evidence from texts and excavations show a tower of “greater dimensions than ours existed in Babylon.” Iraq has another impressive ziggurat in Ur, which was built in about 2500 BC.

Just imagine the impact the discovery of Nabu’s (Jesus’?) lost library would have on contemporary politics and religion. This remarkable story is of far greater significance in the Age of Terror than most realize. It is well known that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has connected himself with Nebuchadnezzar, spending over $500 million during the 1980s on the reconstruction and the re-establishment of ancient Babylon, the capitol of Nebuchadnezzar. Over sixty million bricks have been made to place in the walls of Babylon, each engraved with the inscription “To King Nebuchadnezzar in the reign of Saddam Hussein”. In essence, as has been widely reported by prophecy watchers and international news organizations alike, Saddam is saying he is the reincarnated Nebuchadnezzar. He is attempting to recreate and outdo the feats of the biblical king. This means, among other things, he must uncover the secrets of Nabu. Buried deep beneath the sands of Iraq are the temples that housed the history of humanity’s origins, and potentially, the stargate secrets of the Anunnaki. Saddam’s actions reveal his awareness of the political value of these secrets. His massive program to convert Iraq into a “Disneyland of the ancient Shining Ones” (my term), including the recreation of ancient Sumerian temples dedicated to the Shining Ones, the copying of ancient cuneiform tablets concerning the Shining Ones, and the retrieval of ancient Babylon’s famed Ishtar Gate from Berlin is among the most phenomenal efforts put forth by any earthly regime. One of the most startling antiquities moves is Iraq’s campaign to “revive” the Ashurbanipal Library, the earliest systematically collected and catalogued library in the ancient world. 3 This was the library of the king who said he could read the texts from before the Flood!

These include the famous 7th-century BC Flood Tablet, which relates part of the Epic of Gilgamesh and contains the “backstory” to the account of the flood given in the Book of Genesis. In April 2002 Iraqi archaeologists asked the British Museum if it would allow casts to be made of the cuneiform tablets. Although individual tablets have in the past been copied as casts, this would be the first time that any substantial number had been made. British Museum keeper John Curtis, who received the request during his visit to Baghdad last month, told The Art Newspaper that “the museum would do its best to cooperate.” 4 The proposed reconstructed library at Nineveh would hold copies of all of the British Museum’s tablets, and it is planned as both a scholarly center and tourist attraction. Alongside the library, the Saddam [Hussein] Institute for Cuneiform Studies will be set up as part of the University of Mosul. Plans are also being made to excavate one of the wings of King Ashurbanipal’s palace, in Kuyunjik Mound, where it is hoped that thousands of other tablets lie buried. There are 10,000 archaeological sites scattered through the country, most of them not fully excavated. In Iraq historical monuments are a matter of national security. This is because they mark the locations of the secrets of the Anunnaki. It’s absolutely impossible to get close to the legendary ziggurat of Ur without a letter of authorization. Ur, the Biblical city of the Chaldeans, is the land of the prophet Abraham, father of the three great monotheist religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. What is presented as the ruins of his house from around 4000 BC can also be seen near the ziggurat. The ziggurat was re-engineered by Nebuchadnezzar. A monumental staircase - rebuilt by order of Saddam Hussein - allows the visitor to ascend to the second stage.

As in the example set by a recent robbery the monument robbers want knowledge. Thieves smashed the doors of an Iraqi museum and a glass display case, absconding with cuneiform tablets and cylinders from the 6th century BC and the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. They left behind gold jewelry that might have tempted amateurs. Cylinders from the 6 th century BC are more valuable than gold for the information they record. The looting began in the tumultuous immediate aftermath of the Gulf War. In the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, and the southern area populated by Iraq’s restless Shiite Muslims, most of the provincial museums were ransacked. Iraqi authorities charge - and their accusations are backed up by some archaeologists abroad - that Sumerian antiquities are smuggled out of the country by diplomats and U.N. relief workers. Last summer, a landlord was cleaning out a Baghdad villa that had been recently vacated by a diplomat. Inside, he found two cartons of archaeologist fragments. The Iraqi government hasn’t named the diplomat or his country. Saddam believes he is to unite the Arab world under Islam. By recreating ancient Babylon, and by uncovering and disseminating the texts from ancient Iraq he can simultaneously duplicate the feats of Nebuchadnezzar and potentially pull the intellectual rug out from underneath Judaism and Christianity. The pre-history of both of these religions is found in Iraq. Saddam controls the temples that housed the “back story” of Judaism and Christianity. He seeks to retrieve the rest of the story and destroy these ‘false’ religions. If Saddam launches a storm of ancient knowledge it could turn current biblical scholarship into gumbo, and release a potentially debilitating thought virus into the Global Mind.

Importantly, in the last quarter of the 6 th century BC the watcher and the Holy One came down from heaven to inform King Nebu or Nabuchadezzar of his impending demise, evidently because the king had displeased the “most High God.” The “Holy one” appears to have been another term for angel, but when capitalized, it was a reference to Yahweh, as in “the Holy One of Israel.” Yahweh’s son, Jesus, was called Nazarenos , believed by some to have originated from nazar , meaning keep, guard, protect. In other words, one who watches. The king’s downfall, the change in regime, was “by decree of the Watchers,” and the demand for the regime change by the word of the “holy ones,” so that all people would know the “most High” rules in the affairs of Earth. These terms note the hierarchy in heaven, including the Watchers who observe the affairs of Earth, and who must have reported the king’s activities to the Holy ones, who were concerned enough to demand that the king be eliminated.

Once again, they want the King of Babylon dead. The question remains whether or not the gate to God will reopen as the Mayans say wil occur in 2012. When the dust clears, I am among those who anxiously await the opportunity to explore Iraq and her many secrets; particularly those involving the story of Daniel. DANIEL AND THE ILLUMINATI In 576 BC the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar looted and leveled the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem and carried off into exile thousands of its leading citizens along with the treasure of the Temple. From Judah’s royal and noble families a handful of “youths without blemish, handsome and skillful in all wisdom ” (Dan.1:4) were selected to serve in Nebuchadnezzar’s royal palace at Babylon. 6 Among them were the prophet Daniel and three companions, Hananiah, Misahel, and Azariah, who were given new Babylonian names: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The king soon found that these four were “ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom.” This is no small feat considering no less a personage than Pythagoras (“I am the serpent”) had been initiated into the mystery schools of Babylon by Chaldean priests just a few years before in 600 BC. 7 Pythagoras was the first to call himself a philosopher, a man who sought the secrets of becoming a god-man. Daniel (‘God is my judge’) was not a personal name. It was a group of people, and probably included his three wise companions. Consulting mythologist Barbara G. Walker, we learn that ‘Daniel’"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 182 was a title used to distinguish “a person of the Goddess Dana or Diana,” the Queen of Heaven. 8 Diana is the ‘light of Ana’, meaning ‘heaven’. Irish legend makes her the mother of the Celtic Tuatha De’ Danann (pronounced thoo-AH-huh duh-DAH-nun), the “fair folk” – the Sidhe people -- who brought the Stone of Destiny with them. In Irish history, the mystical Tuatha De’ Danann, are described as heaven-sent ‘gods, and not-gods’ (philosophers). They are compared with the Sanskrit deva (shining one, god) and adeva (Devil), which became daeva (devil) in Persian. The Old English divell (devil) can be traced to the Roman derivative divus , divi : gods. This magical race, ageless and beautiful, remains to this day in the fairy hills of Ireland. Godfrey Higgins, writing in the 19 th century suspected, and I agree, that Daniel was a Chaldee priest – a priest of the same order of which, in former times, Melchizedek had been a priest. 9 With a slight wave of the magician’s hand, Chaldee becomes Schaldee or Scala Dei meaning “Ladder to God,” another name for the Cross of Crucifixion and the nature of this priesthood is revealed. It was Melchizedek who initiated Abraham, the father of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, into the Eucharist or Holy Grail mysteries. After his initiation, Abram’s name was changed to Abraham. His wife Sarai became Sarah. The addition of the ‘H’ or ‘8’ signified their taking on the Cloak of the Illuminati. In Hebrew mysticism this H ladder is called the Sephiroth , the Mystical Tree. It features ten qualities as set forth in the Sefer ha- Zohar , the Cabalistic Book of Splendour . Cabalists called all ten collectively the Merkaba , or “chariot of god.” According to Jewish legend, this was the initiation Abraham and Sarah received. 11 This system of mystical science is also known as the Kaballah or Sabala (since the soft ‘c’ and the ‘s’, are interchangeable so too are the letters ‘s’ and ‘k’ are interchangeable). This connects Melchizedek with Meru and the Host, the Cloak of the Illuminati. In later times Jesus became a priest of the Order of Melchizedek. He put on the garment of glory. His secret teaching, referred to as the White Stone of Manna in the book of Revelation"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 183 is the Stone of Destiny of the children of Ana, which happens to be Jesus’ grandmother’s name. Current Dead Sea Scroll scholarship has revealed that to the Kanobi (or Essenes) Michael (and therefore Marduk) was none other than the Grail king Melchizedek or Michael-Zadok , meaning ‘Michael, Son of God’ . 10 As Laurence Gardner notes, fragments of the Prince Melchizedek Document discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls indicate that Melchizedek ( Milk a zedek) and Michael were one and the same. Michael, the mercurial archangel who escorted souls between dimensions and whose presence is most certainly felt in this story is traditionally known as the dragon-slaying angel. This aligns him with Marduk, who slayed the dragon Tiamat. According to the Epistle to the Hebrews Melchizedek comes to us “without father, without mother, without ancestry, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life.” 12 He is described in three verses of Genesis 14:18-20. Melchizedek is said to mean the “King of Salem and priest of the Most High God.” In Hebrew, salem means ‘peace’. To me, this suggests a title and one of which is attached to Jesus: the Peacemaker. Some maintain Salem (Peace) is not a title. It is a place. It has been suggested that the Salem from whence Melchizedek originated is Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. Moriah is a Meru word. When allowing for the substitution Melchizedek (Michael’s) Mount Moriah is Mount Meru. Hebrews states that Jesus was a High Priest of the line of Melchizedek. 13 This meant that Jesus not only held the earthly office of the slayer of the serpent or dragon, the office of the archangel Michael, but also received the H initiation (a possible source for the expression Jesus H . Christ!). Therefore, to the Essenes, Jesus, like Michael before him, was the Michael, Lord of the Host or the manna. Sometimes Michael is shown with an arrow. One must bear in mind that the terms “sword,” “spear,” “arrow,” “rod,” “dart,” were commonly used throughout Christian symbolism to designate forces that are not understood or are “spiritual.” As we have noted,"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 184 they are forces of Anu . The dragon designated wisdom, as well as keys, tones, frequencies or vibrations. We note hear that the words “spear” and “spire” – the vertical attachment placed on top of a church – are virtually identical, and that the French word fleche – “arrow” – also refers to a church spire. Fleche is flag, and the flag (or ax) is the symbol for the gods. Where have we seen the image of a rod or pillar and a dragon? It is the symbol for Amurru or Meru, whom the Sumerians called Marduk . Like the Egyptian sun god Ra, Michael and Marduk are Axis-wielding dragon slayers. They are considered to be interchangeable, mythologically speaking.

Indeed, he said he came not to bring peace, but a sword. This sword or Word is connected with E.A. According to Zecharia Sitchin, the artificially raised platform atop Jerusalem’s Mount Moriah ( Mari Ra , Meru-a ) upon which Solomon’s Temple sat, had once been the location of a facility constructed by the Ana called the DUR.AN.KI – “The Bond of Heaven and Earth.” 14 He further states that the Sumerians described this as a tall pillar reaching into the heavens. This pillar was secured to the platform and was used by the Ana to “pronounce the Word” heavenward. Sitchin interprets this as a sophisticated antenna . This device holds a key to our exploration. We may come to a further understanding of this ‘antenna’ when it is realized that the Egyptian priests at Abydos, Egypt constructed a huge representation of a device called the Ta-Wer , which literally translated also means “ the Bond between Heaven and Earth ” – the same meaning as the Su-Merian DUR.AN.KI . It resembles in form, and I believe function, the antenna the Egyptians called the Pillar or Casket of Osiris and constructed at Meroe in Egypt. The Buddhists called it Su-Meru or Meru. Hindu myths say it is an Axis that served as a Ladder to Heaven. Meru is the home of Sabala or Shambhalla (which rings of Shem-bell-a ), the ‘light ship of the gods’. Some say Mount Meru is to be found in southwestern Tibet. It is called Mount Kailasa, where thousands of pilgrims go every year. Every year, the Bön- pas and the Nyingmapas celebrate a New Year’s Day festival. They erect the phallic pole in the valley below the mountain. This is similar to the Sumerian Akitu Festival. The phallic pole is symbolic of the antenna-like ‘bond Heaven and Earth’ the Dur.An.Ki is supposed to be."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 186 When one explores t he Lords of Meru or Sabala /Shambhala, it is easy to see that they are successors to and/or holders of the Anu- ship, or antenna of the An. This explains why Nicholas Roerich went to Mongolia to search for this antenna. According to Sumerian myth interpreted by Sitchin, the Ana came from the mysterious Planet X referred to in Babylonian texts. Its logo, the 8-rayed star is symbolically equivalent to the 8-rayed flower, , the symbol for the Shambhala initiation, and the Eight-Fold Path of Buddha. Its main thrust is in the Initiation of advanced Buddhist monks into the Kalachakra (“Wheel of Time”) Tradition. Once the candidate has been led through the seven gates, and received the seven initiations, it is possible for them to be received in the court of Shambhala. Sometime circa 973 BCE (the time of the building of the First Temple of Solomon) a new Dynasty of Kings of Shambhala was initiated, beginning with Suchandra. Interestingly, the Queen of Sheba or Saba played a key role in Solomon’s story. Her name comes from Sabala , the root of Shambhala. Perhaps the confluence of these events – the building of Solomon’s Temple atop Moriah , the Queen of Saba, and the Shambhala initiation ‘atop’ Meru -- is due to some phenomenon associated with the Ana. This ‘Meru Antenna’ was passed around the ancient world, finding expression in many cultures. Priesthoods developed who preserved its secrets. Presently, a blueprint for it is in Nashville. Daniel and his three illuminated companions emerge as"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 187 knowledgeable in the operation of this Ladder to God or the Cross or Light that teaches us to put on the Cloak of the Illuminati. This is highly important. Scalit means ‘wise man’ and comes from slt , assistant to the High Priest. 15 Fascinatingly, Scala means a ladder or flight of steps. 16 Lit means light or to illuminate. One gets the obvious impression that they knew how to scaled the steps to Heaven. Tracing the word scalit backward, as did Godfrey Higgins, we learn the root sclt comes from saca, which is the same as the Hebrew word ske , imaginari, and scio , to contemplate. The root sk , became skl , wisdom, and our skill or knowledge or scientia (wisdom). 17 This word fossil, Skill or Skilly, resurfaced in Britain as a name for the Blessed Isles , the surviving islands of Atlantis in British lore. Atlantis was also known as Ultima Thule or Tula . This is the same name as the Druid homeland. For refusing to worship his golden image, Nebuchadnezzar condemned the three wise men from Solomon’s Temple to a fiery furnace; a 12 th century manuscript illumination."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 188 Nebuchadnezzar negotiated a deal with these wise temple priests -- the Lords of Mount Meru -- to open a gateway to Heaven (Tula). As the book of Daniel describes , 18 the king had constructed an enigmatic 90-foot tall image of gold (the Israelite’s golden calf, the Pillar of Mer) in the plain of Dura ( Tura or Tula ), a province of Babylon, one of the most glorious cities of all time. He was unable to make the image work. However, he was convinced that the three wise men could. I believe this image and the Pillar of Meru are the same. He made the men put on their coats, their hats and their other garments and enter a “fiery furnace” apparently powered by the image of gold. When they reappeared not only were they in pristine condition, they were not alone. They had the Son of God in tow. 19 The book of Daniel is famous for its stories of heroes. These three wise men, Shadrach, Mishak, Rishak and Abed-nego top the list. When they stepped out alive from the burning fiery furnace it was a sign to many that they were protected by the power of God. This may be so. However, one wonders, why, if they are entering a fiery furnace believing that they would be protected by God, would they need to put on any special clothing at all? Wouldn’t God protect them in their ‘street’ clothes? Were they trusting God, but taking precautions? To me, this detail is a tip that something magical or supernatural is being described in this story. And it has everything to do with the Cloak of the Illuminati. Nebuchadnezzar’s fiery furnace episode calls to mind an episode recorded in the apocryphal Book of Jasher . In the episode the biblical shaman, Abraham, and his brother, Harran, Nimrod placed the sons of Terah or Tara, in a ‘fiery furnace’. “And all the king’s servants, priests, lords, governors, and judges, and all the inhabitants of the land, about nine hundred thousand men , stood opposite the furnace to see Abraham.” The fiery furnace is often taken as a symbol for the pit of Abaton or Hell. This was the pit that Joseph was placed into.

As I approach the mysteries of this ‘fiery furnace’, I find the greatest understanding by interpreting it as a zone of frequency or vibration (‘fire’) that is the mouth of a stargate or a wormhole. That is, this ‘hole in space’ was a tunnel system linking two regions of space-time, Earth and Tula at the center of the galaxy. When the three wise men entered this star gateway they traveled to a distant place, possibly to crystal halls of Christ’s court at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, which the ancients considered the source of our souls. Fascinatingly Tula is Sanskrit for ‘balance’. To repeat, the zodiacal sign for Libra, the scales , representing balance is . To me, looks like the rising hub of the Milky Way. It represents the Holy Spirit . Alchemists alternated between and when signifying the essence of a substance , or the spirit . Balancing the essence within ourselves with the essence of Tula places us in judgment or harmony, in scale (key), with G od. This symbolism may be a coincidence. Or, it may point to the source of the name Scala Dei . It was not long after this episode that theWatchers decreed the death of the king Nebuchadnezzar."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 190"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 191 11. THE NEW MIGHTY MAN In his 1959 novel Starship Troopers , Robert Heinlein invented the idea of powered battle armor, which gave an infantryman more fighting power than a modern tank, protected him from battlefield hazards, allowed central command to locate him and monitor his vital signs, and even dispensed medical treatment. The idea has become a cliché of computer games, but it’s always remained science fiction. In March 2002, though, the U.S. Army announced it is giving the Massachusetts Institute of Technology $50 million to establish the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (ISN), whose primary goal is to develop a new battle suit for special forces that would “heal them, shield them, and protect them against chemical and biological warfare,” in the words of Edwin L. Thomas, director of the new institute. 1 MIT plans to develop chameleon-like uniforms and materials that could help protect soldiers against detection, threats, bullets and chemical agents, monitor their life support systems. This “coat of many colors” or miracle garment can even heal those who are wounded. He said different fibers could be used to carry fluids, emit signals, or change shape all in the same piece of clothing, while remaining lightweight. Another focus of the research will be to design a suit that would help keep the soldier from being seen by using sensors so that the uniform would blend into whatever background might be. The soldiers would also wear boots that would build up a charge of energy so that, if needed, a leap of 20 feet up would be possible. “We want to understand what the soldier needs, and we’re talking protection and survivability,” Thomas said. “We hope to be able to deliver some goods early, if we can.” He said that with the help of"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 192 industry partners, prototypes could eventually be fielded “in a fairly short time.” 2 As Thomas points out, “Imagine the psychological impact upon a foe when encountering squads of seemingly invincible warriors protected by armor and endowed with superhuman capabilities.” 3 This is the suit of the Mighty Man (MIT-ey Man), 21 st century style. It is only the beginning of what will be possible. None of the research will be classified, which means any materials developed will also be available for civilian uses--protecting police and firefighters, for instance, or possibly mountain climbers and other extreme sports enthusiasts. My interest is in the development of an extreme spiritual suit that enhances our psychic abilities. A scientific and technical revolution has just begun based upon the ability to systematically organize and manipulate matter at the nanoscale. It is not difficult to image a modern Nimrod in the military creating a population of such Mighty Men. Nanotechnology “grows” materials by adding the right atoms and molecules. It is the creation of functional materials, devices and systems through control of matter on the nanometer length scale (1-100 nanometers). For comparison, 10 nanometers is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. It is the space where Newton’s physics leave off and the quantum world begins. NASA is leading the way in nanotechnology. Advanced miniaturization and increased strength to weight ratios in materials is a key thrust area to enable new science and exploration missions. Ultrasmall sensors, power sources, communication, navigation, and propulsion systems with very low mass, volume and power consumption are needed. Revolutions in electronics and computing will allow reconfigurable, autonomous, spacecraft that “think for themselves.” Biologically inspired sensors, self-repairing nano systems, supercomputers based on the brain and data storage based on DNA will be hallmarks of the new spacecraft.

Biological molecules linked with gold or other semi-conducting nanoparticles, can be controlled electronically, remotely, reversibly and precisely thus generating functional biometallic nanostructures potentially useful as interface structures between electronic and biological systems. This will enable remote repair of the body. Behind all this is a movement to go from “wearable” computing to continuous computing beneath the skin and the redesign of the human species, to give us a “new genes” with nanocomputers inside, “new organs,” and “new skin”. New human potentials and skills await. The potential changes for how these computers will shape us are radical. A draft government report says we will alter human evolution, meaning the human body, within 20 years not by spiritual means, but by combining what we know of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive sciences – the four primary 21 st century Power Tools. The building blocks of these Power Tools are bits, neurons, genes and atoms. The 405-page report sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and Commerce Department, Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance , calls for a broad-based research program to improve human performance leading to telepathy, machine-to-human communication, amplified personal sensory devices and enhanced intellectual capacity. 4 The platform for this is the creation of a second human skin. Scientific leaders from a broad range of disciplines contributed papers. Particpants examined the impact of these converging technologies in six different areas of relevance: Overall potential of converging technology , Expanding human cognition and communication , Improving human health and physical capabilities , Enhancing group and societal outcomes , National security , and Unifying science and education . 5"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 194 This report develops a provocative thesis that human society has become an immense living being – a global super organism in which we humans are knitted together by our modern technology and communication.

From the darks side, one can imagine that Americans must transform themselves into Mighty Men in order to survive. In fact, says the report, the entire human race must transform or die. 7 The report envisions startling revolutions in basic science leading to sustaining human and mental abilities throughout the life span through neuroscience and cellular biology at the nanoscale. An active and dignified life could be possible far into the person’s second century, due to the convergence of technologies. Gene therapy to cure early aging syndromes may become common. New communication paradigms (brain-to-brain, brain-to- computer) could be realized by 2025. Neuromorphic engineering may allow transmission of thought from human to machines for processing. Wearable computers will constantly broker our needs with machines capable of providing them. Visual communication will enhance, and possibly replace, linguistic communication. 8 Nanotechnology will provide the means to deliver medications to the exact location of the brain where they are needed. The convergence of cognitive science with bio-, nano- and info or cogno technologies should allow us to eliminate mental disorders from Alzheimers to Parkinson’s to schizophrenia. It will allow the development of new prosthetic or assistive devices that will compensate for cognitive or emotional deficiencies. 9 How this will affect us spiritually is unknown, and virtually unconsidered in the government report, which focuses more on economic and military policy.

The destiny of America rides on how we deal with these convergent technologies and the enhancement of human performance. 10 Like Nimrod’s Babylon, a civilization of Mighty Men is fast approaching our company. We already are “enhanced,” and will only become more enhanced in the near future. Contact lenses, artificial joints, pacemakers, and hearing aids promote our health. Chips are available to enhance our behavior. Today, over sixty percent of Americans are obese, according to a recent government study. Within twenty-five years we could add a new statististic. Sixty-five percent of the population may be on their way to becoming Mighty Men, and have one or more of these technologies enhancing their body system. Within the domain of the brain, advances in Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) have given scientists promise that soon they can track which parts of the brain are used for such emotions such as love, hate, fear, as well as to reactions such as beauty. 11 There is reason to believe that once these areas are isolated they can be manipulated. Theoretically, one could live perpetually in the emotion of love (or fear). Shamans teach that out-of-body experiences are achieved through meditation, reflection and entering a transcendental zone. Scientists believe they have isolated a specific area of the brain that triggers OBEs. Imagine putting on a out-of-body experience helmet and automatically traveling far into the universe. Neuroscientists hope to assist future learning by discovering the biotechnological signature of phenomenon and discovering the place cells where different kinds of information are stored, and in this way enhance “robosapien’s” information gathering capacity. 12 Unpacking the secrets of the brain will serve the higher purpose of enabling more efficient human-computer communication. Ultimately, the goal is to acquire the ability to predict the behavior of an individual, and by extension, of groups. 13 Say goodbye to your keyboard and mouse.

We would perhaps become more of a hive mind - an enormous, single, intelligent entity.” 14 The report says the abilities are within our grasp but will require an intense public-relations effort to “prepare key organizations and societal activities for the changes made possible by converging technologies”, and to counter concern over “ethical, legal and moral” issues. Education should be overhauled down to the primary-school level to bridge curriculum gaps between disparate subject areas. Professional societies should be open to practitioners from other fields, it says. “The success of this convergent-technologies priority area is crucial to the future of humanity,” the report says. For some, this next step in human evolution -- the putting on of the suit of the Mighty Man – is a disturbing notion. There are many financial, political, spiritual, and scientific side effects or ramifications and repercussions to consider, if things go wrong this time. It leads to a portrayal of the world reeling towards despotic control based on the use of high technology. Is there a purpose, beyond military advantage, of producing a technologically enhanced race of humans to walk the Earth among humans? Will this race be used for the control and punishment of ordinary humans, or anyone who thinks of challenging the modern Nimrod who control this technology? At the present pace the new soldier will be in place by 2025. The new human will be fully in place by 2050, maybe sooner. None of the reports envision a spiritual function to this technology.

But do we really want to do this to ourselves? Where do we go from there as a species? The creation of these beings and the unparalleled achievements they will bring will rescue us from extinction and earn us the distinction as a civilization that is arbitrarily advanced . Where, exactly, are we headed with this technology? What is to come surely centers on wormholes or stargates and their construction. The pace of scientific discovery points at wormholes as the obvious next level of the evolution of our species, and our religions. 6,000 years ago the human race progressed from stone to Bronze Age technology. 2,000 years later we progressed from Bronze to Iron. 1700 years later the printing press was invented. 300 years later the telescope appeared. 150 years later electricity and the telephone took on widespread use, which places us in the early 1900s and the massive dominance of the planet by the internal combustion engine. 1945 nuclear fission is mastered. 1947 the Roswell Crash. The ‘day’ after Roswell, the 1950s, the transistor. 1960s space travel. 1970s genetic engineering; including cloning. 1980s nanotechnology. 1990s Internet. As we will discuss in a later chapter, beyond 2000 is the convergence of cognitive science with bio-, nano- and information technologies, and the redesign of the human body. An important issue to modern physicists involved in the design of wormholes involves shielding the passengers from interactions with the exotic material that composes the throat of these tunnels. This substance might have harmful effects on human beings. Scientists propose three possible ways to deal with this problem. One would be to shield the passengers through a protective tube, for example. The second way would be to concentrate the exotic matter in one area or to use special sorts of exotic matter that are less harmful. The third solution for dealing with this matter would be to keep it as far away as possible and avoid human contact with it. 11 Their solution for protecting the passenger from the exotic matter has not been thought of by modern wormhole designers."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 198 They transformed the passenger, the human being, into a Shining One. Simply, one would not casually walk through one of these water doors, star gates, white holes or “space doors of light or wisdom,” as is commonly portrayed in movies. Instead, an extraordinary mental, physical, emotional, and physical training was undertaken preparatory to this excursion. The result was the transformation or transfiguration from a human into a pure being. The myths of the Shining Ones suggests some form of genetic alteration, the ‘putting on of a cloak’, that triggered a shift from human to Homo Christos or Homo Illuminati that protected the rider from the exotic matter and enabled them to scale the ancient ladder to Heaven. Transfiguration is an experience and a noble change of state, which Christians believe we shall undergo during the second coming of Jesus (which occurs after the destruction of the rebuilt Babylon, present day Iraq). Transfiguration is what Paul is talking about in 1 Corinthians 15 when he proclaims that we shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump.

This opening of a gateway is often accompanied by illustrations of the bright cloud (read UFO by many) that overshadowed the Transfiguration. Transfiguration scenes often show Jesus in the midst of a beam of light or standing in front of a bulls-eye. It provides a model for apotheosis ; deification or “god making,” for the enlightenment of the initiate. The bulls-eyes appear to represent the whirlwind that transported Enoch and others into the heavens. POSTSCRIPT While completing this last chapter of the book, Dana Augustine, the artist who did the cover, brought to my attention the story of Spring Heeled Jack. As recounted at anomalyinfo.com, during the 1830’s, this ‘man’ terrorized England. Described as tall, thin, and powerful, wearing a black cloak, the man could jump 20 to 30 feet vertical. It was reported that he had large pointy ears and nose, with red glowing eyes, and capable of spitting an odd white and blue flame from his mouth. U nder his cloak Spring Heeled Jack had an embroidered letter ‘W’ on his shirt. Similar to a coat of arms, the Gold ‘W’ seemed to indicate someone of royalty. He wore a large helmet and a sort of tight-fitting costume that felt like oilskin. But the cape was just like the ones worn by the policemen of the era. His hands were as cold as ice and like powerful claws. But the most frightening thing about him was his eyes. They shone like balls of fire. In August of 1877, Spring Heeled Jack appeared before a group of soldiers in Aldershot’s North army camp. A Private John Regan was standing sentry at the camp when he heard the noise of someone dragging something metallic down the road. He went to investigate and finding nothing unusual turned to return to his post. When he did, Spring Heeled Jack leapt at him and spat blue"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 201 flames from his mouth into the boy’s face. Other sentries heard the commotion and hurriedly ran to his aid. Witnesses claim that Spring Heeled Jack jumped over the men, clearing them by 10 feet or more. The sentry fired at the intruder and claimed that bullets did not affect him (note that some reports indicate that these sentry men were not allowed live ammunition but rather ‘blanks’ only were used to warn off evil-doers). The sentry described the attacker as tall and thin wearing a helmet and oilskin suit. One month later, in Lincolnshire, Spring Heeled Jack was seen hurdling over several houses. As in the Aldershot episode, residents fired at him with shotguns to no avail. These witnesses claimed that the shots did hit Spring Heeled Jack and sounded like they were hitting some sort of metallic object. In September 1904, South of Liverpool in England, Spring Heeled Jack appeared on the roof of a church. He was spotted hanging on the steeple of St. Francis Xaviers on Salisbury Street. Onlookers claimed he suddenly dropped from the steeple and fell to the ground. Thinking that he had committed suicide, they rushed to the point where he had landed (behind some houses) only to find a helmeted man, clothed in white, standing there waiting. He scuttled towards the crowd, raised his arms, and took to the air over William Henry Street. The final recorded event occurred in 1920 at the Central Railway Station in London. A man in a white cloak was seen jumping back and forth from rooftop to the street below. Several theories have been proposed. Everything from a normal man with some sort of spring apparatus to the devil himself (it was reported that cloven footprints had been found at the site of one of the incidents) has been offered as explanations. Lack of hard evidence leaves a lingering cloud of mystery over this anomaly. Notable in the stories is the observation that Jack’s clothing deteriorated over the years. Possibly Daniel Cohen offers our best explanation. In the Encyclopedia of Monsters, Daniel noted that ‘penny dreadfuls’ were very popular during the era. These magazines, similar to"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 202 modern day comic books, often featured stories of Spring Heeled Jack. Titled Spring-Heel’d Jack - The Terror of London, these stories may have distorted many of the facts we glean from this case although the chance of these events being entirely fiction seems unlikely. This leads me to wonder if this person may have found an ancient suit of the Mighty Man, perhaps brought back from Babylon, which British archaeologists had begun excavating at the time. Or, perhaps even more profoundly, a future Mighty Man may have found a means, perhaps even a wormhole, to travel back in time."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"CLOAK OF THE ILLUMINATI 203 NOTES AND REFERENCES CHAPTER ONE: THE ILLUMINIST’S SECRET GARDEN 1.
