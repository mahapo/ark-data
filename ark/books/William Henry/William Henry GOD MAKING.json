Science must. Scanning the front pages of today’s newspapers with their stunning news of genetic and medical advancement one’s senses are bombarded with particles of data that suggest that we are living i n an age of miracles. The largest particle of them all is the Human Genome Project. In the summer of 2,000 it was announced that the ten-year effort involving thousands of scientists worldwide was essentially complete. The Human Genome, the huma n genetic code, had been mapped. This historic achiev ement was compared in scale to man walking on the Moon. The genetic code, what scientists call the Book of Life, had been popped out of the nucleus of our cells, deconstructed to its minimal essence like the indivi dual notes of a love song, and reassembled from beginning t o end. The most fundamental units of DNA are called nucleotide (or nu-clay- otide) bases. The genetic code looks like a string of letters representing the four substances (elementum) that m ake up every gene: adenine, thymine, cystosine and gau nine, referred to simply as A, T, C and G. The whole human genome contains about 3.5 billion such letters."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 2 If the entire genome, the notes of the love song, were printed in USA Today it would fill 151,910 pages and create a 42-foot-high stack of folded newspapers at t he newsstand. 1 If printed, this would be the ultimate copy of USA Today for the next 1,000 years or so. The experience of being able to read the spiraling script or Book of Life in front of us in all of its detailed glory separates us from all past humans. It separates us f rom history. It should give you chills. A complete reading of the human genome will enable a deeper understanding of our species’ evolution (our past) and will ignite a revolution in human evolution (ou r future). No laboratory in the world is yet capable of creating a human cell. However, the complete map of the genetic code may permit designers to genetically change any and all aspects, including the appearance and disposition, of a child and to eliminate most human diseases. This is an amazing statement considering it was onl y in 1953 that scientists Francis Crick and James Watson discovered that genes are composed of long, twisted chemical threads of DNA (‘deoxyribonucleic acid’). If we could isolate the first cell, and untwist it, the molecule would resemble a ladder, with two long side - pieces supporting a regular series of rungs. Appearin g like an endlessly spiraling staircase, the double helix of DNA is the basis for all life on Earth. Coiling, twisting and doubling back on itself, DNA resembles a figure 8 or a spiraling H. In the 1960s, the ‘genetic code’ was worked out. It was shown how the structure of DNA was translated into the structure of molecules that controlled the chemistry of every cell in our body."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 3 Two DNA strands are twisted around each other to ma ke a double helix. In the 1970’s, techniques were discovered by which DNA molecules could be cut into pieces and recombined in new ways. Genes from one species could be transf erred to the cells of another species and absorbed by the chromosomes there. Like artists mixing paint pigments, scientists began to combine DNA molecules from one species with another species. This ‘recombinant-DNA’ artistic movement ushered in an era in which human beings had the pow er to redesign humanity and other living beings. Scientis ts could produce genes in organisms that had never previousl y had them. They could create genes that had never existed anywhere . There was still more advancement to come. From the 1970’s through the 1990’s scientists had not yet un locked the genetic sequence of an entire human chromosome. The major advance in the worldwide effort to unravel all the genes that make up a human being would have to wait until after the year 2,000 when the Human Genome Project delivered its results.

This profound movement will soon enable us to manipulate not just the DNA of Earth, but also the entire biosphere. WAVE TO PARADISE Now consider this. The Human Genome project announcement came beaming to us at a time when fundamental and revolutionary discoveries are being made in mathematics (chaos and string theory), quantum physics (hyperspace), biophysics (morphogenetic theory), communications (the Internet) and astronomy (black and white holes). All of this at the same time we are combining the human form with electronic technologies and taking over management of the Earth garden some prefer to call th e bio-info-sphere, a concept created by a convergence of sciences and technologies made up of biotechnology, ecology and information/communications technologies . We are surrounded by high technology medicine that rivals the magical healing powers reported in the m yths of the ancient gods. Biological computer circuitry enabling us to extend our lives, and our consciousness, is making its way bene ath the human skin. A merger between man and computer is occurring. Not long ago just the idea of the computer technology used by modern medicine would have seemed like the stuff of ancient mythology or science fictio n to the average person. As human beings we build machines to extend consciousness. The astrophysicist becomes the machine orbiting Jupiter. The oceanographer becomes the submarine exploring the ocean floor. The space scie ntists become the space shuttle Atlantis a tiny technological island floating the cosmic ocean."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 5 To mystics, the ultimate level of consciousness is God consciousness or Christ consciousness where we have the ability to heal ourselves and remake our world. The remaking of the human body (the “old bottle”) in th e new millennium suggests we are on the verge of creating “new bottles” to correspond with the higher vibrations of the “new wine” of this consciousness. Imagine what our lives would be like if we developed medical/spiritual technologies designed to develop our God consciousness and we lived every moment our lives in a state of spiritual enlightenment. A major effort is underway to develop nanotechnology medical tools smaller than a billionth of a meter that can repair and maintain the human body. Imagine if we could implant a “Dr. Chip,” a computer chip complete with a holographic avatar that contain ed all the healing and spiritual knowledge of humanity into our body. “Dr. Chip” could instruct nano-surgeons to repair our body, perhaps indefinitely, and act like an “angel on our shoulder” to keep us spiritually, physically and emotionally ‘attuned’ at all times. On top of the biological computer revolution, today’s synthetic pharmaceutical concoctions rival the Holy Grail , the Cup of Immortality of myth. The “Plant of Life” is also becoming a reality. Scientists have discovered that maybe we can get blood from a turnip after all. 2 Plants have been used in medical treatments throughout human history, but now research ers are taking a new approach to plants as pharmaceutical components. They are genetically modifying plants t o produce human blood proteins and tissue growth agen ts. This eliminates the risk of using contaminated blood during blood transfusions.

The miracle of creation is now at our fingertips. Humanity’s quest for immortality has led us to the gates of paradise. In an instant our entire situation has changed (and will change again soon). THE MAGIC TREE Most of us want to know how the advances of science and medicine can prolong or better our lives and boost our economy. Yet, ‘in the big picture’, something far mor e profound is occurring. The trajectory of modern science may return us a complete revolution to the Garden of Creation where humanity was first planted and educated in the secre ts of creation. This suggests we are in for an encounter with the deepest and and most powerful forces of creation. This book proposes that Eden’s forbidden Tree of Knowledge, the “magic tree” of myth, has symbolically reappeared in the DNA double helix and we are eager ly climbing it. According to Dr. Carl Jung, the shaman or spiritual healer climbs the magic tree in order to find his true self in the upper world. In his ecstatic journey “he acquires his ‘mystical organs’, which in some sort constitute his tr ue and complete spiritual personality.” 3 This Tree and the human journey upon it are part physical and part myth. The higher we climb the more our perspective changes. New knowledge that reminds of our spiritual identity, our partnership with nature, our past, our powers leads us t o full spiritual maturity."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 7 In our journey we cross the “Horizon of Eternity,” where we become active citizens of two worlds; the Wor ld Above and the World Below. That is, we not only play god, but we become part man and part god. This is the departure point for a leap to the next rung of the evolutionary spiral. What is next? As we will explore late, according to Hebrew myths, man once used spiritual powers to cre ate people and animals. These myths emphasize the spiri tual component of our present situation. We are like the caterpillar that is the embryo of the butterfly. In its pupal phase the caterpillar is an ear thly worm that has, enfolded within its DNA, a winged cr eature awaiting release from its material envelope. A new human is enfolded within our DNA. What does this new human look like? When will we release it? Should we? The premise of this book is that ancient myths reveal anatomical knowledge that is startlingly consistent with the discoveries of modern genetics. It behooves all that have ego ambitions of playing god , or spiritual ambitions of making themselves over in to gods, to examine these myths if for no other reason than they suggest that we are in for the time of our lives once we release our inner potentials. For this reason we need to familiarize ourselves with certain myths, particularly creation myths, and the esoteric scientific knowledge they contain. The creation myths of early civilizations were meant to help initiates assess their evolutionary situation, locate the magic tree, and access the spiritual domain. This knowledge is critical if we decide to make the transi tion from human to god-like consciousness and perform go d- like feats. As most realize, when humanity engaged in the secre ts of creation in the Judeo-Christian Garden of Eden s tory we ran into trouble with a wisdom-wielding serpent who hid in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 8 the Tree of Life and Knowledge. The modern phrase “don’t mess with Mother Nature” captures the essence of this creation myth and provides a stern warning to scientists of our time. In many myths men are seen dueling with a serpent that threatens to attack him. The Sumerians told of Marduk and his battle with the female dragon of chaos Tiam at. The Greeks represented Apollo struggling with and stran gling a python. The Egyptians depicted Horus treading upon a crocodile, the dragon of the Nile. Jesus promised his disciples the power to tread down serpents. All these myths I propose, and will substantiate, are allusions to the twisting serpentine coils of DNA. Though we may not realize it, each of us are individually and collectively battling the serpent. We are therefore responsible for what happens to our specie s as a result of our present duel or partnership with DNA. Ancient myths provide guidelines for this relations hip. The physicians of the past knew a great secret about the serpent and the magic tree. This secret is best illustrated by an Oriental fable. The gods called a meeting to dec ide where to hide the secrets of the enormous healing powe rs provided by this tree. One god proposed hiding them on top of the highest mountain. But the other gods countered that man woul d one day learn to climb this mountain. Another god suggested hiding them at the bottom of the ocean. Again the prescient gods foretold a time when man would turn himself into a fish and explore the bottom of the ocean. A third god proposed hiding the secrets in the middl e of the Earth. But alas, said the gods, man would learn to tunnel into the Earth like the worm. Finally, the fourth and wisest god of them all proposed the ultimate hiding place. “Let us hide the secrets of the enormous healing powers within man."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 9 Who would ever think to look for them there?” Indeed, the magic Tree of Life and its profound healing secrets -- the secrets of god making -- are hidden within the human mind/body/spiritual system. THE POWER OF 8 The ancients spoke of 8 great powers which correspond with 7 nerve centers (plus a ‘hidden’ 8 th ) inside our body. References to these 8 great powers coiled inside the double helix (8) of our DNA are found in the oldest myths dealing with human beliefs. The ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, Greeks and Hindus assigned secret spiritual meaning to every part of th e body. Ancient ‘physicians of the soul’ believed that if the se 8 powers were accessed it could release tremendous hea ling power into our lives and our world. In addition to Jesus, some of these great physicians of the soul who attained mastery of these powers inclu ded the Egyptian gods Isis, Thoth and Ptah, the Greek philo sopher Pythagoras, and Mary Magdalene. Myths and scripture is the vehicle through which the wisdom teachings of the magic tree and the powers o f 8 are preserved and disseminated. Fortunately, nature has seen to it that the key myt hs we need are easily accessible (their secrets, however, are a totally different story). THE THOUGHT SPHERE Most are familiar with genes , DNA. They propagate themselves by jumping from body to body via sperm or egg. In mythology, the secrets of god making are duplicated in memes . 4 These atom-like basic units of cultural transmissio n are the building blocks of the collective mind of humanity."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 0 Examples of memes are songs, stories, ideas and belie fs. They propagate themselves by jumping from brain to brain. Just as DNA can unravel itself to create the living structure of the body, memes can create the living structure of ideas I will call the Thought Sphere , or the ‘universal mind’ of humanity. The Egyptian scribe of the gods Thoth, who was call ed the “Lord of 8,” is credited in Egyptian lore with the invention of magic and writing. Freemasons also say t hat Thoth possessed all secret knowledge on 36,525 scrolls that were hidden under the heavenly vault (the sky) . This ‘global brain’ is comprised of all the thoughts of all humans from all time. We have all become aware of our ozone layer and its function. Maybe now we will also recognize the ancient idea of the thought zone or though t sphere, too. Many healers and physicians have embraced the idea of the ‘one mind’. The famed Swiss psychiatrist and occultist Dr. Carl G. Jung called it the ‘collective unconscious’. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the French Christian my stic and paleontologist, called it the ‘Noosphere’ (from noe , meaning ‘mind’, ‘intelligence’). He said that: “All around us, tangibly and materially, the thinking envelope of the Earth -- the Noosphere -- is adding to its internal fibers and tightening its network.” 5 He believed that someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for the second time in the history of the world, man will discover Fire. ‘Nous’ happens to be one of the names by which the early Christian gnostics (Greek for ‘knowledge’) ref erred to Jesus. He was the great mind or ‘spirit of all intelligence’, a soul whose particles were sprinkled amongst all creation."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 1 Nous, the spirit of all intelligence. In 1950, de Chardin predicted the coming of an “ultra- humanity” destined to converge in an “Omega Point” -- a “cosmic Christ” who is the “consummation of the evolutionary process.” 6"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 2 Hildegard of Bingen, the great twelfth-century Germ an mystic saint and healer painted a divinely inspired vision of Christ as Nous standing in front of a network of fibe rs inviting all to embrace the Nous sphere. Hildegard reported having many inspired visions in which she received knowledge directly from a higher plane. These visions were the source of healing wisdom widel y accepted by physicians and healers of her time and r ecently rediscovered in our own. Long before these enlightened thinkers, the ancient Goddess tradition proposed that Nu , Nun (the “primal waters of chaos”) 7 or Nut to the Egyptians and Sumerians was the Great Mother of ideas. 8 Ideas emanated from the Female Soul of the World, which they called Psyche (‘soul’, ‘butterfly’) or Sophia (‘wisdom’). 9 Nous or knowledge can be passed on from generation to generation via the DNA and memes through a morphogenetic field according to the theory of format ive causation. Biologist and chemist Rupert Sheldrake upholds the possibility that all can tune into memories or tho ughts from the distant past that are not stored in our br ain. 10 In Sheldrake’s Morphic Resonance theory the human DNA molecule plays the role of a receiver of all the knowledge accumulated by humanity. By matching our DNA’s signal with someone who came before us, or even after us, we can tap into their knowledge. No matter what we choose to call it, the Thought Sphere or morphic field, in which each of us lives and breathes, is like the Magic Mirror of fairy tales. What we put out into this mirror it is what we get back. That is the Golden Rule of all religion and the foundation of mythology. What we believe about ourselves sets the limits for the possible by which we all live our lives. Our beliefs about ourselves will, in turn, impact ho w future civilizations view them selves."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 3 Likewise, we are the flower of the seed planted long ago. This is so because neu roscientists strongly believe that the human brain is holographic in nature. 11 Psychologists concur with the view of human consciousness as holographic. In other words, just as the most basic tenet of holography is that “the part contains the whole,” or tha t the part contains the information about the whole, from which the part can be recreated, we must eventually acknowledge that even partial human awareness must inherently contain all knowledge . It is in recognition of this that the Talmud sates, “ W h o is wise? He who learns from every man.” 12 Though modern scientists tend to think of our ancient ancestors as dumber than we are, all are equal in t his view. We must learn from every human being and every crea ture in creation. The Talmud also states, “Who is wise? He who perceives the future.” 13 The philosophers of times past dreamed in detail ab out our ‘Golden Age’. They frequently made selections of symbols that are still in use today. They (or we) appea r to have been drawing from the same symbol pool. These symbols remain powerful because they transcend time. They mean the same thing in past, pre sent and future. Learning to “drill” to the depths of the meaning of these symbols is at the heart of our quest and takes us to the inner world of our mystic anatomy. One of these primordial symbols, which we will examine in detail, is the caduceus. This symbol -- a central rod with twisting serpents -- represents the medical profession in ancient times just as it does today. This symbol, like others from its pool, has a numbe r of complex underlying or holographic meanings. It take s us to the level of Wisdom."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 4 Presently, we are on the level the Talmud calls Understanding where ideas and individuals exist separately, like shattered notes of a love song or sha rds of a Magic Mirror. While Wisdom is the love song in unity, Understanding is the level where the notes exist se parately. On the level of Wisdom (Nous), the human family is included in a single world soul (Nu, Psyche). One thing seems logical. As scientists ‘play’ the particles (notes) of our human love song (DNA) and thi s new wave of human appears, we will gain additional Wisdom. The God of the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran will, necessarily, ride this wave. Soon, a new (or nu) god of the Second or Nu Genesis will appear on our shores. Hence, presently not only are we playing god we are in the process of making a new god, or God Making."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 5 CHAPTER ONE THE MYTHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE So much of religious and scientific discovery is dependent on timing. If Albert Einstein had attempted to explain his theory of light during the Inquisition he w ould have been burned at the stake or otherwise extermin ated by the Catholic Church. As many as 1,000,000 men, women and children who called themselves Cathars (“Pure Ones”) were murdered by the Church during the Albigensian Crusade because of their belief in a secre t gospel of Jesus that reputedly contained the secret s of light derived from the Crucifixion. Likewise, the true meaning of myth has waited for the discoveries of the priest-wizards of modern science to be perceived and validated. Einstein’s theory took humanity into a new dimensio n, a wonderland populated by black holes and bending lig ht previously imaginable only in children’s stories li ke Alice In Wonderland . Where we once looked into the night and saw only stars, nuclear scientists now see the caul dron of creation brewing within these stars. We have stepped into the Universal Field, the Nu matrix of creation. Correspondingly, where we once looked at the human body from the outside, new scanning technologies such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging allow"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 6 scientists to open a new window into the inner work ings of the human body. We have stepped into ourselves, mapped the human genome, and now see a potential magic tree that wil l return us to God. The question before is this: did ancient physicians have knowledge of DNA? If so, how could they? What insig hts did they perceive which have thus far eluded us? We shall answer these questions as we continue. Equally importantly, we will discover their knowledg e concerning other timeless questions. For example, did they say where our souls came from? Or how the mystery of human life begins? Once a Soul descends (or ascends) the spiral staircase of DNA did th e ancients know how the Soul evolves and transforms a single cell into a Self? Where does the Soul live in the body? Can the Soul heal the body? Can the Soul make the human body more God like? Turning to a modern science or medical book for answers to these questions often leads to a brick w all of arcane terminology. Philosophy books do not fully s atisfy these questions either. Scriptures do not contain the e ntire answer. So where do we turn? How about mythology? The men and women who wrote the myths that explain the internal process of god making had no modern scientific or medical training, yet amazingly, their timeless stories reveal key insights into the workings of the h uman body. These insights illuminate healing techniques an d possible future evolutionary paths for humanity. We do not need medical training to appreciate their brilliance. Many of the myths and scriptures that inv ite us to examine our body parts in a spiritual way are fa miliar in one form or another to most children. As we survey the most fascinating of these myths we shall embark on a fantastic adventure into the heal ing codes"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 7 of the mythic imagination, a nurturing realm of pure m ind. It will give us a glimpse into the so-called ‘ancie nt’ mind as never before. It will also give us new perspectives on healing the human body. Webster’s Dictionary of the English Language defines mythology as “the science of study of myths or legends; that branch of science which investigates the meaning of myths, and the relationship between the myths of different countries or peoples .” 1 The German mythologist Max Muller emphasized the importance of relationships to mythology when he said: “Parts of mythology are religious, parts of mythology are historical, parts of mythology are poetical, but mythology as a whole is neither religion nor history, nor philosophy, nor poetry. It comprehends all these together ...” 2 Though we cannot say for certain what some myths mean, we can say for certainty that the myths of the world are far more similar than they are different. For centuries mythologists have noticed the amazing correspondences between the creation stories of peop le separated by vast distances of space and time. How is it possible that people who have never associated with one another can share identical creation stories and eve n identical words? In their stellar work, Hamlet’s Mill , 3 Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend propose that myth s are similar because they describe celestial events. “As Above. So Below” is one of the best known of all metaphysical truths. It is attributed to the Egyptia n god of wisdom Thoth. Essentially this means that what occu rs in the heavens also occurs on Earth. This is plainly state d in the Lord’s Prayer, “thy will be done, as in Heaven, so in Earth.” 4 From their ancient hilltop temple complexes the anci ent priests and priestesses watched the heavens. They n oticed"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 8 the mathematical regularity of the movements of the heavenly spheres. With this observation came the noti on that all of creation is in order, or cosmos in Greek. The idea that the internal cosmos of the human body was in cosmic order was a natural leap. Could it be these myths and truths are timeless not only because they describe celestial events, but bec ause they also describe inner events? Human anatomy has remained basically the same since c. 100,000 BC. 5 Approximately 40,000 years ago a cultural ‘big bang’ occurred when the linguistic abilities co ded in DNA suddenly emerged. 6 This ‘big bang’ included a great leap forward in art and religion accompanied by astonishing advances in technology and social organization. Since this time civilizations representing billions of people have made their entrance and exit on the stage of Earth. Meanwhile the vehicle through which these souls share their experiences, the human body, has remained essentially the same. So too has the essential theme of art and religion: transcendence, the return to God. My premise is that parts of myth are anatomical. Names and place names, which appear in myth and scripture, are sometimes references to organs and o ther parts of the body and their spiritual function. I will show that when we connect the seemingly unrelated, though identical, words found in various my ths to one another, and to body parts, the true anatomica l meaning of the words and stories emerges. The common thread running through many of these stories is their subject matter: DNA. ‘ON BORDERLAND WE RUN’ The concept of the macrocosm and the microcosm may well be the origins of many religions. The human body is"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 9 literally the bridge or link between the two infinitie s of the incredibly large and the incredibly small. We exist on the borderland between two infinities. As U2’s Bono sang in The Unforgettable Fire , “On borderland we run.” 7 On a clear night we can see billions of galaxies in t he sky. Through a clear microscope we can see billions of molecules, each one comparable to a miniscule galax y. As the bridge, humans realize these are not two worlds, the incredibly large, and the incredibly small, they ar e One. The leap from the stars to the body to the petri dish may seem enormous. However, to the ancient mythmake rs it may have been the basis for all knowledge. Following the As Above. So Below formula, it is possible that the ancients possessed advanced scient ific knowledge about the Soul, the Self and the body (in cluding DNA) and encoded this knowledge, along with star knowledge, in myth. This explains the perennial popularity of certain stor ies and why certain myths ‘hit home’, and are so fascina ting to the human mind. And why the more ancient the myt h, the more often do parts of the human body play an expli cit role. THE STARS INYOUR BODY David Loye stated in The Sphinx and the Rainbow 8 that the number of neurons the human brain has at birth, 100 billion, is approximately the same number of stars in our Milky Way galaxy. When we look to the stars in the night sky we are seeing a powerful model of our own brain in operation. In The Pistis Sophia , a famous Gnostic-Christian gospel that contains what are alleged to be some of Jesus’ esoteri c teachings, Jesus says: “It (the brain) looks to every side and sees itself from itself. Since it is infinite, he is ever incomprehensible. While he is not known, he ever know s"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 2 0 himself. He is immeasurable. He is untraceable. He is perfect having no defect. He is imperishably blesse d.” 9 Jesus was crucified at Gulgotha, the place of the skull . At the base of the human skull we find nerves of regeneration crossing at the junction of the medulla and cerebellum. Correspondingly, the word crucifixion comes from crux or crucis , a cross, and figere , to fasten. 10 Not only was Jesus, fastened or connected to a pillar, but also the process of Crucifixion fastened, fused or connected him to a higher source of Light. This is symbolized in Christian art by a halo of sunlight around his head. Is the crossing point of the medulla and cerebellum the place were the light of the stars is cruci fied within us? Another wonderful illustration of the linkage between the cosmos, the stars Above, and the cosmos Below, the human body, is provided by Joseph Campell 11 and found in the time cycles recorded by priests in the Hindu tradition. The present cycle of time, the Kali-Yuga , is 432,000 years. This number appeared in the writings of the Babylonian priest, astronomer, and historian and Be rossus in c. 280 BC. Berossus recorded that the interval of time between the establishment of the first city, Eridu, an d the disastrous Flood that destroyed the world (as descri bed in the Book of Genesis) was 432,000 years. This suggests a complimentary message in both cultures. When we turn to the inner cosmos of the body we find a striking correspondence. In physical fitness circle s we find the belief that a physically fit person, one wh o exercises regularly, will have a resting heartbeat of about 60 beats per minute or less ... Sixty beats per minut e times 60 minutes, equals 3,600 beats per hour. Times 12 hours, equals 43,200 beats. Times 24 hours, equals 86,400 be ats per day."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 2 1 Interestingly, A-432 is also the piano tuning used by Mozart. Musicologists often speak of the healing qual ity of his music. His special tuning may be one reason why. As the preceding paragraphs illustrate, the most fundamental spiritual anatomy myths very often share a common denominator: a connection to the stars. This connection takes us to the borderland of the ancient mind where we find an overt attempt to draw a connection between the body and the stars. The most prominent myth of our mystic anatomy is th e Egyptian myth of a green-faced god named Osiris who came to Earth from the stars to teach the art of gardening and sought to conquer the world through music. His e vil half brother Set murdered him. His body was cut int o pieces but was resurrected or re-membered by his wi fe Isis, the mistress of all the elements. Like the riddle of ‘Humpty Dumpty’, all the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put Osiris bac k together again. This is so because in ancient Egypt ian myth resurrecting or re-membering the eternal spirit body w as the domain of the goddess! When Isis restored life to the dead Osiris, who was called the Still Heart, she created new life with her hair . 12 What could possibly have been so special about Isis’ hair that could bring her husband, the Still Heart, back to life? The Egyptian tradition also describes how the creato r god, Atum (Atom or Adam), sheds a tear and humanity was created. Atum also produced a bone from a burial place and on this the gods dropped the blood drawn from thei r own bodies. We shall shortly explore this ‘bone’. In Greek myth Pallas-Athena, the goddess of wisdom, was born from the ‘thigh’ of Zeus, a male god. The smith - god Hephaestus aided in this odd caesarian birth with his axe. Aren’t there about a million physicians who wou ld like to see that medical procedure performed?"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 2 2 The Egyptians called the group of stars that we today call Ursa Major the “ Thigh ” or alternately the “Haunch of the Bull.” 13 What ancient star knowledge is concealed within the myths of this body part?

It acts as a net for capturing light or a “light net.” The retina consists of ten layers. Nine have Latin medical names. The tenth is called ‘Jacob’s L ayer’.

Strangely enough, this is indicated by the etymolog y of the word mythology . The word mythology comes from mythos , myth , and logia , to speak. Webster’s 18 says the root my is a shortened form of min , of ME, my, mine, the possessive form of I (or Self). This is fascinating since Min is the root for minister, a conduit between man and God and Minne the name given to Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, by the medieval Min strels or Minne singers, 19 the devotees of Mary Magdalene who introduced the Grail romances to the world. These wandering poets or bards said Minne mean t Love . 20 My-tho-logy therefore means telling the tales of the Word, logia , of min, love . By following the “As Above. So Below” path of truth we learn that mythology is that branch of science that enables us to more fully connect with the Above (st ars) and the Below (the body) with the Goddess’ love. A mythmaker or mythologist is therefore a love maker , which explains why the medieval poets and minstrels called their sacred Grail tales romances . Their predecessors were priests of the Goddess of Love (ME or Min), who gave them the gift of inspiration from her magic cup, the Holy Grail. 21 The minstrel poet was a Druidic bard, one of the fame d men of Hyperboria, the Greek heaven ‘beyond the north wind’.

This is where we learn the story of God’s creation of Adam, the first man, ‘in his own image’ 23 from the clay (or dust) of the Earth 24 and His/Her planting Adam in a garden as a farm worker. 25 This is also where we learn that when God desired to create a companion for Adam S/he put him to sleep and removed one of Adam’s ribs (bones). 26 THE CREATION OF ADAM Variants of this myth of the creation of Adam exist th e world over. Virtually every human knows it. Often, these stories exalt the achievements of a si ngular God. Equally often, as in the book of Genesis, the name of this deity, Elohim , was used in the plural. This odd plural description of God appears thirty t imes in the first five books of the Old Testament and is one of the greatest unexplained mysteries of the Bible. The Elohim themselves are shrouded in mystery. Awareness of their role in creation is essential to our research. El means “Shining One,” and is the name given to God in Genesis 1:1, “In the beginning, God created th e heavens and the Earth.” This is strange. If El means ‘God’ or ‘Shining One’, then Elohim (plural) must mean ‘the Gods’ or ‘the Shining Ones’. Thus, “In the beginning, the Shining Ones created the heavens and the Earth” Or in Genesis 1: 26: And Elohim (the gods) said: “Let us make Man in our image, and our likeness . ”"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 2 7 Thus, “In the beginning, the Shining Ones created the heavens and the Earth”; or, The Shining Ones said, “Let us make man in our image, in the likeness of ourselves ...” That is, “Let us make man a Shining One.” This story could not be clearer. A group of gods go t together and decided to transform humanity from a l ower state to a higher state to match their own image. M ost people think this story of god making is simply an allegory. If so, who were these Shining Ones and what deeper truth lays hidden in this story? One fact has an enormous bearing on the answer to that question: the biblical story of the creation of Adam is not original. The tale of the Elohim’s creation of Adam from “clay” appears first in Sumerian myth in the story of E.A. (pronounced AYA ), the “Lord of the Waters,” and Ninti , the birth goddess who was called the “Lady of Life,” o r “Lady of the Rib” ( ti means both “rib” and “life”). 27 In Sumerian myth, E.A. came to Earth in search of “blue stones” 28 that turn one into an El or Shining One. Ninti and E.A. were the creator(s) of the first human beings, including their first son Adapa , whom they molded out of “clay,” a feat later duplicated by the biblical God with the creation of Adam. E.A., also known as Oannes (“Dove”) was portrayed as a half-man, half-fish god who came from (dove out of) the sea and taught the art of gardening. 29 In the depiction shown here he holds a pail containing the substance of immortality. The Sumerians called E.A. the serpent. The biblical term for “serpent” is nahash , meaning snake. However, it comes from the root NHSH which means “to decipher, to find out.” 30 The Hebrew word for soul, nashamah , comes from the same root.

The meaning of these symbols is quite fascinating from a mythological point of view, and will be elucidated in detail momentarily. Likewise, clay is surely a metaphor for something e lse, but what? What is this clay or earthly material menti oned in both the Hebrew myth of Adam and the Sumerian myth of Adapa? This is a great mystery.

Metaphor combines the two Greek words -- meta, which means “over and above,” and pherein, “to bear across.” 3 2 Metaphors have multiple levels of meaning that are perceived simultaneousl y. Their meanings transcend, or cross over, time and cultures. Studying their accumula ted meanings takes us to the original event or object symbolized by the metaphor. We can begin to identify the true subject of a myth, symbol or metaphor (such as ‘cow’) by paying close attention to the subtle interconnectedness of the def initions of the myriad of proper names and place names containe d within them in English . While this may appear completely random to the scientifically minded, it is actually part of much larg er pattern of intention. Empires may disappear and natio ns may sink into myth under cataclysmic waves of nature a nd invasion, but, says linguist Harold Bayley, 33 place names and proper names , typically preserved by word of mouth, remain to some extent inviolate. In addition to place names and proper names body part names also remain inviolate. The true meaning appea rs when we interpret these names in English. Why English? England is a small island that was constantly invaded throughout history. Because of these incursions by other cultures the English language accumulated many words and expressions from other languages. Because root words, such as Ma, are similar in many languages they retained similar meanings in En glish."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 3 1 An English-speaking mythologist treats a word or metaphor similar to the way a geologist treats a co re sample of soil. Like soil, words are composed of elemen ts (letters) -- called elementum in Latin. Mixing these letters (elements) together, we create language and names for all the objects in our world. In Christian myth Adam named all the objects of creation. Understanding the original meaning of these elements and the words derived from them puts us in direct contact with the nature of the object in question. Words are “time capsules” containing records for the benefit of future generations. These records remain hidden knowledge unless one can succeed in tying a Gordian knot through them, taking the seemingly unrelated pieces of information and connecting them... or seeing that the y are in fact connected. History remains embedded in language. Connecting words in this way creates a “tunneling effect” throu gh time and enables us to “cross over” or “drill through” the timeless metaphors of humanity. Let us apply the techniques of the Language of the Birds to the word “clay” and the metaphor contained therein. We’ll begin by splitting this word’s shell open. The word elements forming the shell of clay are “cl” and “ay.” The elements ‘cl’ and ‘kl’ are phonetically interchangeable (‘clay’ and ‘klay’ sound the same), an d will be defined shortly. First, let’s identify the e lement ‘ay’. We have already encountered this element in name of the Sumerian creator god E.A. or Aya . Today, ‘Ay’ has a variety of meanings including a sound expressing sorrow, distress, and forever. Phonetically ‘ay’ and ‘i’ are interchangeable (I is aye, as in ‘aye aye’, yes, )."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 3 2 The letter Y on its own is an I (Self, Soul) with branches extending from it. Hence, ‘ay’ can also mean I, (and is obviously related to ME). Y is a Self or Soul tha t is branching. Allowing for this substitution, another way to spel l and say Clay (ka-lay) could therefore be Kaly or Kali (pronounced either ka-lie, as in al-kali, or kalay, as in clay). This substitution is fruitful. In Hindu mythology Kali was the name of the birth and death mother who was symbolized by the hungry mother Earth! 34 In Hindu aya is a nursemaid. The ‘clay’ we are made from could therefore be Mother Earth. This is exactly what the Sumerians and the Hebrews maintained in their myth and scripture. The Greeks said much the same thing. Mythologist Barbara Walker notes that Kali was also known Minaksi , the title of the Fish-Eyed goddess of India. This, she says, is the possible origin of Minne (lo ve). 35 The mother goddess Ninti, the goddess of life of the Sumerian genesis story, was also known as a fish godd ess (which the Sumerians called nun ). She made the first humans from clay . Putting the definition of Min as ‘love’ together with Kali as the ‘clay’ from which we are made takes us into a new dimension of wisdom. It tells us we are made from love. GENES: THE THREADS OF CALYPSO In Greek myth Homer referred to Calypso as “she of the braided tresses.” Homer gives the epithet “She of the Braided Tresses” to one other figure in the Odyssey : Circe. Sometimes called “the Spinner,” she was one of the Greek Moerae or Fates; She Who Spins the Thread of Life. The same name was applied to Isis."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 3 3 Calypso is, of course, a clay-based word. It is formed of the elements clay ; pas , to surpass or pass over; and O . Clothos (or Clay- tho) is composed of similar elements. Clotho’s thread was sometimes golden, but more often blood red (hence the word blood clot ). In the 20 th century medical scientists discovered that the clay ( cali or kali ) the human body is made of in Sumerian myth is genes (from gen , to produce). In genetics, genes are any of the elements (‘kali, clay, c ow- rie’) by which hereditary characters are transmitte d and determined. Each cell of the body contains about 100,000 indivi dual genes. The genes contain the record of the cells’ past, as well as a blueprint and map of its future. If we could examine the first cell of life it would l ikely appear something like a human cell. Attached end to end, the genes form chromosomes (from chroma , a color and soma , body), microscopic rod-shaped bodies that carry the “plans” for the whole organism (such as the human body). 36 While on Earth the Soul knits or clads itself in a chroma-colored ‘coat of many colors’; the human body woven or knitted out of this clay. The chromosomes are the red threads of life. They carry detailed information including whether the body will have brown or blue eyes, fair skin or dark, etc. The first cell contains all the genetic information that is required to copy itself build the body. Metaphysically speaking, the Soul grows this cell (or molds this cl ay) into a body as a “ladder to God,” guiding it to maturatio n, through adulthood, through the elderly years, until it finally exits at ‘death’.

Genesis says the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 37"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 3 4 These waters have found their face inside each of us (as proclaimed by the Greek myth of Iris). We are each nu bs of clay that formed ourselves out of the nu bby or knitted fabric of the universe. This is emphasized in the myths of Kore (the root of Kore-An) who was among the earliest names for the female Spirit of the universe (Tula). Variations on this name include words we are, by now, quite familiar: Ker, Car, Core, and the Sanskrit Kaur (pronounced ‘cowr’), an alternate name for the Cow Goddess Kali (or Kow-li). 38 In Hindu mythology Kali was the name of the birth and death mother who was symbolized not only by the cow but also by the hungry Mother Earth. Archaeologists have found cowrie shells dating back as far as 20,000 BC. These were placed on the skeletons of the dead and represented the divine vulva. They co nveyed the idea of rebirth. THE GAIA PRINCIPLE The Greeks called the Great Cow Mother Gaia or Gaea (pronounced GUY-AH) and said she not only created humanity, but also created the universe and the gods (just like Kore). As Ge (pronounced je , as in ga-en ) her name has survived as the root of terms like ge -nesis, ge -ology, ge -ometry, ge -ography, and ge -netics. I find it fascinating that at exactly the same time 20 th century scientists began unraveling the secrets of D NA -- the clay and blood of the Earth -- they also began to t alk openly about the Gaia principle after the Greek name for Mother Earth.

This is why the beautiful blue-white object floating innocently in the blackness of space beside its star was simultaneously the birth-and-death Mother, a womb a nd tomb. Because she temporarily robbed the Soul of its cosm ic freedom Kali was called Kali-Tari, the Terrible Mot her or Mother of Terror. Kali-Tara became the Latin Terra , “Mother Earth.” 40 Some of Kali’s older names appeared in the Bible an d reflect this sentiment. As Tara, Kali became Terah , (terror) mother of the Hebrew ancestral spirits. The Bible says Abraham, Jesus’ ancestor, was the son of Terah.

THE MEANING OF CLITORIS This life/death duality is noticeably captured in the original meaning of the word clitoris ( cali -toris), from the Greek kleitoris (pronounced ‘clay-toris’), “divine, goddess-like.” In the 2 nd century AD the Greeks said the city of Clitor was sacred to the Mother Earth goddess, and stood at the genital shrine of the Earth, the headwaters of the Sty x, the Greek river of life. 42 The true meaning of this geographical myth is made cl ear (or clay-er, as it is pronounced in Tennessee) by the ancient belief that the River Styx represented Moth er Earth’s (Kali’s) menstrual blood. The souls of the dead crossed the River Styx into the underworld (the womb). In European myth, the ka , the hidden twin-soul, was thought to lay in the blood of t he umbilical cord, the lifeline connecting a fetus with the placenta of the mother. Great care was taken to prese rve this lifeline after birth. Life begins when the penis enters the clitoris. Ser pent- shaped sperm is ejaculated into the ovum. The Soul crosses the River Styx and clads itself in a vehicle: the human body made out of the Mother’s clay, DNA. The first cell begins to multiply, or clone itself.

Christianity speaks of a ‘fall’ of man, a separation of the seed from the tree, God. Fascinatingly, with the addition of a ‘u’, cl becomes ‘cul’ which means ‘to separate’. Cl or cull is also the root of such words as cult (to worship) cultivate (to grow) and culture (to care). ‘Cl’ is also the root of the medical term clone or klone , which is a Greek word meaning ‘twig’. Today, a clone refers to a genetic copy. A twig is to a tree as a cell is to a human, separate, but one. Putting the definitions of cl together with those of ay , I or Self, renders clay as: 1. To separate from the I or Soul. 2. To worship, grow, care or clone the I or Soul. The concept of the human family tree (also called a cladogram ), with branches forming and diverging in many directions is a popular metaphor for humanity. However, it also reveals one spiritual and genetic imperative. To use a metaphor drawn from our earlier discussion, one of our spiritual missions is to tur n our individual I’s of Self’s into a collective family t ree or Y. In summary, correctly understood mythology is the branch of science that assists the Soul in relating to life clad in the clay of Kali or Earth. The diligent student of mythology also discovers th at this science provides instruction in how to use the hu man body as a “ladder” or “tree of life” to “shoot” or “branch” ourselves back to God.

Many hav e thought that all matter was composed of rainbows beca use, when the sun hit an object (skin, hair, plants, wat er, stones) just right, it revealed millions of tiny rainbows. The Greeks said the rainbow symbolized the Goddess Iris, “Source of the waters from on high,” mother of Love. 9 Like the part of the eye named for her, Iris was the Core,Kaur or Kore of all existence. 10 In Greek myth, she was the World Soul (Nu) animating each human soul, and looking out of the eyes.(BWS, p. 515) This may explain why Ma (Tula) was worshipped along the banks of the Iris. 11 It is in the eye (I) that we find the borderland betwee n Earth and Heaven.

At the center of this heaven ‘beyond t he north wind’ was Tula, the Druid mecca for learning. Whenever we see the T-L-A letter combination in a word or sprinkled throughout a word it is a reference t o Tula. Like the Hebrew scribes, the Druid Bards were maste rs of word play and the mixing of word elements. Identif ying the T-L-A elements of Tula embedded within key mythic names and place names helps us to uncover the sacred teachings of the galactic core and DNA hidden in many myths and religions. For example, the Tula connection to the cow is explicitly made in the word “Italy” or “I- TAL -Y. Italy means “calf-land.” 12 The Etruscans called the Milk-giver Lat . The Arabs called her L-at , Al-lat or Allah . When we go to a coffee shop today and order a latte we are using a Lat-in word for the milk of Tula. The book of Job 13 directly refers to the cow’s role in creation in ancient myth when it asks: “Has thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?” This question coincides with the ancient myth that the cow goddess’, Tula’s, star-milk formed the curds (note this word) to create worlds (words) and creatures. 14 The old legend that the Moon is made of green cheese comes from the legends of the Moon’s creation as a ball of cheese curdled from the Milky Way. The white cow whose udder (utter) produced the star- rivers was the same cow who “jumped over the Moon” in nursery rhyme. There used to be mystery schools called Tula all over the planet -- in Egypt, India, the Americas where p hysicians of the soul could gather to learn the way of god making and the means to become ‘one’ with God, and hence “new” or “numan beings.”"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 4 9 Among the earliest and most renowned of these resurrection mystery schools were those of the Egyptia n cow goddess Isis. God making was her business. The myth and science of Tula was the core of this teach ing. Much is to be learned about the core of existence, and the galactic core, by studying the many Egyptian myths of Isis. With these myths in mind, let us explore what modern astronomy has discovered about this region of space . THE HEALING WATERS A few brave souls have ventured into Tula’s territo ry in our modern era. University of Arizona astronomers, using a new high-speed, infrared camera mounted on a Kitt P eak telescope, have been “feeling” their way around Tula recently. They believe they have discovered a black h ole inhabiting the area near the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Physicists believe this may be Kerr -type (named after Roy Kerr) or rotating black hole. 15 Theoretically, physicists view Kerr-type black holes as time machines that may open gateways to parallel dimensions. Unfortunately, these celestial bodies, due to their small size and staggering gravitational force s, draw in all surrounding materials on a one-way course towar d their centers. Therefore, venturing toward a black hole is dangerous business. Not even light escapes its grasp -- hence, the name black hole . Who would want to venture to a black hole? Practica lly speaking no one. That’s why theoretical physicists invented something else to inhabit the galactic cor e, something which changes the picture considerably. That something is called a white hole , a “cosmic gusher” of matter and energy. 16 If for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, and our premise is tha t humans are programmed to go back “home”; perhaps th at is the reason physicists were driven to discover Tu la."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 5 0 In physics circles it is said that, whatever a black hole can devour, a white hole can spit out.

The idea of a four-fold spring of souls emerging fro m a common center is found in the Garden of Eden story in Genesis: “ And a river (of souls) went out from Eden (the center of the galaxy) to water the garden (galaxy) ; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. ” 1 7 (author’s amplification in parenthesis) In Genesis, the river of souls is called Hiddekel 18 which is a copy of the Akkadian name of the Milky Way, Hiddagal , or “River of the Divine Lady.” Sun-Crosses symbolize souls fanning out into four directions from Tula."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 5 2 The Nordic Edda confirms four streams of souls came from a central fountain -- in the home of the gods. The Hindu V-Eddas texts describe a fourfold head spring of all waters (souls?) at “the center of heaven.” The Sun-Cross, also known as the Cross of Light, Rose Cross or the enclosed Sun Cross, depicts the f our life streams fanning out from Tula. The Sun-Cross is one of the oldest symbols known to man. It appears prominently in many religious traditions as the symbol for Eart h. Originally, it served as the symbol of the starry H oly Land, from whence our souls are said to have originated. According to the Vedas, “what the sun and light are t o this visible world, that are the supreme good and tr uth to the intellectual and visible universe; and as our co rporeal eyes have a distinct perception of objects enlightened by the sun, thus our souls acquire certain knowledge, by meditating on the light of truth which emanates from th e Being of Beings (the O): that is the light by which alone our minds can be directed in the path to beatitude .” 19 Tula was the source of creation. It is the light beyo nd the darkness of space. One important object of Earth life, according to myth, is to find the connecting link that will enable our soul to connect with and return to this core ‘beyond the nort h wind’. In the mysterious Jewish alchemical text, The Bahir, 20 Teli is the name of this connecting link. It is often described as a pillar or pole (an I) between Earth and Heaven. As a Jewish mystic Jesus likely would have studied The Bahir , and therefore, would have known the secret of the Teli . Teli is from talah (TLA or TULA). Significantly, another way to look at Teli (or TLI) is in Roman numeral s where: T=300, L=50, and I=10. TLI, therefore, is 360.

In the book of Genesis humankind gathered together in Babylon (present day Iraq) to build a city and a tower (a Teli, column, I or ladder) that rea ched into the Heavens (Tula?). The gods destroyed the to wer and separated humanity by language. Presumably, Adam, Eve, Noah and his family, and the other inhabitants of the pre-flood civilization spoke the same language, a universal language, such as Englis h is today. This continued with the re-establishment of civilizat ion after the cataclysm. During the time of the Babel incident “the whole Ear th was of one language, and of one speech.” 1 This single fact has such an important bearing on our understanding of the Babel story, and ultimately the secrets of our myst ic anatomy, that it is relevant to briefly describe it i n some detail.

Through th is Language Adam and Eve were given “dominion” over nature in Genesis 1:26. The Bible never identifies this speech. However, for millennia linguists, mystics, scientists, military and religious types have searched for this Mother Tongu e. This language has everything to do with what transpired at Babel when the descendents of the survi vors of the flood were separated by language. Until that time, humanity was unified by language. According to the Koran, this primordial language wa s called the Language of the Birds. 2 The alchemists called it the Green Language, 3 the language of nature. Its letters, or more precisely the tones, vibrations or frequencies b ehind these symbols, are said to be the building blocks of Creation. An ancient Jewish legend indicates that if one were pure and holy enough, and understood the combination of the Hebrew symbols, one could create life and contro l the matter of the universe. One would be a master of Crea tion, a god-like being. Linguistic unity -- or knowing the Language of the Birds and the secrets of creation -- apparently gav e Noah’s descendents great power and ambition. Gathering at Babel they collaborated to build a cit y and a tower that enabled them to “cross over” the rainb ow waters of immortality by “drilling holes” in space, and enter the core of Heaven, Valhalla (or the Vale of Allah/Tula). Perhaps only Solomon who built a Templ e as an earthly home for the Holy Spirit matched this am bition. Observing this offensive initiative into their doma in, the gods immediately destroyed this tower. As the book of Genesis records, “The people are one, and they all have one language! This is but the start of what they will do. Now nothing will be impossible for them, which they have imagined to do .”"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 5 7 “Let us go down there and confound their language, that they might not understand one another’s speech .” 4 With the god’s action, the builders are forced to abandon their tower and cease their ascension to Hea ven. Why was humanity denied entrance into Heaven? Why was the building of the Tower of Babel taken with such great offense by the gods? The real nature of the offense may have been revealed in Genesis 3:22. It was Adam’s partaking of the fruit “ i n the midst of the garden” which gave him the ability to create life, thus making him “one of us,” that is equal to the gods. Legend says the fruit was an apple. Every app le has a core, and we shall shortly get to the core of this apple. The existence of this universal language of creatio n and its destruction is the innermost secret contained i n the story of the Tower of Babel. Some believe the Language of the Birds was created miraculously by God as a gift to Adam. With this la nguage Adam (atom) was given command over the elements of nature. It could not be read or understood without knowing the symbolic key. With the key in hand, one would gain access to the nuclear secrets of scripture, and to the secrets of creation, the Book of Life. The Language of the Birds was thought to have been lost when Adam and Eve were evicted from the Garden of Eden. The recovery of this language would allow, amon g other things, re-entry to the Garden and access to the tremendous powers of creation. Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch and ancestor of Jesus, reportedly learned this language two thousand years before Jesus. According to the Sefer Yetzirah , 5 the phenomenal mystic ‘hidden scrolls’ of the Jewish tradition, Abr aham used his knowledge to make souls at a place called Harran (‘the land of holes’)."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 5 8 The next place we find the use of this language is in a tradition regarding the older sons of Jacob, Abraham ’s grandson, which states they used it to create animals and human maid servants. 6 These chronicles infer that parts of this nuclear language are medical in nature. It is within the realm of possibility that the ‘element s’ of this language included the four letters of the human genome, A,C,T and G. According to the Kore-An, another of Jesus’ ancestor s, the poet-King Solomon, recovered this language ( c. 1,000 BC). It gave him tremendous power, including the ab ility to transmute the elements and to fly like a bird... or an angel. It was said he placed these secrets within the (s) tones (or keys) of his Temple in Jerusalem. KNOCKING ON HEAVEN’S DOOR As we will explore in more detail later, Solomon’s Temple, like many Egyptian temples, was equipped wit h a miraculous portal. 7 Into the solid masonry of these chapels stone slabs called stela were set or carved. These stela were considered doorways into the divin e dimension. They were gateways permitting instantane ous communication between Earth and the heavens. Ordinary mortals could not ‘walk through’ these doo rs or ‘on the waters’ of immortality, but the blessed de ad, the living king, as well as priests and other initiates, co uld toggle between the dimensions via these doorways. The ancient beliefs concerning these stone stela and their ‘doors’ to Heaven expound on the secrets of the Tower of Babel. Babel comes from Baal , the Old Testament word for Lord. Babel also means ‘gate’. According to most Bibl e translators, the reason mankind built the Tower of Ba bel was to make a “name” or “renown” for themselves:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 5 9 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens , and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad the fac e of the whole Earth” 8 (emphasis added) With the omission of the letter b Babel becomes the Tower of Bael or Baal. This small omission yields a rather large coincidence. Long before the Tower of Babel, Ba al, the son of E.A., had installed a magical “ stone that whispers ”-- a talking stone -- in the temple at Baalbek, Lebanon. The massive pad of this temple features 1,200 ton (!) blocks (that cannot be moved to this day). 9 One of these stones of Baalbek is 60 feet long, and 12 feet thick and is placed in a wall at least 20 feet from the ground! Interestingly, Psalm 29 lists Lebanon (Baalbek?) as one of the four places where the ‘voice of God’ was heard. This is quite fascinating, as the ME stones were known as the “whispering stones,” or “stone of secrets” o f God. Local legends claim Adam and his oldest son Cain (whose name means ‘smith’) placed these stones here in cooperation with the “giants” (the Shining Ones) who were later destroyed by the biblical Flood. 10 There is only one purpose such massive stones can serve, says Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin. They are a platform for the take-off and landing of the chariots of the gods. In The 12 th Planet , 11 Sitchin claims that an error has been made in the translation of the word shem , or name, which when properly understood radically changes the meaning of the Tower of Babel episode. According to Sitchin, the Hebrew word sh-em originally signified not “name” or “renown,” but “ that which goes up .” 12 A similar misinterpretation occurs in Genesis 6:4 where it says: “The Nephilim (Shining Ones) were on Earth in those days, and also afterward, when the so ns of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 6 0 God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men of old, t he men of renown.” Sitchin interprets shem as a spacecraft or rocketship. If this radical observation proves true, would not this difference in interpretation revolutionize Earth hi story? According to Sitchin, the shem was the cone-shaped command capsule called the beth-el (“house of God”) by the Hebrews, the betyl (“stone”) by the Canaanites, and the ben ben by the Egyptians. 13 These traditions are certainly of interest. What is more interesting is the fact that the ben ben was housed at Heliopolis, a city whose hieroglyph was a tower, and was considered the first ‘home of the gods’.

Located just across the Nile from Giza and the pyram ids, Heliopolis was the center of Egyptian religion. It is a place of enormous mystery. In Isaiah 30:4, the city of Maturea or Heliopolis, is called hns ; in the Vulgate, Hanes . This city became Heliopolis . This is the city of the PhiHN, PHEN, 14 or the PhoeNix, also called On or An . The Greek Heliopolis means “City of Helios,” the sun god Helios being the sun/son of An or Anu. Sume rian texts record An is one of the names of E.A.’s home (Marduk) and the name of his mother and father.

No matter how bizarre these considerations and connections may at first seem they lead inescapably to a powerful question. Does the tower symbol in the Tower of Babel episode actually refer to the recreation of the Teli or tower reaching to Tula? Did Solomon duplicate this temple in Jerus alem?

The myths these writings describe are recollections of an earlier time the ancient Egyptian s considered ancient! The focal point of the Pyramid Texts was the prehistoric mound of A-tum at Heliopolis (Tula). 16 In Egyptian cosmology time was composed of recurrent cycles. In other words, history repeated itself. At the beginning of each new age, or commencement of a new cycle, the heron would alight from the Central Sun, Tul a, and would land a top the Pillar on the mound of A-tum at Heliopolis. 17 Fascinatingly, the Mayans called Tula the ‘place of herons’. The white heron is the Toltec hieroglyphic for Atzlan, the primeval island Atlantis. 18 The Egyptians regarded the heron as a cosmic emissary, the embodiment of the Divine Word. Christia ns ascribed this role to Jesus, and symbolized him by th e phoenix, as well as the fish. The phoenix and fish symbols prompt us to interpret Jesus’ teachings in light of t he earliest myths of god making. To the Egyptians the heron and the phoenix were interchangeable symbols. Both symbols referred to a person. Fascinatingly, bethula is the Old Testament word for virgin. Literally translated it means “beth” vessel of “thula” tula . From its outstretched arms (with its body forming a Y) the heron would radiate light and then deliver a teac hing (symbolized by the Key of Life below) designed to transform humans into herons.

Once ignited the Christ Light of Amor or Love, like a new flood, would submerge all s ouls and never again would blood be shed on this Earth.

Therefore it was necessary that Adam be degraded an d made mortal, “lest he put forth his hand and take al so the Tree of Life and eat and live forever .” The citizens of Babylon were degraded and separated by language. It is quite possible that Jesus (the phoenix or heron) sought to recover the Bird language and re-unite hu manity with the pillar and its fruit (the ME stones) that tu rned one into a god. Once we are gods, it appears we spend e ternity sailing the waters of space in bodies or vehicles of li ght that strangely resemble UFOs.

From the stories and religious artwork we have investigated thus far, these secrets revolve around a ME Pillar of Love linking Heaven and Earth that is tende d by a fish god and/or goddess. Why is linguistic unity and the secrets of the pillar/tower that accompany it withheld from humani ty? Mystics claim the reason is that the Language of the Birds has as its primary component the ability to t ransmute the elements. This includes the four elements of creation (earth, air, fire and water) as well as the Periodic Tabl e of Elements. The ability to transmute the elements allows one to play god with the stuff of creation, to compose new ‘songs’. One component of this language most certainly is biological. I presume it is the language of the genes, DNA and human anatomy.

The key symbol accompanying the Mer-Ka-Ba vehicle is the Pillar of Lov e which could “drill holes” in space. Scientists have recently concluded we only perceive ten percent of the universe. 4 The rest is “dark,” invisible to humans. Is Jesus asking us find the means to open our spiritual vision to “drill holes” into this darkness?

T his is another name for the ME Tablets. These tablets were discovered by Abraham’s wife, Sarah, who wandered into a ‘cave’ and discovered th ese Stones at the feet of Hermes, who at the time was i n a state of suspended animation. Significantly, after this encounter Abraham and Sara h each received an ‘H’ in their name from the Lord Melchizedek who initiated them in the mysteries of the blood and wine of the Eucharist. 7 The Hebrew letter ‘heh’"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 7 7 is a pictogram of a window in ancient Hebrew. Its mean ing is Breath of Life. 8 The ‘H’ signified the acquisition of knowledge of the “H or Ladder to Heaven.” A single white H on a blue background appears frequently on signs that dot the highways of America. This H always means hospital , and represents a place that offers the most advanced medical technology in the world. Similarly, in the mystic mind of the Gnostics at the time of Jesus, the H represented a group of advanced intertwined healing sciences that combined to form the secrets of the Grail. These healing sciences combined to form what I will call the science of salvation . The way to exit the Earth was to find the Ladder to Heaven which angels ascended and descended. The eig hth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Cheth, symbolized this ladder. The picture of Cheth shows two pillars united by one crossbeam, resembling a doorway. Two other simil ar symbols are He (Head) and Tau (Cross). Only Cheth represents the two pillars in perfect balance. Cheth, at the end of words, is pronounced “ach” or H. The initiate walked between two of the columns of H -- or I I -- to enter the Grail temple. Within the tem ple he was confronted by two more pillars before entering the Holy of Holies. 9 These two pillars, topped by the crossbeam, indicated that the initiate had balanced the inner duality of light and dark. This letter resembles the ancient erections of stone, including Stonehenge, found throughout the ancient world. It is used to denote the number 8. The Hebrew letter Heth means “a field of cosmic possibilities,” and symbolica lly represents the union of two worlds. 10 In the view of salvation scientists the soul in volves itself in the field of human experience, the matrix or matter of earth life, and e volves out of it.

We are figure 8’s in our skeletal structure, emphasized by the eight joints of our limbs. Our vertical skeletal structure, coupled with the rungs of our spinal cor d system, forms an inner “Ladder to Heaven.” In Greek ladder is klimax . At the climax of our life, we reach into Heaven. The 8 below joins the 8 above. Many Gnostic Christian scholars believe that Jesus drew wisdom from the ancient wisdom wells of Egypt, India and Sumeria. Based upon this I speculate that the 8 or H of the Eucharist is an encoded description of the experience of the healing and transformation of the h uman body and the expansion of the human mind in preparati on for linking with Heaven. To pass from Earth to Heaven requires the passage of seven rungs of initiation into a higher eighth in ma ny traditions.

For the moment, I wish to emphasize that all the different aspects of the H , 8 and ladder symbolism bring us back to the central goal of the Grail mysteries: h ow to tame the ‘dragons within’, find the gate to Heaven an d transform ourselves into a being capable of entering this gate. The bulk of the myths used to explain this process o f climbing the Ladder to Heaven are derived from Sumer ian, Egyptian, Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian myth. Properly understood, these myths describe the step- by-step procedures for increasing awareness, love , and attaining enlightenment, revelation , the two goals of the Grail mysteries. These procedures were artfully and intentionally disguised using figurative terminology so as to be transparent to all but the initiated. Throughout thi s book I am working from the premise that the most significa nt mythological tales originally had a foundation in astronomy, and physiology. THE H AND THE MER-KA-BA In Hebrew mysticism this H ladder is called the Sephiroth , the Mystical (Magic) Tree. It features ten qualities as set forth in the Sefer ha-Zohar , the Cabalistic Book of Splendour . Cabalists called all ten collectively the Merkaba , or “chariot of god.” According to Jewish legend, this was the initiation Abraham and Sarah received. 10 This system of mystical science is also known as the Kaballah or Sabala (since the soft ‘c’ and the ‘s’, are interchangeable so too are the letters ‘s’ and ‘k’ are interchangeable)."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 8 1 Sephiroth, the Magic Tree of Life or Portal of Ligh t"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 8 2 In Art and Symbols of the Occult , James Waserman writes that the word Kaballah “comes from the Hebrew root QBL , meaning ‘to receive’, and refers to the passing down of secret knowledge through an oral transmission.” 12 The Kaballah, it is claimed, was taught by God to a chosen few of Angels in Paradise. In the Book of Genesis, 13 after God banished Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden He placed cherubims to guard the gate of re-entry to Paradise, and a revolving, flaming (s) word to guard the Tree of Life.

This book “wherein all celestial and earthly knowledge is set down” has been handed down. An oral version still e xists -- the Sabala or Kaballah . Interestingly, Sa means ‘holy blood of Isis’ in Egyptian. 14 Ba means soul. Many mystics link the Jewish Sabala with the Gnostic Emerald (S)tones, with the Holy Grail: the means to enable the soul to return home. From our investigation we can see why. Each allows users to open doorways to other realms that had once been sealed by God. Those who acquired the H, including Abraham, Sarah and Jesus H. Christ, received a state or frequency of holy blood that included the shamanistic power to toggle between or open gates separating the “inner” and the “outer” worlds. Sephiroth comes from the Hebrew word for sapphire. 15 King Solomon’s ring, which was credited with the ab ility to cut open anything and to heal wounds, was made of blue sapphire. This is fascinating in light of the title of Hildegaard’s painting of Nous, “the man in sapphire blue.” Hildegard decribes this illumination as: “A most quiet light and in it burning with a flashing fire from of a man in sapphir e blue.” 16 The man is the Holy Spirit, binding and connecting all to the “web of the universe” as Hildegar d described it, with his divine hands.

It was the substance of God’s throne. 18 The Authorized Version inaccurately translates sappur as ‘sapphire’. This indicates that what The Book of the Angel Raziel meant to say was that the Sephiroth, and its instruction manual inscribed on the blue sapphire sto ne, taught the means to transform ordinary blood into t he holy blood. This is quite phenomenal. Sapphire was often given as a medicine. It was considered a virtuous stone, by wh ich wonders could be worked. Star sapphires were called Stones of Destiny. The (S)tone of Destiny was one of the gifts the Tuatha de’ Danann brought to Earth with them in Celtic lor e. They are symbolically equivalent to the ME stones or Tablets of Destiny of E.A.

The tesseract is a symbol for hyperdimensional physics, which imagines a higher dimension beyond our own as the source for all matter. According to the Sabalists, the Sefer Yetzirah has 32 paths of Wisdom. They correspond with the 31 nerves t hat emanated from the spinal cord (plus the 32nd which corresponds to the entire cranial nerve complex.) 20 The number 32 is the fifth power of two (2 5 ). 21 Thus, the 32 paths correspond to the number of apexes on a fi ve dimensional hypercube, or a tesseract. 22"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 8 5 Tesseract.

This explanation of the tesseract gives new light to the legend that Abraham possessed the ME tablets and the Biblical account of his meeting with the Lord.

The “ Book of the Letters ” is an obvious reference to the Book of Life of DNA and its four letters. This also hints that Abraham (and even Jesus) was quite possibly a chemist, an alchemist or even a geneticist. The Theosophists, Charles Leadbeater and Annie Besant demonstrated one explanation for how Abraham and Jesus could see into matter and manipulate it in their landmark work “Occult Chemistry.” 26 The elements have definite shapes. Much of chemistry work depends on being able to determine these shapes. Leadbeater and Besant began their work on the a-tom, the elements and the nature of matter in 1895 and compl eted it in 1933. They used a method of “clairvoyant microscopy” or “psychic seeing” to open a window through which to peer into the workings of nature and to see these shapes. This ability is among the eight sidhis reportedly learned by adepts in India, including Jesus. The Yoga who learned animan, has the ability to make oneself infinitely small at will.

Certain results and details from these accounts suggest they achieved feats matched only by modern physicists with the most advanced equipment. It is through this special hyperdimensional sight, I propose, that the ancients also learned the secrets of the Book of Letters, DNA. The best way to understand the basics of mystical hyper-dimensional sight is to begin by gazing at a thre e dimensional cube. In 1832, a Swiss naturalist named L.A. Necker drew the three-dimensional cube seen here on a piece of pape r and noticed that its perspective had an odd way of reversing itself. One moment the face that seemed t o be in front would suddenly flip to the back and the back’s f ace would suddenly flip to the front.

Now, le t us add another dimension by noting that, to the ancien ts, these stones may well be God. The God of Israel, says Moses, “is a rock, his work is perfect.” 1 In Deuteronomy Moses calls God, “the Rider of the Heavens.” The word “rider,” rokhev , is closely related to markava or merkaba , the mystical chariot of light Ezekiel and Jesus. He continues, “As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings , taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord a lone did lead him.” 2 Here, in one astonishing breath, the poet has idealize d God as a Rock or (S)tone and as an Eagle . This is because the two words are related. Roc or rukh was Arabian and rekh was Egyptian for the giant eagle or phoenix , the bird of rebirth and resurrection and a symbol of the savior in Egypt and in Christianity. As noted, in Egypt, the phoenix and the heron are interchangeable. The rock and the phoenix (heron) ar e the same. They both symbolize the Atum. Assuredly, this was in reference to the heron being the bird of resurrection and ascension which is sacred to t he"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 0 1 Hebrews, and Christians as the phoenix, the symbol of the returning Christ or Messiah (ME-ssiah). Like the God who “rides” the heavens in Deuteronomy, the heron leaves its natural state and al lows itself to be seen on Earth. This process is depicted in this illustration which features gods and a goddess before the ME (s)tone pillar of love. A Mer-Ka-Ba vehicle hovers above. This story element became the corner stone of the Hebrew concept of the ME-ssiah (first prophesied by Ezekiel) and the Christian concept of Christ. The Greek word for stone is Cephas or Kephas . Kephas is from Ke-phalos (phonetically Key-Phallus), meaning head . (Note the phallic shape of the pillar above.) This is the original name for St. Peter (from petros , meaning ‘rock’), the Galilean fisherman who became Jesus’ chief disciple and the (rock) Head upon whic h Christ will build his church. 3"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 0 2 By this interpretation, the (S)tone is the Head of the Church. To Christians, Christ, not Peter, is the missi ng stone or Head of the Church. Christ is depicted as the eye or I of light on the back of the one dollar bill. This idea of the corner-stone is the foundation of Freemasonry. It is unintelligible unless one realiz es that the ‘corner-stone’ refers to the key stone of the Freem asonic arch, itself a reference to the Rainbow Bridge of the goddess Isis. As we have seen in the previous chapt er, this stone and the “Bridge of Love” is built from within us. Fascinatingly, the King’s Chamber and the Queen’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid stand in relation to eac h other as do the pineal gland and pituitary gland of the brain. The subterranean system underneath the Pyram id represents the solar plexus. The Great Pyramid is situated exactly on the geographical center between Upper and Lower Egypt. The solar plexus is the dividing line between the upper body and the lower body, called Lower Egypt."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 0 3 As we will see in later chapter, the solar plexus corresponds with the Ark of the Covenant, the golden container that housed the Tablets or (S)tones of God. This tone is taken up to the brain by the nerves or branches of the Pneumo gastric nerve, and becomes the “fruit of the Tree of Life” in the pineal gland. Pineal was the nam e of the place where Jacob saw God face to face. Once again, we are asked to consider that God is represented by a (S)tone, i.e. a key, vibration or a song. Moses even complained that the Israelites had forgotten this: “Of the Rock that begat thee thou are unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee,” said Moses. 4 In the next chapter 33:26-27 Moses writes: “There is none like the God of Jeshurun The Rider of the Heavens is your Helper His pride is in the skies. A Dwelling is the God of eternity And below are the Arms of the Universe .” This message is delivered after Moses blesses all the twelve tribes of Israel. Its mystical and anatomical overtones are unmistakable. In addition, its tone is astronomical. The Hebrew wor d for God’s place of ‘dwelling’ is Me’onah . Hebrew mystics claim this term comes from ME-ON or MA-ON and indicates a level above space and time (hyperspace), the “place of the universe.” ME-ON me ans ME, love (s)tone, of ON, Heliopolis. Ma-on is also the root for the Moon. 5 The accumulation and interchangeability of these definitions render God as a (s)tone that came from a level above space and time; who lives in the Moon; and who is the Moon."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 0 4 The ancients had a very good explanation for the substitution of these definitions. In Sumerian myth the ME tablets were given to Kingu , the firstborn son of the creatress Tiamat. Kingu was the Sumerian name for our Moon . He was slain by Marduk, the god of Babylon, and his blood made the Earth’s “living waters.” Humanity, in turn, was made from thes e “living waters,” which were the original “matter “ of Tiamat. 6 The ancient Hebrews called the Moon Sin . The Old Testament statement that “man is conceived in sin” has a missing meaning. The real meaning of the term has to do with the light of the Moon. The word sin comes from Schin, the twenty-first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and means to fall short of completeness, or understanding, wisdom. The ancient Hebrews called the Moon Sin because it gave light onl y part of the time. One object of earth life was to overcome sin, the l ack of wisdom, and build a Bridge of Love to the higher re alms so that we could make up for the lack of light. The Optic Thalamus, meaning “light of the chamber” 7 is the inner or third eye, situated at the center of the head (and at t he top of the pyramid above). It connects the pineal gland and the pituitary body. The optic nerve starts from this “eye single” or “All seeing eye.” “If thine eye be single, thy whole body will be full of light.” The Optic Thalamus is called a “lamp,” and indicates “rays,” “light,” or “vibration.” 8 By activating the third eye millions of dormant cells of the brain are resurrec ted and set in motion (vibration). The brain is attuned to higher spiritual vibrations (love beyond love). The Eye of s piritual understanding is opened. Sin is overcome. The outer eyes see only by reflection. The inner eye sees by vibration, feeling.

Frequently, this will lead to an ‘aha’ experience in which we exclaim, “Oh, yes, now I see .” This illumination turns on a vibration within. The blood is the carrier of this vibration. As we w ill see in a later chapter, the “oil” that lights this ‘aha lamp’ is secreted from a gland housed in our inner Ark of the Covenant located in the sacral (from sacred or secret ) region near the base of the spinal column. This gland is known as the Kundalini and in the New Testament, Greek, as the Kardia. 9 When secreted this oil is an illuminating substance that makes its way out thr ough the capillaries into the blood and passes all over th e body. This is the “blood of Christ,” the lamb or lamp of God which takes away the sins (ignorance) of the world. THE BLOOD OF THE GODS Throughout the ages a few initiates have known how to turn on their inner lamp and multiply this life essence in the blood. The ‘hidden’ or occulted aspects of the ME (and me-dicine) and the myths of the spilling of the bl ood of the god (Christ) and the goddess reveal that this has everything to do with the Moon and a level above space and time. In the Essene tradition Christos was a title, the meaning of which is “healing moon man,” fitting the Hebrew tradition of Jesus as the son the Virgin Mary, th e almah or “moon-maiden.” 10 Is this remarkable, or is it expected? In Sumeria the myths of the blood are inextricably linked with the myt hs of E.A. the serpent of wisdom, his ME stones and the Moon. Once we uncover the key icons of these blood myths (the Pillar or rod of Love, the Moon, the eagle, the heron and the Key of Life) we discover that they are found in some of the oldest art of the world."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 0 6 Virtually every aspect of the story of Jesus, which is a story of god making, has antecedents going back thousands of years. The assumption that little prec eded Jesus hides from us the Fountain of Truth that anima ted his role as a Sin bearer. Every civilization I have mentioned, Egypt, Sumer, India is late in the day, and each presented a slain an d cannibalized savior who presented powerful healing secrets to his people. Often these secrets are represented by some object (usually a stone) guarded by a serpent or dragon, sometimes near a tree. This object and tree often s ymbolize the gateway to Heaven, the point where communication is established between Heaven and Earth and immortality is achieved. The discovery of this gateway to Heaven is the ultima te reward that is yielded by understanding of these saviors, the Language of the Birds. It was believed the Lang uage of the Birds could bio-physically reprogram the human body to a higher (or lighter) being capable of entering th is gateway. The Nordic people emphasized the necessity of humankind’s struggle with the serpent to unite Heav en and Earth. We read of heroes who, having vanquished the serpent or dragon, like Siegfried in the Nordic leg end, taste the dragon’s blood and instantly understand the Langua ge of the Birds. Victory over the serpent changes Siegfried’s destiny, allowing him to achieve his heart’s desire (the lovely and beautiful maiden Brunhilda). 11 The Nordics believed that recovering the poetic Language of the Birds (or bards) would permit entry into the realm of the gods and angels -- the secret Garden of Creation of the ancestors.

TIAMAT The key symbols we are looking for are found in the olden texts where the ancients tell us Tiamat was o nce one of the Pleiades, a star cluster in the constellatio n Taurus the Bull. It is crucial to note that the ancients used a dove as a symbol for Tiamat. The Babylonias called the Pleiad es the Flock of Doves. 12 The Greeks called them the Atlantides . At the annual Babylonian re-enactment of the splittin g of Tiamat (and its Atlantis-like sinking into the wate rs of the night), a dove was split in half, in imitation of An’s splitting of Tiamat. When the dove was joined to her beloved consort the phallic serpent, the Dove-goddess, Tiamat, stood for “Life.” 1 3 In Sumerian myth An split Tiamat into two parts, “upper waters” and “lower waters.” The Hebrew scrib es recorded that their god “divided the waters that we re under the firmament from the waters that were above the firmament.” 14 Also in the book of Genesis there arose a Great Dragon or Sea Monster called Tehom . In the plural, Tehom becomes Tehomot (Tiamat), which God, in his f iery chariot, rode the waves and attacked, flinging at her g reat volleys of hail, lightning and thunderbolts. Barbar a Walker states that Tehom is the same as Kali. 15 In Psalm 89:10-11 the seat of Babylon is called Rahab : “Thou hast broken Rahab to pieces , as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. Th e Heavens are thine, the Earth also is thine...” “By his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces. By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.” 16"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 0 8 As a reult of this confrontation, 17 Tiamat was split in two. One half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt, t he other half became Earth. “Earth is the daughter of Tiamat . The Chaldeans called Tiamat Mer , and believed that it was from her that the original matter that formed t he Earth was created. Various myths say that Tiamat produced the fluid of creation, which was blood. By splitting or dividing the (s)tone of Tiamat in two An released an Ocean of Bloo d into the cosmos. This is verified in the Greek version of Tiamat’s name -- Diameter or Demeter -- the cutting of a circle in two , or Dia (split) mater (mother/matter). It is ultimately important to realize that this horri fic image of the dragon cut to pieces is archetypal. The As above. So below law applies. The great red dragon is frequently used to refer to blood (and I propose DNA). Tiamat was split in half by Nibiru, exactly the way Michael “slayed the dragon,” a nd the way Jesus is prophesied to “slay the dragon” in the book of Revelation. One rather bizarre statement that suggests that Tiamat was inhabited, and that her blood represents an actu al blood line, appears in the book of Jeremiah: “ I beheld the Earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled .

However, according to Jeremiah, there were no men around to build these citi es. So, this is a real whodunnit here. What cities are these? Who built them? Who are the birds of heaven that fl ed? Jeremiah can only be describing a time in ancient history shortly after the destruction of Tiamat. The Earth truly was without form, it was still a chunk of debri s from the explosion, and had yet to be ground into a sphere by gravitational forces. Darkness was upon the face of the Deep, Tiamat, a clear reflection of the immense traged y of the cataclysm. Worst of all, the “spirit of God mov ed upon the face of the waters.” 19 That is, the souls of Tiamat were roaming the cosmi c ocean. They needed to be rescued. According to Sume rian myth, the ‘ark’ that rescued these souls was the Mo on. My premise is that the symbols of the ancients, including the ME stones, the Tower of Babel and the eagle/heron clutching the Key of Life or olive branch of peace represent powerful healing technology. Following these symbols les us to ancient medical facilities, including the prehistoric mound of A-tum a t Heliopolis, which housed the heron/eagle/messiah’s secrets of transmuting matter and the blood.

Are the nuclear secrets of the atomic bomb somehow related to the secrets at the nucleus of a red bloo d cell? A startling correspondence between the Grail and th e early controlled nuclear chain reaction experiments centers around the substance used as a “moderator” for slowing the emitted neutrons from each fission to thermal speed so that the capture and fission of adjacent nuclei would be facilitated. Water was considered, as well as “heavy” water, a cocktail of oxygen and deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. The alchemists called quicksilver (mercury ) “heavy water.” 20 After considerable debate between scientists Leo Szilard and Enrico Fermi, Szilard finally concluded that pure graphite would be the best substance for the controlled nuclear reaction. Graphite is one of the forms of carbon and is also known as black lead . Since ancient times a black stone cube was the symbol for Tiamat. When the first nuclear reactor was finished in September 1941 it was an extremely pure carbon graphite column or pillar 3 by 3 by 8 feet. By placing a neutron source at the base of the black stone pillar, and measu ring gear at key positions, the Columbia scientists were able to study the behavior of the neutrons as they sped thr ough the carbon.

Later he helped Moses in parting the waters of the Re d Sea. When God’s son Jesus (the second Adam or A-tom) was on the Cross he spurted transformed blood and waters. Why this emphasis on blood and water? The key to deciphering water’s inner meaning is provided when we remember that water is often used as a metaphor for Nu : “mother,” “matter” and “wisdom.” Nu, of course, is the root for nuclear . As the ancient alchemists knew, water is the first of al l elements and the mythological metaphor for wisdom and souls. It was from the water or matter of the “Goddess Mother Tiamat” from whose body/clay that the Earth was born. Mythologically speaking, splitting the myths of Tiamat’s waters and getting to the core of her myster y will help illuminate the mysteries of blood. This very special fluid is known as the seawaters of creation. Tiamat’s oceans were described as a womb full of the fluid of creation. The ancients, particularly t he Hermetic magicians, claimed that souls were created by the mat ernal waters in combination with the maternal Earth (“cla y”), which is 70% salt . What is salt? Salt is sodium chloride, NaCl , a white, crystalline substance. When we open our salt shaker and take a look at the grains of salt, we see that they are tiny cubes. The word salt is found throughout the Indo- European languages as zout, salz, soly, sa. It is obviously phonetically linked with soul . Saltation is a medical term for a sudden genetic mutation.

Technically, human blood is a thickish, opaque fluid, bright red or scarlet when it flows from the arteries and dark red or purple when it fl ows from the veins. Technically, blood is a transport liquid p umped by the heart. Blood binds or ties the internal environment of the body to the world outside. A key to understanding b lood is the fact that it evolved from seawater , which in primitive organisms was the source of elements essential for growth. Through blood flows the same mineral balance as that of the seas of the Cambrian era, 500 million years ago. Thus the basic chemical constituency of plasma resembles th at of primordial seawater, consisting of water and dissolved salts. Human blood is seawater. The tissue (the human body) produced by blood is also seawater. This is the atm osphere in which body cells live and breath. About 60 percent of the weight of the human body is water. Roughly 40 p ercent of this is the fluid within the cells themselves. THE MIRACLE OF CANA “Blood,” says Eliphas Levi, “is the first incarnation of the universal fluid; it is the materialized vital lig ht” (of the Light of Tula). Blood is in reality the latest fact or to originate in a human. This is clearly revealed by the mysteries of embryology. “If we follow the development of the human embryo,” writes Rudolph Steiner, “we find that the rudiments of bone and muscle are evolved long before the first te ndency towards blood formation becomes apparent. The groundwork for the formation of the blood with all its attendant system of blood vessels, appears very lat e in the development of the embryo, and from this natural science has rightly concluded that the formation of blood occurred late in the evolution of the universe ..."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 1 5 Not until the human embryo has repeated in itself all the earlier stages of human growth, thus attaining to the condition in which the world was before the formati on of blood, is it ready to perform the crowning act of e volution - - the transmuting and uplifting of all that had gone b efore into the ‘very special fluid’ which we call blood.” 21 The action of oxygen on these seawaters gives them a red coloration. Therefore, the Red Sea of Hebrew myth is our blood. The Great Fish in this Sea, the jewel in the crown of evolution, according to Christian tradition, is Christ, the god part within each of us. 22 Dr. George Carey has shown that the original meanin g of the word Galilee was a “circle of water, or fluid -- the circulatory system.” 23 This is the same as the definition of the word Diam eter, another name for Tiamat. Once again, the stars and planets find expression in the human body. In Sumerian myth An split Tiamat into two parts, “upper waters” and “lower waters.” The Hebrew scribes recorded that their god “divided the waters that were under the firmament from the wat ers that were above the firmament.” 24 The Mayan and Egyptian hieroglyph for water was a wavy line or zig zag symbolizing the waters of the sea. Le Plongeon states that among the Mayas the wavy- line hieroglyph was water terminated with the head of a snake. To early humans the line on the ground symbolized the serpentine cosmic force transformed from a heav enly ‘S’ to the earthly ‘s’ (s is Schin or sin in Hebrew )."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 1 6 Prehistoric rock carving from Bohuslan, Sweden.

Cana signifies “a dividing place,” in the Bible. To the biochemist, then, the first miracle of Jesus according to John, that of changing water into wine at the marri age feast of (C)ana in Galilee, is a literally anatomical process ta king place with every heart beat in the human body. Galilee means a “circle.” 26 In the human body it means a circle of water or blood – the circulatory system. This miracle takes place in the embryo when the soul parts or splits the waters of the sea of blood and begi ns to create the warm-blooded human being.

The consciousness of humanity, high or low, is released through the blood. With the addition of human blood, consciousness moves from heredity (evolution) to environment -- from inward to outward perception. The ultimate act of consciousness is called Canonization in the Christian tradition. This is when one becomes a saint, effectively dividing or setting oneself apart from t he rest of humanity. In Acts 2:4 the Ap-ostles were recognized as canonize d when a “flame of invisible light,” a lamp, appeared on top of their heads (as it did on the Buddhist bodhisatt vas). This flame streaming from their heads signified super- intelligence. According to Webster’s , the word can- dor, honesty in expressing oneself, comes from candere , to shine. 27 This is also the root of candle . THE OCEAN OF LIFE The notion that the miracle of Cana occurs within each of us throws a flood of light on the inner mysteries of our body. It points us in the direction of the waters of Ea rth as the mother substance and a source of healing. In order to understand our mystic anatomy we must understand th e nature of the essential element of which we are compo sed: water. Let us examine, for a moment, this wonderful substance. The ocean, say biologists, is the original home of the human body. As such, we have a little bit of the ocean within each of us. This is an astonishing fact.

The body fluids of living creatures, including ours elves, also contains salt. The salt content of seawater expr essed as a percentage (the number of parts by weight of salt in one hundred parts of water) is about 3.4 percent, whil e our blood is about 0.8 percent. A cubic mile of seawater contains 166 million tons of salt. The sea as a whole contains enough salt to cover the continents with a layer 500 feet thick. Scientists believe 6 percent salinity is t he maximum percentage tolerable by living organisms. E ven if the average salinity was only 4 percent, say scientists, life in the sea would have taken a completely different form. Scientists have long pondered the salt connection. Why is the sea salt? Why also is salt so intelligently regul ated by nature? There is comparatively reliable evidence that the s alinity of seawater has changed very little in hundreds of millions of years. One of the great unsolved mysteries of chem ical oceanography is the way in which salt is removed from the ocean. Oceanographers have long since proposed the need for a device that removes the salt from the sea as fas t as it is added. How can this be? Technically, the ocean is a vast machine that trans forms the radiant energy of the sun into the motions of air an d water that in turn distribute this energy over all the regions of the world.

The Earth is in cosmic relationship with the other planets in our solar system, the stars in the nearby constellations and throughout our galaxy. Our galax y, in turn, is in symbiotic balance with each and every o ne of the other galaxies that comprise our local neighborhood in the garden of Creation. Our lives are governed and modulated by the spiritual emanations or “waters” of these galaxies. They are the ‘stuff’ out of which our bodies are made.

We are all part of the same song. We are just arranged dif ferently. “Supernovas are more than distant spectacles: they make and expel the seeds of life.” 4 This statement prefaced Scientific American’s coverage of the 1987 supernova. The ancient alchemists could not have pu t it any better. They described these seeds of light when th ey wrote of the “ scintillae ,” the infinitesimal sparks of light contained in the “arcane substance,” the primordial matter. Periods during which the “sparks of light” are available are “highlighted” by supernovas. For example, the previous Mayan baktun (calendar period of 144,000 days or 394 years) stretching from 1224-1618 AD has been called the “Baktun of the Hidden Seed,” the “h idden seed” being interpreted as an expansive civilizatio n cycle. 5 The beginning and ending of the baktun were literally “highlighted” by supernovas: one in 1230 AD and Kepler’s supernova in 1604 AD -- the last one visible to the naked eye. Both supernovas appeared in the constellation Ophiuchus (the Serpent Holder), which means their energies came through the ‘lens’ of Ophiuchus."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"GOD MAKING 1 2 3 Rosicrucian drawing from 1618.

Usually they are known as great physicians of the soul. For example, Asclepius is equated with the Mayan god Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent (a bird-serpent -man) who was also known as the King of Tula and the bringer of Peace. The Mayans called Tula ‘the place of hero ns’. Another key figure related to Ophiuchus is Apollo. Ophiuchus is the son of Apollo, the Greek Sun of God who turned himself into a bird. In ancient times Apollo was considered “God’s Son,” through which the Father is revealed. Father God was a spirit beyond space and time. Beneath this unmanife sted One is God’s Son. The Son is the laws of the cosmos and the natural order. According to the Greeks, Apollo came from Hyperboria, the Greek name for Heaven. At the center of Hyperboria was a mecca for learning called Tula. There, Apollo became skilled at resurrecting the dead thro ugh the blood from the side of the goddess of justice . Consequently, Apollo was worshipped as a savior. The Greeks said that from the center of heaven, Tula, Apollo would strum his seven-stringed lyre, his golden harp (which undoubtedly was tuned to the Key of Life), and seven rays of light (keys, tones) would alight from Tula. Who, exactly, is the ‘goddess of justice’ whose blood , tones and letters were so valuable? As mentioned, Tula is a Sanskrit word for ‘balance’ which embodies the concept of justice. ‘Maat’ or ‘T iamat’ means ‘truth’.

For centuries institutio ns have promoted a repressive division of body and mind, male and female. In our culture the brain is domina nt. However, ‘new’ science is discovering the heart also has its own intelligence. The heart’s intelligence is linked to a mysterious subtle energy, say scientists, the Soul. The heart, some believe, is the seat of a soul. It loves, feels, thinks, remembers, and sends out energy and information from soul to soul. If accepted, listened to, and nurtured the hidden soul can re-animate and re-energize our relationships with an infusion of energy and lo ve. This is one obvious reason why mystic teachers are united in their belief in the power of love, including Jesus. In early Christian and literature Jesus is frequently referred to in association not just with love, but like the other Soul healers I have mentioned, he is associated with the bird and the serpent. In a conversation with Nicodemus the Pharisee he likened himself to the serpent of bronze lifted up by Moses. 16 Simultaneously, he inferred a relationship to the serpent of the Garden of Eden, the messenger of wisdom of eternal life. In The Gospel of Thomas Jesus says: And Jesus said to them: When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside, and t he outside like the inside, and the above like the bel ow, and when you make the male and the female one and t he same... then you enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

The fact that a dove represents the Holy Spirit in Christia n tradition brings up an astonishing connection betwee n the Sumerian, Egyptian and Christian traditions. This belief was profusely demonstrated in early Christian characterizations of Jesus found in the c atacombs of Rome. Jesus is clearly shown with wand in hand performing miracles, including turning water into win e and raising Lazarus from the dead. Showing Jesus with the wand of Moses in hand is meant to connect the two figures. This wand connects Jesus and Moses with ‘Egypt’, the land from whence their teachings emerg ed. The Hindus were among the first to place the twisti ng serpents of the caduceus and Staff of Life within t he body. They identified seven chakras or energy centers of the human body. The energy flow within follows the ‘spi ral or corkscrew effect’ found governing organic growth. One of these currents is masculine the other is feminine.

It is symbolic of the ideal human body in which the forces of renewal move freely throughout the entire body and connect with the higher healing ene rgies. As we have seen, the two staffs carried by Thoth, the Egyptian god of magic and letters were originally found in Sumeria as the symbol for Ningishzidda (“Lord of the Artifact or Key of Life”), the son of the creator god E.A . whose emblem was also the entwined serpents. Not until French excavators discovered the Sumero- Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh did mythologists begin t o understand why the snake represented healing. Gilagamesh was a legendary ruler of Uruk who undertook a desperate search for the secret of immortali ty in order to save his friend Enkidu from death at th e hands of the gods.

Hence, the Gordian chains of association appear to be telling us that Ptah was the founder of the Smiths or Schmidts, a role he shared with E.A. The name Schmidt can be traced to the Sumerian word SHI.IM.TI. According to Sitchin, taken syllable by syllable, this word means “breath-wind-life,” 24 and was used to describe a medical facility. In Egyptian tradition, the “breath of life” was channeled through the Key of Life as in the depiction of Isis suckling Horus above. The word SHI.IM.TI became napishtu in Akkadian and nephesh in Hebrew. All three terms refer to “something” in the blood, says Sitchin.

THE SHEEPFOLD: THE VESSEL OF CREATION Among Mari’s many titles she was known as Ma-Ya , ‘the Lady of Life’, or Ma . 32 Her temple/womb/sheepfold was considered the vessel of Creation. With her Shugurra helmet snuggly fitting her head, Mari goes to her sheepfold, which is the center of nature of Sumer. Leani ng against a fruit tree, she rejoices in her own natur al powers - - her wondrous vulva. According to Sumerian myth, Mari/Inanna rescued the Tree of Life from the world flood and planted it in he r garden at Mari. This Tree was a Teli or an axis conne cting the underworld with Earth and the heavens. 33 Mari seeks to use the wood from the Tree to make a throne and a bed. However, she discovers that the T ree has some unexpected occupants. A serpent has “made his nest in the tree.” This serpent is not alone. The “anzu bird who set his young on the branches,” also dwells within, as does the “dark-maid Lilith” who built her home in the tr unk. 34 The inhabitants of the Tree -- two snakes named Lilith and Samuel -- refuse to leave. “In Hermetic myth,” writes Titus Burckhardt, 35 Hermes (Thoth) struck with his rod a pair of serpents in combat with one another. The rod tamed the serpents, which wound themselves round the rod and conferred on Hermes the theurgic power of ‘binding’ ( fusion ) and ‘loosing’ ( fission ).

The Greeks called Thoth by name Hermes (‘stone’). Thoth’s ‘day job’ was scribe. Scri bes acted as bridges between worlds, filters of secret or protected wisdom. They then preserved and dissemina ted this knowledge, becoming librarians of sacred wisdom. Thoth was described by the Egyptians as the patron of learning, magic, truth, books and libraries, keeper of the Akashic records, and Time Lord. Because of his wisdom the Egyptians said Thoth was a ‘god’. This is an exaggeration. His Hebrew name Enosh or Enoch ; a Hebrew term meaning ‘human, mortal’, proves this. Additional confirmation comes from the Sumerians who preserve the record of Thoth’s conception and lineage. In the Greek tradition, Thoth (whom the Hebrews called Enoch) was transformed into the guardian of roa ds, pathways and gates, including those of consciousness. Sacred to him, and presumably ‘the perptetual priestho od’ of the Peacemakers, was THE PATH or THE WAY.

The meaning of sur-pent is the same as current , in electricity the flow or rate of flow of electric force in a conductor, from a point of high potential to one of low er potential. Using this tree as an example, Osiris taught humanity the art of cultivation . The word cultivate comes from the root cul and means “to prepare and use (soil, land, etc.) for growing crops; to till . 44 Obviously, till is TLI or a Tula word. This may explain why the Hebrew mystics called the Pillar to Heaven th e Teli . It is a feminine or fer tility symbol. Teli is one of the most mysterious words in Hebrew mysticism. According to many interpreters of the Ka ballah, the Teli is the imaginary axis around which the heave ns rotate. 45 It is seen as an imaginary line from which the celestial sphere hangs ( talah ). According to this, the word Teli comes from the root Talah and means “to hang.” Other authorities identify the Teli with the “Pole Serpent” mentioned in the book of Job, 46 “By His spirit, the heavens were calmed, His hand has pierced the Po le Serpent.” This Pole Serpent is imagined as an imaginary creatu re from which the Earth hangs. From another perspective, where serpent and soul are interchangeable, the Teli may refer to a Pillar from which hangs a serpent-shaped soul sphere.

Another relevant interpretation of Teli comes from the Kaballists. They claim that Teli is actually a plac e under the firmament of Vilon, 48 and that it is inhabited by pure, angelic humanoid beings. The mysteries of creation ar e revealed to these beings. They, in turn, reveal the se divine secrets to humans. A communications system with the se beings is given. In the eleventh century Rabbi Judah HaLevi wrote that the Teli definitely refers to the spiritual world (a la Tula) and to hidden mysteries which cannot be grasped. Th e Teli is the “node” or “knot” where the spiritual and mortal worlds meet. 49 The Talmud confirms this speculation saying, “the stormwind hangs ( talah ) between the two arms of god like an amulet.” 50 As we discussed earlier, the O symbolized Tula with specks in it. In Egyptian tradition the O hung from the Key of Life, a branch of the Tree of Life or Teli Pillar. The Pillar of Osiris stood approximately forty feet tall and was lined with gold. It contained the “head,” “(s)tone” or “key” of Osiris. Powerful linkage between the Egyptian Pillar of Osiri s and Hebrew knowledge of the Teli comes from the Bah ir. The Bahir states: “What is the Teli? It is the likeness before the Blessed Holy One. It is thus written, ‘Hi s locks are hanging ( taltalim ). 51 The verse continues, “His head is a treasure of fine gold , His locks are hanging, black like a raven.” In the Torah God’s wisdom emanates from His head .

According to Rosicrucian records, from their comman d post on Mount Carmel, Elijah’s priesthood sent and received communications from other top-secret installations constructed by the tribe around the worl d. This included some valuable records once possessed b y Moses in c. 1,400 BC which were transferred from On (also called Heliopolis) in Egypt to Mount Carmel c . 850 BC just in time for the arrival of Elijah.

However, there is another important reason. The Bible says John the Baptist and Elijah were both clothed in camel hair . The point of ‘camel’ in this context, I believe, is th at it is phonetically close to ‘carmel’, and that the Heb rew name for the camel is kir-karah . 58 The Greek word for the caduceus -- kery-keion -- shares the same root.

So, it is impossible to say for certain that the man depicted in the Shroud is or is not Jesus. Osiris and Lazarus were both depicted wrapped in a linen cloth. This ‘skin’ is, quite possibly, a modifi ed form of the corium , the innermost layer of the skin in mammals, lying beneath the epidermis and containing the bloo d and nerve supply. It is the true skin. The inner radiance, the many-colored coat, attributed to healers and saints emanates from this layer of skin. Ancient Roman soldiers wore a corium, a kind of body armor composed of scales or small plates of leather. In ancient China martial arts masters practiced breathi ng exercises called “Iron Shirt Chi Kung” designed to prepare the body for higher spiritual energies. These masters achieved an “iron shirt” or “steel body.” They could energize the body such that they could resist sharp knives with their bare skin. 63 Was the Roman corium an imitation of the transformed blood platelets of the C hinese masters? In addition to the Mesneu priests of Isis and Osiris the Bardesanes, a group of 2nd century AD Gnostics, also appear to have held this science. The Bardesanes (‘b ird Essenes’?) were the followers of a priest of the sa me name who taught that the purpose of Earth life was to transform our human bodies into ethereal or spiritual materia l. Bardesane came from Edessa in Mesopotamia. Coincidentally, this was the city where the Shroud of Turin was hidden after the Crucifixion.

I have concluded that the ancients are telling us that the means to alter the order of or cure the blood is to li nk with the healing energies from Tula. Once inside the blood stream these energies cause a new light, energy or “hair” to appear on the exterior of our skin. Additional linguistic evidence of the healing ability of these Tula energies is found in the word curse , another core or cure word, which means to call down wrath upon or to utter an evil wish upon. In Revelation 14:19-20 an angel appears and thrusts his sickle into the Earth, and casts it into the winepress of the wrath of God . The winepress suddenly opens up: “And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles. A winepress obviously crushes grapes.

Together they represent fire and wa ter, whose combination produced the Blood of Life. In addition to hinting at chemical and nuclear transmutation the deepest and most hidden meaning of the early alchemical and Grail writings were theologica l, philosophical and psychological. These writings rev eal an obsession with the mystical transformation of an aver age person from “lead” into a spiritual being, “gold,” f rom a body of flesh into a body of light. The Blood of Li fe of the core enabled this transformation. This body of light is the “camel hair” coat of the Elijah and John. Its secrets are embedded in the linen Shroud of Turin. THE CORN-EA Opening the word ker and discovering the kery-keon staff of life revealed the secrets of the camel hair. The root meaning of ker or core also brings illumination to the healing power of the hair of Isis. In the mysteries, the blood tie was used as a method of transmitting the knowledge of the core.

Without realizing it, Jacob had come to “none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of Heaven.” 7 At the very top of the ladder stood the Lord who directly affirmed the promise made to Jacob’s grandf ather Abraham and his father Isaac: his descendents would spread all over the Earth and that the Lord would n ot leave Jacob until his mission was accomplished. In return, like Abraham before him, Jacob would give this God one-tenth of his earnings, or a tithe, if he was able to return safely to Canaan. Jacob awoke, awestruck, and the following morning h e annointed his (s)tone pillow with oil, establishing it for God’s use, and named the place Beth-El, “house of G od.” The holy (s)tone upon which Jacob rested naturally draws our attention.

Is it possible that Jacob had received some advanced psychic training that allowed him to communicate wi th the Lord through these special stones? We already know that the Key of Life from ancient times acted as transmitters. Could it have been the Emerald Tablet of Destiny, that Jacob discovered hidden at Beth-El? Was this the (s)tone that altered Jacob’s brainwave s? Originally, the Bible tells us, Beth-El had a diffe rent name. The “name of the city was called Luz.” 8 This is curious in that the word luz means light. Had people seen lights here before? Is that why it was marked with special stones? This place called Luz is extraordinary. Later, it was a t this exact vortex that Joshua divided the waters to cross into the “Promised Land.” Earlier I noted that one part of the retina of the eye is called Jacob’s Layer.

According to Pata njali (whose name rings of Ptah), an Indian yogi who lived c. 200 BC - AD 100, to pierce the covering of light and cross these waters brings one in contact with maha-videha , literally “Great Knowledge.” The word V-ideha (V-Idea) is derived from the same Indo-European root as Greek idein and Latin videre , “t o see.” Patanjali’s description matches the Idea sphere discussed earlier, providing another corroborating tradition for the theory that the blue apples of Tula enhance the blood’s ability to access, download and store knowl edge or wisdom (‘water’) from the Thought Sphere. Like the Idea sphere, Maha-videha is beyond buddhi , “intellect,” says Patanjali. Buddhi is also the San skrit word for the planet Mercury. The Romans changed Hermes/Thoth’s name to Mercury, who escorted or “shuttled” souls to the higher realms. A shuttle and a Net symbolized the Egyptian goddess Neith . The Greek word for the rod used to drive home the threads of the shuttle’s warp and woof and make the m firm is kerkis , from which comes ker-kyon , Hermes’ wand.

RETURN TO MOUNT CARMEL As I stated, since the Renaissance the achievement of higher consciousness has been the Holy Grail of science and medicine. The means to achieve the Grail are the true subjects of myth, and medicine. Realizing that the Staff of Life and the Key of Life point to internal processes – the curing of the blood and the possible attachment of something to the cornea -- is i t possible that Mount Carmel, the sacred biblical place, was named after a place within the body? The hair and cornea links the anatomical Carmel to the head area as suggested by Solomon. Would that not suggest the possibility that the two cones supported by the Key of Life are the two hemispheres (‘Carmel mounta ins’) of the brain? While this is plausible it is necessary to consider another vital organ with two sides: the heart. Carm el comes from Car , the root for cardiac, or heart, and me(l) , meaning wisdom of El.

He saw humans as embodying three distinct entities, plus a mysterious fourth: • soma (body) • psyche (soul) • thumos (will) • eidolon (dream image). In Greek myth, Tartarus is the Inner Earth place where souls live in between incarnation. They live a very different form of existence, one devoid of blood , voices and vital energy . They await rebirth so that they might incarnate in human form to acquire these ‘tools of the soul’. Ho mer’s worldview may state the soul’s purpose on Earth: • to gain a particular blood, • to acquire a voice to utter the word of power (the Key of Life), • and to wield the life force energy. Put in terms of the Grail myths, Greek thought proposes the soul’s purpose on Earth is to acquire: • the Holy Blood • the Holy Grail, and • the Holy Light In Illiad when Hermes has left the sea of “violet blue” he enters the cave of Calypso, whom Homer referred to as “she of the braided tresses.” This begins the soul’s journey into the human body. Homer gives the epithet “She of the Braided Tresses ” to one other figure in the Odyssey : Circe.

Anot her thread linking Calypso with Tula is Homer’s descriptio n of Calypso’s cave: a cave with four springs. The ga lactic Tula is symbolized by the Enclosed Sun Cross representing the four springs or rivers of souls. The Greek meaning of Calypso -- Veiler or Concealer -- suggests a n association with Tula, ‘hidden’. Every day found Ulysses sitting on the shore “his eyes as ever dewed with tears at this ebbing of his p recious life.” At the intercession of Hermes, the soul conductor, Calypso agreed to let Ulysses go and provided a sail ing- ship for him. In goddess mythology sacred caves were called the “Caves of Love.” They were places where couples in l ove would come to ‘make love’. Ulysses’ stay at the cav e of Calypso is significant. The cave of love was said to contain “hidden treasures,” 14 a term which meant the paraphernalia of the Old Religion which typically included: • the Cup of Destiny, • the Stone of Destiny • the Sword of Destiny • the Staff or Rod of Destiny These tools were considered to be physical objects , “power tools,” that are employed by a spiritual craft sman to accomplish his or her work. This cave was situat ed near a magic pool of regeneration (presumably containing t he healing waters of Tula) and featured singing birds, a pples, and roses.

According to the legend, Theseus volunteered to go to the island of Crete to kill the Min-otaur, a monster who was half man, half bull (cow) who resided deep underground in a Labyrinth.

Earth life is completed once w e tame the “beast” within and transform ourselves into angels. The Key of Life is required to effect this transformation. THE RAFT OF GRAPES The vehicle in which all humans affect this transformation is the human body. “Lifting the rod” (the chromosomes) enables the soul to craft a vehicle, a human body that will take it “over” the wine-dark sea of blood.

The contemporary Chronicle of St. Denis states: “In these girdles was their mahommerie .” The identity of the mahommerie is a mystery. This word is composed of the elements Ma and Homer. Its last element -- merie -- means sea. Was the Templar term mahommerie a word play for Mother’s or Homer’s Sea? What is Homer’s Mother’s Sea? It is the wine-dark sea, the blood. This word play suggests that the Mahommerie represented both the blood and the secret of weaving or knitting this blood. This speculation is made possible by the fact that both the Cathars and the Templar claim ed to have possessed the secrets of the blood of Christ. The Freemasons were the spiritual descendents of the Templars. Gerald Massey has suggested that the word Mason comes from the Egyptian Sen =son, for blood and brotherhood... Ma-sen = Mason, would denote the true brotherhood, and as Sen is also blood, the true brotherhood as the blood-brotherhood would be the Masons in the occult sense. Members of the Masonic fraternity are sometimes referred to as “Brothers of the Mystic Ti e.” Proof of the perpetuation of this symbolism in found in the masonic apron worn by George Washington.

These winged guardians often appear in religious contexts, especially around the Tree of Life, the link between heaven and earth. In Genesis, cherubim were placed by Yahweh east of the Garden of Eden (Tula) ‘ to keep the way of the Tree of Life ’ 19 -- meaning as intermediaries between the human and divine realm. In other words, the cherubim guard the mysteries that lead us to the ‘magic tree’ or ‘teli’ that connects us to Tula. These cherubim are beside the Flaming Sword which is, of course, the (S)word of Destiny. In fact, the Ark held the two tablets containing the Word of God. 20 Therefore, it appears the Ark of the Covenant works in conjunction with the (S)word of Destiny or is set-up in the same locale.

As they wandered, Yahweh led them by day, visibly appearing as a huge “cloud,” and by night as a “cloud of fire.” 25 Wherever the cloud went the Israelites followed. Every now and then, the Shekinah (“spirit of glory”) of Yahweh would beam from the Ark (like something stra ight out of Aladdin ), filling the tribes of Israel with awe and wonder. After forty years of wandering in the wilderness, f inally deployed the Ark. On this mission, the Israelites c arried the Ark to the Jordan River. Joshua, the only person per mitted to go with Moses “up into the mountain of God” to receive the Ten Commandments led this mission. 26 Later, whenever Moses left his tent to go off and talk with God it was Joshua who guarded the entrance to t he tent. The selection of Joshua as commander of the Israelites is noteworthy. Joshua is the Greek for ‘Jesus’. He is referred to explicitly as the son of Nun, Sumerian for ‘fish’. Wh en Joshua takes over leadership from Moses later in th e story, it is said to be a foreshadowing of the coming of Jesus, who was also symbolized by the fish.

The Ar k reappeared at the time of Moses and Joshua ( c . 1,400 BC). It seem equally obvious that Joshua placed the grap es stolen from the gods in the Ark as well. Later, the grapes of the Promised Land appeared at the Last Supper. In summary, the Ark is the container for the secrets of creation. A cluster of grapes symbolizes these secr ets.

And there in roosted birds long of wing, o wls, and falcons and chattering sea crows, which have their business in the waters.” In the Old Testament, the smell of cedar is most cl osely associated with the Holy of Holies of Solomon’s Tem ple. When Solomon built his temple he created an altar out of cedar. On this altar rested the Ark of the Covenant, w hich held the two (s)tone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were etched. One of mythology’s most intriguing stories is found in the description of Solomon’s Temple. King Solomon b uilt this temple after the Lord had “given him wisdom.” Th is wisdom, we have learned, was the Language of the Birds or angels, the original language spoken by Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. It gave Solomon ‘abundance of all things’ and enabled him to fly like an angel. Inside Solomon’s Temple was the Holy of Holies, a room in the shape of a perfect cube devoted to the Goddess Anath . Only the High Priest could enter this cube -- and then only on one day of the year. In the Book of Kings, we learn that outside the Holy of Holies of Solomon’s Temple are two pillars (like a circus) and a Sea of Brass. 4 The two pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, were a remarkable 40 feet high (about as tall as a five story building). When united, say myths, they upheld a great archway to eternity. In the middle of the arc hway was peace.

These two pillars are often interchanged (some say confused) with the two pillars that play a signific ant role in Masonic legend. 5 The Masonic pillars are the medium by which the secret pre-Flood knowledge was saved from destruction by Fire and Water. In Babylonian legend a priest was forewarned of the coming cataclysm. He wrote all the sacred knowledge of the ancient world on clay tablets that were then charred in a fiery furnace. These tablets were buried at the City of the Sun at Sippara, and were the basis for knowledge upon which the building of the Tower of Babel was made possible. In Hebrew legend, these “tablets” became “pillars.” Astronomical discoveries and music were inscribed on the pillars. In medieval times it was claimed that Pythagoras and Hermes each discovered these pillars and passed on their secret knowledge. The burnt clay that composes these pillars or tablets is an obvious allusion to DNA. What better medium to store knowledge than in these ubiquitous particles of creat ion? What better way to symbolize DNA than by two spiraling pillars representing the physical powers of generatio n or creation?

Numerous scholars have observed that the Holy of Holies of ancient temples, including the Temple of Solomon, were living memorials to the Great Mother, in this case the Goddess Inanna, and that these temples w ere designed and constructed as models of Her female bod y and physiologic processes. 6 The entrance to these temples and the Holy of Holie s were replicas of the birth canal and womb.

In Aramaic, it is nehash , which is similar to nahash , the Hebrew word for serpent. The Hebrew word for soul is neshamah .

Hermes descended to the cave of Calypso by coming down a ladder crossing the River Styx. Relating this story to human anatomy, the spinal cord is the ladder Herme s descended. The island Calypso is the solar plexus. As noted, in Illiad Homer referred to Calypso as “she of the braided tresses.” This epithet “She of the Braided Tresses” was shared by Circe. Sometimes called Clotho “the Spinner,” she was one of the Greek Moerae or Fates; She Who Spins the Thr ead of Life.

This linking or knitting process is inferred in the origins of the word shuttle, the mechanism through w hich Circe knits them together. Derived from the Anglo-Saxo n sceatel, scytel, a shuttle, from sceotan, to shoot: so called because shot to and from with the thread in weaving; Icelandic skutul; Danish skyttel, shuttle .

As we have seen aescuele or skill was the French word for the wise blood of Jesus, who performed the miracle of Cana. The word canny means skilled. 10 This process of shooting up the tube, chimney or rod of life is con firmed in the origins of the word cannon: from the Latin Canna and the Greek kanon, from kane, a reed or rod . The Red Sea (of blood) is also called the Sea of Reeds. Shuttle, as we can see, comes from the same root as skil, wisdom.

It was said the Pythagorean philosopher Thales, one of the Seven Wise Men of the ancient world, received his intellectual skills from communion with the Goddess of Wisdom in an Abaton. This is an important link to our thesis that the li ght of Tula ignites access to the thought sphere or wisdom. The Bible calls this pit Abaddon, the home of Apollo, the serpent-deity. 11 In Judeo-Christian terminology Abaddon is a synonym for Hell, a place to be avoide d at all costs. Originally, however, Hel was the goddess’ fiery furnace or womb of transformation; a place where men were transformed into gods. 12 Significantly, the meaning of the Egyptian word ab, heart-soul, was also reversed in Hebrew; ab was redefined as “father.” The feminine teachings relative to the heart-soul were suppressed. They were not, however, completely erased. After his initiation in the Pit Joseph was given the name Scalit . 13 Scalit means ‘wise man’ and comes from slt , assistant to the High Priest. 14 Fascinatingly, Scala means a ladder or flight of steps. 15 Lit means light or to illuminate. Scala Dei , meaning “Ladder to God,” was another name for the Cross upon which Jesus was crucified.

The word solar comes from sol “the sun.” In alchemy it is gold. Phonetically, it refers to “the soul.” Plexus means ‘to twine, braid’. The solar plexus acts as a ‘shuttle’ or weaver for the soul’s energies of the Central Sun, Tula. It ‘shuttles’ or transports the soul and the blood along the Tree of Life. How does it do this? One noteworthy solution comes from the definition of solve , a Latin musical term meaning tone . The Greek word for the rod used to drive home the threads of the shut tle’s (Hindu charka’s ) warp and woof and make them firm is kerkis , from which comes kerkyon or kerkeon , Hermes’ wand. In the hand of the Egyptian Thoth this rod was called the Key of Life, and was used to unite or ‘tie’ the brain to the higher vibrational energies, the Light , of Tula. It is important to remember that Circe and Calypso’s function also exactly mirrors the braided tresses b ehind the eyes. Homer appears to be describing the manner in which several crania nerves, including the optic, trigemi nal, and abducent to mention three, are entwined with each ot her behind the eyes. This loom creates a covering of light, a veiler or concealer. When this rod applies the “covering of Li ght” to the eyes it lifts the cloud or cover of darkness and opens the door to higher consciousness. From this we may theorize that the light of Tula work s on two levels: the rods of the eyes and the altar of the solar plexus.

Much like a needle drills through cloth, this spinning Pillar drilled a hole in the fabric of space-time. Its internal counterpart, the sola r plexus, weaves together the elements or letters of creati on (A,C,T,G). Physiologically, the cannon of the Pillar is the spinal cord to which the cranial nerves of perception are connected, roughly from the medulla to the thalamus. It is symbolic of the ideal human body in which the forces of renewal move freely throughout the entire body. The spine is a flexible column consisting of 33 segments or vertebrae. This ladder of bones played a key role in the religious symbolism of the ancients, where it is referred to as a winding road or stairway . Other times it is a serpent, wand or a scepter. The Hindus called it the “Meru-Danda” (spinal column). The number 33 is highly significant, for David reigned for 33 years atop Mount Moriah (from Meru) i n Jerusalem, Alexander the Great and Jesus lived for only 33 years, and there are 33 degrees in Freemasonry. The Gnostics may have best preserved the meaning of 33. Among their watermarks was a symbol combining the 33, the figure 4 (= divine equilibrium) and the let ter H. A vital clue for the explanation of these symbols is found in the following passage from The Perfect Way : “ I n order to gain ‘Power and the Resurrection,’ a man m ust first of all be a Hierarch , that is to say he must have attained the magical age of 33 years.” Another way of looking at Hierarch is as hier (sacred) arch, or sacred arch of the hare (or heron).

A particle accelerator is a device that speeds up the movement or vibration (thereby altering the rhythm or key) of tiny bits of matter. The “particles” newly named in atom smashers, are known as resonances , another musical term. They are the nodes that stand for a moment on a guitar string, strung on the background of something very continuous (the basis for “String theory”). American physicist Ernest O. Lawrence invented the first particle accelerator in 1930; a circular accelerator called the cyclotron. The cyclotron accelerator forces beams of subatomic particles such as positively charged protons or negatively charged electrons to flow in a nearly circular path and to strike a stationary target or to collide with another beam that is moving in the opposite direction. The resulti ng impacts break particles away from the target or cause other subatomic particles to form. Lawrence received the 1939 Nobel Prize for physics for this achievement. The particle accelerator enabled nuclear scientists to study the secret rhythmic nature or “key of life.” With it they were on their way to being transformed from pass ive observers of the nuclear mysteries of nature to active participants in the process of creation.

It appears in medical terms as in meta kinesis, the stage in cell division in which the filaments of the nuclei separate and pass toward the poles of the cell. In Rome, the meta was the plural form of met, and was the name for a triple and conical turning rod, post or pillar placed at each end of the track in a Roman circus (a poetic way of referring to the blood cell, where the circus of l ife unfolds). Circus derives from Circe . Circe also gave her name to the word circle or sur- cul (to separate, to pick out). Sur is a prefix meaning to bring over , beyond . It is the root for sura , a division or chapter of the Kore-An. Fascinatingly, a sur-cle is a twig or a little shoot. In Greek, twig is klone .

Upon closer inspection the Antients lead us to the story of Ptah, the Egyptian god whose hieroglyph includes a DNA helix. It is Homer who leads us in the direction of Ptah. Homer’s classic work the Illiad begins in the middle of a war between the Achaean Greeks and Trojans. Many historians believe the real reason for the war was for t he control of Troy, which was situated along a trade rou te leading to the lucrative East. The hero of the Illiad is Achilles, the son of Peleus (“mud” or “darkness”) and Thetis, a sea goddess. Most of his body was invincible because his mother dipped him in the river Styx. The spot on his heel, where his mother held him, was not treated with the healing waters of the river. Therefore, he could be, and was, killed by a n arrow in his heel. Thetis is the daughter of Chyren, the shamanic healer and teacher who is half-man, half-horse. Chyren, we noted, taught Aescule-pius his knowledge of drug plants.

In addition to Achille s , his pupils included Jason the Argonaut who sought the Golden Apples of Immortality of the Hesperides, Hercules, and all the o ther heroes of the generation before the Trojan War. When Achilles grew up he became king of the Myrmidons of Pthiotis: presumably by marriage to one of their princesses. The name Pthiotis (Pit-hi-otis) simultaneously rings of Pythagoras (Pit-a-goris) and Ptah (Ptah-it-is), the Great Physician of Egypt, and the greatest of all the gods of Memphis. As we shall see in more detail when we fol low the story of Ptah, these links may not be as frail as t hey at first appear to be.

The Lord’s Prayer, for example, is called the Pater Noster in Latin. So too is the Rosary. 24 The Latin patere means to be open.

Myrmidon means ‘ant’. This may explain why Webster’s applies this term to “an unquestioning follower or subordinate who carries out orders without scruple or hesitation.” 25 Strabo recorded a myth that the Myrmidons were ants transformed into men after a plague had depopulated the whole island. Homer says that ants show solicitude for their comrades, alive or dead, and that they exhibit ingenuity. They are a universal symbol of industry, th rift, providence and forethought. In the Old Testament ants symbolize wisdom – “Go to the ant thou sluggard: consider her ways and be wise.” 26 The Hindus use the ant as an example of the transience of existence.

An apology is a taking back of a word. Osiris was known as the hare. Whether these teachers are called Masaw, wayshower of the Ant People of Hopi myth, or E.A., the Fish Man, leader of the Merman (Myrmidon), they appear to possess the teachings for opening the “clouds” of consciousness and revealing higher worlds.

Hall, to the Pythagoreans the term palingenesis from Pala (the root of Palladium, which lined the Pillar of Osiris) and gene sis, is equivalent to metempsychosis or reincarnation. He furth er comments are most illuminating: “ By reconstructing plants from their own ashes the alchemists sought to prove not only that consciousness and intelligence survive the annihilation of the physica l structure, but that they retain the individuality t hey formerly possessed and remain as organized forces. The term palingenesis was used to indicate the rebirth of the universe from its periodic sleep or t he replenishment of the Earth after a cataclysm, such as the Flood .” 41 As if this is not enough to link the Palladium pillar to the secrets of creation and the body there is more. According to Hall: “ Some students of Hermetic philosophy affirm that by means of palingenesis it would be possible to resur rect the human body even at a long interval after death .” 42 At Mari the temple housing the Palladium was called the bit mummu or womb-chamber, where (s)tone statues of the god were said to be “born” (brought to life), or the bit. shimti , or the House of Shimti, “the house where the wind or breath of life is breathed in.” 43 The name Shimti may explain why Apollo, the god of Tula, was called Smithy or Schmity . He was of the divine race. As noted, according to Sitchin, the Akkadian word employed in Mesopotamia to translate the Sumerian SHI.IM.TI was naphistu – the exact parallel of the biblical term nephesh , and referred to something in the blood. 44 The end result of these ceremonies was the birth of a king who was born of a ‘virgin’.

The human body is the Hermetic bottle. ” 46 The ‘material organism’ in Hermetic philosophy is th e original matter from which we are created.
