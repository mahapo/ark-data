Like many transplanted Tennesseans, I felt compelled to stay in ‘the Athens of the South’ but did not know why. Nashvillians often hear transplants say they feel l ike they were pulled to Nashville. Visitors wonder what is it about Nashville that giv es it that ‘feeling’? Most know that Nashville is called “Music City U.S. A.” because of country music. Nashville is also called “the buckle of the Bible b elt,” a group of Southern states whose residents are known for their fundamentalist interpretation of the Gospels. One of fundamentalist Christianity’s most important beliefs is in the Holy Bible as the literal Word of God. Nashville is the major center for Bible publishing on Earth. In a way this makes it the center for the “W ord of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 God.” Why, of all places, did Nashville achieve thi s position? Why not Rome? Or Jerusalem? These questions were mere curiosities to me until t he summer of 1998. That’s when I learned about the spi ritual mysteries of Nashville. By the time I encountered these mysteries I had alr eady traveled to many distant sacred lands. I am an investigative mythologist. Ever since 1982 one of my passions has been seeking the mysteries and secr ets of the Crucifixion and its primary artifact, the ‘Holy Grail’. Everyone who has ever seen the movies Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade knows what the Holy Grail is. It’s the Cup of Christ, right? Well, partly right. In Christian terms the Holy Gra il is the focal point of the mysterious ritual millions of Ch ristians partake in every day: the sacrifice of the Mass, an d also the equally mysterious Holy Communion in which Jesus’ b ody is offered in the form of bread along with the communa l wine, the ‘Blood of Life’, 1 drunk from the cup of life, the Grail. The Holy Grail is symbol for a deep Mystery teachin g. A sip from this wisdom cup opens the doors of percept ion and reveals the realm of immortality. As you will see, my concept of the Grail deviates considerably from traditional lines. Far from seek ing a simple carpenter’s cup from another millennium, I am seeki ng a Grail that is a powerful soul-centered science and techno logy for our modern age. I think Jesus wielded far more powerful secrets tha n we have ever dreamed. Little did I know that my search for these secrets would return me to my own back yard, to the Capitol Mall in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 3 Nashville, Tennessee, or that my search would help me answer the question: what is so special about Nashville? Nor did I realize my search would steer me to F.D.R ., one of America’s greatest heroes, who shared my desire to find the Grail, the way to make undreamed-of things possible . It was letters from F.D.R.’s Secretary of Agriculture that ultimately led me to believe that Nashville is the new City of Peace, the new home of the Grail. Here’s how it happened. MAGICAL JOURNEY One day, at Magical Journey bookstore, I had the pl easure of meeting Elijah “Reggie” Wooten, the elder brothe r of the world famous Wooten Brothers family of musicians. Reggie read my book The Peacemaker and the Key of Life , 2 and was excited to talk with me about my research. In this book I chronicled the mysteries and spiritu al teachings of the herald or forerunner of Christ. Th ese teachings are symbolized by the caduceus, the ‘wand of the Peacemaker’ and ‘rod of healing’. The Book of Revelation says Christ will rule with t his ‘rod’ upon his return. 3 Reggie was curious about where I thought this rod w as today. I told him I honestly did not know. I knew more abo ut its past than its present. Little did I know at that ti me that our conversations would lead me to conclude that Nashvi lle is a present location for this rod. Hebrew legend, 4 states this rod and was made from a branch of the Tree of Life that grew in the Garden of Eden."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 4 Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses were all keepers of this rod and benefactors of its secret knowledge. One by one as they reappeared throughout history th ese Peacemakers reclaimed this necessary piece of equip ment, used it to unite Heaven and Earth, and then stored it for future use. The ‘rod’ of the Peacemaker includes the caduceus, the symbol of healing, and the radiant light of illumin ation. Fully interpreting this symbol reveals the mystic secrets of the Peacemaker. 12 th century woodcut from Rennes, France."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 5 Before early Hebrew and Christian times Egyptians symbolized this healing ‘rod of Peace’ in the hands of the Peacemaker and god of magic named Thoth, who wielde d it along with the Key of Life. He used this combined t echnology to unite Upper (‘heavenly’) and Lower (‘earthly’) E gypt and to bring Osiris back to life (below). Thoth (right) holds the Key of Life to the nose of Osiris, giving him the breath of life. He holds the caduceus in hi s other hand."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 6 A gifted guitar player and music teacher, Reggie de eply impressed me with his conviction that music was the Key of Life I was seeking. “Look at it. The Key of Life is even shaped like a guitar... or a woman,” he observed with a smile. He was right. The loop of the ankh , the Egyptian symbol for the Key of Life, does resemble the body of the guitar with its neck attached. ‘Ankh’ or Key of Life holds the ‘world’ aloft. It is vital to note that following a strict genealo gy, esoteric Egyptologists believe Thoth reappeared in the form of an Egyptian pharaoh named Akhenaton, who ruled Egypt f rom 1364-1347 BC. Akhenaton introduced a monotheistic Mystery religio n based upon the principles of a hidden Central Sun t hat he"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 7 called Aton , or simply ‘the Disk’.

Vatican Museum."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 9 Aton is a word play for a tone or a tune . Aton is also the root for Adon or “Lord,” a title later given to Jesus. It is quite apparent from the connection between th ese names and the continuity of the depictions of T h o t h , Akhenaton and Jesus above that the secrets of Peace (the unity of Heaven and Earth) had something to do with music (tones or keys). These connections also suggest Jesus perpetuated th e Egyptian teaching of Thoth and Akhenaton. Interestingly, when, in the Bible, Zecharia prophes ies that the Lord will be carried into Jerusalem on an ass h e uses the word athon , so close to Aton . In Hebrew the male ass is called the hamor (‘hammer’), the she-ass athon. 5 It would make a staggering difference if the Hebrew scribes, fond as they were of word play, used the w ord athon as a pun for Aton or a tone, the Key of Life. THE SHED Our conversation started innocuously enough. Howeve r, it became readily apparent that Reggie and I shared so me assumptions that seemed perfectly sensible to us, b ut which might be tough to assimilate for some folks. Foremost among these ideas was that music is one of the highest forms of spiritual and mythological communication. It holds a key to deciphering the mysteries of the ancients. This tiny jammed latch holds the door to the shed h ousing the secrets of the Key of Life shut for most folks. Most people would not have opened that door, but Reggie Wooten is not most people."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 0 Properly assessed, observed Reggie, the electric gu itar is a modern version of the ‘magic hammer (axe or ass) of the gods’, another name for the Key of Life. I agreed. The tones played by rock ‘n’ roll’s magicians chang ed the world. Avatar axmen, like Jimi Hendrix, are the like shama ns of times past. The lightning bolts streaming from an e lectric guitar are like the sparks of light from the shaman ’s rod of power. They’re capable of channeling higher love an d altering the heart consciousness of all that hear their tones. Rock ‘n’ roll connected millions of Earth’s childre n to a divine universal tone: love. This is why the early rock ‘n’ roll experience spawned the love and peace movement of t he 1960’s. That’s why love is such a hot topic in rock ‘n’ roll songs. Ask the average person what the Key of Life is, and you’re likely to hear them say it is love. All you need is love. This may be truer than we realize. As an investigative mythologist I am always on the lookout for ways in which history repeats itself or how the modern mind synchronizes with the ancient mind. In particular, I look for evidence of the return of th e gods of times past. Ancient Egyptian myths say the original bearers of the Key of Life came from the stars (the Sba star of love, Venus – amor in French). 6 I have long been fascinated by the curious fact that, in addition to love, so many hit rock ‘n ’ roll songs include references to angels, ET’s and other realms. The Saba or ‘love gods’ dwelled at Mt. Meru , 7 where was also located a placed called Ida (which may be the root for"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 1 Iuda or Juda ). 8 I invited Reggie to visit my web site and read about the people of Amor and one of my favorite pla ces of mystery in America: Mt. Ida, Arkansas. Into the quartz crystal at Ida, say Buddhist myths, the Saba gods projected sacred knowledge. 9 Find these rocks and you find incredible knowledge. So, where are these crystals? One clue to Ida’s (and Meru’s) location surely come s from a Celtic (Druid) legend that maintains the original mountain of the goddess was made of glass or crystal. 10 Some believe the Great Pyramid of Giza near Cairo, Egypt is the original Meru. As fabulous as it is, the Great Pyramid (which is m ade of sand, a form of glass) is a copy of the original gl ass Mount Meru. Strangely enough, there is only one Mt. Ida anywher e on Earth that is a mountain of quartz crystal. That is Mt. Ida, Arkansas . In this fact there is an immense (and scary) questi on. Did the myth of Mt. Ida originate in America? Did the g ods originally land in Arkansas?! To the average person I’m way out on limb with that question. The average person has probably not looke d into the matter. Reggie, on the other hand, impressed me as someone who had ‘hit the shed’ in this regard. He readily accep ted the idea that Mt. Ida, Arkansas could have been the original Ida of myth, and that the original glass dwelling place of the gods was in America."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 2 Taking this line of speculation a giant step furthe r, he suggested that some ancient myths may even have ori ginally taken place in Nashville! Though this thought is hardly compatible with histo ry, it is nonetheless possible. I had long since been of the view that the history of America is incomplete. The history b ooks we read are neither solid nor impartial. Reggie’s speculation hit home for me for another reason. In addition to researching the Peacemakers and the Grail, over the past decade I had been researching the loc ations and myths of the Grail Mystery schools. These Cities of Peace, which the ancients called Tula or Sabala (aka Shambhala, home of Mount Meru), dotted the planet. The Tula complexes were known as Mystery sc hools where Heaven and Earth connected. People gathered t here to learn the secrets of the gods. A fascinating map presented by Dr. J.J. Hurtak 9 that showed the location of former Cities of Peace had i ntrigued me. His locations neatly matched my research. The kicker of his map is that it included Nashville. Nashville is on a ‘pearl necklace’ of sacred sites – “Tula complexes” -- that encircles the Earth and includes: • the Giza Pyramids of Egypt, • Lourdes and Rennes-le-Chateau, the home of the Ca thars in the wine country of Southern France, • Sinkiang near Mongolia, • Hawaii, • Vancouver, British Columbia • the Four Corners Area of the Southwestern United States (where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet). • Oak Island, Nova Scotia, and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 3 • the Southeastern quadrant of America including Kentucky and Tennessee. Actually, the inclusion of the Southeastern U.S. sh ould not have surprised me. Mammoth Cave, just up Interstate 65 north from Nashville, is protected by the United Nations World Heritage Society. The UN flag flies there, just as it does in Cahokia, Illinois, the massive pyramid complex near St. Louis that is less than six hours from Nashville by car. After Reggie glanced at the map, he raised his eyes toward me. He then let loose an astonishing question. “Did you know Nashville was once a Native American burial ground?” he asked. “There are stories of the discovery of an ancient grave with a seven foot skeleton in Brentwood,” continued Reggie. “What!?” I thought. Were there really giant stone-a ge bubbas running wild in ancient Nashville? “Can I get a reference on that?” I asked. “Oh sure,” said Reggie. “It’s in a book about ancie nt Nashville.” This is the kind of story that ladies in the refere nce room at the library have fits over. Sure enough, however , there is an “acceptable” reference concerning the existence of these seven-foot tall giants. Today the rolling hills of Brentwood are covered wi th some the most desirable neighborhoods in Nashville. Immediately after the Civil War, they were covered with tall, lush native forest. As told by Dr. Joseph Jones, 10 a prominent nineteenth century Nashville archaeologist, a giant stone grav e was found on one of its beautiful hills, covered with a growt h of forest."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 4 The remains of an earthwork and several flat-topped pyramids were nearby. Inside the ancient grave was the skeleton of a seve n-foot tall man. Even by recent (pre-1900) standards a seven-foot ta ll man would have been considered a ‘giant’. MYSTERY TOUR When Reggie offered to give me a tour of the ancien t Nashville burial sites it was an invitation I could not resist. I quickly informed my sister, Kim, and brother-in-l aw, Donny Hinkle of Reggie’s exciting offer and arrange d for the three of us to join him to have a look see around t he ancient titan’s backyard. Kim, Donny and I had been exploring the secrets of the Holy Grail together for the better part of ten year s. We are always on the look out for the next piece of the puzzle. We focused on the Grail in its esoteric sense. In a ddition to being a ‘hardware’ container or device (which we will look at momentarily), we viewed it as a mysterious body of spiritual teachings, the ‘software’ for making it work. The key to elucidating Jesus’ secret teaching conce rning the Grail is to remember that, in esoteric terms, a lchemists know the Holy Grail as the ‘Stone of God’. 11 It is equated with the Philosopher’s Stone of Immortality. 12 (Some believe the Grail’s secrets -- which enable the transmutation o f the elements -- are literally written on a stone.) We had long considered that the Stone of God was actually a (S)tone or a tone of healing. It is a chord (or cord) that links man and God."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 5 In other words, the Key of Life and the Key (S)tone or Holy Grail are the same thing. Essentially, the “quest for the Grail” was the ques t to get our DNA to ring, sing or vibrate a certain way. Thi s created a “love song in the blood,” a San Graal (‘Holy Blood’ ) or Song Grail , that tunes our souls to the Key of Life or the to ne of immortality. With this love song in our hearts, purer blood flow s through our veins. Purer blood in our veins brings more oxygen to our brains, opening our spiritual vision. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus addressed this whe n he said, “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.” 13 Reggie’s focus on music as the Key, we believed, wa s in tune with ancient belief. Our problem was we didn’t know that much about music. We had about a million questions for Reggie. As Reggie pointed out, music’s pre-eminence in the minds of the ancients is affirmed by the fact that many i mportant biblical figures, including King David, were musici ans first prophets second. 14 Reggie was about to put my quest for the Grail in t he fast lane."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 6 1. IN SEARCH OF SEVEN-FOOT TITANS “For the fairest land From God’s own hand Is the Basin of Tennessee” 1 With a bright sun in a pristine blue sky and advent ure just around the corner, Reggie, Kim, Donny and I met at Magical Journey bookstore. We packed into Donny’s car and h eaded off to see Nashville as we have never seen it before. Our tour began with a drive-by of the Parthenon, th e recreation of the Athenian temple of the goddess At hena in Centennial Park (which we will explore in more deta il shortly). A goddess of war, peace and wisdom, Athena sprung f ully formed from the head (intellect) of Zeus. 2 The smith-god Hephaestus aided in this odd caesarian birth with h is axe. 3 (As Reggie would remind us, guitar players call the guitar an axe.) Next, we headed to the neighborhoods near downtown Nashville... in search of the stone gravesites of sev en-foot tall titans. As we drove I thought about the dream we were chasi ng and the synchronicity we were on the verge of manifesting. A Long, Long Time Ago..."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 7 Ancient mariners knew about Atlantis, the “Island” home of the Titans beyond the Pillars of Hercules (the R ocks of Gibraltar -- the only gate to the Atlantic Ocean fr om the Ancient World). Greek sailors had been to Atlantis and were allowed to leave. Their incredible stories about it faded during the Crusades, however: Atlantis sank in a Sea of Ho ly Intolerance. During the Renaissance Columbus discovered a “New World” beyond those same Pillars (1492). Christendo m, however, failed to make the connection between what he discovered and what Greeks had called Atlantis. 1490’s Europe believed that savages, not intelligen t beings, peopled Columbus’ virgin “Island of America .” Europeans failed to realize that America was, in fa ct, the same place that ancient mariners had visited and had cal led “Atlantis.” THE TITANS In 1998, at a press conference in their new home, Nashville, it was announced that the Tennessee Oile rs NFL football team would officially change their name to the “Tennessee Titans.” I was amused by the way that, mythologically speaki ng, the NFL Titans neatly match the original divine rac e of Atlanteans in Greek myth. Some link the Atlantean Titans with the gods the Bi ble called “Els” (L’s), Elohim or Shining Ones . 4 These are the same gods who brought the Key of Life to Earth."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 8 Before these Titans came to Earth they rode the sta rways. 5 Upon arrival on Earth, these “sons of gods saw the daughters of man and took them for their wives.” 6 The Nefilim (Hebrew for ‘giants’ or ‘titans’) were also on the Earth in those days and are clearly related to the Titans. Nefilim stems from the Semitic root N F L (“to be cast down”). 7 It means exactly what it says. As we can see, the ancient Nefilim Titans and the m odern NFL Titans had exactly the same name. The ancient Titans were called the “sons of Thoth o r TAT” (whom some say is Adam). Bud Adams owns the Tennessee Titans. Some Nashvillians pronounce the w ord Titan with a heavy southern accent so it sounds lik e ‘TOT-in’ (rhymes with HOT) or ‘TAT-in’. Every now and then I ’ll hear a caller on the sports talk radio show say he was a t the “ TOT- ins” game. I think to myself, “Wow, he pronounced it right.” Incidentally, Atlas , the leader of the Titans (for whom Atlantis was named), shares a connection to Thoth. Atlas wa s shown holding the world on his shoulders (exactly a s the Key of Life supports the circle full of specks in the d epiction above). Closer inspection reveals that this Titan’s ‘world’ was actually a zodiac full of stars. This ‘world’ is a container of secrets. To the Egyptians this ‘world’ was full of nu or nuclear energy. 8 In Egyptian terms from his outstretched arms Atlas upheld the Word or the life force energy – the Key of Life -- upon which the world is built. As I look back, the Titans/Atlantis connection was my first tip-off that the mystical and magical archetypal wo rld or word -- ‘wor(l)d’ -- was attempting to make a cosmic con nection in real world Nashville. It made me wonder: was Atlant is rising"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 9 again from Nashville? If so, is the Key of Life in Nashville too? THE NOEL FARM We turned off Woodmont Blvd. onto Lealand Ave. and headed towards downtown Nashville. Reggie showed us street after street of rectangular raised mounds, approxim ately thirty feet wide and three feet tall, with small houses sitting on them. “Those mounds are Indian graves,” said Reggie. We were driving on an ancient burial ground and did n’t even know it. We were actually driving around what used to be cal led the old Noel Farm. In 1890 Gen. Gates P. Thruston, a Civil War general of the Army of the Cumberland and wealt hy business man, discovered an Indian cemetery on this small patch of Eden several miles from the heart of Nashville. He remarked, “It is within the bounds of truth to s tate that, after a century of occupation by the Whites , the burial grounds of the aboriginal inhabitants , within a radius of thirty miles from this center , contained a greater number of graves then the aggregate of the present cemeteries of the Whites within the same limits.” 9 If we could have been given a glimpse of the fair v alley of the Cumberland a thousand or so years ago we would have found a settlement teeming with life and activity. The Cumberland River comes into Nashville from the east. It makes many turns or bends and flows out of the city on the west side. Most of Nashville is in two of these bends. The ancient stone-grave cemeteries of Middle Tennes see are timeless memorials of the ancient race that lived here."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 0 The dead were placed in tombs or cists made of flat stones carefully placed. Many of these graves contained mu ltiple skeletons. Sometimes they were laid in three or fou r tiers, forming burial mounds that contain more than a hund red graves. Today, the site of these graves is a part of Nashvi lle known as Berry Hill. This area is named after the Berry’s, a prominent Nashville family. In ancient times, however, it easily could have bee n called Bury Hill because it was a massive cemetery. Another extensive burial ground lies on the opposit e bank of the Cumberland. One of these mounds appeared to Dr. Jones to have been the burying place of a royal family. 10 Gen.Thruston considered the Nashville area to be th e great metropolis of the Stone Grave people. Assisted by s killed collectors on his payroll, by 1890 Thruston had ran sacked and completely obliterated some 3,000 to 4,000 of these stone graves. Who were these people buried in this ancient cemete ry? Who were these ‘ aboriginal indians ’? These questions would become the next stepping ston es in my path to finding the mysteries of Nashville. FORT NEGLEY Next, Reggie took us to Fort Negley, the highest po int in Nashville. After its capture in 1862, Union forces developed Nashville into the most fortified city in North Ame rica. A series of forts ringed the city, the largest and so uthernmost being Fort Negley, named for U.S. Gen. James Scott Negley,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 1 provost marshal and commander of Federal forces in Nashville. The remains of Fort Negley are located on a high hi ll south of downtown Nashville at the confluence of In terstates 65 and 40 and adjacent to the Cumberland Science Mu seum and Greer Stadium. The site, known as St. Cloud Hil l, was a favorite picnic area for citizens prior to the war. Fort Negley was a complex fort, many of its feature s based on European forts. The fort is 600 feet long, 300 feet wide, and covers four acres. It used 62,500 cubic f eet of stone and 18,000 cubic feet of earth. Personally, I was captivated by the geometry of the structure. The east and west parapets are partially star-shaped, the redans allowing concentrated crossfire against attackers. This star design gives Negley an enchanted feel. The air holes, plainly evident on its wide rim, lea ve little doubt that the bulk of this facility is underground . The city of Nashville hopes to turn Negley into a lucrative tou rist attraction. THE CAPITOL Negley’s twin peak is just across 8 t h Avenue. The old Nashville water reservoir occupies this space. It i s built on a massive terraced hill. After walking around this immaculate park-like sett ing we cast an eye straight down 8 th avenue to the splendid artificially tiered mound upon which the Tennessee State Capitol sits. The long path of the Capitol instantly reminded me of the National Mall in Washington D.C."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 2 The Tennessee Capitol (above), Teotihuacan, Mexico (below)"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 3 The Capitol’s tiered hill and its lay out reminded me also of the phenomenal Mexican city of Teotihuacan (Te-oh-tee- WAH-kahn) -- the “City of the Gods” -- near Mexico City with its long avenue and massive tiered pyramid. Te otihuacan was a city designed to integrate human life with th e life energies of the universe. It was built to harmonize the individual with the Word upon which the world is bu ilt. Due to its layout Teotihuacan is considered the sister city to Karnac, Thebes (Egypt). Deep inside Teotihuacan’s Pyramid of the Moon, Ariz ona State University archaeologist Saburo Sugiyama had found something incredible. 11 While tunneling toward the pyramid’s center, Sugiyama’s team uncovered the skeleton of a man who died about 1,800 years ago. He was buried with hund reds of rich offerings such as greenstone figurines, obsidi an knives, eagles, and jaguars. According to legend, the leaders of Teotihuacan wer e buried underneath the pyramids. Since this burial w as the richest ever discovered in Teotihuacan, experts wer e betting that the skeleton was that of a ruler -- the first ever found. As I looked at the Capitol observations raced throu gh my mind. A royal family buried in a mound. A long aven ue culminating in an artificially tiered pyramid-shape d hill. These observations prompted me to think of Nashville in a ncient terms. Further, as a burial ground was Nashville a city of resurrection, similar to Teotihuacan? Was Nashville an ancient necropolis? Did “aboriginal Indians” gather in Nashville to learn the sacred instructions for entr y into the next world?"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 4 If so, who, exactly, were these people? It is with understandable enthusiasm that I pursued these mysterious questions. F.D.R At the same time my eyes were being opened to the fascinating history and mysteries of ancient Nashvi lle, I was immersed in research on a new book. Called One Foot In Atlantis: The Secret Occult History of WW II and It s Impact on New Age Politics, 12 in this book I explored the hidden history of WW II. Included was the Nazi search for the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail in Southern France. While the Nazis sought the Grail and lost teachings of Christ at the ‘Tula complex’ in Southern France, 1 3 in 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Secretary o f Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace, sent Nicholas Roerich (pronounced rurik, from the Viking rook, ruk or ‘ rock ’), a flamboyant and world famous Russian archaeologist a nd painter to Mongolia. F.D.R. and Wallace, a corn geneticist, were thoroug hly beguiled by Roerich’s extravagant tales of healing herbs and drought-resistant grasses in mystic Mongolia. They claimed they were seeking these grasses. However, as reported in Newsweek magazine, 1 4 in the Roosevelt Administration, it was common knowledge t hat F.D.R. and Wallace were actually looking for the re incarnated Jesus atop mystic Mount Meru in Shambhala (from SaBaLa). In the 1920’s Roerich had traveled the Far East thr ough Cashmere, Tibet, China and Mongolia in pursuit of t he secret teachings of Jesus. 15 Upon his return he formulated a blazing"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 5 path to spiritual enlightenment that combined eleme nts of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, pantheism and eve n the theory of relativity. Wallace was a disciple of Roe rich’s teaching. 16 Roerich was put on the payroll of the Department of Agriculture and dispatched to Mongolia with quasi-d iplomatic papers signed by Wallace to conduct the search on b ehalf of Wallace and F.D.R. As I would soon learn, letters written by Wallace t o Roerich suggested that the results of Roerich’s 193 4 expedition in Mongolia would be returned to Nashvil le, Tennessee. In order to illuminate this connection, it is impor tant to familiarize ourselves with a few of the myths of Meru. Mystic Mount Meru exists on the borderland between the mythical and the mundane world. It is the source of Buddhist, Hindu, Taoist and shamanistic religion. Buddhists consider Meru as the spiritual and phenom enal center of the world, ‘the Forbidden Land of the God s’, 17 a part physical and part psychic secret place inhabited by beings who were once human but reached the sacred land bec ause of their spiritual progression. 18 Tibetans conceive of Meru as the central source of earthly power and government. 19 The Nazis were racing F.D.R. to Meru to ‘network’ with the inhabitants of this worl d center. In the Nazi view the dwellers of Meru were none other than the survivors of Atlantis. 20 Ancient truths and knowledge from highly evolved cultures have been associated with Mongolia for cen turies. Stories concerning this knowledge circulated Europe for"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 6 centuries as well. This is likely the source of Roe rich’s belief in the Meru-Mongolia-Christ connection. Interestingly, in 1555 the French prophet Nostradamus had predicted that in July, 1999 the King of Terror wou ld come out of the sky and resurrect the King of Mongolia. In Holy Grail legend Jesus is called the King of Te rror. 21 This appellation is a reference to the profundity o f the secrets he wields. In hindsight this appears to be a failed prophecy o f Nostradamus. I am reasonably certain that Jesus did not appear in July, 1999. However, I am captivated by the fact that, of all p laces to seek Christ, F.D.R. should pick the same location a lso pinpointed by Nostradamus. GRAIL KNIGHTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE Although unknown to most Americans, F.D.R. and Wallace envisioned themselves as knights of the Hol y Grail who were on the ultimate quest. Along with Roerich, F.D.R. and Wallace enacted (with all due respect) the arch etypal role of the ‘three wise men’ searching for Jesus. F.D.R.’s interest in the Grail was no mere hobby. I n the weeks before the 1940 Democratic Convention F.D.R a nd Wallace were still deeply interested in Grail legends. As Wallace recorded in his diary on April 12, 1940, 22 they investigated the foundations of Glastonbury Abbey, atop the ‘glass mountain’ in Somerset, England. Glastonbury was considered the home of King Arthur’ s court of the Holy Grail and the “island of the immortals.”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 7 Christian Grail legend claims that after the Crucif ixion Joseph of Arimathea brought the Holy Grail to Glastonbury. F.D.R.’s interest in Holy Grail-related sites and l ore began in his 20’s when he explored the infamous Oak Islan d Holy Grail repository in Nova Scotia. 23 Oak Island (another location on Dr. Hurtak’s map) a repository for Grail secrets. Nine French Knights Templar had removed these secre ts from the ruins of the Temple of Solomon atop Mount Moriah ( Meru-iah or Meri-Ra ?) in Jerusalem in the early 1100’s. A brief look at how a portion of the secrets of the Grail ended up at Oak Island will benefit us. For more than five thousand years, the bloodiest ga me of king-of-the-hill has been for the supremacy of the Temple Mount. Here reside the greatest treasures of histor y. Yet no one seems to agree exactly what it is: golden relic s, extraterrestrial stones, sacred geometry, alchemical formulas? Solomon’s Temple was build in the middle of the ten th century BC. 24 The Bible tells us King David brought the Ark of the Covenant and other treasure to Jerusalem and wished to make it his capital city. 25 Unfortunately for David, God had other plans. A pro phet named Nathan informed David that because he shed th e blood of other men it would be improper for him to build the House of God, the new Meru. The Lord proclaimed that Solo mon, David’s son, would be given the honor. 26 Solomon’s name means ‘Peace’. His temple, which he shared with his wife the Queen of Saba (Sba, or love ), was a place of Peace, a connection point between Heaven and Earth. Solomon’s Temple was destroyed by the Babylonian Ki ng Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC when most of the Jews were taken into Babylonian exile. It was rebuilt by King Zerub babel in"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 8 515 BC. 27 This structure was overrun by the Syrian King Antiochus Epiphanes in 170 BC who removed a portion of the Temple Treasure. 2 8 In 63 BC the Roman legions under Pompey overran the Temple. The Second Temple of Solomon was completely overhauled by King Herod the Great during his reign from 36 BC to 4 BC. Jesus -- who was born into a wealthy priestly famil y of the royal lineage of David and Solomon 29 -- might have seen this Temple the way his contemporary the Jewish historia n Josephus saw it: (Mount Meru-iah was) “overlaid all around with stou t pieces of gold. In the first rays of the sun it ref lected so fierce a blaze of fire that those who endeavored to look a t it were forced to turn away as if they had looked straight at the sun. To strangers as they approached it seemed in the distance like a mountain covered with snow ; for any part not covered with gold was dazzling white.” 30 The prophet Ezekiel 31 claimed Solomon’s Temple marked the location of the Navel of the Earth. In the Holy of Holies of the Temple we find a rock outcropping called the Sheti-yah or ‘Foundation Stone’. Orthodox Jews believe it was from this (S)tone of D estiny that the whole word or Wor(l)d was said to be woven. Thus, it appears the Key of Life was housed in Solo mon’s Temple of Peace. The Temple was a ‘needle’ connecti ng the thread ( cord or c h o r d ) between Heaven and Earth, thus creating Peace: the unity of Heaven and Earth. On one Passover festival weekend Jesus violently confronted the moneychangers in the Temple’s Court of the Gentiles. 32 From the Temple’s eastern porch, known as the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 2 9 Portico of Solomon, Jesus spoke to a crowd in messi anic tones and was nearly stoned to death as a consequence. 33 Later, one of the Temptations of Jesus, would take place on the Temple’s southeastern ‘pinnacle’. 34 This was the same spot where Jesus’ brother James would be cast down and killed in 62 A.D. 35 This pinnacle was so high, claimed rabbis, that from its very top “an Arab with a spear looked like a flax worm.” 36 It was the magical Temple of Solomon that Jesus, wh o taught that the Kingdom of Heaven is within, sought to destroy (or transcend) with his teachings. 37 The Romans overran the Temple in AD 70. But not bef ore the Essene followers of Jesus removed the Temple tr easures and buried them around Jerusalem. This was confirmed by the discovery of a Copper Scr oll at Qumran near the Dead Sea. The scroll was a treasure list detailing sixty-four locations where the treasures of the Temple were hidden. 38 138 tons of gold were included in this treasure. It is unknown exactly what knowledge or artifacts t he Templars recovered from Jerusalem in 1100 AD. One t hing is known, during their persecution by the Catholic Chu rch in 1307 it was revealed that the Skull or Head of God symbolized these secrets to the Templar. 39 It is also a fact that upon returning to France the Templars inaugurated the Cathedral age. Dozens of cathedrals were constructed. Some, like the fabulous Notre Dame in Paris and Chartres cathedral are considered to be ‘books in s tone’ and repositories of the secrets of the Temple -- and Je sus’ secrets of transcendence (which is why so many cathedral st atues hold books)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 3 0 THE CATHARS During my travels I traced the trail of the secrets of these ‘Knights of Christ’ from Jerusalem to Southern Fran ce. There I studied the mysterious land of the Cathars. This esoteric group of Gnostic Christians called themselves the “ Pure Ones” and maintained they possessed the Book of Lov e, the secret teachings of Jesus. 40 Fearing contenders to its power, the Catholic Church exterminated the Cathars in the first European holocaust because of these secrets. Following a tradition that dates to Old Testament t imes, 41 the Cathars symbolized these secrets -- the secrets of the Grail -- by a cluster of grapes 42 they called “ blue apples .” 43 Like the blue rose, the blue apples are an alchemic al symbol of the impossible. 4 4 With these secrets one can perform miracles. The Cathars are named after Catherine, the dancer a t the fiery wheel at the central point in heaven 45 (which the Greeks called Tula). Sir Galahad, who was symbolized by th e letter ‘g’, brought her to Earth. 46 From Southern France I traced the trail of the blue apples to Edinburgh, Scotland. Near Edinburgh, in the land s called Roslin, was located a healing well and a chapel, Rosslyn Chapel. Designed by William St Clair beginning c . 1434 AD Rosslyn Chapel is called a rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon. It has the original nine Knights Templar b uried in its vaults.

It is also claimed that William St Clair had the fo resight to realize that the Grail secrets could be tampered wi th. He constructed Rosslyn as a ‘book-in-stone’, and then moved a portion of his family secrets to Oak Island, Nova Scotia. As a young man F.D.R. owned shares in a mining company that was attempting to recover the treasure of Oak Island. 48 According to biographer Geoffrey C. Ward, 49 as President F.D.R. frequently used the story of the Oak Island treasure (and his failure to find it) as a filibuster to pre sent visitors from bringing up topics he did not wish to discuss. During his first meeting with F.D.R. in 1933, the n ewly appointed Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, “listened in wonder as the President-elect spun the tale out for an hour and a half, while Senator Key Pittman of Nevada dru mmed his fingers, waiting for a chance to talk about his own pet subject, silver.” F.D.R. never let him speak. It seems beyond coincidence that F.D.R would have a long-term personal and financial interest in Oak Is land. One wonders if gold was the true treasure of Oak Island that attracted a man of F.D.R.’s wealth and intellectual stature -- and family background. If not gold, what then is buried at Oak Island?

After he moved his wife and family to New York in the 1920’s he criss- crossed the country. As always, he was on a search for some thing: the dwelling place of the gods. After many years of research Roerich concluded that the origins of Hindu-Buddhist mythology emanated from a group of beings called the Blessed Ones who came to Earth from the constellation Orion, the “Dwelling of the Gods.” 1 These inter- dimensional beings were called the Ousir , the root of Osiris. They lived in the nine-storied Mount Meru , and live there still according legend. Scholars have had difficulty saying exactly where t he original Meru was located. 2 Meru’s Buddhist name, ‘Sumeru’, obviously rings of Shumer , Sumer or Sumeria , ‘the cradle of civilization’, in present day Iraq. Sumerian texts speak of the Mother-mountain where t he sun god ascended and descend through a gateway formed by two pillars on his daily trip through the heavens.

Theirs is the true story of three men joined by a s trange force of destiny. THE GURU LETTERS While researching their astonishing association, I focused on deciphering a handful of the 117 letters that we re written by Henry Wallace to Roerich. 7 Known as ‘the Guru letters’, for their opening salu tation “Dear Guru,” most concern esoteric, religious and o ccult subject matter. These letters, which became politic al dynamite, for Wallace, are glowing endorsements of Roerich by Wallace. Though laced with secret code names to protect the identities of the officials involved, and to concea l the true nature of the events he was discussing, “the Guru” letters reveal extraordinary occult contemplation by the Se cretary of Agriculture and even the President. In one letter Wallace expressed his conviction that he was witnessing the “first crude beginnings of a new age .” He left no room to doubt that his ‘new age‘ would be direct ed by a god-being who influences earthly political affairs -- and wou ld be introduced by the recovery of the Holy Grail.

Wallace’s biographers and researchers, including Pu litzer Prize winning journalist Westbrook Pegler, uphold t he profound significance of these letters, although th eir occult meaning has evaded detection. In one astonishing letter Wallace says: “ I have been thinking of you holding the casket -- t he sacred most precious casket.

Galahad was also supposedly the last descendant of Joseph of Arimathea, an uncle and secret follower of Christ. 9 According to lore, when the Grail is discovered and the Golden Age commences every inhabitant of the Earth will know and understand how the universe works. An age of miracles will begin. Wallace’s letters make it clear that F.D.R. and Wal lace not only sought the Stone of God, but also if my interp retation of their actions is correct; they appear to have found something of tremendous value. This something , I will show, was connected to Nashville. First, let us answer an important question. What ev idence is there that they found anything in Mongolia? One piece of evidence is on the back of the one dollar bill. In 1935, one year after the search for Christ in Mo ngolia, the Great Seal of the United States was ordered sta mped on the back of the one-dollar bill by F.D.R. at the re quest of Henry Wallace and Nicholas Roerich.

The author of Matthew must have been deliberately referring to the Great Pyramid. There is only one t ype of building that has a chief cornerstone and a capston e: that building is a pyramid. 10 Further, the most famous building in the world with a Divine purpose is the Great Pyramid.

THE HEAD OF GOD What exactly is the Head of God whose recovery kicks off this Golden Age? For an answer we may turn to the M eru myths of the ancients. In addition to Mongolia and America, another powerf ul corpus of Meru myths is also found in Egypt. One of Egypt’s oldest names was Ta-Mera -- “Land of Love.” 13 When we search Ta-Mera for Meru myths we learn that the ancient Egyptian gods constructed a Pillar at Meroe , a royal necropolis or city of the dead whose place name is phonetically close to Meru . 14 The ancient Egyptians claimed this Pillar housed th e head of Osiris, a god who came from the stars, taught th e art of gardening and conquered the world through music.

According to Holy Grail historian Andrew Sinclair, 19 in the French History of the Grail the cup, dish or pl atter used to collect the transformed Blood of Christ on the Cros s (the Scala Dei or “ladder to heaven”) was called the escuele (pronounced ‘skool’ or ‘skill’). In its Christian dimension the escuele is the Holy Grail -- the mystic receptacle used by Christ to perform the Eucharist at the Last Supper when he poured wine for the disc iples to drink, saying, “this is my blood.” If Scala, Skool and Skill is a word play for Skull or Head, then the secret the Templars recovered -- and ‘the three wise men’ sought in Mongolia -- was the Skill or Wisdom of Jesus concerning the Ladder to Heaven.

And what connection, if any, may this have to the Chald ean myth of a Garden of Eden called Omoroka? 31 Specifically, could John have been visiting Tenness ee, the land of the Three Stars before he came to the City of Peace to introduce Jesus? While there is no way to answer this wildly specula tive question with certainty, as we will see we are not the first to question if lost tribes of Israelites were living i n America before Christ. The Mormons deeply uphold this belie f and have amassed enormous evidence to support this belief. The fact that the Mandaeans were believers in Manda or Gnosis (Greek, for ‘knowledge’ or Nazoraean as they called themselves) brings up a humorous connection.

THE SEVEN STARS OF NASHVILLE In his letter to Roerich Henry A. Wallace wrote of the “seven stars going forth to meet the three stars.” We’ve looked at one interpretation of the three stars. No w, to what do the seven stars refer? As noted, in the ancient world, a powerful group of seven stars was the constellation Ursa Major the Great Bear . Astonishingly, in Arab tradition, Ursa Major was ca lled Na’ash or Nash , the Great Coffin! 1 The dual definition emerges from the phonetic and vibrational similarity of the words bear and bier or coffin. Further, in Arab myth the stars were the children o f Na’ash who mourned for him who had been murdered by Al Jadi , 2 the present pole star. (The name Al Jadi and its p ole star appear to be similar to the Djed pillar of Osiris, and also ring of Solomon’s name, Jedidiah or Jed-idia-h .) The Arab association of Nash with a Pillar or coffi n is made even more stunning when we remember that Nash- ville (‘the seven stars’), Tennessee (‘the three stars’) is a giant Indian graveyard, a great coffin!!! In Indians and Artifacts In the Southeast , 3 Bert W. Bierer affirms this. “A considerable portion of the city o f Nash- ville,” he says has been built over an extensive In dian"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 5 7 graveyard.” He further says, “The ancient burial gr ounds on the banks of the Cumberland River, in 1844, extende d more than a mile along the river.” In Time magazine’s 1998 Almanac Nashville, Tennessee is listed with its legal and official name -- Nashvill e Davidson (from Davidson county). When we trace the origins o f these words some amazing correspondences to our story develop. Let us begin with the prefix ‘nash’. First of all, the Hebrew word for serpent is NAHASH . The Hebrew word for soul is NASHAMAH . In the mythological ‘Language of the Birds’, these two words are phonetically similar, t herefore they are interchangeable. So, the word Nashville ca n mean both “Serpent City” and “Soul City.” Phonetically, soul is sol, which is the sun (son). Who is the son (soul or sol) of David (Davidson), but Solomon, whose Temple housed the Head or Skull of God. This brings us to the Great Seal of Nashville-David son and its depiction of an Indian holding a Rod or Spear and a Skull . The TENNESSEAN made a good point when it said he is looking thoughtfully into the skull ala William Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The seal of the Metropolitan Government of Nashvill e and Davidson County was created with the formation of Nashville’s Metro government in 1963. The new seal represents the combination of the Nashville city se al and the Davidson County logo. The meaning of the Indian holding the Spear and Sku ll is a mystery. Nashville’s fourth mayor, John T. Elliston , made the first engraving of the Great Seal of Nashville. Whe n the city’s charter was passed in 1837 no explanation was given of the seal’s meaning."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 5 8 The Great Seal of Nashville-Davidson. In 1949 THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN offered $300 in cash prizes for the best identification of the I ndian on the design and explanation of the symbolism.

In the 1780’s Oc onostota battled John Sevier over a ceremonial center called “Old Stone Fort,” near Manchester, Tennessee (near Nashv ille). Formed by high bluffs and twenty-foot walls of ston e, Old Stone Fort’s fifty acres was also protected by a mo at twelve hundred feet long. In a story recounted by Smithsonian historian Roger G.

Oconostota obliged. He told him the legend of Welsh Prince Madoc (or Merodoc) and the White Indians, on e of America’s oldest legends. It is the amazing saga of the Twelfth Century seafarer that established settlemen ts in the middle of America three hundred years before Columb us. We shall return to the story of the White Indians later. Whoever the Indian in the seal of Nashville-Davidso n Indian is supposed to be, he stands between an eagl e and tobacco stalk, symbols of enlightenment and peace. He holds a bundle of arrows under his right arm. A fleur-de- lis is mounted on the top of the radiant Seal. According to Bob Hitt, 5 the designer of the updated Seal of Nashville, the fleur-de-lis was put on it as a r eference point. So whoever puts the seal on a surface can get it st raight. It has also been said that the fleur-de-lis or flower of l ight symbolizes the iris that flowers during the Nashville springs. The fleur-de-lis is also called the Lily of France. 6 Because the people upheld it as a sacred symbol it was plac ed on many banners and coats of arms. It eventually came to sy mbolize French royalty in general. 7 Interestingly, Tennessee was originally called the state of Franklin, after the statesman. Linguistically, however, Franklin is ‘Frank or Fran ce land’, making the fleur-de-lis an appropriate symbol for N ashville, the capital of old France-land. I find it fascinating to interpret the features of the Seal of Nashville-Davidson as Christ images. The crucifixio n of Jesus took place at Golgotha, ‘the Skull’. 8 The fleur-de-lis if often associated with Christ and the Virgin Mary. When th e"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 6 0 archangel Gabriel impregnated Mary with Jesus she w as holding the lily. The secret teaching of Skill enables us to open our spiritual vision, our optical ability, perhaps thro ugh the iris of the eye. The official flag of the city of Nashville is also worth noting. It shows a blue star on a large white X fra med by an olive branch, the symbol of Peace. According to a commemorative description of the fla g signed by former Nashville mayor Ben West, the blue star signifies Nashville’s pre-eminence as the Capital C ity of Tennessee. “The great white rays emanating from the star are symbolic of Nashville’s reputation as a city of enl ightenment, a center of education, culture, medicine, and religion.” Because of its emphasis on education Nashville is c alled “the Athens of the South” after Athens, Greece. In the Greek mysteries, a figure who is closely ass ociated with the Grail Pillar is Pallas-Athena. She is wide ly known as the helmeted and girdled goddess of war and peace. Greeks claimed she was born from the head of Zeus, after he swallowed her mother Metis. 9 However, she was already widely known in Egypt and Jerusalem as the spear-sh aker Anath (below), from which came her name Anath-enna or Athena. 10"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 6 1 Pallas Athena, the Spear Shaker, was muse of Willia m Shake- speare.

When Sir Francis Bacon became Lord Chancellor of England under King James I he adopted the symbol of Pallas- Athena, who was called “The Spear-Shaker,” as his e mblem.

THE NASHVILLE MOUND Undoubtedly the most phenomenal of the icons of Nashville is the Tennessee Bicentennial Mall complex. The Tennessee Capitol Mall complex was constructed in 1997 to commemorate Tennessee’s Bicentennial and to preserve an unobstructed view of the State Capitol, architect William Strickland’s temple of Tennessee democracy. Strickland was an associate of Thomas Jefferson. 1 He came to Nashville from Philadelphia just prior to t he outbreak of the Civil War to build the Greek Revival temple as a symbol of a new golden age for the state’s acropolis. 2 A Catholic church was torn down to make way for the new temple which sits atop a tiered mound strikingl y reminiscent of the Teotihuacan temple complex in Me xico City as well as Glastonbury Tor in England. Long before this the site of the Mall had been a pl ace of enormous repute. The high, round top of this hill used to have large trees growing upon it; and there were so many cedar trees it was first called the Cedar Knob. Looking from Capitol H ill in any direction, we see other beautiful hills. They seem to make a circle around the city."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 6 4 In Early History of Nashville 3 published in 1911, we learn that in 1767 when the first white settlers came to Nashville they found the Mound that is the site of present da y Capitol Hill. Early Nashville lore tells of the white hunters nea rly getting trampled by a galloping herd of buffalo. 4 Following the herd they were led along a buffalo track that l ed to a large spring of fresh cold water. Many people living in the country have, on occasion , heard of water dowsers, strange characters who can tell where there is water, its depth, its rate of flow and its mineral content. These people are also called ‘diviners’. T hey are sensitive to the vibrations of the Earth. Water in the Earth is the same as blood in our vein s. Animals instinctively follow the tracks of unseen e nergy lines from underground water-flows. They know that underground flows forming invisible tracks will lead them to a conjunction or surface s pring and therefore to a supply of Earth’s life-blood -- water. The buffalo tracks converged at a spring. Here the elk, the deer, the bear and wolves had stopped to drink, for in addition to the buffaloes their tracks could be seen all around. The hunters rested a while under the large oak tree s. Then they followed the well-beaten path toward the north east. They noticed other paths converging on theirs. It became broader, opening into a wide space where there were no bushes and little grass. The pounding feet of animals had trampled the ground for many years. In front of them was a steep hill which rose high above them. At the foot of the hill was a muddy place. All arou nd it and in it were buffalo and elk and deer. The hunter s fled to"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 6 5 higher ground and watched the menagerie. When it wa s clear of animals they investigated the muddy area. They found that clear, sparkling water was oozing u p from that muddy ground. On tasting it, they found it was strong salt water, clear and cold. The place, the site of the C apitol, was named “The Salt Lick.” The low land north from the Capitol was called the Sulphur Spring Bottom, because a sulphur spring is found down there. This spring was the cause of Nashville’ s being where it is. That high hill south of the Lick had a round top li ke a knob. Long ago it had many cedar trees growing upon it. Today it is home to the Tennessee Capitol, a temple of democracy. Through this valley a large creek ran to the Cumber land River. This wonderful place was called Lick Branch. Between the salt spring and the Cumberland, north o f the Branch, there was a strange mound. It was very larg e. Grass was covering it. It was obviously man made. On top of it were rough old wooden posts. They asked the Indians who built it. But the Indian s claimed to know nothing about it. The oldest of the m said that their grandfathers had said that it was there when they came, and that was all they knew. 5 Once some men were digging near the Mound and found some curious graves lined with stone. After that ma ny of these graves were found all along the gentle slope of the Mound. The Indians could tell nothing about these either. 6 Upon digging into the Mound and the graves it was discovered that the same people had made the stone graves and the Mound."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 6 6 Whoever they were they must have selected this site for a reason. The fact that graves were found in the Moun d implies that it was a religious site. In 1779 a group led by James Robertson, a colonel i n George Washington’s army, followed the buffalo path s to the Big Salt Lick near the Cedar Bluff. 7 There they saw the Sulphur Spring Bottom just as th e first hunters had. They came from the settlement at Watau ga in what is now upper East Tennessee, walking overland. Robertson’s party is considered to be the first per manent settlers to arrive in what is now Nashville/Davidso n County, Tennessee. In keeping with the law, they knew that in order to claim this land they would have to plant a field of corn, the symbol of rebirth, there. 8 So, over the Sulphur Spring Bottom on some of the r ich ground corn was planted. When he left to secure off icial “cabin rights” to the land, Col. Robertson left thr ee men to keep the buffalo from returning to their watering h ole and trampling down the corn. James Robertson is credited with giving the new settlement the name of “Nashborough” in honor of hi s friend Gen. Francis Nash. A North Carolina officer Nash ha d been killed in the battle of Germantown, in 1778. 9 In 1784 the name was changed from the Scotch Nashborough to the French Nashville by act of the N orth Carolina Legislature.

A new district of North Carolina was created, compo sed of Davidson, Sumner and Tennessee Counties, i.e. all o f Middle Tennessee. It was called the Mero District in honor of Governor Mero of New Orleans. 13 Like Nash, this name, Mero, so close to Meru, is obviously synchronistic with our story.

The Mandan were “white Indians” conversant in the Welsh tongue, English. An intimate relationship existed between the Mandan mound builders of Nashville and the other tribes of the Central Mississippi district that probably built the massiv e truncated mound at Cahokia, Illinois (shortly after the aband onment of Teotihuacan), and the burial mounds near New Madrid , Missouri and in Northeastern Arkansas. No one can compare the pottery from the stone grave s of the Cumberland valley with the vessels dug up at th e base of the Cahokia mound and at New Madrid, Missouri witho ut observing that the majority of them are identical. There are some glowing traces connecting these trib es with the ancient pyramid builders of Mexico -- who claim their ancestry at Tula in Mongolia. 15 The Mississippian people who adopted many customs from the Indians of what is now Mexico, with whom t hey may have traded, founded Cahokia. Like the Mexican Indi ans, the Mississippians built large, flat-topped temple moun ds (like the one on the one dollar bill) in the center of their cities as depicted here in a painting by Lloyd K.

One of the largest mound sites in the United States is Poverty Point, near Epps, Louisiana. It was include d in the Louisiana Purchase conducted by Jefferson. The main part of the site consists of a group of six octagonal terra ces, one within the other. The largest octagon has a diamete r of about 4,000 feet (1,200 meters). Poverty Point is probabl y more than 3,000 years old. 17 Many scientists think the religious monuments of Mexico’s Olmec Indians (ancestors of the Mayans) in fluenced the people who designed Poverty Point. According to another theory, Indians learned mound building from the Vik ings, who explored part of the East Coast of North America ab out AD 1000. But the Indians began to build mounds at leas t 7,000 years ago, long before the Vikings arrived. The Mound Builders disappeared long before the Puri tans first arrived in America, leaving more than 10,000 burial mounds containing objects of art, tools and weapons. THE MEANING OF MANDAN Mandan , ‘Man of Dan’, is obviously the same as Mandaean , the followers of John the Baptist. Dan is the old er brother of Joseph of the Coat of Many Colors fame. They are known in Irish Celtic/Druid history as the Tuatha d e Danaan (pronounced: too-AH-duh-DAN). The Viking explorers of America, like Bjarni Herjul fon, Eric the Red and his son Leif Ericsson who landed i n America long before Christopher Columbus, were Danes (Dan-i sh), descended from their Israelite father Dan. 18"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 7 1 Linguistically, the American founding Pilgrim-fathe rs and the Anglo -Saxon American people are descended from Jacob/Israel’s favorite son Joseph, of the Coat of Many Colors fame.

The English and the Anglo-Americans are Angel-o’-Saxons. Could the Mandans be the Men of Dan (and the Tuatha de Danaan), one of the lost tribes of Israel, the seed of Abraham? Did they come to America and lose themselves racial ly in the genetic pools of certain American tribes?

He devoted sixteen of his fifty-eight chapters to the Mandans, explaining: “I have dwelt longer on the history and customs of these people than I have or shall on any other... because I have found them a very peculiar people.

The Mandan also attributed some of their religious beliefs to this white culture-hero who had instructed their medicine men.

The depiction on this stone is identical to the sce ne in Catlan’s Mandan painting. A group of people dance a round a central pillar. In this case the pillar emits a spi ral or vortex of scalar (‘Skiller’) energy. Dr. Barry Fell claims that in the middle of the tab let is a scene celebrated by a priest of Osiris named Wnty (‘star- watcher’) in Iowa around 700 BC. 25 In the center, says Fell, is the Egyptian Djed column of Osiris made of a bundle of reeds encircled at the top by four or five rings. 26 The Egyptian text above the spiral vortex, says Dr. Fell, can be rendered into English as: To a pillar attach a mirror in such manner that when the sun rises on New Year’s d ay it will cast a reflection on to the stone called “The Watcher.” 27 Surrounding the engraved scene on middle of the tab let are inscriptions in three languages; Egyptian, Iber ian Punic, and Libyan. 28 Now known as the famed Davenport Calendar Stele, Dr. Fell claims the stone depicts an Egyptia n Osiris Festival celebrating the Egyptian New Year on the m orning of the March equinox. 29 The Egyptian word for March is Koiakh , 30 a word that, to me, is phonetically quite similar to Cahokia .

Worthwhile reading can be found the works of Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas who make the ca se that John the Baptist and his Mandaean followers were al so devotees of Osiris. 31 The Templar, they claim, also made the link between John the Baptist and Osiris. They understood the secrets of the Holy of Holies of Solomon’s Temple. These secrets, I speculate, centered around the Pillar of Love. When did they bring these secrets to America? Was i t in the 1400’s when William St Clair dispatched the sec rets of Rosslyn Chapel to Oak Island? Or was it earlier? A speculation is proffered here. Seventeen hundred years before the arrival of the Templars in 721 B.C. Sarg on II of Assyria liquidated Israel and turned it into an Ass yrian province. He sent the northern tribes of Israel int o an exile from which they have never returned. It is claimed that several of the tribes fled to Af ghanistan and Kashmir and settled in the lush valleys amongst the mountains of north India. 32 These ‘lost tribes of Israel’ as they are called, may have taken the treasures of the Tem ple of Solomon, including the Pillar of Love, with them."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 7 8 Fascinatingly, a town bordering Kashmir is called Mari , which means Mary (and love).

The bell formed an essential element in Ori ental religious usage, and in Celtic/Druid Christianity i t was regarded as the God-head. The Court of Three Stars is the throat chakra where the Word is heard. The crown of the god- head is yet to be constructed, but is planned. Perhaps the most energetically active area is the C ourt of Three Stars. On the ground at the Tennessee Temple the Three Stars form pentacles. These ten-foot wide pentacles are perfectly cut into the masonry of the Temple floor. Based on the symbol of the Goddess Kore in the appl e core, the pentacle means ‘health’ or ‘life.” 6 Significantly, the pentacle is featured in an amulet known as the Seven Seals (or Stars), and is the first of its holy signs. 7 In Judeo-Christian tradition, the Seals were inscri bed on Solomon’s magic ‘ring’ (tone). 8 Jesus carries these same Seven Seals when he appears in the Book of Revelation. 9 Together, the aforementioned triceps and the pentac les suggest the Capitol Mall is a pagan temple.

Speculative though it may be, it is my contention, based upon applying the science of mythology to their wor ds and actions, that the participants in the founding of N ashville and the design of the Capitol Mall were a group of peop le in obvious synchronicity with the “consciousness” of Meru and the Holy Grail. They were building a City of Peace and did not know it. What is a synchronicity and how can this offer proo f of my thesis? A synchronicity is a meaningful coincidence. Life i s full of these events. For example, have you ever thought of a friend calling at the instant that the telephone rings and it is they on the other end? That is a synchronicity. History, especially scientific and literary history , is full of these at times bizarre occurrences. When Jonathan S wift wrote Gulliver’s Travels in 1726 his hero met Laputian astronomers who had told Gulliver that Mars had two moons, and that one of them revolved around the red planet in ten hours. At the time the book was published no one kn ew Mars had any moons. On August 11, 1877 astronomers disco vered that Mars had two moons. Swift’s insight remains on e of the most interesting unexplained scientific and literar y questions of English literature. For another example, Norman Mailer first visualized his novel Barbury Shore there was no Russian spy in it. As the story unfolded, a Russian spy emerged as a main cha racter.

H e was charged as a top spy in the United States at that time. Physicist Wolfgang Pauli and occult-minded Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Carl G. Jung named the concept of synchronicity (from s y n , same and chronus , time). 16 Synchronicities have been called the bridge between matter and mind. They strike unexpectedly like lightning, alerting the individual to the existence of a hidden order, a cr eative universal energy, expressing itself in individual lives. As a disciple of Sigmund Freud, Jung believed the s oul was constantly trying to get the ego’s attention. The s oul, including the “collective soul” of humanity, engine ers all sorts of attempts to call us into spiritual initiation. S ynchronicities are the “calling cards” that we are on the path. On ce we are on our way these happen constantly transforming our ex istence into one of effortless harmony. The extent and cohesiveness of the many coincidence s or synchronicities between the design of the Central A sian Meru Temple and the Tennessee Meru Temple are as astonis hing as they are explosive in their implications. MERU-SIC CITY These synchronicities even extend to the name of Nashville, Mu-sic City and M e r o District. If we look at ‘Nashville’ in the way of the ancients, as a moral fable and spiritual instructions, we find interesting food for thought.

Psyche is Greek for ‘soul’, hinting that these psychic secrets are potentially within each of us. When we add M u together with psyche we render Mu- psyche (pronounced Mu-sike or Mu-sic ). Spiritually, the name Mu-sic City connects the Nash ville Mero District to the psyche or soul of Meru. The names of Nashville highlight the presence of an unseen hand picking at the heartstrings of the collective soul of humanity... in Nashville.

The answer to that question hi nges on whether or not there is a glass mountain concealed beneath the mound upon which Tennessee Sate Capitol building sits. Celtic (Druid) legend that maintains the throne of the goddess was made of glass or crystal. One such glas s mountain was Glastonbury Tor in England, the center of King Arthur’s court of the Holy Grail (Arthur comes from Asur or Osiris ), which the Celts called Crystal Island.

ANCIENT CHRISTIANS IN NASHVILLE One of my speculations drawn from the evidence I ha ve presented is that early Christian prophets knew abo ut and even visited Nashville. In this chapter I will present f urther evidence in support of this incredible thesis. Exhi bit “A” is the Thruston Stone. General Thruston made extensive searches of the loc al Nashville sacred sites. Thirty miles north of Nashv ille, in Sumner County, near the stone graves and mounds of Castalian springs he discovered the remarkable tabl et pictured on the next page. He called this ancient engraved t ablet a “Group of Tennessee Mound builders.” 1 In Thruston’s view this tablet bears evidence of ve ry great age. On the left side the tablet shows a character with a shield bearing the double serpent. “The serpent was a favo rite emblem or totem of the Stone Grave race of Tennesse e, and is one of the common devices engraved on the shell gorgets taken from the ancient cemeteries,” wrote Thruston. 2 Engaged in a stand-off with the serpent-bearing figure is a man with the circles-within-circles symbol of the sun.

These words mean anointed . To the Hebrews, the Messiah is the expected king and deliverer. To the Christians, the Messiah is Jesus, the Christ. And to the Hopis, Massau is the deliverer and purifier who came before and who will return fr om the east as Pahana, the ‘true white brother’ of all the Hopi s, the peaceful ones. At exactly the same time the Hopi Indians were livi ng in America, across the world, the Essenes lived at Qum ran in Palestine. The Essenes practiced a form of democrat ic community life taught by the Teacher of Righteousne ss based on the Ten Commandments of Moses ( Meshu ). Correspondingly, the Hopi were living an identical form of life and following the laws of a great master-te acher called Massau . The Hopi say Massau gave the Hopi commandments or laws written on Sacred Stone Tablets and taught the m to live in a true democracy in which every individual has a bsolute freedom, but is responsible to the whole. They awai t the return of this teacher whom they call Pahana or the ‘true white brother’, and the reappearance of his sacred books. 4 In her excellent book He Walked the Americas , 5 L.Taylor Hansen chronicles the travels of this “Prophet” as she calls Pahana.

From here he continued north into Canada and due west to the Olympic peninsula. He th en turned south journeying down the coast of Californi a and finally arriving in Arizona. Everywhere he went this pale-skinned, blue eyed, bl ond headed prophet performed miracles, healed the sick, taught the principles of peace and encouraged vegetarianism. The Hopi claim there will be two forerunners to the return of the ‘true white brother‘ who will witness for hi m. One messenger will carry a swastika and the other a sun disk, which many interpret to be Germany and Japan. In th is regard it is interesting to read Revelation 11:3: “And I shall give my power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophecy. . .” In Book of the Hopi 6 Frank Waters states that when the ‘true white brother‘ returns to the Hopi he will be ar the missing corner piece (stone of peace) of the sacred tablet, deliver them from their persecutors, and work out w ith them a new and universal brotherhood. One can only wonder if the Thruston Stone plays a r ole in the fulfillment of this prophecy. THE THREE-NAIL H IN AMERICA Beginning in 1850 a collection of strange and controversial black slate plates began turning up i n various places in Michigan. 7 These plates portray an arresting array of unusual symbols and ancient scripts, some of which strongly resemble the cuneiform script of ancient Sumer or Sumeru."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 00 Many of these plates tell picture stories of the Cr ucifixion.

This symbol is a three-nail H (the symbol for the Eucharist and the Fish God) acc ompanied by two additional nails. An identical “mystic H symbol” was discovered in Il linois on a stone artifact portraying a Christian resurrection. A man nailed to a cross is shown with the mystic sy mbol above his head. In the 1950s, a Chicago lawyer name d Henrietta Mertz was the first researcher to identif y the “tribal mark or mystic symbol” as she called it.

Nullifying this claim is the fact that the mystic s ymbol appears on many of the thousands of Michigan tablets (which are now in the possession of the Church of Latter Day Saints in Utah.) The sheer number of the artifacts suggests that an individual or a group of individuals would have had to toil for years to expedite this conspiracy. This seems unlikely. However, this is not the only fact supporting their authenticity. In his investigation of the Michigan relics, David Deal was able to convincingly translate from the qu asi- Hebrew script on the “Christ stones” the name of tw o sons of a deity-figure featured on the Michigan tablets as “Son-of-the- Right-Hand” and “Son-of-the-Left Hand.” 9 In biblical stories told on the tablets, these figu res engage in a mythic battle of light and dark. These charact ers are more than strikingly similar to AMOR and ROMA, the two complimentary gods of the Cathar scheme of things. The similarity between AMOR and A-MER-U gives one cause to speculate if they are the same realm. In 1947 the Dead Sea Scrolls revealed that the Esse nes believed there is a cosmic battle between the “sons of Light” and the “sons of Darkness” (also known as the “Cong regation of Baal”). Deal writes, “the fact that the Michigan Christians of the Fourth Century AD were aware of this angelic conflict and modern Christians are not, is the major point to ponder.” 10 How did the people of Michigan learn about this con flict in 400 AD, more than fifteen hundred years before t he rest of the world?"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 03 Did the Celtic Druid ancestors of Thomas Jefferson, who were the Mound Builders, bring them over?

The runic sign mannaz stood for “humanity.” 12 Cross-checking this symbol with Chinese pictograms (since the Tun-Huang manuscript came from there) we find the same ‘flags’ or ‘gates’ of the symbol of mannaz .

Likewise, the Land of Shambhal a, with Mount Meru as its center, has 96 principalities. Essentially the Court of Three Stars is an enclosure. In fact, a visit to the site reveals that the 50 ma ssive pillars that stand beside the stars do form an enclosure. When one stands in the very center of this structur e an eerie acoustical effect is formed. One hears their voice reverberate off the pillars. It feels as if you are standing in the middle of a domed enclosure. When you speak your voice is greatly magnified. You feel as if your words are spiraling from your m outh to God’s ears, as if the Court is the tip of a cone. This spiral effect is reminiscent of the Apocryphal Acts of John , in which Jesus speaks to his twelve disciples as they circle around him. Jesus says,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 07 “I am a lamp to thee who sees me... I am the Verb who did dance in all things.” Then, later as the Crucifixion unfolds, Jesus is at tached to a pillar. The term INRI is inscribed above him 16 (interpreted esoterically as “ by fire humanity is renewed whole ”). 17 John records how: “My Lord stood in the midst of the cave (cone or vo rtex) and filled it with light.” Once the cone is filled we drink in the holy water, our DNA vibrates (or INRI-Vertebrates) at a new frequen cy. All matter is composed of Holy Light and sound waves vi brating at different frequencies. Perhaps the original foll owers of Jesus knew the secrets of sound, rhythm, vibration and frequency and thereby controlled the elements of creation. As we might expect, the Court of the Three Stars ar ea corresponds with the throat chakra of the human body system. Interestingly, each of the pillars has a menacing l ooking aluminum spike jutting from its top. These are lightning rods. From another perspective they resemble toothpicks. ‘Teeth’ they may well be. This is the mouth of God, the gate to the higher wo rld, after all. In the Goddess tradition the gate is called the yoni or vulva . Mouth/gate/vulva symbolism is interchangeable. Th e mouth is equated with the vagina dentata ( toothed vagina). 18 The word yoni refers to the Oriental Great Goddess Cunt , the slang for vagina. 19 Cunt comes from the same root as country , kin , and kind , the Old English cyn (sin), as well as cunning and ken : knowledge, insight, remembrance, wisdom."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 08 The tree of knowledge of good evil, the tree of ori ginal sin , was the Cunt’s Tree.

Does this explain why country music plays from Nashville, the center of the Word or Wood on Earth, the only city that features a Cunt Tree? Is country music the music of the Goddess? Medieval clergyman perceived obscenity in female genitalia. They made ‘cunt’ an obscene word. Simila rly, they made sacred places identified as female holy shrine s and groves obscene as well calling them “devilish cunts.” Is this what we are seeing in the Chinese hieroglyp h above? Do the triangles look like teeth , because the are the teeth of a vagina? “Mouth” comes from the same root as “mother” – Angl o- Saxon muth , and Egyptian Maat truth. Vulvas have labia , “lips,” and many men have believed that behind the lips lie teeth. Christian teachers of the Middle Ages taught that witches could grow fangs in their vaginas. 20 This witches mouth was called Hel, and was the same mouth that swallowed Jesus for three days. Hel was equated with the womb-mouth symbol of the whale that swallo wed Jonah (from Oannes, the ‘fish’). Another way to look at the number of teeth, 50, in the Court of Three Stars, and the oak trees (grove) tha t line the Long Path of the Temple, may be in view of the stor y of Jason (whom some equate with Jesus) and the 50 Argonauts.

Near this city was a hill thickly covered w ith oak trees that were sacred to Jupiter. The oracle of Do dona was presided over by Jupiter, who uttered prophecies th rough oak trees, birds and ‘talking’ vases of brass.

Tinia wielded a hammer and three thunderbolts, also known as a Trident, the “triple key.” 24 The first key he could wield or play freely.

THE LOST TRIBE IN TENNESSEE Another noteworthy and controversial archaeological find is the Bat Creek Stone, discovered in 1889 in an un disturbed burial mound in Eastern Tennessee by the Smithsonia n’s Mound Survey project. In 1971, Hebrew scholar Cyrus Gordon identified the letters inscribed on the stone as Paleo-Hebrew of approximately the first or second century A.D. Acco rding to him, the five letters to the left of the comma-shap ed word divider read, from right to left, LYHWD, or “for Judea.” 1 The Bat Creek Stone.

In 1988, wood fragments found with the inscription were Carbon-14 dated to somewhere between 32 AD and 769 AD. These dates are consistent with the apparent date of the letters. Dr. Robert Stieglitz of New York dated the stone to the first century AD. 2 He reads the inscription as “A comet for the Jews,” with reference to Hailey’s Comet, which “hun g over Jerusalem like a flaming sword” in the year 69 AD, during the First Revolt, begun in 68 under Nero. “The evidence” writes Dr. Fell, “suggests that Kent ucky and Tennessee became havens of refuge for persecute d Hebrews after the various revolts against Syrian Gr eek and Roman oppression.” 3 There is great controversy over the age of the Bat Creek Stone. First, and most importantly, bracelets found in the same burial mound date to the 18-19th century -- meaning that the stone probably didn’t find its way into the mound u ntil then (so it could have easily been brought over after Columbus)."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"CITY OF PEACE 1 23 “Recent tests by our Conservation Laboratory on the brass bracelets found in the same grave definitely establ ished that they are 18-19th century trade goods and do not hav e the chemical composition of brass of the Roman or early Semitic periods.” 4 SONGS FROM MASADA The Jews rebelled against the Roman occupation. “Th e Jewish War,” as it is termed by Flavius Josephus, a military commander and historian of the era, was provoked by the Romans’ insistence that their insignia -- the eagle -- and statues be allowed into Jerusalem and the holy temp le of Solomon. At this the Jews revolted because of their prohibition against idolatry. They eventually were defeated and surrounded at the fortress of Masada. Almost a thousand Jews took their own lives rather than accept Roman symbols in the holy places, believing that they had thus ch eated the Romans of their victory and would rise again at a f uture bodily resurection. 5 The Roman emperor Nero, who ordered this attack, wa s interested in more than just the real estate of Jer usalem. Detailed accounts tell of the deployment of his son Titus to recover the Ark of the Covenant, which was housed a t Solomon’s Temple atop Mount Meruiah. Awaiting the Romans at the Temple were the zealous Nazarenes. They are believed to have taken drastic measures to hide the scrolls containing secret teachings.

One of these scrolls was the Copper Scroll , the ‘treasure map’ which lists the Temple treasure and the existe nce of twenty-four other scrolls. Titus’ forces stormed th e Temple, wiping out the Nazarenes. Some escaped to Masada wh ere they were finally killed off. It is still a mystery as to exactly what treasure was taken from the Temple and if it e nded up at Masada. Hebrew legend maintains that some of the followers of John the Baptist were among the faithful at Masada. Some of these Mandaeans escaped with the secret teachings o f John and Jesus. Is the Bat Creek stone a reference to the existence of these teachings in Tennessee?

The home once belonged to Nashville mayor, Richard Fulton. Aside from the fact that the home has a spectacular forest set ting, the inside had special appeal. The entire foyer was don e in blue roses. The wallpaper did it. They bought the h ouse. In the ten years he lived there Garth became not only the king of country music, but the king of pop ( rock or ruk ) music as well.
