Several serious proposals for designing gateways or digging holes to other parts of the Milky Way have been presented in technical journals within the past few years. What was once the esoteric domain of shamans and mystics is rapidly becoming the exoteric, leading edge of science -- and will soon revolutionize the practice of medicine into a precise, divinely inspired, soul-centered healing science. I’m convinced one of the questions apt to preoccupy historians and theologians of the future, say of 2150 or 2200, is the blindness of their ancestors. How did they live not knowing they were immortal? How did they live without understanding stargates? How did they not see stories of stargates as the dominating theme in the Bible? How could they not see the Bible teaches us how to find and build a stargate? Like Americans looking back at their ancestors plodding across the harsh plains of America in covered wagons and wondering how in the world they did it, our children’s children will wonder how we ever thought about traversing the galaxy in a tin can starship, and with hearts that are separate from our minds. The ancient stories assure us that stargates are real. They exist. And one may have been opened by Jesus and Mary Magdalene."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dedicated To the woman clothed with the Sun"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 1 1. RENNES-LE-CHATEAU “They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.” Deuteronomy 33:1 This mystery ‘called’ me what seems a lifetime ago, in 1982. Back then, I was an innocent sophomore at a small, very southern Baptist college in Nashville, Tennessee; the kind where dancing and chewing bubble gum were forbidden. I’ll never forget one particular bright and crisp fall morning. There I sat, minding my own business in my sociology class. Suddenly, my professor -- an ex-Marine and Bible-thumping former Texas marshal -- took a long sip of coffee, and without warning, assigned us to do a book report. “Review a current book whose theme would affect Christianity,” he said. I answered the call like a wise-assed kid, and wrote a 44 page, John Lennon-inspired ‘review’ based on the controversial bestseller Holy Blood, Holy Grail . 1 (It was that or a report on a book that solved the puzzle of William Shakespeare’s identity and what’s really hidden in the bard of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 2 Avon’s tomb.) Boom! It was the end of innocence for me. In 1982 John Lennon’s Imagine was the song for me. He asked us to imagine a world without devisive religion. In their blasphemous work Holy Blood, Holy Grail authors and BBC documentary-makers Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln asked us to imagine no Crucifixion, too. In gripping fashion they presented astonishing, supposedly incontrovertible, evidence to support their heretical hypothesis that the Crucifixion of Jesus was actually a cruci- fiction , a carefully scripted drama! After the Crucifixion, say legends, an alive and well Jesus traveled to Egypt, India 2 and perhaps even America. 3 Mary Magdalene traveled with Philip the Apostle and other early Christians, and landed at Ratis, a place now called Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, near Marseille, France . 4 According to the legends that spread through the grapevine of Southern France, Mary Magdalene was a temple priestess of royal lineage. The Midi and Languedoc regions were her ancestral lands. Mary lived in retreat in Rennes le Chateau, then at St. Baume (Aix en Provence) where she died (AD 63). 5 The same authorities say that when Mary arrived in France she was pregnant with Jesus’ child. As Mssrs. Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln keenly observed, if one breaks the word sangraal , “holy grail,” after the ‘g’ it renders the word as sang raal , which means “Royal Blood” in Old French. 6 From this perspective, the Holy Grail is not a simple carpenter’s cup. It is the children of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, the royal bloodline of Israel. The offspring of this royal bloodline spawned the Merovingian dynasty that ruled"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 3 France from 476 to 750 AD. For those who subscribe to this belief, the search for the Holy Grail ends in the royal houses of Europe. The theory that Jesus survived the Crucifixion combined with the notion that he had children formulate the core of the Grail heresy. Though I’m not sure I was convinced of everything in Holy Blood, Holy Grail – I later learned the author’s took poetic license with one of their key facts – I was convinced that large portions of the evidence they presented upheld this heresy. I was hooked. Rennes-le-Chateau and the mysteries of Jesus and Mary Magdalene became a subject of a now decades long fascination for me. Rennes-le-Chateau is place of enormous intrigue. Simply, I have found no other place like it on Earth. Tucked away in the shadows of the snow-capped peaks of the Pyrenees in the rugged wine country of Southern France, Rennes is one of the most mysterious parts of France and all of Europe. The air of this place is vibrant with secrets. Rennes-le-Chateau is approximately twenty-five miles ‘as the heron flies’ from Carcassonne. The many natural and man- made landmarks including castles, chateaus and mountains that form the backdrop for this historic landscape, quickly mesmerized me as I travelled along the Aude river valley road D118 through Limoux headed for Rennes to investigate the Grail heresy. A hundred years or so ago Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the narrow straight away from Carcassonne built. He planted trees to shade his troops as they sped along. The further one drives the more one sees vibrant people of all ages fishing, hiking, climbing, canoeing, and biking."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 4 There’s only one word to describe the people of Southern France and their home: it’s tres exhilarating ! LES POMMES BLEUES “A city that is set on hill cannot be hid”. Matthew 5:13 Strong word of mouth (and the stir caused by Holy Blood, Holy Grail ) has served as the powerful undertow which causes 20,000 people to make pilgrimages to Rennes each year, all seeking something of immense personal meaning. Rennes is not on tourist maps. Many of them arrive just as I had, wondering where the hell is the turn?! Somewhere down the road was the turn-off to the mountain top village. My only clue to its whereabouts was a sign for a restaurant called “Les Pommes Bleues” and the help of locals. Finally I entered the quaint town of Couiza, the village neighboring Rennes. Amidst the bakeries, cafes and markets there isn’t a single indication of a tourist information bureau. To make matters worse, the local shop owners were scurrying around, closing for their l-e-n-g-t-h-y lunch hour. The welfare of a wayward spiritual tourist was not on their mind. At times like this I wish I had learned to speak French, was connected to a global satellite positioning system, or, and especially, was in the company of mon amor, that scintillating, French-speaking, blond woman I missed at the frozen yogurt shop back in the USA."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 5 As my thoughts drifted to the two of us dirty dancing to Bruce Springsteen’s song In Gloria’s Eyes blaring on the car radio in a parking lot on a hot, moonlit mid-summer’s eve... Out of the blue a road sign that sat at the base to a steep mountain road screamed “Blue Apples!” over the blasting music in my mind. That’s the sign! I’m a true believer in two things: love and miracles. To me, finding that inconspicuous and weathered wooden sign was practically a miracle. I put my rental car in neutral parallel to the sign and marveled at its depiction of a hard guy-looking priest holding a light as if revealing a long-held holy secret. Beside him, big as day, were the holy words, ‘Les Pommes Bleues’: Blue Apples . The priest is Berenger Sauniere, “the mystery priest of Rennes.” The sign portrays him discovering a secret of immense value. We’ll become acquainted with him and his secret momentarily. I remembered the directions given to me by a colleague in the United States. “Go left at the Blue Apples sign and straight on till Rennes-le-Chateau.” The directions reminded me of those to Peter Pan’s Never Never Land, which is second to the right and straight on till morning. “Blue Apples” is the last line of a mysterious parchment that appeared at Rennes at the turn of the twentieth century. Since ancient times the apple has symbolized the science of immortality. Like Eve’s apple of knowledge of the Garden of Eden. But there’s no such thing as a blue apple, you say? Your’re right. Like the blue rose it is an alchemical symbol for the impossible. 7"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 6 At Rennes the French said forget about apples, we’ll symbolize this secret knowledge by a cluster of our large, beautiful grapes, or Blue Apples . Actually, the French word pommes comes from op om , the Sun Ball. 8 The English apple , says Webster’s Dictionary , 9 also means eye, stone or anything round. Rolling these definitions together reveals that the Blue Apples can refer to the ‘Blue Eye of the Sun’. It could also refer to ‘Blue Stones’. I slid my car into gear and began the slow, serpentine crawl up the steep mountain road to Rennes. The enchanted countryside spread out before me reminded me of a fairy tale kingdom. In the distance I could see the splendid ruins of Coustassa, a Knights Templar castle. The Templar were formed in 1100 AD. Among their earliest purposes was the recovery of the treasure hidden within the tunnels under the Temple of Solomon. 10 These ‘Knights of Christ’ are also reputed to have guarded the secrets of Jesus. 11 I felt the Templar history as if it were alive all around me. Any second I expected to see Templar knights on hard-charging big white horses emerging from a hyper-reality wearing their trademark white tunics with red crosses. I continued to ascend the twisting pathway to Rennes. If taken at great speed the turns could be stomach lurching. So, I crept along. Legend and scientific proof hint humans have been hiking up this hill and stashing the white-hot secrets of the ages here ever since the Stone Age. The Celts and Druids, followed in succession by the Visigoths, Romans, Christians, Cathars, Knights Templar, Troubadours and Nazis came and left."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 7 Even the Egyptians are implicated in this mystery. Billions of dollars in gold, priceless ancient documents, the secrets of the gods, the bones of Jesus, 12 the library of Jesus, all are thought to be buried in these shifting sands. Rennes-le-Chateau is a mystery wonderland because of the prospect of these and other mysteries. Illustrious men of genius such as Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, and Jules Verne have come and left this stage sharing company with such illustrious mystic titans as the 17th century painter Nicolas Poussin, Voltaire, Richard Wagner and Claude Debussy. 14 All came to Rennes seeking her light. All left clues as to the real secret treasure of Rennes-le- Chateau: the secret of the Blue Apples. Where there are apples in myths there’s usually serpents or dragons. The Celts called Eve’s paradise Avalon, or Apple- land, the land across the western sea where heroes and gods fed on the apples of immortality. The famous winged serpent or flying dragon that many heroes of yore have sought to slay guarded these apples. The power the secret Rennese conceals may explain why darkness does a thriving business here, too. This tiny village has dark elements of top secret U.S. military installations such as Area 51, Nevada; Pine Gap, Australia; Los Alamos, New Mexico; Michael Air Force Base, Utah; and the basement of the Vatican all rolled into one. The day before I arrived three C-130 military aircraft circled Rennes for three hours at 1,500 feet. What were they doing there? What were they looking for? Looming large over this terrain is lore thick with superstition, thieves and even evil. If you believe half of this propaganda you probably ought to be institutionalized."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 8 On the other hand, if you believe and discover the other half of the Rennes mystery lode, you might just join the immortals. Certain religious and political authorities would prefer that whatever esoteric tidbits are hidden at Rennes never see the light of day. These authorities aggressively protect this desire. For once the secret of Rennes is revealed, say the legends, it will wreak hell on the existing world order. That is why this sandbox is usually covered with deep (shark-infested) water, and why its secrert wisdom is so closely watched. PARTING THE WATERS Before further exploring the potential nature of this wisdom I’d like to divert this stream of consciousness for a moment to discuss one of its most important metaphors: water. Water has always been a big word and a big mystery to me. Ever since I was a kid growing up near Detroit, Michigan I have always loved big mysteries. The incredible ability water has to conceal and protect mysteries has always puzzled me. My determined fascination with water started when my parents took me and my (beautiful!) sisters to Bar Harbor, Maine for a vacation. We arrived at night. In the morning, I could see our hotel room overlooked the bay and the tall ships that had gathered for a Fourth of July festival. I crouched in the sand bar outside our room mesmerized by the shells and the assorted beach creatures. When we returned that afternoon the tide had come in and covered everything up! I was in shock. This was my"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 9 first experience with the concept of high tide and low tide, and with our planet’s interaction with the moon. When I was twelve, my dad owned an interest in a salvage company that salvaged sunken ships on the Great Lakes of Michigan. On summer weekends he’d cut me loose with his diving team of frog men and former Navy SEALs searching for sunken galleons laden with treasure. (That’s a bit romantic. Actually we hauled steel and copper ingots off of sunken freighters). These early water lessons would become immensely valuable to me when I grew up. In my twenties I designed and produced subliminal self-help audio tapes with disguised positive messages. The messages were embedded beneath surface sounds so as to arouse and attract the attention of the subconscious mind and allow them to sail past the censorship of the conscious mind. The most effective sound for disguising these messages, we learned, was the sound of ocean waves gently crashing on a shore. Later, when I became an investigative mythologist and began exploring the deep waters of wisdom of esoteric mythology, I encountered a similar concealment technique. I learned that ‘water’ was frequently used as a literary scarecrow device to protect ancient mystic secrets (including those of Rennes-le-Chateau). A good analogy of how this literary concealment process works is revealed in the burial practices of the ancients. 15 It was customary to bury kings surrounded by their royal treasures in secret chambers concealed below riverbeds. The process begins with damming the river, diverting its course, and then excavating and preparing the burial chamber. Then, with the dead king and his treasures safely tucked away,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 10 the chamber would be sealed, and the river released. In seconds a transparent wall of water would protect the treasure for eternity. The only way to recover the treasure would be to part the river once more. (That is, unless a secret passage was built into the chamber.) The original manuscripts of William Shakespeare were believed to have been concealed in a similar underwater vault in the Wye River in southeast Wales. Shakespeare himself -- or Sir Francis Bacon -- wrote of a king buried beneath the River Soar in England. Myths and stories conceal wisdom-bearing secrets in a similar manner to the way the ancients buried their kings. Stories and myths act like water to conceal and protect hidden secrets below. Most of the biblical stories, for example, are merely the ‘water’ that covers and protects hidden, esoteric truths that only the most determined seekers discover. As Moses and Jesus knew, ‘stilling the waves’ or ‘parting’ or ‘walking upon’ the waters of myth enable us to cross over to get to the other side -- the land of immortality. These ‘waters of life’, the primal waters of cosmic energy, are the waters of wisdom (the Holy Light) which separate the mortals from the immortals. In seeking this Holy Light my goal is to cross the real ‘Great Lake’ and join the great story- tellers on the other side. I have made it my business to seek and understand ancient tales of men (and women): • who crossed or poured out this water (as did the Sumerian goddess Mari/Inanna), • who watched over these waters (as did Osiris), • who sailed these waters (as did the Sumerian god E.A.), • who walked on this water (as did Jesus and the Mayan Peacemaker Quetzalcoatl),"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 11 • who parted this water (as did Moses and Alexander the Great), • who were destroyed by this water (as was Atlantis), • who were saved from drowning in this water (as was the Iroquois Peacemaker Deganawidah), • who flew through this water in a resurrection machine (like Elijah’s Whirlwind), • or bore through it via stargates or wormholes (which legends claim the mysterious beings we’ll talk about momentarily did). One thing I know, these ‘waters’ are the same as those which conceal the mysteries at Rennes-le-Chateau. They are not necessarily those you drink (although they may be). They are the living waters, the waters of immortality prophesied to appear in our time by the prophet Isaiah who said “the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” 16 The person responsible for diverting these waters to Rennes was Jesus and Mary Magdalene, his chief apostle and spiritual partner. (Incidentally Mary’s name comes through the Latin mare , meaning ‘sea’.) THE LIGHTNING ROD In the Grail tradition, Mary emerges as a lightning rod of brilliant, focused, religio-political thought and action who had little resemblance to the diminutive and repentant prostitute portrayed by the Church. She constantly questioned Jesus, as if she were checking his work, and was the benefactor of his most advanced and secretive scientific teachings concerning the universe."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 12 One of the tenets of the Grail heresy holds that the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene was a dynastic union between a son of the royal House of David, and a royal daughter of the Benjaminites, one of the original twelve tribes of Jacob/Israel. Their union was intended to solidify the political aspirations of these two families. Mary and Jesus’ children (twin boys, one of whom became St. John of the Light, or a girl named Sarah, depending up the story) assured its future. Upon his death, it is believed Jesus gave his personal possessions and most secret oral teachings to his ‘apostle of the apostles’, Mary Magdalene, who secreted them away to await the return of their owner. The exact nature of these secrets is unknown. However, the Knights Templar may have provided a vital clue. The Languedoc region -- which stretches from Provence to the eastern Pyrenees and includes Rennes -- was home to the highest concentration of Knights Templar in Europe. The ruins of their castles and commanderies haunt this land. Many believe the secrets of Solomon’s Temple are to be found in the Languedoc. In their book In Search of the Holy Grail and the Precious Blood , 18 Ean and Deike Begg tell of the bizarre graffiti found in the chateau at Domme, France, where Knights Templar were imprisoned after the persecution by the Catholic Church in 1307. Here is found a depiction of the Crucifixion that is slightly twisted from the accepted Church version (or the Church version is twisted from the original event). Joseph of Arimathea (Jesus’ wealthy uncle) is shown catching precious droplets of Jesus’ (royal blue) blood (presumably with the Holy Grail)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 13 On Jesus’ left is a pregnant woman holding a wand or a rod. According to the Gnostic legends, and early Christian art (see p. 18), Jesus possessed the Egyptian ankh or Key of Life (Light). This is both an advanced technology, a Rod of Miracles which once belonged to Moses, and a spiritual teaching which enables one to raise their spiritual bandwidth to master this technology. The myths I accumulated in my book The Peacemaker and the Key of Life 19 record that the Key of Life may be used to transfer souls from one dimension to another, level mountains, control natural phenomena, and for healing. In this work I will show it is also the key piece to opening ancient stargates. The Key of Life was also present at the Crucifixion of Jesus. We know this because the Key of Life was made from a branch that grew on the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden. According to medieval Christian legend, Adam was buried on Golgotha (‘the Skull’). 20 His son Seth returned to the Garden of Eden to retrieve a branch from the Tree of Life. He planted it on Golgotha where it grew into Christ’s Cross, the Tree of Crucifixion. Before the Flood Noah dug up the Tree for safekeeping in the Ark. After the Flood, he buried Adam’s skull under Mount Cavalry, where Jesus was later Crucified. The knowledge of the branch or Key of Life was handed down through the line of Shem, son of Noah, from generation to generation, until it reached Abraham, Jesus’ ancestor. Abraham’s great-grandson Joseph brought it with him to Egypt where he rose to highest rank in the Pharaoh’s court. There, the Key of Life remained among the treasures of the Egyptian kings until it passed to the hands of Moses."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 14 According to Exodus, 21 after his conversation with God in the midst of the burning bush Yahweh himself taught Moses to ‘make’ (a police term for ‘identify’) his Rod of Miracles which was able to bring water (wisdom) out of (s)tone 22 and part the waters of the Red Sea (the blood). 23 After failing to properly glorify God the second time he struck the rock, Moses was barred from the Promised Land. 24 He planted the Rod (and presumably the Grail Pillar) in the hills of Moab, near Jerusalem.

It is quite apparent from the connection between these names and the continuity of the depictions of Thoth, Akhenaton and Jesus above that the secrets of Peace (the Grail/immortality) had something to do with music (tones or keys). It also suggests Jesus perpetuated the Egyptian teaching of not only Moses, but also Thoth and Akhenaton. Aton is a word play for a tone or a tune . Interestingly, when, in the Bible, Zecharia prophesies that the Lord will be carried into Jerusalem on an ass he uses the word ATHON , so close to ATON . In Hebrew the male ass is called the hamor (‘H-AMOR’), the she-ass ATHON. 28 It would make a staggering difference if the Hebrew scribes, fond as they were of word play, used the word athon as a pun for Aton or a tone, the Key of Life. Was the Templar grafitti on the cave walls at Domme indicating that Mary Magadalene brought the Key of Life to France? A cipher found at Rennes says that Mary Magdalene holds ‘the Key Piece’. Is this the Key of Peace or the Key of Life? Is the Rod of God or the Key of Life of the Peacemaker at Rennes?

AMOR The frequent switchbacks and the severe pitch of the road made the drive up the steep hill to Rennes a bit of a challenge. Before I knew it, after all those years since college, I was finally in Rennes-le-Chateau. It felt like entering a fairy tale village complete with water tank and cozy stone cottages. There was even the kirk-kur-kur of a cock, the bird of dawn. It was showtime! I crawled around the tiny streets in my car (which seemed totally out of place here). I passed a bookstore (which got my heart thumping), the restaurant Les Pommes Bleues, which happened to be out of business (not exactly a good sign), and a few stone doll house cottages. I could live happily ever after with mon amor in one of these, I thought to myself. I parked the car in a central guest parking area. Stepping out of the car I left the dawning of the age of Aquarius behind and transposed into an earlier and simpler time. Delicious wood smoke puffing from multiple chimneys and the erotic odor of fresh-baked bread filled the air: an eerie quiet too.

No picture in any book, or even my wildest hallucination, could have prepared me for the breathtaking beauty of la val dieu (‘the valley of God’) spread out before me, its vastness cut by patches of small gardens and fields of grass gently blowing in the wind. To my right only a couple of feet away way was the bizarre neogothic tower I had fantasized about duplicating on the sheer cliff overlooking the lake at my home.

Feverishly, I strode to it. The mid-day sun had baked it warm. My palms absorbed the energy radiating from the tower. Oh, God! I felt my first Rennes epiphany. La Tour Magdala was named after Magdala the hometown of Mary Magdalene. It was completed in 1905 by Berenger Sauniere, the mystery priest of Rennes, on the sight of an earlier building which, according legend, had exploded into the skies in the fourteenth century, long before the first recorded use of gun powder in the west. In front of me was a strangely level mountain across the valley. Funny, I’d never seen pictures of that mountain in books. Down a narrow path the runs beside the Tour Magdala I found the Holy of Holies of my search: the Church of Mary Magdalene. Dedicated to Mary Magdalene in 1059, the church at Rennes was built on foundations said to have been laid by the Aryan Visigoths c. 410 AD. 1 However, there is evidence that they built on much more ancient foundations. A clue to its earlier builders is given in the ancient name for this site: the Temple of Isis, the Egyptian goddess of the elements. The strangely level mountain top across the valley is called the Temple of Osiris, after her mate. The combination of its ancient and modern history holds the key to the secret of the Blue Apples."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 23 Isis The short version of the modern mystery of the Church of Mary Magdalene has it that one day in 1891 while making repairs on the badly decaying church altar, a dirt poor Catholic priest name Berengere Sauniere allegedly discovered a cache of ancient parchments concealed in wooden tubes. Two of these parchments are said to be comprised of genealogies, one dating from 1244, the other from 1644. 2 The other two were composed in the 1780’s by the Abbe Antoine Bigou, one of Sauniere’s predecessors as the parish priest of Rennes-le-Chateau. 3 In January, 1781, on the eve of the French Revolution, Lady Hautpoul, owner of the chateau and trustee of the Rennes secret was dying. Having no sons to bequeath her secret to, she decided to confide her family’s past history, its secret, and some top-secret papers containing white-hot secrets, to her confessor the abbe Antoine Bigou. 4 On January 17, 1781 the lady Hautpoul died, but not before asking abbe Bigou to pass along the Rennes secret to someone who would preserve it.

Then he turned a large 8 th century slab set in front of the altar of the Church, the “ Dalle des Chevaliers ,” face down. 7 The “Dalle des Chevaliers,” the Knight’s Gravestone depicts two scenes, both of which involve an arch or a gateway . The first is a knight on a horse sounding a horn or tone while his horse drinks water from a trough. The second shows the same knight, this time with a staff in his hand, and a child.

Among these parchments was one we’ll look at in detail momentarily, which I call the Blue Apples Parchment. It should be stated that these parchments have never since seen the light of day. Copies abound however the originals are missing. There is enormous controversy over the alleged ancient pedigree and authenticity of these parchments. Some claim they’re not ancient at all. Rather they’re the modern work of the mother of all secret societies, the Priory of Sion, whose earliest members are reputed to have founded the Knights Templar. 10 Whatever their source or age, the parchments remain remarkably instructive. In fact, the content of these parchments is breathtaking in their possible meaning. The first parchment, what I’ll refer to as the SION Parchment, tells of Jesus and his disciples exploring a cornfield on the Sabbath. The story has been pulled together from three separate sources; Matthew 12:1-8, Mark 2:23-28, and Luke 6:1-5. Closer inspection reveals that this parchment contains a cipher which contains the message: TO DAGOBERT II KING"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 27 AND TO SION BELONGS THIS TREASURE AND HE IS THERE DEAD. 11 This cipher has been used by many seekers to pry open the Rennes mystery, in particular the connection with the Priory of Sion. For others, this message also revealed a treasure map. It is of immense interest to those seeking gold and other treasure in the area of Rennes. The strange arrangement of its letters concealed also a sacred geometry whose decoding ultimately revealed the existence of a twenty square mile pentagrammal temple as a landscape feature of Rennes to Henry Lincoln 12 and to mathematician David Wood 13 for one example. It also revealed the alleged location of the Tomb of Jesus to Richard Andrews and Paul Schellenberger (authors of The Tomb of God ) 14 for another. The second parchment I call the Blue Apples parchment. “What the hell did they think they were doing when they wrote this parchment?” I asked myself over and over while looking at the cipher. It looked Greek to me. Actually it’s an archaic Latin text, an excerpt from New Testament stories of Jesus. The Blue Apples Parchment begins with the word ‘jesus’. It tells the New Testament story of Jesus having dinner (with wine I presume) in Bethany with Lazarus and Mary Magdalene. Sprinkled throughout this parchment are a number of extra letters that form the basis for a coded message.

Then, the decipherer had to make a series of Knight moves. 16 On a chessboard a Knight moves in ‘L’ shapes. This made me think of the directions to Never-Never Land: “second to the right (two chessboard squares to the right) and straight on till morning.” The proper moves revealed a strange message provided by de Sede. The literal translations into English of this message vary. However, they approximate the following message: SHEPHERDESS NO TEMPTATION TO WHICH POUSSIN AND TENIERS KEEP THE KEY PIECE 681 WITH THE CROSS AND THIS HORSE OF GOD I COMPLETE OR DESTROY THIS DEMON GUARDIAN AT MIDDAY BLUE APPLES Silly doodling?

It contains the most profound secrets of the Jesus, the means to open a gateway to the land of Amor. The Blue Apples symbolize these secrets. An answer for why the Blue Apples symbolize these secrets comes from Harold Bayley who made a massive study of the history of European paper manufacture. He also began collecting the earliest watermarks, which he published in his book The Secret Language of Symbolism . 17 Bayley concluded that, after their persecution by the Church, the Cathars and other residents of the Languedoc region were among the earliest paper makers of the Middle Ages. Their watermarks, he says, are nearly all symbols of religious nature, the total comprising a secret language shared by those ‘in the know’. One of their most important marks was that of the Grail. Frequently it was shown as a vessel with a cluster of grapes or Blue Apples. From this we may conclude that the Blue Apples are interchangeable with the Holy Grail. After exploring the secrets of the Holy Grail for the better part of ten years, I focused on the Grail in its esoteric sense. In addition to being a ‘hardware’ container or device, I viewed it as a mysterious body of spiritual teachings, the ‘software’ for making it work. The key to elucidating Jesus’ secret teaching concerning the Grail is to remember that, in esoteric terms, alchemists know the Holy Grail as the ‘Stone of God’. 18 It is equated with the Philosopher’s Stone of Immortality. 19 (Some believe its secrets -- which enable the transmutation of the elements -- are literally written on a stone.)"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 30 I had long believed the Stone of God was actually a (S)tone or a tone of healing. It is a chord (or cord) that links man and God. In other words, the Key of Life and the Key (S)tone or Holy Grail are the same thing as the Blue Apples or Blue (S)tones of Rennes. PARIS Upon their discovery Sauniere showed the parchments to Henry Boudet, the abbe at nearby Rennes-le-Bain. Abbe Boudet is described in The Rennes Visitor’s Guide as a “highly cultured and erudite man, especially in the fields of archaeology and ancient languages.” 20 Many consider Boudet the real brains behind the Rennes story. Sauniere was his assistant. Boudet suggested to Sauniere that he visit his superior, the bishop of Carcassonne. 21 Upon reviewing the parchments, the bishop immediately dispatched Sauniere on an all expenses paid trip to Paris. 22 During his three weeks there Sauniere turned the parchments over to Church palaeographic experts and decoders of medieval writings. Specifically, Sauniere allegedly offered his story to the mystery men of St. Sulpice in Paris, the center of occult study for the Catholic Church in France that was built on the foundations of a temple of Isis in 1645. 23 What did the masterminds of this sanctuary discover?

Also, Sauniere went to work tearing the Church of Mary Magdalene apart for further clues, including some strange activities in the graveyard of the Church. No one is certain what Sauniere discovered when he parted the waters of Rennes. Whatever it was it accounted for the source of his wealth. The Church wrote nasty letters to Sauniere accusing him of simony (the selling of pardons). 26 The Church wished for the world to know Sauniere as nothing more than the pioneer of the modern-day televangelists whose mail-order religion is pure fraud. Of course, this charge trivializes the secrets of Rennes-le- Chateau. The Rennes mystery lives without Sauniere. Along with his friend and comrade, Henry Boudet, he devised a plan to preserve this mystery and encode its secret. EGYPT Perhaps taking a cue from the pyramid builders who etched the sacred wisdom of ancient Egypt on the limestone casing stones of the Great Pyramid, or the Egyptian scribes who encoded the Pyramid Texts (hieroglyphic writings on the walls of the temples at Heliopolis which contain the instructions for rebirth of the Pharaohs) on ancient temple walls, or possibly even King Solomon, Boudet and Sauniere concealed the instruction manual for the Rennes mystery within the Church of Mary Magdalene."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 32 The ancient name for this site: the Temple of Isis, suggests that it is best studied in parallel to Egyptian Mother Earth cults known as Black (meaning ‘hidden’) Madonna or Isis cults that are prevalent in the Languedoc. In France the ‘Madonna’ is not the Virgin Mary. Mary Magdalene, the bearer of Jesus’ children (the Holy Grail) is the Madonna. The word Madonna brings clarity to the connection between Jesus and Egypt. Madonna is composed of the elements M ( mem is ‘water’) and adon. Earlier we noted that adon means lord and is derived from the Egyptian word aton , the sun disk channeled by the Key of Life. Substituting the ‘d’ and the ‘t’ Ma d onna is M-a t onna or M of ATON, the waters or Key of Life. Allowing for this substitution, the Madonna cult is the cult of the Key of Life. If the Key of Life is the same as the Grail, then the M or waters of life of ATON is the same as the Blue Apples. The Blue Apples must be what is being channeled through the Key of Life into the nostrils of Isis in the depiction on page 16. The question is, what, exactly , are the Blue Apples? The answer may be found in Egypt. Hints of the Egyptian mysteries are everywhere evident at Rennes. A nearby mountain is called Seribouru or Sabaru. A statue of Isis was found nearby in the 1800’s. The river Sals, which sounds similar to the river Sais in Egypt, runs through Rennes-les-Bains the twin village of Rennes-le-Chateau. There’s even a local village called Luc Sur, Aude (phonetically similar to Luxor in Egypt).

The word Egypt cloaks a confusing mess of meanings: black land, land of the moon, land of alchemy, land of transmutation. There is a definite connection between Rennes-le-Chateau and Egypt. The original name for Egypt was Ta-Mari , which means ‘Mother Love’. 28 The Cathars of the Languedoc (whom we will meet again momentarily) claimed they possessed the secret gospel of Jesus called the Gospel of Love . They called the land of the immortals AMOR , love. They said Jesus came from this place. 29 He had come to lead his sheep out of Earth or ROMA (the mirror image of AMOR). This book was the foundation of the Church of Love. It is equated with the Grail. This secret manuscript is attributed to Jesus who gave it to John the Divine. The existence of the Book was revealed when the Church subjected the Cathars to torture. Its contents were said to transform ordinary men into supermen, or Homo sapiens into Homo Christos . Its power was such that it could cause all hatred, all anger, and all jealousy to vanish from the hearts of men.

The Buddhists called this realm ‘the Pure Land’. The Christians and Hebrews called it ‘the Promised Land’. In addition, the Cathars were concerned with the transmutation of matter, the transforming of the elements from one form to another. The land of AMOR is said to be far more beautiful than can possibly be imagined on Earth. Upon awakening from a possible dream journey to this place, Jacob, an Old Testament ancestor of Jesus, looked around him and exclaimed, “Terrible is this place!” In comparison to AMOR, “Earth is ugly!” 29 Is it just me, or after we do the mythological math, does ‘Egypt/Amor’ sound like a spiritual place that might have deeply interested Jesus? Do the activities that went on there, i.e. alchemy and transmutation, have anything to do with that mystery of all mysteries, the Holy Grail and the Blue Apples? Yes they do. Furthermore, they pertain not only to Jacob’s experience with the ladder reaching into heaven, but to the Crucifixion since the Grail was present at both the Last Supper, where the Grail secrets were revealed, and the Crucifxion, where the results of these secrets were retrieved. We shall unravel more of this perplexing Egypt/Amor- Grail-Crucifixion-Rennes connection momentarily. First, let us continue to follow the trail of Berenger Sauniere and the clues to the Blue Apples this reveals.

Unfortunately, she suffered a massive stroke which left her mute and paralyzed, and therefore unable to communicate her secret. 32 After the inauguration of the Church in 1905, Sauniere embarked on major construction projects throughout the mountain top village. While Albert Einstein toiled at his day job at the Swiss patent office discovering the theory of relativity, and Nikola Tesla was attempting to build a stargate, and Edison was trying to construct a machine for communicating with the dead, and Tesla’s former assistant Marconi was intercepting messages from Mars (or so he thought), Sauniere built: • the Tower Magdala, the neogothic tower that housed a portion of his immense book collection. • a spectacular Mediterranean-style house called the Villa Bethania. • a semi-circular belvedere which hugged the side of the cliff with a second tower at the end of it, crowned with a conservatory and loaded with thousands of books, • an orangerie • a park with fountains and a small zoo.

For instance, one shows a Scotsman in kilts observing the crucifixion. Another statue is of the Virgin Mary, with the word MISSION on the pedestal.

Another, even more powerful depiction, shows two thieves carrying an alive, but unconscious, Jesus from his buriel tomb under moonlight. Sauniere’s (or Boudet’s) brazen disregard (or merciless political incorrectness) reached its zenith when he installed a demon guardian at the front door ; a stooped figure with fiery blue eyes and sporting a green robe. This figure’s strangeness is so high he has the propensity for upsetting the apple cart of many Rennes visitors. In fact, many Catholics go ballistic at the mere sight of this devil. In 1996 one of the frantic faithful chopped off the poor guy’s head and absconded with it. Fortunately, for posterity’s sake, the head was soon recovered and glued back on the devil. This is the only known devil to be found inside a Catholic Church anywhere in the world. Many believe he is the devil for the fact that his head is horned. In the M-Istery tradition, however, the horns are rays of light, and were symbolic of the highest initiates. For example, Michaelangelo depicted Moses with horns. We know Moses was not the devil. Therefore, the possibility exists that this green-robed fella is not the Devil either. Devil or not devil, why is this figure here? Why is he wearing a green robe?

It spells out REX MUNDI – ‘King"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 37 of the World’. Rex Mundi was the name of the Devil of the Cathars. 33 “Cults can survive without a belief in God,” says Eric Hoffer, “but never without a belief in the Devil.” 34 As far as devils go, this one got around. The Buddhists also believe in the King of the World, a figure who lives in a paradise in the Inner Earth. Many people think he’s the same as the demon Rex Mundi. (We all know Rex Mundi as the source of the Rx found on our modern-day prescriptions.) If this is so, it appears the Buddhist (Eastern) and Christian (Western) religions converge at Rennes-le- Chateau. We will have more to say about this devil in the next chapter. In his pompousness Sauniere was not simply being ostentatious or spiritually incorrect. He had a brilliant plan. All of the above were Sauniere and Boudet’s objects d’art which attempt to conceal and convey what may be the secret of the Blue Apples. The idea was for people to come to Rennes (as they did in ancient Egypt) and read the church like a book... or even a riddle. The answer to the riddle, I believe, was placed above the entrance to the church where Sauniere placed the inscription “Terrible is This Place!” As noted, these are the exact words used by Jacob (c. 2000 B.C.) after his journey through the gate to heaven. The words which follow in Jacob’s quotation from Genesis 28:17 are: “This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate to heaven.” The combination of these three clues: the statues and paintings, the demon guardian, and the inscriptions, I am"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 38 convinced, reveal the secret of Rennes.

THE HOLY OF HOLIES Once inside the Church of Mary Magdalene, my first impression -- and I suspect most people’s -- is how small it is. And also that it’s dark. (It took this propeller-head two trips before he realized you’re supposed to put a few francs in the meter in order to turn on the lights.) In the light, the church is way over-decorated, almost confusing, demoralizing. Yet, the entire Rennes mystery, the secret of Jacob’s (or Jesus’) stargate, is believed to be condensed into this church and depicted within these walls. I felt like I had a strong understanding of it, until now. I looked around, bewildered. Before I knew it my fifteen minutes were up. I walked outside and sat beside the church, alone. Sauniere’s heady blend of political incorrectness and gaudy artistry would have to wait till the next hour struck one. With forty-five minutes to kill I walked about this storybook village on this unusually warm spring day. Stones crunched beneath my feet. Exploring a narrow alleyway, I came upon a silver-haired gentleman supervising repairs on his restaurant. “Come. Sit down,” the man said. He sat me on a chair and flicked me a sly glint. He was Rennes resident Jean Luc Stone, a scholarly gentleman with a"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 40 velvety voice and a contagious smile. “Just looking after a few repairs,” said Jean Luc shaking his head. “We had an earthquake a few months ago. This building’s been standing 700 hundred years. Now the French want me to put in these steel beams for reinforcement.” After years of living at Rennes Jean Luc is considered one of the foremost experts on the mystery that every year causes all those 20,000 pilgrims to flock here -- gold seekers, archaeologists, religious authorities, world-beating regimes, intelligence agents -- and turns them away feeling like they are further away from comprehending it than when they arrived. Hesitating to inform Jean Luc of my stargate dreams, I explained to him that I was in France on the trail of the Peacemaker, the forerunner or herald of the Christ or Messiah. I was also doing follow-up research on a few of the theories laid out in my book, The Peacemaker and the Key of Life . “You mean the Teacher of Righteousness or John the Baptist?” he asked, referring to the herald of Jesus. “Yeah,” I replied, surprised and impressed by his astuteness. Back home most Americans don’t pick up on the Peacemaker’s role so quickly. They’re usually too deep into the theology of the zealous Church’s commercial version of Jesus as the lone savior to read up on the historical Jesus. If they do, they think he’s the false prophet of the Anti-Christ. History reveals that much of what we have been taught about Jesus is flawed, inaccurate, and sometimes outright deceptive. When the original Nag Hammadi Scrolls came out of the ground in 1945 they struck the global mind with the force of an atom bomb. Like the early highly political Roman Church, many contemporary Christian leaders condemned"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 41 these books as ‘heretical’ for the forbidden secrets they held, most notably the relationship between the two saviors, Jesus and John (as well as the third, Mary Magdalene). In the Dead Sea Scrolls we started to get the clear picture of the cooperation between Jesus and John. We also learn a great deal about Mary Magdalene, who we learn, was not some mere porstitute who played a marginal role in Jesus’ life. She was his financier and was second to Jesus in command of the Jesus revolution. Further, she was his lover and his bridge to the world. We also learned the Essenes, who are widely believed to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls (though they may have simply copied them from earlier Egyptian texts) called themselves the ‘people of the pillar’. 2 They were anticipating the arrival of a teacher who would build a bridge to transfer their souls to heaven. They fancied themselves as contractors building a gateway of some sort. Hmmm, I wonder, what kind of gate could that be? INRI I followed Jean Luc inside his cottage. At the entrance I noticed a peculiar sign. It read “In ri.” The strange way the letters were spaced made it look like “In ri” was a hush-hush code name which could launch one into the holy of holies of some ancient wizard. “Jean Luc,” I asked, “why do you have the name of Jesus on the Cross on the outside of your cottage?” He turned and flipped me a look like I was a bit loony. “Jesus you say?” “Yeah,” I cringed. “Doesn’t INRI mean Jesus of Nazareth"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 42 King of the Jews?” I asked. In fact, this was the name Pontius Pilate nailed to the Cross above Jesus’ head. 3 “Oh, that. It’s supposed to say Ingrid, but the ‘g’ and the ‘d’ fell off.” “Oh, Christ,” I thought, embarrassed. Failure and humiliation, I had long since learned, are sometimes the most powerful teachers. Actually, Jesus scholars now question if Nazareth existed at the time Jesus was alive. This would mean INRI means something completely different. According to nineteenth century linguist Godfrey Higgins, “Nazareth, the town of Nazir, or the flower , was situated in Carmel , the vineyard or garden of God.” 4 Jesus was a flow-er; whence came the adoration, by the Rosicrucians, of the Rose and the Cross. Rose comes from Ras , meaning knowledge or wisdom. This flow-er (wisdom) was stolen from the Garden of Eden. When Jesus was Crucified upon this Cross he was literally the emblem of the Rosicrucians -- a Rose on a Cross. The Rosy-crucians, with their emblamatic red cross and red rose , may have originated from the fable of A-Don-Is, who was crucified (C- Rus -ified) and turned into a red rose by Venus, the Goddess of Love. Rus in Irish signifies a tree, knowledge, science . (A- Don once again links us with A-Ton.) Jesus, who was called Adon, and Mary Magdalene enacted these roles of Venus and Adonis. It is for this reason that in the wisdom tradition INRI means; “ By Fire Nature is Renewed Whole ,” pointing to Jesus’ role as a bringer of higher frequency knowledge or ‘fire’. 5 The Rosicrucians altered the meaning of INRI to IGNE NITRUM RORIS INVENITUR or “the baptism or cleansing power of dew is only discovered by fire.” 6"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 43 Remarkable insights into the true nature of the teachings of Jesus are to be gleaned when the word Nazareth is replaced by the alternative word Nazorean , the name for a religious sect of which Jesus was a member (but not the founder). In The Pentecost Revolution , noted New Testament scholar Hugh Schonfield observes that ‘Nazorean’ derives from Notstrim which means “Keepers or Preservers ... those who maintained the true teaching and tradition, or who cherished certain secrets which they did not divulge to others...” LOST HORIZON Immediately upon entering his cottage, Jean Luc showed me some of his hundreds of works of art he’s collected from his decades of travels around the world. Some of these objects were Egyptian. Usually, when one thinks of Egypt the colossal monuments come to mind. However, the tiny statues I held in my hand, some only about 3 inches tall, were just as powerful. Adjusting their perpsective from the really big to the really small is an underappreciated hallmark of the Egyptian mind. To me, this illustrates the concept of the microcosm and the macrocosm. The human body, is literally the bridge or link between the two infinities of the incredibly large and the incredibly small. On a clear night we can see billions of galaxies in the sky. Through a clear microscope we can see billions of molecules, each one comparable to a miniscule galaxy. As the bridge, we realize these are not two worlds, the incredibly large, and the incredibly small, they are One. Finally, we parked it on the couch in Jean Luc’s living room. On the table in front of me, he pointed to a tattered"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 44 paperback copy of Lost Horizon and then began talking about Rennes. My “pay attention, incoming message” sensors went haywire. Lost Horizon is the famous 1930’s novel by James Hilton about the lost sanctuary of Shangrila -- the Buddhist name for the paradisiacal home of Rex Mundi, the King of the World. Like some Christians, the Buddhist’s believe this figure will return to Earth as an ass-kicking savior in Delta Force garb who’ll wipe out the infidels and kick start a new Golden Age. With the rewriting of a few names Lost Horizon could be the story of Rennes: a hidden valley where a few achieve immortality or respite from an apocalypse. Then again, I sometimes have a tendency to read too much into things. As I pondered the Lost Horizon- Rennes connection, Jean Luc implored me to study the context of the Rennes mystery. He encouraged me not to look at it as an isolated island, but as a part of something grander. He also pointed to the Cathars as a vital part of the Rennes mystery. In the early 12th century the Cathars appeared in the Languedoc and Midi region. This group of souls called themselves Bonhommes or Good Christians, and ‘the pure ones’. They claimed they possessed the Book of Love (AMOR) the original initiatory and heretical version of the Book of John 8 (the only gospel the Cathars read) which likely contained the instruction manual for the Key of Life. This teaching, which could transform a human into an angel and once belonged to Abraham, Moses, and Solomon. I believe Jesus gave it to Mary Magdalene. The Languedoc takes its name from an ancient language, the Language of Oc , Old French for ‘yes’."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 45 I am plenty curious about this Language of Yes. One fact, in particular, informs us of the necessity of studying the Cathars and this Language. That is, the Cathars mandated that the Book of Love and the Gospel of Jesus be understood in this Language of Yes, which is different from Hebrew. By understanding the Language of Yes we will be able to apprehend the secrets of the Cathars. We may begin to understand the Cathar’s sacred language by exploring its curious name -- Oc . This is phonetically identical to Ak or Akka . The term Akadia or Arcadia has long been associated with the Rennes area. One of the parchments discovered there revealed the enigmatic message: “I am in Arcadia.” Pan, the devil in the Church of Mary Magdalene, is the King of Arcadian satyrs. Acca is identical to the Greek goddess Akka, ‘She Who Fashions’, the Mother Akka who brought the gods out of the deep (the cosmic ocean) and created humanity. 9 She was the same as the Akkadian Akka, the ‘Water-drawer’ who brought the gods to life including Sargon, the king of Akkad. The Romans called her Acca, and said she was a temple prostitute and one of the Vestal Virgins. According to Roman legend, Acca helped Rhea give birth to Romulus and Remus, the twin founders of Rome, who were drawn, Moses-like, out of their floating basket on the river Tiber. 10 The Egyptian Pharaohs were also masters of Akh , the Pharaonic word for all aspects of light, particularly the ‘transcendental’ light of the transfiguration. 11 The Greeks said Amon-Ra was the same as Pan. 12 It is more than likely that the illumination the Cathars received from Oc is related to the Pharaonic word for light, akh .

It is also used to designate the ‘third eye’, the uraeus , the fire- spitting serpent. 14 It is due to the ibis connection that I feel the Language of Yes is the same as the Language of the Birds. The Koran says this language gave Solomon wisdom and abundance of all things. 15 According to Lucy Lamey, in the Egyptian cosmogonic myths, akh (‘spirit’) is that aspect of our spirit, which conceives in advance what the object of creation, will be. 16 Akh emanates from a higher realm, ‘heaven’. The language of Akh is therefore the language of creation. Or as The Pyramid Texts say ‘ Akh is for heaven, kha (‘soul’) is for earth’. It is possible this heavenly language system was among the secrets recovered by the Templars from the ruins of the Temple of Solomon, who it is claimed, made the gold for his temple by alchemical means. The Pharaohs, Solomon and the Gnostics, however, are not the only source of information about the Language of Ak.

He descended into the body of Jesus at the baptism and left it again at or before the Crucfixion. The Gnostics were fond of word play. Take Nazarene for example. The words Naaseni and Nazarene are believed by some to have originated from nazar , meaning keep, guard, protect, and from naas or nahash , Hebrew for serpent. The Hebrew word for soul is nashamah .

The Vestal Virgins were married to the spirit of Rome by means of an artificial phallus in the Palladium shrine. 19 The Palladium originally belonged to Pan. It signified AMOR. 20 Stories say that not only did Chnoubis, or his Pillar, have the phenomenal ability to translate souls from one dimension to another, it could also drill holes in space, creating ‘halls’ or ‘doorways’ linking far-off regions of space to ‘wells’ on Earth! 21 Today, physicists call these ‘holes’ wormholes or stargates.

Plato said that if we could see the Earth from a far it would appear as a 12-angled pyramid, or a dodecahedron. In Gnostic tradition, Chnoubis is the guardain of this 12-angled pyramid that surrounds the Earth. 22 The Egyptian scribe of the gods Thoth first introduced the concept of the 12-angled Planetary Grid. He is also credited in Egyptian lore with the invention of magic and writing. Freemasons also say that Thoth possessed all secret knowledge on 36,535 scrolls that were hidden under the heavenly vault (the sky). 23 Thoth is described in the exact same terms as Chnoubis.

Alice lands in this “wonderland” after she falls down a ‘hole’ or pit while following a rabbit or hare. The Cathars had very specific ideas in regards to how to connect with AMOR, many of them in stark contrast to the Church of Rome. The Cathars believed that the key to making the AMOR connection is to understand the elements, the bread and wine, of the Eucharist and the Holy Grail. In Christian theology the doctrine of con substantiation states that the substance of the bread and wine of the Eucharist exist, after consecration by an official of the Church, side by side with the substance of the body and blood of Christ, but is not changed into it. 24 In other words, imagining the bread and wine are Christ’s body makes it so. In contrast, according to the Church of Love, eating the communion bread, representing eating the symbolic flesh of Christ, or drinking his blood (represented by the wine) is cannibalism. After all, if you think you are eating Christ’s flesh, you are. To the Cathars the bread and wine of the Eucharist represented a far more scientific teaching. Transubtantiation was the term used by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Eastern Churches to describe the Cathar’s transmutation of one element into another. 25 This secret, known to the Cathars as the consolomentum ( or cons-element-um ), was kept occult or hidden by the ‘Church within the Church’. The Cathars believed man enters the kingdom of God through his soul. To achieve this, he had to “ascèse” or ascend by detaching from the material world."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 52 The “ascèse” prepared him for baptism, Salvation was found through “consolament.” The fusing of soul ( kha ) and spirit ( akh ). This was the Cathars only sacrament. It signified a voluntary renunciation of the flesh and attachment to the things of this world. 26 Interestingly, the word ascend comes from asc or ask , or ascian , to call for, and scandere , to mount or climb. 27 The mountain the Cathars assiduously sought to discover through the Gospel of John and to climb was the Mount of Salvation topped by its Ladder to Heaven. The Church of Love differed from Rome in other ways. Rome maintains the bridge to Heaven is the Crucifix: a bloody Christ on the Cross. The Cathars rejected the ritual of the Mass and reviled the Crucifix as an instrument of torture, saying it was the symbol of Rex Mundi, and not the sign of Life. The way across to the Land of Amor was through the elements of the Eucharist transubstantiated into the blood of Christ within themselves . Transubstantiation comes from the Latin trans , across, and substantia , substance. This substance turned men into gods, as described by Jesus in his statement: “Is it not written in your law. I said ye are Gods.” 28 This substance -- the transmuted elements, caught by the Holy Grail -- took men across the waters of life to the Land of Amor. This substance, I believe, is the Blue Apples. As one can imagine, for an organization based on the idea that Jesus was the son of God who came to Earth and died for our sins on the Cross, and to be granted eternal life all one had to do is believe in Christ and pay homage to the pope’s priests each week, the teachings of the Cathars posed quite a threat to the fledgling Catholic Church."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 53 While the Church of Rome and the Church of Love used similar terminology -- the Eucharist, the transubstantiation, Communion -- they clearly meant different things by them. Unlike the Cathars, the Church or Rome clearly did not produce a substance that turned one into a higher being. Or, if it did, it told few about it. Another name for the Cathars was the ‘Albigensians’ (the white or pure ones). Notably, Al means God or All. Gen is the root of gene, as in DNA, Sian is phonetically Sion or sun. Condemned by the Council of Tours in 1163 as heretics, a propaganda war was launched by the Church against the Cathar’s competing ideology. Propaganda was not enough to dissuade the Cathars. The Church sought to neutralize the threat posed by them first by dispatching emissaries to debate and convert them. When its best envoys failed to convert these heretics of the Church of Love the Church of Rome called in the French gun- for-hire Simon de Montford to exterminate these people to guarantee its own survival and put forth itself as the only (blood-soaked) hand of God. From 1209-1249 the first European genocide was conducted against the Cathars by Pope Innocent III and a coalition force including French Catholics. Promising spiritual rewards in exchange for the blood of the Cathars, he sent 30,000 enforcers into the Midi and nearby Languedoc to eradicate the Church of Love. The first stop (and most bizarre episode) of this crusade occurred in the town of Beziers where 222 Cathars lived amongst a population of thousands of Catholics.

One local commentator writing in 1213 said they would rather ‘die as heretics than live as Christians’. On July 22, Mary Magdalene’s Feast Day, the Pope ordered the extermination of every man, woman and child within the city gates of Beziers. One crusader of conscience was said to have asked a superior how they were to tell Cathar from Catholic. The reply was direct and chilling: ‘Kill them all. God will know his own’. At dawn on that fateful summer morning, 7,000 women, children and elderly crowded themselves into the Church of Mary Magdalene for mass. It must have been difficult to hear the word of God over the sound of the Pope’s axes ripping apart the barred wooden door at the back of the church. After more then 700 years the grotesque sounds of swords and axes meeting flesh and bone still reverberate faintly in the ears of the sensitive. 20,000 people were slaughtered to help preserve the Church of Rome’s dominance that day. A hundred innocents were killed for every Cathar. 30 For the next forty years the Cathars were hunted, tortured, burned at the stake and savagely murdered by the Church’s hired killers. It used psychological warfare to turn Christian against Christian, neighbor against neighbor, and even brother against brother in a bloodthirsty campaign that continued with the Inquisition.

THE BOOK IN STONE After a half-hour of looking at Jean Luc’s pictures of Egypt, at 12:55 I left his cottage for the short walk to the Church of Mary Magdalene and its re-opening at 1:00. The walkway winds around a Garden of Calvary. Sauniere had visited the famous healing center at Lourdes (three hours away by car) in 1858 and was overwhelmed by the transfer of healing energy that took place there. He sought to bring that same experience to Rennes. So, outside the Church he constructed a Calvary. Shaped like a tetrahedron or a triangle, in the center of the Calvary he placed a cross with a large orb at its top, from which shot golden rays. Of course, this unique orb is long gone. Behind me I heard footsteps on the crunching stones. It was Jean Luc. “I forgot to mention,” Jean Luc shouted. “Look at the twins when you get inside the church.” Promptly at one o’clock the luckiest guy in the world finally appeared, he unlocked the door to the church for me without a word. Anyone who attempts to read this ‘book in stone’ from cover to cover will suffer from a stop-the-church-I-want-to- get-off vertigo. It is intended to be skimmed, grazed, absorbed subliminally like a library, Jean Luc had told me. “Turn on your antennas and feel the place, connect with"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 57 it,” his voice suggested. I sent out my psychic satellites and followed the admonition, “look at the twins.” My senses shifted to the front of the church to check out the paintings of Joseph and Mary, each on either side of the altar, each holding a twin boy. “That’s strange,” I thought to myself of the twins. Legend has it that Jesus had a twin brother, possibly Thomas (‘the twin’). Some think Leonardo da Vinci painted Jesus’ twin in his famous Last Supper painting. Da Vinci had been a past Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. I wondered if they had asked Sauniere to keep this ‘twin’ message alive here as well. In their fascinating book The Templar Revelation , 1 Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince point out that central to the overall composition of da Vinci’s painting is the shape that Jesus and a mysterious woman make together -- a giant, spread-eagled ‘M’. Is this woman Mary Magdalene? My muse keeps wanting me to put the I or pillar together with the M, though I’m not sure why. ‘M’ is the astrological sign for Virgo, the Virgin, who was originally Isis. Is the M a reference to the Mystery School of Isis? In the Hebrew alphabet the center letter is M. Mem stands for water , especially the water of the Mother. In the Irish language the Mem is called M-Vin. Vin in the prefix for vino, or wine. The M also represented the M-phalos or Omphalos, the concentrated Mother’s essence. 2 The Omphalos is also the navel-(s)tone, the Matrix, the Delphus (womb), the center of the Earth (where Jesus died on the exact spot where the Tree of Life once grew in the primordial garden). 3 Did Leonardo place the ‘M’ there as a reference to his profound knowledge of the M-Isteries of the Blue Apples?"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 58 As I pondered this question, suddenly, I had a revelation. That’s not Josesph and Mary depicted at the front of the Church. That’s Jesus and Mary Magdalene and their twin children. To my left was a statue of John the Baptist baptizing Jesus. Oddly, John is baptizing Jesus with a silvery cockle- shell rather than by total immersion in water. Consumer alert buzzers rang in my mind. And so too did a nursery rhyme: “Mary, Mary quite contrary, How does your garden grow? Silver bells and cockle-shells, And pretty maids all in a row.” The “pretty maids” are the Mer-Maids or Mari - Maids of lore, the half-human-half-fish wisdom beings of the Water-Mother Mari, whose singing made the music of the seven heavens. 4 This scene is utterly bizarre! Why is John baptizing Jesus with a silver shell instead of total immersion in water? What is the silver shell? Could it have something to do with the forbidden healing wisdom of the white metal ‘antimony’ the Fallen Angels taught humanity? Or, could it be palladium, the name of the Vestal’s Pillar of AMOR, which is also a silvery-white metal? Could this shell represent the magical quicksilver of the smiths or alchemists that turned lead (impure souls) into gold (pure souls)? Is John actually initiating Jesus in some form of secretive alchemical process which makes a garden (soul) grow? My analytic mind took over. Jesus crouches in the same position as the Devil, but inverted. Jesus stares at the chessboard. “Hmm,” I thought. Jesus and the Devil are mirror images of one another playing a game of chess.

The SION Parchment contains the two words ‘REDIS BLES’. 5 One of the old names of Rennes-le-Chateau is ‘Redis’ and ‘bles’ is French for ‘corn’. It is also a French slang term for gold. Is this the proverbial bag of gold at the end of the rainbow? The painting, called The Mountain of the Beatitudes (also known as Terrain Fleuri , “The Land of the Flowers”) a name which suggests a garden to me, shows the Mount of Beatitude where Jesus gave his famous Sermon on the Mount or his 8 spiritual blessings, the beatitudes. 1. Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 2. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 3. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 4.

Thoughts of what I might find there raced through my mind. That’s when the lights of the Church went out again. On my way out the door of the Church my focus shifted to the ugly ‘devil’ with the green robe standing at the doorway. He too was smaller than I imagined, only about four-foot tall. He is staring at the black and white tile paving on the floor of the church (similar to the checkerboard floors found in masonic temples.) When Sauniere was alive it had 64 squares, laid out like a chess-board and oriented on the four points of the compass. At one time, this ‘doorman’ in the green robe held a burning torch in his right hand. Putting a statue of the Devil in a church would pretty much be a career killer for most priests. Sauniere really shot himself in the foot when he put this guy here.

They are compared with the Sanskrit deva (shining one, god) and adeva (Devil), which became daeva (devil) in Persian. The Old English divell (devil) can be traced to the Roman derivative divus , divi : gods. This confusion may explain why the writers of the Old Testament didn’t particularly care for the Danites, whom they said would judge (balance) the people and were called Serpents by Jacob, 7 a title typically (and erroneously) reserved for Satan, whom the Egyptians called Sata , serpent. 8 According to Celtic/Druid legend, on Beltane or May Day, in a fog, the Tuatha De’ Danann came ‘through the air’ to Ireland to teach young men sacred wisdom.

That same poem refers to Amergin as “the Word of Science.” Per this agreement, the people of Daniel were required to leave the surface of the Earth and live in an underground kingdom accessed only through the sidh-mounds (pronounced “she”) or ‘hollow hills’ of Ireland.

They are considered to be direct descendents or reincarnations of the early gods of Sumeria, the Anu. 13 Wentz notes that these sidhe people are described as a race of majestic appearance and marvelous beauty, in form human, yet in nature divine. 14 They are divided into two classes: those which are shining, and those which are opalescent and seem lit up by a light within themselves. 15 The word sidh informs us of the nature of these forbidden teachings the Daniel had access to. Sidh appears to be related to the Latin sedes and the Sanskrit siddha , both words meaning power.

By adding a ‘y’ suffix to their name, a demonic or diminutive image was created. 18 The Church is understandably reluctant to admit this (just as the Japanese are sheepish about discussing their ancestors the Ainus -- the Children of Diana -- who were fair, tall and blond and came from the sky, left for the skies, and will return from the skies). 19 As they withdrew, the Tuatha de’ Danann prophesied that man would eventually destroy himself through lust and sin.

According to Budge, he was also both a smelter and a caster, and sculptor, as well as the master architect and designer of everything which exists in the world. 24 The Greeks and the Latins claimed Hephaistos and Vulcan as his later names. Hephaistos was an early smith god, cast down from the Olympian’s heaven by Zeus, for trying to protect his mother Hera (Earth). Like Asclepius, he was associated with lightning. 25 A lightning bolt from Zeus killed Asclepius because he was afraid that such a skillful physician could make all men immortal."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 74 The Staff of Asclepius shows a serpent wound around a staff.

Thus Ptah, the bird-man, is clothed in the feathers of the Truth of Maat. Those who lived by Maat took a sacramental drink, comparable to the Holy Grail, which conferred ritual purity. 28 Maat is probably Tiamat, one of the Pleiades.

The dove appeared in migration at the time of vintage, its purple-red breast like wine reminding the wine makers of their grapes. 29 Suddenly, the story of Jesus’ “curing” Mary Magdalene, his chief apostle, of “possession” by “seven demons” takes on New meaning. These seven demons may well be the seven stars of the Pleiades. His “curing” would therefore represent him mystically attuning her soul or telling her stories about the seven stars (or Blue Apples) of the Pleiades.

MARI Ptah’s distinctive outfit and accoutrements, including the All, is matched by another key ancient figure, the goddess Mari , another name for Isis. In 1933, French archaeologists digging at Mari on the Euphrates river in Syria made an astonishing discovery. Excavations led by Walter Andrae from 1903 to 1914 uncovered remains of the temple palace complex of Ishtar at Mari. 1 This complex had a ziggurat, temples of Ishtar, Ninharsag, Shamas (‘sun’) and Dagan (‘fish’), and a royal palace spread over six acres. The palace contained nearly 300 rooms, many of which housed palace administrators and thousands of diplomatic and administrative records. Mari was home to the goddess Mari, “Mother Love,” or the Queen of Heaven. This goddess was continually worshipped for over three thousand years (c. 3500 - 500 BC) in the ancient Near East. She was one of the three great goddesses of the Bronze Age, the others being Isis of Egypt and Cybele or Sabael of Anatolia, the Great Mother of the Gods from Ida. All three were incarnations of the Great Mother, the Lady of Life. Among her many names were Ishtar, Inanna, Astarte, Ma, Astoreth, the goddess worshipped by King Solomon."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 77 THE CITY OF LOVE ! Mari’s Amor -ite city or ‘City of Love’ of Mari was considered as one of the wonders of the ancient world. 2 It was the Holy Land or power center until it was conquered by the armies of Hammurabi in 1700 BC. The people of Mari believed that the universe was the property of a large pantheon of gods and goddesses who were human in form, but superhuman in their powers. They believed the goddess Mari lived in her temple on Earth. Among the numerous wall paintings and sculptures uncovered at Mari in Syria archaeologists discovered the jaw dropping 4,000 year-old three-dimensional, life-size statue of the goddess Mari below. Called simply The Goddess with a Vase , in this statue Mari is wearing a coat, a hat and other garments. She holds a water jar in her hands. Mari full-length coat is blue, the color of the sea. It is called the PALA garment or ‘ruler’s garment’. The component PALA is key. It is the root for palladium , Pala-to , palace and paladin , the name given to the knights of the Grail in medieval chivalry. Mari has a cluster of blue stones (apples?) gathered around her neck and throat area. The ‘hat’ is no ordinary helmet. It is called the Shugurra helmet. Whenever attempting to understand or explain The Goddess with a Vase statue, I turn to (and embellish on) Sumerian scholar and linguist Zecharia Sitchin.

The TET corresponds with the Menat worn by Ptah on the back of his head and with the TET pillar that is part of the All. These accoutrements underlined that this goddess was the Queen of Mari. According to Sitchin, no one has been able to explain the nature of Mari’s strange ensemble of coat, hat and other garments. It is too bizarre to think of it as some form of ancient virtual reality system that assists one in transforming themselves in order to go far into the universe. But what if that is what it is?

Among Mari’s many titles she was known as Ma-Ya , ‘the Lady of Life’, or Ma . 5 Her temple/womb/sheepfold was considered the vessel of Creation. With her Shugurra helmet snuggly fitting her head, Mari goes to her sheepfold, which is the center of nature of Sumer (or Su-Meru). Leaning against a fruit tree, she rejoices in her own natural powers -- her wondrous vulva. Within this temple emerged Mari’s son who was named ‘ Lord of the Sheephold ’, ‘the Shepherd’, ‘Lord of the Net’, and ‘Lord of Life’. 6 According to Sumerian legend, in a night of wild drink and sex, Inanna/Mari, a cunning and ruthless beauty, seduced the god E.A. and made off with his prized Key of Life, as well as the divine ME-tablets, the divine formulas which were the basis for high civilization. 7 That night she also conceived a son, Thoth. Mari’s name anticipates the Virgin Mary by 3,000 years. Both women had a son who died a violent, sacrificial death. Mari’s titles ‘Light of the World’, ‘Morning and Evening Star’, ‘Righteous Judge’, ‘Forgiver of Sins’, and ‘Holy Shepherdess’ were later given to Mary’s son, Jesus. Jesus said he had many sheepfolds. Among the beautiful treasures that were discovered at Mari were stone molds for cakes found in the kitchen of the palace in the shape of the Goddess’ body. The cakes eaten by the worshippers of the Queen, says scholars, 8 may have been a precursor of the Christian Eucharist the bread and water used at the Last Supper."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 81 The similarity between Mari’s son and Jesus are striking. Raised by priestesses in the Vessel of Creation, the half- human, half-divine son, who was called the Lord of the Net, appears to have been privileged to learn the secrets of the universe, including those of the Key of Life. In Matthew Jesus states the Kingdom of Heaven is a Net. 9 When he appears to John he is wearing the attire of the goddess including a floor-length garment and helmet white as wool. He also wields Key of Life in the form of the seven stars that he holds in his hand. 10 The creation of Mari’s son is also equivalent to the story of the creation of the Adam in the Hebrew story. The Sumerians are considered by many Old Testament scholars to have been the original authors of the creation myth as found in the Book of Genesis. The tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, particularly the Tree of Life incident, is also of Sumerian origin. According to Sumerian myth, Mari/Inanna rescued the Tree of Life from the world flood and planted it in her garden at Mari. This Tree was an axis connecting the underworld with Earth and the heavens. 11 Mari seeks to use the wood from the Tree to make a throne and a bed. However, she discovers that the Tree has some unexpected occupants. A serpent has “made his nest in the tree.” This serpent is not alone.

This sacred mountain became known was Fuji-Yama. From his throne Yama, as the ‘King of Righteousness’, sips on soma and gives judgment (or balances Heaven and Earth), much like Thoth. 15 In the Judeo-Christian religion Maya’s husband Yama, the serpent, became a figure the Hebrew scribes did not exactly know how to handle. When Moses asked God his name, God replied from the burning bush, “I am.” 16 He became known as Y-Am or I-Am, the Old Testament Hebrew god who was also known as Yahweh or Jehovah. The Pillar depicted in the Sumerian and Egyptian examples we will look at momentarily are symbolically equivalent to the Tree of Life of the Garden of Eden story. Ya-Ma or I Am is the name of the serpent that lived within it. Logically, the Old Testament Lord and the Serpent appear to be one. Despite the Lord’s injunction in Leviticus 26:1, “You shall make no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: For I am the Lord your God” the Hebrews continuously sought the Pillar, sometimes at the request of I-Am. In the Book of Numbers , chapter 21, I Am said to Moses, “ Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looks upon it shall live.

Jews and Christians later remembered this duo, combining their names Maya and Yama into one, Mari-Yama or Mariam, the name of the mother of Jesus. 18 In the Gospel of John Jesus speaks directly of this serpent, “ And as Moses lifted the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth may in Him have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son... ” 19 Let us now look at the Sumerian and Egyptian depictions of the Tree of Life. The TET box on the back of Mari’s helmet, which she wore when entering her sheepfold, appears to serve the same function as Ptah’s menat charm. It connected her to the TET pillar. Ptah sometimes appears standing in front of a TET pillar. In Egypt, the TET pillars were called “the backbone of Osiris.” In Egyptian mythology, Osiris is the green-faced savior god. He, along with his wife Isis, came from Sirius and taught the art of gardening. They were profusely illustrated in ancient Egypt.

Modern electrical engineers, physicists readily observe that the ancient Egyptian religious artwork portrays an object strikingly similar in design to a modern Van de Graaff Generator. Designed and built by American physicist Dr. Robert J. Van de Graaff, who was a professor at MIT, this generator was built in 1931 as a research tool in early atom-smashing and high energy X-ray experiments. The device that bears his name has the ability to produce extremely high voltages -- as high as 20 million volts .

Modern physicists readily notice that these pillars bear an uncanny resemblance to cathode ray tubes. Developed in the 1870’s by Sir William Crookes, an English physicist and"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 88 chemist, the tube was integral to the study of what came to be called cathode rays. Cathode-ray tubes are glass tubes with the air sucked out of them. Metal plates are sealed at either end and then connected to a battery or an induction coil. When charged with electricity, the vacant areas in the tubes glow. Crookes concluded that invisible rays from the cathode caused the glow. The glow emanated from the negative plate -- the cathode -- and disappeared into the positive plate -- the anode . Significantly, Cat-hode comes from the Greek kathodos, going down, from kata , meaning ‘down’ and hodos , way. Cata is also the root for Cat-har and Cat-holic , meaning ‘universal’. What are these “serpents”? The ancient linguist, poet, and holy man, King Solomon, might remind us that in Hebrew nahash is the word for serpent and wisdom. The Hebrew word for soul is neshamah . The linguistic and phonetic similarity of these words would force a question in Solomon’s poetic mind. Are the ancient Egyptian artists asking us to link these serpents with souls? “I TAWT I TAW A PUTTY TAT” The “patient” on the operating table beside the TET or TAT does appear ready to receive the contents of the tube or jar. The “doctor” holding the cutting knife has the head of a cat . Following our pattern of investigating word meanings, I find it fascinating that kathodos contains the element Os , or Osiris.

To the Egyptians this tree is also known as the persea tree. The tree is shaped like a spade, the tool of the gardener, and is accompanied by a cat, giving rise to the notion that it is a “pussy tree.” According to the story told by the priests at Heliopolis, Egypt, the cat is another form of Ra-A-tum , the name the Egyptians gave to the spark of life (the Akh ) that releases the infinite energies of Nun (creation). Why the cat? As noted, the Egyptians were fond of word play and puns. Electricity that spat and hissed and bit and numbed became depicted as a cat. In order to free itself from the serpent’s coils, A-tum (or A-tom) took the form of a cat and killed the serpent by splitting it with its knife. When the cat (atom) splits the serpent the persea tree emerges from within it. The cat’s persea tree can be treated a number of ways in the Language of the Birds. For example, what is the relation of the cat’s purr to the per- sea tree? What is the significance of the fact that Mary Magdalene is the patron saint of per fume? What significance, if any, is there to the fact that the Grail Stone is also known as the “ Pearl of Great Price”? Was a play on words intended when the Cat -hars called themselves the Pure or Purr Ones? In the hieroglyph of Osiris two ‘TET’ pillars are featured on either side a mysterious object that resembles the Hebrew Ark of the Covenant. Beside them is Osiris’ Pillar of Love (far right).

ROSTAU The ancient Egyptians called the complex where this procedure took place the Ros-tau . 20 This is another word for Giza. The Giza-Rostau complex was at the end of the ‘sacred road of the neters,’ suggesting it was a passageway used by the gods to enter the underworld (also called the Tuat).

This ‘ladder’ is a symbol of that which must be ascended in order to reach the Fields of Peace.

Then, suddenly, the “double doors of heaven open up... the aperture of the celestial windows is open.” And soaring as a great bird, the pharaoh’s Ka has reached the land of the living. A startling correspondence between the crucifixion of Jesus and the Pillar of Osiris is found in the definition of the Greek word stau-ros . While unfamilar to most modern Christians, it was the original Greek word used to describe the Cross upon which Jesus was crucified. It actually means the 'pillar'. The mirror image of this word is ros-tau , one Egyptian term for the Sphinx. The word “cross” did not appear in the Bible until after 500 AD. 21 This explains why the “Latin” (Roman) or “Passion” cross, the primary icon or logo of Christianity, did not appear in Christian art until 600 AD either. 22 In the original Greek version of the New Testament the word used for the Pillar upon which Jesus was Crucified was Stau-ros . In Egypt tau was another name for the ankh , the Cross of Life. Ros means wisdom and dew.

In Egyptian symbolism the phoenix is interchangeable with the heron. The heron (phonetically hare- on) was the symbol for the sun-bird-man, the savior figure, that landed atop the Persea Tree of Heliopolis or On at the dawn of each New Age. Heliopolis was the name of the city where Jesus was taken during the ‘flight to Egypt’. The heron was a title for Osiris. Budge says Osiris was also called Un-Nefer , a name that means ‘beautiful hare ’ or ‘good being’ . 23 He also says Un-nefer comes from un ‘to open, to appear, to make manifest’, and neferu ‘good things’ (a related word is neteru , or god-beings). Isis was known as the Great Goddess Har , the patroness of temple prostitutes or harines . 24 Like the Greek horae and other holy harlots , her priestesses occupied the part of the temple known as the Harem, the Sanctuary. In order to rule, kings had to prove their virility by impregnating the harines , creating a semi-divine offspring who were half-human, half- heron, i.e. bird-men or angels. The harines explain why Mary Magdalene was known as a harlot. It also provides an explantion for why the resurrection of Jesus, is associated with the Easter bunny.

The name for the Egyptian underworld was the Tuat . Sometimes Osiris was depicted with his body bent around backwards so as to form the Tuat. The Seven Hall of the Tuat are reminiscent of the Hindus legend of Fohat , a serpent who dug ‘holes in space’ . 26 These theorists tell us that ‘below’ the Earth are seven intermediate points or cavities: Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala, and Patala. This, in turn, rings of the Mayan legend of the ‘Seven Cities of Cibola’ (or Sa-Ba-La), which were the seven caves or holes of Aztlan, Atlan, or Tula. In one of these holes, Patala, dwells the Lord An-an-ta, the primeval Hindu god, intoxicating all with drops of fragrant honey from his fresh tulasi flower. THE TELI OR TULA In the above sentences we notice the repetition of the words talah and Tula . Talah means “to hang.” In the mysterious Jewish alchemical text, The Bahir, Teli (derived from talah ) is the name of the connecting link that will enable our soul to return to its home. 27 It is often described as a pillar or pole between Earth and Heaven. In Christian mythology this was the Tree of Death, or the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 96 Cross upon which Christ died. 27 In fact, both Christianity and Egyptian religion employ the tree in the contradictory terms of death and life. Jesus hung from the Tree of Death, the Cross, but in so doing became the Tree of Life. Other authorities identify the Teli with the “Pole Serpent” mentioned in the book of Job, “By His spirit, the heavens were calmed, His hand has pierced the Pole Serpent.” 28 This Pole Serpent is imagined as an imaginary creature from which the Earth hangs. From another perspective, where the Hebrew words for serpent and soul are interchangeable, the Teli may refer to a Pillar from which hangs a serpent- shaped soul sphere. This is exactly what the book of John 3:15 says, “ And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life .” The Greeks called the Milky Way’s Central Sun Tula (Sanskrit for ‘balance’). They were not the only ones to possess knowledge about Tula. The Druids said they came from Hyperboria. At the center of this heaven ‘beyond the north wind’ was Tula, the Druid mecca for learning. Whenever we see the T-L-A letter combination in a word or sprinkled throughout a word it is a reference to Tula. Like the Hebrew scribes, the Druid Bards were masters of word play and the mixing of word elements. Identifying the T- L-A elements of Tula embedded within key mythic names and place names helps us to uncover the sacred teachings of the galactic core hidden in many myths and religions.

The abbe and Heeren had noted the similarity between the Scriptures and Egyptian Mystery School teachings. In Egypt, they found the Ark of the Covenant, the cherubim with their extended wings, the holy candlesticks, the shew bread or Manna, and many other power tools revered by the Jews. He even noticed that the word used for the name of Thebes is exactly the same word as that used to describe the Ark of Noah. The same mythologies are being described. From this vantage point Heeren and the abbe de Rocher peered into the story of the Savior crucified in Egypt. The story begins with Abraham, whom the abbe finds in Egypt under the name Binothris or Ben-Terah , son of Terah (Abraham’s father’s name, which is the same as terra or Earth). A king named Tulis succeeded this Binothris or Abraham. The son of Terah (phonetically ‘terra’ or ‘terror’) is said to have established the first queen in Egypt, or to have first recognized females as royalty. This queen’s name was Sarah. The word Tulis means ravisher in the Hebrew and Arabic. Thus Tulis was the ravisher of Sarah. “The history of this Tulis, as given by Suidas, is very remarkable,” says Higgins. He quotes Suidas, “Thulis reigned over all Egypt, and his empire extended even over the ocean. He gave his name to one of its isles ( Ultima Thule ).” 32 Puffed up with success, he went to consult the oracle of Sarapis (known to the Egyptians as Asar-Hapis or Osiris-Apis ). He asked the oracle if there were any man greater than Thulis. The oracle replied that God, the Word, and the Holy Spirit are"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 101 more powerful. He then told Thulis to go away for he has an uncertain life. Immediately upon leaving the temple Thulis was put to death by his countrymen, the Egyptians. “But the most remarkable part of this story,” says Higgins “is that the word Tulis means crucified .” 33 Further, says Higgins, “Here in the country of the Africans -- in Egypt we have again the crucified of the Apocalypse. Thlui or Tula is the name given by the Jews to Jesus Christ, meaning the crucified .” 34 Jesus, the crucified, means Jesus of Tula? I realize Higgins’ statement may come as a shock for some. Some will say I am connecting unrelated words and stories. I don’t think so. I have given the basis for doing so, and have established Tula as the source of all myth and religion. So why not the myths of Jesus too? Fascinatingly, the Old Testament word for ‘virgin’ was ‘bethula’. Literally it means beth ‘house’ or ‘vessel’ of Tula. While on the subject of adding word meanings together, it is important to note that earlier we found that Elizabeth Van Buren said that Thule (Tula) means “black land.” This is another definition of the word ‘Egypt’. If, as Ms. Van Buren says, Rennes is Egypt, then Rennes and Egypt may also be Tulas.

What if it is not Jesus? Have you ever since a depiction of Jesus with his face painted green? If he is not Jesus, can we identify the Gardener? Yes. In the Islamic tradition, a highly revered mythological figure is shown wearing a shimmering green robe, and is the ‘Guardian of the Source of the Waters of Immortality’. He is called Al Khidr , the Green Man or the Evergreen One. The Islamic people believed Al Khidr was Elijah! 38 Didn’t Jesus say John the Baptist was the reincarnated Elijah? 39 If John is the Green Man, why didn’t the Gospels simply say so? Or, when they said the Gardener was there did they expect us to understand who they were talking about? If it is an intentional omission, why would the editors of the New Testament story of Jesus omit a crucial detail such as this? It is vital that we attempt to piece together Jesus’ story, for if the Gardener is the King of Tula it suggests that Jesus found some way to travel to this location in order to bring him back to Earth."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 103 My proposal is that the Crucifixion was a stargate event. The Shroud of Turin is the evidence. In the next chapter we will examine this piece of evidence. Before doing so, it is worthwhile to briefly consider the story of Alexander the Great ( c. 330 BC), another seeker of the secrets of immortality. ALEXANDER AND THE GARDENER ! Throughout his career Alexander summoned the power of the Green Man. He believed the tales of this wandering god, who the Greeks called Dionysus, and who sailed the seas in a ship with clusters of grapes hanging from its masts. As a god himself, Alexander sought to out-do his predecessor in every way possible. According to one legend, 40 Alexander was once alone in the desert, when suddenly; a ‘spirit’ that carried them into a heavenly abode atop Mount Meru seized him and his horse. (According to Muslim legend, a thousand years later Mohammed was also carried to the same place by his white horse.) ! ! Atop Mount Meru Alexander discovered a structure that glittered with a golden staircase with 2,500 steps and two huge pillars some sixty feet in height. Here, seated on a couch, Alexander encountered a shining green being whom he described as “a flaming fire,” a description which matches that of Moses’ recollection of the God named “ I Am ” who talked with him from behind in the flaming or “burning bush.” (Fire, the Blue Apples muse whispers, is frequency, vibration, knowledge.)"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 104 Nearby, Alexander saw this being’s golden rod, the key Secret of all mysteries -- the branches of a vine with a cluster of grapes at the top . The Green Man seemed puzzled to suddenly find himself in the company of a human being. He asked Alexander how he was able “to penetrate into this darkness, which no other man hath been able to do.” Alexander responded that god himself had given him the means (the uraeus of the Pharoahs or the Key of Life) to make the journey to this place. Where is Alexander? In one version of the story the place of darkness is called the Cave of the Gods. In another version, Alexander is told that he has arrived at “The City of the Storehouse of Life,” from where the “Bright Waters of Life” originated. This is the place from whence the living waters (or living souls), the Holy Light, emanated. According to the Greeks, the Green Man is the King of Hyperboria , 41 the Greek name for Heaven. At the center of Hyperboria is found a mecca for learning called Tula . This land, according to renowned French mythologist Rene Guenon, 42 was the Garden of Eden of our race. The Green Man is the Gardener of the Eden. Judging by the conversation, Alexander seems to have annoyed the Green Man who kept trying to get Alexander to leave. Alexander agreed to grant the Green Man’s wish but only if he were allowed to learn something that no man had ever known before. Fair enough, the Green Man told him: “I will tell thee something whereby thou mayest live and not die... In the land of Arabia (although it could be anywhere), God hath set the blackness of solid darkness wherein is hidden a treasury of this knowledge. There too is the fountain of water which is called ‘The Water of Life’ ;"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 105 and whosoever drinketh therefrom, if it be but a single drop, shall never die .” This living water (wisdom), said the Green Man, could even give men the power to fly through the heavens like the angels. As angels fly on the wings of their bodies of light, it is obvious this drink had a transformative effect on the human body. Alexander could hardly contain his excitement, anxiously asking where in the world he might find this fountain of life. Where is it? Find and ask the heirs to this knowledge, replied the Green Man to Alexander. Then, most importantly, the Gardener handed Alexander a cluster of grapes to feed his troops. At that instant, with the Blue Apples in his hand, Alexander held the secret of immortality. He thought he knew enough. Alas, Alexander died of a fever in Babylon. His coffin has never been discovered."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 106 7. THE SHROUD OF TURIN The Shroud of Turin is the linen cloth alleged to be the burial shroud of Christ. In their quest to answer Grail questions some Grail researchers claim the Grail and the Shroud of Turin is the same thing. While many believe the Shroud should be treated less as a holy relic than as a palladium wielded by the Emperor, if authentic, it is the only known artifact of the Crucifixion (and Jesus’ life for that matter). There is no mention in the Gospels of what Jesus looked like. It is unlikely that there was ever a portrait of Jesus made in his lifetime because of the rigidity with which the Jews interpreted the second commandment. No blood samples of Jesus are said to exist. So, it is impossible to say for certain that the man depicted in the Shroud is or is not Jesus. However, the parallels between the moment in time captured by the Shroud and the story of the Crucifixion of Jesus are striking. In 1898, Secondo Pia, an amateur Italian photographer was appointed to take the first-ever official photograph of the Shroud. When he developed the photographs he found, to his amazement, that there appeared to be a photographic likeness of Jesus."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 107 The Shroud has the front and back images of a crucified man as if the linen had been wrapped around the body from the feet up over the head and back down to the feet, leaving complete front and back images -- including what appear to be bloodstains. The sharp detail of the blood combined with what appear to be teeth, bones, flowers and other objects on the cloth have provoked several scientists to hypothesize that intense radiation involving light and X-ray frequencies produced the images on the linen. X rays do not “just happen.” They are triggered. If the image on the Shroud is a by-product of the Crucifixion it raises a question: what (really) happened at the Crucifixion that caused these X-rays and the formation of the image on the Shroud? One researcher who has deeply considered this question is Thaddeus Trenn, Ph.D., Director of the Science and Religion Course Program at the University of Toronto, Canada. In an interview with science writer Linda Moulton Howe , 1 he advances the arguments of U.S. chemist Dr. Giles Carter, the first, but by no means the last, to observe an X-ray quality to the Shroud‘s image, as suggested by the eerie skeletal appearance of the hands. Dr. Trenn hypothesizes that the body inside the Shroud experienced a dematerialization due to the influx of intense energy that overcame the strong (nuclear) forces that bind the protons and neutrons, and released the matter into energy -- instantly. He was provoked into formulating his hypothesis by the work of other scientists who have shown evidence that the Shroud images are X-rays ."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 108 The frontal view of the man on the Shroud of Turin, as seen on the photographic negative."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 109 The Shroud is discovered hidden above the gate of Edessa. !"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 110 A tile or Stone of Light called the keramion was reputedly discovered along with the Shroud of Edessa bearing the same face as on the cloth.

In other words, as a result of the Crucifixion the man in the Shroud was transformed into a being of light. According to the apocryphal texts, Jesus could dematerialize and materialize at will. After the Crucifixion he frequently appeared to his disciples as a being of light. This hypothesis seems to raise ten provocative questions for every one it answers. What was the power source for the X-rays? Where did the man in the Shroud go? What kind of an event, exactly , was the Crucifixion? One thing is certain. Finding these answers yields tremendous power, both spiritually and militarily speaking. In addition to being a profound key to the Crucifixion, through the centuries the Shroud (or Grail) has enjoyed a fabled reputation as a palladium possessing great powers of protection. In 544, it had reportedly saved the city of Edessa (Thomas’ religious center) from a siege by the mighty Persian army. Many warriors throughout history, including Ivan the Terrible and Adolph Hitler, have sought the military advantage of waving the Shroud or Grail in an enemy’s face. Like the Ark of Covenant, it was both a symbol of humankind‘s covenant with God, but also a weapons system with enormous destructive power. Find the inner secrets of the Grail, and you find military power beyond your wildest dreams."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 112 Was Osiris’ Pillar of Love, which is strikingly similar in design to Van De Graaf generator, the X-ray producing device that created the X-ray on the Shroud of Turin? If Jesus and Mary Magdalene possessed this nuclear technology, the question arises: where did they get it? As noted, the Pillar of Love has for its base a ‘stump’ that resembles the Ark of the Covenant. A remarkable key to the mystery we are investigating is contained in the stories of the Ark, the grapes and a person named Nu, the origins of the word nu clear. The temples dedicated to the Rainbow Goddess Nu throughout the Egyptian and Greek world often featured a carved stone or moon boat containing a figure of a winged or angelic Isis. At Mari, this goddess was depicted wearing the blue stones that turn one into a Shining One around her neck. To the ancients the meaning of this symbol was nu-clear . The winged Rainbow Goddess was bringing a precious gift to humanity in a boat shaped like an arc. This gift was the secret of the shining sun god. In Hebrew history the Babylonian moon goddess Nu-ah and her Arc or Pandora’s box full of secrets appears in the tale of Noah’s Ark in which Noah and his family rode-out the Flood. Genesis 9:8-17 tells how, after the Flood, Yahweh promised Noah never again to destroy humankind by water, and as evidence of his ‘covenant’ set a rainbow in the sky. Later, planting the first vineyard, Noah made wine, got drunk and lay naked in his tent. 2 The Ark reappeared at the time of Moses ( c . 1,400 BC) as the Ark of the Covenant, the repository for the Tablets"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 113 containing the Ten Commandments. The wine of Noah appeared at the Last Supper. Another Hebrew story concerning the Ark, the word nun , and the grapes may provide the answer why. In the relevant episode (Numbers 13) Moses and the Israelites were enroute to the Promised Land. Yahweh ordered them to stop short and to send out some spies. One of Moses’ operatives, Joshua, an ancestor of Jesus, was called the “ Son of Nun .” Along with a companion, Joshua was dispatched to the valley of Eschol (‘valley of the cluster’ as in grapes) where he stole a cluster of grapes from the sons of Anak who were living there. He returned the grapes to Moses. Nun and the cluster of grapes later became cryptograms that were extremely important to the Essenes, the priesthood of which Jesus was a member, and the Gnostic Grail heretics that they held sacred and secret. The cluster of grapes symbolized the secrets of creation, the secrets of manipulating the mother substance and the symbol for the Grail. These secrets existed before the Flood and were ‘brought over’ into the new civilization. Significantly, the name Joshua “Son of Nun” in the Old Testament is the name given in the New Testament as Jesus, the meaning of the name being “God is my savior.” Nun (N), is the fourteenth letter of the alphabet. It means ‘fish’, one of the symbols of Jesus. Webster’s Dictionary says “nun” also refers to birds. 3 ! From the description of their route given in Numbers and the length of their excursion (a ‘magical’ or initiatory forty"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 114 days), it seems Joshua took a survey of a vast land, one larger than the Holy Land which can be surveyed in a lot less than forty days. Joshua and his companion took particular notice of Hebron, the burial ground of the patriarchs whose bones were thought to “mark” this territory as human for all time. Hebron (or is it Heron?), to their horror, was in possession of the sons of Anak (ver. 33) -- who are described not as humans but as giants! The giants themselves lived in a place called Eschcol , the ‘valley of the cluster’ (as in grapes). In a story reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, we learn that when the spies arrived at the land of the giants they stole a branch heavy with grapes. These blue apples are so large it takes two men to carry them (ver. 23,24)! This event is the subject of Poussin's painting. According to Tatiana Kletzky-Pradere’s alluring account in Rennes-le-Chateau: A Visitor’s Guide , 4 at precisely noon on January 17 the Sun’s rays, low on the horizon, pass directly through the patterns on the stained glass windows of the church of Mary Magdalene and project onto the opposite wall a tree covered with round fruit resembling apples. This stunning effect takes on a remarkable significance as the Sun moves through the room. As it moves from left to right, the fruits (changing from blue to red, all except for three of them which remain blue . This stunning effect is short lived. It becomes blurred and then disappears completely. God had promised the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey. These grapes were certainly a healthy down payment! One would think the spies would have returned to Moses enthusiastic about their future prospects."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 115 Instead, Numbers tells us that upon their return the spies counsel Moses that attacking this area would be a nightmare. Why? The cities are impregnable fortresses; they “are walled,” and “very great” (ver. 28). But that’s not all. Even if they overcame the walls nothing could prepare them for the sight of the inhabitants of the vineyards. “We saw the children of Anak there” (ver. 28), the spies reported, “we saw the giants,” those men of a prodigious size, the “sons of Anak,” which “come of the giants” (ver. 33). They speak as if they were ready to tremble at the mention of them. “Oh these tremendous giants! When we were near them we were in our own sight as grasshoppers.” What kind of carnival freak show could these spies possibly have seen? The answer is provided once nephilim , the original Hebrew term used to describe the giants, is decoded. This strange word nephilim has for ages been mistranslated as ‘giants’, leading to numerous erroneous interpretations of Old Testament stories including the story from Numbers 13. One excellent example of its mis-use is Genesis 6:4 where we learn: “The Nephilim were on the Earth in those days, and also afterward, when the Sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown .” Nephilim is not the only word that has been misunderstood in this passage. As Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin pointed out in The Twelfth Planet , 5 the other truly awe-inspiring word that was mistranslated was one that appears in the last line: renown . The correct understanding of these two words revolutionizes Earth history. That other word, shem , has been"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 116 misinterpreted as renown . Thus we have inherited the false legacy that the Nephilim were men of renown when actually the word shem means ‘that which goes up’, as in rocketships (or light bodies). Once we remove the obscuring language, we instantly recognize that what Genesis 6:4, Numbers 13 and the book of Daniel are actually telling us is that the Nephilim, the Sons of An-Ak (the Children of Daniel), the ancient star beings, were on Earth in those days. They, and their children -- the human- alien hybrids -- lived in a valley near vineyards which produced enormous magical grapes. The Sumerians called these Nephilim the A-nun-naki , which as we have seen, literally translates as ‘those from heaven to Earth came’. An-un-naki is very close to the ‘sons of An-Ak’ mentioned in Numbers, and also (not coincidentally) the Ana-sa-zi , the name of the ancestors of the Hopi or Opi Indians of the American Southwest whose name means ‘the peaceful ones’. According to Sumerian myth, Mari/Inanna received the tablets from the creator god named E.A. or Enki, a key figure in Sumerian mythology, and in our story. E.A. was part of an early wave of gods the Sumerians called A-nun-naki , ‘those who came to Earth from Heaven’ in search of gold, rare metals and radioactive materials, such as uranium or cobalt. 6 The latter were described as the Lower World’s “ blue stones ” 7 that could turn a person into an El or “Shining One.” E.A. is routinely depicted emerging from between a double mountain accessed through twin pillars.

The alchemists called it the Green Language. It was the language of nuclear transmutation. What makes this episode so startling to me is a mind- boggling bit of intelligence regarding the vineyards of the A- nun-naki discovered by Moses’ spies. We know that, as the spies reported, the A-nun-naki were certainly militarily stronger than the Israelites. The Sumerian recollections attest they were big in stature and also well armed. This alone would be good reason to follow God’s advice and not to go trodding on their territory. But the Israelite spies reported another even more terrifying (and, therefore to us, a more interesting) reason for staying out of the vineyards. That is this: “ the land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof ”. 8 What a strange and stimulating observation. “The land that eatheth up the inhabitants thereof.” What does this mean? Some think that there was a great plague in the country at the time that they surveyed it. If so, why shroud this simple fact in obscure language? People in ancient times certainly knew the meaning of the word plague. Another interpretation is that the land did not provide enough food for its people, an interpretation which contradicts the belief that this was the land of milk and honey. The phrase, “ the land eateth up the people thereof ” must have a more fantastic explanation. In fact, because of the imprecise language, it must refer to something the spies did not quite understand. What could it possibly be that eats people and makes them disappear from the face of the Earth?"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 120 It would be easy to say the spies saw either a space ship (which in this case they could not imagine, therefore they could not see). If so, they could have said they saw a “cloud,” a term used dozens of times in the Bible during episodes that are strikingly similar to modern day UFO sightings. If they saw an inner Earth opening that consumed people, they could easily have said they saw a cave. So, when they said “the land eateth the people up,” and they saw either individuals or a group of people disappearing into thin air leading them to believe the land consumed them, they must have seen something for which they did not have a word. We now have such a word: stargate. My interpretation of the Rennes mystery asks us to imagine the opening of such a stargate is not some fantasy, but is an actual event that took place in the vineyards of Rennes- le-Chateau. It further asks us to imagine this scenario is the most accurate interpretation of the events foretold to happen in that book to end all books, the Book of Revelation. In Revelation 14:19-20 the wrath of God (his cranky Son) appears and a winepress suddenly opens up: “And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .” Now, a furlong is a cubit and a half. A cubit is 18 inches. After we unzip the calculator and do the math, we learn that the book of Revelation states the wrath of God will open a 12 and a half mile winepress somewhere on Earth. A 12 and a half mile wine press ? What the hell is that? When we unzip this word with our trusty Language of the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 121 Birds word decoder we learn the term winepress means ‘stargate’. A 12 and a half mile stargate will open within the twenty square mile invisible temple complex. What happens once the stargate is open? “And the angel thrust his sickle into the Earth, and gathered the vine of the Earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.” What or who are the vine ? The vine is used in numerous biblical references to describe the Chosen Ones. For instance: “A vine thou didst bring out of Egypt.” 9 “The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the House of Israel and the men of Judah are his cherished plant.” 10 This is likely based on the Sumerian tradition that revered the vine leaf as the sign for ‘life’. In Babylonian tradition the goddess of the Tree of Life (the Pillar of Love), who fertilized the ova of Ava or Eve, was called the ‘Lady of the Vine’. The ‘Lady of the Vine’ is also known as the Great Mother, whom the Hebrews called Mer . This is the Egyptian word for love and the root of the name of Jesus’ mother, Mary, and the Magdalene, his chief apostle and partner. As noted, it comes through the Latin mare , meaning ‘sea’. She is sometimes known as the net and her son the divine fisherman. Jesus was called the ‘fisher of men’."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 122 Fish gods tend a pillar, while a god being hovers above.

Putting a hyperdimensional accent on this apple allows us to get to the core of this proposition. Think of it this way. Scientists used to believe the Earth was flat like a two-dimensional plane. But then, when we went into space, and achieved a higher perspective, we altered our perception and could see that the Earth was round. Many theoretical physicists believe that knowledge of higher dimensions will lead to a comprehensive theory of the universe and will usher in a new golden (or should I say blue) age for humanity. This isn’t some New Age kook science. Thousands of the brightest minds in physics, and massive funding for major research laboratories around the world, are devoted to uncovering the secrets of hyperspace. Many of these scientists were inspired by science fiction stories of time travel, parallel universes, teleportation, time warps -- all ideas which at one time didn’t make any sense but are rapidly becoming scientific fact. Similarly, there are beliefs in mythology that don’t make any sense. For example, gods in space ships, apples of immortality, enlightened beings appearing out of thin air. These events will remain a mystery until we can think hyperdimensionally and unlock ourselves from a flat two- dimensional view of our past and our present. This is why we must understand the concept of the thoughtsphere. If you want to imprison someone in a flat, 2-D world all you have to do is draw a circle around them. The key to escaping prison is the same key used to decode the myths of"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 124 the ancients. It’s not to expand the circle, that just extends the prison walls. We have to be able to jump to a hyper level. Hyperdimensional thinking yields a panoramic overview similar to that achieved when humanity received the first images of the whole Earth from space. For the captive on the 2-D world it enables him to step outside the circle. From this vantage-point the nonsensical can make sense. In physics, expressing nature in higher dimensions makes it simpler. This is the central idea behind Einstein’s theory of relativity. In mythology, expressing stories from a hyper dimension also makes them simpler too. In his book Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th Dimension 11 Michio Kaku tells the story of a race of tiny flatworms living on the surface of large apple. The common sense belief in this world, which they call Appleworld, is that it is flat and two dimensional, like themselves. One daring worm, Colombus, strips this idea to its core when he gets the brilliant idea that Appleworld is actually curved in something he calls the third dimension. Because a third unseen dimension is theoretically impossible in his two-dimensional world, Colombus is labeled a fool. So, he journeys into the horizon and eventually returns home, proving the world is a sphere. Along the way, the mercurial Colombus discovers another way to travel between points on the apple: By digging into the apple, voila, he can create a tunnel that reduces the distance. He calls these wormholes and with them he proves that the shortest distance between two points is not a straight line, it is a wormhole. He also discovers that at the other end of the wormhole time is ticking at a different rate. He is in the past. As Colombus’ messianic career progresses in Kaku’s"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 125 story, he discovers that Appleworld is just one apple in an immense, interconnected tree, which itself is in a magnificent wormhole-riddled orchard or garden. Quite possibly, one can travel from apple to apple instantaneously, as if there were nothing in between. (In France, the possibility exists to go from blue apple to blue apple with nothing in between.) Can we specifically locate the valley Eschcol, the possible stargate location, where Joshua retrieved the Blue Apples in or near Rennes-le-Chateau? The answer is yes, according to Elizabeth van Buren. She says the location of the Valley of Eschol in Poussin’s painting is Rennes-le-Chateau. In the background above the grapes is seen a mountain peak which is easily recognized as Pech Cardou, a mountain nearby Rennes. What might this painting be telling us? In GENESET authors David Wood and Ian Campbell offer a unique insight into Pech Cardou, a view afforded them by looking into Higgins’ Anacalypsis . In the Language of the Birds, the prefix card refers to all matters of the heart or the center. Cardiac and cardinal are two examples. Higgins states that cardo and Ararat (aka Mount Ida) or the Mountain of Cordi, the name of the mountain upon which Noah's Ark came to rest, are interchangeable. From Latin, Higgins defines cardo as a pivot, a hinge, a point about which something turns, and a place of crossing. Shown here is another depiction of the two thieves, Joshua and his companion. They are carrying the cluster of grapes that they have brought to the Crucifixion of Jesus. Here, we must ask a critical question: what are they really carrying?

Why is it associated with the Crucifixion? One answer comes from Chartres. There, on the ‘Symbolic Window of the Redemption’ we see an identical pairing of the two thieves carrying the cluster of grapes beneath a green Cross. This window illustrates the medieval belief in the concordance of the two stories. Old Testament scenes are grouped together with the Passsion of Jesus as if they happened at the same time . In the scene of his Passion Jesus is shown carrying another ever green cross, symbolic of the life-giving power of the blood of Christ and a reference to the belief that the Cross was made of the wood of the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden. Beneath him is the Old Testament prefiguration, the depiction of Joshua and a companion stealing a huge bunch of grapes upon a staff. According to Isidore of Seville, the grapes suspended on a pole symbolize Christ hanging on the cross , for he is the M- Istic grape whose blood fills the Grail. In the following scenes on the Passion window, Jesus is crowned with green thorns, once again inviting us to conclude that his starry helmet or crown of thorns was made from the same material (or technology) as the Cross or Pillar, i.e. palladium. THE SHROUD IN THE LANGUEDOC ! Shroud researcher Jack Markwardk notes that “at the precise time when the Cathars desperately required protection from Innocent, their religious brethren in Constantinople were, week after week, witnessing the exhibition and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 128 representation of the alleged burial cloth of Christ as a tried, true and mighty palladium .” 12 In 1203, four years before the attack on the Cathars, the Church’s search for Christian relics was massively underway. Word of the Shroud in Byzantine Constantinople influenced the diversion of the Fourth Crusade to ‘the new Rome’ built by Constantine, to repossess relics from the schismatic Greeks. As Ian Wilson observed, 13 in April of 1204, the Fourth Crusade attacked Constantinople and, in the resultant chaos, someone -- other than the pope’s man -- stole the Shroud. The Shroud reappeared in Lirey, France a century and a half later with no explanation given for its whereabouts during these “Missing Years.” Markwardk suggests that it was a Cathar sympathizer who pilfered the relic, concealed it, and sent it to the Languedoc, not as an object of religious veneration, but as a powerful palladium that could be employed against the fanatically- militant Church of Rome. (If my theory is correct it was used as source material for elucidating the secret of transmuting the elements.) Markwardk presents circumstantial evidence from the Grail myth Parzival in which, he says, its author, Wolfram, clearly demonstrates that by 1207 it was common knowledge that the Shroud -was in the possession of the heretics of the Languedoc. Were the alchemical secrets of how the image upon it was formed there as well? Wolfram said the Grail, the palladium, was hidden in a place called Munsalvaesche , the Mount of Salvation. Templars wearing white surcoats with red crosses guarded it. This locale’s description was very much like Montsegur, the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 129 Cathar seminary/fortress. On November 12, 1207, Innocent ordered a crusade against the Cathars. Using trumped-up charges of murder, which the Cathars had nothing do with, as a pretext for the crusade Innocent launched his military invasion to retrieve the secrets of the Cathar’s palladium, and then wipe them off the face of the Earth. ! THE CATHAR’S THREE-NAIL CRUCIFIXION ! Markwardk observes that in the early thirteenth century, the Crucifixion was typically depicted with Christ affixed to the cross with four nails, one placed through each of his hands and feet. During the Albigensian (Cathar) Crusade, reports were circulated of a three-nail crucifixion. This gave Innocent all the ammunition he needed. He proclaimed an official four- nail dogma and condemned as heretics anyone who asserted the use of three nails. This three-nail, four-nail Crucifixion business may sound petty. However, there is a lot riding on the distinction between the two. “In an attempt to win converts,” says Markwardk, some Cathars employed a crucifix which had no upper arm (a T), the feet of Christ crossed, and three nails.” There is a mystery here, he says, of why Cathars, who rejected the reality of Christ’s death, would assert a three-nail crucifixion or employ a three-nail crucifix, particularly when attempting to proselytize orthodox believers who were accustomed to, and who were bound to believe in, a four-nail “spread-eagle” portrayal. A close examination of the Shroud reveals that only one nail pierced Christ’s feet and the Cathars’ possession of the cloth with its evidence of the use of one nail through both feet crossed would explain their"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 130 assertion of a three-nail crucifixion. Their use of the Bird Language also links them with Jesus. The Cathars had clearly drawn a knowledge line in the sand, possibly based upon actual knowledge from the Shroud, which contradicted the traditional and papally mandated (mis)beliefs of the conventional Christians in Rome. ! THE LAND OF AK ! Markwardk does not offer any additional explanation or further elucidation regarding the Cathar three-nail Cross mystery. Speculative though this may be, I have found an explanation for the meaning of the three-nail cross in the Land of Ak, not in France, but in the Kingdom of Ak-kad , mentioned in the Bible (Genesis) as existing in Mesopotamia (mostly now Iraq) before Babylon. Historians contend that Ak-kad was the first great empire in history. Sargon who, after an affair with the goddess Inanna, became the ‘Righteous Ruler’ founded it. He built his empire in Mesopotamia during the 2300’s BC and gained control over much of southwestern Asia. 14 Beginning in the early 1900’s teams of archaeologists discovered the remains of Akkad. They began stocking the world’s museums with the remains of Akkad: ceremonial gates, bas-reliefs of winged-bulls, chariots, gold jewelry. The most valuable of their artifacts, as far as we are concerned, was their writings. Thousands upon thousands of records written in cuneiform (from “cuneus,” Latin for wedge) script were recovered. Cuneiform is a triangular, pyramid-shaped language."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 131 “Like bird tracks on wet sand.” This is how cuneiform script struck the first Europeans to lay eyes on it. Once deciphered archaeologists learned these records contained cosmological myths, epic poems, histories of kings, astronomical tables, mathematical formulas, grammar and vocabulary school texts. Most prized of all were their recollections of the comings, goings and doings of the gods. Here is the connection to the Cathar three-nail cross. Whenever archaeologists discovered remains of the early Sumerian civilizations, including Akkad, the symbol of the “Planet of the Gods” was prominently displayed. The name for their home was Nibiru or NAM.TILLA.KU , “the god who maintains life.” Nam.Tilla.Ku literally means Name or Destiny (NAM) of God (KU) is Tula (TILLA). Tula was known to the Akkadians as the: • “bestower of cultivation,” • creator or grain and herbs who causes vegetation to sprout,” • who opened wells, apportioning waters of abundance ,” and • irrigator of Heaven and Earth.” 15 The Akkadian astronomical and religious beliefs maintained Nam.Tilla.Ku was a twelfth planet in our solar system. They sometimes called it the Lord. The pictographic sign for this planet was a three-nail cross. 16 The cuneiform cross sign was composed of three wedge- like symbols that resemble nails. This three-nail cross sign, says Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin, meant “Anu” and “divine.” It evolved, he says, in the Semetic languages to the letter T or tau .

The three-nail cuneiform Akkadian cross, symbol for ‘god.’ ! Nam.Tilla.Ku was the home of E.A. the fish god. What, I must ask, are the odds that the Cathars, who spoke the language of Ak, would revere a three-nail cross that precisely matches description of the divine three-nail cross of Akkad twenty-three centuries before them? The Cathars are thought to have possessed the Grail: the secret of peace, the secret of transforming the wasteland into a garden, and a powerful palladium. In an identical tradition, recorded in Mesopotamian texts, when the “Planet of the Gods” appeared it would usher in a new era. “Peace would descend on land... Akkad would overflow with plenty and the king of Akkad would grow powerful,” say the texts. Like the Grail, the appearance of Nam.Tilla.Ku gave the King virility."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 133 The similarities between the Mesopotamian prophecy of the return of the Planet of the Gods (Tula) and the transformation of humanity and Earth with the return of the Grail are an extraordinary coincidence. The Hebrew prophet Isaiah’s prophecy of peace that would wash over the Earth after the Day of the Lord bears more than a passing resemblance to this theme: “And it shall come to pass at the End of Days... the Lord shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many peoples. They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation.” For some strange reason, the pope was seeking to eradicate the three-nail cross symbol of Peace that brought balance to humanity. One other point is meaningful here. The gods from Tula were called A-nun-naki. Sitchin interprets this name as “those who came to Earth from Heaven.” 17 In the Language of the Birds, the A-nun-naki may be interpreted as the holy (an) fish (nun), of Light (aki). The “sons of Anak” were the ones from whom Joshua son of Nun stole the cluster of grapes. The fish-suited gardener who came from this land brought his remarkably creative Pillar with him. The sign of the Fish-god who tended the I- link and the Net between Heaven and Earth was an H. To me the surprising correspondences between the Cathar three-nail cross and the Anunnaki three-wedge cross suggest that the Cathars were reviving an ancient religion based upon the worship of a group of gods, including E.A., who came from a ‘missing’ planet in our solar system."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 134 8. THE STARGATE OF BABYLON Mary Magdalene’s connection to the Danites is invaluable. When we dig into their history we find astonishing stargate imagery in the story of their encounter with a stargate at Babylon. The dateline is c. 600 BC. The subject is King Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, 1 who had recently conquered Jerusalem, 2 flattened its walls, stripped its Temple of all its treasure 3 (presumably including the Language of the Birds and the Ark of the Covenant), set the city ablaze, and returned home to Babylon with the treasure of the Temple 4 and a group of royal prisoners of war. 5 Included among the captives were three wise men from the Temple, a young man and ‘master magician’ named Daniel, and another prominent prophet, Ezekiel, who had visions of ‘the kingdom of Heaven on Earth’ 6 while imprisoned in Babylon. King Nebuchadnezzar is probably best known as the builder of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. These gardens were built upon the seven stages of the fantastic ziggurat of Marduk, the well known Tower of Babel, which Nebuchadnezzar restored. Babel originates from the word Bab-li , which in the Babylonian language meant ‘Gate of God’. This is our first tip-off that Nebuchadnezzar attempted to construct a means --"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 135 perhaps even a stargate -- to transcend earth life and travel the cosmos. Nebuchadnezzar was driven to build the Hanging Gardens by his belief that he was to emulate Sargon, c. 2,300 B.C., the great king of Akkad (now northern Iraq) -- a name from which is derived the term Akka , the name of the Creator goddess Akka and the first Semetic language. Akka comes from the primitive linguistic root ak , meaning great or mighty . The ak is persistently present in words which relate to our Languedoc, or Language of Ak. As noted, in Egypt, akh was the Pharaonic word for all aspects of light, particularly the ‘transcendental’ light of the transfiguration. BABYLON The ruins of Babylon are found buried beneath the sands of Iraq about twenty miles from modern-day Baghdad. In its glory the city of Babylon was the greatest city in Mesopotamia -- the center of the new world order. It was a veritable playground for the gods. The ziggurat or temple of Marduk which formed its center and the Tower of Babel were awesome structures by any standard. The Marduk temple housed the golden image of Bel and a strange golden table, which combined weighed nearly fifty thousand pounds of solid gold! Nebuchadnezzar’s Hanging Gardens must have been a spectacular, perhaps unbelievable, sight to Daniel and the rest of the Jewish captives, sort of like placing a war-torn Bosnian child in Disneyland today. Growing on a huge seventy-five- foot high artificial mountain, the Hanging Gardens could be"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 136 seen for fifty miles across the flat desert. The seven terraces held trees, vines and flowers and were watered by a system of wells and fountains. King Nebuchadnezzar had this wonder built for his queen who longed to return to her mountain homeland. One entered Babylon through the Processional Way, which led to the famed Ishtar Gate. This enormous entranceway was covered with brilliant blue glazed tiles on which were depicted lions, bulls and dragons in bas-relief. These animals represented the gods of the city, Marduk the dragon king was the most potent. Isis was the lion. As its king, Nebuchadnezzar expanded Babylon’s fortifications, paved her streets, and dug canals. Nebuchadnezzar was revered in his homeland as more than just a great temple builder. He was also revered as a wise man who surrounded himself with astrologers, architects, magicians, sorcerers -- anyone who could help him decode his dreams and visions, some of which were deeply troubling to him. This made it perfectly natural for Daniel and the wise men from Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem to be mixed in with the sages of Babylon. Surprisingly, the Jews discovered that the Babylonians possessed long sought answers concerning their past. This is because the Jewish and Babylonian histories emerged from the same original source in Sumeria. From the Sumerian stories the Hebrews found missing pieces to their own Flood story and story of Creation. With a few name changes here and there both traditions match. Most scholars now believe it was here in Babylon during the captivity of Nebuchadnezzar that the first five books of the Old Testament, including Daniel and Ezekiel, were"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 137 constructed (with a lot help from the original Sumerian stories). Most Christians are shocked to learn the stories that form the foundation of their religion are copies of original stories that belonged to another time, place and people. As important as it is to realize the context in which these books were assembled -- the captivity of their authors -- it is more important to realize that they are a compilation of actual history, mythology, literary devices and fond memories of a past that never was Hebrew, but Sumerian . Separating Hebrew from Sumerian is crucial. Why deal with second-hand copies when the originals are more valuable and accurate? The marriage between the Sumerian and Hebrew mythologies was a match made in heaven. It was as if each carried the missing half to the other’s message. This situation required that one side had to make a deal with the devil to get what they wanted. What both sides apparently wanted was access to the stargate. NEBUCHADNEZZAR’S STARGATE ENCOUNTER Nebuchadnezzar’s Stargate encounter began when he acknowledged that Daniel had immense prophetic gifts, including the ability to interpret dreams. In chapter four of Daniel, he is asked to interpret a dream in which Nebuchadnezzar saw: ‘ a tree in the midst of the Earth, and the height thereof was great. The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached into heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of the Earth ’. 7"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 138 There was great fruit in this tree and the birds of Heaven lived in its branches. From this tree the king saw a “watcher” and a “holy one” from Heaven emerge. 8 They told him to destroy the tree, and leave its ‘stump’ in the Earth. 9 This was a confusing dream to the king. But not to us. The “watchers” is the Egyptian name for “divine being” or “god” NTR, or neter, which means “one who watches.” 10 Neter-neter land is the name of the place in the stars where these beings dwell (along with the Green Man or Gardener). Sumeria, another earthly land of the An-un-naki, was known as the land of ‘ones who watch’. Why didn’t the watchers want Nebuchadnezzar to join them in Neter-neter land? Could it be that it was because Nebuchadnezzar was not one of them (but Daniel was, which explains why he could interpret their symbols)? What did they mean by leaving the ‘stump’ of the ‘tree’ in the ground? Nebuchadnezzar wanted to know. Did this dream foretell disaster of a project represented by the tree? If so, what is the specific project that is in danger? The story is told of what happens when Nebuchadnezzar sets-up an image of gold in Babylon. 11 This isn’t some ancient status symbol the king kept on his desk. The image is a massive three score (60) cubits high and six cubits wide. A cubit is 18 inches, making the image 540 inches high (three score or thirty times 18 inches high). 540 inches is 45 feet high, about the size of a four and a half story building!

Any “who would not worship the image of the beast should be killed,” says Revelation. Nubachadnezzar, on the other hand, could not make this gleaming Golden Head speak. This was a major failure. Like the tribal leader David, who ruled Jerusalem five hundred years before him, the king had planned to unify his kingdom, the golden image was the unifying force. He tried using music to get it to work. He demanded that when the people heard the music play they were to fall down and worship the golden image (as if this act would impress the lifeless heap). 12 If they didn’t they would be tossed into a burning fiery furnace. 13 Ultimately, as the story goes, along come the three wise Jews from Babylon (friends of Daniel), and Abednegor (who worked at the Temple of Solomon). 14 Unfortunately for Nebuchadnezzar, they refuse to worship the hulking image or the god of the Babylonian king. What is more, the three insult Nebuchadnezzar by betting the king that their god will save them from the fiery furnace. 15 Clearly, the three wise men from the Temple of Solomon possess crucial knowledge that Nebuchadnezzar needs to make this golden gadget work.

If it is correct to associate the Golden Pillar with the forty five-foot ‘tree’ of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, and the Ark with the ‘stump’, it now makes perfect sense why Nebuchadnezzar would wish to involve Daniel in this project. It was the sons of D’Anu, the people of Daniel, who had originally brought this device to Earth. The angel who appeared to the king was related to the Daniel.

He was the gatherer of souls or ‘gardener of souls’. He shared with his wife a magnificent Underworld was called ‘the Abysmal Womb’, the Land of Death. He holds the key to heaven and hell, also known as the Key of Life. It is no coincidence that Jesus identifies himself as this figure in the book of Revelation: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys (the ‘open sesames’) of hell and heaven .” 17 This womb was believed to be a place of regeneration, an ‘egg’, if you please, where humans transformed themselves into higher beings (of light, capable of going through the stargate).

That is, if they turn out to be anything like the coat, the hat and the other garments the goddess Inanna is wearing in The Goddess with a Vase discovered at Inanna’s temple at Mari. As we discussed, Inanna is shown wearing the Shugurra helmet (‘a hat’) that makes her go far into the universe.

He was then led to the place of crucifixion. At noon he was raised and affixed to a vertical pillar, which, legend says was set up in the exact place where Adam’s skull was buried.

However, their transgression must have been significant to warrant such a horrific form of capital punishment. On the other hand Jesus’ crime was explicitly stated.

Exoterically, this is translated as “ Jesus the Nazorean, King of the Jews .” 11 This declared the official capitol charge against Jesus -- declaring himself the one and only savior and challenging the sovereign authority of Tiberius Caesar -- and at the same time mocked him.

Jesus repeatedly refers to Moses. What is the explanation for Jesus’ action and statement: “And as Moses lifted the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth may in Him have eternal life.

In this story the Apostle Paul is visiting the 9- mile-long island of M-Alta (then called Melita), a center of serpent soul worship beneath the southern tip of Italy. The underworld of the gods, it was claimed, was accessed from this island. Paul is bit by a serpent or viper on the island, and survived only by the power of the risen Jesus.

As noted, in the Hebrew Bibles, all references to serpents are made by use of the word nahash (from the stem NHSH). This term does not relate to serpents in the way that we would know them -- that is, reptiles. It relates to serpents in their traditional capacity as bringers of wisdom and enlightenment, and to souls, since NHSH is also the stem for the Hebrew Nashamah, or soul. The word nahash actually means ‘to decipher’ or ‘to find out’. Serpent souls , in one form or another, were always associated with wisdom and healing, and the Trees of Life and Knowledge are customarily identified with serpents. Indeed, the logo of today’s American and British medical associations is a copy of this image of a serpent soul coiled around the Tree of Life -- a depiction shown in the clay reliefs of ancient Sumer and identified as E.A.’s personal logo. When Jesus arrived at the beginning of the Age of Pisces to become the new Lord of the Temple (or A-Tum Pillar), he supplanted Tammuz who became the Doubting Thomas, the apostle who challenged Jesus’ claim to authentic apotheosis and resurrection in the flesh.

The Gnostic Holy Book of the Invisible Spirit or The Egyptian Gospel affirms this. 18 Composed before 350 AD, this Gospel contains the “true history” of the line of the Savior and tells of the Great Invisible Spirit who emanated from the “eternal light of the aeons.” Three powers emanated from it: namely the father, the mother and the son.

The Gospel describes E.A. saying, “inasmuch as Adam is light that has radiated... this being (E.A.) is the eye of light .” 20 This is the same eye of light that appears on the logo of the American enterprise. The Gnostic Gospel of the Egyptians is divided into two parts. The first is a revisionist “true history” of Adam’s son Seth down to Jesus, the final incarnation of the Savior. The second part is a liturgical service book for gnostic baptism. This book begns with a uranographic catalog (a list of structural elements of the universe) and concludes with a hymn spoken by the newly baptized gnostic. This gospel describes the spiritual universe as a ‘ throne room ’ . A Word of power, the Name of God, it says, is written on a “tablet” near the “throne of glory.” This Word of power emanated from a Great Light (that would be Tula) along with seven powers (rays), which are the seven vowels: I ,E,O,U,E,A,O. Before the baptism these letters are spoken as a hymn spoken by the newly baptized gnostic.

This is the foundation of Rosicrucian philosophy. In mystic circles the Rosicrucian genius Francis Bacon is regarded not as a man, but rather as a bridge between an invisible world and the Earthly world. Manly P. Hall states, “In all probability, the keys to the Baconian riddle will be found in classical mythology. He who understands the secret of the Seven Rayed God will comprehend the method employed by Bacon to accomplish his monumental labor.” 22 In French the Language of the Birds is called ‘langue des oiseaux’. The word oiseaux , or bird, is one of the rare French words which contains all the vowels A, E, I, O, U. Who is the ‘seven Rayed God’? One answer is the Egyptian heron. Another is Sarapis. We looked at Sarapis earlier. Sarapis was called the god with the name of seven letters. In their hymns to Sarapis the priests chanted the seven vowels. Occassionally Sarapis is depicted with horns or a coronet of seven rays.

It is drawn from the rectangular zodiac carving which once graced the ceiling of the great temple Hathor at Denderah. It shows the first rays of the risen sun, Re or Horus (the Sun god) defeating the polar stars of Draconis and of the Ursa Major , the Plough. 25 The sunbeam or spear is pointed directly at the group of stars which we today call the Ursa Major or the Plough, but which the Egyptians called the “ Thigh ” or alternately the “Haunch of the Bull.” 26 What does this have to do with the thigh of the prophecy of the return of Jesus (and with the wounding of the thigh of the Grail King in Grail legend)?

He is here represented ‘slaying the dragon’ (the hippo was the ‘dragon’ of the Nile). The dragon in question could be the planet Tiamat, which was a member of the Pleiades, known as the Seven Hathors to the Egyptians, which are found in the constellation Taurus the Bull. Tiamat was destroyed in the heavens. However, the Bull could also be Osiris, who was called the ‘Bull of Heaven’ . 27 Does this suggest the real meaning of the mark on the “thigh” of Jesus, and the ‘word of power’, has something to do with Orisis and the Seven Stars of Ursa Major or the Pleiades? In this case the Bull or Thigh of Osiris would appear to be another name for the Pillar of Osiris. In many of the myths of the appearance of the messiah we have seen the Golden Pillar featured as the storage device for the soul of the savior. We have associated this Pillar with Mount Meru. Incredibly, in Greek, Meros means thigh . In Greek myth the savior Bacchus was nourished in a thigh . The Greek historian Herodotus says that Jupiter (‘the shining god of light’, who is also Di Pater, Dis Pater or Ptah) carried Bacchus in his thigh to Nysa (Meru). According to Budge, none other than Osiris built Nysa. 28 Osiris was known as the heron and he was a gardener. In John 20:18, Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord in the Garden. He appeared to her as the Gardener, and spoke to her (no doubt in the Language of the Birds, the language of nature). When Mary went to embrace him, Jesus responded “Do Not Touch Me,” indicating his inability to be touched."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 158 Biblical interpreters say Jesus was in his phantom body, and therefore, could not be physically touched. Later that day Jesus appeared to the rest of the disciples. He stood in the midst (or mist?), and said to them Peace be unto you. Jesus then delivered the cleansing mysteries described in the Pistis Sophia that transformed the disciples into beings of pure light (in other words a ‘Cathar’ or pure one). The exact nature of this teaching is not disclosed in the Gospels. No matter how bizarre these considerations and connections may at first seem, it appears Jesus’ innermost teaching included the Language of the Birds and the ability to transmute the elements. With Jesus having just returned with the wisdom of how to achieve this light body or phantom body transformation the disciples were in no position to deny that he knew what he was talking about. Thomas, however, was not present when Jesus came. He refused to believe Jesus was risen until he saw for himself. 29 Jesus reappeared eight days later. This time Thomas was present. Upon seeing Jesus he proclaimed him his god. 30 Afterwards Thomas went to Taxila in India in the year 40 AD to begin his ministry. As we have noted, the Romans called Thomas or Tammuz Adonis (or A-ton), and said he was the chief god of the Jews. The fact that Jesus and Adonis shared the same name “Adonai” or “Lord” is beyond coincidental. The Syrian Acts of Thomas put a strange kink in this story. They declare that Thomas was Jesus’ twin brother, and that his full name was Judas Tammuz or Judas Thomas . The Kor-An insists that Judas had the same face as Jesus and was crucified in his place. “A servant of Jesus Christ and"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 159 brother of James authored the New Testament epistle of Jude (short for Judas).” 31 James was Jesus’ brother. Does this make Judas Jesus’ twin brother Thomas as the Syrians and The Gospel of Thomas insist? The Catholic Church has demonized Tthe Gospel of Thomas like a bastard child. Does this explain why? Judas is also the name of the father of the nation of Judah and of Jews or Judaei . 32 The Judaei connection takes us straight to the Djed or Djedi Pillar or the Casket/Thigh of Osiris, the earthly dwelling of the serpent soul . According to legend, Judas was sent out to sea in a chest or cista , a mystic casket that found its way to the isle of Iscariot, the source of his full name Judas Iscariot . 33 A casket set out to sea? We are told that the palladium- lined Grail Pillar or casket is a ‘floating’ stone. Is it possible this is telling us that not only did Judas the A-tom live in the Pillar, but that it was capable of floating? Does that mean floating in water? In air? In space? In suspended animation? From place to place? IT IS FINISHED In the English language version of the story presented in the Gospel of Mark, immediately after the Crucifixion Joseph of Arimathea asked Pontius Pilate for Jesus’ body. Pilate is astonished that Jesus is dead so soon, 34 it usually took several excruciatingly painful days for the crucified to perish. That was the point."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 160 The Gospels record that Jesus was suspended from the pillar at the sixth hour (noon), at the ninth hour (3 p.m.) he said he thirsted and was given a sponge soaked with vinegar by a Roman centurion (in fulfillment of Psalm 22:16 and Zecharia 12:10). When Jesus received the vinegar, which normally has a reviving effect, Jesus said, “It is finished: and bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.” 35 By nightfall he was declared dead. This is where medical doctors see trouble in the story of the Crucifixion. How is it possible, they wonder that a viral and powerful man such as Jesus (the image on the Shroud of Turin is that of man who was about 5’ 10” tall, 165 pounds) could have died so quickly? Pilate also had reason to be surprised. Jesus’ legs were not even broken, the customary coup de grace which hastened death so that the dead bodies did not remain on the pillars on the Sabbath day. 36 The breaking of the legs prevented the crucified from straightening out their bodies. This assured suffocation within a few hours. Mallets broke the legs of the thieves. Jesus’ legs were left untouched because he was believed to be dead already. So how come he died so soon? Pilate conferred on this matter with a Roman centurion who is named Longinus in the apocryphal Book of Nicodemus. According to the Gospel of John, he was the centurion who thrust his lance into the side of Jesus to confirm his death. 37 Blood and water flowed out. None of the other Gospels mention Longinus’ action or the transformed blood and water of Christ. Yet in the Gospel of John this blood simultaneously verified Jesus was dead and that the faith of Christ is centered in his blood and water."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 161 John states: “ And when he saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe .” This blood is the blood of atonement described in Leviticus 17:11: “ For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul .” Longinus became an early hero of the first Christians for his actions that Good Friday in April 2,000 years ago. If Jesus’ legs had been broken his body weight would have crushed his lungs causing him to die from asphixiation. Most importantly, if Jesus’ legs had been broken, the prophecy of Exodus 12:46 “... a bone of him shall not be broken” would have been unfulfilled. Some say that in that moment, by his single action, Longinus held the destiny of the world in his hands. When he made the decision to pierce the side of Jesus he altered history. LONGINUS AND THE SPEAR OF DESTINY ! Longinus the centurion and his Spear are the subject of immense mystery. According to legend, he was nearly blind. In the apocryphal Acta Pilata , Longinus was the supervisor of the Crucifixion. Herod the Great is said to have possessed the Spear before Longinus. 38 He used it as the symbol of his power and authority when he allegedly ordered the death of every male child in Judea in order to eliminate the Christ child who would become the King of the Jews. The head of the Temple Guard assigned to order the breaking of Jesus’ legs later carried it.

A few drops of blood and water spilled on his face that restored Longinus’ vision, gave him spiritual sight and changed the history of the world. Thus, his ordinary lance became known as ‘the Spear of Destiny’. Occult legend says that whoever possesses and understands the powers of the Spear, holds the destiny of the world in his hands. 39 As the symbol of the magical powers inherent in the blood of God’s ‘chosen people’, the Spear, it is said, stands at the gate between good and evil. Christian legend also claims Longinus was a secret follower of Jesus. He is the same centurion who, transformed by the events that transpired at the Crucifixion, praised Jesus as the true Son of God. 40 He was also the centurion who confirmed the death of Jesus to Pilate, and who then released the body of Jesus to another of Jesus’ secret disciples, Joseph of Arimathea. It has even been suggested that Longinus was the Roman soldier who administered the ‘vinegar’ to Jesus. In their carefully researched work, The Jesus Conspiracy , 41 Holger Kersten and Elmar Gruber note that an error of translation was made when the word hyssos (‘short spear’) was taken for hyssopos (‘hyssop’). Through this error it is revealed that, instead of a spear, Longinus held up a sponge soaked in a narcotic substance that put Jesus into a cat- atonic state, giving him the appearance of death.

Additionally, it has been argued for centuries that Longinus’ piercing and the wound it caused was not sufficient to kill Jesus. The wounds that appear on the body in the Shroud of Turin tend to support this. So, the question continues to be asked: is the Gospel of John indicating that Jesus was still alive after the Crucifixion? Dead Sea Scroll scholar Hugh Schonfield, 42 and the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail 43 note that in the original Greek version of Mark’s Gospel, when Joseph asks for Jesus’ body he uses the word soma -- a word they propose applied to a living body. Pilate responds in the affirmative, but uses the word ptoma -- which means “corpse.” 44 This is a perplexing state of affairs. Given the two different words, soma and ptoma, did Joseph receive a living or a dead body? This is the vital question of Christianity. 1 Corinthinians asks “If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching in vain, and your faith is also vain?” 45 John’s Gospel says that, along with Nicodemus, Joseph pulled Jesus’ mangled body from the pillar. Without the knowledge or involvement of any of the other apostles they rushed the body to Joseph’s garden and went immediately to work. The two men treated the open cuts and wounds with a sticky gel made from over 100 pounds of aloe, myrrh and other medicinal herbs. 46 They wrapped his body in a linen shroud, and placed it in Joseph’s private tomb, sealing it with a large rolling rock. Were they preparing Jesus’ body for burial or healing the massive wounds? Joseph came from Arimathea near the Samarian border. He returned there after the Crucifixion, suggesting he lived there.

THE BLOOD OF LIFE ! There may be another way of looking at the Crucifixion, and hence, another way of resolving the contradiction of these terms. One possible explanation for the use of the two different words, soma and ptoma, to describe Jesus’ body is that the Gospel writers were expert word workers. They understood that words have history and multiple levels of meaning. They treated words similar to the way a geologist treats a core sample of soil. More profoundly they also understood that many words have secret meanings hidden beneath their surface. As the book of Daniel states, “for the words are to remain secret and sealed until the time of the end.” 1 The Gospel writers frequently used words with double meanings to describe the same thing. This enabled them to conceal the true meaning of their words while at the same time telling those ‘in the know‘ exactly what they meant. They did this to escape persecution by opposing religious and political authorities, and also to communicate ala Winston Churchill and F.D.R., between themselves. The word soma is not an original Hebrew, Greek or Latin word. Precedent for this word is found in the Hindu Vedas where soma refers to “ the blood of life ” and “a mystical substance of the body.” 2"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 166 The Greeks applied it to the “supernatural red wine“ of the Greek mother goddess Hera , who gave the Greek gods immortality. Saxons worshipped her at Heresburg (Hera’s Mount), where the phallic “column of the world” called Hermeseul (Herme’s Soul or Stone Soul) was planted in the Earth-goddess’s yoni (womb). 3 In their word play the Gospel writers are therefore hinting that Joseph was asking for the literal blood of the hare, Christ, or alternatively, some form of life-prolonging wisdom which enabled one to transform the vibration of their own blood into such a state. The hare provides a link between Osiris “the Good Hare,” and the secrets of the Crucifixion revealed on the first Easter Sunday, now symbolized by a rabbit. In addition, the Chinese H-Sien alchemists were among those who are believed to have found the elixer of life and transformed themselves into material but immortal ‘light’ beings. 4 Their secrets of immortality were also symbolized by the hare. Being immortal and confined to Earth might not be a lot of fun. The myths of the hare’s hole in space we have examined and the connections we have made between the hare and stories featuring interdimenstional travel indicate that the rabbit’s hole of myth was actually a wormhole or stargate. The transformation into a shining being of light undergone by the H-Siens and others indicates that it was a necessary preparation for travelling via these stargates. Simply, one would not just enter one of these gateways. There is a profound spiritual and technical transformation that must be undergone first. Further, these connections enable us to view the Crucifixion of Christ as a stargate event in which the hare,"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 167 Jesus, demonstrated how to blast through the rabbit hole opened by the Pillar of the Goddess Hare or Hara. Joseph of Arimathea was ready for the result of this A-tomic process. Once apprehended, the Bible affirms this view in its version of the Crucifixion. THE CROWN OF THE WORLD ! The Gospels go to great pains to document that Jesus was made to wear a crown of thorns and a royal purple robe enroute to the Crucifixion. 5 The stargate theory in which Jesus travels into the A~tum or a~tom explains why was attired in this manner. Jesus was called the Nazarene. This has been thought to refer to Nazareth, the town where Jesus is alleged to have lived. Bethlehem, Nazareth and Galilee all claim to be the home of Jesus. Scholars now claim, however, that the town of Nazareth did not exist at the time of Jesus. Therefore, Nazarene must refer to something else. As we have noted, names and words mean different things at different times in history. Drilling to the depths of the meaning of the word “Nazorean” or “Nazarene” holds the means to decipher the meaning of Jesus’ robe and crown of thorns and their use in the opening of the stargate. As we have seen, Nazorean has been interpreted in multiple ways. Historian Michael Grant interprets Nazoraios as “guardian,” and says it comes from the root netser , meaning “shoot” or “branch” ( klone in Latin) . 6 Jesus was known as the branch of David, the long-awaited Messiah. Grant identifies Jesus as a member of an exclusive religious sect of priest-kings who guarded or “watched” the"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 168 secrets of the ancient science of salvation and enlightenment. This group inherited this role from Egypt and the ancient Neter (also rendered as nuter or Nu ), 7 meaning “one who watches.” 8 The Neter were the male god-beings of Egypt. Nu-trit , “nurturer,” was the feminine for neter. 9 Budge notes that neter was a term used to denote a quality of soul. 10 As it is mentioned in opposition to “the dead,” he says, it appears to refer to a “living” or “strong” soul. 11 These terms align with the thesis that Lord Melchizedek (E.A.) initiated a Grail bloodline to preserve the secrets of enlightenment. In order to access these secrets, which were symbolized by the H , one had to be born into the bloodline or transform the rhythm or vibration of one’s blood to match that of the Neter. Jesus (sometimes called Jesus H. Christ) was a descendent of the bloodline of Abraham, who first received this H , as well as of David and Aaron, the magician-priest and brother of Moses. As the Nazarene, Jesus was therefore, a Neter or NTR, or protector of knowledge. In the Book of the Dead neter is mentioned in connection to eternal existence and self- production, which Budge links to the power to “renew life indefinitely.” 12 In other words, he says, neter appears to refer to a being who has the power to generate life. The word neter passed over directly into the Coptic language as nouti and noute , both terms meaning “God” and “Lord.” 13 Both terms were applied to Jesus. The secret knowledge I propose Jesus possessed and protected was the nuclear secrets of the transformation of the human being into a neter preparatory to travelling to Neter-Neter land, the home of the"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 169 gods, and of Neter netri , the secrets of “self-produced, primeval matter.” 14 These guardians were known for their trademark, untrimmed hair. Legend claimed there was great power in their hair. Later, the word kaisear (later caesar and czar ), meaning “ crown of hair ” was adopted to describe these guardians. 15 In the Bird Language, the “crown of hair” is a phonetic word play linking it with the “crown of the hare,” or the crown of the goddess Hara . Another name for this crown is the Shugurra helmet of the goddess Mari (also known as Hara ), which enabled her to “go far into the universe.” As the Bible records, Jesus wearing of the Crown of (T)horns at the Crucifixion had the same effect. The harlot or hare lot, priestess of Hara, Mary Magdalene undoubtedly knew true meaning of this Crown. Christ’s Crown of Thorns, woven it is said from acacia, the same living wood as Osiris’ palladium Pillar and the Ark of the Covenant, is a solar crown. As in the case of the goddess Mari, this crown was worn in conjunction with the Pillar, which I have noted, resembles a Van de Graaf generator or a~tom smasher.

The word Sa Ba catches our attention. This is not an original Hebrew word. We have already seen it used in the name Sabala , from the Central Asian myth of Mount Meru and Shambhala. When we drill into the meanings of this word we discover that in ancient Egyptian Sa is the word for the holy blood of Isis . Like its counterpart the Hindu soma it made pharaohs immortal. 17 This blood contained the Great Mother’s spirit of all sacred wisdom or intelligence (which the Greeks called nous ). 18 Ba means soul . During his sa -crifice Jesus ‘gave up the spirit’, one of the few Crucifixion events which all four Gospel writers agree happened. 19 His uttering of Psalm 22 indicates this may have been a reference to his relinquishing the Sa Ba, “the spirit or soul of all sacred wisdom.” Fascinatingly, the origin of the word sacrifice supports this supposition. Sacrifice comes from sacer , sacred, and facere , to make, and means “the offering of anything to a deity as homage.” 20 Facer means “one who is impudent or brazen.” 21 In the Bible “the one who is brazen” is the healing serpent hoisted upon a pillar by Moses. 22 This ‘worm’ or serpent soul is the object Joseph sought when he asked for the soma, which also means holy blood of the goddess, and is called Saba in Egypt.

THE DOOR OF WISDOM ! Another viewpoint concerning this dead/live body or blood of life question arises from the fact that the word “cross” did not appear in the Bible until after 500 AD. 23 This explains why the “Latin” (Roman) or “Passion” cross, the primary icon or logo of Christianity, did not appear in Christian art until 600 AD either. 24 In the original Greek version of the New Testament the word used for the Pillar upon which Jesus was Crucified was Stau-ros . As we have seen, in Egypt tau was another name for the ankh , the Cross of Life. Ros means wisdom and dew. Amalgamating these word meanings, renders Stau-ros as “the Pillar or Cross of Life or Wisdom,” perfectly aligning it with the concept of the Saba, the Egyptian term for the ‘blood of life’, and soma, the Greek and Hindu soma as the blood of life or wisdom. The lower section of the ankh or Key of Life is a cross. More interestingly, the Key of Life was made from a branch from the Tree of Life that grew in the Garden of Eden. The Church claimed the True Cross was also made of the same wood that grew as the Tree of Life in Eden. 25 Like the Key of Life, Adam conveniently passed the cross along his bloodline for the express purpose of crucifying the Savior (who in this case would be the a~tom) whenever or wherever he appeared.

It was described as the ladder by which souls of the dead made their way to the Fields of Peace (which, coincidentally, were always said to lie to the north, the same direction as Tula.) In the Pyramid Texts, in which the pharaoh’s journey to immortality is described, the two TET pillars are shown on either side of the “Door of Heaven.” The doors remain sealed until the pharaoh utters the word of power. Then, suddenly, the “double doors of heaven open up... the aperture of the celestial windows is open.” And soaring as a great bird, the pharaoh’s Ka has reached the land of the living. In this depiction drawn by a savant in Napoleon’s army from the Temple of H-orus at Edfu in Egypt, fourteen steps on an ascending stairway lead to a pillar topped by a crescent moon cradling the eye of A~tum. This ceremony is supervised or conducted by Thoth who stands on a line that leads into his moon sky-boat or Ark behind him. The Crown of Thorns and the Stau-ros Pillar also aligns the Crucifixion with the Great Pyramid complex in Egypt.

His purpose was to symbolize the synthesis of the two cultures that the new Greek rulers of Egypt hoped would occur. The name Sarapis, says Higgins, comes from Soros or S- Ros the name given by the Egyptians to a (s)tone coffin , and Apis or Opis , the name given to Osiris (which, as we have already seen, is associated with the soul). 29 These two words combined result in Soro-Apis or Sor-Apis , ‘the tomb of the bull’ or ‘the tomb of the soul’. The mysteries of Sarapis explains why the Egyptians would worship a (s)tone or a coffin in the form of a man, and why Henry Wallace was awaiting a sacred casket. The word Stau-ros is not only the mirror-image of Ros-tau, the name of the Giza plateau, but is also an word play for Tauros or Taurus, the Bull. In Hebrew, Sarapis is Saraph , meaning ‘to blaze out’ or ‘to blaze up’. As we have seen, the Seraphim class of angels -- the flying-serpent healers -- derive their name from this word.

The Sarapeum was regarded as one of the wonders of the ancient world. It was named after an earlier famous Sarapeum which once stood in Memphis and which contained a library with over 300,000 volumes. Within the temple was an emerald (s)tatue of Serapis.

If it was the True Cross, we know it was not destined to stay there. It had an appointment with destiny in Jerusalem c. 30 AD for the crucifixion of Jesus. The Cross (aka the symbol of AMOR), or its instruction manual, was then destined to journey to Southern France to Cathar country where a bridge to Heaven or AMOR was soon to be built. Before heading to France, however, this device appears to have been transported to Rome. MITHRAS AND THE DOOR OF WISDOM In Rome the mysteries of the bull were celebrated in March and featured Mithras in the act of killing the bull, the life-force of the Earth that he himself embodied. We have already associated Mithras with Maitreya. Mithras is also often equated with Attis, a fourth-century BC Greek figure who was known as a good shepherd and was called the ‘Green Man’ or the ‘Green One,’ and obvious link with Osiris and Tula. 31 He was depicted with sun-rays or ears of corn emerging from his cap. In rituals he was called ‘ the corn- stalk ’. 32 The Roman rites of his mother Cybele (or Sa-Ba-El) were accompanied by the sacrifice of a bull in a ritual known as the Taurobolium . 33 The cult of Attis strongly influenced early Christianity.

To mark the moment when Attis entered his mother at conception, his 60-foot tall tree-phallus was carried into her sacred cave. 34 His death was celebrated as the Day of Blood.

At the celebration reed-bearers carried phallic- shaped scepters representing the regenerated phalli of the god. The bull and tree of the Taurobolium are, of course, the TET or Pillar of Osiris, the 40 foot tall golden device which housed his soul. As our investigation into the mysteries of the Grail has revealed, it is probably the same as the (s)tone or coffin of Sarapis and the Holy Grail, the container of the ‘blood’ or ‘soul’ of Christ. Inscriptions from the 4 th century proclaimed Attis the Menotyrannus, from Greek tyrannos , “lord,” and Men or Mennu, Osiris as the resurrected moon-bull. 35 From our point of view, he is also the lord of the Nu or the A~tomic Christ. THE TAU ! The Stau-ros ties a Gordian knot between the Pillar of Osiris, the Cross of Christ, the Tau, the Cross of the Druids, and the Tau of the Chinese H-Siens . This is such an extraordinary meeting of the worlds that it is worthy of some explanation. Long before the Greeks, and hundreds of years before Jesus, the tau was adopted by the Druids, the ‘men of the Oak Trees’, who came from Hypberboria, the Greek name for Heaven. At the center of Hyperboria was Tula. The Druids were well known as wise men to the Roman philosophers. As we have noted, scholars have long debated the origin of the word ‘Druid’. Larousse’s World Mythology says it came from daru-vid, meaning ’skilled’. One art in which the Druids were highly skilled was the manufacture of Tau crosses made of oak trees -- the symbolic Tree of Life -- stripped of their branches. Upon the right"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 181 branch they cut in the bark the word Hesus , upon the middle or upright stem the word Taramis , and on the right Belenus . Over this, above the going off arms, they cut the name of God, Thau or Tau . This configuration matches that of the Crucifixion with Jesus accompanied by two thieves and God above. However, it was in use hundreds of years before Jesus. In northern Israel the Druid name Hesus or Jesus was the same as Ieud or Jeud, the “only begotten son” who was dressed in a royal robe and sacrificed. Greek versions of this name were Jason and Iasus, signfiying a healer or therapeutae , a physician of the soul. This matches the story of Jesus who was an Essene therapeutate from the royal House of David and his alleged twin, Tammuz or Thomas. Third century classical scholar, Diogenes Laertius, said the Druids were the cult of the Magi, the sect of the Three Wise Men who sought out the Christ child Jesus. It was Druid prophecy that predicted the arrival of Jesus. Therefore, it would make perfect sense why they sought the blessed child. Druid or Daru-vid is, as we have seen, not that far from David . Rennes-le-Chateau researcher, and expert in the Language of the Birds, Elizabeth van Buren states the true meaning of David is the same as the Welsh Duw or Duvydd . 36 It means God’s messenger . This is a fascinating enlargement of our search for the meaning of the word Druid. God’s messenger is usually depicted as a dove, like the Dove of the Holy Spirit which flew into Jesus’ mouth at his baptism by John the Baptist in the River Jordan. 37 ‘Dove’ (or ‘ Duv ’, which is but Duw ) comes from Oannes, the Babylonian name for E.A., the serpent soul of Sumerian mythology who lived in the Pillar."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 182 The Celtic and Latin word for Dove is colomen, colombe, columba . One excellent example of this name is Christopher Colombus, which means ‘Christ-bearing Dove’. According to Higgins, the I column or pillar was used by the Druid priests, who were known as ‘the Instructors’, to signify the sacred island where the I-Pillar(s) were set up as witnesses to covenants of Peace. 38 Oannes, the serpent soul bird-man, lived within this Pillar. David or Dovydd, with the ‘D’s’ at either end of the name, says Ms. van Buren, also represents Dol or door , that is, a pillar, tower or column reaching to Heaven. In Hebrew, she notes, dohv means bear , which phonetically is the same as bier or coffin . 39 ! THE TOWER ! Some researchers maintain the Druids are named after the Celtic word for “oak,” or duir , phoneticaly door . In Welsh, which is closely related to old Celtic, derw is “oak,” drws is “door“ and dwr is “water.” Fascinatingly, the Pillar of Osiris was also known as the tawer of Osiris. Tawer is an anagram for Water . The letters ‘t’ and the ‘d’ are interchangeable. When we remove the vowels and allow for this interchange the Celtic drw, oak, becomes trw . Likewise, the Druid dwr or water becomes twr , which with the addition of an ‘a’ or ‘o’ becomes tawer and tower. These word plays suggest that, once again, the Tawer or Tower of Osiris, also known as the Pillar of Osiris, is the same as the Pillar of David and possibly the Tower of Babel. This Pillar, of course, was installed in Solomon’s Temple in c . 1,000 B.C."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 183 Had it been returned to the rebuilt Second Temple of Solomon at the time of the Crucifixion of Jesus? Interestingly, the Hebrew root Dud means ‘love, that which unites together’, an apt description of the Stau-ros Pillar. 40 Dud , Duw or Dovydd is also the dew of the alchemists, the elixir of immortality. In many myths the revelation of the dew ( love ) is brought by the Morning Star, an epithet for Jesus who was of the Royal House of David. From our investigation we can see that the term “Royal House of David” may mean either the House of the Dove, the House of the Pillar or the House of the Dew. Its function is to produce the elixir of immortality, the nuclear mother substance . This is precisely what the Bible claims Jesus did at his Crucifixion. This mother substance is the Blue Apples. ! SPLITTING THE VEIL ! In addition to Jesus’ apparent production of this nuclear mother substance , Matthew’s Gospel records two effects of the activity involving the Stau-Ros Pillar at the Crucifixion. The first effect was an earthquake. The second effect was a ‘veil’ within the Holy of Holies of the Temple of Solomon was split in half revealing God’s presence. 41 The Holy of Holies housed the Ark of the Covenant. It was entered on only one day of the year: the Day of Atonement. The veil was not split on any other day. According to the Book of Exodus, 42 this veil was made of blue, purple and scarlet linen. It was made with (or by) angels and it hung from four pillars of wood overlaid with gold. It simultaneously shielded and connected the High Priest with God."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 184 This veil is known as the veil or gate revealed by the Apocalypse (Greek for ‘uncovering’, from the root apo , far away, and kalyptein , to uncover) 43 in the book of Revelation. When we view these word fossils as a whole it seems Jesus had a powerful linguistic connection with the ancient Druids and some kind of apocalyptic Pillar which split open a gate to God, creating a moment of Peace in which God was revealed from ‘far away’. Joseph of Arimathea’s request for the soma, the blood of life (or wisdom of the blood of life) suggests a link with the Greek mysteries and the Hindu mysteries of which the Druids were masters. He appears to be asking for the mother substance from the Stau-ros, the Druid Pillar of Wisdom that opens a water door that connect Heaven and Earth via wormhole. This secret may not be the body of Jesus, but something -- the definition of soma suggests either blood or a wise soul -- which came from within it. In fact, Christ crowned with ( t)horns is sometimes depicted casting rays of Christ Light (like the symbolic horns of Moses). As noted, the word crucifixion comes from crux or crucis , a cross, and figere , to fasten. Not only was the Son, Jesus, fastened or connected to a pillar (through the crown), but also the process of Crucifixion fastened, fused or connected him to a higher or inner source of Light. This is symbolized in Christian art by a halo of sunlight around his head. This Christ Light was pulled from ‘far in the universe’ and ‘crucified’ by Jesus. In absence of the ability to directly study this actual Pillar of Wisdom, we are left with continuing to follow the stories of those who were connected with its Light.

His request for the secret mother substance may also explain why the Gospels offer so few details concerning him.

THE COAT OF MANY COLORS ! The Gospels record that Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Sanhedrin, the council of Jewish Elders who ruled Jewish affairs in Jerusalem. Flavius Josephus, a contemporary historian, recorded that Joseph was a wealthy tin trader. 1 Flavius traced his activities as far away as the British Isles. His nephew, according to legend, accompanied him on several of these trips during his so-called ‘missing years’ between boyhood and his reappearance in Jerusalem. As a secret disciple of Jesus, 2 Joseph’s deepest ambition, more than making money, was to help the young man whose life’s mission revolved around saving the world. Christian myths say that after the Crucifixion Joseph traveled to England with a flowering rod and the Holy Grail containing the Holy Blood (the soma) which he deposited at Glastonbury Tor, perpetuating his nephew’s mission. Who is this double agent, Joseph of Arimathea, and what is this flowering rod? It is widely claimed that Joseph was a title rather than a first name. Joseph of Arimathea or AMOR- thea literally means “a Joseph belonging to the Goddess- mother Ari or Mari,” the goddess whose story we looked at a moment ago. Yet another Joseph who shared this title and was associated with a flower(ing) rod was the husband of Jesus’"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 187 mother, Mary. The Christian legend of Joseph’s flower rod said he was chosen to be Mary’s husband out of group of suitors by a symbolic test of fertility. All candidates laid their (phallic) rods on the (female-symbolic) altar. Joseph’s rod burst into bloom. The sacred dove came down and perched on Joseph’s rod, signifying the Goddess accepted him. 3 The same dove appeared over the head of Jesus at his baptism as a symbol for wisdom and the Holy Spirit. Like Jesus’ father Joseph, the French History of the Grail claims the aged Joseph of Arimathea was the father to a son who was born by divine intervention: Galahad, the last pure knight of the Holy Grail. Galahad was born to Joseph and his beloved Galaad, whose name is strikingly similar to the biblical Gilead, which with the addition of an ‘h’ becomes Galahad. Still another story is that of Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors ( c. 1800 B.C.). Joseph was placed in the Pit where an ‘ evil beast devoured him’ . 4 Does this story sound familiar? After Reuben pleaded for Joseph’s life, the Egyptians stripped Joseph of his Coat of Many Colors that was on him, and they took him and cast him in the Pit: and the Pit was empty, there was no water in it.” According to Barbara Walker, 5 Joseph earned the Coat of Many Colors before he went into the Pit of Abaton. ! ! SCALA DEI ! After his initiation in the Pit Joseph was given the name Scalit . 6 Scalit means ‘wise man‘ and comes from slt , assistant to the High Priest. 7 Fascinatingly, Scala means a ladder or flight of steps. 8 Lit means light or to illuminate."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 188 We have already encountered this term in Scala Dei , meaning “Ladder to God,” as another name for the Cross. Modern physicists have resurrected this word for use in describing energy as Scalar energy, i.e. shaped like a spiral ladder. Joseph’s father Jacob laid his head on a stone and dreams he sees a ladder reaching into Heaven. 9 Was this a scalar or spiral ladder of light? Did it emerge from an unspecified Pit? Why is this scene so eerily reminiscent of the Davenport Stele found in Iowa and depicting a spiral tube emerging from a ladder? In Jacob’s story, which runs through six chapters of the Genesis, he sees a fiery image at the top of the ladder. On the right and left of each of the ladder’s twelve steps he sees a statue or bust of a man. Angels are ascending and descending this ladder. From atop the ladder God calls to Jacob. He promises that the land on which he is sleeping will be his and that his descendents shall be blessed . 10 Tracing the word scalit backward, as did Godfrey Higgins, we learn the root sclt comes from saca, which is the same as the Hebrew word ske , imaginari, and scio , to contemplate.

This word fossil, Skilly, resurfaced in Britain as a name for the Blessed Isles , the surviving islands of Atlantis in British lore. Atlantis was also known as Ultima Thule . This is the same name as the Druid homeland, suggesting the Druids may have carried the seed name Skilly to England and planted it in the ground there.

To others the Skilly’s are the home port of “the people of the sea,” traders and pirates who came here long ago. The poet Alfred Tennyson lived here when he wrote “The Idylls of the King” in which he brought Camelot to life. ! THE ATON-TULA CONNECTION ! The Pit of Abaton (or Pit of Aton) has a remarkable connection with Tula, Thule, Atlantis and hence, the Druids. It was said Thales , who speculated on the nature of the atom, received his intellectual skills from communion with the Goddess of Wisdom in an Ab-aton, the Greek word for Pit. 14 The Sanskrit word for pit is tal , an anagram for tla or Tula. Interestingly: • Ab is the Egyptian word for the heart-soul received from the mother. 15 • Ab is also the Latin version of apo , and the English of , and denotes from, away or down from. 16 • Aton is the Egyptian name for ‘Disk’ and for the Central Sun. These definitions render the Pit of Ab-Aton as “Heart-soul of, or down from, Aton.” In other words, Ab-Aton is the heart-soul of the Central Sun, Tula. Apo is the root for hope: a desire for good. 17 Apo-theosis refers to deification, or the act of making a god of a person. 18 Apo-theosize means to elevate"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 191 to the place of god. 19 As we can see, a clear picture of the purpose of this Pit of Abatton emerges: it is a womb of transformation that brings the Heart or Core of Tula to Earth or elevates one to the Heart or Core of Tula. In the ancient world the Heart of Aton was a place on Earth: Heliopolis, the City of the Sun in Egypt. Here, the wise heron gave advice. Here, the Old Testament Joseph earned his “coat of many colors” by undergoing a death and resurrection ceremony in the Pit. 20 Here, Jesus was taken during the flight from Egypt immediately after his birth. 21 It may be said that those who put on the royal coat and experience the Pit of Abatton are a part of a project linking man and Aton, a Man-Aton project. ! THE CLOAK AND THE PALLADIUM ! Joseph’s Coat of Many Colors returns us to the robe or cloak worn by Jesus enroute to the Crucifixion. Mark’s Gospel says Jesus’ robe was purple 22 and Matthew’s says it was scarlet. 23 Are both talking about the Scalit or Skilly robe of many colors? The ancients’ “royal purple” was not purple but a dark wine red, the color of blood. Royal purple meant the same thing as royal blood. When Jesus put on the robe along with the crown of the hare it seems to have given him the wise blood of the gods and the ability to ‘go far into the universe’. Our earlier brief introduction to the story of Mari and the Palladium Pillar brings additional insight into cloak of Jesus. In order to appreciate this connection it is necessary to inject a few words from Flavia Anderson at this time about the Druid legend of the serpent’s eggs, the blue stones at Mari’s neck."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 192 The serpent’s egg, says Anderson, was known to be a famous talisman of the Druids and appeared in effigy at Serpent’s Mound, Ohio. Pliny gives an astonishing description of how the serpent’s eggs were made. The serpents (Druid instructors) meet on a certain day of the moon. They twist themselves into many convultions and hiss, and their saliva form a bubble like a ring above the head of one of them, which the rest blow on till it comes off at the tail. 24 Let us imagine that the above is a description of the golden Palladium Pillar in use. The tip-off that it is the Pillar being described comes from Pliny, who says that even though set in gold (even though encased in the golden Pillar) the egg will float. As it comes from the tail of the serpent, the egg must be caught in mid-air into a cloak . 25 According to Higgins, 27 when a person was admitted to the highest Druid degrees, he received the Pallium or sacred cloak made of white lamb’s wool (the symbol of wisdom) to convey humility and authority. The white lamb’s wool is the Golden Fleece. This reveals the Palllium is probably the same as the PALA ruler’s garment worn by Inanna at Mari. From these early days it was passed along from initiate to initiate, until it reached Jerusalem in the time of Jesus. It is easy to think that the above lines about the Druid cloak holding the serpent means that the wearer of the Cloak of Many Colors is the healing god or Great Physician, the serpent holder who is continuously reincarnating. The cloak wearers were related to the Therapeutae , or Physicians of the Soul. This is our link to Jesus, who was an Essene Therapeutae."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 193 The Therapeutae are now thought to have been originated by E.A./Enki the first smith, and to have included Akhenaton and his followers who were representatives of his Aton religion. As we have seen, Aton is another name for Tula. Aton is also phonetically similar to Adon, or Adonis, the Lord. Once again, we have stumbled upon linguistic evidence linking Akhenaton/Moses and Jesus with Tula. Could the fact that both of these teachers ‘held or lifted the serpent’, which we may actually be a ‘soul’, explain why the ancient Yesedes of Iraq thought (apparently mistakenly) that Moses, Jesus and Mohammed worshipped the Devil, who is more closely associated with the serpent? Did they not realize certain souls are serpent-shaped? And that instead of holding a demonic creature they were ‘holding‘ the soul of a profound and powerful teacher? ! ELIJAH ! Another claimant to this cloak was Elijah. When Elijah left his prophetic power to Elisha , 27 he conferred it on him or installed him in his office, by the investiture of the Cloak, or the Pallium . Jesus stated that John the Baptist was the reincarnated Elijah. Given that Elijah conferred the royal Pallium Cloak to Elisha it is possible that this Cloak was passed along until the time of John when Elijah/John the Baptist reincarnated and reacquired it. Joshua, Joseph of the Coat of Many Colors, and Joseph of Arimathea are other Biblical figures who possessed this Cloak."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 194 Is there something fishy going on here? Did the ancient priests, the Doves who tended the I Pillar of Peace, wear this cloak while conducting the Crucifixion ceremony? Was this the royal robe the fish skin of the Fisher Kings? Was this the robe Roman centurions rolled the dice to acquire? If so, what became of this Pillar and the related power tools, i.e. the fish suit? I have endeavored to show that, if we look, history is replete with answers to these questions. When St. Augustin came to England he brought with him the holy sacred dress, called, in Latin Amphibolus . This word obviously refers to some form of amphibious or fish-like attire. According to Webster’s , 28 the word amphibian has numerous provocative levels of meaning, including: • a reptile or a plant that lives and grows either on land or in water, • a person or thing of double or doubtful nature, and • a tank or vehicle that can travel on either land or water. Fascinatingly, an amphibia fossil is called an amphibiolite from amphi and bios , life, and lithos , stone. Godfrey Higgins believed the Pallium was the remnant of an ancient superstition, the original meaning of which has probably been forgotten. If only Higgins could have shared in the discovery of The Goddess With a Vase Statue . Then he would have known that the original meaning of the Cloak and the Pillar were not forgotten. !"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 195 ELIJAH AND ATON ! One question must be answered before continuing. Where did Elijah (in 800 BC) get the Pallium garment, which is also known as his “mantle“? The answer is found exactly where common sense tells us it should be, in the history of Akhenaton and A-ton. As Ahmed Osman so concisely states, 29 after Akhenaton’s usurpation of their power the Amun (source of ‘Amen’) priests launched a counter offensive. This escalating battle threatened to get out of hand. To restore order Akhenaton was forced to appoint his brother, Semenkhkare, who was only about 20 at the time, as his co-regent at Thebes. This action cooled things down but only temporarily. Rumors in the royal court turned into actual fact: a rebellion was underway. The Amun priesthood, now in control of the army, wanted Akhenaton’s head on a platter. With Egypt divided between Amen and A-ton, Aye ( Aya or E.A .) Akhenaton’s minister and uncle proposed a compromise -- allow the old gods to be worshipped along with Aton. Akhenaton refused. He and Nefertiti were forced to abdicate the throne and flee for their lives. Along with a small group of followers and taking with him the symbol of his authority -- the Key of Life -- Akhenaton and Nefertiti disappeared into the Sinai Peninsula. Akhenaton’s successor, Semenkhkare, was murdered within a few days, and was succeeded by Akhenaton and Nefertiti’s young son, Tutankhaten . As evidenced by the symbol of Tula on the back of his throne seat found in his tomb in the Valley of the Kings, the new Pharaoh worshipped Aton as did his father. As a compromise with the Amen"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 196 priests, he reopened the ancient temples and legalized the worship and patronage of the ancient gods. As a final act of peace he changed his name to Tutankhamun recognizing Amun as the State god. According to Ahmad Osman, 30 Tutankhamun traveled to the Sinai to meet his father to try to persuade Akhenaton and his followers to return to Egypt and live there in peace. The primary condition was that they had to accept the idea that the gods of Amen could become angels who could help the Egyptians become closer with God. Akhenaton refused. Tutankhamun was tortured and hanged by the Amun priest Panehesy, on the eve of Passover in April for betraying the religious beliefs of the Amen priesthood. Interestingly, Osman makes a very compelling case that the figures playing out this ancient Egyptian drama are actually: • Moses (Akhenaton), • Joseph of Arimathea (Aye, Akhenaton/Moses’ uncle), • Solomon (Akhenaton’s father), • Mary (Nefertiti), and • Jesus (Tutankhamun). If, indeed, Solomon was Akhenaton’s father, or even his relative, would this be the answer for where Moses/Akhenaton learned the alphabet previous to his encounter with the Lord on Sinai? Did he get it from his father, who had been taught this Language by God or by the father of the Queen of Saba? If Tutankhamun is Jesus, this would explain the inexplicable statement in Revelation quoted above which explicitly states Jesus was (once?) crucified in Sodom and in Egypt (as Tutankhamun).

In addition, it would explain why, shortly after his death, Jesus, along with three disciples, met Moses and Elijah on ‘Mount Sinai’. In Sunday School we are led to believe this was a symbolic meeting. In light of this hypothesis, the meeting of Moses (Akhenator) and Jesus (Tutankhamun) becomes an actual meeting of father and son. Elijah, who never died, but was carried to have in a “whirlwind“ came to joint him. In answer to our present question of where Elijah acquired the Joseph’s --E.A’.s -- Coat of Many Colors, the answer appears to be he got it from Akhenaton."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 198 12. THE GREAT SKILL ! There is another powerful connection between the stories of Mari, Joseph and Jesus. The link is Skilly Pit of Ab-aton. The Gospel of Luke says Jesus’ father Joseph (E.A.) was a son of Hel. 1 This is strange. In Judeo-Christian terminology Hell is a place to be avoided at all costs. Originally, however, Hel was the goddess’ fiery furnace or womb of transformation; a place where men were transformed into gods. 2 The Book of Revelation 3 calls Hel the Pit of Abaddon or Ab-atton , the home of Apollo, the serpent-deity, who periodically returned to Tula to gather sacred knowledge. Significantly, the meaning of the Egyptian word ab , the heart- soul that came from the Mother Goddess, was reversed in Hebrew; ab was redefined as “father.” Hel was also the Greek word for the Sun. The Greeks called themselves Hellenes meaning “chidlren of the Sun.” Today we have the words heliocentric (to be measured from the sun’s center), helix , the spirals of human DNA. ! In the feminine Gnostic tradition, Mary’s husband Joseph was a carpenter who assembled the Pillar upon which Jesus was crucified. The feminine teachings relative to the heart- soul of the Pit of Abatton were suppressed, as were the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 199 Joseph’s secrets of the Pillar. They were not, however, completely erased. References to the feminine teachings appear in veiled form throughout the Gospels and in Christian tradition. For example, Jesus spent his three days between Crucifixion and resurrection in Joseph’s tomb. 4 Some Christians believe Jesus spent these three days fighting demons in Hell. If we follow the linguistic lead suggesting that Hell is the same as the Pit of Abatton, the womb of transformation of the goddess, and investigate this Pit’s possible role in the Crucifixion, we find strange and persistent legends linking the family of Jesus to this Pit. Rather than a tomb, Jesus would have spent three days in a womb of transformation. One result of this process was the soma, the wise blood. SKILL ! As we have seen, the word Druid means ‘skilled’. The etymology of this word suggests that when Joseph went into the Abatton Pit he emerged with skill or wisdom, hence the name Skill or Skilly. If Jesus entered this Pit, or wormhole, as I have proposed, then we should be able to find evidence of this in the linguistic record. In Godseed: The Journey of Christ , 5 Dr. Jean Houston presents what I consider a major revelation when she notes that Christos and Chrestos were interchangeable terms to the early Christians. Chrestos means simpleton, great silly or blessed one . She says that, in one of the apocryphal traditions, Pontius Pilate is supposed to have said to Jesus upon the Pillar, “ Ain Chrestos !” or “You are the great silly.” 6"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 200 When the interchangeability between silly and skilly, both words mean “blessed,” is taken into account, might Pilate have meant to say, “You are the great Chrestos or Skilly?” Did this mean “You are the Druid of great wisdom!“ or “You are the great Blessed One!?” Paul affirms this notion that Jesus is the incarnation of the divine Wisdom when he says, “he is the power and the wisdom of God.” 7 In John 10:19 Jesus said: ! “I am the door . If anyone enters through Me , he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.” ! In the mythological Language of the Birds (Bards) duir and door are phonetically similar in English, and therefore, interchangeable. As duir means ‘druid’, in this case Jesus is saying, “I am the Druid.” In Mark 14:61-62, at his trial Jesus is asked directly by the high priest and Sanhedrin, “Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed (‘skill’)?” Jesus’ reply was equally direct. “I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” With that the charge of blasphemy against Jesus was affirmed. Recalling that Mount Meru was the home of the Blessed Ones, we may safely assume these Blessed Ones, the people of Saba or ‘wise blood’, were the Druids or the Daruvids, the People of the Pillar. The name Scala Dei , Ladder of God, was given to this Pillar as a reference to its owner, who was called Skilly, Blessed One. !"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 201 ESCUELE/SKILL ! Skilly is the linguistic key that links us to evidence of the Druid involvement in the Crucfixion. Skilly is also the key that ties Jesus’ attire at the Crucifixion with the coat, hat and other garments worn by Mari when she went ‘far into the universe’. There is additional evidence for the use of Skilly as the word to describe Jesus. According to Grail historian Andrew Sinclair, in the French History of the Grail the cup, dish or platter used to collect the transformed Blood of Christ on the Pillar was called the escuele (pronounced ‘s kool ’, ‘s kiel ’ or ‘s kill ’). 8 In its Christian dimension the escuele is the Holy Grail -- the mystic receptacle used by Christ to perform the Eucharist at the Last Supper when he poured wine for the disciples to drink, saying, “this is my blood.” The next day the escuele appeared at the Crucifixion with Joseph of Arimathea or Mary Magdalene as the Grail-bearer. Sinclair claims the History was the first description of the Grail as the literal Word or Name of God. 9 The History makes it clear that this Name or title was not Jesus Christ. It was Escuele , ‘skill’ or ‘Scill(y)’. The Grail heresy further states that, after the Crucifixion, a few drops of the blood of life (soma or Sa Ba) spilled out of Jesus’ body while Joseph tended his wounds. Joseph collected these drops in the escuele and took them to Glastonbury Tor in England. If Skill is the actual (Druid) Name or title of Christos, it makes perfect sense why the escuele (skill) receptacle in which Joseph collected the Holy Blood was so named. It too referred to its owner. This is akin to a doctor labeling a vial containing a blood sample with a patient’s"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 202 name. The vial containing the blood of the patient shares the name of the patient because they are the same. In this case, the flowering rod of Joseph is the blood of Christ. Flowers and the word Skill(y) strangely go together. For example, near Mexico City there is a “lake of flowers” where “xochil or socheel (‘skeel’),” the Aztec word for flowers, are sold. 10 The Skilly/Jesus connection may explain why. Tula, the name of the sacred city of the Druids, is located near Mexico City. It is the sacred name for Atlantis. The Hopi, who are descendents of the Aztecs of Mexico City tell of the white teacher Massau or Messiah and Tula. Petroglyphs from Eagar, Arizona show possible Massau figures. He is shown as a skull (skill) like figure including a triangular V nose and gnashing teeth (symbolizing ‘tooth’ or ‘thoth’). ! THE DRUID UNIVERSITY AT GLASTONBURY TOR ! Understanding that escuele is the blood of life (or the wise soul of Sa Ba) explains why it was taken to Glastonbury Tor. Today Glastonbury Tor is a popular tourist attraction. In Jesus’ time it was counted along with Salisbury (near Stonehenge), Bristol, Bath and Dorchester as principle Druid centers of learning. They contained as many as 60,000 students who represented the nobility of the country. It required over 20 years to complete the rigorous academic curriculum of Druidic knowledge, which included philosophy, astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, jurisprudence, medicine, poetry and oratory. 11 It is claimed that Jesus studied at a Druid university at Glastonbury. 12 When he arrived it was evident that he was a Druid. During this time he worked part-time in his uncle’s tin"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 203 mines. Even into the 20th century miners and tinners of this area chant and sing a song that contains the words: “Jesus was in the trade.” I have already pointed out the correspondences between the Druidic Tau cross and the Christian (S)tau-ros Pillar and how the coming savior was identified as Yesus hundreds of years before the time of Jesus. The more Druidism is studied the more obvious is its relationship to the teachings of Jesus. This may explain why the Druids so quickly accepted Jesus into their inner mysteries and why Joseph of Arimathea chose Glastonbury Tor as the place to store the ‘blood of life’. One reason most Christians may not have previously considered the connection between Jesus and the Druids is that the Roman political machine viewed Druidism as one of its greatest threats. It was largely wiped out by emperors Augustus, the founder of the Roman empire and its sole ruler from 31 B.C. to A.D. 14, and Tiberius both Caesars who outlawed the religion of the Druids, delcaring its practice a treasonous offense. Tiberius was the Caesar mentioned by Jesus in response to a question about taxes. Jesus held up a Roman coin, saying, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” 13 Tiberius’ profile was stamped on the coins. His 23 year reign (A.D. 14-37) spanned the entire ministry of Jesus. Tiberius’ rule has fixed the date that John the Baptist began his ministry: “in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar” 14 or A.D. 29. During that reign, Tiberius appointed Pontius Pilate as governor of Judea. The Roman invasions of Britain by Julius Caesar (whose assassination catapulted Augustus to the throne at the age of 19) and Emperor Claudius (who ruled from A.D. 41 to 54)"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 204 were largely designed to exterminate the Druids. These religious purists had long been rivals of Rome’s desire to control the minds of its people. Claudius also persecuted the Jews. The Book of Acts says, “Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome.” 15 He forbade them to hold religious meetings. A Roman historian, Seutonius (c. 69-140) wrote that, “the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus , so Claudius expelled them from Rome.” Seutonius appears to be stating that the Blessed One, Chrestus /Skilly, was alive and well and stirring up trouble in Rome in A.D. 49! Aquila and Prisca, two Jewish tent makers accompanied him. After their banishment from Rome they went to Corinth and lived and worked with the apostle Paul. ! ESCHOL ! Once apprehended, my “Jesus is the Druid Skilly” hypothesis finds immense support in the Bible. The most amazing parts of this evidence are linked to what blatantly appear to be stargate stories. The key word fossil to reference is Escuele and words of a similar resonance. Another word is wood and its usage in reference to Jesus as a poor carpenter. If we make the small adjustment from Jesus as a wood worker to a word worker it would begin to align us with the skilled word worker Jesus who matches Dead Sea Scroll scholar Geza Verme’s ‘carpenter’, which, he says, stands for ‘scholar’ in certain Talmudic sayings. Obviously, skill and scholar are not that far apart. For example, in the Old Testament we find the word Eschol . 16"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 205 Like escuele, when we remove the vowels from Eschol we are left with schl or skl , both phonetically sk-il. Bearing in mind that once vowels are added they are interchangeable, might we render Eschol as Eschil or E-Skill? Remember Eschol? This word fossil appears fourteen hundred years before Jesus in the Old Testament book of Numbers 13:21 as the name of the outpost of the Anunnaki (“the Tula boys”). The valley of Eschol, Joshua declared, “eateth the people up!” Might this description equally suggest a pit or stargate of some kind? Given that Joshua was the grandson of Joseph could this people-eating angelic outpost have housed the transformative Pit of Abatton which ‘devoured’ both Joseph and Jesus and transformed them into a Skilly? Did Joshua son of Nun, the Old Testament Jesus, undergo a similar nuclear experience? Once ‘crushed’, the ‘grapes or Blue Apples of Eschol’ became the wine of the Eucharist, the blood of Chrestus (which is the Blood of Skill or the Wise Blood), used by Jesus as the Last Supper and caught in the escuele. The Eschol-Skill connection reinforces the idea that these grapes would have played a vital role in Jesus’ journey into the Pit of Abatton during the Crucifixion. At Rennes-le-Chateau, located in the wine country of Southern France, these grapes of Skill are called the Blue Apples and are the logo for the Grail heresy. They represent the secret of immortality. They are the ‘blue stones’, or the Druid ’serpents eggs’ that turn an ordinary person into a Shining One. !"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 206 SKULL ! Another key biblical word resonant with Escuele or Skill is skull (or skll with the ‘u’ removed). Accurate or not, Jesus is widely believed to have been crucified at Golgotha, the Place of the Skull -- or Skill. The Knights Templar, who claimed to guard the secrets of Christ, said they possessed, and worshipped, the head or skull of God that they called sophia or ‘wisdom’, which is the same definition as skill. No one can say for certain what this skull is or where the Place of the Skull where Jesus was crucified is located. The overwhelming weight of Christian history says it was somewhere in Jerusalem. Linguistic evidence I have presented says it was the Great Pyramid. Might “the Place of the Skull,” and the Templar skull of God or wisdom, both actually be a reference to the Son of God’s name: Skull or Skill(y) and also the location of the Pit of Abatton which transforms a man into a Druid Skill, a wise man? Incredibly, there is a pit beneath the Great Pyramid. Up until Vatican II each day the Roman Church called upon Jesus the Father and the Master of the Ages to come: Jesus pater futuri SAECULI Because of the nature of the secrets of the Skull of God the Church massacred the Templars. Was this secret the real Name of God?

Who cares? After all, what difference does it make if the Son of God’s real name is Jesus or Skill(y) or if the Crucifxion was the opening of a stargate so long as the result of his life is the same? There may be a world of difference. If the real name of Jesus (or its Druid origins) was switched, obscured, or kept secret altogether (largely to support Roman political purposes), then why not other crucial parts of his story, including details about the Crucifixion? Or what about special knowledge that Jesus brought forth that could benefit humanity or aid individuals on their path to ascension? In other words, where’s the stargate secrets? FROM WITHIN OUTWARDS ! As we have noted, the Grail conceals the mystery for transmuting, fashioning or forming matter. Grouped together, these definitions force a question: was the Crucifixion an event designed to bring the Christ Light from the core of Tula to Earth, the secret of transmuting matter? Was the Stau-ros Pillar, the Pillar of Love, the device which enabled this transmutation? The ladder symbolism brings us back to the central goal of the Grail mysteries: how to find the gate to Heaven and transform ourselves into a being capable of entering this gate.

Scientists have recently concluded we only perceive ten percent of the universe. 14 The rest is “dark,” invisible to humans. Our purpose is to open our spiritual vision to see into this darkness. What is our reward for developing such vision? The Biblical version of opening our sacred vision is described by Isaiah: “For look, I am going to create new heavens and a new Earth, and the past will not be remembered.” 15 Jesus taught the reality of this new Heaven and Earth when he described himself as a Good Shepherd who alone could lead the sheep out of their fold."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 209 When we acquire our H we will perceive a new reality and hence see or have the power to create a new Heaven and a new Earth.

If anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.” ! As we have seen, the key to decoding the esoteric meaning of Jesus as the “door” is found in the Sabala and the Emerald (S)tones of Thoth. The bulk of the myths used to explain this process of climbing the Ladder to Heaven are derived from Sumerian, Egyptian, Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian myth. Properly understood, these myths describe the step-by-step procedures for increasing awareness, love , and attaining enlightenment, revelation . These procedures were artfully and intentionally disguised using figurative terminology so as to be transparent to all but the initiated.

ROSSLYN In order to prove my Blue Apples theory we must visit another place of enormous mystery: Rosslyn Chapel. Tucked away in the magical countryside near Edinburgh, Scotland, Rosslyn has been called a rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon. As we take this journey, we will see that Rennes and Rosslyn are sister cities... and a whole lot more. In that mystical and devout age of 700 AD a Scottish Saint named William St Clair lived in a cell near a well whose healing waters could cure eye troubles. 1 Saint-Clair is derived from the Latin Sanctus Clarus , meaning ‘Holy Light’. Saint Clair is always associated with healing waters, suggesting the healing waters and holy light are one and the same. He was later beheaded for condemning the sins of a local lady. Seven hundred years later his namesake William St Clair would be the guardian or cupbearer of a piece of the True Cross of Jesus which had come into the possession of the English Queen Margaret. 2 He may have been chosen for the fact that the St Clair family had a Templar connection going back to the 11th century. 3 When Margaret’s husband, King Malcolm the Third, defeated and killed Macbeth, he moved the family to Scotland, bringing the True Cross with him. The Royal family had already possessed the Stone of Destiny. Suddenly, William found himself guardian of two of"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 211 the most powerful relics in all of history: a piece of the True Cross, the symbol of the Holy Blood, and the ( S)tone of Destiny, the key-stone to the Temple of Solomon. In return, the St Clair family was given as their symbol on their shield the Engrailed Cross. ST. CATHERINE’S BLOOD Near Edinburgh, in the lands called Roslin , was located a healing well. Queen Margaret was said to have started these healing waters flowing when she poured into it a vial of St. Catherine’s blood from her monastery on Mount Sinai. 4 Catharine was the namesake of the Cathars and the dancer of the fiery wheel at the central point in Heaven 5 -- Tula --who was brought to Earth by Sir Galahad, the last pure knight to possess the Grail. Although she was thought to have lived shortly after the time of Constantine the Great, the man who gave us modern Christianity, her story was never recorded until the 9th century. In the 15th century attempts were made to banish her from the pantheon of saints on the grounds that she was pagan. 6 According to legend, she was the daughter of a Pharaoh who remained a virgin, converted to Christianity and married Christ, receiving from him the mystical ring of his marriage. 7 In receiving this ‘ring’ she sounds an awful lot like Mary Magdalene whom the Templars claimed received Jesus’ Key of Life. It appears likely Margaret (‘Maggie’) and William were preserving secret, if not officially forbidden, knowledge. Margaret ordered a chapel built over the well. 8 William St Clair was knighted and given the lands of Roslin. Now, in"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 212 addition to the Holy Blood and the Stone of Destiny, William also became guardian of the fountain of healing waters or wisdom from the well of his namesake Saint Clair. William St Clair was later brutally killed in battle. Before his death he had married and his wife and given him a son, Henry. So began a remarkable unbroken chain of male inheritance and the legacy of the Lords of Roslin, the guardians of the Holy Blood and the Holy Light. 9 The Saint Clair family built a castle at Roslin, named after the two Celtic words, Ros , meaning a ‘promontory’, and lin , meaning a ‘waterfall’, although later members of the family saw Ros as meaning ‘red’ or ‘rose’ and Roslin as signifying the Blood of Christ, or the Holy Blood. 10 From our search, we have learned ras or ros means wisdom. As such, could it be that the term ‘roslin’ means the St. Clairs were also the guardians of the fountain of wisdom pertaining specifically to the Holy Blood, the Holy Grail and the Holy Light? ROSSLYN CHAPEL Rosslyn Chapel is called a rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon. It was designed by William St Clair over a fifty year period beginning c. 1434 AD. The first shovel hit the ground in 1441, with the first four years being taken to dig the foundation. It is astonishing so much time would be spent on the foundation since the building is of such cozy dimensions. William died in 1484, two years before Rosslyn’s completion. Before his death he supervised the creation of each of the thousands of carvings within the structure. Every carving, from the stars sprinkled across the ceiling to the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 213 pyramids and images of Moses were first modeled in wood for his approval before being carved in stone. William hired some of Europe’s finest master craftsmen who carved within Rosslyn’s luxuriant friezes and decorative stone carvings plants and leaves and flowers. Included are American plants such as maize and aloe cactus. These plants should have been unknown to St Clair. Colombus did not discover America until 1492, six years after Rosslyn had been completed, American plants and all. Dozens of miniature Temples of Solomon also dot the wall. Most prevelant at Rosslyn is the visage of the Green Man. His face appears over 100 times. It could be called his ‘chapel’, but this is not to say it was a church. There is some doubt as to whether it was consecrated as a Christian building until 1862. If not a chapel, then what is Rosslyn? The answer assuredly revolves around the fact that Rosslyn has the original nine knights of the Grail buried in its vaults. It has been suggested it was constructed as a tomb or shrine to house their bodies. This would make Rosslyn a Grail Castle. The Grail connection is undeniable. William St Clair’s tombstone was recently discovered in Rosslyn Chapel. On his tomb is found the Holy Grail and the Rosy Cross. At the base of the Grail is a depiction of the steps of the Temple of Solomon. The original nine French knights who founded the Knights Templar excavated the site of Solomon’s Temple in 1,118 AD. They are believed to have discovered some facet of the treasure of the Temple, possibly including the Language of the Birds.

In the centuries following its completion Chartres received massive attention. In 1307 the Templar Order was destroyed. Thousands of the Order’s members were executed. Hundreds went into hiding. St Clair quietly constructed Rosslyn as the final resting place for the original nine Templars. Her secrets were forbidden to all but the initiated. William St Clair is a man of many M-Istic revelations. What does one expect from a man who was titled ‘the Knight of the Cockle and Golden Fleece’ ? 11 He would perfectly well understand John the Baptist baptizing Jesus with a silvery cockle-shell, wouldn’t he?

The Rose-Cross is associated with Jesus. However, it is much older than him. Sir Laurence Gardner dates it to the time of Moses and the Pharaoh Tuthmosis III (c. 1468-1436 B.C.). 13 Pythagoras (600 B.C.) and Plato (400 B.C.) picked up this golden thread which wound its way into the thinking of the Therapeutae , the powerful cult of healers who lived in Qumran at the beginning of the Age of Pisces. What was the source of the healing powers of these varied individuals and groups? THE TRUE CROSS As the guardian of a piece of the True Cross, William St Clair appears to have guarded the Key of Life, which is the same as the 'ring of Solomon', and the key stone or (S)tone of Destiny. A review is in order here. The True Cross was made from the same ever-green wood as the Tree of Life. The Egyptian name for the Tree of Life was the TET pillar , a ladder to heaven, sacred to Osiris and Horus. This ‘ladder’ is a symbol of that which must be ascended in order to reach Tula. It was described as the ladder by which souls of the dead made their way to the Fields of Peace (which, coincidentally, were always said to lie to the north, the same direction as Tula.) The ladder concept appears in between the time of Horus and Jesus in the story of Jacob’s Ladder. By this rendering, Jesus’ agony in the garden may not be a physical mutilation. Instead, it would mean soul travel to an otherworldly locality, Tula."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 216 According to Godfrey Higgins, “Nazareth, the town of Nazir, or the flower , was situated in Carmel, the vineyard or garden of God. Jesus was a flower; whence came the adoration, by the Rosicrucians, of the Rose and the Cross. Rose was Ras , and this Ras, or knowledge or wisdom, was stolen from the garden. If the Cross is the Pillar of Enoch, the Great Pyramid, this would help us understand an intriguing Rosicrucian symbol -- Jesus within the Rose within a cross within the Pyramid. Jesus is depicted with his hands extended as the capstone of the pyramid. This suggests a connection between the Templars, the Cathars, Rosslyn, Rennes-le-Chateau, the mysterious Language of the Birds, and ... Egypt. The link is the Old Testament prophet Enoch, who was known to the Egyptians as Thoth, the Bird Man. It was Thoth who wielded the Key of Life. ENOCH’S PILLARS In Scottish Freemasonry, which began at the dawn of the fourteenth century, Enoch (who is equated with Thoth) is credited with giving humanity the secrets of books and writing. He gave the secrets of building only to the Freemasons. According to legend, Enoch was warned of the coming deluge. With the help of his son Methuselah, he constructed nine vaults one on top another in a hidden location. 14 Concealed within the lowest vault Enoch placed a gold triangular tablet (a ‘white oriental porphyry stone’ in one version) bearing the Ineffable Name of God -- the Word"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 217 which grants one control over all the elements. This tablet is the (S)tone of Destiny. In her book The Glastonbury Zodiac , Mary Caine relates a Jewish legend of the Middle Ages that shows a clear belief in a relationship between Jesus and the Sphinx. She writes: “ The Hidden Name was secretly inscribed in the innermost recesses of the Temple, guarded by a sculptured lion .” The Temple, guarded by the sculptured lion, can be none other than the Great Pyramid. “ If, as was most likely, an intruder saw the name, the lion would give such a supernatural roar that all memory of it would be driven from his mind. But Jesus knew this; he evaded the lion, wrote the Name, cut his thigh open and hid it within the wound , closing it by magic. Once out of the Temple he re-opened the incision and took out the sacred letters .” In Revelation 19:16, John writes of the returning Christ: “ He hath on his THIGH a NAME written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords .” On a second tablet Enoch inscribed the secret knowledge of the angels. This tablet he gave to his son. The vaults were then sealed, and upon the spot Enoch supervised the construction of two magnificent, indestructable columns. One was made of fire-proof marble. The other of Laterus , or brick, so that it would not sink in water. In other words, it was a floating stone. In Druid myth, the floating stone was a blue glass blown in the shape of an egg or apple by the serpents of wisdom. Out"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 218 of this floating stone was born the phoenix or heron who utters the Word. In Egyptian myth, the heron landed at Heliopolis or On, aka Tula, atop the pillar or ben ben stone, and delivers an egg, ball or apple containing the wisdom concerning the Holy Blood. Wolram in his Parzival expressly states that the Grail is a stone from which the Phoenix rises. Therefore, the Grail is the floating stone. But what is the Grail? It is the Ark or vessel of Glass of Celtic myth, which is the ship of a god called Hu, who is the Atlantean Noah, because he escaped the great flood in his ship. His name is a variant of what the Jews called the Shekinah or ‘radiance’, the light which emerged from the sun. In Sanskrit Hu is ‘he-who-is-poured out’. Hu-Siris was one of the Greek names for Osiris. The idea of pouring out of the Holy Spirit or possibly the Holy Wisdom is echoed in the writings of the Hebrew prophets from Isaiah to Joel, whose prophecies said that at the last God will pour out his spirit, not upon the few initiates only, but upon all flesh. It appears the soul of the savior is contained in the ark/grail/apple and poured out. The Gnostics speak of a serpent soul that is poured out of a basket. This probably originated with the story of Ophiuchus or Asclepius. Is this serpentsoul the same as Chnoubis, the spirit of wisdom? What will pouring this soul of wisdom over all flesh accomplish? SIR WILLIAM ST. CLAIR’S LIBRARY Let us briefly review a few of the common connections King Solomon and the Cathars share concerning the Language"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 219 of the Birds. The Kore-An states that Solomon was given this language and that this was the source of his wisdom and prosperity. The Bible says Solomon learned this language directly from God. However, it is possible that Solomon learned from the Queen of Saba’s father. The Cathars spoke the Langue d’Oc, the Language of Yes, which I have related to the Language of the Birds and the Language of Ak-hen- aten. The Cathars maintained that the Gospel of Jesus should be understood in this language. I thought it important to review these connections since they make a striking appearance on the cover of the Rosslyn- Hay Manuscript , the most important book of the precious few to survive from William’s library. On the leather binding of the book one finds the monogram I.H.S., commonly interpreted as the monogram for Jesus. Interestingly, I.H.S means God of Yes to the inhabitants of Rosalyn... not in Scotland, but in Iraq. The binding of this manuscript also features numerous mysterious symbols which are repeated in Rosslyn Chapel. Does this strange confluence of symbols do more than suggest that we intepret the Rosslyn-Hay Manuscript in the Language of Yes? Another book found in William’s library is The Book of Troylus , which contains Grail romances and proves William knew of the legends of the Grail. Another is known as the Rosslyn Missal , which features a depiction of the shamir , the worm of wisdom whose touch split and shaped stone. King Solomon had to build his temple without the use of tools made of iron (because of Mosaic prohibition stated in Exodus. 20:25). Instead, the shamir was used to cut the stones."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 220 The Shamir from the Rosslyn Missal (above) and Chnoubis."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 221 THE COCKLE SHELL CONNECTION A moment ago I mentioned that William St Clair was believed to be a Knight of the Cockle and the Golden Fleece. This may provide a link with Rennes-le-Chateau since John is shown baptizing Jesus with a silvery cockle shell in the Church of Mary Magdalene. In his invaluable work Rosslyn -- A History of the Guilds, the Masons and the Rosy Cross , 15 Robert Brydon states that Father Richard Hay, the Rosslyn historian who recorded this fact, may have been confused. The ‘clambshell’ in France, where Hay was educated, is called the ‘ Coquille St. Jacques .’, and alludes to the ‘Knights of Santiago’, an order founded in Spain with strong Templar connections in the 12th century. After the massacre of 1307 many fugitive Templars joined this order. It is necessary to inject a few words from Flavia Anderson at this time about the Druid legend of the serpent's egg of the Phoenix or Heron. The serpent’s egg, says Anderson, was known to be a famous talisman of the Druids, ‘the faculty’ who once lived at Chartres but who came from Tula. The serpent’s egg was known as the Philosopher’s Stone. The alchemists called it ‘the Golden Apples of the Hesperides’ or the ‘golden bough’. The golden apple tree with its golden branches was adopted by Apollo -- who returned to Tula every 18.61 years-- as his sacred tree. In fact, his name, Apollo, comes from the Celtic abal , or apple. MELON is the Greek word for apple and sheep. Therefore, says Ms. Anderson, the Golden Apple is probably identical with the Golden Fleece. 16"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 222 Both appear to refer to the wisdom of Apollo or Tula. Pliny, she says, made the error of confusing the cockle shell with a sea-shell, which was said to have magical powers. He gives an astonishing description of how the serpent’s egg or the golden apple (the Sun God) was made. The snakes (souls) meet on a certain day of the moon. They twist themselves into many convultions and hiss, and their saliva form a bubble like a ring above the head of one of them, which the rest blow on till it comes off at the tail. Let’s imagine that the above is a description of the golden Palladium Pillar in use. The tip-off that it is the Pillar being described comes from Pliny, who says that even though set in gold (even though encased in the golden Pillar), the egg will float. As it comes from the tail of the serpent, the egg must be caught in mid-air into a cloak . 17 THE CLOAK A cloak you say? Our earlier brief introduction to the story of Cybele, Attis and the Palladium Pillar reveals additional insight into this aspect of the M-Istery we are seeking: that of the cloak or coat worn by Inanna, Jesus and the three wise men Nebuchadnezzar ordered into the fiery furnace. According to Higgins, when a person was admitted to the highest degrees, he received the Pallium or sacred cloak made of white lamb’s wool (the symbol of wisdom) to convey his authority. The white lamb’s wool is the Golden Fleece. It is probably the same as the PALA garment worn by Inanna at Mari. From these early days it was passed along from initiate to initiate. For example, when Elijah left his prophetic power to"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 223 Elisha, 18 he conferred it on him or installed him in his office, by the investiture of the Cloak, or the Pallium . Joshua, Joseph, and apparently Jesus are Biblical figures who possessed this Cloak. Higgins mentions that this Cloak appears to be the remnant of an ancient superstition, the original meaning of which has probably been forgotten. If only Higgins could have shared in the discovery of The Goddess With a Vase Statue . Then he would have known that the original meaning of the Cloak was not forgotten. It was part of the get-up worn by Inanna and the three wise men from Solomon's Temple in the story recorded in the Book of Daniel whenever the Pillar of God was ‘fired up’. Ms. Anderson states that the serpent’s egg was known in Wales as ‘the gem of the serpent’. This description reminds me of ‘the gem of the Gnostics’, which depicted Chnoubis, the serpent spirit of all knowledge which was born from the Pillar. The serpent's eggs or apples came to be identified with the glass rings that the Druids wore as amulets, probably slung around their necks. These amulets, she says, are usually green glass, but some are blue . 19 The Druids were the guardians of the glass egg. My heart thumped a little when I learned that these blue eggs were also known as the ‘moon goblet’ (which is the Holy Grail). 20 This fact tempted me to ask a question. Is the serpent’s egg or apple (the Son God) also known as blue apples? Is Jesus’ nickname in Heaven really Blue Apples? Are these the ‘blue stones’ Enki came to Earth to mine?"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 224 THE SERPENT’S TAIL Ms. Anderson reminds us that in the Celtic Grail legend the Mabinogi of Peredur , the hero Peredur arrives at a cave wherein dwells a serpent with a stone in its tail. 21 This ‘serpent soul ’ appears, once again, to be the Pillar. Peredur steals the stone from the serpent's tail. (Or, does he steal the blue apples from the Pillar?) The stone is quite valuable, for “whoever should hold it in one hand in the other will have as much gold as he may desire.” This obviously sounds like the shamir worm or serpent soul of the story of King Solomon. The pir, or bier (coffin), was another name for the nest of the Phoenix. When the egg or Blue Apple of the Phoenix ‘hatched’ a ‘worm’ was found in it. The ‘bird’ that was born from the worm was the golden serpent soul that Herodotus described as the Phoenix. The Egyptians of On or Heliopolis (Tula) also called it the heron. The heron appeared only once ever five hundred years. It came from ‘the Isle of Fire’, the Central Sun or Tula, the place of herons. When it arrived it brought its dead parent with it. To carry the parent, it first formed a ball or apple of myrrh (it blew through the Pillar, also known as the Myrrh Tree), and then, as the Druid myth corroborates, it hollowed out the ball and put the parent (a worm or serpent soul ) inside. Then it flew with the ball or apple to Heliopolis where it was born again from its own ashes. As Ms. Anderson implores, “It must be remembered that Wolfram in his Parzival expressly states that the Grail is a stone from which the Phoenix rises.” 22"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 225 The Phoenix as a Christian symbol for resurrection is portrayed in this beautiful floor moasic in a villa at Daphne near Antioch dating from the sixth century. The heron stands atop a mound or pyramid against a backdrop of rosebuds. According to a legend of Solomon’s Temple, Asmodius -- the green-robed demon guardian of the Church of Mary Magdalene at Rennes-le-Chateau -- gave Solomon the magical worm Shamir . This serpent soul’s (s)tone enabled Solomon to cut the stone of the temple without metal. Ms. Anderson points us to the obelisks at Heliopolis for examples of the handiwork of the Shamir. In order to make these Spears of Destiny, wooden plugs a half a yard apart were hammered into naked granite along a line. Then water was poured into the holes. In the sun’s rays the wood swelled."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 226 The stone then split in a line, a crack, which ran like a worm along twenty-five or more feet. However, as we have seen, the word ‘shamir’ appears to conceal a larger truth. If we drop the 's' we discover the word ‘hamir’, an anagram for hiram. Hiram was the name of the chief builder of Solomon’s Temple who reportedly gave Solomon the Shamir. King Solomon had received the plan for his temple directly from God. He hired Hiram, the King of Tyre and mastercraftsman, to direct the construction. MAY DAY Both the Books of Chronicles and Kings are loaded with the descriptions of the immense wealth and beauty of the golden palm trees and brass oxen, lions and cherubims and flowers and trees of Solomon’s Temple. Most eyecatching is the molten Sea of Brass outside its Holy of Holies. On the porch of the Temple we find her pair of two great pillars topped by lilly work. Named ‘Jachin’ and ‘Boaz’ these pillars stood on each side of the entrance porch to Solomon's Temple. These two pillars are the subjects of immense mystery. They are duplicated in the story of the Holy Grail. The first time Lancelot saw the Grail Queen Guenevere in the Grail Castle she is standing between two ‘copper’ pillars that were carved from malachite and topped with gilded capitals. 23 Copper always points the way, says folklorists, to an underworld entrance. As we have seen, the Hebrew word nahash means serpent, but it also means ‘copper’, and 'he who knows secrets'. In this way, Guenevere would be standing between two serpents, or entwined serpents."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 227 It is worth noting the tradition of the gypsies in Scotland. Every May and June the gypsies would assemble in the fields at Rossly castle. There they would perform their mystery plays. The Sinclair family would make available two towers for their use. These towers of Rosslyn take on remarkable signficance to our story when we learn they came to be known as ‘Robin Hood’ and ‘Little John’. Robin Hood is, of course, the Green Man. Little John, was Robin Hood’s chief ambassador. Therefore, we suggest he is playing the archetype of the Peacemaker, the forerunner of the Gardener. Every May the gypsies would re-enact their drama, centered on the activities of the two towers. This ceremony was officially banned by the Scottish Parliament on June 20, 1555 - the eve of John the Baptist's day - in a decree that stated that ‘no one should act as Robin Hood, Little John, Abbot of Unreason or Queen of May’. If the names of the players were changed to a Christian set we would say that ‘no one should act as the Gardener, the Peacemaker or Mary Magdalene’. THE APPRENTIC PILLAR On the floating Laterus stone Enoch inscribed the ‘seven sciences’ of humanity, the incredible ‘archives’ of the Masons. These may be equivalent to the seven rays of the heron, the Grail teachings designed to transform us into higher beings. It is worth noting that the word phoenix is supposed to have come from the Egyptian word Pa-Hanoch , which means ‘House of Enoch’. The ancients often called the Great Pyramid in Egypt the ‘Pillar of Enoch’."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 228 On the marble column Enoch placed a message that stated that nearby was buried an immense treasure in an underground vault. His work complete, Enoch then went to Mount Moriah in Jerusalem and was ‘translated to heaven’. 24 Egyptian myth says there were eight original keyholders to the Hall of Records underneath the Pyramid. 8 plus Enoch, makes nine. Enoch’s treasure was said to have remained secure until the time of King Solomon when the king discovered the vaults and the secret knowledge. Rosslyn is famed for its glorious Apprentice Pillar. The 8 serpents at the base of the Apprentice Pillar in Rosslyn chapel suggest William St Clair was in possession of secret knowledge for shaping matter given to humanity by the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The repetition of the serpent symbol and the shaping of matter suggest William intended Rosslyn to be viewed as a reproduction of Solomon’s Temple and the Garden of Eden. Is the Apprentice Pillar in Rosslyn Chapel the floating stone of myth? Even today it is said to contain the Holy Grail inside its twirling, sculptured stone. Does this mean the Golden Head of God, the forty-foot tall True Cross of Christ is there? The 8 serpent souls also call to mind the statement in 1 Peter 3:18-20: “For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, 8 souls were saved by water .”"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 229 8 souls saved by water? Was Rosslyn also intended to be a reproduction of Noah’s Ark too? THE INSTRUCTION MANUALS? Earlier, we noted that in 1244 AD the Pope launched a bloodthirsty campaign against the Cathars in an attempt to recover something , possibly even the instruction manual for the True Cross. Is it possible this instruction manual was among the Scrolls of the Nazarenes that were kept at the Temple of Solomon? What became of these Scrolls? Were they really left in the Temple, even after it had been picked clean throughout the ages? Did these Scrolls go to Rennes-le- Chateau? Authors Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas believe the Knights Templar took them to Rosslyn. 25 One convincing detail of their hypothesis came to light when they learned of a fire that occurred at Rosslyn in 1447, 26 one year after the three-foot thick foundation stone was laid. Upon learning that his building was on fire William St Clair was reported to have grown intensely worried, not for his wife and other ladies. All William cared about were his books! The books were concealed in four trunks that a priest risked life and limb to rescue. History asks us to believe these ‘books’ were civil documentation concerning his lands and titles. Knight and Lomas disagree. They conclude that William St Clair dedicated fifty years of his life to the construction of not just any building. He was constructing a duplicate of the Temple of Solomon, inluding underground vaults, as a Scroll shrine. 27 They are certain that they are among the four trunks that William was elated to learn were rescued from the fire"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 230 and are still at Rosslyn buried beneath three feet of rock. As they remark in The Hiram Key , 28 perhaps the most remarkable evidence to support their important view of Rosslyn is that it is still there at all. Enemies of the Templars, and all the secret fountain of knowledge that Rosslyn represents, have paraded past this structure for centuries. None have laid a hand on it. In fact, Rosslyn appears to have been left undisturbed for centuries. THE KEY PIECE? Knight and Lomas note that it is the Royal Arch ritual that tells of the Templar discovery of the scrolls in the ruins of Herod’s Temple. 29 The great detail of symbolism William St Clair had built into Rosslyn matched the descriptions provided in the Royal Arch Degree. They speculate that the Latin motto William St Clair had inscribed at Rosslyn came from the Nazarene scrolls: Wine is strong, A king is stronger, Women are even stronger, but TRUTH conquers all. Knight and Lomas quote key passages of the Royal Arch degree. 30 This document says the Key to unlocking the Royal Arch Degree is its definition of the Triple Tau, the badge of Royal Arch Masonry. It says the original definition of the Triple Tau signifies among other occult things: • Templum Hierosolyma -- the Temple of Jerusalem • Clavis ad Thesaurum -- A key to a treasure"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 231 • Theca ubi res pretiosa deponitur -- A place where a precious thing is concealed • Res ipsa pretiosa -- The precious thing itself. From this definition Knight and Lomas concluded that William St Clair constructed the pillars within Rosslyn as a symbolic way of saying Rosslyn represents the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem, and that this was the place where its treasure was concealed. 31 On the same page the authors noticed the meaning given for the Seal of Solomon (the Star of David) within the Royal Arch Degree. “The Companion’s Jewel of the Royal Arch is a double triangle, sometimes called the Seal of Solomon, within a circle of gold; at the bottom is a scroll bearing the words, Nil nisi clavis deest – ‘ Nothing is wanting but the key’ , and on the circle appears the legend, Si tatlia jungere possis sit tibi scire posse – ‘ If thou canst comprehend these things, thou knowest enough .’” 32 They conclude that these references sound as though they were created as clues for the individuals who would, one day, find the key and unlock the secrets of Rosslyn. They appear to be meant for them and only them. “If thou canst comprehend these things, thou knowest enough.” What ‘things’ are we talking about here? The trouble was, Mssrs. Knight and Lomas could not locate a Seal of Solomon anywhere in Rosslyn. Without the Seal, we do not learn the secret of the ‘things’ at Rosslyn. As Bob Lomas narrates, 33 we learn then, Chris drew a line through the bottom of the pillars of the Triple Tau, and taking out a pair of compasses, set them to the width of the building on the plan and described an arc out from each wall. The two"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"BLUE APPLES 232 arcs intersected exactly between the most westerly pillars to form an equilateral triangle. He then drew another line across the width of the building between the second two pillars from the west entrance and described two further arcs in the easterly direction; they intersected right in the center of the pillar of the Triple Tau, forming a perfect Seal of Solomon. At the very center of this invisible Seal of Solomon, they noticed, in the arched roof there is a large suspended boss in the form of a decorated arrowhead that points straight down to a keystone in the floor below. It is, they believe, this stone that must be raised to enter the reconstructed vaults of Herod's Temple and recover the scrolls. This arrowhead, they further conclude, was almost certainly added by William St Clair after the design of the building was complete, to provide a clue for some future generation to discover ‘ the key ’. 34 THE CLUSTER OF GRAPES Our investigation, however, enables a different perspective on this. Is it possible the ‘things’ William St Clair was pointing to with the arrowhead, and was urging us to comprehend, were not the scrolls underneath the Chapel? Instead, was he referring to the ‘things’ at the end of the arrowhead ? What do we find there? A cluster of grapes. Blue Apples!!! Why are they there? What do they represent? If we comprehend the Blue Apples, what then, do we know enough about? The symbolism cannot be clearer.

Rosslyn Chapel is William’s book in stone written in symbols from Egyptian, Celtic, Jewish, Templar and Masonic symoblism, the same way the Renne’s mystery was written by Abbe Boudet and Berenger Sauniere. In my forthcoming book The A-tomic Christ: The Search for the Secret Temple of the Christ Light , I investigate the removal of these secrets from Rosslyn to Oak Island, Nova Scotia. As a young man Franklin D. Roosevelt owned shares in a mining company that attempted to retrieve these secrets. Later, as President, he conducted a massive search for the secrets of the Grail.
