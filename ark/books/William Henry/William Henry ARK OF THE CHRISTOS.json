Whoever inspired the Sumerians to craft these seals appears also to have inspired the priestly poets, who, Sumerian scholar Zecharia Sitchin maintains, numbered the planets in our solar system from the outside in, as if they approached Earth from outside our solar system. 1 No names are given on the Sumerian cylinder-seals for the bodies depicted on them. This left it to the poets, or their muses, to fill in the blanks. Sitchin, who began publishing his poetic interpretations of these tales in 1976 in his Earth Chronicles series of five books, revolutionized the study of the Enuma Elisha , the ‘Babylonian Genesis’, and the Hebrew Genesis by bringing forth a creation tale whose implications literally could transform the human race. His controversial work constitutes a potential major breakthrough in our understanding of fundamental questions that have always perplexed humankind: Who are we? How did we get here? What are we doing here? How do we return home? In these olden texts we learn the extra planet located between Mars and Jupiter is called TIAMAT, a goddess who has two faces. In the patriarchal tradition she is called “the monster,” and the “serpent dragon of chaos.” While in the older matriarchal tradition she is called the “maiden of life,” and is described in glowing terms as a scintillating prize to behold: the primordial sea-goddess that would face an incredible Atlantis-like fate. The Enuma Elisha tells how Armageddon struck this Goddess. She was violently split into pieces. One half of Tiamat was demolished and became the asteroid b elt, “the hammered bracelet” or planetary debris field circling Mars and Jupiter. The other half became Earth. In other words, as Sitchin says, Earth is Tiamat reincarnated.

When the labor became too intense for these ancient astronauts, E.A. genetically altered the proto-humans then inhabiting the planet, creating humanity as a slave race. The interchange of the biblical term El and the Sumerian Shining Ones illuminates much of previously muddled myth and scripture, particularly the four quintessential quotations from the book of Genesis: 1:1 In the beginning, the Shining Ones created the heavens and the Earth. 1:26 The Shining Ones said, ‘Let us make man in our image, in the likeness of ourselves. 2:8 Yahweh (the leader of the Shining Ones ) planted a Garden in the east...

ARK OF THE CHRISTOS 9 Economically speaking a self-generating clone, such as the first humans, is a cheaper and more efficient solution than mechanical robots. However, this cost is offset by the risk involved in creating a creature with powers equal to or even surpassing their own, which Sitchin asserts, was one of Enlil’s objections to his half-brother’s genetic tinkering. The key to this story, as far as this investigation is concerned, is E.A.’s ability as an alchemist.

One of the most impressive examples of an apparently genuine transmutation of base metals into gold is also among the most fully documented -- that of Nicholas Flamel of Paris. 38 Flamel was born about 1330. In his own words, he describes quite candidly how not only was he drawn to alchemy, but how, after ‘only’ twenty-four years of searching, encouraged by his wife, Perronelle, he finally discovered the secret of making gold. Flamel was a manuscript copier and book trader. One night, he had a dream in which an angel appeared to him and showed him a large, copper-bound book with pages of thin bark, and engraved with strange hieroglyphic characters . The angel told him that one day he would discern the pages of the book. When he reached out to touch it, the book vanished into an aura of light along with the angelic figure. For ye ars, Flamel was haunted by the dream until one day the book appeared in his bookshop. It was the commencement of Flamel’s life work and the beginning of his attainment of the Philosopher’s Stone. Another key figure in alchemical history that encountered the “copper book” is Dr. Carl G. Jung, who proposed the idea of the “collective unconscious,” the global brain, or what I refer to as the Thought Sphere. In my book The A~tomic Christ: F.D.R.’s Search for the Secret Temple of the Christ Light , 39 I explored Jung’s interest in the alchemical dreams of Wolfgang Pauli, a patient of Jung, and a physicist who laid considerable groundwork in atomic th eory. In this book I noted that many of the key symbols of the Manhattan Project are identical with symbolism that is found in ancient mystery religions, mythology, folklore, fairytales – and especially Holy Grail symbolism, and alchemy. Dr. Jung personally experienced this symbolism and the “copper book” in his dreams. In his autobiographical Memories, Dreams, Reflections , he wrote: ARK OF THE CHRISTOS 22 bound’ book.

In a later chapter we will investigate several prophecies, including those of the Mayans’, which indicate a wormhole will open again in 2012. The Shining Ones from Planet X, I have proposed, are the technicians in charge of this transportation system. The primary question in our age, as in times past, will be who is in charge of this gateway? Will the descendents of E.A., who sought to uplift and educate humanity, even to the level of the gods, be in charge? Or will the legions of Enlil, the militaristic commander who seeks to sexually subjugate and physically and spiritually enslave humanity be running the affairs of Earth? Myth and history, examples of which we will explore, are filled with clues and stories of human beings who have encountered the Shining Ones or their teaching and transformed themselves preparatory to the wormhole"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ARK OF THE CHRISTOS 46 experience.

After his baptism in this knowledge Jesus mounted his white horse and was on his way from average man to Christos. Set to unleash the secrets of the ages, and possibly create a planet full of spiritually actualized Christ- like beings, Jesus was executed as a revolutionary by the Roman world order.

So Tula or Tua can be also read Kua . This makes sense. Think of the word a-kua or aqua , meaning ‘water’. Tula, we know, is the source of the Living Waters of compassion. Kuan Yin , the Buddhist goddess of compassion, answers to this word play. Tua and Kua can also be tur and kur (meaning ‘stone’). Phonetically, kur is cure and core . We have already encountered this term in e-kur , the Sumerian name for the ‘land of no return’. Once it is reached the soul apparently does not need to return to Earth. The Sanskrit kr , or core, has the meaning “to make,” and is the likely root of Creator , i.e our maker . 20 This further explains why the Sumerians called the home of the soul accessed by the (worm) hole in the ground the e-kur . It is the Galactic Core. Additional kr or cr words of interest are car , meaning heart, and crib , synonymous with manger . The association of the core with a manger breathes new life into the myth of Jesus’ lowly birth in a manger. Instead of a birth in a barn this location could well point to a cosmic birthplace. Indeed, the core is considered a cosmic nursery or manger, and the waters of the Central Sun, the Heart of the Galaxy, are believed to have healing or curative qualities; hence my reference to the core as the Healing Sun of the Healing Son.

The question of the whirlwind was never put to Bush by the national media. This left it open to interpretation. Some Christians on Internet discussion groups were nervous about the statement.

Nahum 1-4 clearly states this: “ The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies. The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will not leave the gu ilty unpunished.

Nor does it explain why Gorbachev repeated Reagan’s ‘joke’ in a major address at the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow in February 1987. After ruminating about the destiny of the world and the future of humanity he recalled his meeting with Reagan in Geneva. “At our meeting in Geneva, the U.S. President said that if the Earth faced an invasion by extraterrestrials , the United States and the Soviet Union would join fo rces to repel such an invasion. I shall not dispute this hypothesis, though I think it’s early yet to worry about such an intrusion.” 7 The Reagan-Gorbachev “let’s cooperate in space” exchange is hauntingly similar to the vision of the abrupt end of the Cold War proposed by president John F. Kennedy. Speaking before the commencement exercises at the American University in June 1963, Kennedy said: “In short, both the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race.

It is the Hebrew word for ‘terror’. Beyond the Emah was Babylon’s most important temple, the Esagila, the dwelling-place of the sun god Mard uk, the Babylonian name for Pl anet X.

These “streams” appear to be a spiritual weapon as they held the result of carrying the gods away, nullifying their protection. Next, we learn X “diluted Tiamat’s vitals” and “pinched her eyes.” These “vitals,” notes Sitchin, could refer to her atmosphere or life support system. Her eyes could describe the destruction of her orbiting satellites, telescopes or “eyes.” Blind, Tiamat “paced about distraught.” The next event is stomach wrenching. As X approached Tiamat, pieces of her flesh were blown away, e ither from gravitational forces or some powerful weaponry. In this fantastic conflict X’s primary weapon against Tiamat was a four-cornered Net: The four winds he (X) stationed that nothing of her could escape : The South Wind, the North Wind. the East Wind, the West Wind.

In effect, it would look l ike a black, rectangular box, floating in space: a black cube or black prism. This rectangular spool approximates in three dimensions the rectangular wormhole that Visser imagines exists in four dimensions. 28 In this model the top of the spool is one part of space and bottom is another. The surfaces of the cube are flat (in accord with Einstein’s general theory of relativity).

Ordinary matter, like this book, has p ositive energy. Nothing weighs less than nothing. Right? In fact this may not be the case. In a lab in Seattle, Steve Lamoreaux, professor at the University of Washington, has shown that negative energy can be made. In a BBC Horizon documentary he did it using junk materials in his lab. According to Visser, who is a theoretical expert on negative energy, the experiments are a proof in principle that at least small amounts of exotic matter, effectively negative energy, do exist in the real world. In the future an sufficiently advanced wormhole technician might be able to make enough of it to stretch a wormhole big enough and hold it open long enough to make a safe journey across the galaxy. When Visser looked at Thorne and Morris’ list of essentials for wormhole construction he found only one that seemed debatable: the requirement of spherical symmetry. In the Thorne and Morris model the wormhole would be constructed as something resembling a flattened hourglass.

In the Sumerian story, when E.A. came along to clean up the mess Planet X had created he made the first human on Earth out of Kingu’s blood or “living waters”. 1 Kingu was identified with our Moon. The Chaldeans called him Sin. The interchange of the Moon and Sin casts new light on the belief that we were made in sin. An astonishing term applied to Jesus is “the healing moon man.” 2 Poet and mythologist Robert Graves says this was the meaning of the name Christos , fittingly applied to Jesus, the son of Mary, the almah or “moon- maiden,” who was also known as the Ark. Upper Egypt was originally called Khemennu , “Land of the Moon.” 3 Khemennu is the r oot for ‘al-chemy’. No overt explanation is given for the origin of this name. Yet, in this term lies the key to the mystery of the Ark of the Christos. In the Temple of Horus at E dfu in Egypt, a temple dedicated to bringing the Sun god Horus to Earth, we find depictions of a ladder extending from a pillar that translates the king to a crescent-shaped boat."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"ARK OF THE CHRISTOS 195 A ladder reaches into a crescent-shaped boat or ark.

If our Moon is this Ark, and the Ark is the Great Yoni or “bearer of the seeds of life,” this suggests that the Moon is a space ship as is seemingly portrayed in the Egyptian depiction. The origin and nature of the Moon is one of the most complicated problems of cosmogony. So far there have been three theories to explain how the Moon came to be our planet’s partner. The first states that our Moon was once a part of the Earth and broke away from it. This theory is used to explain the enormous pit in the Pacific Ocean. The evidence has now refuted this. The second is t hat the Moon was formed independently from the same cloud of dust and gas as the Earth, and immediately became the Earth’s natural satellite. This theory was a favorite of scientists until analysis of samples brought back by the U.S. Apollo astronauts showed that lunar rock is not of the same composition as the Earth’s. This leaves the third theory. The Moon came into being separately, and, moreover, far from the Earth (perhaps even outside the solar system). This would mean that the Moon would not have to be fashioned from the same “clay” as our own planet.

These priests are thought to have evolved from a class of Egyptian priestesses called shemat , or singing-mothers, who knew the hymns and words of power. 3 Another vehicle that shares m uch of the intriguing mythology of the shem is the Mer-Ka-Ba , the mystical Hebrew ‘chariot of the spirit’ that carried Ezekiel into the heavens. It may also be the same as the vehicle of resurrection and ascension Jesus rode into the heavens. In my view, it is the protective vehicle -- the white horse -- in which the Christos rides the wormhole. The most ancient teaching of the Kabballah was the Merkaba meditation. The Talmud mentions the Merkaba meditation when it says that Judah the Prince forbade any mention of it in the Mishnah, presumably because it was a mystical teaching. However, references to it in the Tosefta, which is a kind of appendix to the Mishnah, as well as some surviving manuscripts, point to the Merkaba meditation being practiced at least as far back as the second century BC. It appears that Merkaba practitioners combined meditation, prayer, and yogic postures in such a way that they ascended, or descended, in their Merkabas, in their “vehicles”, to realms where they literally saw the Seraphim, the crystal halls of Christ’s Court, and the crystal throne of glory (the Apsu?), or Tula itself."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"ARK OF THE CHRISTOS 209 One of the most prominent gods who sits upon a whirling, wheeling Merkaba throne is the Hebrew Yahweh.

As a priest educated at An (On or Hel iopolis), Moses was initi ated into the Egyptian and proto-Egyptian mysteries, probably including the mysteries of the Shemsu-Hor, the ‘priestesses of the Shem’ whom we will further investigate momentarily. At the time of the Exodus the whole Sinai Peninsula was the “Land of Sinim,” i.e., “Land of the Moon.” After one meeting with Yahweh Moses returned with a blueprint for constructing the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark became a portable substitute for Mount Sinai - enabling the Israelites to continue communications with God even when far removed from their sacred mountain. In this respect it should be noted that God appeared above the Ark in exactly the same way as he appeared upon Mount Sinai, i.e. in fire and a cloud of vapor and, furthermore, in the form of his ‘Glory’. In other words, he appeared exactly as the Aryan god Ahura had appeared when seen in his glowing ark on top of Mount Hara , as a being of light. Is the Hebrew Yahweh who spoke to Moses out of the fire on Mount Horeb to be considered as a copy of Ahura who spoke from Mount Hara ? Or, are they the same being? Was this Enlil? Or E.A.?

Stories of this pillar and its connection to holes in space and souls can be traced to the Egyptian Coffin Texts that tell that after the flood the Shem su - Hor erected the djed pillars, which we re power devices for balancing natural forces in the Earth and the atmosphere. In his excellently researched Giza One , Joseph Jochmans explains how planting these sacred power objects raised the Egg or Is-Land of creation. One was called the “Member of Progenitor,” another the “Image of the Arm,” apparently in relation to the ability of this device to uplift or separate the Earth from the waters of the Nile. Once the Egg of Creation was habitable, say the Edfu texts, djed pillars , used to channel and balances the soul sphere were set up on the Egg. These djed pillars were the Pillars of Love.

THE SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN My basic research premise is that the Pillar of Osiris and the Ark or Cross of the Christos are the same device, and that this technology is modeled in our mystic anatomy designed by E.A. and Ninharsag. Fur ther, this device is at the center of biblical prophecy, and consequently, the center of the prophecy of the return of Planet X. In support of this premise I two examples from Judeo-Christian artwork that show the Ark of the Covenant with its Pillar attachment, and the combined Pillar as the True Cross of Christ. Featured on the next page is an illumination from the famed eleventh century Winchester Bible now housed at the Oxford Library. It shows David triumphantly dancing before the Ark of the Covenant as it is being carried into Jerusalem with great pomp and ceremony. On the right side of the illumination is a stylized Pillar of Osiris. On the left is a ‘worm’ or ‘serpent-soul’ that lives in the Ark. The worm and pillar are a perfect match for hieroglyph of the Casket or Pillar of Osiris that is topped by the Shuti or enlightenment tablet symbol. They both symbolize the naggar or ‘serpent soul of wisdom’. As we can see, someone ‘in the know’ within the Catholic Church in the eleventh century must have secretly known of the existence of this device and the serpent soul which lives within it.

In support of this premise I two examples from Judeo-Christian artwork that show the Ark of the Covenant with its Pillar attachment, and the combined Pillar as the True Cross of Christ. Featured on the next page is an illumination from the famed eleventh century Winchester Bible now housed at the Oxford Library. It shows David triumphantly dancing before the Ark of the Covenant as it is being carried into Jerusalem with great pomp and ceremony. On the right side of the illumination is a stylized Pillar of Osiris. On the left is a ‘worm’ or ‘serpent-soul’ that lives in the Ark. The worm and pillar are a perfect match for hieroglyph of the Casket or Pillar of Osiris that is topped by the Shuti or enlightenment tablet symbol. They both symbolize the naggar or ‘serpent soul of wisdom’. As we can see, someone ‘in the know’ within the Catholic Church in the eleventh century must have secretly known of the existence of this device and the serpent soul which lives within it. They have sought to preserve knowledge of its existence. ARK OF THE CHRISTOS 277 12.

As the rainbow has seven colors, so too does makara have five ministers, with the fifth having two sacred names, for a total of seven. Poetically speaking, makara is “Mother Ark,” which leaves little to wonder why, in the Old Testament Makara the crocodile appears in the guise of Leviathon , and is interpreted as the cosmic serpent Tiamat . Associated with the Makara and the trefoil from the very beginning is the symbol of a “bunch of grapes,” which was found on the Makaras.
