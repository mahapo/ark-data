THE LAND OF OSIRIS It’s 10:00 am local time Monday May 12, 2004 and after a ‘short’ nine-hour flight from Gotham City, our Egypt Air 777 is descending out of the skies above Egypt. At 5000 feet or so I peer out the window of the jet at what seems like a never-ending desert. It’s incredibly hazy. A moment later the roofs of sand covered dwellings come into view. The structures and the desert landscape look ‘bombed out’, more like I would expect Iraq to look, courtesy of the red, white and blue, than Egypt. As I stare in amazement, little do I realize it but the ‘grinding of the pearl’ had commenced. Egypt is already working its magic on me. It is my first trip to ‘the wilderness’, Egypt. I am traveling as a guest lecturer with the Stargate Mystery School’s “Ancient Sciences and Modern Technologies Revealed” tour. I am deeply appreciative of the opportunity this group offered me to investigate first hand the mysteries of this ancient land. Exiting the airport and headed for our tour bus, we walk into a 100 plus degree oven of hot smog many times worse than I had ever experienced in America’s smoggiest cities on their smoggiest day. Summer’s here in Egypt and the time is right for gasping in the heat. Our host, Gouda Fayed, explained that we arrived at the tail end of a three"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 2 day sand storm. It will soon pass, he assured us. Phew! Praise God! Along the drive from the airport into Cairo (originally “El-Kahira,” from the Arabic “El-Kahir” – which means ‘Mars’), the signs of homogenized western civilization I see everywhere I go -- billboards, office buildings, strip malls with a Radio Shack store -- gradually recede. Twenty-first century urban Egypt’s ‘total assault on the senses’, as Jordan Maxwell called it, takes over. Then you’re there, facing a soul-wrenching swirl of unexpected and overwhelming filth and poverty. Brown and sand are the dominant colors. Everywhere one looks the minarets of Cairo’s thousand or so ornate, and obviously expensive, mosques jut into the smoggy sky. Cairo’s landscape is largely composed of unfinished six to eight story mud brick housing projects with rusty ray bar sticking out their tops. Incredibly, many of these multi- dwelling structures are windowless. The yards around them are strewn with trash and piled up gravel. Packs of homeless dogs snoop through the trash for food. Modern housing complexes have windows, along with satellite dishes and laundry hanging from balconies. The cars, 1960s era buckets of bolts on wheels belch black smoke into the air. The drivers use their horns often. And they need them! Egyptian drivers are daredevils. They practically play chicken with one another. In this city of 17 million souls one is amazed to observe that there are virtually no traffic lights! Pedestrians cross the street strictly at their own risk, deftly dodging speeding cars. At first glance, Cairo, I think, opens a window to a horrifying glimpse into our possible future. It is a sprawling"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 3 post-apocalyptic cacophony of overpopulation mixed with a thick cocktail of pollution. This milieu, I think, could easily be the Los Angeles of 2020. At the time I had no idea how exciting this place could be. Our destination was Gouda’s Tree of Life Bazaar, a conference center across the street and a stone’s throw away from the Sphinx. After ten tough miles of gear-grinding ‘driving’ in heavy traffic southwest of the Cairo airport, and battling my self-doubts about this trip, I caught my first glimpse of the three great lights of Giza; Menkare, Chephren and Cheops. Through the haze of the sandstorm these sentinels of time appeared as darkened, but triumphant, silhouettes against the sky. There’s only one way to describe the pyramids: wow. It is indeed pulse quickening, and for some reason just a bit scary, to see these artifacts for the first time. Though bordered by Cairo they seem out of place... set apart ‘ooparts’. This first glimpse reminded me of seeing Dealy Plaza and the Grassy Knoll in Dallas or Chartres Cathedral from a distance for the first time. Ominously moored alone like a great ship in the wheat fields near Paris, Chartres is isolated -- like a cooling tower of a nuclear power plant. It felt like I was on sacred ground. Turning onto the palm tree-lined Pyramid Street leading to the ‘Fink-us’ and ‘Pyramid-us’ (as the locals pronounce"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 4 these words) felt like entering a kind of time tunnel. The trash – newspapers, plastic soda bottles, etc. -- free-floating in the dark brown water of canal beside the street signaled more despair was to come. I wondered why no one bothered to clean it up. I grew up in Detroit, Michigan where it was not unusual to see trash-littered streets and lifeless slums. But I’ve never seen anything like this. At first, I interpreted the shocking filth of Cairo as a sign of an unfortunate people. I was wrong. The people of Egypt are the friendliest and warmest I have ever met. Many of them have nothing by American standards. All that many own they wear on their back. Still, in the eyes of many Egyptians one can see that they have been fortunate to find the ‘something’ that many Americans seek and that money cannot buy, the simple joy of living. In contrast to the American way, which I consider to be rooted in suspicion of foreigners, the Egyptian way is rooted in friendliness toward the pilgrims who come to these desert shores from distant lands. Tennessee, where I live, is famous for its ‘southern hospitality’. From what I experienced in Egypt, however, Tennesseans could take a lesson about hospitality from the Egyptians. Honesty too. I left $300 in my pants pocket that I sent to the laundry aboard our Nile cruise ship. This large sum of money, by Egyptian standards, was returned to me with a note telling me it was found. I kept the note as a souvenir. My family was alarmed about me traveling to Egypt during the War on Terror (read ‘Islam’). The release of the horrific pictures of the disgusting sexual torture of Iraqi prisoners at the hands of sadistic terrorists clothed as US military police just before my departure didn’t make things"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 5 any easier. The Arab world was inflamed over the disgraceful perversion of the collective American psyche these photos revealed. So was I. As it turned out, my family had nothing to worry about. As in France, which I visited in May 2003 at the height of the American anti-French campaign (over their refusal to back the Bush Administration’s Iraq play), the native Egyptians welcomed us with open arms. This proved to me, once again, that average citizens are not the source of the modern conflicts between cultures. The source is the creepy politicians with secret agendas and their masters, the slimy corporate manipulators profiteering from the propaganda of our helter skelter descent into terror. Upon arrival at Gouda’s we huffed and puffed up four flights of stairs to a large conference room overlooking the Giza Plateau. (I came to call Egypt the ‘land of stairs’ because one is constantly ascending steps.) Still a bit shell-shocked from the ride from the airport, I was hoping to catch a shower and relax a bit. But first I had to see the pyramids and the Sphinx close-up. Opening the curtains we looked out the window to see the three stars of Egypt and the great young man-cat the ancients called the King of Terror. The Sphinx appeared smaller than I expected, but larger than life nonetheless. There must have been a thousand or more people milling about the artifacts. A tour group huddled together for a photo in front of the Sphinx look like a school of fish. Just when I was thinking to myself that this has to be the greatest show on Earth and Gouda must have one of the most incredible views available in the solar system, he invited us to see the view from his roof."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 6 We hiked our jet-lagged bones up another flight of stairs to the roof top patio. And, then, there they were. In addition to ‘wow’, the (s)word “magnificent”, though dull with use, can be applied to the monuments of Giza. Taking a gulp of the arid pyramid dust laden air to wash down my astonishment from this panoramic view, I felt like I was ten million miles away from the green, green hills of Tennessee. I also felt like time had stopped. Sitting on the border of myth and reality, their secrets shrouded in annals of history – or, more likely, buried in the inhospitable sands surrounding it -- the three pyramids looked to me like a pillar or beacon that belonged to a long- gone race from a remote age. The pyramids are enormous. Stripped of their limenstone cover stones they sit naked, exposed on an elevated plateau the ancient Egyptians called ‘the Egg of Creation’. Though appearing to be a short distance away from Gouda’s, the steep paved but sand-covered pathway gently winding up to the Great Pyramid is actually more than a mile long. People walking beside the pyramids look like ants in front of a pile of sugar. Since the dawn of recorded history, humans have revered the famed peaks of Giza. Now under the dominion of the Crescent of Allah, they stand as mountains of mystery, crowded on one side by modern Cairo and protected on the other by desert. They do indeed have a mystical and mind-expanding effect. “Pyramids,” I say to myself over and over. “Tell me your secrets.”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 7 The Giza Plateau seen from a low earth orbiting satellite. The dividing line between modern Cairo and the desert is clear.

They remind me that if I am to succeed in discovering anything about Egypt I must blend my will (symbolized by the dog) with the patience of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 8 the donkey, the ‘steed of the immortals’. Cats have baraka , ‘the blessing’, the ‘breath of life’, the name for a local brand of bottled water. I call blessing ‘synchronicity’ and define it as being in the right place at the right time with the right people, the right attitude, the right words and the right action. I hope this Force is with me on this trip. “Pyramids. Tell me your secrets.” At first, I thought it was at sunset that the Great Pyramid was in her crowning glory. But then the night sky blanketed the plateau. I realized that it is at night that her secrets are revealed. Here, at what some claim is the center of Earth’s land masses, I experienced an unexpected and peculiar visual effect. The horizon drops off sharp behind the pyramids. It looks like you’re on the edge of the flat earth. As I gazed into the night sky, the stars and planets appeared, to me, not to be ‘up’ there as at home. They are ‘out’ there, and appear to be orbiting on a direct line ‘out’. It was quite an amazing experience. Standing alone at the edge of this great divide I felt a part of the revolving planets for the first time. Venus was so ‘close’ ‘over’ there that I felt as though I could step ‘off’ the Giza Plateau ‘onto’ the Planet of Love. What a trip! This experience reminded me of the effect seeing a documentary about the Swiss farmer Billy Meier’s alleged (probably fake) encounters with silver disk-shaped objects and a female being from the Pleiades had on me back in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 9 1990. Driving home afterwards I remember looking into the night sky with a new sense of wonderment. For the first time I saw that the stars in our sky are not merely two- dimensional points of light pushed into the black background of the darkness of space. Instead, I saw the stars as three-dimensional suns (in fact there are hundreds of billions of such suns in our Milky Way). I appreciated the fact that vast horizons and enormous distances of three- dimensional space are beyond or behind the stars and planets. I literally felt my mind expand in that moment. Now, fourteen years after my ‘Pleiadean Attunement’, I found myself standing before the three pyramids of Giza, which, it has been observed, are patterned after the three belt stars of the constellation Orion, experiencing another consciousness raising effect. According to Greek mythology, Merope , one of the Seven Sisters forming the Pleiades spurned the love of Orion. Both experiences hammered home awareness of the enormity of the cosmic being we are all a part of. Fascinatingly, t he middle \"star\" of Orion is actually not a star at all, but the Great Orion Nebula , a turbulent star nursery set within a maelstrom of luminescent gas. To the naked eye, it looks like a star, however, with binoculars or a telescope, you can see that it is actually a huge cloud of glowing gas. It’s only about 1,600 light years away. The beautiful colors of Orion come from the baby stars being born. The famed “horse head” nebula is found in Orion. Orion figures prominently in the star myth of Osiris, the Egyptian savior and god of resurrection. Egyptian myth says that after Osiris’s death, his BA or soul went to the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 10 star Alnitak in the Orion constellation where it would traverse the sky forever, as the god of Orion. Interestingly, some believe Lord Osiris was an actual man. Beginning in the late 1990s rumors began to circulate that some villagers from the Giza area had seen the sleeping body of Osiris, clothed in a pink robe, inside the Great Pyramid! On March 2, 1999, FOX television broadcast the infamous live program entitled “Opening the Lost Tombs: Live From Egypt.” The last segment of the ‘live’ broadcast featured the ‘Tomb of Osiris.’ Led by Dr. Zahi Hawass, the Egyptian Director of the Giza Plateau, FOX investigated a shaft located not far from the Sphinx under the causeway of Khafre long known to archaeologists. At about 25m underground, he excavated a room completely filled with water. After the excavation, he looked down into the water and saw the remains of four pillars surrounded by a wall. Inside them was part of a large, granite sarcophagus with the lid thrown off. This discovery appeared to confirm the words of Herodotus when he said that Cheops was buried inside a granite sarcophagus and there was water near Cheop’s pyramid. People have always wondered about these words, notes Hawass, but no one ever discovered the exact location. Even Herodotus admitted that he never saw the burial with his own eyes, because he would never be able to go down into the shaft. Hawass made a second “discovery” from this excavation after moving the lid of the sarcophagus. He found inscribed in the ground the hieroglyphic word \" pr \", meaning \"house.\" It is known that the Giza plateau was"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 11 called \" pr wsir nb rstaw \", or \"the house of Osiris, Lord of Rastaw.\" \"Rastaw\" (also spelled Ros-Tau ) refers to the underground tunnels, and most likely the name of the plateau reflects the tunnels inside the Osiris Shaft. The final chamber Hawass found was most likely a symbolic tomb for the god Osiris; he was believed to control the underground tunnels and tombs of the kings. The author with the Sphinx and Pyramid.

This passage is related to the deepest mysteries, “the passage of the soul into realms of immortality.” In my lectures I frequently point out the curious fact that Ros-Tau is an anagram for Stau-Ros , the Greek word meaning ‘pillar’ that was originally used in early bibles to denote the pillar or cross of crucifixion of Jesus. In my opinion, this word play connects the myths, mysteries and metaphysics of the resurrection of Jesus with the resurrection science of Osiris. If Osiris were an actual person, rather than the mythic character upon whose back a collection of myths and scientific principles has been heaped as scholars maintain, this would be phenomenal. If his body were found it would be earth shaking. Comparable in magnitude to finding the tomb and actual body of Jesus Christ!"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 13 2. IN SEARH OF THE PURE At sunrise on my first morning in Egypt I sat on Gouda’s roof drinking in the extraordinary view of the Sphinx and pyramids. I meditated on why I had come to Egypt. A tara -ist at large in search of the secrets of enlightenment ( tara ), I came to Egypt, the land of Khem (‘alchemy’), as the ancients called it, to investigate the One Great Secret: the secret of transforming a human into a pure one. This is the Great Work of alchemy, symbolized in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyph peri (‘rise’) as the feet walking into the vibrating string or open mouth of the Milky Way , the ‘Field of the Blessed’. This ‘field’, I believe, is a domain and a field of energy. After nearly two decades of research, I had surmised that the Peri or Pure – who I believe later were called Cathars (‘the Pure’) in France -- had access to this blessed domain via a Pillar of Light. This Pillar is a “resurrection machine” and is called, among many names, Osiris, and ‘the vine plant of ‘ aaru ’, or the blessed’. The components of this Pillar are featured in the hieroglyph of Osiris (next page), the Egyptian savior and god of resurrection. Its pedestal resembles in form, and I believe function, the biblical Ark of the Covenant. Flanking the ‘ark’ are two TET or ‘power’ pillars."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 14 The hieroglyph of Osiris . In the Dictionary of Ancient Egypt the TET pillar is stated to have been: A powerful weapon of magic for all deceased Egyptians, considered necessary to aid in the transformation of the human flesh into the spiritual form assumed by the dead in eternity . Here is an important reference to flesh and a spiritual transformation. The side posts of Egyptian temple’s entrance doors are often ornamented with horizontal bands of bas-reliefs portraying the TET in the company of two other symbols: Uas , the tree branch, commonly called the ‘Key of the Nile’, and Ankh -- ‘the Key of Life’. These symbols are placed on a netted basket. This basket is ‘ the All’ . Interestingly, the basket symbol also means ‘Lord’."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 15 The ankh, tet and uas with the basket or ‘the All’. Early Christian texts describe Mary Magdalene as ‘the woman who knew the All’. Though this may sound strange, it is possible this is a reference to the Egyptian All. Perhaps this is not so strange after all once we realize Jesus was sometimes called Jesus Ben Panther, or Jesus son of Pan- ther. This name is believed by msytics to be a play on the Greek words pan and theos , meaning ‘All the gods’."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 16 The Osiris Symbol. ‘This King is Osiris, this pyramid of the King is Osiris , this construction of his is Osiris...’Pyramid Texts, Utterance 600."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 17 Isis stands behind Osiris who is portrayed as a many-eyed man.

The Osirion is one of Egyptian archaeology’s greatest challenges. No one knows who built it or why. Interestingly, the design of the Osirion, notes Egyptologist John Anthony West in The Traveler’s Key to Ancient Egypt , is strikingly similar to the Valley Temple of Chephren, a small temple made of colossal stones, some weighing over 100 tons, that sits beside the Sphinx. The so- called Cheprhen temple is the only other example of monolithic (colossal) granite architecture."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 20 The red granite blocks of the Chephren temple. It is thought that the Valley Temple was used by the neter , the divine ones, for purification rites. More and more these rites have come to dominate my research. These rites enabled one to access the Aaru , the place of entrance and exit from the invisible world, the never-never land of the neter-neter . Interestingly, the Egyptian glyph for ru , , is a symbol for ‘the gate’ (more later).

My research reveals this the Milky Way galaxy. According to Massey’s poetic interpretation, Aaru was also the mountain of Amenta called Shennu or Shenni = Hebrew Sinai. This was the place of passing over, through or the place of crossing (the Sumerian ‘nibiru’) in the Exodus or coming forth from the land of bondage when commemorated as an historical Pass-over or Pass-Through. The Aaru Field of the Blessed’s tree of life was called the sycamore, fig, or the Pillar of Osiris.

In addition to being an incredibly powerful ‘light house’ capable of beaming enormous amounts of energy, similar to Nikola Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower, this mysterious force/device, I have postulated, opened the mouth of what modern science calls a stargate or wormhole, a universal transportation system linking two points in space that is a natural after effect of the Big Bang. Our galaxy, the entire universe in fact, is permeated by interconnected tunnels of light, says this theory. This Pillar, I have theorized, opens these holes in space, fulfilling the role of modern day particle accelerator. My work centers upon seeking the secrets of this Pillar/Resurrection Machine. Several hypotheses have emerged from my research. 1. This pillar is the mast of the serpent ship of the gods. 2. I believe the human body is a form of this device. 3. Once activated, the human body has capability of transforming into a being of light preparatory to entering the gate of the gods. This is the Great Work of humanity."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 24 The Pillar of Osiris overlaid upon a meditating woman. One of the ‘legs’ upon which my theory rests is a story brought forward by the Greeks regarding Osiris’s demise. The story tells us that one of Osiris's two brothers, Set, along with seventy-two conspirators, plotted against him. Measuring the body of Osiris without his knowledge, Set fashioned and highly decorated a coffer of the same size, and once when they were all drinking and making merry he"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 25 brought in the coffer and jestingly promised to give it to the one whom it should fit exactly. The last one to try, Osiris stepped into it and lay down. On that the conspirators ran and slammed the lid down on him, nailed it fast, soldered it with molten lead, and flung the coffer into the Nile. Isis, sister and wife of Osiris, seeking the body, was given advice from the god of wisdom and took refuge in the papyrus swamps of the Delta. Afterwards Isis herself gave birth to a son in the swamps. This is north of the Great Pyramid today. She had conceived him while she fluttered in the form of a hawk over the corpse of her dead husband. The infant was the younger Horus, as Osiris' first brother was named Horus as well. The young Horus in his youth bore the name of Harpocrates, that is, the child Horus. Meanwhile the coffer containing the body of Osiris floated down the river and away out to sea while Isis tried to protect the young boy from his wicked uncle Set. Isis while visiting the hiding place of her young son, found him stretched lifeless and rigid on the ground: a scorpion had stung him. Isis after praying to the sun-god Ra for help, Ra sent Thoth to teach Isis the spell by which she could remove the poison of the scorpion from her lifeless son and let air pass into him and he lived. The body of Osiris finally drifted ashore at Byblus, on the coast of Syria as this myth goes. In Byblus where the coffer containing the body of Osiris drifted ashore, a fine erica-tree shot up suddenly and enclosed the chest in its trunk. The king of the country, admiring the growth of the tree, had it cut down and made into a pillar of his house; but did not know that the coffer"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 26 with the dead Osiris was in it. Isis journeyed to Byblus and after a while revealed herself to the king and queen and begged for the pillar of the roof, and they gave it to her. She cut the coffer out of the tree trunk, then she wrapped the trunk of the tree in fine linen, and poured ointment on it, and gave it to the king and queen, and the wood stands in a temple of Isis and is worshipped by the people of Byblus to this day. (This story is strikingly similar to the tree of Mary, Jesus' mother, in Egypt's EL Montareyiya area near old Heliopolis.) Isis put the coffer in a boat and sailed away. Opening the chest she lay her face on the face of her brother kissed him and wept. Isis then hid the coffer and went to see her son Horus. Set found the coffer as he was hunting a boar one night by the light of a full moon. Knowing the body, he rent it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them abroad. Myths merge and diverge here regarding the fourteen parts of the body of Osiris. Some say that Isis buried each limb as she found it, but others will have it that she buried an image of him in every city, pretending it was his body, in order that Osiris might be worshipped in many places and that if Seth searched for the real grave he might not be able to find it. Could the body of Osiris be in the Great Pyramid? However most myths say, the genital member of Osiris had been eaten by the fish, so Isis made an image of it instead, and the image is used by the Egyptians at their festivals to this day. Could the Great Pyramid be his fortress? Diodorus Siculus, the historian, wrote \"Isis recovered all the parts of the body except the genitals; and because she wished that her husbands grave should be unknown and"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 27 honored by all who dwell in the land of Egypt, she resorted to the following device. She molded human images out of wax and spices, corresponding to the stature of Osiris, round each one of the parts of his body. The ancient Egyptians believed that the story of Osiris revealed the secrets of the resurrection of their own soul. As noted, these secrets are infolded within the symbolism of the Pillar of Osiris. Osiris in his KARAST or CHRIST body."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 28 A key fact emerges. Osiris was Egypt’s first mummy. He is portrayed on one of the shrines of Tutankhamun in his mummified form. Mummy is the Egyptian term for a body bound or wrapped . One term for this is Karast , which Gerald Massey notes in Light of Egypt , may be the origins of the Greek term Christ . If we can re-discover the principles of the science built up around this pillar/resurrection machine and match them to the human body I believe we can, once again, perform the Great Work and become star walkers. These are the secrets everyone on Earth is seeking. These secrets are in Egypt."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 29 3. THE EYE IN THE PYRAMID The Great, the Mighty God ...hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day. Jer. 32:18-20 Like all the Mysteries, the Secrets of the huge pyramids of Giza, with their triangular sides and square bases, are three-fold: they are religious, philosophical and scientific. Some believe the builders of the pyramids derived their architectural ideas and techniques from Divinely inspired sources. Described as an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Lord in Isaiah 19:19, some say Giza’s pyramids were built by gods or by God. The word pillar is one that I’d like to go into here since it’s so pertinent to my exploration. According to Webster’s Dictionary , the English word ‘pillar’ comes from the Latin pila , meaning ‘column’. Like pole , pillar is very close to the Old Testament word pala , which the biblical authority Strong’s Concordance defines as “to be marvelous, be extraordinary, be beyond one” and “power to do, do wonderful acts.” Pala is used primarily with God as the subject, expressing actions that are beyond the bounds of human powers or expectations (Psalm"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 30 118:23). Intriguingly, deliverance from Egypt – the Exodus -- was the result of God’s wondrous ( pala ) acts says Exodus 3:20. Interestingly, the Celtic word for spirit is poell , and poele is French for stove ; suggesting that the Great Pyramid could be some form of ‘fiery furnace’, the term used for the gateway in which the Son of God appears in the book of Daniel. (In a moment I will compare pole with columba or column . Columba means ‘dove’. At the baptism of Christ recorded in Mt 3:16, Mk 1:10, Lk 3:22 and Jn 1:32, the heavens are supposed to have opened and a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, or poell , to have descended to the words, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.” ) All of these terms apply to the pile of stones we call the Great Pyramid. It is indeed a wondrous pla tform beyond the bounds of human powers, and some believe, it is capable of opening a door that delivers the faithful out of Egypt. If one interprets ‘Egypt’ as an overall term for earth life, one might conjecture that the Giza Pla teau is a limestone pla ted doorway that provides an exit from earth life. It is a place to pass over or pass through to another, more plea surable, realm (the Gnostic called Ple roma). There’s pl enty more we could add to this pla y on pala words. But let’s look at another. In Architects of the Underworld Bruce Rux notes that the actual Egyptian term for the pyramids was mer , meaning “Place of Ascension,” which he claims is a reference to the soul’s ascension. Mr is a key tone. It is the Egyptian determinative for pyramid. It is composed of the elements Ma – mother -- and Ur – light."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 31 Its determinative glyph is a cobra, which says Harold Bayley in The Lost Language of Symbolism , is the special keeper of concealed secrets , especially subterranean gold . Noted early 20 th century British Egyptologist E.A. Wallis Budge says mer means both “waters” and “motherly love”. Ta-Mera was another name for ancient Egypt. MR or Mer is one of those all around power root words appearing in such names as Mercury , Meroduk (or Meru- dook, son of E.A.), and mermaid (‘fish-human’). Amor (‘love’) is the name of the Cathar religion. Considering the extraordinary use of puns and allegories in Egyptian symbolism, it is possible that the “Big Fish” that swallowed Jonah (the Greek Iona, or dove ) was the Great Mer or Pyramid. Later, Jesus said he would imitate Jonah, spending three days in the belly of the “Big Fish”. It is significant that the double appellation of “Messiah” and “Dag” (Hebrew for fish) should so well apply to the Great Pyramid. Mer is the root for the name of the symbolic primordial mountain, called Meru or Su-Meru . This symbol, , a triangle or pyramid topped by a circle, is the simple symbol for the cosmic mount Meru. It matches the Masonic symbol of the ‘All Seeing Eye of God’ atop the pyramid on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States of Mer- Ica (America). In his mystery tome Morals and Dogma , Masonic historian Albert Pike made the intriguing claim"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 32 that all the pyramids and artificial tumuli and hillocks thrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous and mystic mountain, for purposes of worship. Meru, says Pike, was said to terminate in three peaks , a symbol of the Trimurti – the three-in-one or the Trinity. Likewise, the Giza Plateau terminates in three primary peaks or ‘heads’. Another relevant place name that shares the Mer root is Su-Mer or Su- Meria. Interestingly, the word pala appears in the extraordinary and highly popular story of the Sumerian goddess Mari who donned her Pala (‘miracle’) garment along with her oracular helmet, the Shugurra (literally translated by Zecharia Sitchin in The 12 th Planet as “that which makes go far into the universe”) and ventured into the Underworld. In Egypt, this is the realm of Osiris. In the depiction shown on the next page, Mari, also known as Is-Tara, is portrayed wearing her Pala garment and standing before the Pillar of Life. Hovering above this pillar or pole is a winged disk called the Mer -Ka-Ba or Ma- a’she in Jewish mysticism where it is a symbol of the soul. (More on this later.) Like the Greek goddess Pallas -Athena, Mari performs the ‘lifting of the serpent’ ceremony (next page) later performed in the story of Moshe or Moses . When Moses lifted the serpent this was a form of crucifixion that foreshadowed the appearance of the Messiah, Jesus. In the Book of Numbers (21), I Am (Jehova) said to Moses, “ Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole :"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 33 and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looks upon it shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.” Jesus himself makes reference to the serpent on a pole symbolism: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up” (John 3:14). This statement appears to equate the Son of Man, the Messiah who comes through the door, with the Egyptian symbolism of Osiris. Why? Is-Tara or Mari stands before the Pillar of Light with a disk hovering above."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 34 The serpent and pillar combination is repeated here.

If we compare pole with columba or column an answer to our question of why the symbolism of Osiris, Moses and Jesus are linked (and a link to the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus) is provided. Columba (pillar, column, I) means ‘dove’ and Iove (which is an I or column, plus ‘ove’) was another spelling for Jehovah, the serpent god of Moses. The dove was the holy bird of I-stara/Mari (shown on page 33). Her serpent is the symbol of Wisdom. Interestingly, the word Easter , the holy day celebrating the resurrection of Jesus, is derived from Is-Tara. The equation of the pillar of crucifixion with the column or dove of the goddess is complete. At the baptism of Jesus the heavens are supposed to have opened and a dove ( columba , pillar ), the symbol of the Holy Spirit, to have descended to the words,“This is my"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 36 beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.” Interpreted in light of the symbolism we have examined, this statement is declaring that Jesus is either the pillar itself or the serpent that emerges from within in it or floats upon it . THE GREAT PYRAMID AND JACOB’S LADDER As we can see, the English word pillar connects us to some of the greatest mysteries of all time. There is more. In a fascinating article on the Consciousevolution.com website Australian researcher Simon Miles has noticed that the Hebrew word translated as “pillar” is the word “matstsabah”; spelled in Hebrew Mem-Tsadey-Beth-He . This catches my attention as in its simplified form matstsabah is mast -ab-a. It is illuminating to quote the definition of this word as given in Strong’s Concordance . Under matstsebah, it reads: “something stationed, i.e. a column or memorial stone, by analogy an idol; garrison, standing image or pillar ” (italics mine). Matstsebah, says Strong’s , is a participle of ‘natsab ’: a station, a military post. From these definitions it can be seen that the word that appears in the English translation, i.e. pillar, directs us to the meaning contained in the Hebrew of a standing image, or possibly a human figure (an ‘I’). Incredibly, it may have had a military purpose. The picture painted by these definitions raises an important question. Is it possible that the enlightenment"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 37 pillar of Osiris. , was, or more intriguingly, is , housed within an unknown or undiscovered chamber in, beneath or even atop the Great Pyramid? One of the key tools bible researchers employ to fully explain a word or phrase is to trace its earliest appearance. In so doing it is hoped that the original meaning of the word or phrase will become clear. Employing this literary technique leads to a fascinating take on our question. I was fascinated, to say the least, when Simon Miles pointed out that the word matstsebah makes its first appearance in the bible in the story of Jacob’s Ladder, recorded Genesis chapter 28. This is highly important, since Jacob’s Ladder is often considered to be another term for Osiris’s pillar or ladder. Several of my books have dealt with Jacob’s journey upon this mysterious flight of stairs. I consider it to be one the pivotal episodes in the Old Testament. The depiction shown here of the pharaoh ascending a flight of fourteen steps to the awaiting celestial boat of the gods at the Temple of Edfu in Egypt excellently portrays this event. The pharaoh ascends the stairway to have. From Description De L’Egypte, 1798."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 38 The pharaoh ascends the stairway to heaven. Relief from the temple of Edfu, Egypt. In this work I’d like to interpret this episode as a reference to the Great Pyramid, the House of the Holy Spirit. In this amazing incident, Jacob, who had arrived at “a certain place”(Gen 28:11), lays his head on a stone pill- ow and falls asleep. He dreams of a ladder set up on the earth with the top reaching to heaven (v.12). ( The word translated ladder is salam , from salal , raised, elevated, reared up, exalted, piled up into a heap.) The malak elohim – the angels of God -- ascend and descend on it. From atop the ladder God calls to Jacob. He promises that the land on which he is sleeping will be his and that his descendents shall be blessed . 26 When Jacob awakens he makes the following awestruck observations: “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.” And he was afraid and said ‘How terrible is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.’” Genesis 28:16-17"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 39 Jacob then arises and takes the stone pillow and sets it up as a pillar , or in Hebrew, a matstsebah, pours oil on top of it and names the place Beth-el , which means, House of God. “And this stone, which I have set for a pillar , shall be God’s house ,” says Jacob in Genesis 28:22. This is the first time in the bible that this word matstsebah makes its appearance. These verses describe the location as God’s House. Significantly, Genesis says the place where Jacob set up his ladder/pillar/heap, the location of “God’s House”, was originally called Luz . This is an important piece of information. According to the French symbolists Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrant writing in The Penguin Dictionary of Symbols , in Jewish folklore, it is at the foot of the almond-tree (also called the luz tree or Tree of Light ) that access can be obtained to the mysterious city of Luz, an underground city which is one of the ‘Seats of the Immortals’. Luz was also applied to the indestructible kernel (core, nut) of being which carried within itself the seeds of its own resurrection. In esoteric tradition, note the French symbolists, the almond is the nut of immortality. It symbolizes the secret (a treasure) which is hidden in some dark place and which must be discovered in order to nourish the finder. The husk around the almond, they say, is compared to a wall or gate. In other words, if we find the secret of Luz do we find the gate and a hidden treasure? Is this Giza? According to Herodotus, the Giza Plateau is honeycombed with underground passages leading to other pyramids and a labyrinth composed of more than 1,500 rooms. (For some"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 40 reason the song “Eight miles high” comes to mind, only I’m hearing it as “eight miles down”.) It is curious in the extreme that the sacred almond shape , the Ru glyph, called the vesica piscis or the (“Big”) fish by the first Gnostic Christians, is the Egyptian glyph for Ru , the suffix of Aa-ru, the Field or ‘Domain’ of the Blessed. The horizontal almond, the , is the Egyptian hieroglyphic for neter . It is the Mayan glyph for ‘galaxy’. It looks like a vibrating string. From the accumulation of all these perceptions one wonders if Luz is an actual subterranean city beneath Cairo and if the Giza Platform is the bridge or interface. Or, if Luz is the bridge between the earthly world and the inner world of neter-neter land (the Milk Way galaxy) and the Great Giza Platform is a limestone plated or armored entrance to a device, a (star)gate, that opens a holy hole in the galaxy . Whatever actually happened to Jacob at Bethel – whether he ascended to a heavenly realm or descended to a city beneath Cairo -- this experience took place while Jacob was in an altered state of consciousness described as a “dream”. This was no ordinary dream, however. Jacob"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 41 believed the experience was real. Angels ascended and descended upon the ladder that he saw. The Lord appeared to him. The key feature of this mystical experience is that it occurred while Jacob’s head rested upon the stone. Later, he specifically identified this stone with the pillar, or matstsebah. Again, I am speculating this may be the Great Pyramid, what Jacob specifically labeled the House of God. (It could also be the temple at Denderah. More on this later.) If this was no ordinary dream, and the stone was not a pillow in the usual sense of the word, then Jacob’s story is describing, in symbolic language, a spiritual or initiatory process in which he placed his skull in a certain posture (‘laid his head’) in relation to the Pyramid, and had his mind altered by the 2 million stones that comprise the structure. As a result, he experienced a sequence of extraordinary events, which he clearly understood to be real. He went to an ‘underground’ or ‘inner’ city... How does one ‘lay’ his head in relation to the Great Pyramid? As I have explored elsewhere, I believe the stone Jacob used for a pillow was actually a (s)tone, that is, a key, note ( ), tone, frequency or vibration, perhaps emitted from a vibrating string, , that altered his brainwaves. This wave altered his brain waves and enhanced his spiritual vision, making him holy or whole . This wave connected Jacob with a heavenly world (remember, mer the Egyptian term for the pyramids means ‘mother waters’, a term which"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 42 implies waves) and enabled him to see God ( in Chinese characters). One possible location within the Great Pyramid where Jacob may have laid his head and had his brainwaves altered in this manner is the King’s Chamber. I base this speculation on an experience shared by all in my group in the King’s Chamber. The Pyramid seemed to be humming. Where this humming was coming from is unknown. Standing in the King’s Chamber talking with my group we speculated that the sound we were experiencing could be the pulse of the earth or even the solar system oscillating in the red granite sound box. Did our footsteps somehow ring the bell of the pyramid as we ascended the Grand Gallery? Consulting Christopher Dunn’s revolutionary work The Giza Power Plant when I returned home, I was fascinated to learn that the monolithic blocks of red granite out of which the King’s Chamber is constructed is an igneous rock containing silicon quartz crystals. Hauled several hundred miles from the quarry in Aswan, some researchers believe this rock, composed of 55 percent or more quartz crystal, is a tuner of an induction field . Dunn notes the discovery of Egypt explorer Boris Said that an acoustical analysis of the floor of the King’s Chamber revealed that the flooring blocks are not sitting on solid masonry. Instead, they are freestanding as if they were designed to vibrate. It is no wonder, he says, that the entire chamber “rings” while tourists walk around inside. In fact, Dunn compares the Great Pyramid to a musical instrument and even to a concert hall!"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 43 Not only did I experience the hum inside the King’s Chamber, but also I had an incredible spiritual experience. It happened after our group quieted down and silence descended upon the chamber. I slid my back along the smooth granite wall facing the entrance. I closed my eyes to meditate and visualized myself at the center of the earth’s land masses. From within my heart I sent out a pulse of love, hoping to connect with my family back home. A moment later, still meditating, I was confounded by an amazing experience. A ‘smiling blue eye’ unexpectedly appeared in my mind’s eye. I call it the ‘smiling blue eye’ because it was pulsing bliss at me. It seemed to ‘bounce’ in the blackness and may have been accompanied by a second eye. It clearly appeared to be sentient. I felt perplexed afterward and asked the members of the group if any one had seen what I had seen. No one had. This experience left no doubt in my mind that the Temple of Giza is a machine for contacting a Divine Being. Afterwards, I learned this ‘smiling eye’ was the blue eye of Horus and is a symbol of the Egyptian mystery schools. The Masonic symbol of the All-Seeing Eye on top of the pyramid encapsulates this teaching. Later on in the tour, I found a golden plastic pyramid souvenir in the gift shop at Luxor. Standing only two inches tall there isn’t much that is special about this trinket except that it has a blue eye of Horus placed exactly where the King’s Chamber is located in the Great Pyramid! From this, I wondered if it was possible that I had some form of standard Great Pyramid experience. It seemed to me as if the blue eye of Horus is the logo for the software program"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 44 that runs the hardware of the Pyramid. ‘Clicking on’ this icon opens the secrets of the Pyramid. Seeing the ‘smiling blue of Horus’ was a mighty profound experience for me, particularly in light of the research I first noted in my book God Making . That is, the story of Jacob’s Ladder finds a fascinating parallel with the retina of the human eye . (Interestingly, the shape of the human eye, , is the symbol for the neter.) “The retina”, says Gray’s Anatomy , is a “delicate nervous membrane, upon the surface of which the images of external objects are received.” The retina is located at the back of the eye. It acts as a net for capturing light. The retina consists of ten layers. Nine have complex Latin medical terms. The tenth is called “Jacob’s Layer.” Why does the non-anatomical term ‘Jacob’s Layer’ label one layer of the retina of the eye? Is there a little known spiritual or mystical function to this part of the eye? In another famous story Jacob wrestled with an angel and saw God face to face at a place called Peniel . Mystics consider the pineal gland the ‘god part’ of the brain. The pineal is part of the ‘triple sanctuary’ of the brain that includes the anterior and posterior pituitary and the mysterious pineal. These glands are the three ‘stars’ of the brain, corresponding with the three peaks of Giza. Earlier, I noted that Giza could be a marker for the mysterious underground city of Luz. In The Lost Language of Symbolism Harold Bayley notes that the Latins called the almond amygdala , “the mighty Sun.” Its Hebrew name was – get ready -- luz . The amygdala is also found in the brain.

I find it utterly amazing and incredibly informative the way in which the bible can be interpreted in light of human anatomy. In fact, I believe the bible describes the process of ‘kick starting’ the human resurrection machine. For those seeking further information on this topic, in several of my books, beginning with God Making and continuing especially in Cloak of the Illuminati , I have compared the Pillar of Osiris to the human body. In Oracle of the Illuminati I described the process whereby the Pillar of Osiris was used as an antenna to channel the vibration or key of life from the Milky Way’s ‘G-Spot’ or God Spot, transforming this device into a column or pillar of light. This oscillation or wave of light, , created a beneficial environment for the Oracle – a ‘house’ for the god. Creating this holy house, the Luz, I concluded, is the spiritual function of the human body. Did Jacob set up the Pillar of Osiris, a sonic technology whose logo features a serpent/string, and did he pluck this string sending harmonious tones into the vicinity of the pillar, making it a ‘blessed’ environment? Did this string ‘tie the thread’ (the connecting wormhole ) between Earth and the heavenly realm he ascended to?"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 46 It is extremely noteworthy, as Simon Miles points out, that Jacob’s story is also the first time in the Bible that the term “House of God” is employed. What is this “House of God”? Jacob provides the answer directly several verses later. “This (s)tone”, says Jacob, “which I have set up for a pillar (or matstsebah), “shall be God’s House” (Genesis 28:22). So the answer is clear: the matstsebah is the House of God and the House of God is the Tone of Life. How can a ( s)tone be a house? Only if there is an antenna within the stone in which the dweller of the house can dwell. Miles notes that the definitions of the word ‘pillar’ found in Strong’s strongly implies that there is within the Great Pyramid, hidden from external view, a pillar in the shape of a standing figure; that the figure represents “the Lord” (= Osiris), and that he is therefore “housed” within the pyramid. To me, this suggests the Pillar of Osiris is to be found there. This is the location of the Gate to Heaven opened by this pillar. Recall what Jacob exclaimed: This is the ‘House of God’ and the ‘gate of heaven’. I agree with Miles’ conclusion that these passages in Isaiah and Genesis imply that the House of God described in Genesis is to be found among the three stars on the plateau at Giza. The Great Pyramid is the “stone” which Jacob set up, and it is capable of creating a tone that is the dwelling place of the Lord. I would suggest that the pillar Jacob set-up was his body. The oil he used to anoint this pillar was a secretion of a secret substance from this three"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 47 inner stars: the anterior and posterior pituitary and the pineal glands. Here, it is worth noting that on numerous occasions Egyptian guides told me that Christianity is the re-tooled religion of ancient Egypt. The true Christian baptism is an Egyptian initiation ceremony. My research had revealed as much. Interestingly, in the Bard Language, the word Giza or (G) Iza enfolds the Christian meaning of the pyramids. De- mystifying this word we find that , a ‘G’ on its side, is a sign in the Egyptian hieroglyphic system representing the land of Egypt , as well as ‘shelter’, ‘home’. Importantly, the Masons symbolize their craft with the letter G and claim to possess the secrets of Jesus – Issa in India. In Masonic symbolism, the “G” is the symbol of the Divine Architect. According to Hunbatz Men writing in Secrets of Mayan Science and Religion , to the Mayans the “G” symbolizes the cosmic egg, zero, love and galaxy. (Once again the egg is the musical notation for the whole note. One ancient Egyptian name for Giza is the “egg of creation.”) The second half of our split G- iza - Iza or Isa - is a compound of two words Is or Isis and Sa or Za . The Egyptian word Sa means wisdom , soul , to watch . As a title Sa was applied to the Egyptian savior god of resurrection Osiris or O-Sa(r) and meant ‘shepherd’. I had long heard that the (G) Issa was used as a Temple of Initiation, an oracle, for inculcating the mysteries of nature and the innermost powers of the soul. This is"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 48 probably why ten million people a year ‘flock’ to Egypt and the ‘Shepherd’s Cross’ at (G)Issa. From Jacob’s experience with the ladder, the likes of which appears nowhere else in the Bible, we may assume several key points. The Great Pyramid is a ‘chamber of secrets’. Hidden within the Great Pyramid may be a hidden pillar in the shape of a human form, the Lord. It is possible for a human to mimic this pillar’s principles to put oneself in atonement or attunement with the Lord. The application of these principles kick-starts a transformation of the human body that leads to the enhancement of mental and spiritual perception that enable them to observe higher dimensions of reality. This opens the stairway to heaven. As Simon Miles observes, we can also say that the figure represented by the pillar is the Lord = Osiris himself, so that the process of glimpsing heaven involves the establishment of a temporary identification between the human in the role of Jacob, and the human pillar figure in the role of the Lord. This “certain place” therefore is the location of a specific instrument or tuner by which a person may place their body in resonance with the Lord and pass through a gate to heaven. This, then, is the answer to the age-old riddle of the purpose of the Great Pyramid: it is the House of God, and the gate of heaven."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 49 It is indeed a resurrection machine ; a ladder by which a human may climb up into heaven itself. This is the greatest show on Earth. These assumptions open an opportunity to apply the numerous references within the bible to the House of God to the spiritual functioning of the human body and the means by which it can open the “gate of heaven.” To capitalize on this opportunity, we may include the appearance of the key “pillar/gateway” terms from Genesis 28 throughout the bible. One key example of a reference to the transformation of an ordinary human via the principles of this pillar is to be found in the Gospel of John. This will be considered in the next chapter."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 50"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 51 4. THE GREAT PYRAMID AND JOHN’S GOSPEL In the first chapter of the book of John is described the ministry of Jesus and his meeting of the disciples. There is an enigmatic passage that describes the meeting of Jesus and Nathanael, a Galillean who was leery that anything good could have come out of Nazareth. The Galilee is the locus for a good deal of Jesus' ministry and is the heart and soul of Jewish learning from the first and second century onwards. When Jesus meets Nathanael the prophet describes him as “an Israelite in whom is no guile ”. This is widely interprted as a negative term meaning he is deceitful; a charge later made against Pa u l by his detractors who claimed he caught his Corinthian converts (the ‘fish’) by guile. My fish metaphor is informative as Webster’s says ‘guile’ comes from the Old French gil , meaning ‘craft; cunning’. Interestingly, Strong’s says to be without guile is to be “pure.” So, by saying Nathanael has no guile, he could be indicated he is a pure one. Apparently surprised and willing to question Jesus’s authority, Nathanael responds by saying “when knowest thou me?” When did you know me? Jesus answers directly: “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig-tree , I saw you”."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 52 This was an extremely meaningful reply for Nathanael expresses his astonishment and takes this as sufficient proof that Jesus is, indeed, the Son of God and King of Israel. In response, Jesus tells Nathanael he hasn’t seen anything yet. In fact, Jesus tells him that “you shall see greater things than this... you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son or man ” John 1:43-51. These words could have been directly lifted from the words of Jacob in Genesis 28, when he saw the angels ascending and descending upon the ladder setup on earth, the gate of heaven, with the Lord standing on, above, or next to, the procession. As an apparent reward for correctly identifying Jesus as the King of Jews, Jesus would appear to be promising Nathanael that he will also experience what Jacob saw. (Jacob’s vision, we have seen, may have taken place at the Great Pyramid.) Nathanael, we are told, lives in Galilee, a very remote area along the borders and frontiers of modern Lebanon. It is traditionally thought of as a sleepy little town and is obviously a long way from Egypt and the Great Pyramid. However, is it possible to link the greatest show on Earth at Giza to Jesus’s promise to Nathanael? I believe it is. Tracing the meaning of the word Galilee turns the key that opens this door. According to Godfrey Higgins, Galilee or gl-al- ia means country of the circle or revolution . Indeed, the Galilee region was known for being a hotbed of political activity and some of it violent. It was the '60s Berkeley of Palestine, a center of revolutionary thought. Jesus was the leader of the revolution."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 53 Interestingly, as Harvard Divinity School professor Alan D. Callahan points out, the Galilee became famous for its bandits. We hear of a number of other characters during this period who reflect this growing social banditry and political protest. They are the last in a line of ‘god men’ who appeared during the first century of the first millennium AD. The historian Josephus tells of one of the most interesting, and famous cases, that of an enigmatic messianic character known as The Egyptian. We don't know his real name. He seems just to have come from Egypt. But according to Josephus, he's someone who had magical powers and garnered an enormous following among the popular folk. At one point he led a mass of people up on the Mount of Olives, literally looking down into Herod’s rebuilt Temple of Solomon from across the way. And Josephus says that as a kind of messiah (whom Josephus calls a false prophet) this Egyptian promised them that he would lead these common people into Jerusalem and take the Temple (where I propose the Pillar of Osiris was secretly house). They would make him their King, and they would, in turn, become his royal honor guard. In c. 54 AD the Romans led by Felix employed their standard response to this kind of individual. They immediately dispatched the cavalry, and any special forces support units of the military at hand. Their response is quick and certain. Go first for the leader, chop off the head of the serpent, and disperse the rest. The leader is usually arrested, or executed on the spot. The rest of the mob, as they appeared to be to the Romans, would have been dispersed, in some cases with a great deal of brutality."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 54 The Egyptian seems to have escaped in this case. Two hundred or more others did not. And so, the Egyptian is a kind of a namesake of someone who lives on in the memory for a number of years, precisely because he wasn't executed. The word Galilee offers several additional word meanings with fascination connections to the topic of this essay. For instance, Gal is a monolith (literally ‘stone of light’). Gala in Greek is milk and is the root of galaxy . In Galilee we have the idea of a stone of light and the milk of the spinning Milky Way galaxy. The stone upon which Jacob laid his head in Genesis 28, and which he anointed with oil ( chrestos to the Essenes), was a Gil-Gal . As we have seen a strong case can be made that it was the Great Pyramid House of God (El). Achieving the initiation of the Great Pyramid is the goal of all spiritual work. Gerald Massey notes that in various legends the celestial pole is imaged as a pillar of glass or other slippery substance (which symbolizes the difficulty of reaching into heaven). One is reminded that the Great Pyramid was once covered with shiny Tura limestone giving its exterior the appearance of glass. Polished, sheer and smooth the Pyramid would have been nearly impossible to climb. The implication would appear to be that the altered mode of consciousness, which Jacob tapped in to, is now accessible via other techniques. It may be more than a subtle clue to notice the explicit connection to the fig-tree in this context."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 55 I have previously explored the myths and legends of the fig tree in Cloak of the Illuminati and will highlight a few here. It was the Tenah or Taneh , the “fig-tree” leaves that Adam and Eve applied to cover their nakedness after they acquired knowledge (Greek nous , noe ). The verb Tan also signifies “to lie down with,” “to bow down” “to copulate,” another of Adam and Eve’s infractions. “Now learn a parable of the fig ,” Jesus taught in Matthew, as he describes an End Time scenario. “Two shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken, the other left.” The Gospels says Jesus cursed the fig tree, which can only be the Pillar of Osiris. Church authorities probably inserted this story as a scarecrow device to thwart pretenders to the throne from looking to the pillars of Egypt. Mythologist Barbara Walker notes in her Woman’s Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets that the fig was always female, its heart-shaped leaves representing the conventional form of the yoni. The yoni is symbolized by the ru or almond shaped vesica pisces, . Walker further notes that Is-Tara also took the form of the holy fig. The fig tree also figured prominently in the legend of Buddha, who was protected by the Bo Tree of Enlightenment, or Tree of Wisdom, ficus religiosa , the Holy Fig, when he received his enlightenment. The fig tree was also appropriately called pala . In Cloak of the Illuminati I traced the myths of the fig to mystic Mount Meru and to the layout of the Tennessee Bicentennial Capital Mall, a 2200 foot long ‘pillar of light’"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 56 laid out on 19 acres in Nashville, Tennessee. Interestingly, it is topped by three stars or peaks, just like Giza. It maybe that to “sit under the fig-tree” is allegorically to take ones place in the matstsebah, and to experience by some related method the “dream” of Jacob. Or it may be it refers to apprehending the secrets of the Pillar of Osiris. If this is so, then this is intriguing confirmation to be found connecting this idea with the Great Pyramid as the House of God in the prophecies of Micah, one of the so- called minor phrophets of the Old Testament. In chapter four, echoing words which also appear in the book of Isaiah, it is stated that: “It shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains”. Micah 4:1 If instead of the word “highest” we use the valid alternative reading of “chief” or “head” of the mountains, then this prophecy would appear to indicate that in the “latter days”, whenever they shall be, the house of the Lord, that is, the Head of Osiris, , concealed within the Great Pyramid, will again be restored to its former position as the “chief” mountain on Earth. If this reading be allowed, then the fourth verse of this fourth chapter of Micah also takes on added significance. It follows a description of life during these “latter days”, and states"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 57 that:” they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree”. Here then is an explicit link between the Pyramid and the concept of sitting beneath the fig-tree, the enlightenment tree or pillar, , which may be a reference to a future time when access to the gate of heaven is freely available to all men without the need to undergo the complete process within the Great Pyramid as Jacob did. There is much more to be gleaned ( gal -eaned) from a re-reading of the Bible, with the understanding that every occurence of the phrase House of God or House of the Lord, or even House of Jacob, is a veiled reference to the Great Pyramid. Further layers of meaning also await a detailed study of the gematria of the terms used to describe it in the scriptures. As an example of this, to conclude his short essay, Miles says it is noted that the letters of the word matstsebah add up to 137, whilst the letters of the word used for “ladder” in the Hebrew add up to 136. As the rules of gematria allow equality under a difference of one (known as colel ), this provided further additional confirmation that the pillar is indeed the same as the ladder."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 58 This connection between the Great Pyramid, the ladder and the number 137 is particularly relevant to my research. As I wrote in The Crystal Halls of Christ’s Court , physicists call the number 137 alpha . Quantum physicists have suffered enormous angst over the number 137. In his book The God Particle , Nobel laureate Leon Lederman tells us 137 is the inverse of something called the fine-structure constant. This number is related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon.” 11 It is arrived at by taking the square of the charge of an electron divided by the speed of light times h , Planck’s constant. What professor Lederman, who discovered several pieces of the atomic puzzle and was once the Director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, says all this means is that the number 137 “contains the crux of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (the h ).” 12 Physicists call it a pure number. (In the code it is a or peri number.) Lederman notes that Werner Heisenberg once declared himself the protagonist of the position that all the questions of quantum mechanics would disappear when 137 was finally explained. Wolfgang Pauli, he says, was so tormented by the mystery of 137 that it bordered on obsession. Why is alpha equal to 1/137? The solution to this mystery eluded him. Synchronistically, 137 was the hospital room number in which Pauli spent his last remaining earthly hours contemplating this mystery."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 59 The essence of the experimental method is the ability to make predictions based upon the existing data. I predict that, as a pure number related to the Great Pyramid and the ladder to heaven 137 ought to play a pivotal role in the Christ and Grail story. In fact, it could even offer proof that the Holy Spirit is behind the secrets of the atom. The work of computer scientist Vernon Jenkins noted in Gordon Strachan’s Jesus the Master Builder may have provided the numerical proof I seek in 1984. In a paper entitled ‘The Cracking of a Unique Code’, he presented the results of his independent research into the Gematria of the first verse in the Bible. His computer analysis of Genesis 1:1 revealed regular patterns of numbers and geometry which were so far beyond coincidence that Jenkins claimed they proved the presence of a Divine mind in the authorship of Genesis. The number 37, the compliment of 137 in Gematria, had a disproportionately high rate of incidence throughout the verse: “In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.” The number 37 is the twelfth prime. A prime number is one that is evenly divisible by no other number except 1. The first twelve primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29, 31, and 37. Added together the number value of the first verse of the Bible -- “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” -- equals 2701. This is 37 x 73 (its mirror image). The number 37 appears in a powerful story with many connections to this essay: the story of Joshua appointing twelve men, one from each tribe, to take a stone from the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 60 middle of the Jordan river and bring it to shore on the west bank. The stones were carried to a small mound and there placed in a circle. They were to be a memorial of the Israelite’s deliverance from Egypt. In the story, related in Joshua 4:5-24, the Israelites used the Ark of the Covenant to cut off the waters of the Jordan so that they could pass onto dry land. “And the Lord said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.” (Joshua 5:9) The word Gilgal literally means a wheel or that which is circular. However, and here is the key point, it was also used to mean “rolling way” or a “whirlwind.” Thus the rolling away of the influence of Egypt and the placing of the stones in a circle or a wheel (which indicates spinning or revolving) describe the activity of the place name Gilgal. As numerologist Bonnie Gaunt points out in The Stones and the Scarlet Thread , in the Septuagint, the Greek text of the Old Testament, the name Gilgal has a number equivalent to 370. The circle of Gilgal contained 12 stones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Interestingly, after his Last Supper with the 12 apostles (posts or pillars) Jesus’s next major appointment with destiny was at Gulgotha , a place name very similar to Gilgal . Gulgotha means ‘skull’ or ‘head’ ( ). It is fascinating to point out here that chokmah , the Hebrew word used throughout the Old Testament for"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 61 wisdom totals 37. 37 and its compliment in Gematria, 137, is the number of wisdom. 37 or 370 is the place of wisdom, Gilgal. All of this 37 symbolism has a sensational connection to the Holy Grail. In Gematria , gematrists Bligh Bond and Simcox Lea, two British researchers who extensively researched the number relationships of the Grail mystery, point out that the number 37 can be seen figuratively as a cube . Their interpretation was confirmed by early Gnostic writings dating to 100 AD. Gematrists say 37 is also the prime number of Iesous Christos , the Greek name for Jesus. 16 Because his number is 37 Jesus shares the attributes and symbolic meanings of that number. Christ, in this model, is a cube. In gematria 37 symbolizes wisdom. In quantum physics 137 contains the crux of the wisdom of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (the h ). In the Holy Grail mystery 37 is Jesus H . Christ who holds the crux of all atomic knowledge. The bottom line is the Hebrew book of Genesis 1:1, the Greek name Ieousus Christos , chokmah the Hebrew word for wisdom, and the innermost wisdom of quantum physics are linked by the prime number 37 and the pure number 137. As Isaac Newton neared the end of his earthly days, he too came upon a similar conclusion. He wrote that Jesus, “was the principle of the creation... the agent by whom God created all things in this world .” The body or spiritual form of Jesus Christ was also the incorporeal force that"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 62 facilitates the phenomenon of gravitation, wrote Newton. As noted, the mysteries of Jesus are traced to the head of Osiris. Why the number 37? One explanation emerges from the harmony of 37 in the nine triple numbers. The nine triple numbers 111 through 999 are all multiples of 37. These multiples of 37 are obtained by adding together the three digits composing each number, as follows: 111 = 1+1+1=3 (3 x 37 = 111) 222 = 2+2+2=6 (6 x 37 = 222) 333 = 3+3+3=9 (9 x 37 = 333) 444 = 4+4+4=12 (12 x 37 = 444) 555 = 5+5+5=15 (15 x 37 = 555) 666 = 6+6+6=18 (18 x 37 = 666) 777 = 7+7+7=21 (21 x 37 + 777) 888 = 8+8+8=24 (24 x 37 = 888) 999 = 9+9+9=27 (27 x 37 = 999) In The Western Mysteries David Allen Hulse states, “The secret key to the meaning of 37 in the above is found in Hebrew rather than Greek, for 37 is the value of IChIDH the name for the essential self as the unique point , a title of Kether on the Tree of Life, and a symbol of the point of light or flame of spirit which dwells in every living soul .” In the Ka- ballah, Kether is at the very apex of the inner Tree of Life. It is the brilliant white crown where contact with the Higher Self or the eternal Ka occurs. As Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan notes in Sefer Yetzirah: The Book of Creation , the Hebrew word for “eternal” is Kedem, which usually indicates keter . The Hebrew word for Crown,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 63 Keter, also comes from the root Katar , meaning to “ sur- round .” It is through the attribute of Keter or Kedem (eternity) that God encompasses all space and time. I find the interchange between the words Kether and Cathar most intriguing. It suggests to me that if one wishes to experience God, they must achieve the surrounding crown of the Cathar. That is, they must attune their brainwaves to God. On the inside of these brainwaves is the Tree of Life, the Pillar of Osiris, symbolized by the H . Unless the symbolism of the H is fully understood – it is the ladder to heaven -- the symbolism of the number 37 sails beyond our grasp for meaning. With it, it seems probable beyond a shadow of doubt that the answer that the answer to the riddle of 137 Heisenberg was seeking is Jesus H. Christ. Based upon this I speculate that the 8 or H of the Eucharist is an encoded description of the experience of the healing and transformation of the human body and the expansion of the human mind in preparation for linking with Heaven."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 64"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 65 5. THE WORMHOLE DANCE It was the perfect setting for an unexpected call to adventure and a passage to a higher level of understanding. It was night time on a Nile cruise ship docked in Luxor, the lazy palm-lined resort town in Upper Egypt and I was feeling satisfied after another day in the temples of ancient Egypt and an evening dining on fine Egyptian food. Sipping a glass of cool karkady, the sweet Egyptian tea made from the dried red flowers of the hibiscus flower, I was feeling fulfilled. Just then the phone rang. “Who could that be?” I wondered. On the phone is the cruise ship’s entertainment director inviting us to see a belly dancer in the ship’s lounge. I pass. I don’t ‘do’ corny tourist activities. It makes me feel like an American sucker. Besides, the Super Bowl half-time show/pep rally the ship’s crew put on for us during their introduction upon our arrival was embarrassing enough. Each team member enthusiastically jogged into the room to clapping and dancing to disco music and strobe lights. I felt like I was at an Amway meeting. A few minutes later Egypt rings again. “Everyone on board is gathering in the ship’s lounge for the belly dancer,” says the voice."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 66 Ah, what the hell, I decide. I could use a little exercise. So, I walk downstairs to check out the show. Piling into the comfy C-shaped sofa of the ship’s lounge I ordered a Stella beer and waited for the belly dancing to begin. Three musicians were jamming. With the call of the drum and the colorful keys of glory from an electronic keyboard, suddenly ‘Benny and the Pyramids’ (not their real name) have my feet tapping. They’re not Led Zeppelin, but hey, I think, they’re alright. Still, I looked around the room filled with the Japanese, Spanish and German honeymooners like I did at the junior high dances as a youth: looking to make an appearance and then a fast exit before the dancing starts and these genuine Detroit goods get pulled onto the dance floor to do my variation of the Motown “Cool Jerk”. Strange how stupid we can act and how unaware we can be of imminent life-changing events. Every quester knows the feeling: a moment, totally unexpected, when the universe sucker punches us. It’s a moment when the sky opens and the whirlwind appears, or the rock spurts water, or the sea parts, and suddenly we are in a whole new world, another level. It’s synchronicity. A synchronicity occurred when Benny and the Pyramids changed their tune, and then, the dancer appeared. Tall. Rail thin. Stoic. He starts to gently spin in place. Oh great, I think. I came downstairs to watch some guy dance? I thought it was going to be a woman dancing. There’s nothing wrong with guys dancing, but I didn’t come to Egypt for this. In that moment, little do I realize how lucky I am."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 67 As I watch the dancer, a whirling dervish, I soon find myself picking my jaw up off the floor. He is performing the alchemical transformational process of ascension I had just spent the past three days lecturing about and had come to the temples of ancient Egypt to explore further. A few brief comments on this subject will help set-up what I witnessed in the dance. The Zohar tells us that when God desired to create the universe He formed all the souls which were destined for the bodies of man and caused all to pass before God in a preliminary judgment. Each soul stood before God and asked to remain in the upper heavens. In each instance God directed them to the place on Earth where their newly formed bodies awaited them. The soul must ascend to the throne or the Merkaba . In ancient art the Merkaba resembles the disk-shaped structure of our galaxy or a UFO. The Mer-Ka-Ba, usually translated as “chariot”, is the vehicle of Light mentioned in the Bible by Ezekiel. It is the most ancient and secret teaching of Kaballah, the collection of Jewish mystic writings. The Merkaba mystics believed they could reach the Throne in a sham anistic ascent, through a series of heavenly halls. I have interpreted these halls as wormholes or ‘halls’ in space."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 68 One of the steps in the process of ascension is the activation of the Mer-Ka-Ba, the vehicle of light that enables connection between the lower and Higher Self and other realms, accessed through the heavenly halls (or holes). Perhaps the most dramatic reference to the Mer-Ka-Ba in the Bible comes from II Kings and the story of Elijah. We read that the Lord sent Elijah, and his disciple and successor Elisha, to a place called Beth-el (II Kings 2:2). Here, the sons or the brotherhood of prophets came out to greet Elijah to take him away from the ‘Head’ ( ?!). 50 of the brotherhood follow Elijah and Elisha to the Jordan river. Elijah and Elisha cross the Jordan. Suddenly a Merkaba of fire appears, and Elijah disappears in a whirlwind. That is it. On the third dimension of reality, the one we’re are tuned to, Elijah has vanished! Before exploring this ‘whirlwind’ two questions should be addressed. Who were those brotherhood of prophets? The Hebrew phrase that describes them is b’naiha-nevi’im , and it appears NOWHERE ELSE in the Bible. This fact alone hints at something very special, perhaps these brotherhoods were ancient Jewish mystery schools, akin to the mystery schools of Egypt and Persia, where inter-dimensional travel was taught. The mystical number of the group, 50, draws a comparison to the 50 Anunnaki who came to earth from heaven in the Sumerian tradition as well as the 50 Argonauts who sailed with Jason in search of the Golden Fleece."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 69 Where is Beth-El? This was same place Jacob had seen the ladder to heaven. Beth-El (meaning ‘House of God’) is also known as Luz (‘light’), which is one of the ‘Seats of the Immortals’. There is only one place on Earth that matches the descriptions given in Genesis. That place is the Giza Pyramids. Most biblical interpreters explain these verses in the following way: Elisha had a “vision” of a war chariot of fire. He hallucinated or “imagined” something chaotic (the “whirlwind”). However, something very profound happens if we interpret this word “whirlwind” as a rotating or counter- rotating field of energy that is the open ‘mouth’ or entrance to the (energy) Field of the Blessed. In this model the concentric rings symbolize not only the pulsing energy of the ‘whirlwind’, , but also the top- down view of a description of the mouth of a wormhole: Artist’s depiction of the ‘mouth’ of a wormhole."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 70 Wormholes are essentially tunnels in space/time.

Compare this drawing of a wormhole with the dancer on pages 77 and 78. Right before my eyes the dervish presents a brightly colored bell-like skirt that, in my western view, becomes a saucer-shaped UFO or Mer-Ka-Ba spinning around his body.

The Persian word darwish (literally: the sill of the door) is accepted in Arabic and Turkish (dervish) to describe the Sufi who is the one who is at the door to enlightenment. Derived from the Persian word ‘ dar’ (door), a dervish is one who is poor (= Pure ?) in the sight of God and in need of His mercy.

Through his spinning he arrives at a place where ego dissolves and a resonance with universal soul comes in. It is believed that the dervish is in prayer and that his body becomes open to receive the energy of God. Perhaps the reason why I am the first to connect the (eastern) dance of the dervish with the (western) wormhole science is because the Al Tanura group represents a break away from the original dervish dance. Traditionally, the Dervishes start by wearing black cloaks symbolizing tombs, upon removal, so they remove themselves from the world. The purpose of the ritual whirling is to empty himself of all distracting thoughts, placing himself in a trance, his body conquering dizziness. He accepts that he is the true instrument of God and therefore he does not question the power that comes and leaves him during the spinning trance. A special ability of these dancers is the ability to spin in a counter clockwise circle in place for hours, his feet forming a never-changing intricate pattern. Twenty to thirty times a minute the dervish twirls for Allah. Adherents believe this tight circular movement represents the universe, which stems from a single, spinning point . Their twirling is a form of prayer, a method of tapping into hyperconsciousness and an act of love. It may even have been the secret initiatory round dance performed by Jesus. (For more please see Max Pulver’s article “Jesus’s Round Dance and Crucifixion According to the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 82 Acts of St John” in The Mysteries (in Papers From the Eranos Yearbook, ed. Joseph Campbell.) When I talked with the dancer after his performance he told me the ‘story’ told by the dance concerned the unity of heaven and earth. The circle is perhaps the most ancient of mystical symbols and the most universal of all dances. It is the earth and the sun in eternal movement, an unbroken, unbent line symbolizing continuity and eternity. The circle dance represents the wholeness of things, the roundness of pregnancy, the breasts, vessels, egg and temple. The dance brings life full circle. As the dance progresses a baby soul descends from the wormhole into creation. I have collected art from several traditions, including the Christian and the Buddhist examples on the following pages that portray this concept. In the first painting Mary brings the baby Jesus through the mouth of or gate of the universe, the almond-shaped vesica pisces.

While it appears to be in the womb the child is actually in the space/time between the place of its origin and the earth, which is represented by the craggy rock in the lower left corner. They baby floats in mid air in transparent bubble, its body wrapped by a reddish scarf that trails beneath the bubble, point to the craggy earth. The rope-like appearance of this scarf is important. Mayan prophecy says a serpent rope (or wormhole according to scholar John Major Jenkins) will appear at the of the galactic winter solstice alignment of 2012). Is this the umbilical cord of the Great Mother? There is a very interesting connection between the whirling dervish (doorway, wormhole) dance and the traditions of the Great Mother . According to mythologist Barbara Walker, Sufism is an Arabic mystical system preserving within Islam a Tantric form of Goddess-and- woman worship. This is apparent in the dance. The whirling Dervishes trace their origin to the 13th century Ottoman Empire mystic Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi (d. 1273), a native of Afghanistan who is considered one of the greatest mystics and spiritual poets of all time. They are also known as the Mevlevi Order, adherents to the religion of love. Mevlana means ‘our guide’. Rumi was reared by his father, a religious scholar, to become a highly trained spiritual teacher. In his thirties he was widely known as an eminent professor of religion. All his education was preparing him for his encounter with a spiritual guru known as the Shams of Tabriz. This was the central event of Rumi’s life."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 87 At the age of thirty-seven Mevlâna met the spiritual vagabond Shams. Much has already been written about their relationship. Suffice it say, after this ‘attunement’ he became an inspired poet and a great lover of humanity. Rumi’s meeting with Shams can be compared to Abraham’s meeting with Melchizedek, the founder of Jesus’s priesthood, the Order of Melchizedek. I owe to Murat Yagan this explanation: “A Melchizedek and a Shams are messengers from the Source. They do nothing themselves but carry enlightenment to someone who can receive, someone who is either too full or too empty.” Fascinatingly, as authors including Zecharia Sitchin and Laurence Gardner have pointed out, the letters SHM of Sham denotes that which is high or heaven ward! It is the root of shaman . The Mevlevi, or Mevleviye, one of the most well- known of the Sufi orders, was founded in 1273 by his followers after his death, particularly his son, Sultan Veled Celebi. The Mevlevi, or “The Whirling Dervishes”, believe that union with God can be attained in a dance and music ceremony called sema (which is very close to shema ). Sema represents a mystical journey of man’s spiritual ascent through mind and love to “Perfect.” Turning towards the truth, his growth through love, desert his ego, find the truth and arrive to the “Perfect,” then he return from this spiritual journey as a man who reached maturity and a greater perfection, so as to love and to be of service to the whole of creation, to all creatures without discrimination as to belief, race, class or national origin. The Mevlevi Order was outlawed in Turkey at the dawn of the secular revolution by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 88 1923. In the 1950s the Turkish government, realizing that the Whirling Dervishes have value as a tourist attraction, began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform annually in Konya on the Urs of Mevlana -- the anniversary of his death, December 17. In 1974 they were allowed to come to the West. They performed in France, for the Pope, and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and other venues in the US and Canada under the direction of the late Mevlevi Shaikh Suleyman Hayati Dede. Like the European bards and minnesingers who copied them, the Sufi artists exemplified in the woman a “Spirit of the Way” called Fravashi . Sufis believed the universe was held together by feminine forces. Like the Cathars, who were persecuted by the Catholic Church, to survive within the dogmatic patriarchal society, the Sufis disguised their doctrine in allegorical symbols, and established a mystical system in which nearly every tenet was imparted as a graphic image or metaphorical tale. Sir Richard Burton, she says, called Sufism “the Eastern parent of Freemasonry.” The word Sufi is translated from the Arabic work Suf meaning wool or others believe from the Greek word ‘sophos’ meaning wisdom. There are also two fables on how the dance began. The first is loaded with alchemical imagery. It is said the mystical Islamic poet Rumi was walking through the goldsmith area (the alchemists were gold smiths) of Konya in Turkey. He heard beautiful music in the craftsmen’s hammering and began to turn in harmony. In his verses, Rumi emphasized that music uplifts our spirit to realms above, and we hear the tunes of the Gates of Paradise. The meeting places of the dervishes, consequently, became academies of art, music and dance."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 89 The second is the story of a tradesman spinning wool from a bale onto a spindle. In order to prevent the wool from breaking, the spinning movement had to be continuous from the right to the left hand. A story is told of a tradesman in a small village in the East who sat on his knees in his little shop, and with his left hand he pulled a strand of wool from the bale which was above his head. He twirled the wool into a thicker strand and passed it to his right hand as it came before his body. The right hand wound the wool around a large spindle. This was a continuous motion on the part of the old man who, each time his right hand spindled the wool, inaudibly said “la illaha illa’llah” (there is no god but God). There could be no uneven movement or the wool would break and he would have to tie a knot and begin again. The old man had to be present to every movement or he would break the wool. This is awareness. This is life. Sufi means awareness in life, awareness on a higher plan than on which we normally life. A dervish is an apprentice, one who is learning the profession that will provide eternal livelihood. This profession is still taught in certain “schools of higher learning.” While there are many skills that can be self- taught or learned alone, the skills of dervishood are learned by being in relationship to a shaikh, or guide, and within a spiritual family, a Sufi circle. When there is real love between a shaikh and a dervish, the dervish comes into resonance with the wisdom and light of the shaikh, and the shaikh carries some of the burden of the dervish."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"EGYPT: THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 90 The All(ah) from Luxor. The net effect of the training is a direct and personal communion with the All-ah (‘the light’). Sufis begin to conceptualize the All-ah not (only) as a judge and master, but as a friend companion and confidante. This is the relationship shared by Jesus and his disciples. They were friends, companions and supporters of one another in the cosmic dance. One of these disciples, Mary Magdalene, learned to raise the divine child within her and to develop the next level of relationship with Jesus. In mystic Islam the master is called the Pir and the disciple the murid .
