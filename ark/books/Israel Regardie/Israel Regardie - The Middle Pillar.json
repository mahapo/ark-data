Unless a person happened to be a member of a magical organization, there was little chance of leaning the procedures and initiatory practices of high magic. This changed in 1937 when Israel Regardie published four volumes titled The Glh Dm, a collection of ceremonies and teachings from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Earlier, Regardie had published two books d-g i3-w magical prinapJes of the Golden Dawn system. I'le Middle Pik, published in 1938, gave step-by-step details on how to perform practical exercises of ceremonial magic, something which was quite revolutionary for its time. Perhaps even more radical was Regardie's daring attempt to correIate these magical techniques to the (then) new methcds and hypotheses of psychoanalysis. Since the object of study in both magic and psychology was the human mind, it was Regardie's belief that magic could be regarded as a subdivision of the science of psy- &logy. Such a thing was quite unheard of in 1938. In fact, Regardie postulated that psychotherapists could use the techniques of magic, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual and the Middle Pillar exercise of the Golden Dawn, in a dinid setting for the benefit of patients."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"xiv INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD Eurno~ In the mid-1930s Regardie's suggestion would have raised many eyebrows, but today several enlightened therapists are coming to the conclusion that the magicians of old were the psychotherapists of their day. Over the last few years there has been considerable recon- ciliation between occultism and analytical psychology. A large per- centage of ancient magical knowledge is being rediscovered and renamed by modern psychologists for modern times. The \"gods and angels\" of magic are described by the science of mind as \"arche- types,\" while \"demons\" have been converted into \"neuroses.\" The goal of both magic and psychotherapy is the well-being of the indi- vidual-his or her growth and health on every level-physical, men- tal, and psychological. Magic, however, also includes spiritual well-being. Regardie sought to tear down the artificial walls that had been built up between the ancient art and the modern science. Regardie's Die Middle Pillar was a milestone whch boldly stated these ideas long before they became popular. Today the exercise of the Middle Pillar, as a techruque for self-development, has become standard fare-so much so that it is sometimes described in New Age self-help manuals, often without mentioning its source in the Golden Dawn tradition. The Middle Pillar shows the clarity of writ- ing, expertise, and love for teaching that Regardie was famous for. To this day it remains a classic among magical texts. Who was Israel Regardie and why did he write The Middle Pil- lar? The following brief biography should give readers an aware- ness of Regardie's prominent place in the history of modem magic and occultism, as well as his interest in psychology. Before his death in 1985, Israel Regardie was considered by many to be the last living adept of a prestigious magical current known as the Golden Dawn. The tradition represented by the Golden Dawn and its sister spin-off groups, the Stella Matutina and the Alpha et Omega, attracted many influential occultists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Among these were Dr. William W. Westcott, Samuel L. MacGregor Mathers, Arthur Edward Waite, William Butler Yeats, Dion Fortune, and Aleister Crowley. Yet among this extraordinary ensemble of knowledgeable magicians, Regardie ranks high as an authority of prominence."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Third Edition xv Born on November 17,1907, in London, Israel Regardie moved with his family to Washngton, D.C. in 1921 when he was thirteen years old. At an early age he developed an interest in the theosoph- cal works of Madame Blavatsky, Hindu phlosophy, and yoga. At age sixteen Regardie frequented the Library of Congress, which he called hs second home. It was through his contacts in the Library that he was able to find a Hebrew tutor. He learned to read Hebrew fluently, a skill that would aid him tremendously in hs study of Qabalah. About hs time, Regardie enrolled in an art school in Philadelphia. On March 18, 1926 Regardie discovered a newly published book which captivated hs curiosity. The book was Part One of Book Four by Aleister Crowley. Regardie wrote to Crowley in Paris and eventually received a reply to his inquiry, suggesting that he contact Crowley's agent, Karl Germer, in New York. From Germer, Regardie bought a set of The Equinox, a series of magazines that Crowley published from 1909 to 1914. This was the beginning of Regardie's life-long interest in magic and mysticism which changed the course of his whole life, and he soon realized that art was not hs calling. In March of 1926 the young Regardie became a member of the Washington College of the Societas Rosicmciana in America. A year or so later, Crowley offered Regardie a job as his secretary in Paris. Regardie took this as a great opportunity to learn magic from an authority. In order to go to Paris, Regardie had to obtain a passport and a visa. He was still a minor, and was supposed to get permission from hs father for the required documents. However, he never told hs parents about Crowley or his own interest in mysticism. Crowley received a great deal of bad press in both the English and American tabloids, so Regardie was hesitant to tell hs parents that he would be working with Crowley. Since Regardie had attended art school, he simply told them that he had been invited to study painting with an English artist in Paris. His parents gave him documents for the pass- port, but when it came time to obtain the French visa, Regardie typed up the papers himself and signed hs father's name to it. So in October of 1928 at the age of twenty, Regardie went to France to take the post that Crowley offered him. For the next three years Regardie lived a rather nomadic life as he tried to get his employer to teach him the magical arts."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xvi INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION However, Crowley did not offer to teach Regardie magic or yoga and Regardie, a shy and unobtrusive young man, did not press the issue. Instead he continued hs own studies, reading every book or manuscript on these subjects that he could get his hands on. Meanwhile, Regardie's sister, whom he scornfully referred to as \"Nosey Parker,\" read some of Crowley's books and, since she understood nothmg about magic, was appalled. She marched off to the French Consul in Washington and complained about her broth- er's \"demise.\" The French Consul promised to look into the matter. Ths was the beginning of trouble. Four months after Regardie arrived in Paris, a French detective from the Surete Generale came to the apartment \"to see what kind of wicked monster this man Crowley was.\" It just so happened that Crowley owned an unusual glass Silex coffee maker that the detective assumed was used for distilling drugs. The fact that Crowley was the British head of a German magical society (the Ordo Templi Orientis) led police to the false conclusion that Crowley was a German spy. Crowley's problems came to a head when he had a falling out with hs literary press agent who told French police that Crowley was a drug addict. As a result of all ths, Crowley and his wife-to- be, Marie de Miramar, were given expulsion papers. The young Regardie, who had neglected to get a valid residence permit, was also told to leave the country. After spending six months in Brus- sels, Regardie went to England where he stayed with Crowley and his wife. By this time Crowley had discovered another publisher, Mandrake Press, but by now Crowley's notoriety in the tabloids as \"the wickedest man in the world\"1 was enough to cause most booksellers to avoid him, and Mandrake Press soon went under. As a result, Crowley could no longer afford to keep his secretary. After attempting to repair Crowley's tarnished image by co- authoring a book called The Legend of Aleister Crowley (1930), Regardie and Crowley drifted apart though they remained friends. For a time Regardie, who had settled in London, served as a secre- tary for Thomas Burke, the novelist. In 1932, Regardie published hs first two important books, A Gar- den of Pomegranates and The Tree of Life. The former represented"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Regardie's own Qabalistic studies, while the latter is usually consid- ered Regardie's Magnum Opus and one of the most comprehensive texts on practical magic ever written. The book was primarily a restatement of the original teachings of the Golden Dawn and contained very little \"Crowleyanity.\" The Tree of Life was dedi- cated to Crowley under the name of Marsyas, a pseudonym that Crowley used in his poem Aha. About five years later in 1937, Regardie sent his old friend a copy of The Tree of Life with a warm note. Unfortunately, Crowley's response to Regardie's kindness was less than kind-chiding the sensitive young author with an anti-Semitic slur about his recently adopted name of \"Francis\" (a name given to Regardie by a lady friend who thought he had a lot in common with St. Francis of Assisi). Regardie took offense and wrote Crowley an inflammatory letter designed to \"sting\" him- which apparently it did. Crowley retaliated by circulating an abu- sive and slanderous letter about Regardie to all of his friends and acquaintances. The result was a final and complete break between the two men. Regardie was deeply wounded by the breakup of the friendship and was only able to pardon Crowley in his later years. (In 1970, when he wrote The Eye in The Triangle: An Inter- pretation of Aleister Crowley, Regardie's charitable nature and his ability to be forgiving toward his old friend was evident.) The publication of The Tree of Lz$e caused quite a stir in magical circles of the time. In the book Regardie outlined a few of the mag- ical practices and teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Although the original Order had ceased to exist in 1903, it continued to live on in its successors, the Stella Matutina and the Alpha et Omega. Many members of both Orders remembered Crowley as a disruptive insurgent from years before, therefore Regardie's previous connection to Crowley caused some members to lash out at him. Other members, most notably Dion Fortune, defended hm. With her support, Regardie was invited to join the Stella Matutina. In January of 1933, Regardie joined the Order and made rapid progress through the grades, probably due to hs exceptional abilities. However, Regardie was terribly disappointed with the chiefs of the Stella Matutina, who claimed extraordinarily high degrees but seemed sorely lacking in magical knowledge. The"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Order itself was in a state of demoralization and decay-the mem- bers and chefs alike cared little for magic, other than as an irritat- ing prerequisite for examinations in order to obtain exalted titles. Regardie concluded that the teachings of the Order would not survive unless they were published, so shortly after attaining to the grade of Theoricus Adeptus Minor in 1934,2 Regardie left the Order in December of that year. In 1937 he published much of the Golden Dawn's ceremonies and teachings in four volumes titled The Golden Dawn. He clearly stated his reasons for doing this in his previous book My Rosicrucian Adventure (1936) which docu- mented his own experiences with the Golden Dawn: . . .(I)t is essential that the whole system should be publicly exhibited so that it may not be lost to mankind. For it is the heritage of every man and woman-their spiritual birthright. . .. My motives have been to prove without a doubt that no longer is the Order the ideal medium for the transmission of Magic, and that since there have already been sev- eral partial and irresponsible disclosures of the Order teaching, a more adequate presentation of that system is urgently called for. Only thus may the widespread misconceptions as to Magic be removed. Some members of the Order were incensed at this action, but others were quite happy-they no longer had to copy all the Order materials tediously by hand. In Regardie's words, \"Some approved of the publication of these books; a very few disapproved. That's all there is to it.\" Nevertheless most temples of the Stella Matutina and the Alpha et Omega slowly stagnated and died, just as Regardie had predicted. But because of Regardie's actions, all students of magic today owe him an enormous debt of gratitude. According to Francis King and Isabel Sutherland: \"That the rebirth of occult magic has taken place in the way it has can be very largely attributed to the writings of one man, Dr. Francis Israel Regardie.\"3 Regardie made a very difficult and courageous decision to break his oath of secrecy to a lethargic Golden Dawn in order to save the valuable teachings of the Order. Given the fact that many former chiefs had the appalling habit of destroying Order documents rather than passing them on to future generations of initiates, it was the right thg to do. As a result all true seekers, regardless of their edu- cation, background, location, or finances, could benefit from the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Third Edition xix Order's teaclungs. Not only did Regardie's work on the Golden Dawn system ensure that its body of knowledge, sometimes called the Western Esoteric Tradition, would survive long after the original Order had ceased to exist, he is also credited with inspiring the Golden Dawn's modern revival. And of all the initiates who were associated with the original GD or its immediate offshoots (the SM and AO), Regardie, far more than any other person, demonstrated through his life, his work, and his writing, the essential wisdom and soundness of those teachings. He was the one initiate uniquely qualified for his appointed task-the task of successfully present- ing magic as a therapeutic tool to the skeptical world of psychol- ogy, and ultimately, to bring psychotherapy and magic together. In the winter of 1936-37, Regardie was bedridden in London for two weeks with a bad case of bronchitis. During this time he wrote most of what would be published as The Philosopher's Stone, a book about alchemy from a Jungian perspective. At the time Regardie was convinced that laboratory alchemy was fallacious, and that only theoretical, spiritual, or psychological alchemy was valid. (By 1970, however, interaction with practical alchemists such as Frater Albertus of the Paracelsus Research Society caused him to change his opinion on this. He began his own alchemical experiments in a small laboratory setting. Unfortunately, one of his experiments went awry and he seriously burned his lungs when fumes of antimony escaped in the lab. Regardie gave his alchemy equipment to a friend and for the rest of his life he suf- fered from the effects of the accident.)4 Seeing that war in Europe was imminent, Regardie returned to the U.S. in 1937, where he immersed hunself for a number of years in the study of psychology and psychotherapy. He was grateful for his previous experience with the Golden Dawn and a lengthy Freudian analysis-\"for both of wluch I can say in all humility and simplicity-Thank God!\" These were the two influences which led lum to write The Middle Pillar in 1938. The Art of True Healing would soon follow. In 1941 he graduated from the Chiropractic College of New York City with a degree in psychology, and took up practice as a lay analyst. He was particularly intrigued with the work of Wilheim Reich."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"When America became involved in World War 11, Regardie dis- continued hs practice and joined the army, something he later con- sidered a huge mistake. When the war was over, he continued his studies and received a doctorate in psychology. For a time he explored Christian mysticism with as much energy as he had previously pursued Hindu, Jewish, and Buddhist systems. He was especially drawn to Christian Science, New Thought, and the Unity School of Christianity, which taught that faith, belief, and the power of positive thinking could cure physical illnesses. He concluded that the healing techniques taught by these different schools had validity, and he explored these ideas in The Romance of Metaphysics (1946).5 In 1947, Regardie relocated to California and set up practice as a chiropractor and a Reichian therapist. He also taught psychiatry at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic. During this time, he contributed articles to various psychology magazines, including The American Journal of Psychotherapy and Psychiatric Quarterly. Throughout the 1950s Regardie distanced himself from occultists and concentrated on establishing hs practice, which brought hm a comfortable income. He had three marriages which all ended in divorce. He had no cluldren. His interest in magic never waned as can be seen by such books as The Art and Meaning of Magic (1964); Twelve Steps to Spiritual Enlightenment (1969); A Practical Guide to Geomantic Divination (1972); How to Make and Use Talismans (1972); and Foundations of Practical Magic (1979). Regardie retired from his practice in 1981 and moved to Sedona, Arizona, where he continued to write. His later books included Cere- monial Magic (1980); The Lazy Man's Guide to Relaxation (1983); and The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic (1984). He continued to give advice on health and magical matters until the end of his life. We came to know Regardie through Grady McMurtq former Caliph of the OTO. We had established our own independent Golden Dawn temple in Columbus, Georgia, in 1977 and were in the process of building the Vault of the Adepti.6 At that time we were also involved with the OTO, because we were told that the Golden Dawn no longer existed in any form. Grady was well aware that our"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Third Edition xxi primary interest was the Golden Dawn,7 and since he and Regardie were friends, eventually he was kind enough to give us Regardie's address. We were ecstatic-we had assumed that Regardie passed on years ago. We wrote to Regardie and initiated what was to become a rewarding magcal adventure and a close friendship.8 Regardie, as we knew him, was small in stature but great in spirit. In hs later years, the shyness and ihbition of hs youth was gone. In its place was a vitality, a ready smile, a no-holds-barred honesty, and a mischievous Scorpio sense of humor. He enjoyed good food and drink, boxing, professional wrestling, Salvador Dali, and Mozart. He enjoyed the unique red rock outcroppings of Sedona as much as he enjoyed playfully teasing the local New Age inhabitants of that town.9 Although Regardie believed that no magician should be poor or have to struggle to make a living, he was adamantly opposed to the idea of spiritual gurus or magical groups exploiting students for personal financial gain.10 On March 10,1985, Regardie died of a massive heart attack while entertaining friends at a restaurant. We had visited him in his home just ten days prior. His death was a great blow to us. A few days later, we performed the Requiem ceremony from The Golden Dawn in his honor, in conjunction with the reading of one of hs favorite pieces, \"The Prayer of the Sylphs.\"ll Although Regardie is gone, his written works continue to teach and inspire new generations of students. Regardie's classic book, The Middle Pillar, introduces a psycho- logical perspective on magic and occultism and presents an intelli- gent and viable rationale promoting the practice of certain magical techruques, the effects of which can be compared to the processes of analytical psychology. Regardie gave readers clear directions on how to perform the Qabalistic Cross, The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, and the Middle Pillar exercise, along with its accompanying methods of circulating the light, the Vibratory For- mula, and the building up of the Tree of Life in the aura. Regardie, more than any other individual, saw the vast potential of the Middle Pillar exercise, whch was first published in a rather incomplete form in the manuscirpts of the Stella Matutina. Regardie realized that this simple ritual could be adapted into a variety of exer- cises with varying levels of complexity and spiritual development, or"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xxii INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION used for numerous purposes such as charging talismans and healing (healing oneself or healing others). He firmly advocated that the Mid- dle Pillar exercise was an excellent and multifaceted tool that could be easily accessed and employed by any and all for the purpose of self-development and self-healing. Regardie must be credited for the popularity that the Middle Pillar exercise and its numerous variants have enjoyed among ceremonial magicians, mystics, and New Agers for the past several decades. Regardie also brought the disciplines of analytical psychology and magic together as a holistic mechanism for human develop- ment. As an author, Regardie's style of writing was refreshing, inspiring, comprehensible, and non-elitist. Now, nearly sixty years since The Middle Pillar was first published, it remains a fine intro- duction to the psychological processes underlying all magical work. It was with great pleasure, then, that we responded to Llewellyn publisher Carl Weschcke's suggestion that Regardie's classic The Middle Pillar be reprinted and its ideas expanded on so that new generations of seekers could benefit from it. We hope that the material we have contributed to this new annotated edition is a fitting tribute to Regardie's original work, which was so instru- mental in our own spiritual growth. Part One of the thrd edition of The Middle Pillar contains Regardie's masterpiece in its entirety. We have redrawn the illustra- tions and added titles for Regardie's chapters. We have also applied standard rules of capitalization to Regardie's text and changed the style of certain capitalized words to italic. All endnotes are ours. In previous editions, differences in Regardie's spelling of Hebrew words (such as Sephiros in place of Sephiroth, Keser instead of Kether, Tipharas rather than Tiphareth, Daas for Daath, and Malkus in place of Malkuth) are due to a variation in dialect-Askenazic Hebrew versus Sephardic Hebrew. His early works, including The Middle Pillar, fea- tured the Askenazic dialect which was a form of Hebrew pronuncia- tion used in central Europe.12 Later, he adopted the more common Sephardic (Mediterranean) dialect which was used by many Qabalis- tic authors, translators, and most Golden Dawn magicians. The Sephardic pronunciation is used almost exclusively by Western magi- cians today. With this in mind, we have changed the spelling of the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Third Edition xxiii words mentioned above in tlus edition of The Middle Pillar to reflect the modem usage that most readers are familiar with. Part Two contains our own work titled The Balance Between Mind and Magic. This comprises a number of chapters which we have added to supplement and enhance many of the ideas introduced by Regardie in Part One. Chapter Six contains a further exploration of the principles of Jungian psychology and Qabalah. In the Foreword of The Middle Pillar, written in 1938, Regardie expressed a desire to add more information on the art of relaxation and its importance to the individual's well-being. Chapter Seven provides several exer- cises for this, and both solitary and group work is covered. Chapter Eight examines the Eastern system of the chakras including the sim- ilarities and differences between the Qabalistic and Yoga systems of self-growth. An exercise for activating the chakras is included. The use and symbolism of the Pentagram Ritual and the Middle Pillar Exercise are investigated in Chapters Nine and Ten, which also give Egyptian, Greek, Gaelic, and Shamanic versions of these rituals for the benefit of those readers who are not especially drawn to the lan- guage of Hebrew but nevertheless would like to experience the ener- gies involved. Also included is a revised and expanded version of the Middle Pillar by Regardie himself, along with exercises for heal- ing and charging talismans. The Appendix reflects a portion of a larger work called \"The Musical Qabalah\" by Thom Parrott, which builds upon the musical correspondences of Hebrew letters and words used in the Middle Pillar and Pentagram rituals. Also included is a glossary of psychological and magical terms. Regardie's legacy lives on through each and every individual who values and finds meaning in his written works. We strongly suspect that readers of The Middle Pillar will discover that Regardie was an inspirational writer, an etlucal magician, a skilled therapist, a caring healer, a great teacher, a consistent guide, and a compan- ion on the path of the Magic of Light. -Chic Cicero Sandra Tabatha Cicero Metatron House Winter Solstice 1996"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Endnotes 1.

At the time of Chic's Minerval initiation into the OTO in August of 1978, Grady had to walk through the framework of what would later become the walls of the Vault of the Adepti, a purely Golden Dawn creation.

Sedona is a magnet for New Age groups. One time when we had stopped at a local Arby's for a quick lunch, Regardie could not resist engaging a group of peo- ple who were in line behind us. Regardie acted as if he was a complete novice and asked them what they were talking about. \"Oh, it's very cerebral,\" one lady replied, and she continued to explain how they were interested in the mind's psycluc abilities. \"Oh,\" said Regardie, \"you mean the mind has pish-ic abilities!\" (\"Pish-ic\" was Regardie's favorite way of mispronouncing the word \"psychic.\") Regardie continued to play this good-natured game until ow food arrived.

Millions of years may pass in the normal process of evolution before the mass of mankind will reach the state of freedom whch those few individuals who apply them- selves to this work can accomplish in a fraction of the time. And the paradox then dawns upon them that life, instead of being sor- rowful, may just as well be the opposite. \"Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass and are done; but there is that which remains.\"4 And as it has also been written: \"I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothng, and the joy of dissolution a11.\"5 Herein lies the value of magic. Under ordinary conditions, months may be required for the flowering of a plant, but the use of a hot-house will produce identical results within a few weeks. An understanding and application of magic can telescope the time required for man to acquire the realization of hs own divinity. Then, once he has become aware of the existence of hs hgher self, and works in cooperation rather than opposition to it, once he looks to it for guidance and direction, thenceforth regarding his ego as a tool, sharpened and polished to be employed now to fulfill the divine plan rather than in the indulgence of hs own petty purposes-then will his way become easier. Long before obtaining his final release, then may he move fornard on the upward path with joy and equanimity."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Second Edition xxvii So it is that, at a time when the planet seems to be rocking beneath our feet, I derive great pleasure from writing an introduc- tion to a new edition of The Middle Pillar. It is that pillar which stands dependable and relatively changeless as the sphinx, between the extremes of Mercy and Severity, the two outer pillars of the Qabalah's Tree of Life.6 Equally important, it also provides basic principles of magic whch can speed the student on his way to blessed release from the necessity of the accursed wheel. Once he has gained this new understanding, the student, it is to be hoped, will gradually but steadily progress until he has completed the Great Work. In so doing, not only will he help himself by step- ping up his own evolutionary processes, but to that degree will he have raised the frequencies of hs fellow man and even the planet itself, since all that is, is one. Frances G. Wickes in The Inner World of Choice points out that we must \"accept the experience that will bring to birth a latent potential,\" and be willing to dare the leap into the unknown, div- ing deep into the unconscious \"in search of the other unborn or lost potentials of the self.\"7 The Middle Pillar should prove a trustworthy guide on this search. It involves several distinct methods, each of which has been designed for a specific purpose, yet all work together to accomplish the ultimate goal, to erase the barrier between the conscious self and the unconscious, and to enable the student to find within the self, the Great Self who is in reality the only saviour he will ever have. The use of the Qabalistic Cross, as described in an early chap- ter, serves as an ideal means of aiding the ego to undergo an enor- mous expansion, to open up consciousness on a voluntary ordered level to the dictates of the unconscious. The so-called Banishng Ritual of the Pentagrams is a vital techruque designed to eliminate undesirable elements from the psychc sphere, and thus to permit the process of consciousness expansion to proceed without harm or hndrance. The use of the archaic exercise referred to as the Middle Pillar will increase the field of attention, aid in the achievement of balance and equilibrium, and unfold to the aspirant a completely new and remarkable sphere of power and spiritual perception."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"~~viii INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION Every techruque of magic is intended in various ways to widen the field of vision of the conscious ego to the deeper, more spiritual aspects of the divine nature-which, in reality, is his true or higher self. Of the numerous techruques available in the vast armamentar- ium of magic for this purpose, the most vital and essential ones are summed up in the simple exercises outlined in this book. Ceremonial magic enables man to become an engine capable of harnessing and directing the enormous power that lies within. A multitude of basic principles are utilized to ths end. Adoration, which is essential to attaining a sense of unity with godhead, con- centration, development of will and the use of it to accomplish a given purpose, achievement of self-awareness, and the ability to breathe properly, these are but a few of the benefits to be derived from persistent application to the basic practices herein discussed. Various symbolisms are employed in those phases which deal with adoration, but the choice of symbols is actually unimportant. Once it is realized that basically all religions are one and all prophets are true, it is quite logical to borrow any set of symbols from one religion for a certain purpose, and another set from a sec- ond religion for a different purpose. Nor will the practices be of passing value. On the contrary, the set of adorations the student will learn from ths book are to be integrated for all time into the daily pattern of living. Next in importance is the acluevement of a heightened sense of self-awareness. All other exercises and com- plex procedures actually begin from tlus heightening of self-aware- ness. To the degree that the horizon of one's self becomes expanded, to that extent does the self become enlarged. The development of proper breathng habits will serve many purposes, including eradication of considerable neuromuscular tension, with a consequent increase of energy and vitality. The air by which we are surrounded, and in which we live and move and have our being, is the essence of life itself. Consequently we live, literally surrounded by a circumambient sea of energy and vital- ity-a divine force whch can be assimilated by the simple process of learning to breathe in a proper rhythm, altogether apart from more abstruse occult theories."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Intvoduction to the Second Edition xxix Once he has gained control over hs mental processes, the stu- dent can then learn to stimulate and direct his emotions. This becomes will. So complete and interlocking are the details of this system, that the emotions can then be utilized as a tool to be used in directing and holding the mind steady on a given objective. For fervor and conviction are essential to activating the productive and creative agency with man. In the process, over a period of time, life becomes consecrated so that all one's energies become automatically concentrated in a continuous devotion to God or the one life that courses through all of us. In short, the student acheves a perfect and harmonious iden- tification with divine power, life, and love. And then he will know that \"existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass and are done.. . .\"9 The Middle Pillar was originally dedicated to S. L. MacGregor Mathers and Dr. William Wynn Westcott who were chiefs of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, to which I owe so very much. The book is merely the simplest possible representation of some of the elementary practices of that order. In actuality, it is an attempt to simplify and combine the practices both of the Golden Dawn with the insights and later developments of Aleister Crowley.10 The real virtue of the book lies in its correlation of the practice of magic to modern psychotherapy. For magic places the achieve- ment of self-awareness second in importance only to the achieve- ment of unity with God. And Jung's definition of psychotherapy was that whch enabled one to become conscious of what hitherto was unconscious. For untold thousands of years, man has lived in subjugation to the unconscious forces of nature-powerful instincts and drives which led him to act without deliberation or conscious volition, and in complete ignorance in fact of the forces at work which really motivated him. The Great Work recognizes that in these deep unconscious levels lies a great storehouse of power, awareness, and vitality which must not only be awakened but recognized and equilibrated for the human being to function at maximum capacity and efficiency. This in short is the major purpose and function of the teachings of ths book."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"I had first begun to read about psychoanalysis in the writings of Freud and Jung as early as 1926. I cannot say they meant very much to me, save as intellectual stimuli of a fascinating kind. When I first wrote The Middle Pillar, I had just entered psychoanalytical therapy, thanks to the influence of a very dear friend. The tremen- dous value and importance of psychotherapy as a prelude to any serious magical training was just beginning to dawn upon me. My work with Dr. E. A. Clegg of Harley Street, and with Dr. J. L. Bendit,l a Jungian of Wimpole Street in London, led me to realize the importance of psychotherapy to the beginner in mysticism and magic. In fact, thrty-five years later, in 1968, I am more strongly of the opinion than I was then. So fervently do I feel about this that since that time I have acquired some of the qualifications necessary to practice various forms of psychotherapy, particularly that of Wil- helm Reich,l2 whose work I regard as a bridge between conventional psychotherapy and occultism. I doubt if Reich would be pleased to learn of tlus association of mine-but a fact it is nevertheless. Today I will not so much as consider even discussion of the Great Work with a student until he has experienced some form of psychotherapy, I care not which. There is lacking, until then, a com- mon frame of reference, and common medium of communication. In The Middle Pillar will be discovered the first glimmerings of insight I had in that particular direction. It still holds good today. Endnotes 1. The \"wheel of existence\" or the \"wheel of evolution\" refers to the wheel of karma or destiny. Karma is a Sanskrit word that means \"action.\" It is a destiny con- saously chosen in life by each person, created by the total life experiences of all previous incarnations. Karma is the spiritual law of cause and effect-a law of consequence that plays itself out in psychic, moral, and physical ways in the life of human beings. One of the fundamentals of karma is that you get back what you give out. Thus evil that you do in one lifetime will come back to haunt you in the next. Likewise, the good that you do in one lifetime will come back to reward you in the next. In this manner, the individual human soul slowly evolves over the course of many lifetimes, gradually learning though its mistakes and growing a little wiser, a little closer to the divine each time.

There is a general interest in matters dealing with the mind-especially with that aspect of the hinterland of the mind which has been named the unconscious for want of better words and also because its realm at the moment is so ambiguous to us. There could hardly be an educated individual who has not some slight degree of acquaintance with this analytical psychology. Even if this famil- iarity ran only to an acquaintance with several of the more com- monly employed cliches-such as libido, the unconscious, conflicts and resistances, neuroses and complexes-that in itself would be indicative of a phenomenon which surely has occurred seldom before in the history of civilized thought. To meet this widespread interest in matters psychological, a number of books have been written to give the general reader some notion of that peculiar world with which it is the province of the analyst to deal. Quite a number of these are extremely informative, providing a very sane and balanced view of the sub- ject. On the other hand, as is inevitable, there is a large number which might just as well have remained unwritten. One of the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"most curious misconceptions promulgated by some of these latter is the fact that analytical psychology-and here I use this term in its widest sense to cover the various schools inaugurated by Freud, Jung, Adler, etc.-is a thng quite apart, and that the one thing which stamped our ancestors as barbarians and savages was their utter lack of acquaintance with psychotherapy. It would be totally absurd for anyone to minimize all that has been achieved by mod- ern psychology, due to the efforts of such astute investigators as Freud and Jung. But it is abundantly clear that their protagonists- psychological extremists-go entirely too far in disclaiming the intelligence and insight of our predecessors. For the facts are, as but little research indicates, that so far from being ignorant of analytical psychology, the ancients, and particularly those of the East and hther East, had evolved a highly complex and elaborate scheme not only of analysis, but also of spiritual development and synthesis. Some orthodox diehards may question the relationshp of mod- em psychology with discredited oriental and archaic techmques for the unfolding of man's hgher or spiritual nature. In practice, how- ever, such a relationship does indubitably exist. It is a fact of clinical and consulting-room experience. For, during the course of a pro- tracted analysis, the cruder and more superficial unconscious levels having been uncovered and moral conflicts resolved, symbols and theme-motifs of a religious or spiritual nature do make their entry across the threshold of consciousness. This entry is by way of dream, intuition, and by direct apprehension. Not only is this so, but they exert a potent influence on the entire personality producing integrity a new and more equilibrated attitude towards life, and an unification of the various strata of consciousness whch collectively we call man. What modern psychology has quite possibly accomplished is an advance over the efforts of our predecessors in the way of a cathartic technique. Moreover, because of modern devices, the methods of analytical psychology have been brought nearer to the understanding and convenience of the ordinary man of the street. In the past, the techruques of attainment, mysticism, magic, and yoga, or by whatever name such systems were denoted, were always several removes from the ken of the average individual."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Two Pillars of the Temple 5 The psychologies of the past may be summarized by the use of the words yoga and magic. The subject of yoga has already been excellently dealt with by several able and competent writers, requir- ing therefore but little mention here. Such a book as Yoga and Western Psychology by Geraldine Coster must certainly take its place hstori- cally as a genuine and first-rate contribution to the progress of ana- lytical psychology. There is also the compilation of the Buddhst Lodge Concentration and Meditation, a handbook on that subject of great merit.1 A number of modem psychologists have also examined the subject of yoga and meditation as a whole, and have found much that is sympathetic to and explanatory of their own systems. And furthermore, the mystical systems posit a goal and a general schema whch expand the rather hazy and indeterminate character of a very large part of our psycho-therapeutic systems. Analytical psychology and magic comprise in my estimation two halves or aspects of a single techrucal system. Just as the body and mind are not two separate units, but are simply the dual man- ifestations of an interior dynamic \"somethmg,\" so psychology and magic comprise similarly a single system whose goal is the inte- gration of the human personality. Its aim is to unify the different departments and functions of man's being, to bring into operation those which previously for various reasons were latent. Inciden- tally, its techruque is such that neurotic symptoms which were too insistent upon expression either become eliminated or toned down by a process of equilibration. It will be obvious, then, that by magic2 we are not considering a theatrical craft or jugglery-and certainly not that mediaeval superstition whch was the chld of ignorance begotten by fear and terror. These definitions should be expunged from our thinking. For centuries magic has been quite erroneously associated with such pathologies as witchcraft3 and demonolatry4 due to the duplicity of charlatans and the reticence of its own so-called authorities. Even today, the custodians of this knowledge, harassed by personal problems and more especially by their own power complex are still adamant in their traditional refusal to circulate a more accurate description of the nature of magic. Possibly even they have lost all understanding of its principles. No wonder is it"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"that misconception exists. With the exception of very few works which have attracted the attention of but a fractional part of the reading public, little has been written to act as a definitive exposi- tion of what magic really is. Inasmuch as something of the nature of modern psychology is at least partially understood by a fair sec- tion of the educated world, were it said that magic is akin to and concerns itself with that same subjective realm of psychology, some notion of its character and objectives come within hailing distance. So far as the average man or aspirant to magic is concerned, unquestionably the analytic technique should comprise the first stage of the routine employed in spiritual development. For until one understands himself according to that peculiarly penetrating light which psychology has thrown upon our motives, he cannot hope to bring effectively into operation the dormant side of his nature. And lest anyone casually dismiss this desirable self- knowledge as a goal easily attained to or, it may be, already obtained, one can only utter a solemn warning that this is not so simple as at first sight seems. That self-knowledge is necessary to the pursuit of magic is self-evident. At once we are faced at the portal by guardians armed to the teeth. Such queries confront us as: suppose the interest in spiritual culture were motivated by a desire to escape from the turbulence of physical life? What if one's stubbornly defended point of view were only an elaborate rationalization to conceal the sense of insecurity, the dull but insistent ache of inferiority? These are quite often the unrecog- nized factors which compel refuge in the religious avocation- even in various branches of science too. The search for, and quite often assumed discovery of some paternal-like God or a testy senior after the fashion of Jehovah, frequently has its origins in an adolescent rejection of the father. This, deliberately forgotten, has become so deep, that the inner psychic necessity for the authority and affection of the father is unconsciously projected outwards into a terrifying and awe-inspiring deity. Discernment of the true motives of conduct and attitude towards life is, therefore, an absolute essential. This accomplished, then may be examined that other side of the medallion which is man's own psyche."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Two Pillars of the Temple 7 As a practical system, magic is concerned not so much with analysis as with bringing into operation the creative and intuitive parts of man. A psychological techruque can never be a wholly inte- grative one until it accepts ths spiritual side of man and assists the analysand in the recognition of or acquaintance with its activity. At ths moment, the treatment of these matters remains almost entirely within the domain of magic alone. Fully does it recognize the neces- sity for integration. Not only does it accept and recommend the results of analysis, but it proceeds still further. If analysis aims at the acceptance of the unconscious, and the validity of its co-existence with consciousness, then magic may be said to be a technique for realizing the deeper levels of the unconscious. These are levels of power and realization whose value we can but dimly grasp through contemplation of religious figures of the past. Buddha, Jesus, Krishna, St. Francis, and a host of others are instances of such illuminated men--of individuals who have striven, all in different ways, to know themselves and attain to a realization of their true divine nature. If so we wish, the techruques they employed we may call devotion, medi- tation, and contemplation. Fundamentally however, they are identi- cal in spirit with what we now propose to discuss as magic. In the latter, however, the entire process of attainment has been system- atized and developed almost into an exact science, having as its foun- dation the discovery of godhead. We there may be very few in life who can attain to the full realization of their divine origin and nature, yet for all of us there is some value to magic, some degree of fulfill- ment or attainment available. There is none so small as cannot employ it to some good and noble end. None so great as cannot bet- ter himself morally and otherwise, thus rendering hmself more effi- cient to cope with and understand life and the world both about and within him. These are objectives whch, notwithstanding the magni- tudes of their vision, are wih the reach of every man. It is not yet the moment to enter into a disquisition on the intricacies of magical ritual. But in order to expound fundamental psychological and spiritual principles it is necessary to refer to what are known"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"technically as the two pillars.5 Half-way between the east and west, and north and south, in a properly instituted temple are placed two upright pillars.6 One of these is colored white, the other black. These pieces of lodge furniture are emblematical of the two opposites func- tioning in the diverse operations of nature. Just as the temple repre- sents in miniature the whole of life by which we may ever be confronted, or, rather, the manifold parts of our own inner nature, so these two pillars symbolize some aspect of these phenomena. They represent light and darkness, heat and cold. In man, they stand for love and hate, joy and pain, mind and emotion, life and death, sleep ing and waking. Every pair of opposites conceivable to the human mind find their representation in the implication of these two pillars. Now one of the most important ideas communicated to the stu- dent of magic, in his ceremonial initiation when he is led from one station to another, is that an extreme leaning either to one or the other of the opposites is a very dangerous thg. It is unwise to swing to opposite poles of life's pendulum. \"Unbalanced power is the ebbing away of life. Unbalanced mercy is but weakness and the fading out of the will. Unbalanced severity is cruelty and the barrenness of mind.\"' Were we to change the terminology of the speech, instead of the word \"mercy\" we might substitute \"emotion,\" or \"generosity,\" or \"love\"; for \"severity\" we may substitute \"power,\" \"the rational side of us,\" or \"justice,\" or \"tyranny.\" Either of these qualities when carried to an extreme, unmodified by the other, is conducive to an unhealthy state of psyche. Thus it is, that in so religiously authoritative a book as the Bhagavad-Gita,B which some consider one of the finest pieces of devotional and philosophical literature yet penned, we find it stated \"Be free from the pairs of opposites.\" The whole of life-it is in fact the law of nature itself-seems to be dominated by these extremes or opposites. \"Two contending forces and one which unites them eternally. Two basal angles of the triangle and one which forms the apex. Such is the origin of creation; it is the Triad of Life.\"g Only a little reflection will con- vince the reader of the truth of this theorem.

Age, it is true, does bring moderation and temperance with it. But were ths more balanced attitude towards life cultivated, taught or adopted earlier or before middle age set in, how much more efficient could we not be, and what could we not acheve? The techque under consideration consists primarily in the conscious reconciliation of opposing forces. It is this which has been called the development of the Golden Flower.10 Before proceeding further, it is a very interesting piece of specu- lation to consider the trinities of various religions. Most of them resolve themselves when all theological argument and intellectual quibbling are eliminated, into some such relationship as Father, Mother, and Son. Osiris, Isis, and Horus are an excellent example. This is true also of the Christian system where, upon careful con- sideration we find the Holy Ghost defined as a feminine aspect of godhead.11 And in the Hebrew Qabalah we have the Trinity on the Tree of Life of Chesed (\"Mercy\"), Gevurahl2 (\"Might\") and Tiphareth (\"Equilibrium\" or \"Beauty\"). Co-relating this latter triad with tradi- tional symbolism, Chesed is masculine, referred to Jupiter, a paternal wisdom symbol. Gevurah, feminine, is attributed to Mars, indicative of great power. One alchemical aphorism expresses this duality in the words \"Man is peace and woman is power.\" Bearing all these in mind, we conclude that as Chesed represents the Father and Gevurah the Mother,l3 so Tiphareth which is Beauty, is the reconciler between them. Interestingly enough, Tiphareth is referred to the Sun, and corresponds to the thrd member of the theological trinity, the Son. Looking at these trinities as so many expressions of psychologi- cal fact-that is, as previously defined, as factors active with the psyche itself-we are struck by the similarity of the religious point of view with the idea of the Middle Way.14 It is the pursuit of ths mid- dle path which leads to self-conquest and the steady growth of the Golden Flower, the wakening of the imprisoned soul within. The Father and Mother may be said to correspond to the two pillars of the temple, to the two extremes or opposites. In this sense they are the tendencies exhibited by all the phenomena of nature. They are the extremes of spirit and matter, love and hate, life and death, ebb and flow, systole and diastole. Nature itself is the embodiment of the two extremes, the two opposites of the Trinity."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Man, unenlightened man, one in whom neither wisdom nor under- standing has been brought to birth, likewise fashons his life in the way of these two extremes. Or rather, these extremes fashion his life for hm. For he is, as though by compulsion, driven by some external force he knows not of, between the poles of extreme love and hate, swinging from kindness and maudlin generosity to bursts of uncontrolled anger, hate and meanness. His actions, almost without a single exception, are so many semi-hysterical flights from pole to pole of his emotions. He is, as it were, under the dominion of the Father and the Mother. To the student of the psyche, to the one who seeks wisdom and the knowledge of his higher self, the counsel has always been given to avoid the opposites. His task is to refrain from the com- pulsion of extreme actions. In certain schools of magic, where the rites of initiation were cel- ebrated by adepts who at one time thoroughly understood the tech- nique they employed, initiation ceremonies depicted the burial of the higher self and its rebirth by means of a techrucal system of magic and meditation. Therein, the higher self was always represented by some sacred figure of the major religions-a man who was nearly always shown as the Son of Cod. The essence of the ethcal injunc- tions of these systems was to develop the Son with. \"Unless Chst be born in you.. . .\" \"Look with; thou are Buddha.\" I do not believe these images could possibly have reference to any hstorical individ- ual we know of. But rather I surmise these refer to the gradual bring- ing into conscious operation of a spiritual point of view, of an equilibrated attitude towards life, an attitude not exclusively directed to any extreme. Recognizing the polarity of life, such a point of view sought to steer a middle way between the tortuous and extreme activity of nature. It is the way of the Reconciler, of keeping to the ' path between the two pillars, that balanced and harmonious position in which the candidates of the ancient initiation systems found them- selves at the major crisis and climax of their initiation. Ths is the tech- nique of bringing to birth the golden Sun of Tiphareth, the Sun of beauty and harmony who is the thd person of the Trinity.

For the Father and Mother are \"those forces whose reconciliation is the key of life.\"l6 To illustrate in another way the import of ths concept, let us describe it from a practical and physical point of view. One of the major inconveniences which afflicts a large portion of mankind is constipation. In many instances of this disorder, no organic distur- bance exists at .all; the trouble being principally a functional one. (Though it must be here interpolated that even if it were organic, there is sufficient psychological evidence to indicate that this like- wise may ensue from an identical series of causes.) Very often, this malady does not respond to any kind of medical treatment. It is not uncommon for patients to testify that they have been recom- mended massage, surgical operations, drugs, nature cure, and all the other types of cures. In spite of these the illness persists unchanged. Enquiry elicits that there is, frequently a conscious conflict between two courses of conduct. More often than not, how- ever, the real seat of the conflict is not in consciousness at all, but exists in a far deeper level of mind, in the unconscious. It was prob- ably around puberty that an already existent conflict developed such acuteness and severity as to require for the psychic safety of the ego to be repressed completely out of sight. From this, we might conclude-and there is some psychologi- cal evidence to ths end-that the conflict is one between the instincts and social dictates. That is, because of parental training there is a blind refusal to recognize the necessity for the proper and legitimate expression of the instincts. It is a denial of one side of the personality, a denial without justification or reason. It is as though, while admiring the beauty and form of the lotus, we wished not to be reminded of the slimy source where grow the roots of the plant, and therefore cut the stalk right through, severing the flower from its necessary root. This cutting of the lotus stalk has its counterpart in human minds, many of us having been cut off from our roots.

It is to recognize quite clearly that the physical symptoms are the results of an internal conflict, a conflict between the needs of the body and the self-sufficiency or cowardice of the mind. It is a con- flict between the necessity to the expression of emotion and feeling, and the imperious urge of the ego to escape from a vulnerable con- stituent of its nature, that principle which at one time had been sus- ceptible to hurt and injury. With the frank recognition of the conflict, one should endeavor to recollect the events of his early chldhood, bringing up as many memories as possible of that period, experi- encing neither shame nor remorse at his discoveries.18 Confronting these memories with the knowledge that as an adult in whom is the light of reason, he understands that his mature mind can dissipate the infantile emotion connected with early experiences, in which shame or inferiority or insecurity was felt. In this way he links and applies mind to emotion, thus avoiding with him the uncon- trolled play of the opposites. Their existence is neither denied nor frustrated. This is a vital point to be understood. No denial or rejec- tion should be countenanced of what manifestly is an actual fact, no stubborn refusal to admit and accept a part of his own nature. As we have seen, the denial of any function of the self leads to dissoci- ation, and the latter results in nervous and physical disorders. Face the fact that at one time there was a denial of one phase of life, and thus accept the conflict. Accept it, knowing that so long as we remain human, these conflicts are bound to be our lot. In our present stage of evolution, they are part and parcel of human nature, and so cannot be avoided. But what can be eliminated is the ignorant attitude so often adopted towards them. For these oppo- sites, the two pillars of the temple, their magical images or proto- types, represent \"those eternal forces betwixt which the equilibrium of the universe dependeth. Those forces whose reconciliation is the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Two Pillars of the Temple 13 Key of Life, whose separation is evil and death.\"'gThis, then, is the solution to conflict. They must be reconciled. Let me recapitulate. There must be the clear recognition of the conflict. Its exact nature must be analyzed and faced, and its pres- ence accepted in all its implications. One must endeavor to bring up into consciousness, so far as the capabilities of the mind permit, all the memories of childhood. In a word, he should attempt to perform a species of what is called in the Buddhist system the Sammasati meditation. This consists in a cultivation and rigid examination of memory. The idea involved here is not that these recollections in themselves are worth any- thg, but that raising them up to the surface releases a great deal of tension associated with early experiences. There is often a tying up of nervous energy in childhood experiences, in trivial events which are allowed to be forgotten and to sink into unconsciousness. But ths forgetfulness does not overcome the shock of nervous exhaus- tion connected with them. On the contrary, they set up what are called resistances-resistances to the flow of life and vitality from the primitive and vital layers of the unconscious level. \"What matters,\" remarks Georg Groddeck20 the brilliant Ger- man physician-psychologist, \"is not to make conscious anything at all of the unconscious, but to relieve what is imprisoned, and in so doing it is by no means rare for the repressed material to sink into the depths instead of coming into consciousness.. .. What is decisive in the success of treatment is the removal of resistance.\" Beginning with the actual events of the day upon which the reader determines to commence ths exercise, the meditation should gradually extend its field of vision until ultimately the events and occurrences of the earliest years are brought into the light of day. The techruque is principally one of the training of the mind to think backwards. Difficult though at first it may seem, practice leads the student slowly and gradually to facility in the art of remembering. The facts of memory confronted fearlessly, with- out shame and discomforture, the resistance to the flow of vitality between the various levels of consciousness is broken down, restoring physical, nervous, and spiritual health."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"As the childhood memories are exposed, the student will see for himself in what way the conflict now bothering him came into manifestation. Since by definition a neurosis21 is a maladaptation of the psyche to life itself, by this process of remembering he will see in what way he failed to respond properly to the phenomena of his existence. Realizing this, and recognizing thoroughly the nature of his conflict, he must now endeavor to ignore it. More accurately a more positive attitude should be adopted. He must develop in an entirely new direction. It must be remembered, however, and this is important, that to ignore any symptom of conflict as man- ifested in mind or body, is dangerous until the conflict in ques- tion has been recognized and accepted. The unconditional acceptance almost invariably acts as its resolution. Any other attitude constitutes an escape. The escape mechanism is that so frequently adopted by the neurotic and must be avoided. It is the way of the coward. To face the conflict is to rob it and its consequences of crippling fear. Hon- esty with oneself acts as a catharsis. One finds hmself endued with a new courage and greater ability to face one's problem in an entirely new and more practicable way. Given the recognition of the conflict causing constipation, the symptom itself may be severely ignored, relying upon the bowel after the lapse of some days to recommence functioning of its own accord. The conflict and the warring between the two sides of the psyche, tied a knot as it were in consciousness preventing the perfect functioning of the whole. The immediate result of this is an impediment in the free movement of nervous energy in the body-mind system, causing stasis in that part of the system having a relationship or correspon- dence with the factors concerned in the conflict. Ocdt theory as we have it from tradition may be extremely use- ful here. With some degree of practical experience, we could easily discover the precise nature of the original conflict by a consideration of that part of the organism to the symptoms of whch our attention is attracted. For example, consider one troubled by nephntis.22 One of the most si&cant aspects of the magical tradition is astrology. In this latter science the kidneys are referred to the operation of the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Two Pillars of the Temple 15 planet Venus. As we know from mythology, Venus is the deity con- cerned with love, feeling, and emotion. We would surmise therefore that in the event that the love or emotional life of an individual has been frustrated or repressed to such a point where the psyche finally refused to continue living wlrulst hampered by such a neurosis, some expression of that frustration could be transferred to the neighbor- hood of the kidneys. Were the frustration complete and devastating to the psyche, it is not impossible that we should find a cancer-the symptom par excellence of the death-wish, the so-called suicide complex indicative of a division in the psyche's integrity. Moreover, we could proceed a step further. We might enquire as to whether the affliction were on the right or left, remembering the Qabalistic definition of the Left Pillar as the side of Mercy, and that on the Right as the Pillar of Severity.23 \"Unbalanced mercy is weakness and the fading out of the will. Unbalanced severity is cruelty and the barrenness of mind.\"24 Enquiry might elicit the fact that an afflicted left kidney was symptomatic of one who had been afraid to taste life to the full. Or on the other hand, out of sheer compensation, had lived, so com- pletely as to have over-indulged. The right kidney would indicate symptoms of severe and violent repression on principle-where the entire emotional life had been so subjected to continuous frustration because of an ethical standard that the outraged eros reacted upon the body either with acute nephritis or it may be with cancer. Where there is trouble with the legs, the patient being unable to stand and confined to the bed, some psychological thmkers proffer some such explanation as this. The legs are the things we stand on, that whch gives support to the body. In the symbolic pageantry uti- lized by the unconscious-and it must be understood that the activ- ity of the unconscious proceeds almost exclusively through what are to us symbols-the instinctual life is our mental support. It is that which we tend to rely upon, our stability and foundation, during life. Should therefore our understanding of life fall short of what it should be for us-and obviously that standard varies with different people-so that we unduly repress our instincts to the point when the resulting sense of insecurity and anxiety become intolerable, the psyche achieves a revenge through an affliction of the supports of"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"the personality. Thus it is that we learn, so it is said, by illness. When our supports, no matter of what nature, have been ahlated, we sometimes seek to enquire into causes and origins. When the enquiry is honestly furthered, with a sincere view to self-knowledge, and internal resistance broken down by meditation or analysis, no doubt recovery would ensue. That is to say the disappearance of the alarming symptoms, and a return of normal function. The solvent to these difficulties, the practical solution of the problem, consists primarily in the elimination so far as possible of fear. Of course, from the larger point of view, fear is an essential part of our make-up. Man is so puny a creature on the face of the earth, and nature is vast and terrible in her operations. How else could it be that fear eats at the heart of each of us? But this is a wholesome fear-a fear which is the beginning of wisdom. The emotion under consideration is a pathological thing-fear of the future, fear of position, a needless worrying about affairs which cannot be helped or changed, at least not by hugging a constant fear that they will change in a manner that is painful and sad. From the spiritual point of view, fears such as we have named act as a great freezer, as an inhibitor of action and of the free flow of vital energy from with. The man who is afraid to embark upon a given course of action because it may lead to failure, or whose apprehen- sion of success and of the future generally, is hardly likely to accomplish very much. \"Fear is failure\" says one magical apho- rism, \"and the forerunner of failure. Be thou therefore without fear, for in the heart of the coward, virtue abideth not.\"25 One of the most interesting instances of the psycho-therapeutic attitude to fear and anxiety and the escape-problem as a whole was Groddeck's treatment, when he was a physician before applying psy- chology to his problems, of certain cases of indigestion and nervous dyspepsia. One of the psychological theorems regarding hs form of discomfort is that it is due to anxiety. We all know how bad news or worry affects the digestion, from turning the food sour to taking away the appetite. But the root cause of this particular anxiety is not the problem in hand, but the anxiety which has its roots in an early conflict and is made the worse by the occurrence of an immediate problem evoking conflict and anxiety. Groddeck's treatment-almost"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Two Pillars of the Temple 17 the homeopathc principle-emphasized or comprised a diet of pre- cisely those foods which formerly disagreed with his patient. If eggs were the cause of indigestion the diet would comprise eggs until eventually the psyhc would give up attempting to evade the asso- ciations which had been linked to eggs, and the digestive trouble would in time disappear. To force the psyche to face its problems and accept them was hs idea rather than that the psyche should continu- ally baulk from and attempt to flee the symptoms it threw up in the body. The unconditional acceptance of the conflict, and the associa- tions connected with it, was the first step towards me. The tehque is, in a word or two, an attack on the escape mechanism. Integrity cannot be won by an escapist attitude towards life. The reward of the attitude which escapes from problems and the reality of life is more likely than not to be notlung but the gnawing pain of guilt and sin. The same method is often made use of in other forms of ther- apy. Amongst these, for example, is the treatment of nightmares by analysis. The terror experienced in nightmare, causing the dreamer to awaken bathed in perspiration, angered by a palpitation of the heart, and experiencing an inexplicable sense of impending cata- strophe, is likewise due to some conflict or other. Its nature, being unconscious, can only be determined by the context of the dream, and by the lengthy process of confession, free association, and reductive analysis. But if the dreamer can be trained in his waking state to realize that the nightmare is only the expression of an internal conflict, then he has proceeded halfway to the point where it will cease to bother him. He must accept the presence of such a disorder rather than attempt to escape it, because escape is not an adequate solution of a psychc problem. This discovery was brought home to us during the war. Amongst the soldiers at the front were those who would not recognize the very obvious fact, that war was a dangerous matter and that they were afraid. Trus they would not accept, though underneath a veritable torrent of fear was raging, and the whole of the instinctive impulse was to bolt from the scene of battle. Those who recognized this impulse but at the same time saw that flight was impossible and that the war had to be seen through, came to no mental or spiritual harm."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"It was the former type, suffering from a terrible fear but boasting that they were not in the least afraid, who became affected by shell- shock. Shell-shock-the shock experienced by the nervous system through the devastating noise of explosion, had nothing to do with their actual trouble at all. The cause was simply a cowardly refusal to face the conflict raging in the psyche. And when ths became so intolerable, an actual split occurred in consciousness, so that there was a gap in memory, awareness, and in efficiency. With the acceptance of the theory of conflict as a cause of night- mare, a subtle change gradually creeps into the nightmare-dream. The following is one rather fine example, together with the method of dealing with it. A woman patient frequently dreamed that she was hanging from a rope in a room which had an enormously high ceiling, about fifty or sixty feet high. The rope was affixed by a hook to the ceiling, and the weight imposed upon the hook was gradually loosening the plaster around. Any moment, the hook would tear loose from the ceiling, and the body would be dashed to the ground. At this juncture of the dream, unable to face the terror of being hurled to death on the ground, the woman awoke in a frenzy of fear, screaming. The advice given in this particular case-and since the dream is a typical nightmare, the same techmque may be widely recommended-was to suggest to the woman the advis- ability of meditating on the dream before falling to sleep at night. The suggestion was to lengthen the term of the dream so as to invite the nightmare and observe what happened when the plaster did finally break, tearing the hook from the ceiling. Constant and deep reflection on the dream's theme before sleep was the method by whch the unconscious could so be influenced as to induce a vigilant attitude even during the progress of the fan- tasy. The topic of meditation would also be the conscious applica- tion of the idea of non-resistance. Let the catastrophe occur, and see what happens. If the fantasy is being perched on a high cliff and at any moment there is the danger of being hurled to the ground, awaking at mid-point in a sweat of fear, then gradually train the mind to thrust out all resistance to the fall. By methods such as"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Two Pillars offhe Temple 19 these resistance and repression is broken down and fear eliminated from the sphere of consciousness. Here, some word should be said about repression26 and the means of its elimination. A great many people have come to believe, through a very casual reading of some of the early psycho- analytic literature, that psychology countenances the removal of repression by means which are unethical and antisocial. Nothing could be further from the truth. Repression is always defined as an unconscious and automatic process. It is a process by which the personality protects itself against distasteful concepts, by thrusting them without the horizon of consciousness into the dark and for- bidding region of the unconscious. Since this process begins very early in life, the unconscious is by middle age stuffed with a mass of repressed material ideas about parents and relatives, associa- tions connected with environment, infantile beliefs and actions. Suppression, on the other hand, is a deliberate and conscious thing. It presupposses a process of conscious selection and elimination, in whch one alternative is suppressed in favor of another. It is repression, the unconscious process of thrusting things out of sight, which is the dangerous method. It is dangerous because repressed emotions and feelings lock up memory and power in the unconscious. Because ideas become associated with each other, forming definite complexes, there is, if repressed memories begin to grow by association, a splitting off of one side of the mind at the expense of the other with a consequent locking up of energy and vitality which should be available for the entire personality. The conquest of repression proceeds as with the conquest of internal conflict previously described. There is no need to live an anti-social or vicious life, one of self- indulgence or of degradation as so many people think. To be free from a repression does not argue that one should have behaved like \"a young man about town.\" Though that is not to say that a reasonable satisfaction of the instinctual life should be eschewed where this is at all possible. But the frank realization and accep- tance of the human personality as many-sided, and a refusal to blind oneself to experience no matter of what kind, will go far"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"towards relieving the partition erected between the unconscious and the conscious, and removing resistance and repression. To restate the attitude expounded in this chapter, I conceive of analytical psychology as the spouse of the ancient system of magic. For psychology has succeeded in evolving a system which can be applied to almost any individual who wishes to know the several departments and constituents of his own personality. Possibly for the first time in the history of civilized thought, there is a technique which is of inestimable value to the average man. It is of supreme value to the studen.t of magic and mysticism, who, too often, labors under several delusions of what it is that he hopes to accomplish, and in what length of time he will do so. A study of analysis will prove first of all that he cannot proceed quicker than his own unconscious permits him. This will prevent gate-crashing, and an irrational enthusiasm and desire for speed. Secondly, through the elimination of erroneous ideas as to himself, the phantasms of wish-fulfillment and insensate day-dreaming, he will have obtained a more comprehensive account of what magical and med- itation systems can accomplish, and what degree of achievement in these spheres is open to him. He will be entirely less subject to delusion and deception because his attraction to magic will not have been caused by the unconscious desire to escape from the pressing problems of his immediate existence with which he finds himself unable efficiently to cope. Moreover, he will have familiarized himself with the true extent of his own sense of inferiority. The compulsive necessity of becoming unduly aggressive because of an imagined or pathologi- cal inferiority will no longer urge him to an intolerable sense of deficiency. Being acquainted with the fundamental problem of insecurity which every thinking individual is bound to have, since man is so apparently insignificant and unimportant when com- pared to the vastness of the universe, he will not be liable to adopt extreme religious or scientific notions from so-called spiritual expe- rience or laboratory experiment to buttress up his own desire for some one thing which is secure and reliable. Analysis is the logical precursor of spiritual attainment and magical experiment. It should comprise definitely the first stage of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Two Pillars of the Temple 21 spiritual training. Were it possible, and were there magical schools in existence, it would gratify me enormously to see magical train- ing preceded by six or twelve months of application to reductive analysis, pursued by sympathetic physicians or lay-analysts who had long and intimate experience with clinical work. The magical schools must open a department of analytical psychology, if their own systems are to attain public prominence worthy of attention and patronage. Such schools, though offering courses of training considerably prolonged, would eventually develop such a type of individual that the public would eliminate \"dangerous\" from its association with magic, and be obliged to take cognizance of the soundness of its technique. This union of two systems would, for magic at any rate, build up psychological credit, and a sense of great reliability and prestige would accrue to it. One of the greatest obstacles to success in magic, to any kind of worth-while result in the mystical sciences, is that the psycho-emo- tional system of its average student is hopelessly clogged with infantile and adolescent predilections which have not been recog- nized as such. The ego is compelled to extreme courses of action, as though by compulsion. And underneath his every activity lurks the unconscious spectre--fear. It is precisely with these monsters of fantasy that analyfxal psychology can deal effectively, and it is from such absurd obstacles that the magical students is a con- firmed but unconscious sufferer.27 By associating magic with analysis, we should be able to avoid the pitfalls into which our predecessors fell so headlong. The pro- duction of genius--more specifically a religious and mystical type of genius4ver the goal of magc, should be more within our grasp than ever before, and considerably more open to achievement. These ideas are mentioned not because a systematic union of magic and psychology will be here presented, but in the hope that this effort will spur some psychologist acquainted with magical and mystical techmques to attempt such a task. Whoever does suc- ceed in welding the two indissolubly together, to him mankind will ever be grateful. For such a union comprises the marriage of the archaic with the modem, the unconscious with the conscious-the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"precursor of the birth of the Golden Flower not for any individual alone but for mankind as a whole. 1.

Aleister Crowley adopted the medieval spelling of magick with a \"k\" to dif- ferentiate the psycho-spiritual science from stage magic. The magicians of the Golden Dawn, as well as countless theurgists before them, spelled magic without the \"k.\" Like Regardie, we see no reason to surrender the word \"magic\" to the arena of the stage magician. 3. Keep in mind that this book was first printed in 1938, over a decade before Gerald Gardner published Witchcraft Today and started the religion of Wicca, which is positive and life-affirming. Regardie's reference to \"such pathologies as witchcraff'refers to the medieval superstitions, hexes, and general hysteria that resulted in the Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials. 4. Unfortunately in modem times the \"pathology of demonolatry\" has a follow- ing among certain individuals who call themselves Satanists. Although many self-proclaimed Satanists are merely practicing a rather juvenile philosophy created out of adolescent rebellion based on the rejection of the religious beliefs of their parents, others are simply unethical, dysfunctional sociopaths who have little or no regard for others. Satanists of the latter sort can safely be defined as individuals who worship Satan (the Christian entity of evil), invoke evil spirits, and practice harmful (black) magic towards others. Thus, Satanism is not a life-affirming philosophy, and it should be soundly rejected by any true seeker who wishes to evolve spiritually. For as Regardie stated in The Tree of Life, 241-242: \"Those who employ such methods [of black magic] should be severely shunned by the Theurgist as he would a foul disease.\" In the Neophyte Ritual of the Golden Dawn, the candidate swears \"...I will not debase my mystical knowledge in the labour of Evil Magic at anytime tried or under any temptationJ'(Regardie, The Golden Dawn, 123). It should be clear that serious, ethical magicians do not engage in Satanism or black magic. 5.

And it will be con- ceded by all that the problems relating to fear, anxiety insecu- rity and inferiority, in connection with the broad divisions of the conscious and the unconscious, are fundamental to both systems. Therefore, before being able to consider any of the techniques of the methods employed by magic, it is essential that we analyze a little further this classification of the psyche into the conscious and the unconscious. While a simple outlook has certainly its advantages, yet difficulties arise demanding a further subdivision and calling for the consideration of additional factors operative within the unconscious. It is really not so simple as seems at first sight. Magic employs a somewhat more extensive view of the two primary aspects of the psyche. And it is necessary to consider at greater length the intricate nature of man, so that we may realize more or less exactly what it is that in magical experiments we are desirous of aclueving. It seems to me that the division of the psyche into conscious and unconscious is entirely too simple to prove adequate as a means of explanation. The almost over-used instance of the ice- berg-with one-seventh of its mass above the surface and six-sev- enths below-is all right as far as it goes. But does it go far enough?"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"If that division is to avail us at all in practice, that portion of the psyche which is below the surface of our normal awareness demands more insight into its nature and rather deeper analysis. There is, therefore, some wide realization of the inadequacy of, this division, varying with the different schools and systems of prac- tice. Thus in the Freudian school we meet with the primary con- cepts of the libido, which is defined with particular emphasis on the sexual urge. There is also the slightly broader classification of psychic activity into a triad of the id, the super-ego, and the ego. In the system propounded by Dr. C. G. Jung, we meet as before with the libido, though here it is defined not as sexuality but in far more philosophical terms as the sum total of psychic energy and vitality, and its expression is through instinct, desire, and function. The faculties of the mind also are described in a four-fold pattern, operating in a positive and negative way. There are the feeling, thinking, sensation, and intuitional functions of the psyche, each capable of a passive or an active response, depending upon whether the psyche be introverted or extroverted. The unconscious itself is also conceived to have a dual aspect. That part of it which is personal and individual, and that great stream of power, arche- type and image of which the former is only a part-the collective unconscious. It is a universal and uniform substratum common to the whole of mankind. We may consider it to be the historical back- ground from which every psyche and every consciousness has pro- ceeded or evolved. It is the prirnordi~aSi~Uponw~&ea~ace and people and civilization evolves its own individual pattern. It is this that the mediaeval alchemists called Anima Mundi.1 While having innumerable points of contact with the above psy- chologies, the magical conception differs in several respects. For one thing, it prefers to use a diagram to express its viewpoint, believing that reflection upon this glyph, which for centuries has been an object of meditation, will yield illuminating ideas associated in the unconscious with its parts. Secondly, it believes that man is a more complex being than the newer schools would allow. The diagram it employs is a Qabalistic glyph called the Tree of Life. This shows the ten spheres or Sqhirofh as they are called arranged in a geometrical pattern to form three columns or pillars. That to the left shows"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life 27 three spheres one above the other, and is called the Left Pillar or the Pillar of Mercy.2 The Right Pillar or that of Severity also shows three spheres, while the central pillar is indicated by four spheres one above the other, the Pillar of Beneficence.3 To each one of these spheres is ascribed a different characteristic of the self. That is, the diagram expresses the integral nature of man according to ten quite distinct functions. It is the unity of these ten factors which together comprise what we choose to call man. The id, to use the Freudian term, is the most central core of man, the deepest level of his unconscious, being represented on the Tree by the upper-most sphere of the middle pillar. Reference to the chart (Figure 2, p. 28) will elucidate the problem enormously, clari- fying my explanations. At the outset, a word or two must be added about the employment of foreign words and an unfamiliar termi- nology. It is, in my opinion, a regrettable fact that objections should be raised to unfamiliar and strange words. When some new lan- guage is to be learned, the alphabet is at first difficult to acquire. This happens in magic, for in most instances there are no terms existent in English to express the idea to be conveyed, and where such a term does exist it does not have the appropriate psycholog- ical or spiritual background to indicate what is required of it. It is my object, nevertheless, to co-relate such terms where they do exist with those of the Qabalistic system, to indicate that it has long rec- ognized these concepts now being dealt with by psychology. Not only so, but it has evolved a profound technique whereby such potencies may be brought into manifest operation. The magical correspondence of the psychological id, or es as Dr. Georg Groddeck called it, is the Yechidah-a word meaning the monad, the self, the paternal ens4 of Light. It is the \"essence of mind which is intrinsically pure,\" to adopt a definition of an Eastern reli- gious text.5 It is also the Buddha-nature, the realization of which is that alone which differentiates the enlightened man, the sage, from him who is ignorant and unenlightened. Just as in physics, where the electron may be considered either as an electrical particle or as a system of radiations or waves, so this Yechidah may be considered from two quite distinct points of view. It is the innermost kernel of the self, the deepest core of consciousness itself, unconsciousness to"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Pillar of Beneficence (Balance) Figure 2: The Tree of Life."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life 29 our ordinary awareness-while on the other hand it is the life-flow itself, the current of libido, which is the sum-total of our vitality and our life. Since the translation of Eastern texts has been made available, many psychologists have pounced on several Chinese terms for inclusion within the technical nomenclature of their own systems. One such term selected by Jung to have reference to a concept such as explained above in connection with the Yechidah, is Tao.6 This - term, so ambiguous to the Western mind accustomed to precision and accurate definition, has been variously translated as God, or a goal, or heaven. The sinologue Wilhelm prefers the word \"mean- ing\" and Jung employed it as having a closer association with the conception which he wished to explain, for it is precisely this factor in consciousness which, eventually, provides a meaning for life and for man. And in the diagram which is provided in The Secret of the Golden Flower to which Jung wrote an erudite and profound Euro- pean commentary7 the placing of the psychic factor Tao is similar to the position of Yechidah upon the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Though I wish to avoid metaphysics so far as is possible, cer- tain theories demand expression. In order to retain accuracy with simplicity, it must be stated that the Qabalistic tradition posits a universal stream of life, described in terms of light, behind as it were the monad. That is to say, the Yechidah, so far from being an ultimate division in itself, is but one particular point or section of the universal life or the collective unconscious, and owespits sepa- rate existence to that pulsating stream behind it. It is interesting here to record that Groddeck surmised that the unconscious, in the ordinary Freudian sense, is the precursor of reason, the brain-mind; whereas the it* produces the uncon- scious, the brain, and everything else that belongs to life. The unconscious is a part of the psyche, the psyche a part of the it. He also believed that whatever happens in or through a man, from I the moment of conception to the occurrence of death, even what 1 he reasons out for himself and does of his own free will, every- thing is directed by this unknown it. If we wish to consider the self in its widest sense as consisting of so many layers of consciousness, not unlike an onion, having ten"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"peelings or skins, then the Yechidah is the deepest, or central layer. Those immediately above it-and it must be remembered that this is figurative speech, and that the spatial analogue does not hold good here-are what we name the Chiah and Neshamah. These would correspond to the anima and the animus in the system elab- orated by Jung. Again referring to the Chinese mystical text commented upon at length by Jung, we will see that according to the Chinese the whole of nature is permeated by two principles, one positive or masculine, the other negative or feminine. These are named the yang and the ym.9 These two principles are present in the human psyche, and looking at it from the widest possible point of view, we could assume that the conscious level of the mind is the yang, and the unconscious is the yin. But this division, because it is the widest generalization, is inadequate and is capable of further classification. Because within the mind there are both positive and negative ele- ments, factors which are those of thought and feehg. This holds true also of the unconscious, and though we have referred this to the yin, with its sphere there is both a yang and a yin operation.10 If we refer to one of the deepest levels of the unconscious, then this yang and yin operation is what Jung means by the animus and animal and what the Qabalah indicates by Chiah and Neshamah. It may be useful to quote definitions of these two psychological principles to provide authoritative explanations as we proceed. One pupil of Jung's, Joan Corrie, the author of ABC of Jung's Psychology, says the following: The anima is in contact with the objects of the inner reality-the images of the collective unconscious-as the persona is in contact with the objects of external reality. The anima is an archetypalfigure that might almost be described as the precipitate of man's age-long impressions of woman-not his conscious reasoned ideas, but the unconscious inher- ited mould into which she is cast. The anima is a correspondence of the Neshamah which is femi- nine and passive, representing the true spiritual vision of intuition or the imagination. Here it may be interpolated that it has always been an axiom of the magical system that the being which is active physically is passive"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life 31 spiritually and vice versa. In many an occult work do we find some such statement as this: Man is termed the positive member of the two sexes. In reality only his physical body is positive. His etheric body is purely negative.. . . On the other hand, while the female is commonly supposed to be the negative of the two sexes, it is really her physical body that is negative, for her ethic body is positive, and the real creative pole of the sexes. It will readily be conceded that every person is psychologically bisexual.11 He is a combination of both masculine and feminine ele- ments, and within him operate the yang and the yin. In man the fem- inine elements, and in the woman the masculine or positive traits, are alike unconscious. And the deepest and truest archetypes of these unconscious traits are in the anima and animus, the Chiah and Neshamah. Here, after a fashion, is the explanation of the frequently observed phenomenon of the unparalleled tenderness and love of which many a man is capable, and the harsh and me1 lengths to which certain types of women may go when infuriated or aroused. Tme, therefore, to its compensating or balancing principle, the soul or unconscious of a man has a feminine bias which we refer to the anima, while that of a woman has a masculine bias, the animus. This latter is defined as a constantly changing figure, its energies in a state of continuous fluctuation. The animus is not a persistent unvarying figure as is the anima. The typical woman finds her con- scious feeling expression centered in one person of the opposite sex; she is monogamous externally. But, internally her unconscious is apparently polygamous, \"for the name of her animus might be 'legion.' He represents the logos principle,lz the masculine reason of her unconscious nature.\" On the Tree of Life, this animus principle is equivalent to Chiah, the will; this word also means life, animal life. This principle is the first creative vehicle of the es, as its other pole is Neshamah, under- standing and love. The will is in essence a dual principle; it presup- poses a beginning and an end. For obviously to will a thing is at once to admit that you have not that thing. To desire to be a thing is to assume that you are not the thing desired. True love, however, is cen- tered always upon one object, an object with which the lover seeks to identify himself to the exclusion of all else. It is this love which"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"fundamentally is implied in the term anima. To love is to under- stand. Understanding bestows insight and intuition. This is anima. Tao, animus, and anima, or Yechidah, Chiah, and Neshamah, con- stitute the innermost core of what we have chosen to call the psy- chic onion, the primordial principles operating in the deepest levels of the unconscious. It might be said that this is the level which is always in direct contact with the racial and universal lev- els of the collective unconscious-that dynamic and ubiquitous stream of life and vitality of which the Yechidah, together with its vehicles, comprise just one particular center of consciousness. Before proceeding further, and since I have used the onion as a metaphor of the self, it may be wise to quote a paragraph of Grod- deck's Exploring the Unconscious: We all of us fancy that we must have a core at the center, something that is not merely shell; we would like to hold within us some specially dainty kernel, to be a nut protecting thefuture, the everlasting. And we do not realise, cannot realise, that we have in fact no kernel, but are made up of one leaf on top of anotherfiorn outermost to innermost, that, in fact, we are onions. But in the onion every leaf shares its essential nature. The onion is honest right through, and only becomes dishonest, rotten, if it tries to grow a kernel diferentfiom the rest of it, and to destroy the peel as though it were something false, something no honourable onion should acknowledge.. . . Everything in us is a peeling, but in every peeling is the essential nature of the whole. The selfis an onion se2f. This is similar to the Buddhist conception. The triad of principles just considered, the Supernals,l3 being the more primitive part of the psyche, the ancient center which harks back to the countless epochs of the distant past, we must now turn our attention to its compensating and balancing aspect, the con- scious ego. %s clearly is a much more modem and recent develop- ment in the ageless history of the self-a comparatively modem evolution-a channel by means of which we have become conscious of the original primeval and fundamental unconsciousness from which we have emerged. And because of this development of awareness concerning these deeper levels of ourselves, so are we able to examine and understand them. It is by this particular evolu- tion that we are able to make conscious the content of the uncon- scious. This definition of evolution is practically identical with the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life 33 definitions of both psychology and magic-that is, that their objects are to expand the horizon of the mind, to enlarge the sphere or scope of consciousness itself. These methods are those of evolution itself. In magic, this conscious ego is denominated the Ruach. It com- prises those spheres on the diagrammatic Tree of Life whch are numbered from four to eight inclusive. It is an aggregate of func- tions rather than an integrated and single unit-which is probably one reason why some psychologists believe that this part of us is as yet very unstable in its formation. Also that the unfavorable and faulty circumstances surrounding the childhood of most peo-. ple greatly enhance the tendency to disintegration which already exists. This aggregate comprises memory, will, feeling, and think- ing, clustered about the ego itself, which is the central sphere- five in number. Its life-blood is the current of thought and perception just as the life-blood of the Supernals is the libido, the current of life and energy. The Jungian concept of the ego, or con- scious mind, is the persona, the personality which comes into rela- tion with external things. It is a mask. It is the individual's mode of adaptation to the world, his character as it appears to be and as he quite often himself conceives it. It is an evolved mechanism to acquire contact with the outside world, so that by means of expe- riences thus obtained the if, or the Yechidah, may come to a self-con- scious realization of its own divine powers and high nature. It is in connection with this persona, this thinking Ruach that we would do well to reflect upon two aphorisms of the Eastern psychological systems. At first sight, it would appear that they are mutually exclusive and contradictory. In one Eastern book it is written, \"The mind is the slayer of the real. Let the disciple slay the slayer.\"l4 This alone will be a problem to the average student. In the West, generally speaking, the universe is considered as having two large divisions, the physical and the mental or spiritual, the two latter being spoken of as synonyms. So that if the mind itself is defined as a hindrance to the perception of reality most of us would be plunged in a rather difficult quandary. The second is \"The essence of mind is intrinsically pure.\" Should we desire to translate terminology, we will find I think that the Jungian Tao, or the very deepest level of the unconscious, is as"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"near an exact definition of \"the essence of mind\" that we could find. It is only a popular and false misconception of psychological concepts that relegated the unconscious into a mere receptacle of the evil shadow-beings of human nature. Some have considered it exclusively as a receptacle retaining the primeval slime deposits, harboring the most violently explosive material. But in point of fact, as but little practical acquaintance with the problems of analysis proves, the unconscious does not harbor exclusively explosive motives. The unconscious stream only becomes explo- sive when the Ruach, the conscious mind, has repressed its legiti- mate and just activity. The taint of the Ruach is a self-sufficient conscious outlook. Its vice is an over-refined and emasculated atti- tude towards life. A river dammed somewhere along its channel is bound to flow over, and when this does occur the river cannot be blamed. Should there be necessity to erect a permanent or even a temporary dam, suitable precautions should be taken to ensure that some other channel is kept open whereby the excess waters may seek their outlet. So also with the unconscious. Itself-the essence of mind which is intrinsically pure-it is neither danger- ous nor explosive. But if the individual be prevented from having access to life due to some maladaptation to environment, some failure fully to express both the yang and the yin of his nature, that repression acts as a constant source of irritation, presenting always some likelihood of a psychic explosion. It is this false dam, the obstacle which is erected along the river's course-psychological resistance-which is the \"mind which slays or prevents the realization of reality. How many of us really understand life and the world as they really are? That is with- out projecting upon our perceptions, the desire of what we should like to be? Few have insight into our deepest motives, the real causes of our attraction to our friends, of revulsion from our enemies. There are not many I surmise, who can at all times account for their actions in terms of consciousness. The majority of us are moved a great deal of the time by involuntary compulsion. It is a true saying that habits are a necessity imposed upon us by evolution to ensure the smooth functioning of the psyche. But they are necessary only in so far as they do permit the psyche to function freely. And with many it is just"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life 35 that mass of habits and predilections which is the barrier to the free activity of the psyche. To question people as to the purpose of their habits, a survey of their activity and why they were formed origi- nally is to obtain much illumination as to what is implied by the phrase \"The mind is the slayer of the real.\" In point of fact, it is not the mind which inhibits our perceiving what is real, what is worth- while and desirable in life. It is the false development of mind-that mass of prejudices,. emotional biases, improperly formulated philosophies and superstitions, relics of the inheritance from mis- guided parents-which is here denoted. And until we do understand its nature and perceive its extent, never shall we be freed from its dominion, or released from its compulsion. And until we have thoroughly understood our own behavior, motives, and the mechanism of our own attractions and repulsions, we have no insight. Possibly then we should be able to perceive that underlying this conscious mind-which hitherto we assumed as the sole reality, the only criterion of judgment-is a vast area of inspiration and beauty which is the intrinsically pure essence of md. If we could open ourselves, or become fully conskious of, this essence so that its con- tent without distortion were capable of ascending within sight of our focus of consciousness, then should we begin to realize as never before the true nature of life and its problems. \"In such a case,\" remarks Dr. Jung in his Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology, \"the unconscious vouchsafes us that furtherance and assistance which bountiful nature is always ready to give man in overflowing abun- dance. The unconscious possesses possibilities of wisdom that are completely closed to consciousness.. . . It creates prospective combi- nations just as our consciousness does, only they are considerably superior to the conscious combinations both in refinement and extent. The unconscious may therefore be an unparalleled guide for human beings.\" When this state or condition of consciousness has been arrived at, when what formerly was unconscious has been brought within the horizon of consciousness, the entire character of life becomes changed and illuminated. Previously it was a thing of fear and horror. Nearly all men, underneath, possess some sense of inferiority and"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"insecurity. All seek in one way or another to rise above that inferior- ity and to discover some rock of security to which they may feel anchored. It is when we have attained to a realization of the \"pure essence of mind that inferiority is practically banished and security obtained; and then we can deal with life and our fellows. The ninth sphere or Sephirah on the Tree of Life is that of the Nephesh, which means the animal ~0~1.15 It is the sphere proper of the animal instincts and urges, what may in truth be called the Freudian unconscious-that which was conscious at one time or at one stage of development but which has since been lost to con- sciousness. It is regarded as comprising those psychic faculties which are not conscious. All the various automatic, habitual, and routine actions; all the things that we say and do \"without think- ing\" and all the thousand things we never really \"do\" at all, these processes are assigned to the unconscious realm, to the principle of the Nephesh. To it is related the cerebellum, the hind section of the brain, and it is intimately connected with the glandular and sym- pathetic nervous systems. As such it is that part of our being which regulates the circulation of the blood, the pulsation of the heart, our digestion and respiration. All the promptings of desire and the urges of passion that spring unbidden within us, have their seat in Nephesh. This is the underworld of the psyche through which we get comparatively close to nature, to the elemental side of life. It is the undermind in which function the primary instincts of self- preservation and reproduction. It is the seat of the sex instinct itself. The Jungian concept of the unconscious might be the appro- priate term for this side of life, as is held by the Freudian school, whereas the much abused word superconscious would be distinctly descriptive of the Supernal Sephiroth of the Yechidah, Chiah, and Neshamahl6 corresponding to the Jungian unconscious. The tenth Sephirah is that of the physical brain and the active physical body.17 Here it is that we find the receptacle in which the other principles have their abode, and the instrument through whch they function. This tenth sphere, Malkuth, the sphere of action, we may consider as active, as yang, when compared to Yesod, the yin, which we may define as the seat of the impelling instincts, predatory lusts, and animal impulses. On the other hand,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The TreeofLife 37 the Ruach, which is an active thinking principle, we likewise may describe as yang in relation to the yin of the Supernals, which are quiet, passive, and hidden behind the scene. Malkuth has innumer- able other correspondences, but a consideration of these does not at the moment concern us. It is obvious that disorders in the proper function of the higher or interior psychic principles will have their corresponding effect on the body which, as the tenth Sephirah, is but the synthesis of the preceding nine. Any conflict between parts of the psychic make-up will accordingly present a physical disturbance corre- sponding in position and intensity to the exact nature of the lesion. By purely empirical methods the ancients developed a vast series of correspondences between the various parts of man's body and his psychic constituents. It is this tradition which forms in reality the fundamental basis of what is true and valid in such arts as char- acter-reading, palmistry, phrenology,lS and the such. For as within, so without. And what is present within the mind is bound in some way to react upon the obverse of the psycho-physical medallion. There is another method of classdying the components of the psyche by means of a rather different view of the Tree of Life. The method just completed considered each separate sphere. But at the same time we may look at the Tree from the point of view of its lev- els or layers. In this event, taking the first Sephirah alone, we have what technically is known as the archetypal world. It is that under- lying essence of the unconscious which is the most primordial of all, its functions reaching back into the immeasurable past. It is a stra- tum whose characteristic is those symbols and archetypes which were first assimilated to the simple homogeneous structure, if it may be called, of the evolving consciousness. The Hindu system calls this condition or state Tu yal9 or ecstasy, absolute conscious- ness, and its experience in consciousness is of that rapturous type which the mystics of all ages have testified to as union with God. In this divine world, we contact those subtle images which the ancients called the gods. Or rather the ordinary every-day sphere of consciousness becomes invaded by a volitional up-welling of these archaic images and archetypes the first set of psychic forms, subtle,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"intangible, and dynamic, through which the libido flows on its out- ward journey from the it. The 2nd and 3rd Sephiroth constitute what is called the creative world, the state of Sushupti.20 It is that stratum of the primordial psychic sphere in which function the principles of the anirna and animus, wisdom and understanding. Therefore its reaction upon the ego would be through a stimulation of the creative faculties, and an enhancement of its entire horizon and field of awareness. As the second state of consciousness, it has a correspondence with dreamless sleep. Yet even this description is inadequate, for dream- less though its characteristic may be, it is too vital to be defined in so passive a way. In certain philosophic literatures, it is held that Sushupti is a state in which even criminals commune with the higher nature, and enter into the spiritual plane. It is said to be the great spiritual reservoir by means of which the tremendous momentum towards evil living is checked. Though involuntary with such people, it is constantly salutary in effect. The next level to be considered is comprised of the 4th to the 9th Sephiroth inclusive; it is called the formative world or Swapna. This is the world of dreams; it is the level of the instinctual drives and the dynamic urge to expression. Its images, the pageantry of dreams and the fantastic adventure of the night, are those supplied by the experience of the day although the dramatization of the actual dream is the exclusive content and prerogative of this plane. Where there is an effort on the part of the higher genius or it to transmit noble impulses or inspiration from its own divine realm, the state of Swapna has to be passed through. This passage colors the tenor of the impulse, imparting to what may originally have been pure thought and transcendentalism an emotional tone or feel- ing which is expressed in terms of symbolism. Thus whatever ideas are impacted upon our consciousness from higher spheres are tinted with the dream symbolism of the formative world. A wide knowledge of the nature and sigruficance of symbols, and an acquaintance with the operation of Swapna is necessary if the origi- nal message and its meaning are to be divined. Here we have, also, the emotional mechanism providing the drive and impulse to phys- ical action, the endocrine glands. For the physical positions of the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life 39 more important glands correspond to important centers21 and dynamisms of this particular level of the psychic structure. The 10th Sephirah corresponds to the active world, Jagrata,22the top layer of consaousness, the ego, that surface consciousness which attends primarily to the business of every day life. It is an evolution emergent from the dark secret levels of the unconscious and, para- dox that it is, has usurped the function and rule of the source from which it has sprung. On these four different levels of consciousness, which the Qabalists have called the four worlds, the several princi- ples of man have their operation and unceasing activity. It is precisely with these different phases of man's psychic nature that the technique of magic deals. Here is the motive of a former suggestion that analysis should be so co-ordinated with magic as to comprise the first stage of development. For in climb- ing the Tree whch is the formal expression to denote the realiza- tion of the Sephiroth from the bottom upwards, the first approached is the 9th, that principle of man whch is called the Nephesh. That is to say the next level of consciousness beneath the ordinary waking state of the active world, is the level of dreams and lurid image and picture. It is the most superficial layer of the unconscious-using this term as the composite of the formative, creative, and archetypal levels of the Tree of Life. The formative world is that of the warring instincts and unconscious conflicts, the realm of the predatory lusts and passions. It is with this particular level that the analyst must deal in the majority of his patients in order to resolve those conflicts that have their existence in that plane. If there be conflict and incessant warfare here, how can the flow of spiritual energy descend from the higher Sephiroth, or, depending upon one's point of view, ascend from the deeper levels of consciousness? If the direct result of an unresolved conflict is to tie a knot as it were in the psyche, naturally there is no free passage for the libido, which is thus thwarted and frustrated. How can access be obtained to the more primitive, diviner parts of the psy- che, those archaic levels of the unconscious whose nature is entirely spiritual, where function those principles which aspire to the super-human shining heights, if the channel be dammed and the way barred by conflict? If the message or revelations from these"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"lofty heights are changed in nature and perverted by the presence within the mind of a powerful and ugly complex, how can there be real magical and spiritual development? Since analytical psychology confines itself, by its own definition, to an examination and a clarification of the two upper and most superficial levels of consciousness, this process must be considered the preliminary aspect of magical routine.23 Where analysis preaches the gospel of re-education in the attitude towards life, and when we find psychological patients producing magical designs or mandalas of the type that Jung reproduces in The Secret of the Golden Flower, here we have an encroachment upon or a usurpation of the realm and function of magic, and a t~anscending of the limitations of the ordinary analytical technique. Just as the technique of analysis must comprise the first stage of development, so to my mind the second stage is occupied by vari- ous elementary techniques of magic. I say elementary advisedly, for it is only those elementary techniques which the average west- erner may ever feel inclined to take upon himself, being debarred from more intense application to the magical art by such limita- tions, among other things, as time, the necessity for a business and domestic life, etc. The more advanced magcal routines24 are for the exceptional person, and comprise the training of the human psyche to complete spiritual mastery. Splendid vision though this is, an ideal goal for the few, it is nevertheless outside the capacity of most of us who are obliged to live the ordinary life of the twentieth cen- tury man or woman. The preliminary techniques we may consider under several headings, viz: 1. The Qabalistic Cross. 2. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. 3. The formulation of the Middle Pillar and the Tree of Life in the Sphere of Sensation.25 4. The methods of Circumarnbulation,26 and the Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar. 5. Ceremonial Magic."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life 41 For the moment, I shall content myself with presenting a bird's- eye view of each so that a picture of the entire scheme may be envisaged. The first method describes a formulation upon the body of a geometrical figure the effect of which is designed to call into operation the deepest levels of the unconscious. If I say at the out- set that every technique of magic is intended in different ways to open the conscious ego's field of vision to the deeper, more spiri- tual aspects of the divine nature, there can be no possibility of mis- understanding. The procedure of the Qabalistic Cross is through the cultivation of a species of, what is called in psychology, the fan- tasy of encouraging the imagination to build images through which the power of the it may flow unimpeded.27 Though the most elementary, it is in reality one of the most important phases of magcal work. Indispensable to the beginner, it is of just as much value to the more advanced student. It is an axiom of magic that it is the divine will alone which is capable of conferring illumination and enlightenment, and so acting that every action of the ego has its correct place in the scheme of things. Thus it is that the Qabalistic Cross is the ideal means of placing the ego under the direct surveillance of the Yechidah, the divine will in every human being. It is an excellent method for rendering the con- sciousness porous and susceptible to the dictates of the more responsible and humanitarian levels of the unconscious. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, described as the second method, is the sequel to the former exercise. It is a tech- nique designed to eliminate from the psychic sphere those interior elements which are undesirable. By an effort of the imagination, the student visualizes those qualities or conflicts or psychic lesions which are not required. By means of vibrating certain sonorous sounds called anciently divine names, whilst tracing certain lineal figures both in the air and within his imagination, he is enabled to project them from him. With the projection outwards, and assisted by the increased flow of libido, they may be disintegrated by him. Other forces, archetypes of the deeper levels, are formulated and invoked to assist in so difficult a task. The entire ritual, properly performed, is one calculated to lead the student slowly but gradu- ally towards the heights envisaged by the system."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The most important routine method of spiritual development in the entire magical system is, in my estimation, the third exercise in my classification. If the student remembers the Tree of Life he will see that the Middle Pillar is a series of five spheres arranged in a sin- gle upright column. The exercise proceeds by the visualization of these Sephiroth as circles or spheres of light in various sigruficant parts of the physical body. More accurately, they are to be realized as centers already existent in the aura, which is for this purpose defined as an egg-shape of subtle electric matter, a magnetic field which sur- rounds and interpenetrates the material body of man. The object of this visualization is to awaken these Sephiroth in balanced activity as a means of providing the higher genius, as the it may be named, with a psychic mechanism by which it may freely function within consciousness at the intent of the ego. It will be recalled, as stated as an axiom, that certain of the psy- chological principles of man have their correspondence with various organs and limbs and parts of the physical body. The exercise called the Middle Pillar is a demonstration of this axiom, giving the attribu- tions of these principles as a practical experiment to be attempted. The visualization of the Sephiroth and the measured vibration of divine names arouse the centers of this aura, or Sphere of Sensation, from their former latent condition. The effect is gradually to bring into operation the dormant and hitherto unsuspected parts of the psyche. The results of this practice evince, for one thing, an unparal- leled increase of vitality and power. This induces and is succeeded by a calmer judgment, less perturbable by the affairs of the external life, though the capacity for dealing with it remains unimpaired. It pro- duces a solution to spiritual perplexity, bringing to an end the curse of indecisiveness, assisting the mind to a more responsive and open attitude to the dictates or intuitions of the higher self. At first, only the Middle Pillar receives attention. But as practice renders the student expert, even dexterous in manipulating his visu- alizations, he will find it worth while to lengthen the duration of the practice, increasing the field of his attention. Balance and equilib- rium brought within achievement by the formulation of the centers of the Middle Pillar, then the Sephiroth of the two side Pillars of Mercy and Severity are added to the picture.28 Progress is bound to"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Tree of Lifi 43 be slow and gradual here, but given patience and perseverance a new sphere of power and spiritual perception will unfold itself. As a means of giving poise to neurotic patients, and of assist- ing the task of analysis, the practice of the Middle Pillar may be recommended to psychologists. For by these means the con- scious mind is rendered calm and still, the desirable condition to permit the ascent of the archetypes and inspiration of other lev- els of consciousness. During the period of attention to the Mid- dle Pillar, dreams far more readily cross the threshold of consciousness, and as time proceeds, they seem very definitely to pertain to less superficial aspects of the psyche, to the regions which normally are very difficult to contact-the creative and archetypal worlds of the animus, the almost exclusive concern in the past of poets, mystics, and magicians. The fourth routine exercise, the Vibratory Formula, is funda- mentally an extension of the Middle Pillar visualization. Its tech- nique proceeds in a way similar to the earlier exercise. But here we confront a rationale of a different order. The theory here is that by awakening a power or level of consciousness within man's own sphere it is possible to contact the corresponding force in the exter- nal world or a similar level of perception and experience in the col- lective unconscious. Its intent is not only the development of the individual by rendering h conscious of his other principles, but to transform him into a willing vehicle and instrument of the uni- versal mind, of that great and uniform substratum common to the whole of mankind. It is within the power of man, by these meth- ods, to associate hself with the almost omnipotent vitality and spiritual value of those divine powers which as an aggregate com- prise the universe. It is the first step towards what is colloquially termed adeptship,29 that path by which man is translated into a voluntary co-worker with nature in the task of evolution. The final exercise is magic proper-the art of ceremonial magic. By now it should be abundantly clear that not all magic is ceremo- nial; that not necessarily does it proceed by way of ceremony or rit- ual. Nor does it always require the usual paraphernalia of robe, candle, incense, and lodge-room. There is much in magic which is not too dissimilar with the methods of meditation. That is to say, it"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"follows an interior route, and is a means of dealing with the psyche by way of the actual psychological instruments of psyche without reference to any external object, symbol, or piece of equipment. It is the technique of an equilibriated introversion. Just as the exercises described above comprise the second stage of magic as analysis is the first, so ceremonial magic as a dis- tinct method is the third. I will iterate that charlatans and mis- guided enthusiasts have done only too much to confirm general opinion in the belief that magic is sheer quackery, but the earnest student who has applied faithfully these fundamental principles, will, by his enriched nature, bear testimony to its value, both ther- apeutic and spiritual. Ceremonial magic has been misunderstood by overzealous bepers principally because there has been no general under- standing of the principles here laid down as rudiments of the work. Except in the rare cases of those born with a definite flair, it is quite impossible to succeed in ceremonial magic until a great deal of development has been obtained. And by development, I imply the awakening or formulation within of the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Development implies the arousing of the dormant power of the psyche. Above all else it means the ascent into consciousness of the light and love and wisdom of the higher genius, the Yechidah. Until that light shines above and through the student, and the magical power is operative within, ceremony must remain what it is for most people: a thing of habit and custom-a set of observances perfunctorily to be performed, celebrations in which there is no trace of virtue, of value, of power. The divine power once awakened, and the light of the higher self pouring through the mind, then ceremony appears in an entirely dif- ferent guise. It becomes a magical engine for the harnessing and directing of the power and consciousness of the psyche. Ceremony may be realized now as a means of mobilizing the hitherto unknown factors in man's constitution, and employing them for various ends, which depend entirely on man himself and the extent of his knowl- edge and spiritual development. Here is no place to utter portentous warnings about the use and abuse of magical powers and spiritual knowledge.

It is important that the reader not confuse the terminology between the two traditions. The four worlds' of consciousness according to the Hindu tradition (from highest to lowest) are Turya, Sushupti, Swapna, and ]agrata. The last three of these worlds relate to three planes of existence (causal, astral, and physical) and are said to be the source of the mantra AUM: \"A\" refers to Jagrata, \"U refers to Swapna, and \"M relates to Sushupti. The silence that succeeds each intona- tion of AUM refers to Turya, the highest state of consciousness. Turya is described as conscious dreamless sleep or meditative sleep. In the Western tradition, the Four Worlds of the Qabalah as placed upon the Tree of Life are Atziluth (containing Kether), Bn'ah (composed of the Sephiroth of Chokmah and Binah), Yetzirah (including all Sephiroth from Chesed to Yesod), and Assiah (consisting only of Malkuth). Atziluth is the divine world of arche- types, Briah is the creative world of archangels, Yetzirah is the formative world of angels and the astral realm, and Assiah is the active, material world. 20. The state of mind in dreamless sleep. 21. These are known as the Chakras. See Part Two, Chapter Eight. 22. Complete awareness of the state of mind. 23. This is excellent advice.

However, Regardie has derived the misuse of the word \"circurnambulation\" from original order manuscripts-see The Golden Dawn, page 347, line 7. 27. One of the tragedies of Western culture is the depreciation of the human faculty of imagination.

Spiritual mastery."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE THE QABALISTIC CROSS AND THE PENTAGRAM RITUAL S ome years ago, the principles of this exercise of the Qabalis- tic Cross were published in my book The Tree of Life, and I repeat the rubric as follows: 1. Touch the forehead, say \"ATOH (\"Thou art\"). 2. Bring the hand down and touch the breast, say \"MALKUTH (\"the Kingdom\"). 3. Touch the left shoulder, and say \"VE-GEDULAH (\"and the Glory\"). 4. Touch the right shoulder and say \"VE-GEVURAH (\"and the Power\").l 5. Clasping the fingers on the breast, say \"LE OLAHM AMEN (\"forever, Amen\"). The words employed are in the Hebrew tongue. Hebrew is so employed because the magical system first attained prominence in Europe since it was adopted by some Jewish philosophers whom we call Qabalists. Apart from this usage of Hebrew words, there is not the slightest implication of Hebrew theology or philosophy. The gestures themselves are a variance of the ordinary Christian Cross, making use of the last few phrases of the Lord's Prayer. That it is utilized in magical work is due to the fact that it constitutes an"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ideal method of equilibriating the personality and raising the mind to the contemplation of hgher things.2 The first name in the invocation is Atoh. This is a Hebrew word meaning \"Thou,\" the second personal pronoun. To explain this in the simplest possible way, may I say that there is some justification in metaphysics for this usage. The reader who has studied some phlosophy will have noted reference to a triad of concepts-such as the thinker, the thing known, and the act or result of cognition. The ancient authorities of the Qabalistic philosophy conceived that the deepest or most spiritual principle in man, which they argued was man's hghest notion of divinity, was just such a triad of a thnker, knowledge, and the act of knowing. To each one of these principles or functions of the hgher self, they therefore attributed a personal pronoun as a symbol. The tlunker, the Yechidah itself, manifestly was \"I.11 \"Thou1' was referred to the thg known. And the thrd person \"he\" was referred to the activity of the thnker-though all three were considered an indissoluble unity. But bearing in mind at all times the concept of the middle way by which the extremes of the opposites may be avoided, they chose as the word to express the higher self in ths slight ritual the second pronoun \"Thou.\" The other words employed are names of Sephroth on the Tree of Life. Geelurah or \"Power\" is that center numbered five on the dia- gram. Gedulah or \"Mercy\" is the fourth.3 These two are the centers represented by the two lodge room pillars, the two opposites encountered in everyday life. It is of these two centers that speaks the ritual in junction already quoted about unbalanced severity being cruelty and oppression. Malkuth is the tenth Sephirah. It is translated by the word \"Kingdom\" inasmuch as the ancients considered that man's nature was a kingdom of inconceivable extent, a kingdom of vast and wide complexity, one having over it a divinely ordained ruler, the Yechidah. The last phrase of the ritual is of little significance, save as it completes the gesture. The word Olahm means \"forever.\" But it can also mean \"world\" or \"universe.\" We would assume that it is so placed as a peroration because within the miniature universe which is man, there are innumerable elements and principles in constant activity, the entire ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 49 If the reader will bear these brief explanations in mind, the description of the rubric which follows will be seen to have more significance than otherwise might be the case. Atoh is a reference to the higher genius, the it. Malkuth refers to the body ths with the Yechidah being the dual expression of the living human organism, the two expressions of the yang and the yin, using these latter terms in their widest connotation. Gevurah and Gedulah, the two extremes of power as the hghest aspects of the ego, sigrufy the two modes of that ego's capacity for action and reaction. The final gesture, closing on a point whch is between these two extremes indi- cates the voluntary decision of the evolving psyche to seek a balanced position, the Middle Way a place which partakes of both the oppo- sites and yet which is not subject to their equal but opposing pulls. It has been emphasized that the fundamental task of both ana- lytical psychology and magic is to attempt to bring into operation the higher genius-or to bring into full working consciousness the content of the hidden and buried unconsciousness. We should remember the parables of the archaic philosophical religions whose fundamental tenet was that within man was a spirit, a dynamic center of consciousness which, because of its contact and associa- tion with matter, had been plunged into a profound sleep, a state of somnambulism. The problem is: how may this slumbering level of the primeval consciousness be awakened within us? By endeavor- ing to extend the horizon of consciousness, to enlarge the field of awareness so as to embrace what previously was unconscious is obviously a logical method. To become aware of all our actions, our thoughts and emotions and unsuspected motives, to regard them in their true light as actually they are and not as we would like them to be or as we would wish the onlooker to perceive them. It requires, to take ths step, an extraordinary degree of honesty and courage, both indispensable virtues to the student of psychology and magic. The more of this suppressed and forgotten material stored in ths at one time unknown or dormant side of our nature that can be raised into the clear light of the day by exactly so much do we awake from that inert stupor into which we have in the past been plunged. And also, by just that much do we liberate ourselves from the compulsion to nature's instinctual commands, and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"become freed from what Levy Bruhl has called the participation mystique. It is a phrase coined to express that peculiar unity with nature which primitive man felt and enjoyed, that participation in the unconsciousness of nature which only became disrupted as the evolution of mind made itself apparent, a slinking serpent within the peaceful Garden of Eden.4 But mankind, despite thousands of years of evolution, has not yet freed itself as a whole from this sub- jection to the unconsciousness of nature whereby it moves and feels without deliberation and without conscious volition. Here and there we do find an individual who has realized the snare and burden in which he has lived, and attempted accordingly to release hmself from the bonds in which he had been bound. Any system, therefore, whch recognizes these deep unconscious levels of awareness and vitality, insisting moreover upon that recog- nition, assists in the evolution of mankind. The Qabalistic Cross, so called, considered as a preamble to more serious and difficult work, indicates just ths awareness of other levels of consciousness, and the necessity of bringing them into operation with the human psyche. Not only so, but it recognizes that these newly awakened levels of power and consciousness may be deeply disturbing to the novice who attempts this voyage of discovery. Therefore, what is essential is that not only should they be awakened, but that they should be recognized and equilibriated in a balanced disposition. Ths also it is the object of the Qabalistic Cross to accomplish. One more word before proceeding to a description of the tech- nique of its performance. The tradition holds that these words should be vibrated and not merely enunciated. That is to say, the stu- dent must discover for hmself that method of humming or of pro- nouncing these words which will assist in the production of a vibration. Some find that these words uttered in a shrill voice is best adapted to the requirements. Others, including the present writer, have found through experiment and frequent test that a moderately deep pitch, slightly higher than the ordinary speaking voice, is most suited to produce the desired vibration. Each syllable should be evenly vibrated, no one being accented at the expense of another. The test of the vibration, strange though it may seem, is that it should detonate in the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.5"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 51 When vibrating a word forcibly, but not necessarily loudly, a tingling sense should be felt in every cell and nerve of the body, and it should seem particularly that in the hands and feet every atom and cell has become alive and is in a state of rapid vibration. Little more than this can be said in explanation without actual demonstration. But it is such a simple matter in which to attain proficiency that no difficulty should be experienced. The metaphysical theory involved here is that by means of vibration, the actual formation of the body-mind system may be changed and renewed.6 That is to say, the proponents of the system urge for a consideration of the fact that within a period of seven years the body has undergone a complete biological change and, during that time, has renewed its entire cell structure. It has ejected old and deceased organisms, and by means of the metabolic process, has built itself a new cell organization. The vibratory tech- nique, therefore, hastens the expulsion of dead tissue and unwanted molecules and particles so that new ones being absorbed into the system, whilst attention is devoted to expanding the field of con- sciousness, a purified body is produced through whch that higher consciousness may more readily function. It is principally a question of tactics. One could on the one hand content oneself solely with the task of widening the field of consciousness, altogether to the exclu- sion of bringing the body system within the scope of this purifying process. Or, on the other hand, the entire time and attention could be given solely to the production of certain obscure bodily changes-as do some oriental hatha yogis, to the exclusion and at the expense of desirable factors of consciousness. Magic, very sanely, combines the advantages of both points of view, eliminating the dangerous and harmful features common to the others. Always in a salutary way is the path between the two extremes indicated. When actually performing the Qabalistic Cross it is well to face the east, the place of the rising of the sun. Ths takes advantage of a prevailing symbolism which identifies the Yechidah with enlight- enment and wisdom, a spiritual concept always determined by and defined in terms of light. It is from the east that the light arises. Standing motionless, with the eyes closed should that render the act of reflection easier, endeavor to contemplate the nature of the Yechidah, that it is by definition, the quintessence of light, life, love,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"and liberty, and that these are the qualities of the essence of mind which is intrinsically pure. One very essential point constantly requiring recollection is that in the magical symbolism, as well as in that of psychology, as has been demonstrated, the various psychic principles have a spa- tial co-relative in the human body. That is, certain principles corre- spond to or have a special affinity with certain organs or limbs of the body. This certainly is a fact within everybody's experience. Emotion is almost always associated with the heart, reason with the head, passion with the genitals. The magical tradition simply classifies and considerably extends this list of affinities.7 Whilst considering the Yedudah, recognizing that it represents freedom and that its nature is light itself, the student should endeavor to visualize just above the crown of his head a spherical form of light. The diagram on page 73 (see Figure 4) will indicate its likely position. The symbolism places this above the head because, in the first place, since the Yechdah is the root of man's consciousness, it is a principle of whose presence the majority of us have never become really aware. Th~s is not to deny its existence, but only to affirm our previous igno- rance. Moreover, magical symbolism, which incidentally is of the same type as that employed by the unconscious, also affirms that ths divine genius, being the hghest principle with of whch we still have no awareness, has not yet fully incarnated with us. That is to say, it is a potency whch overshadows us-a principle which the race will be able to realize fully only some thousands of generations hence. The consensus of experienced opinion has it, therefore, that this overshadowing, no matter whether actual or only metaphori- cal-does assuredly exist, and that the psychc correlative of an over- shadowing is a center just above the crown of the head. Fantastic this certainly may somd at first. But I cannot make any attempt to just+ it or to defend it. And were I called before a tribunal of intellectual criticism, I would only recommend that the practice be followed as a definite scientific experiment, and the results experienced. Let therefore the student consider hs higher and divine genius, the core of his unconscious, as of the nature of wisdom and love and light, visualizing its sphere of activity as having an affinity with the region immediately above the head. After some seconds of ths"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 53 quiet recollection, let him raise his hand above hs head, then lower it to the forehead and vibrate the first word \"Atoh\" as though for- mally to affirm the presence of that genius. The hand employed should then be brought in a straight line down to the region about the diaphragm. Vibrate the word \"Malkuth.\" As this is done, let the mind dwell on the fact that as the hand descends, so does a stream of light descend from above, a steady brilliant ray of light permeat- ing him through and through. A shaft of light is thereby formed whch extends from the crown of his head to the soles of hs feet. Strictly speaking, Malkuth, the last Sephirah, is referred to the feet. For convenience's sake, however, we touch the breast or solar plexus with the mental recognition that it is the region of the feet that actually we have reference to and to whch the shaft of light is directed. This forms the first half of the exercise. Some seconds pause should take place here, in order to visualize and feel as strongly as is possible the presence of a brilliant ray of light. Then, shfting the attention from the central pillar of light to the left shoulder, let the student consider that here is a reservoir of enormous power, and vibrate the word \"ve-Gedulah.\" A ray of light should be commenced here in the imagination, and visualized to penetrate the breast until it reaches the right shoulder, when the remaining word \"ve-Gevurah\" is vibrated. Thus is formulated the horizontal shaft or the cross-bar of this cross of light.8 The first gesture traced a light-beam from head to foot, while the second one traced the ray from shoulder to shoulder. Interlocking the fingers on the breast, and vibrating the final word \"le-Olahm Amen,\" the student should endeavor to see a cross of light actually standing wihn him. None but very few may hope at once to suc- ceed in feeling hs, in obtaining the pulsing sensation of a cross of light vibrating with. It will require persistent and regular exercise before this sensation makes itself apparent. It is a significant devel- opment, marking a definite stage in growth. Some little preliminary practice in the art of visualization may be necessary, as well as in acquiring the ability of giving utterance to the names so that the sound appears to vibrate in a given spot. When ths is acquired a name can be vibrated in the head, the palms of the hand, in the hghs or feet, or elsewhere at will. As skill is obtained, and the sense"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"of the cross of light becomes more marked and definite, the opening pratice can be extended. That is to say, prior to visualizing the center of light above the head, the student should endeavor to expand the sphere of hs consciousness. By this, it is meant that he should try to imape with eyes closed that the body grows and grows until the height increases enonnously. Let hun formulate in hs own mind that the physical form heightens to such an extent that the head gradually touches the ceiling, goes through the roof, and finally that the sem- blance of a vast figure with head in the clouds of space is obtained, the feet resting securely on earth. In fad, from &us exalted point of view, the earth seems but a small globe beneath the feet. Having obtained ths sense of expansion, and it may be accompanied by a heightened sense of consciousness or of ecstasy, then let hun visual- ize during the first vibration that the ray of light descends from the heavens upon hs head, penetrating him and eventually illumining the region of his feet whch are set firmly upon the earth. The sense of expansion is a definite one, rendering the performance of the gestures of the Qabalistic Cross a much more vital and significant experience. The reasons given for the necessity of this astral expansion lies in the fact that the ancient mystical systems hold that the transcen- dental natu.re of man, the essence of mind, is infinite in nature, a positive void of whch no quality can be predicated. As one Eastern scripture puts it: Learned audience, the illimitable void of the universe is capable of hold- ing myriads of things of various shapes andforms, such as the sun, the moon, the stars, mountains, etc. . . .space takes in all these, and so does the voidness of our nature. We say that the essence of mind is great, because it embraces all things, since all things are within our nature. The instruction to expand consciousness, or to formulate the astral form as of gigantic proportions standing solitary in space, con- taining within itself all the forces and worlds of the entire universe, is a literal fulfillment of the above metaphysical postulate. Likewise, in some of the few Hermetic fragments that we mherit, there is sim- ilar advice. In fact, it states the techxucal process so excellently that I am moved to reproduce it here: Increase thyse2f to immeasurable height, leaping clear of all body, and surmounting all time, become eternal and thou shalt know God. There is"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 55 nothing impossible to thyself. Deem thyself immortal and able to do all things.. .become higher than all Height and lower than all Depth.. .to be eve ything at the same time in earth and sea and heaven. Think that thou art as yet begotten, that thou art in the womb, that thou art young, that thou art old, that thou hast died and art beyond death: perceive all these things together.. .and thou shalt know God. But ifthou shuttest up thy soul in thy body, and abasest thyself and sayest 'I know nothing, I can do nothing, I am afraid of earth and sea, I cannot mount to heaven, I know not what I was or what I shall be;' then what hast thou to do with God? (Corpus Hermeticum xi. lii1).9 Somethng of the sort can be seen in the writings of Plotinus.lo In any event, metaphysical or psychological or nonsense, only con- stant practice will determine whether it has validity and value, or whether these are simply delusions of unbalanced minds. The final test must be a pragmatic test; it is that of science itself.11 It will now be seen why it was stated above that ths practice is essential to all magical work. In fad it should precede or form part of any series of mental exercises upon which one may embark. Inas- much as it does endeavor to ally the personality with the true sources of life, permitting them in any event a species of open chan- nel to enter into consciousness, no words can underestimate or exag- gerate its importance. This is not to suppose that at once will the casual performer of the Qabalistic Cross become aware of the secret self of the unconscious, \"the flame whch burns in the core of every man.\" That is certainly not the implication for he who runs may not read. What is implied is that continuation in the way of regular prac- tice brings with it a recognition of the transcendental self. Or, to put it in another way a bridge is formulated between the conscious and the unconscious, permitting the mind to be made porous to diviner thgs. Gradually and almost imperceptibly the student will become aware of the inspiration of that higher genius. The principal error on the part of earlier writers on magic-and my earlier literary efforts are also included with the scope of these strictures-was that con- stantly they spoke of ecstasy and divine illumination and transports of spiritual delight.12 These experiences may be true of the more advanced or evolved student. For the average individual they can have but little meaning. What actually does occur is that there is a gradual connecting up of one level of consciousness with another."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"This links on to another, and so forth. Until finally, the everyday waking consciousness becomes permeated with an awareness of divine creative faculties whch have fertilized its intolerable barren- ness. Ths awareness marks the end of that interior sense of sterility and frustration. Here we have, in a word, the rationale of such mys- tical phraseology as \"union with God the \"spiritual marriage,\" \"alchemical nuptials,\" etc. There is, to state it differently, a gradual engaging of the clutch. By this method there is no violent grinding of gears. There is only an imperceptible and slow change-over to another speed, or rate of vibration as it is called, to another mode of functioning. The every-day wake-a-world consciousness becomes more refined and sensitive, aware of new possibilities, displaying an understanding of and an insight into life and experience which it never had before. A wide tolerance is developed. And an all-inclu- sive sympathy for and concern in man's problems is manifested where formerly there was self-centeredness and disinterestedness in anythg that did not touch upon personal problems. These are tests, experiential facts open to all, facts whch are of value only to him in whom that insight awakes by dint of persistent effort. For no one else has it the least validity. The Qabalistic Cross provides the preamble as well as the perora- tion to another exercise. Ths is named the Lesser Banishmg Ritual of the Pentagram. The rubric of it is as follows: 1. Perform the Qabalistic Cross. 2. Face east. Stretch out right hand holding a dagger.13 Trace a banishing earth pentagram.14 Vibrate the word \"YHVH.\" (Pronounced \"Yod-heh-vav-heh).l5 (See Figure 3, page 59.) 3. Still holding out hand and dagger, turn to the south.16 Trace another pentagram in precisely the same way and vibrate the word \"ADNI\" (\"Ah-doh-nai\").l7 4. Then turn to the west and trace pentagram. Vibrate \"AHIH\" (\"Eh-he-yeh).l* 5. Turn north. Trace pentagram and vibrate \"AGLA (\"Ah-ge- ia~7.19 6. Return to the east. Extend arms in the form of cross. 7. Say: \"Before me Raphael.\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 57 8. \"Behind me Gabriel.\" 9. \"On my right hand Michael.\" 10. \"On my left hand Auriel.\" 11. \"For before me flames the Pentagram,\" 12. \"And behind me shines the Six-rayed Star.\" 20 13. Repeat the Qabalistic Cross. The function of this ritual, though capable of extension in sev- eral other directions, is pre-eminently one of banishment.21 Its aim is to eliminate from the sphere of the mind those qualities or sensa- tions which the critical ego deems unnecessary. Its rationale is that a system of vibration may act upon the human organism in a puri- fying and strengthening way. Every molecule, every cell, astral, mental, and physical, is affected by this ritual, since the basis of every psycho-physical activity of man is grounded in these centers of energy and spiritual force. These microscopic points, or monads, are the minute sensitive points of spiritual consciousness--each of them a Yechidah or it to its own particular system or small universe. In the reality of their existence and function is based the deepest sense of man's individuality and the basis of matter also. Mind and body are not two separate things but dual manifestations of one and the same unknown unit. The result of the celebration of the Qabalistic Cross, the vibration of the divine names, the formulation of the four pentagrams, and the invocation of the archangelic forms in the four quarters, is that grad- ually coarser elements are ejected from the sphere of sensation. To take their place other particles, more sensitive and refined, of a lugher grade of spiritual substance, are attracted to the personal sphere and become infused into the character and nature of the physical and psychological constitution. The nature of these newly- acquired particles is such as not to impede the free flow of libido or of power and inspiration from the underlying levels of the uncon- scious to the superficial awareness of man. In this way a very real purification takes place, enabling the influence of the higher genius to penetrate the refined and porous brain to diffuse throughout the personality a more profound insight, and a keener zest and appreci- ation of life, and it bestows a greater ability to cope with it."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The ritual itself is not a simple movement, but is composed of several phrases. The first is that of the Qabalistic Cross already explained. The second consists of the tracing of a limiting circle, marked at each of the four angles or cardinal quarters by a penta- gram. Thrd, the invocation of the archangelic guardians. Fourth, the repetition of the opening gesture. Having expanded consciousness, and visualized hmself as a towering cross of light, let the student face the east of his room,22 stretchng before him his right hand. It is customary to employ a straight-bladed dagger with a cross hilt, but ths is relatively unim- portant for the novice; the fingers alone being quite adequate to the work. To trace the pentagram bring the outstretched arm over to the left side, to a point in front corresponding to just about the mid- dle of the thigh. Move the arm upwards to a point which would correspond to the top of the head. Descend on the right to about the middle of the right thigh. This movement will have traced a large inverted \"V,\" about three feet high. Move the outstretched arm over towards the left to slightly above the left shoulder. Then carry it horizontally to a point just above the right shoulder and then diagonally downwards to the point originally started from. Difficult and complex it may sound, but in practice it is very easy. If a five-pointed star is drawn on paper, it will be seen at a glance what the import of the above direc- tions are. They have been delineated at length above because, incredible as it seems, the writer has found some individuals per- forming the most outrageous gestures in the belief that they were tracing pentagrams. The only point to remember is to make a fairly large figure, about three feet high, and above all that it should be a well proportioned pentagram, and not a deformed or eccentric one. Some little practice may be required to achieve ths, especially in making the final diagonal so as to complete the gesture exactly where the initial ascending line began. This is all straight-forward enough. But this is the mere physical aspect of the exercise. In practice somehg more is demanded of the practitioner. While tracing these pentagrams with his arm out- stretched, his visualizing faculty must be active and alert. He must endeavor to imagine these four pentagrams as flaming figures of a"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Qabalisfic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 59 bluish-golden hue similar to that produced by igniting methylated spirit.23 After completing the phys- ical tracing of the figure, he should be able to perceive by the mind's eye, with the eyes closed, the penta- grams flaming quite vividly in front of him. Naturally ths requires much practice. And save for him Begin whose faculty of visualization is Here already very well developed, it is, unfortunately, a faculty not easily Figure 3: come by. Only exertion contin- Lesser Banishing Pentagram. ual practice will develop ths. Thus the first stage of the ritual is the visualization of the pen- tagram while actually tracing it with finger or dagger. when the commencing point of each pentagram has been returned to, let the student pause, and, imagining a central point in that figure, bring up hs arm to that center, stabbing or charging it energetically with outstretched dagger. It is at this juncture that the divine name should be vibrated, slowly and evenly. It suffices to vibrate each name but once. Each of these four names associated with a penta- gram in a different cardinal quarter has to be vibrated in precisely the same way as was directed for those names connected with the Qabalistic Cross. It should be endeavored to feel them operating within. Also visualize that as they are vibrated, the power of the name travels out through the center to the end of that particular cardinal quarter. Tlus procedure is to be followed in each quarter, the only variation being the different name employed. It will be noted that each of these names is comprised of four let- ters each.24 In the mystical system of the ancients e;ch was attributed to one of the four elements or the four modes of activity comprising our make-up,*5 and the ritual has direct effect upon these. It would take too long and serve no good purpose to dilate upon the reason why these names were supposed to be effectual, and why certain names were associated with certain quarters and not to others.26 Suf- fice here to say that the tradition has found them effectual for the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"purpose under consideration, and the experimental work of modem students has confirmed this psychological association. The student desirous of delving more deeply into the subject, wishing to discover the system by which symbolic names are attributed to certain quar- ters or to the Ten Sephroth, will find much material in The Tree of Life and My Rosicrucian Adventure, as well as in The Golden Dawn. The last pentagram having been traced in the north, the student returns, still holding arm with dagger outstretched, to the east where he started from.27 With hs arms extended to form a cross, and being aware about him of the four pentagrams vitalized by the vibration, he now commences a further phase of the ritual. Here is demanded of him the visualization of the vast archangelic figures standing behind each pentagram, as though the latter were a sort of flaming shield supported by those magical or telesmatic images.28 Some word or two needs to be expressed about archangels and angels. Most readers, unfamiliar with the nomenclature and gen- eral tenets of the magical phlosophy, may feel inclined to baulk at ths juncture. The postulate, however, is quite a logical one. For the philosophy of magic conceives of one root source from whch all life sprang, one fundamental life current, infinite and omnipresent, expressing itself in diverse ways. Ths we can call if we wish, God, libido, the collective unconscious-depending upon what system of religion or metaphysic we subscribe to. Within this universal life are archetypal images-nodal points which act as termini or power stations through whch, as it were, the root life-stream flows and is diluted or transmuted so as to be assimilable or available to a lower form of life. These primordial archetypes of the collective uncon- scious are the psychic \"forms into which repeated ancestral experi- ences have molded the typically human mode of apprehension.\" Generally speaking then, these primordial archetypes, man's first definition of the manifold forces of nature, comprise what in magic we mean by gods and archangels and angels. One very clever expositor, referring to the manner in which the ancient magicians conceived of these archetypes or magical images, expresses the idea thus: They took each factor in Nature and personified it, gave it a name, and built up a symbolicfigure to represent it; just as British artists have by"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 61 their collective efforts produced a standard Britannia, a female figure with shield charged with the Union Jack, a lion at her feet, a trident in her hand, a helmet on her head, and the sea in the background. Analysing thisfigure as we would a Qabalistic symbol, we realize that these indi- vidual symbols in the complex glyph have each a sign$cance-in fact, an occult glyph is more akin to a coat of arms than anything else . . . A mag- icalfigure is the coat of arms it represents. These magicalfigures are built up to represent the diffuent modes of the manifestation of cosmic force in its different types and on its different levels. They are given names, and the initiate thinks of them as persons, not troubling himself about their metaphysical foundations.. . . An angelic being, then, may be defined as a cosmic force whose apparent vehicle of manifestation to psychic con- sciousness is a form built up by the human imagination. When facing east, therefore, and vibrating powerfully the name Raphael, the student should attempt to build up in his imagination, or to visualize a vast angelic figure, conceived of in the traditional conventional style, of vibrating yellow and mauve hues. The whole figure, the visualization complete, will be gracious and slight and airy, and the mauve which touches up and brings out the vivid pale yellow will cause the robes to flash and shimmer, giving the impression of shot silk. It may also appear that a gentle breeze is wafted from behind the figure. In the south, the archangelic form to be imagined will have a predominance of flaming red, touched here and there by vivid flashes of emerald green. In the hand of the figure will be seen an uplifted sword of steel, while little tongues of fire will lick the browned earth about the bare feet. An intense radiation of heat should be sensed from Michael. Watery characteristics will mark the nature of Gabriel in the west, and blue offset by orange will be its color. A blue chalice of water will be held aloft by the telesmatic figure, which will sometimes seem as though it were standing in a rushg stream of clearest water. Some- times, it may seem as though there were a small waterfall behind the figure, pouring cascades of water into the temple or room. In the north, the angel Auriel29 will appear to be standing on very fertile ground, grasses and wheat being about the feet. Sheaves of corn will be held in both the outstretched hands, and on"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"the whole, the prevailing colors will be a mixture of citrine, olive, russet, and some little black.30 The techruque of here employing these telesmatic or magical figures of the archangels, once the appropriate names have been vibrated and some realization obtained of the presence of the cor- rect type of spiritual power flowing through the figure, is to imag- ine that the emanation from the archangel penetrates and cleanses the personality. That is to say in the east from behind the archangel Raphael should be felt a gentle wind or breeze which, permeating the entire body blows from it every trace of impurity. From Michael in the south, warmth at first of gentle degree should be felt, increas- ing in intensity to a powerful heat whch burns and utterly con- sumes every blemish whch troubled the personality. This purging should be felt as consecrating one to the service of the hgher self. The same technique should be applied to Gabriel in the west, except that one is purified with water, while in the north one is invested with the stability and fertility of Auriel, archangel of the earth. Of course ths sounds a most complex and complicated proce- dure to pursue. But with practice, the entire exercise will be found to be easy. First of all, the student should recognize that a wise man knows how to limit hself. He will limit himself at the start to obtaining mastery of the mechanical part of the ritual without refer- ence to the initiated techruque. That is to say hs aim should be to commit the ritual to memory so completely that at any particular quarter there is no groping for the appropriate names. Then each phase should be studied separately until skill and ease are achieved. He should apply hmself to familiarizing himself with the sense of expansion of consciousness and visualizing the descending ray of light whch formulates itself into a vast radiant cross with h. A certain degree of accomplishment gained in ths exercise, and already being skilled in the tracing of perfectly geometrical penta- grams in mid-air, the next task is to obtain about h a clear formu- lation of the blazing pentagrams, vivified by the vibration of the appropriate divine names being hurled through them. Application to the technique of purification by means of again expanding con- sciousness, whilst surrounding himself with the colossal magical fig- ures of the archangels comprises the next important stage. The final"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagrain Ritual 63 task is to visualize, before performing the Qabalistic Cross again, a pentagram of fire burning on the breast. Seen on the back is a hexa- gram, its ascending triangle being red in color, and its descending triangle of blue, both triangles to be interlaced.31 I hope the student will not be frightened by ths mass of directions, for he can be assured that the exercise is not nearly as obscure or terrifying as it sounds. Practice will make perfect, and the realization of the goal to be acquired will provide sufficient confidence to enable him to pur- sue the practice still further until complete mastery is acheved. In this way his mind being made quiescent, and hs body and emotional apparatus purified, the consciousness of the hidden grades or levels of hs being may gently and gradually ascend and manifest to hs perceptions, thus assisting h in his inward growth, in the conquest of ignorance and the acquisition of self-knowledge. Before closing this chapter, one final set of directions remains to be communicated with regard to this practice. Once skill has been acquired in performing accurately and effectually this Lesser Ban- ishing Ritual of the Pentagram, the student may endeavor to per- form the entire ritual in his mind. Seating himself comfortably in hs chair, facing east, he should endeavor, without so much as ris- ing or without any audible vibration of the words, to expand the form of his sphere of sensation and bring down the light of the higher self upon him. He ought also to be able to imagine himself as standing, moving forward to the east and tracing the penta- grams without moving the physical arm, silently or mentally vibrating the appropriate magical words. Likewise with the archangels. The mere determined effort to visualize them and men- tally pronounce their names will call up the figures, and evoke the type of force which should flow through them.32 My sole caution is against attempting what obviously is an advanced practice until literally months have been spent working away at the physical performance of ths exercise. ?fie writer knew some people who neglected to take ths piece of sound advice. Their work became very careless and slapdash, and whatever advantage was to be obtained from the ritual was never forthcoming. Ths astral ritual is, as I have said, an exercise to be undertaken only when a good deal of mental stability and control has been"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"obtained-results which follow from persistent application, two or three times a day for many weeks or months, to an enthusiastic and vigorous performance of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Penta- gram.33 Sudden spurts of enthusiasm followed by prolonged bouts of inactivity avail nothg in magical work. In fact, such an attitude towards the subject is indicative in itself of, if not neurosis, then of a very powerful conflict raging in the unconscious. It indicates that the opposites are still operative with the mental sphere, and that the Golden Flower of stability and equilibrium has not yet begun to blos- som. The student would do well to become fully aware of the conflict, determining to be affected neither by violent enthusiasms nor by equally violent depressions. Above all, he should perform quietly and patiently the Banishing Ritual. Let him continue steadfast, with courage and equanimity in the daily celebration of lus chosen work. Endnotes 1. For some reason Regardie has switched the natural order of the Qabalistic Cross. Here he has the student touching the left (Gedulah or Chesed) shoul- der followed by the right (Geburah or Gevurah) shoulder. In the Golden Dawn manuscripts, including those published by Regardie himself in The Golden Dawn, and in his book The Tree of Life, the Geburah (right shoulder) always comes before the Gedulah (left shoulder). \"The Power\" always comes before \"the Glory.\" In the Christian Cross performed by Roman Catholics, the left shoulder is touched first, but this still does not explain why Regardie suggests it here and nowhere else in his writings. We have no expla- nation for it. We suggest that the reader follow the traditional order of the Qabalistic Cross as presented on page 166 of The Tree of Life, page 53 of The Golden Dawn, or in Part Two, Chapter Nine of ths book. 2. The cross itself is a universal, pre-Christian symbol. It is our belief that people have been crossing themselves, in one form or another, since the beginning of civilization. 3. The more common name for this Sephrah is Chesed, whch means \"mercy.\" Its other title, Gedulah, means \"glory\" or \"greatness.\" 4. The serpent is often a symbol of wisdom. On the Qabalistic Tree of Life, the Serpent of Wisdom represents the paths that connect the various Sephroth. In the story of the Garden of Eden, the serpent suggested that Adam and Eve eat fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. This means that they became sentient tM- ing beings who were set apart from \"the unconsciousness of nature.\" 5. A tingling sensation can also sometimes be felt in the face."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 65 6. Scientists are now becoming aware of what magicians have known for cen- turies-that all matter is vibratory energy. There is a physical phenomenon known as \"harmonic resonance\" which means that if one object starts to vibrate strongly enough, another object nearby will begin to vibrate or resonate with the first, if both objects share the same natural vibratory rate. The magician vibrates a god-name in order to effect a harmonic resonance between the deity as it exists within his own psyche and as it exists within the greater universe. The aim is to have the psyche \"resonate\" with the divine. Not only does this lift the consciousness to a higher, more purified level, it accelerates the purifi- cation of the body through the expulsion of old dead cells. 7. In magic, such lists are called Tables of Correspondence. They can be found in several books, such as Crowley's 777 (Samuel Weiser, 1982), which is based upon Golden Dawn manuscripts), and Bill Wlutcomb's The Magician's Companion (Llewellyn, 1993). 8. Once again, Regardie has switched the natural order of the Qabalistic Cross here. \"ve-Gevurah\" (right shoulder) should precede \"ve-Gedulah\" (left shoulder). 9. Libellus XI. (ii), \"A Discourse of Mind to Hermes.\" See Scott, Hermetica, 90-91. 10. Plotinus was a leading Neoplatonist of the third century C.E. He strove to com- bine Greek logic and rational philosophy with mysticism and transcendental experience. His major work, the Enneads, was compiled by his student Porphyry. 11. For this reason it is important that the student keep a diary and record the results of all meditations, exercises, and rituals. 12. In addition to giving a mistaken impression of what spiritual growth is, it has also resulted in many seekers assuming that their meditations yield contact with \"Secret Chiefs or Illuminated Masters from the Inner Planes.\" Thus they mistake initial contacts with the higher self, along with corresponding images of personal growth meant for themselves, as important messages for all humanity, and they come to think of themselves as avatars or messiahs. This unfortunate tendency is an anathema to the Great Work. 13. This should be a special dagger that is only used for the purpose of banishing. In actuality, no such implement is needed, and the magician may simply use his index and middle fingers to trace the pentagram just as effectively. 14. Although the figure traced is the same as the Banishing Earth Pentagram, in the LBRP it should be referred to as the Lesser Banishing Pentagram. This is because it is traced in all four directions, alluding to the four quarters (sub-ele- ments) of Malkuth: Air of Malkuth, Water of Malkuth, Fire of Malkuth, and Earth of Malkuth. 15. YHVH is transliterated English for m7', which is called the Tetragrammaton or \"Four-lettered Name.\" It is considered the ineffable name of God. Each let- ter of the name is also attributed to one of the Four Worlds of the Qabalah: Yod = Atziluth, Heh = Briah, Vav = Yetzirah, And Heh Final = Assiah. 16.

Visualize a ribbon of light extending from the center of the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"first pentragram in the east to the center of the second pentragram which will be drawn in the south. The four pentagrams are thus connected to each other by an astral ribbon of the same color creating a magical circle, whose end must be linked with its beginning point in the east. 17. The transliterated form of the word Adonai, meaning \"Lord.\" 18. The transliterated form of the word Eheieh, meaning \"I am.\" 19. This word is a notariqon-an acronym for the Hebrew sentence Atah Gibor Le- OLahm Adonai, which means \"Thou art great forever, my Lord.\" The first letter of each word is used to make up the word AGLA. 20. The positioning of a hexagram behind the magician alludes to an advanced magical working in which the magician visualizes the Golden Dawn's Banner of the East within his aura. There are several variations of lines 11 and 12 given in many books; their differences are very slight. The version given here is consistent with that described in Regardie's The Golden Dawn. Another ver- sion states, \"For around me shines the Pentagram and within me shines the six- rayed Star.\" The total number of points formed by the four pentagrams (4 x 5), and the single hexagram (6) is 26, the number of Tetragrammaton and of the Middle Pillar. Another version is \"For about meJames the Pentagram, and in the column shines the six-rayed Star.\" This latter version, adapted by Crowley, is the one that we prefer. It can be found in Regardie's The Tree of LSfe with the word stands substituted for the word shines. The column here alludes to the Middle Pillar, and is a reference to the magician who stands in the Pillar of Balance. It also alludes to the unification of the macrocosm and the microcosm by a hexagonal column of light between a hexagram above and a hexagram below. (In this version the total number of points on the four pentagrams and the two hexagrams is 32; the number of the Paths of Wisdom, the holy name AHYAHWEH (the combination of Eheieh and YHVH, the macrocosm and the microcosm. One of the unpublished papers from the A0 (an offshoot of the Golden Dawn) suggested that line 11 could be either \"And behind me shes the Six-rayed Star,\" or \"and behind me shines the Hexagram of Light.\" This same paper states that a thirteenth line could be added if the magician so desired: \"And above my head the Glory of God.\" Whatever version the magi- cian chooses is a matter of personal preference. 21. Specifically the banishment of negativity, unwanted energies, or neuroses. 22. Most texts describing the LBRP state that the magician is to start in the east and finish in the east. We now feel it might be better to have the magician start and finish in the center of the room, facing east. He can move to the east to trace the first pentagram and then continue around the circumference of the temple. He would only need to stand in the center of the room whenever per- forming the Qabalistic Cross and the Invocation of the Archangels. 23. The pentagrams could also be visualized in flaming white light. White light has a tendency to be seen on the astral as bluish light by clairvoyants. 24. Each is a \"tetragram.\""},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Qabalistic Cross and the Pentagram Ritual 67 25. The element of fire corresponds to our will and feeling faculty, water to our creativity and intuitive faculty, air to ow intellect and thinking faculty, and earth to our faculty of sensation. 26.

A telesmatic image is an image constructed according to a predetermined set of correspondences. This image is then consecrated and charged to achieve a specific purpose. And the charged image becomes a sacred icon- a living symbol of the force it represents. 29. The archangel of earth. Also called Uriel. (Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel are the archangels of air, fire, and water, respectively.) 30. These four colors are the usual colors given for the Sephirah Malkuth, which has the element of earth generally assigned to it. These are also the colors of elemental earth in the King Scale. 31. These last two lines refer to visualizations in steps 11 and 12 in the LBRP. (Refer to Endnote 20.) Regardie's suggested visualization of a pentagram on the chest and a hexagram on the back results in a total of 31 points on the five penta- grams and the single hexagram, the number of the divine name A1 (5~). 32. This pravtice will eventually become second nature to the magician. For an example, if the magician is having a \"rough day at the office\" he can imagine himself at home, performing the LBRP in full regalia in his private temple space. All of this can be performed astrally and with great effect toward cleansing negative influences from the magician's psyche. 33. During tlus time the student should refrain from invoking and concentrate solely on banishing."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR THE MIDDLE PILLAR EXERCISE I t is my confirmed belief that several weeks at the very least of patient application to the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Penta- gram should precede any effort to perform the Middle Pillar. For one thing, it will have trained the student in several little tricks of routine and magical technique quite apart from the intrinsic virtues of the exercise, which is to purify and cleanse the entire sphere of personality to the end that the higher self may manifest through a purified body and mind. If the exercise has been labored at for two or three months, performing it two or three times during the course of each day, the student will approach the further stages of magic well-prepared, quite able to cope with and accommodate the increased vitality and power which will pour through him. It will be realized how necessary analysis is as a preliminary rou- tine to magic. The student should have arrived at a fair understand- ing of himself, his motives, and the mechanism of hs mind, and integrated himself more or less thoroughly so that no dissociation or serious neurosis exists wih the psyche. For the presence of a pow- erful complex of associated ideas in the unconscious, or a marked dis- sociation splitting off one part of the psyche from the other, will have the effect of short-circuiting the flow of energy generated or released by the Middle Pillar. An explosion in the form of a complete nervous"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"breakdown, or even of the destruction of mental stability will be a likely result. Many instances have been known of unprepared stu- dents contracting fatal physical illnesses through attempting work of this nature, though hs is more true where Eastern exercises have been unwisely attempted. Some of these unfortunates, when the dis- sociation was rendered complete, have succumbed to chronic melan- cholia or taken their own lives. These warnings are not intended to be portentous or terrifying, but only to impress upon the student the solemnity of these undertakings, a journey of self-conquest than which nothing could compare in importance or seriousness. To my mind, the exercise described as the Middle Pillar is the groundwork of all actual developmental work. It is a process which is the basis of magic. That this has been but seldom realized is obvi- ously at the root of the futile attempts to do ceremonial and perform ritual, of whch the general public hears every now and again. Even students of magic of many years standing have been guilty of neg- ligence in ths respect, and also in failing to recommend it to their successors. The name of the exercise is taken from the position of the central Sephroth on the diagrammatic Tree of Life (see Figure 2, p. 28). Ths exercise concerns those centers numbered one, six, nine, and ten. It also includes the shadowy center drawn in dotted lines, placed between three and four.1 For various reasons I cannot go into detailed metaphysical explanations as to the underlying philosophy of this shadowy Sephrah, though students who desire more infor- mation about it will discover the elaboration of ths theme in my Garden of Pomegranates and My Rosicrucian Adventure. Suffice to say here that it arises from a consideration of the process of evolution on the one hand, and the two pillars previously referred to, on the other. The ancient phlosophers who developed ths system believed that as man evolved, that is to say as he developed suffi- cient control over hs emotions as to be able to remain poised in a detachment from the dual pull of the opposites, so there developed withn hrm a new faculty of discrimination and spiritual discern- ment. Psychologically this idea has been verified. For it has been said that as the over activity of the superficial mind, the flitting from one thing to another, prevents creativeness, so equally does inertia, dullness and the unwillingness to move. If fact, any of the two"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 71 extremes or opposite modes of behavior or thnking are characteris- tic of the unevolved man. As was said by one magician \"The Secret of Wisdom can be discerned only from the place of balanced power\"2-that is from between the two temple pillars. Poise at a thrd point, which neutralizes to some extent the violence of the swing of the psychc pendulum from one extreme to the other, is the result of cultivating equanimity, representing an equal capacity to be either at rest or active, interested or withdrawn at will, and not from emotional compulsion. Trus central point between the two symbolic pillars of the oppo- sites, the place of balanced power from which the working of the opposites may correctly be viewed, is the implication of Daath, whch is the name of this shadowy Sephah. Rightly it is shadowy and the word is used advisedly for in the majority of us who have not culti- vated the difficult art of avoiding the opposites, the development of ths new principle has proceeded with the utmost slowness. It is a new factor of adaptation or equilibrium, especially between the two broad divisions of consciousness-the ego on the one hand with its desire for adjustment to modem life with its refined and non-natural conditions, and on the other hand with the superficial levels of the instinctual life, concerned with primitive things, of self-assertion and the unbridled gratification of its every wh and caprice. It is ths new factor of adjustment whch comprises the principal impetus to what has been variously called in the east the Golden Flower, and in mediaeval Europe the growth of the Red Rose upon the Cross of Gold.3 It is the Stone of the Philosophers, the medicine of metals.4 To the four central Sephroth plus the shadowy Daath as the fifth, are attributed divine names-whch, as in the former exercise, are to be vibrated powerfully in conjunction with the imaginative formulation of various images. Let me expatiate upon these divine names by stating that they may be considered as the keynote or vibratory rates of various degrees or grades of consciousness. In their prolonged investiga- tion into the hdden knowledge and the secret side of man's nature, the ancients who were as empirical scientists as our psychologists today, came to associate various sound-values or rates of vibration with various parts of the body, and also with particular types of"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"magnetic force and strata of consciousness. No religious or meta- physical theory need attach to the employment of these names. The system rests entirely upon its own merits. The simplest way of regarding them is, as explained above, as vibratory rates. Again, they may be considered as key notes by means of which access is obtained to the consciousness of the different parts of our being, the existence of whch hitherto we have been kept in ignorance.5 With each of these five centers there is associated a divine name to be used as a vibratory formula. The attributions as we have received them, together with the traditional name of the Sephroth, are given below with the names of the principles active in the human psyche. The numberings are those that appear on the Tree.6 1. Kether-Yechidah \"AHIH (pronounced \"Eh-he-yeh) Daath-The Link \"YHVH ALHIM (\"Ye-hoh-voh E-loh-heemn)7 6. Tiphareth-Ruach \"YHVH ALOAH ve-DAATH (\"Ye-hoh-voh El-oah ve- Da-ath)g 9. Yesod-Nephesh \"SHADDAI AL CHAI\" (\"Shah-dai EI Chain)9 10. Malkuth-Body \"ADNI HARTZ\" (\"Ah-doh-nai ha-Ah-retz\") The divine names and the names of the Sephiroth should natu- rally be committed to memory, as also the following scheme of their position or relation to parts of the human frame (see Figure 4, p. 73). Kether, the first Sephirah, is a center of light, and in the Qabalistic Cross, it is attributed to a center posited slightly above the crown of the head. It refers to that higher genius or it which, not yet fully incarnated within, broods above, a silent watcher. It is for each of us the source of inspiration and freedom and enlightenment. It is life itself. Daafh, the shadowy Sephirah, which develops in the course of evolution as we learn the domination of our mental and emotional propensities, is situated at the nape of the neck. Its position is at a point on the spine just below the occiput, about one or two inches"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Figure 4: The Middle Pillar."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"above the larynx, and its diameter may be imagined to be about four inches in extent. It is conceived to be a symbolic link, self- induced and self-devised, between the hgher genius on the one hand, and on the other, the ego, the conscious self referred to that group of characteristics clustered around Tiphareth. On the Middle Pillar, Daath connects the higher faculties to the ego, Kether to Tiphareth. This latter Sephah is resident in the neigh- borhood of the heart, and its sphere extends from the diaphragm or solar plexus more or less to the spine. Its center may be imagined to be the lowest point of the sternum or breast-bone to which the ribs are attached, its diameter being about six inches. Below Tiphareth is Yesod, a center which is referred to the region occupied by the generative organs, and its size should be visual- ized as of the same dimensions as Tiphareth. The final center is Malkuth, referred to the feet, and it will be found by experience that the ankles comprise the periphery of a visualized sphere about four inches or so in diameter, the center being the sole of the foot. The method of working this practice called the Middle Pillar is to stand upright, hands to side, eyes closed, breath being inhaled and expired steadily. Above all the mind should be quiet, calm, and still. When familiarity with the exercise is obtained, it may be per- formed sitting or lying down. These preliminary conditions being fulfilled, let the student begin by transferring his attention to that region immediately above the crown of hs head, where he should endeavor to visualize a sphere of white brilliance. To accomplish ths may take some little whle. Several attempts may be required before any realization of ths center occurs. But when it has been obtained, let it be regarded with a certain sense of devotion, and contemplated as being the spatial correlative or correspondence of the vital core of hs being. This devotional attitude should enliven it considerably, and the sense of light and power, the first avenues of sense by whch this hgher phase of consciousness may be grasped, should increase wholly beyond anticipation. At this junc- ture let him vibrate three or four times, slowly, the name Eheieh.10 Ths is a Hebrew divine name meaning \"I am\" (or more accurately \"I will be\") a statement whch in reality is all that one can truthfully say of the self. Every other characteristic and quality belongs not to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 75 its own intrinsic nature but to the vehicles and sheaths of con- sciousness through which it functions. Steadfast in the contemplation of this source of power and enlightenment, he should endeavor to feel that an all-penetrant beam of brilliance is emitted downwards towards the nape of the neck. Here it widens, expanding to form a brilliant center similar to, though smaller in diameter than, that above the head. Applying the same vibratory technique here, whle realizing that this is not his divinity but its conscious link or point of contact with his ego, the student should again feel the radiation of power and vitality. So marked and powerful should this become at this juncture that even in the palms of his hand will the vibration of energy be felt as almost of a physical nature, and quite possibly a prickling sensa- tion will be noticed in the head and neck. A quite indescribable sense of poise and mental quiescence should also be experienced- no inconsiderable attainment, no small acquisition in these days of hurried business life and social fluttering. After several vibrations of the appropriate name, again the beam of light should descend to the heart or region of the solar plexus, and from there a warmth and a quite different sense of power will gently radiate as though from an interior sun. Here too, a name should be slowly vibrated in such a way, whch can only come through practice, as to detonate precisely in the physical area being contemplated and not in another. It must be felt to vibrate in the region between the diaphragm and the point opposite to it on the spinal column. Pass in contemplation from the heart to the center of the genera- ' tive organs. Visualize the sphere of light and vibrate the name, employing the same techruque as before and noting carefully the reaction in consciousness. Some minutes having been spent arousing hs center and vitalizing in with power, pass downwards to the feet where the magical center will be found to awaken quite easily In point of fact, it will be discovered that the mere contemplation of Kether, the center above the head, will by reflex action bring into operation the Malkuth center, these being the two poles, height and depth, of the Middle Pillar. This very briefly is the technique. Little can be said which the zealous student will not be able to discover through application to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"it. If the student spends about five minutes in the contemplation of each Sephrah on the middle column, the exercise will take approx- imately twenty-five minutes to half an hour. And surely there is no one so busy today who cannot devote at least one half hour a day to the task of self-mastery, to the cultivation of spiritual insight, and in the quest of his own divine nature. My own plan of personal instruction, one developed some three years ago, was to perform this exercise sitting beside that stu- dent I had decided to teach. The principle involved was that of induction. I assumed that by bringing into operation the centers within my own sphere of sensation whle sometimes, though not invariably, holding the hand of the student, the unawakened cen- ters of the latter would react and revolve out of sympathy, or by reflex. It amounted, in a word, to a sort of initiation, and powerful it may become too. And I discovered that whereas the average stu- dent took some whle before stumbling upon the best means of producing the desired results by the Middle Pillar, those few stu- dents whom I had initiated in this way were capable of performing the exercise immediately after in a highly successful way, even when away from my presence and atmosphere.11 When seeking for the ideal technique of initiation, to perfect a rite of initiation from a purely individualistic point of view, one of the methods I kt upon was the combination of the Middle Pillar formula with an actual ceremony. That is to say, by ceremonially invoking a spiritual force by means of the appropriate pentagram or hexagram ritual, vibrating congruous divine names, and per- forming the Middle Pillar in a room or temple thus powerfully charged by the manifestation of this spiritual force, the result was all the more effectual and definitely realized in consciousness.l2 A simple ceremony which invokes the divine and archangelic currents of elemental force, using invocations composed of ecstatic passages from various sacred scriptures, is almost ideal for the pur- pose.13 Not only does hs method succeed in providing a neophyte with an introduction to the light of his own hgher genius and to the realm of magic, but it is a supreme techmque of self-initiation.14 Vari- ous changes may be rung on a simple theme. And according to the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 77 student's own ingenium and spiritual aspiration, so will he devise several methods of employing the techniques I have described above. There will be some who will propound belabored theories as to suggestion-that because I consciously or otherwise suggested to these students that there were magical centers existent within their own system, their unconscious accepted the suggestion and pro- duced the looked-for result. Others, yet again, will murmur the magical word \"telepathy\"-arguing that I projected, though not necessarily deliberately, certain ideas or sensations from my mind into that of the receptive student who thus was influenced against his own better judgment or skepticism. With none of these am I wholly in accord, though in each of them may be some germ of truth. None of them answer the facts of experience. And I can only suggest that these people would do far better to apply themselves zealously to a little experimental work rather than waste time in vain explanations and baseless theories. Some will note that this exercise corresponds in some ways to the yoga chakra system.15 There is, assuredly, correspondence. But there are several very important differences and variations. The first, a minor difference, is the number and position of the centers involved. But this does not require discussion. What is fundamen- tal, however, is the entirely different approach. The yoga techmque commences its meditations from the lowest chakra and works upwards to the Sahasrara above the head. On the other hand, in the western system, the Middle Pillar starts from the highest and works downwards. In a word, the Western ideal is not to escape from the body but to become involved more and more in life, in order to experience it more adequately, and in order to obtain a mastery over it. The ideal is to bring down godhead so that one's manhood being enriched may thereby be assumed into godhead. Always does this system begin from the real center of working- the hgher genius which, by definition, is in contact eternally with whatever infinite deity there may be. That is to say, through the Yechidah we have immediate access to all the dynamic inspiration and spiritual power of the collective unconscious. By the magical hypothesis, the higher genius corresponds within man to the possible relationship of God to the universe."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"That is to say, man being the microcosm of the macrocosm, a reflec- tion of the cosmos, is a universe within himself, a universe ruled and governed by his own divinity. So whatever magical work is undertaken must always be in accordance with the dictates and under the surveillance of that higher genius. And since, at first, there is no immediate method of realizing whether any particular magical effort has the approval, to state it simply and naively, of the higher self, the sole course of action must be for the student to place himself in alignment with that genius. This is done by invok- ing it at the outset of any magical operation, and trusting to be made a vehicle of wisdom and understanding16 The first move- ment of the Middle Pillar-as also the Qabalistic Cross, which is a quick method of obtaining the same result-achieves precisely that. For since the source of life and love has always been con- ceived of as light, the preliminary step is to perceive that brooding brilliance above which is the emanation of, or the direct center through whch manifests, that hgher genius, or with which the lat- ter is in especial sympathy. And the remaining steps are deliber- ately to open one's manhood as it were to the descent of divinity-to bring down the light into the personality. Here it must be emphasized lies the vital distinction between the yoga chakra system of the Hindus and the magical exercise of the Middle Pillar. At first such a descent is characterized by an increased sense of power and vitality. Gradually ths widens to emotional quiescence and control with a mental poise, followed by a gradual broadening and enhancement of the entire mental horizon. There is yet another hghly useful application of this formula. It is to the art of healing that I refer.17Formerly when I employed mas- sage and magnetic healing in my professional work I found the Mid- dle Pillar and the spiritual energy that it generates and makes available of inestimable value.18 Cases of nervous exhaustion, catarrh, constipation, incipient consumption, pleurisy and many another will respond in an incomparable manner to ths combina- tion of massage and the willed communication of power. That is to say, using effleurage and friction, especially on the spine, as the prin- cipal massage techmque one should place oneself en rapport with the hgher self by the contemplation of the center of light above the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 79 head. By silently vibrating the divine name appropriate, one is enabled to tap a tremendous source of healing power whch is infi- nitely greater than that which ordinarily one has at one's disposal as an average human being. This magnetic or spiritual power flows through one steadily and powerfully. Directed by a calm will, and assisted by a clear visualized idea of the result desired, it may be com- municated like an electric current through the arm and hands to the finger tips. Thence it enters the patienYs body as the palms of the masseur's hands glide over the surface being treated. It requires some little practice to retain awareness of this divine Light whde engaging in so strenuous a physical effort as deep massage, but it is not an impossible one. It is a great help if the visualization of the sphere above the head is attempted whilst walking, for example. When this can be done, then its employment for the purposes of healing is quite simple. I can commend it unequivocally, both to physicians and psy- chologists. It is my hope that analysts will take over the technique for use in their own consulting rooms. Let them adopt it in its entirety as the one ideal method of inducing the right state of mind appropriate to free association and the cathartic confession. Should its present form be considered unsuitable, I reiterate that it has possibilities which render it worthy of being remodeled in the light of present-day psychological knowledge to suit modem contingencies. There are several little physical helps which greatly enhance the degree and amount of power which can be made available. Correct breathing, especially, is one of them. There could hardly be a better adjunct than breathing in a rhythmical manner. The latter in itself, quite apart from the Middle Pillar, is supremely efficacious in producing quiet and calm. The entire system is stilled and strengthened as the lungs slowly take up a rhythm, and keep to it indefinitely. First of all the student should train hself in the method of breathg correctly-that is to say, in the method of filling his lungs with air from the very bottom. He should combine abdominal with both diaphragmatic and costal breathing. The act of inspiration, if carefully observed, consists of these three phases. First the abdomi- nal part of the lungs are filled, then that underlying the diaphragm, and finally as the shoulders are slightly lifted the thorax itself"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"becomes filled. They are so continuous as to appear an undivided act. In this way, every cell of the entire lung surface comes into con- tact with the oxygen haled, which is thus passed into the blood- stream. Most of us usually breathe very insufficiently, only a fraction of the cellular surface of the lung coming into contact with the inhaled air. Thus there is always a large quantity of residual air in the lower reaches of the lungs. There is always a large surface of the lung area whch is not employed; and a quantity of carbon dioxide and cells in an impoverished state of health are ever present. This method of breathng introduces a far greater content of oxygen into the lung, destroying therefore, by combustion, toxins and undesirable elements, and also producing a better state of health. There are many individuals who, because of conflict and neurosis, have attempted to flee from life. They have attempted to evade a full contact with the stream of vital experience, and this psychological attitude of evasion has reacted upon the bodily func- tions. One of these particularly affected is that of breathing, the lungs falling into the habit of functioning at about half their proper capacity. The circle is a vicious one. For inadequate breathing by itself induces an enfeebled state of health, perpetual exhaustion, catarrh, and many another ill. Likewise, this constant state of ill- health reacts upon the mental outlook, confirming and strengthen- ing the escapist attitude towards life because the individual is now only half alive, incapable of reacting to the pleasures and joys of life. For mind and body, as so often reiterated in these pages, are not two distinct units. The functions of the one interlap with and interpenetrate the functions of the other. More accurately they should be regarded as the two functions of one entity, two methods whereby it may acquire experience. Too much therefore cannot be said of the necessity for cultivating the lungs to operate at full capacity. This cultivation cannot be too often stressed, for life is power, and power is life and consciousness, indispensable in the path of magic which leads to the knowledge of the higher self. The proper method of deep breathing having been acquired, the cultivation of a rhythmic breath should be the next step. The most suitable and simple method is the four-beat rhythm. If the student will hale very slowly, mentally counting one, two, three, four and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 81 then exhale to the same beat, he will discover that this undoubtedly is the best rhythm for inducing that state of calmness and peace whch is so necessary for meditation and reflection. And, in passing, let me add that the state of quiescence sought after is one not of pas- sivity and negativity. It is one of alertness and eagerness. What one should cultivate is a quiescence in whch every mental faculty is alert, waiting to be used. A tranquility characterized by a sense of enormous power and capacity is the state to be aimed at, one in which there is the maximum of awareness and inner poise. Success in the techmque of the rhythmic breath is an unmistak- able symptom whch cannot fail to be recognized when it arises. There is first the sense of peace, satisfaction and quiet joy, without the least cessation of one's mental capacity. Next follows a sense of vibration felt all over the body, as though every cell and molecule were acting in unison and moving, as it were, in a single direction. The result of ths vibration is to transform the lungs and the entire body into a single storage battery, generating and storing electric- ity and power, transmuting them into will and faculty. Hard upon this, if the rhythm be persisted in, comes a quiet ripple over the diaphragm or solar plexus-a difficult symptom to describe, because it produces no perceptible physical or recognizable change, though the sense of the rhythm is none the less distinctly felt. When this occurs, and when one becomes aware of a single vibration through the body, and a gentle vibration or sense of lumi- nosity and lightness in the brain, the student may be assured that he has acheved success in this particular practice. Ths state gained, the Middle Pillar should be proceeded with, and the names could be silently vibrated in tune with the rhythmic inhalation and exhalation of the breath. The sense of the brilliance above whch I prefer to thuds of as the \"lamp above the head,\" or as others have called it \"the candle of vision,\" becomes much more per- ceptible and marked. Very often it develops into an awareness of a whrling sphere of fiery light radiating peace and illumination into the mind and body. Little more need be said, for I have no desire to provide material which may act upon suggestible minds. There are people so constituted as to be able to produce symptoms of any described kind with the least application, and with practically no"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"spiritual effect upon themselves or their mental or moral nature, and certainly no progress in that path wluch leads to the knowledge of the higher self. Silence with reference to symptoms and results is therefore most desirable. Endnotes 1. Ths is Daath, which is not a Sephirah, but rather a conjunction of Chokmah and Binah. 2. From the Neophyte Ritual. See Regardie, The Golden Dawn, 129. 3. The symbol of the Rosicrucians. Rosicrucianism is a form of mystic or esoteric Christianity whose teachings embrace the Hermetic sciences. 4. The Philosopher's Stone is an alchemical symbol of true spiritual attainment. The search for the Philosopher's Stone is the search for truth and illumination. 5. Along the same lines, each letter of the Hebrew alphabet has a musical note attributed to it. Thus each divine name in Hebrew can be sung or played on a musical instrument. See the Appendix: The Musical Qabalah. 6. In this list, Regardie has given the name of the Sephiroth of the Middle Pillar next to their corresponding part of the soul. Beneath that he has provided the divine Hebrew name that is to be intoned or vibrated in the exercise. Thus Kether, which is equated with the Yechidah, is activated in the aura by vibrating the divine name \"AHIH\" (whch is the transliteration for Eheieh 797X), and so on. 7. Daath has no divine name of its own, so in the exercise of the Middle Pillar, it \"borrows\" the divine name for Binah whch is the highest Sephrah that is close to Daath. (Since Daath is usually considered a passageway to the Supemals, Binah would be the Sephirah at its point of termination.) Although Regardie states here that YKVH is to be pronounced as \"Yeh-hoh-voh,\" we see no reason it should be pronounced differently from the way it is pronounced in the LBRP-as \"Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh.\" The term Jehovoh or Jehovah is simply a tran- scription of the Four-lettered Name YHVH-the letters of which were merely considered as stand-ins for the actual name of God, which was unknown and unpronounceable. We believe that the divine name YHVH Elohim should be pronounced \"Yod Heh Vav Heh El-oh-heem\" in all Golden Dawn rituals. Some modem magicians believe that the divine name given for Daath (and for Binah) should not be pronounced as YHVH Elohm. They argue that YHVH was never vocalized by devout Jews who thought it was too holy to pronounce. Whenever it occurred in writing, the words Elohim (god or gods) or Adonai (lord) were always spoken as a substitute word for YHVH. Thus some magi- cians contend that the compound word YHVH Elohim is a mistake, and that what was intended was that the spoken word \"Elohm\" be substituted for the written word \"YHVH in Binah and in Daath. (The second word in the com- pound name YHVH ELOHIM was considered by Jews as a reminder that the holy name YHVH is never spoken but rather vocalized as \"Elohirn.\") While this"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 83 argument may be true for devout Jews, it is not valid for practicing magicians in the tradition of the Golden Dawn. There are several examples of Hebrew mys- tics vocalizing the various permutations of the Tetragrammaton for specific rit- ual work with the Sephroth. This points to the differences between orthodox Jewish practice and the esoteric practice of western Hermetic magicians. 8. For the same reason indicated in the above endnote, the divine name here should be pronounced \"Yod Heh Vav Heh El-oh-ah ve-Dah-ath.\" 9. The \"ch in Chai should be pronounced like the Scottish word \"loch.\" 10. Another common suggestion is to vibrate the name several times until it fills the mind completely, and no other thoughts remain. One other method is to pronounce the name as many times as there are Hebrew letters in the name. 11. Ths type of Middle Pillar initiation can also be used to charge talismans. Regardie used this techmque to charge one of our medallions. (For more on &us, see Part Two, Chapter Ten.) 12. One very potent combination of such rituals is the LBRP, succeeded by the Rose Cross Ritual, and followed by the Middle Pillar Exercise. The RCR can be found on page 306 of Regardie's The Golden Dawn. 13. See Regardie's Revised Middle Pillar Ritual for 04 in Part Two, Chapter Ten. 14. Regardie strongly advocated the idea of self-initiation, particularly in those cases where it was not possible to find a local temple of duly qualified initia- tors. 15. The eastern chakra system is fully described in Part Two, Chapter Eight. 16. According to Golden Dawn tradition, the highest must always be invoked first-the highest divine name, followed by archangels, angels, and finally ele- mental rulers and spirits. (In principle hs can be compared to a military chain of command. If you want something to get done, you must contact the hghest ranking officer, who then delegates the work down to officers of lower rank.) 17. Some Middle Pillar healing techmques are given in Part Two, Chapter Ten. 18. Regardie was both a chiropractor and a Reicluan therapist. Deep massage is an important part of Reicl-uan therapy, designed to break down rigid muscu- lar tension (armoring) that affects both body and psyche. Chropractic medi- cine uses the manipulation of the spine to relieve physical pain. It is easy to see how one system can be used to complement the other."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE CIRCULATING THE LIGHT AND THE FORMULA OF VIBRATION T he formula of the Middle Pillar has many and varied uses. It serves as an excellent prelude to any type of spiritual work. For those whose penchant or principal interest is the art of meditation as the supreme means of placing themselves in align- ment with the higher self, no better opening to that meditation could be found. It also serves, as suggested above, as the only worth-while preparation for serious magical work. It is that tech- nique which generates the magical power which by its presence spells success in the routine of ceremonial or ritual magic. Those who have not applied themselves to this practice-or have not stumbled upon its essential core by accident, as very often hap- pens-are certainly not those who have in any way proved the effi- cacy of the art of ceremonial. They believe that the ultimate factor which confers success is any one of a thousand things save tlus par- ticular preliminary one. We read in some authoritative tomes that the factor in question is the whirling dance, or music played by vio- lin or harp, the mystical circumambulation or the mental spasm sometimes caused by invocation or adoration. In practice, however, should any of these routines succeed in producing the requisite and longed for result, it is, as it were, in spite of themselves. That is to say, they are purely secondary and subordinate techniques. Their"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"method is hit or miss, and does not rest upon a sound basis of attainment nor upon a sure understanding of magical principles. The practice of the Middle Pillar is the introductory or preparatory means of aligning the personality with the inner self, of identifying and unifying all the levels of the true consciousness which we, in our complacency and blindness, choose to call the unconscious. Reverting back to the technical side of things, there is yet another development of the Middle Pillar which requires descrip- tion. Having been awakened from latency into some degree of activity, it is necessary that the power that the centers generate should be circulated through the invisible or psychic system. Fail- ure to do this is, in my estimation, one of the most potent sources of nervous trouble and disturbance experienced by dabblers in occultism, who have experimented with various amateur or incompletely delineated methods of awakening the psychic cen- ters. The energy thus awakened streams back and forth from the center. But unless some method is devised for distributing it and thus relieving the pressure, the center itself will in the course of time suffer derangement through over-stimulus, and there is bound to ensue some serious disturbance to the nervous and psy- chic system. Nervous breakdowns have been common-place amongst those who have unwisely attempted these things on insufficient knowledge, and neuroses have reaped a timely and bounteous harvest among students of the occult. With every one of the five centers active and throwing power into the mind and body, and there is a clear awareness of an actual column extending interiorly from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet, an entirely different technique must now be pur- sued. The student should return to the contemplation of his Kether, the lamp of invisible light above the head. Imagining this center still to be in a state of radiation, let him will that its energy circu- lates through the system in this wise. It descends from the head towards the left shoulder. Passing through the entire length of the left side of the body, the magnetic current strikes the sole of the left foot. Thence it passes over to the right sole,l upwards through the leg and thigh and body to the right shoulder, eventually returning to Kether."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Circulating the Light and the Formula of Vibration 87 Possibly this may sound fantastic to some readers. Impossible and incredible to others. But the fact remains that it can be done and simply too. It requires, above all, to be attempted in the spirit of honest investigation and tried again and again until the current of energy responds to the firm command of the will, thus following the course directed. Once clearly commanded, the current flows in that direction quite automatically and on its own momentum. The mind, naturally, must be calm and concentrated, not prone to wan- der off into pleasant excursions on the day's events. In this way, a great deal of the power generated is circulated through every particle of the body, so that each of these cells feels alive as never it has felt before. This, be it remembered, quite apart from the enhancement of the general field of consciousness. What I have described may be called for clarity's sake the formula of Circulation Number One. It is now necessary to circulate the stream of power in yet another direction. The object is to ensure that no single area of the sphere of sensation be omitted from its vitalizing and cleansing pas- sage. Once again returning to the vision of the light above the head, ths time imagine and will that the current of spiritual power descends from Kether in a forward direction. That is to say it passes downward in front of the face, descending through that region along the neck and chest, down the thghs to the feet. When it strikes the thghs, the stream turns backward along the soles of the feet, along the calves at the back, ascending the spinal column and neck until, once more, it reaches Kether. Both tlus formula and the preceding one should be repeated several times, until they become quite simple. The process should be accompanied by the rhythc breath, so that the descending current coincides with the exhalation of breath, while the ascending current accompanies the inhalation. It is really very easy, and it is only the description of it whch sounds involved and complex. Th~s formula we will call Circulation Number Two. The tlurd formula of circulation is rather different. The two pre- ceding methods will be discovered to have produced wheels of power spinning around the periphery of the aura or sphere of sensa- tion at right angles, as it were. The thrd formula is more akin to the motion of a spiral. Having returned on each of the former occasions"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of circulation to the contemplation of Kether, imagine the upright col- umn of brilliance, corresponding to the Middle Pillar, formulated through the center of the body. Pass now to the visualization of Malkuth emanating its inherent power of stability and equilibrium and fertility. Perhaps the easiest way to conceive of the motion of the thrd formula is to imagine the act of swathing or bandaging a leg. You wrap the gauze tightly around the lower part of the limb, grad- ually ascending the leg in closely wound spirals. This, simply, is the techruque of the formula under consideration. You should imagine a ray of power coming out from the right side of Malkutlz, moving over to the left foot. Here it descends under the legs, and comes up on the right a little higher up the spiral. Repeat the same movement again and again, until eventually you feel the distinct sensation of a wkurling of spiritual power whch gradually rises from the feet to the thighs, its spiral-current still fairly close and connected, over-lapping. those immediately below. From the thighs, the whirling or spiral proceeds up the trunk tightly enwrapping or enswathng it with a bandage of pure white light. Ths continues, until once more the cur- rent returns to rest in Kether. Ths completes the formulae of circum- ambulation, as the method is sometimes called.2 These circulatory movements will be referred to again later, and the student is asked to pay special attention to them. The Chinese yoga instruction, The Secret of tlze Golden Flower,3 has a sentence or two which is very apposite to this technique of the mystical circumambulations: Therefore when the Light circulates, the powers of the whole body arrange themselves before its throne, just as when a holy king has taken possession of the capital and has laid down the fundamental rules of order, all the states approach with tribute.. . . Therefore you only have to make the Light circulate; that is the deepest and most wonderful secret. The Light is easy fo move, but dificult to ,fix. If it is allowed to go long enough in a circle, then it crystallises itself; that is the natural spirit- body. This crystallized spirit is formed beyond the nine Heavens. It is the condition of which it is said in the Book of the Seal of the Heart: silently in the morning thou fliest upward. To summarize the practice, the Middle Pillar consists of several phrases. There is the preliminary establishment of a rhythmical intake and exhalation of breath. The formulation of the five centers"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Circulating the Light and the Formula of Vibration 8 89 on the Middle Pillar, each one separately. And finally, the several formulae for the distribution of the power thus generated. As one becomes more and more familiar with this process with the passage of time, the practice being continued daily, little artistic flourishes as it were may be introduced to enhance its efficiency and assist the process of interior development. Some caution, naturally, is needed. Common sense is essential. The student does not wish to generate or open himself to more power than easily he can accom- modate. This would prove, if not dangerous, then quite useless. For one thing, it would impede his own development and progress. The additions referred to are the colors of each center to be visualized whilst vibrating the name. This notably changes and stimulates the reaction of the Sephirah. Care is needed, and that is why it is recommended that for months the student should not apply himself to this color scheme, contenting himself exclusively with the visualization of the light-centers as white in color. Kether is of pure white brilliance, and the rays that it emits and radiates upon the personality are of the same hue. Lavender-blue is the color that is traditionally associated with Daath. Tiphareth is gold, whilst Yesod is purple or puce. It is when we approach the consideration of the Malkuth color that we experience some difficulty. Tradition gives us several scales of color all of which are of equal efficacy. The sphere of Malkuth is divided by two diagonals into four sections; citrine at the top, black at the bottom, with russet and olive occupying the two side sec- tions.4 More simply, it is sometimes useful to visualize this Sephi- rah solely as a jet black sphere, or yet again as of a dark green color. The student must suit himself here, finding out by practice which visualization produces the best results. When he has pursued such a practice for many months, let him extend the scope of his efforts to the formulation not only of the Middle Pillar, but the Sephiroth of the two side columns as well. By doing this, he formulates within the Sphere of Sensation the three pillars of the complete Tree of Life.5 The techmque and the proce- dure to be followed is precisely that delineated with regard to the Sephiroth of the Middle Pillar. The only gap in the student's"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"knowledge are the divine names of the Sephiroth of the two side pillars, and these I give below together with the appropriate colors. When there is much time at the student's disposal, and when he has won sufficient confidence in his ability, an additional aid is to employ the archangelic names in addition to the divine names with the several centers. For example, when visualizing Tiphareth as a glowing golden sphere, he will slowly vibrate three or four times the Name Yhvh Aloah ve-Daath.6 Then he will pause while concen- trating on the sphere. He will connive to realize in full conscious- ness the implications of this sphere-its attributions with regard to astrological planets, its spiritual qualities, and its relation to his own divine consciousness. This meditation performed, let him commence to vibrate in the same way and the same number of times the archangelic name of Raphael, again extending the medita- tion to realize that the latter name means divine healing. It implies that light which descends with \"healing in its wings.\"7 And so on for the remaining centers. Below are the names attributed to each Sephirah of the Tree of Life, their archangels, the appropriate region of the body in which they are to be visualized, and the color of the visualization: 1.

This is because the sphere is, in reality, no part of the traditional Tree of Life. The latter consists of ten spheres only and it was with these ten spheres that the ancients occupied them- selves and provided the necessary correspondences. The philosophy"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Circulating the Light and the Formula of Vibration 91 appertaining to Daath is almost entirely a modem one. But there is another mediaeval system which, attached to ths Qabalistic system, provides us with an invocation of the element spirit. A great deal of research on this was done by Dr. John Dee and his skryer Edward Kelly, both of whom called it the Angelic or Enochan system. My experience confirms that the archangelic names contained in one of these very potent magical invocations are very sympathetic to the nature of Daath, which is described as a link between the ego and the hgher self. These names may very logically be attributed to Daath and be used with it. They are Elexarpeh, Comananu, and Tabitom.25 The method of vibrating these archangelic names is to split each one into syllables, each one receiving the maximum amount of vibration. Let care be taken so that the vibration detonates solely in Daath. The Middle Pillar as already described, together with the for- mulae of circulation, constitutes the first half of this particular for- mula. The other half is denominated The Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar. To perform it properly presupposes a great deal of familiarity with the results to be obtained from the Middle Pillar and the complete Tree of Life exercise. It, however, proceeds a stage further. The former exercise devoted itself solely to awakening the centers considered as psycho-physical symbols or co-relatives of various principles operating with the psyche. The Vibratory Formula, so called, envisages another goal. Its object, once the interior Sephoth have been established and some awareness obtained of the principles they represent, is to ally or con- nect up those psychological principles to their replicas in the collec- tive unconscious.26 The traditional magical theory is that since man is a reproduction in miniature of the universe, hs own interior consti- tution must be modeled on the pattern of the larger universe of the collective unconscious. Just as the individual unconscious is not, as we have seen, a simple unit but comprises several constituents, so also the collective unconscious. Moreover, the tradition holds that by awakening any principle with or by becoming conscious of any factor operative within the psyche, it is possible by an extension of the sphere of its operation to tap the corresponding aspect of that cen- ter or psyche in the collective sphere. The deeper levels of the collec- tive unconscious bear to the individual unconscious the same"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"relationship as do the deepest levels of the latter to the conscious tlunking ego. That is, they comprise the root and hidden sources of life, integrity and illumination. It is the equilibriated realization of these sources of life whch make the difference between the enlight- ened man and the ignorant one. And these roots are the sources of life upon which the whole of existence in all its aspects depends. Since magic has as its avowed intention the discovery of the hgher self, and then to associate that higher self with the rest of the spiritual nature in a mood of co-operation, one way of accomplishing ths co-operation is to connect deliberately the levels of the individual unconscious with the different planes of the collective unconscious. The result of the acceptance of the existence of the personal uncon- scious acts as a solvent of the habitual resistances to its free operation. Therefore, co-operation with that part of nature, the higher self, is the implication of that acceptance. Likewise the acceptance of the collec- tive unconscious in the manner described, with the realization that the whole of life is an indissoluble unity accordingly raises that con- scious co-operation to a hgher and much more deliberate level. It removes evolution from the purely personal alignment with nature, to a realization of the divine object of individual existence. With it comes the intuition in full consciousness how best that object may be fulfilled in relation to all other men and to life as a whole. If I describe its techmque, some understanding perhaps of its purposes may be divined. It presupposes, as said, some familiarity with the Middle Pillar. It demands, moreover, that the Middle Pil- lar should be in active formulation as an interior column of bril- liance at the particular moment when the Vibratory Formula is to be employed. The student, then, begins to visualize in the atmos- phere before him the name of that particular Sephirah which rep- resents the level of consciousness he proposes to deal with.27 I must here interpolate that traditionally the letters of the Hebrew alphabet were employed for the purposes of this visualiza- tion. But I see no reason why the ordinary person should be obliged to burden himself with the necessity of studying Hebrew for this purpose. In the case of the serious student who wishes to make a profound study of the Qabalah from a purely magical point of view, and wishes to engage in the full ceremonial and ritual aspects of this"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Circulating the Light and the Formula of Vibration 93 tradition, I should be the first to insist that Hebrew be made a part of his curriculum. It would enter into every department of magic, in its wider implication, that he would touch. For the average student, however, English or Roman letters may be just as well employed. And I recommend that in the visualization only the consonants cor- responding to the appropriate Hebrew characters of a name be employed, not the vowels. That is why in the rubric of the Penta- gram Ritual, and in the table of correspondences above, I have spelt the divine names in consonantal form only28 The pronunciation of them is provided elsewhere. The name visualized in Roman letters in the air, let the student imagine that he has drawn these letters into the lungs by means of a deep inspiration of air. The names should be visualized in flames; in flames corresponding in color to the Sephirah being employed. That is to say, if it be the fifth Sephirah, the name should be visual- ized in scarlet and vivid red flame. But if the seventh Sephirah is being considered, the name ought to be formulated as in an emer- ald green of surpassing brilliance and clarity. The name having been inhaled into the lungs by means of an inspiration, it should be silently and powerfully vibrated, the entire attention being concentrated upon this to the exclusion of all else. While in the lungs, the whte light of the Kether ought to be felt descending upon the name, consecrating it to the service of the higher self. Then the name should be visualized, whilst the breath is retained, as descending from the lungs via the Middle Pillar to the feet.29 Here it should be again vibrated very powerfully. When the entire Tree of Life within is pulsating sympathetically to this vibration, the name rises rapidly once more to the lungs where once more it is subjected to a silent vibration. The exhalation of the breath accompanies an audible vibration of the name. It also accompanies a gesture to be made which consists of two movements. The first is the placing of the left foot about six to twelve inches forward. The second is the raising of both hands to the side of the head, on a level with the eyes, and then flinging them for- ward as though to project a force emanating from within. As the arms are flung forward, the exhalation and powerful vibration aloud of the name takes place. This gesture is called the Projecting Sign."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The visualized name should be perceived as going forward in space until it strikes as it were against the confines of the universe. Here it gathers power, from the infinity of the void, as it were, whence it commences to surge backwards in the mind's eye upon the student. Some seconds after the projection and audible vibration of the name the student should bring his left foot sharply back, and after dropping both hands to the side, raise the forefinger of the left hand to hs lips. This is called the Protecting Sign, or sign of silence. It is the traditional gesture of the Egyptian god Harpocrates-one of the symbols employed to represent the holy child that grew from the union of the two opposites. It thus represents the growth, silent and unseen, of the Golden Flower. Whilst employing the sign of silence, the student should contrive to imagine that the name which has been projected by the first sign to the outer limits of space, surges back upon him, penetrating him through and through. His whole being should be flooded with a divine light, and a sense of ecstasy should overwhelm the mind and vision. Standing quietly in this sign, the practitioner should meditate upon the spiritual value involved in the nature of the name he has used. There should dawn upon his mind by direct perception an understanding and a wide sympathy with that spiritual power to which he has opened himself and which now flows unimpeded through him. It is often accompanied at first by a complete blank- out of every faculty of the mind, so that for at least some seconds one is lost utterly to oneself. It seems that in that brief moment we are swung forcibly across the gulf of the abyss into another and diviner region by the vibratory momentum of the power of the name. It is a distinct recognition of, and participation in, that type of experience whch has variously been called mystical and religious. It is a rare and holy event for the individual ceases, it may be for but a single instant of time, to be a man. He is caught up in a diviner sphere, and is enwrapped by the transcendental folds of the descending tongues of the spirit. For but a moment or two only- for the very nature of consciousness, with its feeble instrument the brain, is such as to be unable to endure for very long this whte heat of ecstacy. And then once more the ego, dazed and stunned by so awe-inspiring and terrific an experience, recovers its equilibrium,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Circulating the Light and the Formula of Vibration 95 resumes its normal function, and asserts itself once more. But the nature of that consciousness is never the same afterwards. It has changed in that an impression of higher things is left, a sense of exaltation and of expansion. It dimly understands that godhead has descended into its sphere, and that it has been raised into divinity. It must be understood that ths technique is applicable to any of the names belonging to the ten Sephiroth. And moreover, it must also be clearly understood that the vibration should be repeated several times as described, and that the three formulae of circum- ambulation or circulation must be employed with this Vibratory formula as they were with the Middle Pillar. One authority on magic describes the effect thus: If is a sign fhaf the student is performing this correctly when a single vibration entirely exhausts his physical strength. It should cause him to grow hot all over or to perspire violently, and if should so weaken him fhaf he willfind if di$cult to remain standing, If is a sign of success, though only by the student himseyis if perceived, when he hears the Name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if by the concourse of ten thousand fhun- dm; and it should appear to him as iffhat Great Voice proceededfrom the Universe and notfrom him. In the above practice all consciousness of any- thing but the God-Name should be absolutely blotted out; and the longer if fakes his normal perception to return, the better.30 My own personal experience of this formula whle confirmatory is not quite so drastic as the above description would make out. Two or three little hts may be given to the student which may be helpful. The first of these, is with regard to breath-capacity. Shallow breathing renders the Vibratory Formula null and void, or at any rate of little value. It seems to confirm the yoga theory of a certain relationshp existing between the breath and consciousness. The western system as such does not countenance or employ the yoga theory whereby the rate of breath is slowed down in order to restrain the motion of the mind. But from the physical point of view, whch is valid in its own sphere, those lungs whch are capable of filling to their fullest capac- ity, and are capable of retaining the breath for over thirty seconds, are more likely to be useful for ths formula than weak and puny lungs. Another important point is that the experiment should be per- formed in as nearly an empty room as possible. Or, where this is not practicable, all heavy furniture should be cleared as far from"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"where the student stands as is compatible with the size and arrangement of the room. The reason for this is simple. The sharp pang of ecstasy, the dizziness induced by full inhalation and pro- longed retention, and the enormous power which this Vibratory Formula generates are so tremendous that until the student accus- toms himself to it by frequent repetition, he may find himself inca- pacitated for a second or two. The perspiration by the way induced by this practice is a peculiar one, being very similar in consistency and odor to that generated by Pranayama31 of the Yoga system. The incapacity experienced is such that he may, while lost to hmself, stumble forward and fall. If, during the practice, the fall is to be encouraged, then it is as well that it should be on to a carpet or something soft. It would spoil the effect of the practice were the student to break up the induced state of consciousness by casting his eye about anxiously and with fear in order to avoid doing him- self a physical injury by htting some piece of furniture. When the practice however has been repeated some dozen times or so, the entire psychic and physical system becomes accustomed to the severe strain imposed upon it without manifesting any sign of weakness. The student will find himself enabled to make the Sign of Silence without falling or stumbling, even though the surge of power within him may feel unbearable, and the ravishment of ecstasy too intolerable to stand. But \"Wisdom says be strong. Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture.\"32 Repetition and becoming accustomed to the mental and spiri- tual phenomena induced by the formula makes the ecstasy more bearable and enables one to become strong in that spiritual joy and capable of resisting the physical symptoms of weakness. There are innumerable other techniques which are included under the comprehensive term magic: divination, clairvoyance, astral projection, godforms, and many others. The only matter requiring some few words here is that of ceremonial. But the prin- ciples underlying this are so simple that the student who has understood the psychological principles laid down earlier in the book will have no difficulty in understanding its function. The pur- pose of ceremonial is that of all magic-the awakening of the inte- rior man, the aligning it with the consciousness and powers of the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Circulating the Light and the Formula of Vibration 97 universe about him. Its method, though, seems to the novice slightly different from the others. Actually, however, its procedure is identical with the other techniques, except that it brings them down to the physical plane. That is to say, instead of performing a series of purely introverted exercises, ceremonial magic devotes itself to enacting on the physical plane a series of psychic events. That is to say, it combines, according to its own principles, the ben- efits of introversion with those of the extraverted temperament. We have seen that the ten Sephiroth represent different princi- ples in man. The former chapters have described various methods of dealing with these constituents and with bringing them into opera- tion. Ceremonial magic would apply itself to this problem of the manifestation of interior psychological principles in this way. It would take a room or temple, and so arrange it as to represent either the Tree of Life as a whole, or some particular aspect of a portion of it. The phlosophy of the diagrammatic Tree is explained in various Qabalistic works, and an understanding of that would determine the arrangement employed. Certain stations would be set up in the tem- ple, with officers placed there to represent the activity and operation of a certain Sephirah. Thus a ceremony, if it has been arranged by individuals who were thoroughly conversant with magical princi- ples and with the basic principles of the Tree of Life, would be a cel- ebration in dramatic form of the powers of these ten Sephroth.33 The celebration of it physically, with each officer aware of the Sephirah represented and knowing how to bring the power of that Sephirah into operation either by the Vibratory Formula or by the assumption of the traditional godform ascribed to that Sephrah, will have made available an enormous amount of power. The penetration of this spiritual force into the sphere of sensation, and its reaction upon the consciousness of all present, is likely to produce a result in con- sciousness similar to, but much more concentrated and powerful than, the effects of the magical methods above described. Little more need be said, but each student can work out the idea more completely. A great deal more material on the subject of ceremonial magic may be found in my Tree of Life and The Golden Dawn. But for the moment, my remarks may be limited to the above. And I must again emphasize what has been reiterated"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"through the entire length of these pages. Ceremonial magic will avail the student nothing, and be of no practical use to him at all, until he has applied himself with great sincerity and application to the sim- pler practices delineated above. The Pentagram Ritual, the Qabalis- tic Cross and the Middle Pillar comprise the simple steps to spiritual development. It is only when these steps have been taken, and skill in their performance achieved, that he may feel it right and proper to approach that great edifice of ceremonial magic which is like a lad- der, the bottom rung of mhch is rooted upon the earth so that all may climb quite easily. Its heights, however, are lost in the clouds of spiritual attainment where none may go until he has accomplished all that is possible here and now, and until he has integrated himself through and through. As has so often been stated here, I consider that analytical psychology must be regarded as the first part of that onward journey to the heights at the end of the distant plains. Not until the mind and the emotional system have been cleansed and urufied by the cathartic process of psycho-therapy, can the full spiri- tual benefits of magical work be reflected into the mind of man.

According to Forrest, the original Archangel of Mars was Samuel-a name that MacGregor Mathers changed to Zarnael in order to avoid confusion with the Qliphotic Samael. When the Qabalists began to assign Archangels to the Sephiroth, someone attributed a list of Planetary Archangels to their corresponding Sephroth, and the martial Samael was naturally assigned to Geburah. At some point ths list was copied into Greek. In late Greek writing, the letter Sigma (the first letter in Samael) came to be drawn in the shape of a \"C.\" Still later, when the Greek list was copied into Latin, the copyist made the error of transliterating the Greek name of CAMAHL as Camael rather than Samael. Even later, someone (perhaps a member of the Golden Dawn) back-transliterated Camael as 5~~3 and thus was Camael (or Khamael) born. And although it originated as an error in translation, it does help magicians distinguish between Samael, Archangel of Evil, Zamael, Archangel of Mars, and Khamael, Archangel of Geburah. 18.

The one is incomplete without the other. In fact, a large percentage of ancient magical knowledge is being rediscovered and renamed by today's psychologists for modern times. Regardie considered self-knowledge and self-accep- tance gained through analytical psychology as important preludes to the divine self-knowledge and spiritual realization attained through magic. When The Middle Pillar was first written, few espoused these ideas. Today, however, a growing number of psy- chologists are coming boldly within reach of embracing them. And many magicians are already using the jargon that psychologists considered germane to their profession only. Today civilization looks to science to solve the major problems of humanity. In the early days when psychology was a young sci- ence, its disciples thought they were entering a time of a new renaissance when their efforts would provide \"joy, zest, and rich- ness of life\" to fellow human beings-when the mental health of the average citizen would steadily improve.

Psychology and spirituality should not be separate entities. It is time to tear down the artificial walls that divide them.

One of psy- chology's founding fathers, Carl Gustav Jung, was aware of this even if some of today's psychotherapists have forgotten it-a sign hanging above Jung's office door read: Avocatus Atque Non-Avocatus Deus Aderit (\"whether or not he is called, God will be presentU).5 Since the goal of both magic and psychotherapy is the well-being of the indi- vidual, it is only natural they become re-acquainted with one another. Contemporary psychology must transform itself to include a more holistic approach wherein the physical, psychological, and transper- sonal aspects of the individual are all seen as interconnected, and humanity's need for healing, spirituality, and guidance is respected. If psychology can be compared to a diction+ of words in a specific language (the human psyche), magic can be compared to a book of poetry that makes those words come alive with meaning and relevance in our lives (psychological/ spiritual evolution). Now that we have reprimanded modern psychology for its shortcomings, we can explore some of the monumental contribu- tions it has made to the understanding of the human mind. From there we will explore how psychotherapy and magic can come together to the meaningful enrichment of both and, more impor- tantly, for the benefit and welfare of the individual. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is the treatment of mental disorders with methods that revolve around the interpersonal relationshp between therapist and client. A large portion of ths entails helping clients explore their own ideas about themselves. The earliest form of psychotherapy, called psychoanalysis, began with Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Freud discovered that the corporeal symptoms of patients suffering from hysteria often disappeared after seemingly forgotten material was brought into the realm of consciousness. From th~s Freud conjectured one of the most fundamental theories of modern psychology-that within the human psyche there exists a powerful segment known as the unconscious which influences all of"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"106 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC our actions, yet functions with material or content that cannot be recalled or remembered by normal processes. He regarded the unconscious as a extensive portion of the mind that housed instinc- tual drives and the forgotten residue of unwanted life experiences or thoughts. Freud named this \"forgetting\" (or the prevention of unde- sired ideas from entering the conscious mind) repression. Repression is one of a number of defense mechanisms:6 unconscious reactions employed to satisfy emotional needs, balance opposing objectives, decrease anxiety resulting from unwanted thoughts, or change real- ity to make it more bearable. The cornerstone of Freud's psychoana- lytic therapy was the conscious recollection or recognition of repressed memories and experiences. The basic tools of hs therapy were free association7 and dream interpretation. In recent years other forms of psychotherapy, including behav- ior therapy, hypnotherapy, and group therapy, have become pop- ular. In many cases psychotherapy is not only employed for the treatment of mental disorders, but for less severe problems. Ther- apists often assist people in breaking unwanted or compulsive habits (smoking, overeating, etc.). Freud's Triad of the Psyche Freud developed the theory that the conscious mind is only a small part of our mental composition, and our motivations are caused, for the most part, by factors that we are unaware of. Freud postulated that psyche is divided into three distinct factions: the id, the ego and the super-ego. According to Freud, the id is the division of the psyche that is completely unconscious and functions as the origin of instinc- tual impulses and demands for instant satisfaction of primal needs. It is the reservoir of unconscious drives, ruled by the pleasure prin- ciple and instant gratification. The ego is that portion of the psyche whch is conscious, most directly governs thought and behavior, and is most concerned with outer reality. The ego mediates between the id, the super-ego, and the stipulations of reality or society. The super- ego, primarily unconscious, is that which is created by the internal- ization of moral standards from parents and society-it is the conscience and the ego ideal-a moralizing faculty which monitors"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 107 and censors the ego. Because of society, parental guidance, and peer pressure, humans experience a process of repression from the day of birth. Thus the id and the super-ego are usually in conflict in most people, since as Freud thought, repression was necessary in order for humanity to live within the bounds of civilization. Human beings, according to Freud, are motivated by vital ani- mal instincts-primarily the sexual drive which he called the libido. Other principal elements of psychology uncovered by Freud were the ideas of the Oedipus complex and infantile sexuality.8 Freud's tools for exploring the human psyche included hypno- sis, dream analysis, and a new techtuque that he termed \"free asso- ciation.\" The goal of Freudian analysis was to release repressed memories and provide an increase in self-knowledge that would release trapped energies and result in a more satisfying existence for the patient. Jung and Spiritual Psychology The works of Swiss psychologist C. G. Jung (1875-1961) can be seen as part of the apex of the occult revival of the late nineteenth century. Using the new vocabulary employed by Sigmund Freud, Jung described that knowledge of the human psyche which mys- tics and magicians had gathered since ancient times. What had once been veiled in occult jargon and symbolism, and thus viewed as superstition and nonsense by the public at large, was now for the first time expressed in such a manner that psychologists and other intellectuals sat up and took notice. Jung's exploration of psychology in conjunction with hs study of the paranormal made his theories the crucial link between psychology and magic. How- ever, hs interest in occult matters was one of the primary reasons for hs ultimate break with Freud. The difference between Freud's and Jung's approaches to psy- chology was primarily Jung's view that the human psyche was a whole organism and Freud's belief that it was not. Freud extrapo- lated a rather disorderly picture of the psyche wherein autonomous components of the mind battled for dominance. Jung saw the psyche as being complete in itself from birth, the various elements of the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"I I psyche attempted to work harmoniously together, and their natural I I inclination was toward unity.

In I I addition, Freud was more concerned with his patient's past, while I I Jung emphasized the patient's future development. I I I Whereas Freud referred to his method as psychoanalysis, Jung I I preferred the phrase analytical psychology. Heilsweg The psychology which Jung very gradually developed was described by him as Heilsweg, a German word which meant \"sacred way\" and a \"method of healing.\" Jung's idea of the psy- che was based on a separation between the conscious and the unconscious-the personal unconscious being a small tributary of the greater river of the collective unconscious. The pilgrimage of the \"self' symbolized the bringing of unconscious content into the light of consciousness. Heilsweg was a method for differentiating the self from the collective unconscious that was the blueprint of individual existence. It was a way of individuation or the process by whch a person becomes self-realized-a separate indivisible unity or \"whole\" whch contains all aspects of the self. This was a radical departure from Freud's view that people are enslaved to the drives of the id and super-ego which pressure them into conforming with society-sanctioned patterns of behavior. According to Jung, the ego's formation of an identity was not only the beginning of true \"personhood\" but also the commencement of a natural polarity between the general and the specific. Several stages marked the process of Heilsweg or individua- tion. The first stage was the confrontation with the shadow-those unconscious aspects of the self which have been buried or ignored by the conscious mind. Ths begins with the dissolution of the false self, the mask, or the outer persona. The persona is a complicated system of relations between individual con- sciousness and society,fittingly enough a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and, on the other, to conceal the true nature of the individual.9"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 109 Next, the individual encounters his \"soul image,\" the anima or the animus. The final step is the manifestation in dreams, visions, or fantasies of appropriate archetypes-primordial images such as the wise old man, or the Great Mother, images that appear as themes in religion, mythology, and folklore. The process of individuation contains many particular aspects which collectively might be termed \"outer psychology.\" Ths cate- gory includes Jung's separation of introverted and extroverted per- sonality types as well as his organization of types in accordance with their conjunction of the faculties of sensing, thnking, feeling, and intuition. All of Jung's ideas were of vital importance to modern under- standing of the human psyche. However, the most notable contri- bution of Jungian psychology was the concept that individuation was a spiritual excursion and it is hghly significant that ths pioneer of psychology phrased his ideas in spiritual terms. Thus it is no surprise to find that Jung's system complements the mystical Qabalah in so many ways. The Nature of the Psyche Jung's definition of the psyche included not only that whch we call the soul but also the intellect, the spirit, and the totality of all psy- chic processes. The psyche is as real as the body is real-all psychic phenomena are real, since the psyche is indistinguishable from its manifestations. The psyche expresses itself in images that are full of meaning and purpose-it creates reality every day. It has its own peculiar structure and form. For the psyche as it presents ifsey-as if is experienced by us-is insepa- rublefrom our physical being. But this by no means implies a biological 'dependency.' The psyche deserves to be taken as a phenomenon in its own right; there are no grounds at all for regarding if as a mere epiphenrnenon, dependent though it may be on fhef14nctioning of the brain. One would be as little jus fijied in regarding life as an epiphenomenon of the chemistry of carbon cornpounds.10 The psyche consists of many parts, but there are two primary divisions that are interrelated-consciousness and unconsciousness."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Unconsciousness The unconscious is not simply the absence of consciousness.

The personal unconscious is that unknown part of the individual human mind that is older than the conscious part of the mind. It is the primal portion from which consciousness arises. This unconscious (equivalent to Freud's super-ego) is unique to the indi- vidual, and it contains suppressed, forgotten, or subliminally per- ceived contents originating from a person's life. Whereas the mind can be trained, the unconscious cannot. It is a creative and autonomous psychc entity that is beyond subjective control. Jung concluded that the collective unconscious does not include personal characteristics distinctive to one's individual ego but rather the sum of what is Inherited from the biological and psychic structure common to the human race. They are those acts and men- tal patterns that are universally shared by all humanity. The pri- mordial images of the collective unconscious are the result of thousands of years of human struggle and experience. Every great experience in life, every profbund conflict, evokes the accu- mulated treasure of these images and brings about their inner constella- tion.

In the later event he actually lives the myth and the symbol without knowing it.ll Consciousness Consciousness is that component of waking awareness perceptible to a person at any given instant. It is a state of being mentally awake and observant, of having an awareness of one's environ- ment and one's own existence, sensations, and thoughts. Con- sciousness is therefore the function which sustains the relationship between psychc content and the ego.

In this manner, man would achieve the \"greater victory over himself\" (see Fig- ure 5, p. 112). The Shadow If the repressed tendencies, the shadow as I call them, were obviously evil, there would be no problem whatever. But the shadow is merely somewhat inferior, primitive, unadapted, and awkward; nof wholly bad. If even contains childish or primitive qualities which would in a way vitalize and embellish human existence.14 The shadow represents the sum of all personal and collective psychic elements which, due to their incompatibility with the selected conscious demeanor, are refused expression in life and consequently unite into a somewhat independent splinter person- ality (a type of alter-ego) whose unconscious inclinations run opposite those of the conscious. It is our \"dark brother\" who is a hidden but undeniable part of our total psyche. The development of the shadow coincides with that of the ego-aspects that the ego rejects are repressed and have little or no outlet in a person's con- scious life. The shadow often behaves to counterbalance the con- scious-whch can be positive or negative.15 Very much an archetypal figure, the shadow personality often appears symbolically in dreams as being the same sex as the dreamer. In addition, an individual will sometimes project his shadow, i.e., his own unwanted subconscious characteristics, onto another person. I In keeping with his views on the unconscious, Jung proposed that there are actually two forms of the shadow, the personal I shadow, composed of the individual's cast-off psychic content, and j i"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"ous Figure 5: Jung's Model of the Psyche."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 113 the collecfive shadow, which embodies all the collective repressed memories of humankind. Confronting the Shadow Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it. Furthermore, it is constantly in contact with other interests, so that it is continually subjected to mod$- cations. But if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness, it never gets corrected.16 Throughout our lives, we are constantly having to suppress one attribute or another. Thus the shadow can never completely be assimilated into consciousness. However, it is essential that the most conspicuous aspects of the shadow be raised to conscious- ness. Instead of rejecting the shadow, its counterpart, the ego will be invigorated by it. If the shadow is not reckoned with, it runs the risk of becoming a vast dark forgotten expanse which blocks one's inner creativity from being fully available to the conscious mind. This is why some people strive with Herculean strain to keep a tight lid on their shadows, concealing their private \"demons\" with a thin veneer of moral perfection. The spiritual fortress they construct around themselves is nothing more than a synthetic buttress held in place by force and ever in danger of structural failure should the wind change direction. \"Mere suppression of the shadow is as little of a remedy as beheading would be for a headache.\"l7 It is for ths reason that confronting the shadow is the first step in Jung's method of individuation. To do this means taking a starkly critical and objective look into the nature of one's own being. Uncon- scious content is usually experienced in projection upon something that is outside of us. In the case of unwanted psyhc content, some people will readily project their shadow onto someone else. Thus, we have a tendency to shft the blame onto an appropriate scapegoat- \"the other guy did it,\" or as a comedian once insisted, \"the Devil made me do it!\" It is extremely difficult for some analysands to accept the fact that they do indeed have a deep, dark side. The therapist,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"who tries to bring the shadow out into the open, often meets with enormous resistance because the client fears that the artificial struc- ture he has carefully constructed to protect hs ego will come crashing down. Ths is in fact the point at whch many analyses fail and the client, incapable of facing his unconscious self, stops the process cold and withdraws into his comfortable old self-deceptions. All of us must face our shadow side. This is especially impor- tant for magicians who seek to delve into the inner recesses of the human psyche-the mind of the microcosm. No spiritual progress can be made without it. We must discover the distinct characteris- tics of our shadow (as opposed to other parts of the psyche such as the ego), and recognize it for what it is-a natural part of ourselves and nothg to be ashamed of or feel guilty about. Guilt and shame often cause one to repress the shadow in the first place, allowing a small undesirable trait to grow into a huge unresolved conflict, compulsion, or neurosis. In some ways, the shadow is like a neglected and resentful child who, if shown kindness and under- standing, can learn to play with the other children. Objective understanding of ourselves will make it easier to face the shadow and other parts of the psyche as well. REGRESSION EXERCISE Examining the events of one's childhood is a prerequisite for deter- mining how the shadow developed. An excellent method for recall- ing clruldhood memories is the following Regression Exercise:ls Perform the LBRP. Perform the four-fold breath. (Breathe in the count of four. Hold the breath to the count of four. Exhale to the count of four. Keep the lungs empty to the count of four.) Sit in a comfortable position or lie down, eyes closed. Spend a few minutes inducing relaxation and rhythc breathing. Visualize yourself withn your present surroundings. As you continue the four-fold breath, see yourself going back- wards in time. As you inhale to the count of four, thmk of last spring. Hold the breath for four counts and think of last winter. Exhale to the count of four and imagine last fall. On the empty hold to the count of"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 115 four, thrnk of last summer. Continue the exercise in hs fashion going backwards into time, from spring to winter, fall, and summer, ever backwards, keeping pace with the four-fold breath. You may decide to go back in time in five-year intervals: five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years, etc. At any one of these intervals, stop and visualize yourself at that particular point in time. Observe how you looked, how your surroundings looked, the people around you at that time, how you felt about yourself, and how you saw your world. Examine significant events that occurred wluch shaped your view of the world and of yourself. When ready to end the exercise, use the four-fold breath to visualize time moving forward again. (Inhale-spring, full hold- summer, exhale-fall, empty hold-winter.) Move time forward again until you arrive at the present. End the exercise with the LBRP. Always record your observations. You should practice tlus exercise several times, deciding before- hand what time in the past you wish to examine further. If you become quite proficient in this technique, you can go back one year at a time, all the way back to birth. TRAUMA RELEASE EXERCISE Sometimes traumatic experiences or memories are responsible for creating parts of the shadow personality. In such cases, a trauma release exercise can help the analysand \"let go\" of the calamitous experience and begin to heal. The techmque for this is as follows: Have the person lie on their back. Place your right hand on their forehead, and your left hand at the back of their head. (A breathg techmque to further relaxation is helpful at this point.) Next, guide the person to slowly visualize the traumatic event in the reverse order it happened, to a time before it occurred. In other words, emphasize that the details of the event will look like a video tape running in reverse and in slow motion."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"116 THE BALANCE BETWEEN WND AND MAGIC Then have the person run this mental tape in its natural order, forward in time, until arriving at the initial point when the event began. Guide the person to repeat ths backward and forward motion until they no longer feel an emotional connection to the event. At the close of the session, have the person take a long deep breath as they reflect upon any stress or concerns, hold the breath for a few seconds, and then release it, letting go of any residual ten- sions. Repeat this three times. (It is usually recommended that the person do this exercise a number of times on their own over a period of a few weeks to be cer- tain that it is effective. It can also be done entirely solo if preferred.) Anima and Animus The second step in the process of individuation is defined by the encounter with the animus or the anima. The anima is the embodi- ment of the reflective feminine nature of man's subconscious, while the animus is the personification of the creative masculine nature of a woman's subconscious. Both are \"soul images\" whch usually man- ifest themselves in anthropomorphic form as \"fantasy lovers\" in dream and imagination. Animus and anima have a direct relation- shp with the persona or mask-if the persona is emotional, the soul image is rational, and vice versa. They are two of the most important archetypes, often influencing how we respond to members of the opposite sex. People often search out, and are attracted to, someone who symbolizes the attributes of their own psyche. Every man carries within him the eternal image of woman, not the image of this or that particular woman, but a definitive feminine image. This image is findamentally unconscious, an hereditary factor of pri- mordial origin engraved in the living organic system of the man, an imprint or \"archetype\" of all the ancestral experiences of the female, a deposit, as it were, of all the impressions ever made by woman.. .. Since this image is unconscious, it is always unconsciously projected upon the person of the beloved, and is one of the chief reasons for passionate attrac- tion or aversion.l9"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 12 7 We must learn to discriminate between interior and exterior man- ifestation of the anima and animus, just as we must distinguish our- selves from our shadow. Whereas the conscious recognition of the shadow brings forth the knowledge of one's own dark side as it relates to a person's own sex, so does the recognition of the animus or anirna provide the means for understanding the contrasexual portion of the psyche. It is precisely this lack of discrimination that leads a person to repeatedly seek out a certain kind of mate-a \"bad boy\" or \"nasty girl\" type who will inevitably treat them poorly. Ths is exactly how some individuals, in failing to differentiate between their own soul image (and secret inner desires) and a prospective mate, project the inner image outward and consequently fall into bad relationshps time and time again. Sometimes the animus and anima can be sym- bolized by parental figures, leading some people to try to find a com- panion who resembles their father or mother in some way. Wle attempting to find \"the perfect mate,\" externalization of the soul image leads some to look outside of themselves for the perfection and beauty that lies with. Ths is true for most people who choose a mate who represents the subconscious portion of the psyche. And since no human mate can fit perfectly into the transferred image, after time the carrier of the projection displays his or her own character traits, resulting in frustration and discord in the relationship. If a per- son could only recognize the soul image within as a part of their own inner self, they would stop attributing their flaws to their mate and retract the projection. Any psyhc energy that has been bound up in the projection would be freed for other, more progressive pursuits. The encounter with the soul image usually takes place later in life, after the dynamics of youth, reproduction, and the priorities of the outer world have been satiated. Confronting the soul image is an indication that the second half of one's life has commenced. Once the contrasexual soul image has been brought to conscious- ness, however, it may not be possible to \"lose ourselves completely\" in the love of another, for we have now found the object of that love within us. Ths brings with it the realization that we are in fact com- plete with ourselves, and we do not need a slavish love to a pro- jected illusion in order to prop us up. Instead we are enabled to develop a deeper love and a conscious devotion to our partner."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The proper role of the soul image is that of the psychopomp, guiding the soul around impasses on its way toward spiritual transformation. It is the mediator between the conscious and the unconscious. Whereas the persona is the reconciler between the ego and the outer world, the soul image is the reconciler between the ego and inner world. Once fully realized and integrated, the soul image can bring incredible enrichment into consciousness and a vital expansion of the true self. Archetypes The third step in the process of individuation is the manifestation of archetypes. An archetype is an idea, mode of thought, or god- form that has manifested from the inherited experiences of humankind-from the collective unconscious. The concept of the archetype.. .is derived from the repeated observation that, for instance, the myths and faiytales of world literature contain definite motifs which crop up everywhere. We meet these same motifs in the fantasies, dreams, deliria, and delusions of individuals living today. These typical images and associations are what I call archetypal ideas. The more vivid they are, the more they will be coloured by particularly strong feeling-tones.. .They impress, influence, and fascinate us. They have their origin in the archetype, which in itseIf is an irrepresentable, unconscious, pre-existent form that seems to be part of the inherited structure of the psyche and can therefore manifest itself spontaneously anywhere, at any According to Jung, once the soul image has been integrated, next comes the manifestation of the major archetypes of spirit and matter. These include the \"wise old man\" as the spirit principle in man, and the \"great mother\" as the principle of matter (or nature) in woman. Here we are dealing with the primal roots of the psyche of either sex back to its origins, and the ancient god-forms from which they derive. Both the \"wise old man\" and the \"great mother\" can appear in a multitude of figures from all world mythologies. They are the sky gods, earth mothers, heroes, heroines, magicians, priests, priest- esses, prophetesses, harvest gods, and fertility goddesses of all pan- theons. These ancient archetypes are transcendent energies that can bring much wisdom and spiritual growth."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 119 Jung referred to archetypal figures of the psyche as \"manazl personalities.\" This is a particular archetype or group of archetypes that the individual psyche most strongly expresses or manifests. A person who has mana is said to have power and influence over others, but also runs the risk of becoming self-centered and mega- lomaniacal. This is because these great universal archetypes pro- duce a potent attraction whch can in some instances entice the individual into identifying him or herself with the archetype, cre- ating a type of self-aggrandizement or ego-inflation. Such is the path of many modern-day messiahs, self-appointed gurus, and power-mad spiritual leaders. An inf7ated consciousness is always egocentric and conscious of nothing but its own existence. It is incapable of learningfrom the past, incapable of understanding contemporary events, and incapable of drawing right conclusions aboutfuture. It is hypnotized by itseyand therefore cannot be argued with. It inevitably dooms itseyto calamities that must strike it dead.22 All of us surrender to such arrogance during ths process of individuation, however, the creative energies that are stimulated in the psyche by the appearance of archetypes can be fully accessed only after one has humbly acquired the ability to discern the differ- ence between hm or her self and them. On the road to self-growth, we must not mistake personal insights into our own inner workings as messages from God to his new chosen prophet. We must work to clarify our relationship to spirit and nature as represented by the godslarchetypes. These potent and eternal forces are a part our our psyche that are meant to empower and inspire us. Magicians regard archetypes as various forms or images of divinity that teach us about ourselves and our place in the divine universe. The conscious recognition of the psychic elements that comprise the mana person- ality archetype brings the first real sense of authentic individuality. Accessing Archetypes Although textbooks on psychology provide few examples of arche- types for the reader to explore, various textbooks on magic are often replete with such prototype figures. Many are readily found"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"120 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC in the cards of the tarot. Meditation on these images, as well as a host of tarot exercises that can be found in such books as Madonna Compton's Archetypes on the Tree of Life, Gareth Knight's Tarot and Magic, Paul Foster Case's Book of Tokens, or our own book The New Golden Dawn Ritual Tarot, can be used to identify and connect with various archetypes that inhabit the psyche. Several archetypes, in the form of gods and goddesses, are cor- related to the spheres on the Tree of Life, according to their nature and characteristics. War and fire gods are assigned to Geburah, god- desses of love and pleasure to Netzach, etc. A small selection of deities from several pantheons are listed in Chapter Ten. Meditation on these figures can aid in understanding the archetypal beings that one may encounter in the process toward true self-awareness. It is important that the student not fall into the trap of the psy- chologization of magic23 that is a result of misunderstanding Jung's theories. To the pop \"psycholo-occultist\" the archetypes, deities, and symbols are simply creations of the human mind-they have no existence beyond the individual human being. Pop psychology sometimes gives the impression that humans create, work with, and discard archetypes as easily as an old pair of shoes, in a kind of superficial mental role-playing game. Ths view does not do Jung's theory justice, since archetypes exist eternally and independently of any individual. To truly understand ths, one must be willing to accept the spiritual (magical) side of human existence-we are part of a cosmic ecosystem, so to speak. Self-Realization Throughout the process of individualization, unconscious content has been gradually raised into consciousness. Combined with the dissolution of the persona and the decrease in the sovereign power of the conscious mind, hs new awareness brings with it a state of psychc imbalance. Magicians refer to this time as \"the dark night of the soul.\" This intentionally created imbalance works to remove any mental impediments which stand in the way of further psychic growth. If the conscious mind is able to absorb and develop the psychc content emerging from the subconscious, then this state of"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 121 balance induces the independent, intuitive activity of the uncon- scious to create a new equilibrium and the result, as Jung put it, is \"the victory over the collective psyche.\" Then and only then is the median between the conscious and the unconscious to be found. This is the archetypal image of the self, and self-realization is the final step on the path of individuation. The emergence of the self is a transformation of the psyche which involves a whole new outlook toward life. Ths is no easy process. Primal impulses from the subconscious will still assail us, but no longer will we totally identify ourselves with them, or flee from them. We must do our best to understand them, and we should not let the resulting tension between the waking consciousness and the unconscious process disturb our daily routine in any way. Our ability to withstand this tension and persevere through a state of psychic imbalance is what will lead us to a new psycluc equipoise. Consciousness and unconsciousness complement each other to form the greater principle of the self. Not only is the self at the cen- ter of these two halves of the psyche, it is also the circumference which surrounds them. According to Jung, the only content of the self that we can know is the individuated ego. Endeavoring to know more, we run into the boundaries of our own knowledge. The self is transcendental. It can only be felt and experienced- never wholly understood by the rational mind. It 'is strange to us and yet so near, wholly ourselves and yet unknow- able, a virtual center of mysterious constitution.. . . The beginnings of our whole psychic life seem to be inextricably rooted in this point, and all our highest and ultimate purposes seem to be striving tozuard it. This paradox is unavoidable, as always when we try to define sorne- thing that lies beyond the bourn of our understanding.. ..I24 It is obvious that Jung is bordering on the mystical here. Jungian psychology differs from other systems in that it presents ethcal objec- tives that have much in common with magical goals. The discovery of the self might well be described as the completion of the Great Work, or the creation of the Philosophers' Stone. The expansion of consciousness, through the elevation of heretofore unconscious mate- rial, is a form of spiritual illumination. Ths does not mean that the individual who experiences illumination or self-realization will"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"spend the rest of his days in blissful meditation, but rather that he will gradually gain a more true understanding of himself and his con- nection to the divine. The goal of Jungian psychology is the creation of psychic whole- ness. It is not by any stretch of the imagination limited to the treat- ment of mental illness. Treatment today is often sought out to are a feeling of pointlessness or to find new purpose and direction in life. As we approach the twenty-first century, humanity is besieged by a collective neurosis and spiritual erosion. But the cure will not be found in adherence to rigid church dogmas or cold, detached meth- ods of psychology. Countering the disorientation of modern human- ity will require a combination of spiritual awareness, mystical experience, fundamental ethcs, and sound psychotherapies. A method for self-realization which encompasses magic and psychol- ogy, such as the Middle Pillar exercise, is part of the answer. The Symbol of Unity The psyche that has received the benefits of self-realization is expressed in a glyph called the uniting symbol. This is a symbol which portrays the union of all parts of the psyche, yet its synthe- sis transcends all of its separate components. It represents the restored equilibrium between the conscious and the unconscious. The uniting symbol portrays a balanced psychological state that we wish to achieve. In Eastern societies, the uniting symbol often takes the form of a drawing called a mandala, or \"magic circle,\" said to be a balanced glyph of the cosmos. The most important uniting symbol in the West is the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Reich and His Theories Wihelm Reich (1897-1957) studied medicine and Freudian analy- sis at Vienna University. He spent two years doing postgraduate work under Professor Wagner-Jauregg. It was during this time that he formulated two of hs most recognized theories. The first was the concept of \"physiological armoringn--muscular tension or physical rigidity that had the same effect as a neurosis, that is, it"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 123 serves as a mechanism for the repression of unwanted psychic con- tent. The second is the idea that schizophrenia is a \"bottling up\" of energy with the autonomic nervous system. Reich believed that psycl-uc problems caused muscular tension and any successful therapy had to treat both sides of the distur- bance-mind and body. His remedy was to develop a psycho-ana- lytical treatment combined with deep, often painful, massage which would break down the physical armament, and in turn lib- erate the psyche from the neurosis.25 This represented an assault on the psychic problem by using physical manipulation. He called his method of treatment vegetotherapy, or as it is sometimes known as \"non-verbal psychotherapy.\" The goal of tl-us treatment was not simply to relax the muscles, but to bypass all verbal or intellectual defense mechanisms, to reconnect the exterior ego with the interior reality, and release that material wl-uch was being repressed. In 1936 Reich began a series of experiments that resulted in l-us theory of orgone energy. This was a type of life force energy that Reich thought was vital to good health and which permeated all life. Some have compared it to the \"astral light\" of ceremonial magicians. Reich thought that muscular tension blocked the free flow of orgone energy in human beings-and that his vegetother- apy liberated the flow of orgone. His research got him into trouble, both in Nazi Germany and later in the U.S. where he built a machine that was said to extract orgone from the atmosphere and project it into the human body. Nevertheless, the theories of Reich are thought by many people to be an important conjunction between psychotherapy and magic. Transpersonal Psychology Coinciding with an interest in magic, today there is also increased attention being paid to transpersonal or depth psychology, a trend initiated by Jung and and further examined by psychologists such as Roberto Assagioli (1888-1975). The word transpersonal means that whch transcends the personal or the individual. Transpersonal psy- chology takes a more spiritual approach to the human dilemma, and does not reject the idea of the soul-rather, it embraces it. A"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"124 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC true system of transpersonal psychology must examine the highest aspects of the unconscious and take a phlosophcal as well as prag- matic approach to human evolution. Seeing that psychoanalysis was an incomplete system, Assagi- oli developed hs own form of therapy and called it psychosynthesis. Psychosynthesis accepts the idea of the soul, the libido, and the imagination as essential aspects of the human being. It also includes the use of symbolism and allegory to initiate alchemical change and psychc integration. May I emphasize fhefacf that the elements andfuncfions, comingfrom the superconscious, such as aesthetic, ethical, religious experiences, infuifion, inspiration, states of mystical consciousness, arefactual, are real in the pragmatic sense.. . because they are effective.. .producing changes both in the inner and the outer world. Therefore fhey are amenable fo observation and experimentation, through the use offhe sci- entific method in ways suited to their nature; also fhey can be influenced and utilized through psycho-spiritual fechniques.26 Assagioli defined the parts of the psyche (see Figure 6, p. 126) as: 1. The Collective Unconscious, a surrounding psychic \"membrane\" which permits constant and active interchange between all parts of the psyche and with the general psychc environment. It is the common primordial symbols, images, and metaphors of all humanity-the part of the soul that is shared. Archetypes of the collective unconscious include extremely primordial god images such as the Mesopotamian Apsu and the Greek Chaos. 2. The Higher Self27or the true transpersonal self whch is above and is unaffected by the thoughts from the mind-stream or the sensations of the body. It is that pure consciousness, the core of the self, that underlies all other aspects and functions of the psyche as well. All personal energy and consciousness issues from ths source. Archetypes of the hgher self include omnipotent sky gods such as the Babylonian Marduk, the Greek Zeus, and the Hebrew Yahweh. 3. The Conscious Selfor \"I\" is the ego or point of self-awareness. It is the seat of personal identity that we organize our field of"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 125 awareness around. Its function is to coordinate the vast amount of interior and exterior information that we acquire and to act as a intermediary between our internal and external realities. Experi- ence is processed by the ego through various functions such as the emotions, the senses, the intellect, and the imagination. To carry out these duties, the ego relies on discrimination, reason, and cer- tain defense mechanisms that often conflict with other aspects of the psyche, sometimes posing obstacles to growth and healing. Archetypes of the ego include all deities who have \"walked between the worlds\" of life and death (conscious and subcon- scious), such as the Sumerian Inanna and the Egyptian Osiris. 4. The Field of Consciousness, whch contains the ego, is the inces- sant flow of observable images, feelings, thoughts, sensations, and impulses. Archetypes of this region include several groups of deities with a variety of attributions: wisdom (Enki, Thoth, Hermes); love (Hathor, Aphrodite); war (Horns, Ares); pleasure (Bes, Pan); etc. 5. The Higher Unconscious or Superconscious is the transper- sonal level of the unconscious-containing higher intu- itions, inspirations, latent psychic functions, and spiritual energies. It is here that the higher self expresses itself in var- ious forms through archetypes. The ordinary person is usu- ally unaware of these forces and archetypes until they are brought to light during the process of self-realization. Archetypes of the superconscious include the first gods of a pantheon, such as the Greek Titans or the Norse Giants. 6. The Middle Unconscious is an inner region similar and acces- sible to that of the waking consciousness. This contains all thgs in our field of awareness that we are not normally aware of, but that we can become aware of. It is an uncon- scious matrix that underlies the conscious mind where the mental activities are \"incubated before their birth into con- sciousness. Archetypes of the middle unconscious include all deities who are associated with prophecy and oracles, such as the Greek divinities Apollo and Gaea."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"1 Collective Unconscious Figure 6: Assagioli's Model of the Psyche."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 127 7. The Lower Unconscious contains fundamental drives, primi- tive urges, inferior dreams, and complexes. This is the per- sonal unconscious which is the storehouse of hidden memories, repressed psychic content, and the shadow per- sonality. This part of the psyche is accessed by working with hypnosis, trance, and imagery. Archetypes of the lower unconscious include all underworld deities, such as the Sumerian goddess Ereshkigal and the Greek divinities Hades and Persephone. If we were to add anything to Assagioli's model it would be the body, or manifest psyche, which must be considered in a holistic psychology. Mind and body are interrelated extensions of one another. Just as physical discomfort can affect the mind, the mind, through focused visualization, can affect the body. Archetypes of the manifest psyche include all earth deities, such as the Egyptian Geb, the Babylonian Ninhursag, and the Greek Demeter. Assagiolifs division of the psyche is remarkably similar to the Qabalistic model of the soul. Like Jung, he saw the pressing need for all human beings to achieve a balanced inner integration and true self-realization, and he outlined a system for achieving this goal in four stages: 1. Thorough knowledge of one's personality. This includes a frank analysis of all parts of the psyche, both conscious and unconscious, including the shadow. Psychoanalysis is the method used by the therapist for this objective. (In magic and alchemy it is the first half of the equation solve et coag- ula-dissolve and coagulate.) 2. Control of the personality's vavious elements. After having discov- ered all parts of the psyche, we must take control of them. According to Assagioli, one of the most effective ways of adueving hs is a method called disidentifi~ation~28 whch aids in the dissolution of harmful complexes whose newly freed energies can be controlled and used toward more positive ends. Dispelling these complexes requires the methods of objectification, critical analysis, and discrimination. (In magic, the shadow aspects of the psyche are collectively called the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"evil persona-they must be recognized, subjugated to the magician's hgher spiritual will, and their energies trans- muted and employed for the completion of the Great Work.) 3. Realization of one's true sey the discovey or creation of a unibing center. The intermediate link which, if focused on and identi- fied with, allows for the integration/unification of the lower and higher selves, and freedom from selfish interests and personal limitations. A point of connection between the indi- vidual and the divine self, whch is reflected and symbolized in that point.29 4. Psychosynthesis: the formation or reconstruction of the personality around the new center. Once the unifying center is found, the next step is to gradually and systematically build a new \"ideal\" personality around it in an organized, purposeful manner and with clear, achievable goals in rnind.30 Practical psychosynthesis commences with the construction of this new personality. This process involves the active utilization of all available energies and the transmutation of unconscious and previously latent forces-development of those aspects of the per- sonality whch are weak or insufficient. It is accomplished through techruques of auto-suggestion, affirmation, visualization, and by the systematic training of the less developed functions of imagina- tion, will, and memory. Finally, all the various psychological ener- gies and functions must be coordinated as the new personality acheves a stable organized form. There are many levels in this process of transmutation and self- realization, and as stated earlier, they are not always entirely pleas- ant. It is a multi-faceted process which includes several stages-the elimination of impediments which block the flow of energies between the superconscious and the lower realms of conscious- ness, evolvement of latent or dormant higher functions (memory, will, imagination, etc.), and stages where the ego must yield to the work of the hgher self and withstand the stresses and unavoidable discomfiture that the process requires. In magic, this is the spiritual discipline of the Great Work and reunification-the second half of the solve et coagula formula of"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 129 alchemy. It represents our goal to \"become more than human,\" or in less mystical terms, to become the best possible human being we can be, evolving to our fullest potential. Various methods and tools are employed in psychosynthesis, just as they are in other transpersonal psychologies. In psychosyn- thesis, the focus is always on a holistic approach to treatment, and all techmques used are subservient to the health, well-being, and psy- chc integration of the individual. The keeping of a diary, dream analysis, free association, hypnosis, group analysis, psychodrama, relaxation, meditation, music therapy, autosuggestion, humor ther- apy, chromotherapy, disidentification, visualization, development of the will, utilization of the symbols and metaphors, transmutation and sublimation of sexual energies, and development of the irnagi- nation are but a few of the methods used to obtain self-realization. One of the goals of psychosynthesis is to integrate the super- conscious, as much as possible, into the conscious and unconscious realms. Numerous metaphors for ths process of self-realization and self-integration can be found in the language of the alchemists. What spiritual alchemy describes as the transformation of lead into gold is simply another way of describing the transmutation of the mundane into the spiritual, discord into harmony, and the personal into the transcendent. Imagination and the Transconscious Self With the lines between psychology and magic becoming increasingly transparent, we arrive at a new more transcendent interpretation of consciousness. The connecting link between all parts of the self is the transconscious se2f.31 Composed for the most part of the processes of imagination, intuition, and will, the transconscious is a reconciling intelligence with a unique nature. It has the ability to move through, communicate with, and cause change on all levels of the psyche, and it is capable of a wide range of powers associated with cornrnunica- tion and transformation. The imagination is the essential aspect of the transconscious self. It is a potent medium for the processes of inspi- ration, transmutation, integration, and transcendence. The transcon- scious imagination operates as a single organized mechanism,"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"purposefully flowing between all portions of the psyche with a uni- fying objective. Its vast creative resources are a primary influence in the development of music, dance, literature, and other art forms. The transconscious imagination expresses itself in two ways, the intuitive imagination and the creative imagination, which relate respectively to the natures of the reflective anima and the creative animus. Together, these two archetypes coalesce into the partly androgynous archetype of Hermes,32 the messenger god, who sym- bolizes the transconscious imagination as the psychopomp, the guide, healer, and protector of the soul. The language of the soul (and the imagination) is revealed in symbol, image, and allegory. Therefore in all mythologies the many figures, places, and situations are metaphors for different archetypes, as well as different aspects of the psyche and transformative experiences. Thus does Hermes, rep- resenting the soul guide and the transconscious self, communicate to all levels of the psyche through symbol and myth. The imagination is one of the most important tools of magic. A focused imagination is employed by magicians for everything from the consecration of talismans to healing. Concentration on a visu- alized image or symbol is the key to this type of working. In heal- ing, the source of the infection or injury is often visualized as being dissolved, or the sick individual is \"imaged as being free from the disease. The exploration of the unconscious realms usually begins with the \"image\" of descending into a basement, a cave, or the underworld. Superconscious levels are often contacted by visualiz- ing the climbing of a steep mountain-or climbing the branches of a mystical tree. Properly used, the imaginative fadties of the transconscious self can be used to activate the latent faculties of the psyche and bring renewed health and well-being to the entire mind/ body system. The Tree of Life The Qabalah is the mystical system of the medieval Jews; its exact origins are buried in antiquity. Its primary symbol, the Tree of Life, is said to be a glyph of the essence of God, the origins of the cos- mos, the soul of man, and a model of how to live in accordance"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 131 with the divine plan. It is also the most important symbol used by magicians and other practitioners of the western esoteric tradition. For our purposes, we will focus upon the Tree of Life as a \"uniting symbol\"-an image of the individuated psyche. The Tree itself is composed of ten Sephiroth (spheres or ema- nations) which are listed in order and are pictured in Figure 2 of Chapter Two, p. 28: Kether-the Crown, Chokmah-Wisdom, Binah- Understanding, Chesed-Mercy, Geburah-Strength, Tiphareth- Beauty, Netzach-Victory Hod-Splendor, Yesod-Foundation, and Malkuth-the Kingdom. The Parts of the Soul To the Qabalists the human soul is divided into three principal por- tions whch overlap in some instances (see Figure 7, p. 132). These are the Neshamah, the Ruach, and the Nephesh. The highest of these, the Neshamah, encompasses the Sephroth of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah. It corresponds to the highest aspirations of the soul and what Assagioli described as the higher unconscious or superconscious. The greater Neshamah is further sub-divided into three parts: the Yechidah, the Chiah, and the Neshamah. The Yechidah, centered in Kether, is our true divine self (compa- rable to Assagioli's higher self), the root essence of our spiritual nature. It is that part of us that is nearest to God, the most perfect level of the self. The Yechidah is the supreme undifferentiated qual- ity of mind that is pure, unexpanded consciousness. It simply is- \"I am that I am.\" The Chiah or life force, located in Chokmah, is the highest active principle in the human soul. It is our divine will, our inquis- itive urge to become more than human. Symbolized by the mascu- line soul image of the animus, or the figure of the Supernal Father, the Chah is the source of our powers of action. The sub-division of the Neshamah (as distinct from the greater Neshamah), is the intuitive soul located in Binah, although it lends its name to the other Supernals as being generally descrip- tive of the soul's greatest aspirations. It is also the most approach- able of the three Supernal parts of the soul. The Neshamah in"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 133 Binah is symbolized by the feminine soul image of the anima, as well as the Shekinah, the Supernal Mother, or the Gnostic Sophia. It is the source of human perception, comprehension, and spiri- tual understanding. The Neshamah in Binah initiates delineating ways in which the self can be defined as being unique to the individual as well as lim- itless in archetypal manifestation. It is the understanding of how the divine manifests itself through a multitude of archetypal forms, and how it can express itself more fully as the process of self-real- ization continues to unfold. The Neshamah carries within it the instinct and the blueprint for self-realization. The Neshamah as a whole is our true desire or deepest state of consciousness-the intuitive power that connects humankind with the divine-it is our superconscious, intuitive mind.33 According to the ancient Qabalists, this part of the soul remains dormant until the individual is spiritually awakened to its existence. The Neshamah (divine self, hgher soul, or hgher genius) embraces the elevated aspects of the collective unconscious-it is the divine spark that is common to all of humanity. Between the Neshamah and the middle part of the soul is a great boundary known as the abyss. This is the line of intersection between mortal and eternal, personal and transpersonal, separate- ness and unity. That whch is above the abyss is immortal and com- mon to us all. That which is below the abyss is temporary and individual. The shadowy Sephirah (or rather non-Sephirah) of Daath is located within the abyss. Its function is to create a bridge between the higher and middle parts of the soul (Neshamah and Ruach) so that the Neshamah can \"descend and the conscious mind thereby connect with, and perhaps gain some understanding of, the nature of spirit and divinity. The middle soul or rational self, the Ruach, is located in the five Sephiroth from Chesed to Yesod, although it is centered in Tiphareth. It also overlaps, to a lesser extent, Daath and Yesod. This is the conscious mind and reasoning powers-the conscious part of our being whch is the abode of the ego. This is the seat of \"outer\" consciousness, where humanity becomes aware of thought-images and is able to fashion thoughts into actions. It is here that human"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"beings use their powers of discrimination as the mind navigates continuously between both secular and transcendent functions. Five faculties are to be found in ths pentad of spheres: memory (Chesed), will (Geburah), imagination (Tiphareth), emotion (Net- zach), and intellect (Hod). The two lowest of these functions, cor- responding to the spheres of Netzach and Hod, are quite easy for the average person to understand. The three higher faculties of the Ruach, attributed to the fourth through the sixth Sephiroth, are somewhat more difficult to access. This is because of a demarcation called the Veil of Paroketh that exists on the Tree between Tiphareth and the two lower spheres of Netzach and Hod. Thus the higher Ruach faculties of memory, will, and imagination are obstructed somewhat and are often less accessible to the individual than are the lower functions of thinking and feeling. The Ruach contains both the middle unconscious and the field of consciousness of Assagioli's system, as well as hs concept of the con- scious self or ego. The higher self or lower genius (sometimes called the Augoei- des), whch mediates between the divine self of the Neshamah and the lower self, is located in the Ruach, primarily in Tiphareth.34 Ths is also the seat of the personal ego, whch interacts between the divine superconsciousness and the lower self, and constantly attempts to organize and interpret one's personal experience- both inner and outer experience. The persona, a conscious but artificial mask that we present to the outer world, is also to be found in the Ruach. The Nephesh, or lower self, resides in Yesod. Comparable to Assa- gioli's lower unconscious, the Nephesh is a low level of awareness that answers to the primal instincts, fundamental drives, and animal vitality from our prehistoric past. The Nephesh embraces the lowest components of the collective unconscious, those basic aspects whch relate to survival, sex, and the reptilian brain. It is also the seat of our personal unconscious. The Nephesh is sometimes equated with the aura and the etheric body, a kind of energy sheath which fonns the matrix for physical body. Proper use of the vital raw Nephesh energy is important in many aspects of magic, but it must always remain under the firm control of the Ruach, the conscious mind."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 135 The Nephesh is the most misunderstood part of the soul. Due to its placement and relationship to the Ruach above it and the G'uph below it, the Nephesh is also the seat of the shadow, the dark sub- conscious underside of the conscious ego. The shadow represents those basic desires that run contrary to society and to our own ideals of behavior and personality. During the course of life, personal con- flicts and neuroses are created wihn the psyche whch are banished to the Nephesh through the processes of denial and repression. Ths results in a type of dualism whch in turn creates the shadow and its various attributes. This dualism is expressed in the fact that on the one hand the Nephesh contains a vibrant primal energy and raw beauty that is crucial to magical work, but on the other hand, it also contains unconscious impulses whch often m contrary to spiritual growth. These impulses can be likened to Freud's id with its demands for instant gratification. Thus the Nephesh and the uncon- scious mind, together with the shadow, have all been unceremoni- ously rejected throughout hstory as scapegoats for problems which originated in the conscious mind (when the neuroses were con- sciously repressed rather than examined). Thus the Nephesh becomes the abode of many emotionally charged complexes, pho- bias, obsessions, delusions, and compulsive urges. Beyond this five-fold division of the human soul, there is one more portion that is sometimes overlooked. The lowest part is called the G'uph. Centered in Malkuth, the G'uph is closely tied to the physical body and the total range of all psycho-physical func- tions. It is a low level of subconscious intelligence which commu- nicates the current condition of the human body to the brain. Transpersonal psychotherapies and reputable systems of magic both work to examine and integrate the shadow of the Nephesh. This integration is a prerequisite for further spiritual/ magical work and self-realization. In magical orders such as the Golden Dawn, this is accomplished through initiation rituals which heighten the aware- ness of the student, combined with intellectual teachings and per- sonal meditations, rituals, visualizations, invocations, and exercises"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"136 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC such as the Middle Pillar.35 Once the shadow is confronted, recog- nized, and correlated into the psyche, its tremendous energy resources and rich symbology can be harnessed and utilized by the conscious mind whch can in turn stimulate the Neshamah. Magical disciplines strive to open a channel for the Neshamah to communi- cate with the lower portions of soul, bringing to the individual a con- scious recognition of the divine self. The higher faculties of the Ruach, including imagination, will, and memory, are also awakened. In order for this to take place, however, it is essential that the modern reader, who seeks renewed meaning in the purpose of life in addition to an understanding of his or her own inner workings, uniqueness, and place in the greater divine scheme of the universe, have the ability to bridge the ever-shrinking chasm that has divided psychology and magic. Both systems should be examined, and their respective bodies of knowledge culled for the gems of wisdom to be found in each. Ths process of reconnection between the modern science and the ancient art will be an act of healing, on both a personal and a collective level, which recognizes that all of reality is united under the integrating principle of spirit. No one should be led to believe that the process of self-real- ization, whether achieved through the principles of analytical psychology, the techniques of magic, or a combination of the two systems, is an easy matter. But here, even the smallest achieve- ment will be a monumental step in one's personal inner growth. If the mind is kept open to both new and old ways of exploring human development, one will discover that the psychologist's pursuit of a healthy, integrated human psyche, the alchemist's search for the Philosophers' Stone, and the magician's quest to complete the Great Work are all natural complements of each other. Humanity's spiritual development is a long and arduous jour- ney, an adventure through strange lands full of surprises, difficul- ties, and even dangers. It involves a drastic transmutation of the \"normal\" elements of the personality, an awakening of potentiali- ties which had hitherto been dormant, a raising of consciousness to new realms, and a functioning along a new inner dimension.36"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Psychology and Magic 137 Endnotes 1.

At that time Regardie wanted to leave hs original work intact and unen- cumbered by afterthoughts. Later, in such books as The Romance of Metaphysics (1946), Twelve Steps to Spiritual Enlightenment1 (1969), and Foundations of Practical Magic (1979), he went into more detail con- cerning the psychological and physical benefits to be gained through relaxation. Some of the techmques he suggested to hs patients and students alike are given below, along with other methods. Before the student commences any extended involvement with advanced magical techniques, he or she should first concentrate on gaining proficiency in the art of relaxation. This sounds simple enough, but it is not something to be passed over lightly. Even so, as Regardie noted, few spiritual schools emphasize basic tech- niques of relaxation, without which, nothing of substance and last- ing value can be accomplished. Many esoteric schools seem to focus on the idea that the simple contemplation of a mystical idea alone will naturally result in the required concentration and relax- ation. Sometimes ths idea is correct, but as Regardie observed, in most cases it is not. More often than not, as soon as the student tries"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"to concentrate on a spiritual affirmation or belief, he or she is beset by a horde of extraneous ideas which lead to distraction. As a result: . . .(D)istracted, and annoyed by this wandering of his mind, he makes determined efforts to bring the attention back. The total result is added ten- sion ofthe mind, repecting neuromusculnr hypertonicity in the body, and he becomes a nervous exhausted wreck within the space ofafew minutes. Regardie cites the remedy for this situation: It is absolutely imperative that the student should at the outset be taught a method which will enable him to relieve these neuromuscular tensions and this cramp ofthe mind in such a way as to enable him to continue by the employment of the same method to the contemplation of meta- physical ideas.2 The human body is a complex machne which converts food into energy. A great deal of energy is needed to carry out the inter- nal bodily functions alone. But even in a normal state of rest, about one-half of the body's energy can be squandered through tension and anxiety. This is why people often complain of being exhausted even when they've had plenty of sleep. Fatigue and psychic con- flicts create tension which eats up precious energy. And unfortu- nately, the demands of modern life often seem to make relaxation a rare luxury that few can afford. Like energy from food, the consumption of oxygen is also of primary importance to all somatic operations. Relaxation exercises can regulate the consumption of oxygen through the techniques of rhythmic breathing. To use an automotive metaphor, tlrus helps to keep the human \"motor\" running smoothly without burning too much oil or fuel. Thus relaxation helps to conserve large amounts of energy that is wasted by neuro-muscular tension. And who would not want to free up ths misspent energy and use it for things more meaningful and enjoyable than tense shoulder muscles, a stiff neck, or an upset stomach? Having an abundance of energy will alleviate these tensions and help one live life to its fullest. Regular performance of the relaxation exercises given here will reward the practitioner with physical and psychological dividends. Among the physical advantages are a decrease in blood pressure, a slowdown in respiration and heartbeat, and a noticeable decrease in muscular tension (along with the \"aches and pains\" that accompany"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Art ofRelaxation 141 such tension). The psychological effects are even more profound. Through deep relaxation, the student can aheve a state of pure con- sciousness in whch the physical or somatic element is completely removed. Eventually the body is able to relax so completely (as if all its needs have been fulfilled) that all body consciousness disappears. Ths has a very healing effect. Regardie suggested that a new point of view is needed, a scien- tific approach to metaphysics. Ths psychological approach will accomplish two thgs: 1) the complete relaxation of the rnindlbody mechanism, and 2) the training and education necessary to success- fully contemplate spiritual truths. . . .(T)he mind is able to control the body and its man~old&nctions - and in fact to affect the entire phenomenal world. . . . The methods indi- cated.. .will prove to the metaphysical novice that by means of evolving mental pictures he can himself induce a variety of psychological changes in his body. With this acquired ability, a quiet confidence based upon experience will come to him, an assurance that now he will be able to succeed in demonstrating metaphysically his ability to conquer and transcend all physical and mental circumstances of every kind.3 When relaxation techniques are successful in bringing about a state of consciousness where awareness of the body vanishes, the mind is no longer restrained by physical sensations, pains, or other corporeal impediments whch activate psychological activities that obstruct the hgher mental and spiritual functions. It is a feeling of ecstacy-calm and satisfying. Free from physical limitations, the mind is able to focus on profound spiritual truths. This is a real advancement in personal growth which results in increased mental balance and self-confidence. The relaxation of the body, which is so closely connected with the subconscious mind, dissipates those psychc blockages which cause tension, stress, and disease (or dis- ease). Beyond these important considerations, relaxation will pro- vide the student with great impetus toward approachng spiritual exercises and magical techniques with a sound psychological basis. Simply put, you need to relax. Your body requires it. Your spirit will rejoice in it. A few moments each day spent in a state of com- plete relaxation will be time well spent. And there is no reason two or more people cannot set aside time to perform these methods together and support each other's efforts."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"BODY AWARENESS EXERCISE One of the primary aims of any system of spiritual growth is the pro- curement of self-awareness or perception. The only way to increase sensitivity is to become aware-aware of that which is wih as well as that which is without. Try this Body Awareness Exercise.4 Sitting comfortably or lying on the floor, merely attempt to observe what is happening with your own body. (If you have trouble with your lower back, be sure to place a couple of pil- lows under each knee whenever lying down to meditate.) Simply watch your physical body and its various sensations. Do not do anything special. Breathe normally and don't try to relax or con- trol wandering thoughts. Just try to notice what happens. After a few moments, find a comfortable position and stay in it, without moving or consciously fidgeting in any way. Remain perfectly still. At first this exercise should be practiced for no more than ten minutes. Gradually increase the time spent in practice so that this exercise is extended to half an hour. Obvi- ously, this exercise will be simple to some, terribly difficult to others. Any urge to wiggle and release tension should resisted. The powers of concentration should also be developed as this awareness exercise is practiced. If your mind begins to wander, gently bring it back. Your powers of concentration will gradually but steadily become enhanced. During this practice, you may become aware of itching sensa- tions in various parts of your body. Do not attempt to scratch. Merely observe. Simply be aware of various body sensations with- out trying to alter or ignore them. Do not make judgments or criti- cisms about these sensations. Accept them as a part of you. Sensations will come and go in different areas of the body. Study them. It is sometimes a good idea to verbally express what you are feeling or experiencing. This exercise will result in a profound relaxation of nervous tension. Daily practice will heighten the function of self-aware- ness, something that is vital to the work of a magician. All com- plex ceremonies and rituals actually begin with this heightening of self-awareness."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Art of Relaxation 143 No special time period needs to be found to practice this. Lying in bed at night or in the morning provides an excellent opportunity to rehearse body awareness. This exercise should be done twice daily for about six months. In addition to this, short periods of tem- porary pause from activity can be taken throughout the day during bathing, shaving, or dressing, etc., in order to sharpen one's per- ceptions and observe what is happening within. THE CLEANSING BATH EXERCISE Take a shower to clean the body. Then fill the bathtub with warm water. Add bath salts or perfumed oil to the water. For an added spir- itual effect, whte candles and incense may be employed in the room. Some soothing music on the CD or tape player wouldn't hurt either. Simply soak for a few minutes and let go of any negativity or tension into the cleansing water. Then pull the plug and drain the water while remaining in the tub. Feel your doubts and wor- ries siphon out with the water, leaving you feeling relaxed and energized. Don't rush when getting up.

Take a deep full breath and hold it in for a few seconds. Then pucker the lips, leaving only a narrow opening in the mouth.

RELAXATION EXERCISE 2 For Two People This exercise is designed for the simple purpose of making one aware of the amount of muscular tension that is held within the body. Two people are needed for this method-one who will receive the benefit of relaxation, and the other who will aid the process. Here we will refer to the first person as the subject and the second as the assistant. For the subject loose-fitting garments, including slacks or sweatpants, are required. The subject should lie face up on a mat or thick blanket placed on the floor. If lower back pain is a problem, place a number of pil- lars under the subject's knees. A small cushon may be placed under the head. The subject should lie quietly for a few minutes, becoming aware of the body as in the first exercise. After a short time, the subject will probably come to the realization that he or she cannot totally relax. This is where the assistant comes in."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"146 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC The assistant should be seated to one side of the subject. He or she should commence by placing one hand under the subject's ankles and raising both legs a few inches off the floor. Next, the assistant should place the other hand under the subject's knees and slowly remove the hand from under the ankles. This will cause the lower part of the legs to drop, unless the subject still holds tension in the muscles. Now the assistant should hold the ankles together with one hand and remove the hand from under the knees, and gently attempt to separate the knees. If the subject is relaxed, each knee should fall outward. This may take several attempts before the subject relaxes enough to permit the knees to fall. Next the assistant relaxes the subject's arms one at a time. Each arm should be wiggled as if shaking a rope. Then, holding the elbow to the floor with one hand, the assistant raises the sub- ject's forearm perpendicular to the floor. When the arm is released it should be noted whether it falls easily, hangs in the air, or is lowered by the muscles. Again, many attempts may be required before the forearm is relaxed enough to drop. Moving on to the shoulders, the assistant elevates the elbow a few inches off the floor and releases it. If the shoulder joint is relaxed the elbow drops effortlessly. Each shoulder can be relaxed further by the assistant placing both hands under it, lifting it slightly, and allowing it to drop to the floor. The body should fall solidly and the head should roll without restraint on the neck. At this time the assistant should watch for signs of deep relax- ation, such as heavy sighs, slow deep breathing, lines on the face softening, and the whole body sinking down onto the floor. The assistant should then gently push his or her fingers into the abdominal muscles bordering the hips, one side followed by the other. A slight pressure is maintained during which the muscles may give spasms of resistance due to tension. Alternate this applica- tion of pressure from one side to the other until the muscles relax. After this the assistant should apply slight pressure on the chest and sides in the same manner. For the final part of this exercise the assistant should gently lift the subject's head a couple of inches and allow it to flop back"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Art of Relaxation 147 onto the cushion. If this is done several times, the subject should feel deeply relaxed. After a few moments of restful meditation, the subject and the assistant may switch roles and repeat the exercise. RELAXATION EXERCISE 3 Tension, Relaxation, and Visualization (Note: If we accept the premise that psychological states can effect immediate responses in the mindlbody system, then it follows that mental pictures or visualizations can be used to purposely effect an attitude of total relaxation prior to magical work.) Lie face up on a mat or thick blanket placed on the floor and relax. Let the weight of your body sink into the floor. Begin breathing in a rhythmic fashion. Start with the top of the head. Inhale and deliberately tense the muscles of the forehead for a moment. Visualize your brain and the muscles of your brow. Tense the muscles as much as you possibly can. Then exhale, let go of the tension, and relax the forehead totally. Feel and visualize your muscles as they relax. Do this two or three times. After a brief period of time, Inhale and tense the muscles of your face, squeezing your eyes shut. With your mind's eye, see your face contorted with muscular tension. Then exhale. Release the tension and imagine the muscles of your face slipping back into their natural pose with the eyes gently closed. Repeat two or three times. Next, inhale and tense the jaw and neck, clenching the teeth and pushing the tongue against the roof of the mouth. Visualize your face with lips pressed firmly shut. Then exhale and release the tension and let your jaw and tongue relax. Repeat as before. Now turn your attention to the shoulders and upper arms, tensing them as you inhale, using your elbows to press down on the floor. Visualize your shoulders against the floor as you hold"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"them stiffly, slightly off the floor as they seem to shrink inward. Then exhale and release the tension, stop pressing with your elbows and imagine the shoulders expanding slightly outward as they sink back into the floor. Repeat. Focus on your lower arms and hands. Put your thumbs inside your palms and clench your hands into fists. Press your wrists into the floor to add tension to your forearms as you inhale. Visualize the closed fists and stiff arms. Then exhale. Relax your limbs and see the hands uncurl slightly from their martial pose into a more peaceful one. Repeat. Center your attention on your back, pushing it into the floor as you inhale. Start with the lower back followed by the upper back. Visualize your spine as it is pressed into the floor. Exhale. Relax your back and imagine it gently springing back to its normal state. Repeat. Now focus on your chest. Inhale deeply and expand your chest to its absolute fullest capacity. Hold your breath (and the corresponding tension) for a few moments and visualize your chest and ribs extended to their limits. Exhale naturally. With your mind's eye, see your chest gently fall back and assume its normal state. Repeat. Tense the muscles in your lower abdomen. Inhale and tighten your abdominal muscles as though you were trying to fit into a tight pair of pants, or as if your navel were being pulled toward your spine. Visualize your abdomen being pulled tight against your spine and imagine the organs of your abdomen pressed closer against one another. Then exhale and release the tension. See your muscles and organs spring gently back into place. Next tense the muscles in your buttocks and thighs, turning your toes in toward each other as you inhale. Visualize that your thighs are as taut as those of a runner who is about to sprint for- ward. Exhale and allow your legs to drop back into their normal position. See your thigh muscles relaxing. Repeat. Now observe your knees and lower legs. Inhale, pressing the backs of your knees into the floor and bend your feet so that your toes are pointing toward your head. Visualize your calves and knees pressed firmly against the floor. Then exhale and let your lower legs drop back into their normal position as you see the mus- cles relax. Repeat."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Art of Relaxation 149 Focus on your feet and ankles. Inhale and point your feet like a ballerina standing on pointe. Curl your toes. Visualize your feet tensed in this way. Then exhale and allow the feet to bounce back. Visualize your feet and toes totally relaxed. Repeat as before. Now inhale. Tense your entire body as much as possible. Imagine your body as stiff as a board. Then exhale and relax fully and deeply. Visualize your body becoming almost liquid in its relaxed state. Do this at least three times, then remain totally relaxed. Notice how much more relaxed your body is after the balancing effects of flexing and releasing. Breathe deeply without strain. Visualize yourself enveloped in a sphere of brilliant white light. Imagine your body bathed in this light and feel its warmth on your skin. As you inhale feel the divine light filling your lungs and spreading throughout your entire body to the ends of your fingers and toes, giving you a sense of ultimate peace and relaxation. As you exhale breathe out a portion of this endless light, giving its tranquil effects back to the divine source in a cycle of flux and reflux. The more light you breathe out, the more light you breathe back in, until your whole being seems as if it is created out of this divine light. Now visualize a golden sphere of healing light in the center of your body around the area of your heart. Feel its soothing warmth. See this sphere traveling to areas of your body where some tension remains. Whatever part of your body the sphere touches becomes fully relaxed and regenerated. Let the sphere traverse over every part of your body, and when this is done, place it back in its original position, centered on your heart. Continue to relax in this state for a few moments. Then take a few deep breaths and feel the vitality stirring within as you end the meditation. (Note: A group of people may elect to perform this exercise together. If ths is the case, one person should record the exercise on a tape player, with soothing music in the background. The participants should lie on the floor-in a circle if possible with heads pointing in toward the center-with a fair amount of space between each person. Play the recording and begin the exercise.)"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"150 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC RELAXATION EXERCISE 4 Visualized Circulation In the previous exercise the student was encouraged to become more aware of the body's physical sensations. In ths exercise the student learns how to use the techruques of relaxation to manipulate body sensations in a premeditated fashon in order to cause certain changes that are both physical and psychological. Relaxation is a crucial step in changing one's conscious awareness from the mundane events of the day to a more spiri- tual focus. It is also an essential procedure that will always be undertaken prior to more advanced techniques and rituals. For this technique it would be helpful if the student had a basic understanding of human anatomy. Before sitting or lying down, spend a minute or two engaged in physical exercise to increase the blood circulation and stimu- late deep breathing. (One way to do this is to pretend that you are skipping rope in a stationary position.) Then stand upright with the legs slightly apart. Take a deep breath and exhale, expelling all of your air as you let yourself fall forward from the waist, completely relaxed, hands hanging near the feet for a moment. Allow yourself to be totally limp from the waist up. Inhale and bring yourself back to the full standing position. Repeat ths process about a dozen times. Be aware only of the various body sensations. The actual relaxation exercise, whch lasts approximately one-half hour, can now begin. Take some very deep breaths. Sit or lie down on the floor, and remain aware only of what the body is feeling. Visualize your brain just as you have seen the human brain in drawings-a large gray-whte walnut shaped organ divided into two hemispheres. Imagine it clearly. Concentrate. Do not allow your mind to wander from the visualization. If your mind wanders, gen- tly bring it back. Hold the image of the brain in your mind until you begin to feel a warmth spreading out from the center of your head. Imagine yourself stimulating the flow of blood to the brain, relaxing the blood vessels there. You may be aware of a gentle tingling sen- sation. Picture the blood vessels within the brain dilating enough to"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Art ofRelaxation 151 hold larger amounts of blood. This turns the brain pink, resulting in the sensation of warmth that you are experiencing. Move on to the eyes, visualizing them as two balls held in place by muscles. Imagine the muscles becoming enlarged as you channel more blood to the area. Ths stimulates the feeling of warmth. Then relax, imagining the eyeballs sinking back gently into their sockets. Follow this procedure for the rest of the head-visualize the warming blood flowing into the blood vessels of the temples, cheeks, ears, nose, lips, tongue, and ch. In all cases, feel the warmth and the tingling of the blood gradually followed by the feeling of relaxation. See the heated blood flowing into the muscles of the neck, the shoulder joints, the arms, hands, and fingertips. Imagine the pink muscles saturated with blood. Feel the radiant warmth of the blood tingling within the fibers of your muscles. You should now be approximately ten minutes into the exercise. The remaining time should be spent visualizing the rest of the body in the same manner-imagine once again the muscles of the neck, the glands, the larynx, the pharynx, and shoulders. Imagine that the blood flows into every artery and capillary. Now concentrate on the abdominal area and the internal organs. Spend a few moments on each organ separately-the heart, the lungs, the brondu, the liver, pancreas, intestines, kidneys, etc. (The more you relax the abdomen, the more likely it is that the rest of the body will relax also.) Finally imagine the current of warm blood separating into two mighty arterial rivers of blood which flow from the pelvis into the thighs, knees, legs, feet, and toes. Relax completely. The increased blood supply caused by the successful perfor- mance of this exercise will induce a broad sense of relaxation. Once you have completed ths portion of the exercise, observe how you feel. Let a sense of total repose and fulfillment be perma- nently recorded in your mind. Feel the pleasure of the moment. Impress the image thoroughly and strongly upon your mind. If you are able to remember ths experience clearly, it can be evoked at any time. Whether you are driving a car or riding on an airliner, you can remember the feeling of pleasurable relaxation and evoke the mem- ory whch will result in the tension leaving the muscles of your body"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"152 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC If at any time you wish to relax, simply take a deep breath and imagine the word relax as you release the air from your lungs. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, command yourself to relax. Remember the serenity of complete relaxation and it will be instantly brought back to you. Eventually this will become a condi- tioned reflex, the effects of whch will be complete and automatic. Ths exercise should be performed at least once a day. (Twice would be better-once in the morning and once in the evening.) Variations on this techmque could also be used to help cure ill- nesses. One might imagine the stream of blood flowing through and breaking down a cancerous growth for elimination from the body-or the flow of blood may be seen to heal a wound. RELAXATION EXERCISE 5 The Practice of the Divine Essence For ths exercise the student should review and practice all of the relaxation and body awareness exercises prescribed earlier. To perform this exercise, lie down in a comfortable position. Once relaxed, reflect on the fact that the entire surface of your body is covered by millions of tiny pores. In truth, every muscle and organ in the body is composed of cells which have minute areas of space between them. Imagine that the pores on the skin of your face (nose, cheeks, and brow) are stretched wide open. (Ths should only take a matter of seconds if you have performed the previous exercises regularly.) Then proceed to visualize the skin on the scalp and back of the head in the same fashion. Continue on to the skin of the neck, shoulders, arms, chest, abdomen, hips, thghs, legs, and feet. Imag- ine the surrounding membrane of every part of the body, including the internal organs, permeated by a series of pores loosely weaved together by a net-like substance."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Art ofRelaxation 153 Once you have obtained a feeling of the opening of all the pores in your body, return to reflect upon your head. Imagine that the brain also has become full of open pores and is now somewhat sponge-like. Apply this visualization to every part of the body-the bones, muscles, and soft organs-all becoming like sponges. When this visualization is complete, imagine that the surround- ing atmosphere is able to easily penetrate your body, as if the air itself flowed right through the pores and holes of your body. The air satu- rates you, entering into every pore. Imagine that when you inhale, the air enters your body through the bottoms of your feet; when you exhale, the air leaves your porous body from the top of your head. Experiment with similar visualizations, pushing the inhalations and exhalations of air through your body in various directions. A relationshp exists between the elements of air and spirit. Therefore imagine that the air cascading through your body is the air of the divine spirit-the Ruach Elohim. It exists everywhere, sur- rounding you on all sides-omnipotent and infinite. This spirit is without limitation or opposition. It is eternal truth, wisdom, and love. It is light and life. This is what you should imagine flowing freely through every pore of your body and mind. Regular practice of this exercise is designed to bring the stu- dent to a hgh level of divine consciousness. Every aspect of mystical experience and knowledge may be brought fully into play during this meditation. Although it is an extension of the aspirant's earlier work, this meditation is designed to bring about a true realization concerning the infinity of the eternal spirit and the complete fulfillment of the divine within. Many of these exercises require that the student lie on the floor to get the maximum benefit. However, as one relaxes and lets go of all tension, there is always the possibility of falling asleep. This is not a problem and with practice it will pass. Even- tually the student will be able to separate mental consciousness from body consciousness. The body will be completely relaxed, while the mind remains active and alert."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"154 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC ADDITIONAL EXERCISES Finding the Right Position There mav be times when the student will want to be seated for meditation and visualization work. A number of different postures may be used by the student for ths purpose. Eastern Pose For this pose you will need a pillow, cushon, or folded blanket on the floor. Seat yourself on the front edge of the pillow. (Ths will help slant the hps forward and support the lower back.) Bend your legs so that you are sitting cross-legged with the left foot under the right thigh and the right foot under the left thigh. Keep your knees level and your spine straight. Rest your hands palms downward on your knees and keep your elbows relaxed. Close your eyes and breathe rhythmically. The main meditation may now commence. Western Pose For this pose you will need a chair and a small cushon. Be seated on the front half of the chair with the spine well away from the back of the chair. With the cushion under your feet, be sure that the lower part of your legs forms a ninety-degree angle to your thghs, which may be together or separated slightly. Rest your hands palms downward on your knees and keep the elbows relaxed. The spine should be kept straight. Close your eyes and breathe rhyth- mically. The main meditation can now begin. MIND AWARENESS EXERCISE Once the student has gained some experience with the techruques of relaxation, he or she is encouraged to raise the level of awareness from the body to the mind. The exercise employed for ths purpose is"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Art of Relaxation 155 a form of \"free association\" used by psychotherapists. It is performed by simply letting the mind wander as it may without obstruction. Set a predetermined amount of time for the session before- hand and use an alarm clock or timer. (Twenty minutes or half an hour is appropriate.) At the end of the practice, stop immediately so that discipline is maintained. Sit comfortably in one of the positions mentioned above. A tape recorder should be set up ahead of time to record the entire session. As you sit, calmly articulate any thought, idea, memory, or feeling that happens to arise, into the microphone. Speak indis- criminately, without planning what to say next. At the end of the session, play back what has been recorded. This practice will give the student a good idea of the hidden contents within the psyche. Some of it may seem shocking to the student who has not always been mentally \"honest\" with him or herself. The student may experience the opening of a floodgate of pent-up feelings or thoughts that have been censored for years. However, the simple act of becoming aware of these hid- den thoughts is part of the process of being able to come to terms with them. The mental pressure and inner conflicts caused by these repressed thoughts will eventually dissipate along with the number of \"breaks\" in concentration. This method of mind awareness should at least be practiced until the shock and anxiety usually encountered by the recognition of one's disturbing thoughts has vanished completely. What is most important about this exercise is that there should be no criticism, judgment or self-loathing concerning anythmg that might come up during the session. Your thoughts are a part of you, just like your arm or your leg. They are simply childlike parts of yourself that need training. With time and discipline, the energies of these juve- nile portions of the psyche can be directed toward higher pursuits."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"156 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE WILL EXERCISE The development of the will is one of the most important tasks faced by the student. It is a principal factor in the attainment of spiritual progress. A practical and most effective method for training the will is to consciously set up specific goals for a predetermined period of time, and if diverted from keeping these goals, to withhold some- thing that gives enjoyment. This method is based on a type of behavior modification therapy. Keep in mind that there is nothing moralistic in this procedure. The student who undertakes this prac- tice is not \"avoiding (bad) vices in favor of (good) virtues.\" The point is to strengthen the will, which in and of itself is nei- ther good nor bad. Ths exercise is a disciplinary vow that a certain habitual action will be denied by the aspirant. In order to perform this techruque properly, the student should deliberately set a goal which is not in any way connected with a \"bad\" habit, such as smoking, swearing, or drinking. An impersonal and guilt-free atti- tude of detachment should be maintained. The aspirant should select a personal idiosyncrasy such as tapping the foot to music, saying a certain word, or crossing the legs when sitting. This will help ensure that the student does not make a senseless virtue out of what is merely designed as a discipline exercise. One of the most effective ways to reinforce the will is to dis- pense a mild electric shock. (One can usually find a small device which will deliver a slight shock in any store that sells supplies for stage magic.) The shock is very light, but can be quite sur- prising. If this device is employed immediately following the broken vow, a mental connection is made which will become a fixed and potent reminder that sets up a continual alertness on the part of the will. By doing this the student will reinforce the connection between the unwanted action and the electric shock. It is important to carry the device with you at all times so that the disciplinary action can be delivered immediately after the transgression. It is through this discipline that the will obtains its training and effectiveness. All violations of the oath should be rapidly \"punished\" in order to make an enduring impression on"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Art of Relaxation 157 the student's mind. This can be done either by administering a light shock as described above, or by denying oneself something that is pleasurable. This technique accomplishes two hgs. First, a constant vigi- lance is established whch generates a potent will power. Second, the mind itself is placed gradually under the control of the aspirant's will. Ths in turn helps the student's faculty of concentration immensely. THE RITE OF ELEMENTAL EQUILIBRATION One of the goals of magical work is to bring to the student an awareness of the inner elemental make-up of hs or her psyche. Ths awareness also includes the ability to experience the elements5 and balance them in equal portion within the mind. It is vitally important that all magical students be able to con- sciously equilibrate the psychic elements. The simple rite of the Qabalistic Cross is very useful for this purpose, however, we also suggest that the student perform the following Rite of Elemental Equilibration to actively combat any elemental imbalances that may occur during the transformative process of self-development. Ths is a ritual that should be performed regularly. Stand facing the east and perform the four-fold breath a number of times until you feel relaxed. Imagine a brilliant light above your head. Reach up with your right hand as if to touch this light and bring the light down to your forehead. Imagine the yellow triangle of'air superimposed over the upper part of your body. Vibrate \"SHADDAI EL CHAI\" (Shah-dye El Chai). A Then picture the black triangle of earth covering the lower por- tion of your body. Bring your hand down as if pointing to the ground and vibrate \"ADONAI HA-ARETZ (Ah-doh-nye ha-Ah-retz). B Visualize the red triangle of fire superimposed over the right side of your body.

Tlus exercise, like many in tlus chapter, is taken from our book Self-Initiafion into the Golden Dawn Tradition. 5. In magic there are four basic elements (fire, water, air, and earth) which are regarded as realms, kingdoms, or divisions of nature. They are the basic modes of existence and action, and the building blocks of everythg in the universe. A fifth element, spirit, is said to bind together and govern the lesser four."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT YOGA, CHAKRAS, AND THE WISDOM OF THE EAST A s Regardie stressed in Chapter Four, the Qabalistic Sephi- roth, particularly those of the Middle Pillar, bear some resemblance to the chakra system of yoga, the Hindu mys- tical tradition. Many people, including authors, make the common mistake of calling Tiphareth \"the heart chakra\" or referring to Yesod as \"the moon chakra.\" In fact the cover of Llewellyn's second edi- tion of Regardie's The Middle Pillar (see Figure 1, p. xi) shows the chakras superimposed over the Qabalistic Tree of Life with the twin serpents of the Caduceus of Hermes. As easy as it is for some to transpose the terms \"Sephrah\" and \"chakra,\" ths habit should be avoided, since it only adds to confusion between the two systems. It would be better to refer to the Sephiroth of the Middle Pillar exer- cise as galgalim,l whch is Hebrew for \"whlings.\" There are five Sephiroth on the Middle Pillar in contrast to seven chakras in the Eastern system. The Sephrah of Kether can be said to generally correspond to the crown and brow chakras, while the shadowy sphere of Daath can be compared to the throat chakra. Tiphareth approximates the heart and solar plexus chakras. Yesod has certain similarities with the navel chakra. And while Malkuth can be compared in some ways to the root chakra, the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"tenth Sephirah is centered in the feet and ankles, while the root chakra is at the base of the spine. But differences between the Qabalistic and yoga systems are great. As we have seen, some of the Sephroth and the chakras are similar, but not exact. Take all of the ten Sephiroth into consideration and this similarity is diminished. The Sephiroth and the chakras have different functions, different correspondences, and a host of other attributes that are specific to the cultural roots of each system. Whereas the chakras are located along the spine and are linked to the endocrine glands and nerve centers, the Sephiroth have little corre- spondence with the inner organs and are located on the midline of the body. The colors assigned to the Sephroth are also much differ- ent from those of the chakras.2 Furthermore, the chakras are acti- vated from the lowest to the highest, the exact opposite of the Western system in which the highest is always invoked first. In many ways, the Middle Pillar exercise is a much safer prac- tice than the eastern techruque of activating the chakras through Kundalini yoga, which requires a competent instructor to teach it properly. In Kundalini yoga, it is possible for the student to activate more power than he or she can safely handle, resulting in a shock to the psychic mechanism. This is not true of the Middle Pillar, which never bestows more energy than the student can manage, and which can easily be learned without the benefit of a teacher. Here we will briefly describe the basics of yoga so that the reader will have a better understanding of the differences and the sirnilari- ties between the two systems. Both methods provide valid psycho- logical and spiritual tools for the balance, healing, and integration of the human psyche. They relate to different parts of the subtle body, and thus each system requires a different method of working. Yoga It is presumed that yoga was developed in India by the inhabitants of the Indus River Valley. The exact methods and philosophy of the practice were gathered into a coherent system by Patanjali, a philosopher of the second century B.C.E. The various disciplines of yoga are not restricted to Hindus, however, for people of all faiths"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Yoga, Chakras, and the Wisdom ofthe East 161 have studied and practiced them. The Sanskrit word yoga means \"union,\" and from it is derived the English word \"yoke.\" Th~s implies a \"harnessing\" of our latent psychic energies. Yoga is a science of physical, mental, and spiritual integration. It is a systematic method of self-development and mystical ascent to universal wholeness on all levels of being. The main objective of yoga is the purification of the soul in order that the incarnated ego may be liberated from the karmic wheel. There are several different types of yoga, such as: Bhakti Yoga: Union through devotion. Dharma Yoga: Union through the virtues of religious duties. Hatha Yoga: Union through physical discipline-breathing and postures. Karma Yoga: Union through proper action or work in daily life. Kriya Yoga: Union through the sacred outlook in everyday life, domestic ritual, and purification. Laya Yoga: Union through developing the \"serpent fire\" or kundalini force. Mantra Yoga: Union through spells and incantations. Raja Yoga: Union though meditation. Hatha yoga, which emphasizes physical and mental discipline, is by far the most popular type of yoga. The various asanas or pos- tures of hatha yoga are the practices that most Westerners associate with Eastern mysticism. Pranayama or \"the breath way\" includes numerous techmques for breath control and vital energy manipu- lation. The discipline of concentration on a symbol or object is known as dharana, \"holding.\" This is the ability to hold one image in the mind to the exclusion of all outside distractions. Closely affiliated with hatha yoga and sometimes considered a part of it is laya yoga, which is dedicated to the development of the subtle body, including the chakras and that mysterious force known as prana."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"162 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC Prana According to the system of yoga, vital life force called prana courses through the human body by means of a network of minute con- duits or canals known as nadis. This psycho-physical circuitry is often called the \"subtle body.\"3 In yoga the physical body is refined not simply for its own sake, but in order that it may serve the sub- tle body. The main nadi or conduit is called the sushumna, which runs from the bottom of the spine to the top of the cranium. Along its length the sushumna connects the seven chakras or main energy centers. Many more chakras are said to exist within the body, but all are governed by the primary seven. The two other important nadis are known as the ida and the pingala. They start at the base of the spine and wind around the sushumna like strands of DNA. The ida ends at the left nostril and is associated with the moon and the left side of the body. The pin- gala terminates at the right nostril and corresponds to the sun and the right side of the body. These two nadis take in prana from the surrounding environment, and they are important to the practice of pranayama or the discipline of breath control. The ability to con- trol breathing is equated with the ability to control the amount of prana retained in the body. In this way the revitalizing prana energy can be fully utilized to the benefit of the practitioner. The Chakras The chakras (\"wheels\" or \"lotus flowers\") are power centers within the aura that correspond to certain glands or organs in the body. They are reservoirs of vibrant energy-psychic sense organs where prana energy is concentrated in the human body. They can be described as spinning wl-urlpools of energy that exist at certain crossroads where mind and body or spirit and matter, meet. These centers are listed (in both position and level of consciousness) from the lowest to the highest. They are often visualized as discs or orbs of color running up the center of the body. The mental, psychic, and physical state of any individual can be characterized by analyzing the level of vibrant energy at every chakra. In the average human being, tl-us vital energy is confined to the three lowest centers. As"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Yoga, Chakras, and the Wisdom of the East 163 the individual undergoes the process of spiritual growth, the major- ity of energies are transferred to the higher chakras. These psychic centers must be developed, like any growing flower, so that their petals are allowed to open and bloom. Like the Western Sephroth, each chakra has a series of corre- spondences attributed to it. These include colors, sounds, deities, symbols, planets, exercise positions or asanas, and parts of the body, among a host of other associations. All of these correspondences can be called upon for meditation and ritual work with the chakras. Tattvas Before describing the individual chakras, we must mention a few words about the tattvas (see Figure 8, p. 164). The word tattva means \"quality,\" and it is used to describe a characteristic, essence, truth, or element. There are five primary tattvas which conform to the five basic elements.\"hese tattvas are also used as emblems for some of the chakras (see Figure 9, p. 168). The first element of earth corresponds to the tattva known as prithivi which is represented by a yellow square. Traits of this ele- ment include cohesion, materialization, and solidarity. Apas is attributed to water, the second element and the principle of liquid, portrayed by a silver crescent. Tejas corresponds to fire, the third element, symbolized by a red triangle. Its attributes include trans- mutation and heat. Vayu is assigned to air, the fourth element, rep- resented by a blue circle. Vayu symbolizes motion and the principle of vapor or gas. The fifth and final element of ether or spirit is referred to as akasha, symbolized by a black oval.

Muladhara, the base or root chakra. The first chakra is located at the sacrum at the base of the spine, near the anus. Associated glands / organs are the ovaries, the testes, and the pelvic plexus.5 The traditional color of this chakra is yellow.6 An alternate color given for this center is red.7 Sometimes called the earth chakra, its symbol is prithivi, the yellow square of elemental earth. Basic survival needs are the focus of this center. Muladhara means \"basic,\" \"fundamen- tal,\" or simply \"root base.\" Th~s center is associated with the physi- cal self, elimination of waste, and basic needs of movement, sustenance, support, grounding, survival, and protection from dan- ger. It also controls the function of sex, a role it shares with the sec- ond chakra. Bowel and sexual disfunctions result from psychic '%locks\" at the base center. 2. Svadisthana, the navel chakra, controls sexuality. It is located about three inches below the navel. Associated organs are the kid- neys and the adrenal glands. The generative organs and the hypogastric (lower abdominal) plexus are also attributed here. Tra- ditionally this chakra is colored light blue. An alternative color is vermillion (brilliant orange-red).8 The symbol of this center is apas, the silver-white crescent of elemental water. The word Svadisthana means \"one's own self\" or \"dwelling place of the self.\" Sometimes called the \"moon chakra,\" the Svadisthana controls the balance and flow of bodily fluids. It functions to preserve the human species through procreation. The issues of family, home, health, and secu- rity also correspond here, as well as the raw vitality of \"gut-level\" emotion, unfettered desire, and the unconscious. Fluid imbalances such as anemia are controlled through this center. 3. Manipura, the solar plexus chakra, is located just below the ster- num. Manipura means \"diamond,\" or \"city of precious stone.\" The pancreas, liver, and spleen are also associated here. The traditional color of tlus chakra is red. An alternative color is gold? Its symbol is tejas, the red fire triangle. Ths chakra is the center of metabolic energy, enthusiasm, ego, identity, and the personal will for power and control. Its foundation is the individual's personal being or essence. (Anyone who has ever experienced the sensation of having"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"a \"knot in the stomach when anxious or tense will appreciate the importance of the solar plexus center. Continuous stress at this cen- ter may cause a number of gastro-intestinal disorders.) 4. Anahata, the heart chakra in the middle of the chest, is the cen- ter of love, feelings, connection, relationships, associations, cooper- ation, and compassion. It is also the center of meditation, devotion and prayer. The word Anahata means \"unstruck sound,\" implying that its sound is completely inner-a silent sound. The thymus gland and the cardio-pulmonary plexus are associated here. The traditional color of the fourth chakra is green. An alternate color is deep red.10 Its symbols are vayu, the blue circle of elemental air, and the blue hexagram or six-pointed star. This center is the bridge between the more physical energies of the first three chakras, and the transcendent energies of the final three centers. Disorders of the heart and lungs fall under the realm of the fourth chakra. 5. Visuddha, the throat chakra, is located in the hollow of the throat. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are associated here, along with the vocal chords and the pharyngeal plexus. The name Visuddha means \"purity.\" The traditional color for this center is purple. An alternate color is gold.11 Its symbol is the akasha or black egg of spirit. The fifth chakra controls respiration, auditory functions, cleansing, sensations, intuition, perception, psychc ability, commu- nication, creativity, and self-expression. It is a center of focus and direction. (When psychc blockage occurs at this center, it is usually described as a feeling of being \"all choked up\" or having \"a lump in the throat.\") Malfunctions of the thyroid, as well as speech and hearing disorders, are under the dominion of the fifth chakra. The essence of this center is associated with sound, particularly vibra- tion. In yoga the Visuddha is a very important center of alchemical transmutation. It is also said to produce a secretion of immortality. 6. Ajna, the brow or third eye chakra, is located in the forehead. It is associated with the pituitary gland and the frontal lobes of the brain. The word Ajna means \"order\" or \"command,\" which indi- cates that activation of ths chakra is indicative of true order and mastery. The traditional color here is translucent blue. An alternative color is whte.12 Its symbol is a circle with two wings or petals, which correspond to two pituitary lobes and the two major nadis of pingala"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Yoga, Chakras, and the Wisdom offhe East 167 (right petal) and ida (left petal). This center controls all hgher intel- lectual functions, imagination, intuition, insight, consciousness, spir- itual wisdom, knowledge, and true sight. Activation of the sixth chakra is thought to be responsible for all experiences of astral vision and astral traveling, as well as all encounters with the higher self. It is attributed to the \"element\" of light. 7. Sahasrara, the crown chakra located at or above the top of the head, is associated with the pineal gland and the cerebral cortex. Traditionally this center is given the various colors of the rainbow. An alternate color is clear.13 The word Sahasrara means \"thousand- petalled lotus,\" whch is the symbol of this chakra, alluding to the thousands of brain cells withn the cerebrum. The seventh chakra controls all aspects of mind and body, and it regulates the activities of all the other chakras. Its energy is often described as pure thought, spiritual understanding, bliss, peace, eternal life, super- consciousness, and the divine white light. The seventh chakra is activated at peak instances of oneness with the divine. It is said to be the abode of Shva (illuminated consciousness), who demolishes ignorance and illusion.14 We should add that although the chakras are correlated to cer- tain physical organs, glands, or nerve caters, they are not solely physical centers. To think of them in this way is to fall into the trap of Western rationalization. Anyone who believes that the chakra system is a network of purely physical organs and responses will never be able to experience the \"raising of the kundalini.\" Since they are partially corporeal and partially incorporeal, the chakras can influence and be influenced by both the material and the spiritual worlds. The subtle body of the individual is affected by hs or her physical habits (diet, posture, physical tension, etc.) as well as mental and psychological habits (thought processes, emo- tions, imagination, aptitude, etc.)."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"2.

Through the spiritual disciplines of yoga, exercise, breath control, and meditation, this \"serpent power\" is stimulated. It rises up the spine, vitalizing, puri- fying, and equilibrating each chakra it comes into contact with. With each chakra thus attained, the individual reaches new plateaus of spiritual development. \"Raising the kundalini\" from the lowest to the highest chakra is the Eastern method for attaining hgher levels of consciousness that are associated with the experience of union with the divine. It is equivalent to the various stages of the \"Great Work\" of Western mystics and magicians. Tradition says that when the kundalini unites with the crown chakra, the result is a shock to the nervous system which arouses the pineal gland out of its dor- mancy to provide the practitioner with various siddhis or psy&c/ sensory powers that have been lost through neglect. Many yogis15 warn against practicing kundalini yoga without a teacher and without extensive practice in hatha yoga. This is because the kundalini energy may encounter impurities and psy- chic blockages in the subtle body as it flows upward. The fiery energy of the kundalini tries to burn its way through such obsta- cles. If too much obstruction is experienced, the \"serpent force\" may induce extreme physical and mental repercussions as the blocks are removed. A far safer method of working with the chakras is to simply visu- alize them with the aura and contemplate their various attributes. Chakra Awareness Many asana positions and breahg exercises are intended to purlfy and invigorate the chakras, removing any \"blocks\" from the subtle body.

Magical work involves change and creation. And the subject of the magician's work is the selJ The magician is the focus of his or her own alchemical processes. By adapting one's personal vision to reflect the macrocosm, we can change ourselves to better reflect those divine ideas. We may alter our body, appearance, the chemi- cal composition of our blood, and the configuration of our nervous system. We may tame the feral beasts that dwell within our organic structure. By changing ourselves to resonate with the divine, we may transmute every portion of ourselves and become as purified vessels for the eternal spirit. Rites such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram rep- resent this spiritual goal. The LBRP explains this goal in mathe- matical and Qabalistic terms. It sets a pattern for self-growth whch has a powerful influence on the subconscious mind. It symbolically places us in a correct relationship to the one divine source. And when we are in this correct relationship, it becomes much easier for us to fight off any hostile influence from within or from without. By continued practice of rituals such as the LBRP, we can produce the physical and astral conditions which will make it easier for us to realize our true place in the divine universe. The pentagram is a symbol of the logos or the word of creation, which connects the essential divine self in humanity to the one divine self called God."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Formula of the LBRP The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is the ceremonial magician's way of casting a circle of protection. Some Wiccan groups will cast a circle around their sacred space by tracing it on the ground with a sword, or by sprinkling salt water around the area. But the ceremonial magician does this by tracing pentagrams around the circle with a specialized dagger or wand. The ritual begins with a brief moment of meditation to cleanse the mind and begin the process of creating a ritual atmosphere or sacred space. Then the magician performs what is called the Qabal- istic Cross. Ths rite creates a cross of living divine light within the magician's aura. This cross is based upon the Qabalistic Tree of Life, containing the spheres of Kether, Malkuth, Geburah, Chesed, and Tiphareth. These also represent a balancing of the four elements within the magician's aura: Kether / air, Malkuth/ earth, Geburahl fire, and Chesed or Gedulah/water. And although the name of Tiphareth is not vibrated, the balancing element of spirit is indicated by placing the hands over the heart area. After the Qabalistic Cross, the magician traces the Lesser Ban- ishing Pentagram in all four quarters, beginning in the east and walking clockwise. The symbol of the pentagram refers to the four elements-crowned and completed by the fifth element of spirit. The pentagram is a symbol of protection. When traced, the penta- grams are visualized in flaming astral blue or white light. They are charged by stabbing through the center of the figure when the appropriate Hebrew words are vibrated. The pentagrams are con- nected to each other by an astral ribbon of the same color. Drawing these banishing pentagrams rids the area of all unwanted energies. The magician returns to the east, and stands with arms extended in the form of the cross. He identifies himself with the Tau cross of life, a symbol of knowledge gained through sacrifice, but which is also related to the ideas of mercy and justice. Next comes the invocation of the four archangels. These archangels are associated with the idea of the divine creator govern- ing the four elements and the four directions. Angels and archangels are considered specific aspects of God, each with a particular purpose"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Pentagram 179 and jurisdiction. They are humanized symbols of what we believe to be good and holy. Nearly all of the Hebrew angelic names end in the suffixes \"el\" or \"yah.\" This indicates that they are \"of God.\" Raphael, \"the Healer of God,\" is assigned to air. Gabriel, \"the Strong One of God,\" is assigned to water. Michael, \"He who is like God,\" is assigned to fire. Uriel, \"the Light of God,\" is assigned to earth.3 While the pentagrams are drawn for the purification of the cir- cle, the archangels are invoked to consecrate the circle with the forces of the divine light. Before me, RAPHAEL, behind me, GABRIEL, on my right hand, IMICHAEL, on my left hand, URIEL. Then comes the statement, \"For about me flame the Penta- grams, and in the column shines the Six-rayed Star.\" (Refer to Chapter Three, Endnote 20.) The six-rayed star is the hexagram or \"Star of David,\" whch is the star of the macrocosm or \"greater uni- verse.\" It is formed from the two triangles of fire and water, and it symbolizes perfection and total balance. While the pentagram is the symbol of man, the hexagram is the symbol of perfected or purified man, balanced withn the greater universe. Trus is followed once again by the Qabalistic Cross, whch further strengthens and seals the cross of light within the magician's aura. Origins of the Pentagram Ritual The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram was a creation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. However, various portions of the ritual are found to have far more ancient sources. In the New Testament, the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13) is obviously based upon Qabalistic principles, showing that Jesus of Nazareth, who was called Rabbi by his followers, knew his Qabalah. This is because the Lord's Prayer is itself based on the Hebrew \"Prayer of David\" from the Old Testament, found in the first book of Chronicles 29:l. \"The Prayer of David at the Founda- tion of the Temple\" reads as follows: Unto Thee, 0 Tetragrammaton, are the Greatness and the Power and the Beauty and the Victo y and the Glo y,"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"for unto Thee is everything in the Heavens and the Earth. Unto Thee, 0 Tetragrammaton, is the Kingdom. Ths single verse mentions the names of several Sephiroth, including: Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Malkuth. The Lord's Prayer from the New Testament states: For thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory, forever and ever, Amen.4 This is only slightly different from the Qabalistic Cross, which states (in English): Thou art the Kingdom and the Power and the Glo y, the World forever, unto the ages. Amen. The word Atah (\"Thou art\") is linked to the Sephrah of Kether, whose divine name is \"I am.\" Malkuth (\"the Kingdom\") is the tenth sphere on the Tree. V'geburah (\"and the Power\") refers to the fifth Sephirah of power. V'gedulah, whch means \"and the Glory,\" refers to Chesed since \"Glory\" (or \"Magnificence\") is another title of Chesed. Le-Olahm, Amen means \"forever unto the ages.\" 72~s is very similar to the Chstian Sign of the Cross. One impor- tant difference between the Christian Cross and the Qabalistic Cross is that in the Hermetic version, Geburah or \"the Power\" is attributed to the right shoulder, while in the Chstian Cross, it is placed on the left shoulder. Tlus points out a major difference in the way that a cer- emonial magician approaches the divine self from the way that the average church-goer and the Chstian Rosicrucian approaches God. With the Judeo-Chstian tradition, the image of God is seen as separate and outside of humanity. The image of God, as projected on the Tree of Life, is usually viewed as something \"out there,\" or some- thmg that is too sacred to be approached by sinful earthbound human beings. Thus the Tree of Life as the image of God is sometimes pictured as the backside of God by the orthodox religions. In other words, God's face is not turned toward humanity, or as the scriptures tell us, \"one cannot look upon the face of God and live.\" It was safer to \"image\" the deity from behmd. Therefore to the Roman Catholic, Geburah is on the left shoulder-the same as the image of the Tree seen from the back, and outside of the human being."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Pentagram 181 One Qabalistic diagram often used to illustrate the idea of the divine on the Tree of Life is that of Adam Kadmon, the so-called Atzi- luthic or archetypal man. Adam Kadmon is the \"heavenly man\" or '%ody of God.\" He is the divine prototype of humanity which is cir- cumscribed upon the Tree of Life. The crown of Kether is above his head, Malkuth is at his feet, Geburah is at his left shoulder, and Chesed is at hs right shoulder. In hs book Kabbalah: Tradition of Hid- den Knowledge, Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi tells us about the diagram of Adam Kadmon: \". . . ths reflection, however, like that in any mirror, is only a refection and never the reality.\"5 Halevi says: The likeness of a man (Ezekiel 1:26) zuas used by early nzystics to describe the Divine Glory. The figure of a prinzordial, Atziluthic man, God's image is the embodiment of the Sefirot. This, the most perfect image of Divinity, is seen not as God but as His reflection, and therefore a representation of his does not contravene the Second Commandment.6 Adam Kadmon is sometimes called the \"Reversed Tree.\" This is because several glyphs of the Tree of Life are shown with their \"roots\" in the Supernals. Adam Kadmon is \"reversed\" from this, with this head in Kether and his feet in Malkuth. We also believe that he is the \"Reversed Tree\" because his image is reversed not only from top to bottom, but from side to side. If you hold the usual image of Adam Kadmon (see Figure 10, p. 182) up to a mirror you will see what we believe is the true non-reversed appearance of the deity that it is forbidden by the orthodoxy to look upon-Geburah is on the right side, Chesed is on the left. Therefore, the traditional diagram of Adam Kadmon is a tzelem or reflected image of a spiritual reality-not that reality itself. Ceremonial magicians are not bound by the admonishments of orthodoxy whch state that one cannot view God from the front, or look upon hs non-reversed image.

(See Figure 11, p. 184.) Commenting on the Qabalistic Cross in hs book Transcendental Magic, Eliphas Levi, the man most responsible for the occult revival of the nineteenth century,, wrote that: \"This Sign, made after ths manner, should precede and terminate the Conjuration of the Four.\"8 The Conjuration of the Four refers to the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth. The four archangels in the LBRP are among the best known and most powerful of the Hebrew deities, and they are the governors of the four elements. The invocation of the archangels in the LBRP is very similar to an invocation in a Hebrew Night Prayer printed in an orthodox Siddur or Daily Prayer Book translated by Philip Birnbaum.9 The Siddur reads as follows: In the name ofthe Lord God of Israel, may Michael be at my right hand, and Gabriel at my Eefl; before me Uriel; behind me Raphael; and above my head the Divine Presence. %s clearly relates very closely to the calling of the archangels in the LBRP. Although they are in a different order, they are still the same archangels, carrying out the same duties. These orthodox cor- respondences may reflect an approach that is different from that taken by the Golden Dawn. There are undoubtedly similar versions of the invocation of the archangels still tucked away in Hebrew texts. What the Pentagram Represents No one knows the exact magical origins of the pentagram, or pen- talpha, as it is sometimes called in older texts. For centuries the five- pointed star has been used as a symbol of protection and a talisman for health and well-being. It was popular among the Babylonians, Egyptians, Assyrians, and Hebrews. According to Eliphas Levi, magicians of old used to draw the symbol upon their doorsteps, to keep malevolent spirits out and beneficent spirits in. And as early as the sixth century B.c.E., Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher-mystic, used the pentagram as a holy symbol for his followers. Five was a number peculiarly associated with the ideas of mar- riage and union, as it is the first number beyond the monad formed from the union of the first odd and even numbers, male and"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Figure 11: Backing into the Tree."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Pentagram 185 female. It is also said to represent the human figure, with arms and legs outspread. The shape of the five-pointed star seems to be one of nature's favorite geometric designs-it can be found in flowers, fruit, and crystalline forms. In magic the pentagram represents the four ele- ments of fire, water, air, and earth-plus one other. In addition, the number five is attributed to the Pentagrammaton or \"five-lettered name.\" This is a natural extension of the Tetra- grammaton, the holy and hidden \"four-lettered name\" of God~sig- nified by the letters YHVH (717'). In the Pentagrammaton the letter Slun is placed in the center of YHVH, resulting in the name of Yeheshuah-YHShVH (71IU7'). This is the name of Jesus in Hebrew, but more importantly to magicians, it is the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth, with the addition of the fifth element of spirit. The element of spirit binds together and governs the other four, which are the metaphysical building blocks of all that exists. The fifth element of spirit, also called the quintessence, crowns and connects the other four. It is spirit which transcends the others and makes the whole of the pentagram greater than the sum of its parts. Spirit is the divine and guiding principle. This is one reason magicians stress that it is important to keep the spirit point of the pentagram facing upward. To reverse it would be to subject spirit to the governance of matter. Thus the inverted pentagram signifies chaos and evil. Levi states that: The Pentagram signifies the domination of the mind over the elements, and the demons of air, the spirits of fire, the phantoms of water and ghosts of earth are enchained by this sip.10 Elsewhere Levi reiterates that \"The elementary spirits are sub- servient to this sign when employed with understanding ....\"I1 He continues: If it be asked how a sign can exercise so much power over spirits, we inquire in turn why the Christian world bows before the Sign of the Cross. The sign is nothing by itself and has no force apart from the doctrine of which it is the summary and the logos. Now a sign which summarizes, in their expression, all the occult forces of Nature, a sign which has ever exhibited to elementary spirits and others a power greater than their own, fills them naturally with respect and fear, enforcing their obedience by the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"empire of science and of will over ignorance and weakness. By the Penta- gram is also measured the exact proportions of the great and unique Athanor necessary to the confection of Philosophical Stone and of the Great Work. The most perfect alembic in which the Quintessence can be elaborated is conformable to this figure, and the Quintessence itself is represented by the Sign of the Pentagram.l2 Here Levi gives us clues about the numerical dimensions of the pentagram, for by it is \"measured the exact proportions\" of the athanor, the alchemical oven which is used to obtain the Philosopher's Stone-a symbol for spiritual illumination and expanded consciousness. What is so important about the propor- tions of the pentagram? Through the number five, the number of points on this figure, the pentagram is connected to the sphere of Geburah on the Tree of Life, and to its corresponding planet, Mars. The pentagram repre- sents that fiery, purifying power of the divine that takes the name of Pachad or \"fear,\" one of the titles of Geburah, whose other pri- mary title is \"strength.\" Another higher function of Geburah is that of Din meaning \"justice,\" \"judgment,\" or \"severity.\" The divine name of Geburah is Elohim Gibor or \"God of Battles.\" According to Iamblichus, a Neoplatonic philosopher-magician of the fourth cen- tury c.E., \"The pentad is highly expressive of justice, and justice comprehends all the other virtues.\"l3 In his book Numbers, Their Occult Power and Mystic Virtues, W. Wynn Westcott states that the pentad is called \"the Unconquered.\" Westcott also states: Proclus on Hesiod gives two reasons for its semblance to Justice, \"because it punishes wrong, and takes away inequality of possession, and also equalizes what is less, to benefit. \"14 Thus the number five provides us with the ideas of fear, strength, severity power, and justice. The awesome energy of Geburah can strike fear into the minds of negative powers and those who do not understand its harsh, purifying, and equilibrating power. Eliphas Levi tells us that the pentagram is a potent sign that extends its power over the elementary intelligences that inhabit the astral realms: The Pentagram.. .exercises a great influence upon spirits and terrifies phantoms.15"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Pentagram 287 However, to the magician who uses it with a divine intent, the pentagram is a potent symbol of strength and justice. The pentagram has always been misunderstood and feared by those who do not comprehend its sacred meaning: We proceed to the explanation and consecration of the Sacred and Mys- terious Pentagram. At this point, let the ignorant and superstitious close the book; they will either see nothing but darkness, or they will be scandalized. The Pentagram, which in the Gnostic schools is called the Blazing Star, is the sign of intellectual omnipotence and autocracy. It is the Star ofthe Magi; it is the Word madejlesh. ..The Sign of the Penta- gram is also the sign of the Microcosm, and it represents what the Kabalists of the book Zohar term the Microprosopus. The complete com- prehension of the Pentagram is the key of the two worlds. It is absolute philosophy and natural science.l6 As will be seen, all Mysteries of Magic, all symbols of the Gnosis, allfig- ures of occultism, all kabalistic keys of prophesy are summed up in the Sign of the Pentagram, which Paracelsus proclaims to be the greatest and most potent of all signsn17 Gematria of the Pentagram One way to study the pentagram is through the use of gematria or Hebrew numerology that is concerned with the numerical value of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.18 Words and images that have the same value are thought to be related. By its number, five, the penta- gram is connected to Geburah and to the Hebrew letter Heh (7), a symbol of creative power. Through the letter Heh, the pentagram becomes a symbol of intuition and understanding. But it is also a symbol of sight, which is the sense attributed to Heh. Therefore it is the magical symbol of true vision. The letter Heh is also connected with the sign of Aries, the warrior-protector, and the tarot card of \"The Emperor,\" who is the ruler and executor of the divine law. In human physiology, Aries is especially referred to the head (symbol- ized by the uppermost point of spirit in the pentagram). Aries is ruled by Mars and its exaltation is the Sun, the symbolic source of all light. Tlus again leads us to ideas of strength and protection through the warrior energy of Mars-Aries, as well as solar light and health."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Another word associated through gematria with the number five is bahbah (XII), meaning \"gate.\" The Fifth Key of the tarot is the card of \"The Hierophant,\" who is the teacher, the expounder of the mysteries, and the channel for spiritual instruction. There are other numbers associated with this figure as well. Refer to the diagram of the pentagram and its enclosing pentagon (see Figure 12, p. 189). The pentagon is a figure that is implied, if not actually traced, when drawing a pentagram. In length every line of the pentagon is composed of thrteen units. The number thirteen is associated with a multitude of occult references: twelve spheres are needed to surround a central (thirteenth) sphere; Moses and the twelve tribes of Israel; Jesus and the twelve apostles; the sun and the twelve signs of the zodiac. In addition, many important Qabal- istic words have the numerical value of thrteen, including achad (YilK), \"unity\" and ahavah (717K), \"love.\" Other words tied to this number include gahah (TI]), \"healing\" or \"health; ziv (lT), \"glory\"; and hegeh (717), \"to separate,\" or \"to imagine.\" The Thrteenth Key of the tarot is titled \"Death,\" and it is attrib- uted to Scorpio, transformation, and change. The Thrteenth Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, an important Qabalistic text, corresponds to the tarot card of \"The High Priestess\" and is attributed to the Moon. Ths path is the primary conduit by which the higher, divine conscious- ness flows down to lower levels. It is also a path of change. Interestingly, thirteen multiplied by two is twenty-six, the value of YHVH (7137) and kabedh (712) \"to honor.\" The Twenty-sixth Path of the Sepher Yetzirah is attributed to the tarot card of \"The Devil,\" to which is assigned the powers of material force and generation. Thirteen multiplied by three is thrty-nine, the value of YHVH Achad ('Tilt4 71;T7) or \"YHVH is One.\" Thuteen multiplied by four is fifty-two, the number of YHVH spelled 0ut.19 It is also the value of Aima (Kt37K), the Supernal Mother and Ben (11), the Reconciling Son. Finally, thirteen multiplied by five (the number of Gnes that comprise the pentagon) is sixty-five, the number associated with Adonai (737K). It is also the number formed by the Latin letters for \"lightu-LVX (L = 50, V = 5, X = 10). The whole of the figure can be described as a sigil of the name of Adonai or the light of LVX."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Pentagram 189 Sixty-five is also the number associated with the Hebrew words hekel (bn), meaning \"temple or palace\" (the Zohar tells us that Adonai is the palace of YHVH); has (b?), \"to be silent,\" dumiah (n9i317), \"silence\"; and gam yechad ('In' ?X), \"together in unity.\" The long segment of each line of the pentagram is eight units in length. The number eight corresponds to the Sephirah of Hod, the sphere of intellect, communication, words of power, and magic. It also corresponds to the Hebrew letter Cheth (n) which means \"fence or enclosure,\" pointing to further protective qualities. The Eighth Key of the tarot is titled \"Strength,\"-it is a fiery path which leads to the sphere of Geburah. Through gematria, the number eight is associated with the word agad (TM) \"to bind.\" The shorter segment of each line of the pentagram is five units in length, affirming once again the same ideas stated above. The actual pentagram is composed of five lines which are each twenty-one units in length. The Twenty-first Key of the tarot is called \"The Universe,\" and it is the completion of cosmic manifes- tation. Twenty-one is the value of Eheieh (VnN), the divine name of Kether. Eheieh is one of the highest names that is associated with the act of creation.

In addition, the mystic number of Tiphareth is twenty-one. The total length of all lines on the pentagram (twenty-one mul- tiplied by five) is 105, which is formed by adding all the numbers from one to fourteen. The Fourteenth Key of the tarot is \"Temper- ance,\" the card of the HGA or higher self. The Fourteenth Path of the Sepher Yetzirah is attributed to Daleth (1), the \"door\" of initia- tion. Fourteen is also a number associated with the Hebrew words atad (TUN), \"thorn, the piercer\"; debach (Hll), \"sacrifice\"; gaye (RYI), \"rising earth\"; dai (?'I), \"abundance\"; david (lll), \"beloved; habhab (lnln), \"sacrificial offering\"; hadah (Tl?), \"to direct with the hand\"; yod (T), \"hand\"; and zahav (l7T), \"gold.\" Other words associated with the number 105 are hepek (>97), \"to change or transform\"; pekeh (i7>9), \"to flow or pour forth; and tziyah20 (713), \"to glow, to burn or to glitter.\" So what does all this mean? In tracing a pentagram, the magi- cian invokes the power of Eheieh. This is a glittering, glorious power that pours forth abundantly; pierces and binds all negativ- ity; encloses and separates the pure from the impure; opens and closes gates or doors between different worlds; gives rise to medi- tation, visions, love, unity, and healing; and to the magician who silences the chatter of his mind, sacrifices his lower desires, and aligns hmself with the divine will, it can be employed with justice as a potent force for transformation, generation, and change (par- ticularly on the material or earth plane) which can be directed by the hand and used to obtain spiritual \"gold.\" Through the number five (the creative Heh, and the five elements), Eheieh, as asserted through the tracing of a pentagram, is an expression of the five-fold existence of the power of the divine self and the light (LVX) of Adonai, who is the palace of YHVH. It is that which created the cosmos and which rules over it with justice and strength, permeat- ing every aspect of creation. Everything in the universe is com- posed of the one true selfwhich is both the power that transforms and the object of the transformation.21"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Pentagram 191 Divine Hebrew Names Associated with the LBRP The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is said to be most effective in the Qabalistic realm of Assiah-the physical, active world that is associated with the tenth Sephirah of Malkuth. This is the realm in which we live and function. Malkuth is said to con- tain the four elements of the manifest universe. This is why in many drawings, Malkuth is shown divided into four sections. The sub-elements are: air of Malkuth, water of Malkuth, fire of Malkuth, and earth of Malkuth. But for our purposes it would be better to refer to them simply as air, fire, water, and earth-the ele- ments of our physical plane. With respect to the entire Tree of Life, Malkuth is the only Sephirah to which is assigned the element of earth. This is why the banishing earth pentagram22 in particular is used throughout the LBRP. However, in this instance it would be better to refer to the pentagram used in this ritual as the lesser banishing pentagram to avoid confusion.23 All of the divine Hebrew names intoned in the Lesser Banish- ing Ritual of the Pentagram are composed of four letters. And the specific names used are attributed to the four sub-elements of Malkuth. The name of YHVH, the Tetragrammaton, is vibrated after the pentagram is drawn in the east, the direction attributed to elemental air. Tradition tells us that YHVH is a symbol for the high- est, most divine name of God. Therefore it is appropriate that this name is vibrated in the east, the place of the dawning of the light. YHVH is our sunrise, our source of life. The east symbolizes elemental air which has further correspon- dences with Mercury the highest of the three alchemical principles. Alchemists often refer to Mercury as spirit. All of this is in keeping with the idea of the \"hghest name of God.\" Adonai, meaning \"lord,\" is the name vibrated after the figure is traced in the south. This name is particularly associated with Malkuth, whose complete divine name is Adonai ha-Aretz. The name \"lord carries with it connotations of hgh rank, especially power, rulershp, and dominion.24 Here the name is associated with fire and the south, the direction of the sun's greatest strength. Ths is"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"192 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND ~GIC a reminder that here on Malkuth, our immediate symbolic link with the lord of light and strength is through the life-giving rays of the sun. The name of E,heieh is vibrated after the western pentagram is drawn. Eheieh, meaning \"I am,\" is the divine name of Kether. The west is the place of sunset, the completion of the sun's journey across the sky. It represents rest and peace. To the ancient Egyp- tians, Ra, the Sun god died each night when he entered Amentet (the west). The west is a symbol of the completion of the soul's journey and the goal of spiritual growth. Therefore the west is an emblem of Kether, the goal which we seek throughout our incarna- tion on earth and which we hope to reach at the end of life, when we (like Ra) journey to Amentet. The name Eheieh vibrated in the west suggests that the goal of all esoteric work is the magician's complete identification with the true and eternal self of Kether. After the northern pentagram is drawn, the word Agla is vibrated. This is not really a word but rather a notariqon whch uses the first letter of each word in a sentence to form a single word. In this case the sentence from which Agla is formed is Atah Gebur Le-Olam Adonai. Ths means, \"Thou art great forever, my Lord,\" which is a powerful invocation--clearly calling upon all the might of Adonai to aid and guide us through the darkness of things unknown. Agla is vibrated in the north because that is the direction of the greatest sym- bolic cold, darkness, shadow, illusion, and the unfamiliar. It is \"the place of Forgetfulness, Dumbness (silence), and Necessity and of the greatest symbolical Darknessku25 It represents all the dormant and unmanifested forces of the universe, as well as those which are hid- den or veiled to us. These are forces which we are largely ignorant of. However, all things, manifest or unmanifest (light or dark), exist then, now, and always under the rulership of Adonai. This we affirm by the phrase \"Thou art great forever, my Lord!\" How to Draw a Perfect Pentagram Refer to Figure 13, p. 194, the diagram of the pentagram.26 1.

Uses of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram In addition to its psychotherapeutic uses, this simple yet powerful cleansing ritual can be used as a protection against the impure magnetism of others. It is also a method for getting rid of negative thoughts or emotional distress. As a magician, you can make a mental image of a particular thought or disturbance and visualize it before you. One way of doing this is to project it out of your aura with the Projection Sign of a Neophyte (also called the the Attacking Sign; see Figure 14, p. 198). When the unwanted energy is away from you, you can pre- vent its return with the Sign of Silence (or the Sign of Protection). Then imagine the negative form in the east and perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. See the form dissolving on the outside of your ring of flaming pentagrams.

Then walk back and stand behind your physical body and let your astral body be reabsorbed. In the beginning of one's magical training, the LBRP is to be per- formed daily for no less than a period of six months. In fact, it should be practiced daily by any magician no matter how long one has been doing the work. Some Golden Dawn and Stella Matutina manu- scripts suggested doing the invoking form of this Ritual in the morning and the banishing form at night. However, we feel that the beginner needs to concentrate only on the banishing form.27 Beginners have a tendency to have their auras light up on the astral-they unknow- ingly attract all kinds of elementals at ths early stage of the work. It's far more important for the beginner to know how to banish rather than to invoke. Anyone can attract an elemental or energy form. Getting rid of it can be more difficult.

EGYPTIAN BANISHING RITUALS Alternative Versions The student may choose to replace the pentagram in the above ritual with symbols that retain a more Egyptian character. Rather than trac- ing the pentagram in the four quarters, the magician could draw the sign of the ankh or the wedjat (the Eye of Horus). Both were consid- ered powerful amulets for protection. The ankh is the symbol of eter- nal life, while the wedjat is the symbol for health, wholeness, protection, and general well-being. (See Figure 14, p. 198.) To trace the ankh in the air before you, start on the left side at the point where the circle meets the crossbar and, drawing in a clockwise motion, trace the circular \"head\" of the ankh. Next, trace the shaft of the ankh, leading from the middle of the crossbar to the lowest point of the shaft. Finally, start at the left point of the cross- bar and move straight across to the right point of the crossbar. To trace the Eye of Horus in the air before you, start at the left point of the eyebrow line and trace clockwise. Next, trace the out- line of the eye itself, starting from the left and proceeding clockwise, around the pupil, and back around the bottom of the eyelid, ending at the left side of the eye near the starting point.

Atah is the more correct Hebrew pronunciation of this word than the tradi- tional pronunciation of Atoh used by magicians in the past. 2. For the Qabalistic Cross the magician may choose to stand either in the east- ern part of the room or in the center of the room, facing east. For the drawing of the first pentagram, however, the magician should walk to the eastern part of the room and move to the southern, western, and northern portion of the temple as required for the tracing of the pentagrams. For the Invocation of the Archangels and the final Qabalistic Cross, the magician can again move to the center of the room. If the temple space is very small, the magician can simply stand in the center of the room throughout the entire ritual and turn toward the quarters to trace the pentagrams. 3. Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael are the three archangels that are most often cited in the Bible. The Bahir, an important Qabalistic text, lists the three major angels as Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel (see The Bahir translated by Aryeh Kaplan, page 41). Uriel also figures prominently in non-canonical lore, but in some texts, Uriel is confused or replaced with Phanuel. One of the most important magical texts used by magicians, Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, published in 1531, lists Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel as the \"the four princes of the angels, which are set over the four winds, and over the four parts of the world.\" (Refer to page 533 of the Llewellyn edition, edited by Donald Tyson.) 4.

It may well be the finest method created for such a purpose. The basic introductory for- mula of the Middle Pillar can be easily adapted into a variety of exercises with varying levels of complexity and spiritual devel- opment. This simple yet potent exercise is the foundation of a diverse number of magical techniques, and it can be layered with a virtually endless number of correspondences, leading to ever more complex ceremonies. A number of such rites are given in this chapter. There are also Egyptian, Greek, Gaelic, and Shamanic renditions, as well as several exercises for healing.

Make sure the power is circulating away from the centers and the result will be that you have formed around you an aura by the power issuing up the shaft. 4. In the circulation of the fountain, the power goes up the cen- ters. Then with the exhalation down the left side, and the ~nhalation up the right side, exhale down the front of the body, inhale up the back of the body. Ths will cause the aura to be in a subtle state of great activity, the light pouring through and making it a great and dynamic power. 5. Close with the OSIRIS Godform.

Its color is whte, and its divine name will be AHIH [or EHEIEH] (YTYYTK), and AGLA (8538). You will vibrate these names in the usual way and concentrate on the white light. After a few minutes when you feel the white light has been aroused and you feel it vibrating, then recite the Invocation, and in the last sentence whch says, \"Let the whte brilliance of the"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 217 spirit descend!\" you will vibrate the four Enochian names: EXARP, BITOM, NANTA, and HCOMA. These names should equilibrate the white light. Part II: Air A Then see the shaft come down in the skull in the usual way into the neck, and in the neck you form another ball that extends all the way through the throat and neck, and this time you will see it colored yellow, whch is the color of Air. See in ths ball the Kerubic Sign of Aquarius. Then you say the Prayer of the Sylphs. You visualize the light in yellow. Superimposed on that sphere in its absolute com- plement of purple you see the two lines of the symbol of Aquarius (z). You are to see these lines inside the yellow in purple color, and you vibrate: YOD-HEH-VAV-HEH (7177). Follow it with the archangel: RAPHAEL (5851) and the angel CHASSAN (1Wi-l). When you feel the ball is alive and real, and you can feel spiritual power pouring through it, then say the Prayer of the Sylphs. Part III: Fire A See your shaft descend once more to the solar plexus, or just above the end of the sternum, the little breast bone. See the ball extend- ing from front to back-a big ball of red fire, a brilliant flaming red. See the shaft in white and the balls in different colors. The color of this center is red. This is the sphere of Fire. I want you to see inside the center of this ball the symbol of Leo (62) in emerald green, and vibrate the name: ELOHIM (0775~). Then your archangel: MICHAEL (5K37?3) and the angelic name: ARAL (5~1~). Vibrate the names, and when you feel their power start on the Prayer of the Salamanders. Part W: Water V The shaft descends once more to the region of the hps, the genera- tive region, and there you will see another ball formed. Ths time it will be in a very lovely ultramarine blue. When you have this sphere formed in blue, visualize inside this sphere the symbol of Scorpio (TI+) in orange. Ths is the sphere of Water. Then you vibrate the name of EL (5~). Then vibrate your archangelic name:"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"GABRIEL (5~71~1) and your angelic name: TALIHAD (777%). Then the Prayer of the Undines. Part V: Earth B Then your shaft goes down again to the feet, and forms again in the feet another ball. The usual color of the element of Earth is black. But since it is difficult to get a complement color of black, I am going to give you indigo. Superimposed on this will be the symbol of Taurus (5) in a very light yellow, the complement of indigo. The divine name is ADONAI (737N) which you vibrate. Then vibrate the archangelic name: AURIEL (5~711~) and the angelic name: PHORLAKH (7~5115). That will be followed by the Pfayer of the Gnomes. Part VI: Circumambulation Here you have five balls on the central sphere. When you get down to the feet, stop and see this shaft with the five balls all glowing, then start what I call the Fovmula of Civcumambulation; but the first method is to be the Fountain. See all the power in the feet center and then see it rush up from the feet center like the water in a foun- tain. As this power rushes up see it take away all the power from all the other spheres on its ascent to the top, so that you can imag- ine as it goes from ball to ball, it takes all the power out from each sphere in turn until it gets to the white light; then visualize it draw- ing up the power of the different centers so it will be a combination of all the colors from indigo up. See the sense of power rather than the literal sense of color. See it. You circulate power from the different balls until it is a fountain. Make sure the power is circulating away from the centers. The result will be that you will have formed around you an aura by the circulation of power issuing up through the shaft. Then follow with the other two methods. The circulation down the left side and up the right, and the circulation from the head down the front of the body, under the feet and up the back. Use the inhalation and exha- lation. The aura will be in a state of great activity. The light is pour- ing through and making it a great power. In order to close assume the godform of OSIRIS and keep that as long as you feel like it.

The image of the Tree of Life is reflected into the human body (see Chapter Nine, pages 180-184) so that the practitioner faces the archetypal image of the Tree, which is in turn reflected behind him (see Figure 16 below).g Many more complex variations of the Five Pillar exercise are possible. This exercise is best performed either standing or sitting.

Flames, chalices, tools, gem- stones, geometric shapes, and a host of other images could be visu- alized as well. The only limit on the number and variety of ths exercise is the boundary of one's imagination. Consecration of Talismans One of the most unique methods of using the Middle Pillar exercise that was developed by Regardie was as a tool for consecrating tal- ismans. This method requires that the magician first activate the spheres within his or her body. Then, employing mental focus and rhythmic breathing, the magician can charge the talisman by transferring the invoked energy into the talisman. Talismans ded- icated to a specific purpose can be \"fine-tuned\" by projecting energy from the corresponding Sephirah (and its appropriate color) within the body. Healing Rituals It can be said that the Middle Pillar exercise is by its very nature a ritual for self-healing. Regular performance of this ritual, like the practice of the Relaxation Rites previously mentioned, can help alleviate the neuro-muscular tensions that lead to more serious ill- nesses. This exercise can also be used to heal others as well. Regardie discovered that he could project healing energy to his patients by performing the Middle Pillar exercise beforehand. Keep in mind, however, that this should only be attempted by experi- enced practitioners. Don't rush into becoming \"a healer\" without"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"238 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND MAGIC first becoming proficient in the various preliminary techniques of relaxation, the LBRP, and the Middle Pillar. Magical methods of healing, like other forms of theurgy, involve a type of auto-hypnosis, wherein the magician is totally focused on the goal of the operation. It also employs the manipula- tion and movement of energies. Usually, the healer extends energy to the recipient, where it works to remove psychic blockages, energy imbalances, or physical injuries / illnesses. The healer must be able to manipulate the subtle bodies of two people-his or her own and that of the recipient. Therefore it is crucial that the practi- tioner be psychically sound and balanced. If not, there is a danger that 1) the healer will absorb the psychic \"ailment\" of the recipient, or 2) the healer's own imbalanced energies will be absorbed by the recipient, making matters worse. In the Golden Dawn, magicians were warned: It is better at first to keep your aura to yourse2f, rather than to try to flow out towards others. Unless you are particularly vital and well-bal- anced, you will only waste energy. So-called modes of healing and of 'doing good to others' should be eschewed for a time. Such methods have a technique of their own and require trained and balanced minds and bodies to carry them out. Get yourse2fright before you attempt to inter- fere with others.. . .30 This advice is as sound today as it was a century ago. A MIDDLE PILLAR HEALING RITUAL Place two chairs in the middle of the room, one for you and one for the recipient. (Tlus can be done with or without the recipient being in the room with you.) Perform the LBRP. Instruct the recipient to sit facing you, holding both of your hands in a relaxed and recep- tive manner, with eyes closed. You (the healer) then perform the basic Middle Pillar exercise. The names may be intoned verbally or silently. The recipient may also vibrate the names if he or she wants, but you are in control of guiding all visualizations and vibrations. The main point is that"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"The Middle Pillar Exercise 239 you are awakening the spheres within yourseZJ in order that you may then use this energy to heal the recipient. When the energies of the Middle Pillar have been fully acti- vated with you, visualize within yourself the red sphere of Gebu- rah in the area of your right shoulder. Silently vibrate the divine name of Geburah, \"Elohim Gibor.\" (At this point the recipient should merely be receptive and should not vibrate or attempt to activate his or her Geburah center.) Once you have established the sphere of Geburah within your sphere of sensation, project a red ray of light from Geburah to your Tiphareth center. Then project the red ray from Tiphareth to the source of the ailment or infection. Visualize this ray purging the illness, purifying it with the fiery ray of Geburah.31 Visualize the source of the problem gradually being eliminated. When ths is accomplished, project a ray of healing yel- low light from your Tiphareth center to mend the affected area and begin the process of healing. As you do so, mentally vibrate the divine name of Tiphareth \"YHVH Eloah ve-Daath.\" Visualize health and vigor returning to the recipient. Close by vibrating (both you and the recipient) the divine names of the Middle Pillar Exercise for equilibrium. 4ariations of the Healing Ritual Version 1 Sit facing the recipient, but do not hold the recipient's hands. After establishing the Middle Pillar within yourself, hold your hand (whchever hand you favor)32 just in front of the affected area on the recipient. (Your other hand may be placed on your Tiphareth center.) If needed, you may touch the affected area as you direct the red ray at it. Visualize the red ray being issued directly from Tiphareth toward the affliction or see it travel from Tiphareth down your arm to the source of the problem.

After establish- ing the Middle Pillar within yourself, establish it in the recipient by placing your hand(s) just in front of their corresponding spheres."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Version 3 Rather than using a red ray from Geburah, try using a blue ray from the watery sphere of Chesed to wash away the source of infection and cleanse the area. Version 4 Visualize your own inner Sephiroth in their King Scale colors.33 Your Geburah will be orange, and your Tiphareth will be rose pink. Their corresponding rays of light will also be projected in these col- ors. The recipient's Sephroth can be visualized in the Queen Scale colors (their usual colors) or simply whte. Version 5 Incorporate massage therapy into the exercise. Have the recipient lie down (face up or face down) on a massage table or on a blanket on the floor. Walk the recipient through one of the relaxation tech- niques given earlier but combine it with healing massage tech- niques. Then, after establishng the Middle Pillar withn yourself, establish it in the recipient by placing your hands on the sphere centers of the person and applying a slight pressure.34 Charge the recipient's Sephiroth by silent vibration of the divine names. Pro- ject a white ray of light from your Tiphareth center (directly or through your hands) into each sphere to charge them. See these spheres in their usual Queen Scale colors or simply white. Then bring a ray of light from Geburah, in one of the appropriate colors mentioned above, into your Tiphareth center and project it into the afflicted area with the usual visualizations. Visualize the source of the problem being eliminated. When this is accom- plished, project a ray of healing light from your Tiphareth center to mend the affected area and begin the process of healing.

Among Bennett's students were Dion For- tune and Aleister Crowley. Paul Foster Case applied these corre- spondences to form a system of invocation and healing which is still being taught by the Builders of the Adytum (BOTA). In the Golden Dawn system, four scales of color are used, each one assigned to the twelve astrological signs, the seven ancient planets, and the three most ancient elements. In Western music, the scale is divided into twelve semi-tones. Bennett assigned the twelve semi-tones of the chromatic scale (chroma is Greek for \"color\") to the twelve signs, beginning with the note C and the sign Aries. As each of the signs had a color associated to it, Bennett had, by ths process, derived colors for each of the musical notes as well. Since all the colors allotted to the planets and elements were included in the twelve colors of the rainbow associated with the signs, they were assigned notes based on color (in the King Scale of the Golden Dawn), thus:"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"244 THE BALANCE BETWEEN MIND AND ~GIC Color Note Sign Planet Element Red C Aries Mars Fire Red-Orange C# Taurus Orange D Gemini Sun Yellow-Orange D# Cancer Yellow E Leo Mercury Air Yellow-Green F Virgo Green F# Libra Venus Blue-Green G Scorpio Blue G# Sagittarius Moon Water Blue-Violet A Capricorn Saturn Violet A# Aquarius Jupiter Red-Violet B Pisces In the Golden Dawn system, the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet are each associated with a sign, planet, or ele- ment.

(See Figures 17-20 on the following pages.) I have chosen to set the music between mid- dle C and the B above it, dropping below middle C occasionally for melodic convenience. Wlrule I chose ths particular range arbitrarily and purely for the sake of convenience, I also enjoy the melodies it produces, and I have experienced their power both alone and in a for- mal ceremonial hall with a dozen experienced ceremonial Qabalists. It would be equally valid to use the twelve tones from G to the F# above it, for instance, or any other octave. If singing (chanting) the names as written here is too high or too low for your voice, don't transpose-reset the same notes beginning your octave at the comfortable bottom of your range. You will get a somewhat differ- ent but equally valid melody. In chanting the various words and names, sing one note for each Hebrew letter, regardless of the normal pronunciation of the word. The syllable you produce for each note is derived from the pure sound of the letter and the sound it has in context. For exam- ple: DThX is usually spelled and pronounced \"ElohimU-five let- ters are reduced to tWe syllables-in chanting this name, five letters get five syllables: \"Eh-lo-hay-ee-em.\" Hebrew is written right to left. Because music and English are both written left to right and need to be written parallel with the Hebrew letters, the Hebrew words are spelled backward-left to right-for example, Elohim: D1i7524 becomes ~5793. A single bar denotes the end of a word within a name contain- ing two or more words, whle a double bar denotes the end of a name, for example: Elohim / Gibor / /. Take a short inhalation at a single bar and a deep Inhalation at a double bar. All notes are written as whole notes. In practice, the notes should have equal or similar length and emphasis. Sing slowly and reverently. Smiling while you sing gives a sweeter tone to your voice and greater clarity and power to the words. \"Make a joyful noise unto 717' all ye hosts!\""},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Musical Setting for the QABALISTIC CROSS Malkuth a5~ln ve Geburah ve Gedulah 1-2 3 t 1 n 1-2 7 v 5 n ve-Ge bu oo ra ah ve-Ge du oo la ah le Olahm 5yt 5 a Le aa oh la am Amen na7 Ah mm en Figure 17: The Musical Qabalah: The Qabalistic Cross."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"LESSER RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM Divine and Archangelic Names YHVH '777 Yod He Vav He Adonai N73' Ah do na ee Eheieh N7'7 Eh he ee eh Agla N a 5 N Ah ga 11 ah Raphael 1 B N5 Ra ph ah el Gabriel a319N5 Ga bu rr ee ah el Michael D'2 N5 Mm ee ch ah el Auriel ~71~~5 Ah oh rr ee ah el Figure 18: The Musical Qabalah: The LBRl?"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"THE MIDDLE PILLAR Divine Names in Atziluth Eheieh YHVH Elohim ~n.8 n r n cc5n.p Eh he ee eh Yod He Vav He Eh lo he ee em YHVH Eloah ve-Daath n r n n5rn r~pn Yod He Vav He Eh lo oh ah ve- D aa ath Shaddai El Chai Adonai ha Aretz L~~~N~~~NYI~ n~iy Sha da ee Eh 11 cha ee Ah do na ee ha Ah re etz Figure 19: The Musical Qabalah: The Middle Pillar."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"DIVINE NAMES Attributed to The Sephiroth Eheieh Yah YHVHElohim Nn9n In .nrn N5n'P Eh he ee eh Ya ah Yod He Vav He Eh lo he ee em Elohirn Gibor Eh el Eh lo he ee em Gi bu oh or YHVH Eloah ve-Daath n i n ~5in r~pn Yod He Vav He Eh lo oh ah ve-Dd aa ath YHVH Tzabaoth Eloh Tzabaoth in x2Nin w5va x2Hin YHVH Tzbbahohth Ehloheeeem Tzbbahohoth Shaddai El Chai Adonai ha Aretz 7 ~579 N7j9 nNiy Sha da ee Eh ll cha ee Ah do na ee ha Ah re etz Figure 20: The Musical Qabalah: Divine Names."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY Abyss: A chasm or gulf whch separates the three Supernal Sephi- roth from the rest of the spheres on the Tree of Life.
