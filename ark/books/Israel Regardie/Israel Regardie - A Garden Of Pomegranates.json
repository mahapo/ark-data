Reams have been written about modern man's frenzied search for his soul-and. indeed, his doubt that he even has one at a time when, like castles built on sand, so many of his cherished theories, long mistaken for verities, are crumbling about his bewildered brain. The age-old advice, \"Know thyself,\" is more imperative than ever. The tempo of science has accelerated to such a degree that today's discoveries frequently make yesterday's equations obsolescent almost before they can be chalked up on a blackboard. Small wonder, then that every other hospital bed is occupied by a mental patient. Man was not constructed to spend his life at a crossroads, one of which leads he knows not where, and the other to threatened annihilation of his species. In view of this situation it is doubly reassuring to know that, even in the midst of chaotic concepts and conditions there still remains a door through which man, individually, can enter into a vast store-house of knowledge, knowledge as dependable and immutable as the measured tread of Eternity. For this reason I am especially pleased to be writing an introduction to a new edition of A Garden of Pomegranates. I feel that never, perhaps, was the need more urgent for just such a roadmap as the Qabalistic system provides. It should be equally useful to any who chooses to follow it, whether he be Jew, Christian or Buddhist, Deist, Theosophist, agnostic or atheist. The Qabalah is a trustworthy guide, leading to a comprehension both of the Universe and one's own Self."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ii A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES INTRODUCTION iii Sages have long taught that Man is a miniature of the Universe, containing within himself the diverse elements of that macrocosm of which he is the microcosm. Within the Qabalah is a glyph called the Tree of Life which is at once a symbolic map of the Universe in its major aspects, and also of its smaller counterpart, Man. Manly P. Hall, in The Secret Teachings of All Ages, deplores the failure of modern science to \"sense the profundity of these philosophical deductions of the ancients.\" Were they to do so, he says, they \"would realize those who fabricated the structure of the Qabalah possessed a knowledge of the celestial plan comparable in every respect with that of the modern savant.\" Fortunately many scientists in the field of psychotherapy are beginning to sense this correlation. In Francis G. Wickes' The Inner World of Choice reference is made to \"the existence in every person of a galaxy of potentialities for growth marked by a succession of personalogical evolution and interaction with environments.\" She points out that man is not only an individual particle but \"also a part of the human stream, governed by a Self greater than his own individual self.\" The Book .of the Law states simply, \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" This is a startling thought for those who considered a star a heavenly body, but a declaration SUbject to proof by anyone who will venture into the realm of his own Unconscious. This realm, he will learn if he persists, is not hemmed in by the boundaries of his physical body but is one with the boundless reaches of outer space. Those who, armed with the tools provided by the Qabalah, have made the journey within and crossed beyond the barriers of illusion, have returned with an impressive quantity of knowledge which conforms strictly to the definition of \"science\" in Winston's College Dictionary: \"Science: a body of knowledge, general truths of particular facts, obtained and shown to be correct by accurate observation and thinking; knowledge condensed, arranged and systematized with reference to general truths and laws.\" Over and over their findings have been confirmed, proving the Qabalah contains within it not only the elements of the science itself but the method with which to pursue it. When planning to visit a foreign country, the wise traveler will first familiarize himself with its language. In studying music, chemistry or calculus, a specific terminology is essential to the understanding of each SUbject. So a new set of symbols is necessary when undertaking a study of the Universe, whether within or without. The Qabalah provides such a set in unexcelled fashion. But the Qabalah is more. It also lays the foundation on which rests another archaic science-Magic. Not to be confused with the conjurer's sleight-of-hand, Magic has been defined by Aleister Crowley as \"the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.\" Dion Fortune qualifies this nicely with an added clause, \"changes in consciousness.\" The Qabalah reveals the nature of certain physical and psychological phenomena. Once these are apprehended, understood and correlated, the student can use the principles of Magic to exercise control over life's conditions and circumstances not otherwise possible. In short, Magic provides the practical application of the theories supplied by the Qabalah. It serves yet another vital function. In addition to the advantages to be gained from its philosophical application, the ancients discovered a very practical use for the literal Qabalah. Each letter of the Qabalistic alphabet has a number, color, many symbols and a Tarot card attributed to it. The Qabalah not only aids in an understanding of the Tarot, but teaches the student how to classify and organize all such ideas, numbers and symbols. Just as a knowledge of Latin will give insight into the meaning of an unfamiliar English word with a Latin root, so the knowledge of the Qabalah with the various attributions to each character in its alphabet will enable the student to understand and correlate ideas and concepts which otherwise would have"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"iv A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES INTRODUCTION v no apparent relation. A simple example is the concept of the Trinity in the Christian religion. The student is frequently amazed to . learn through a study of the Qabalah that Egyptian mythology followed a similar concept with its trinity of gods, Osiris the father, Isis the virgin-mother, and Horus the son. The Qabalah indicates similar correspondences in the pantheon of Roman and Greek deities, proving the father-mother (Holy Spirit) - son principles of deity are primordial archetypes of man's psyche, rather than being, as is frequently and erroneously supposed a development peculiar to the Christian era. At this juncture let me call attention to one set of attributions by Rittangelius usually found as an appendix attached to the Sepher Yetzirah, It lists a series of \"Intelligences\" for each one of the ten Sephiros and the twenty-two Paths of the Tree of Life. It seems to me, after prolonged meditation, that the common attributions of these Intelligences is altogether arbitrary and lacking in serious meaning. For example, Keser is called \"The Admirable or the Hidden Intelligence; it is the Primal Glory, for no created being can attain to its essence.\" This seems perfectly all right; the meaning at first sight seems to fit the significance of Keser as the first emanation from Ain Soph. But there are half a dozen other similar attributions that would have served equally well. For instance, it could have been called the \"Occult Intelligence\" usually attributed to the seventh Path or Sephirah, for surely Keser is secret in a way to be said of no other Sephirah. And what about the \"Absolute or Perfect Intelligence.\" That would have been even more explicit and appropriate, being applicable to Keser far more than to any other of the Paths. Similarly, there is one attributed to the 16th Path and called \"The Eternal or Triumphant Intelligence,\" so-called because it is the pleasure of the Glory, beyond which is no Glory like to it, and it is called also the Paradise prepared for the Righteous.\" Any of these several would have done equally well. Much is true of so many of the other attributions in this particular area-that is the so-called Intelligences of the Sepher Yetzirah. I do not think that their use or current arbitrary usage stands up to serious examination or criticism. A good many attributions in other symbolic areas, I feel are subject to the same criticism. The Egyptian Gods have been used with a good deal of carelessness, and without sufficient explanation of motives in assigning them as I did. In a recent edition of Crowley's masterpiece Liber 777 (which au fond is less a reflection of Crowley's mind as a recent critic claimed than a tabulation of some of the material given piecemeal in the Golden Dawn knowledge lectures), he gives for the first time brief explanations of the motives for his attributions. I too should have been far more explicit in the explanations I used in the case of some of the Gods whose names were used many times, most inadequately, where several paths were concerned. While it is true that the religious coloring of the Egyptian Gods differed from time to time during Egypt's turbulent history, nonetheless a word or two about just that one single point could have served a useful purpose. Some of the passages in the book force me today to emphasize that so far as the Qabalah is concerned, it could and should be employed without binding to it the partisan qualities of anyone particular religious faith. This goes as much for Judaism as it does for Christianity. Neither has much intrinsic usefulness where this scientific scheme is concerned. If some students feel hurt by this statement, that cannot be helped. The day of most contemporary faiths is over; they have been more of a curse than a boon to mankind. Nothing that I say here, however, should reflect on the peoples concerned, those who accept these religions. They are merely unfortunate. The religion itself is worn out and indeed is dying. The Qabalah has nothing to do with any of them. Attempts on the part of cultish-partisans to impart higher mystical meanings, through the Oabalah, etc., to their now sterile faiths is futile, and will be seen as such by the younger generation. They, the flower and love children, will have none of this nonsense."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"vi A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES I felt this a long time ago, as I still do, but even more so. The only way to explain the partisan Jewish attitude demonstrated in some small sections of the book can readily be explained. I had been reading some writings of Arthur Edward Waite, and some of his pomposity and turgidity stuck to my mantle. I disliked his patronising Christian attitude, and so swung all the way over to the other side of the pendulum. Actually, neither faith is particularly important in this day and age. I must be careful never to read Waite again before embarking upon literary work of my own. Much knowledge obtained by the ancients through the use of the Qabalah has been supported by discoveries of modern scie nt is ts-e an.thr opo logi sts, astronomers, psychiatrists, et al. Learned Qabalists for hundreds of years have been aware of what the psychiatrist has only discovered in the last few decades-sthat man's concept of himself, his deities and the Universe is a constantly evolving process, changing as man himself evolves on a higher spiral. But the roots of his concepts are buried in a race-consciousness that antedated Neanderthal man by uncounted aeons of time. What Jung calls archetypal images constantly rise to the surface of man's awareness from the vast unconscious that is the common heritage of all mankind. The tragedy of civilized man is that he is cut off from awareness of his own instincts. The Qabalah can help him achieve the necessary understanding to effect a reunion with them, so that rather than being driven by forces he does not understand, he can harness for his conscious use the same power that guides the homing pigeon, teaches the beaver to build a dam and keeps the planets revolving in their appointed orbits about the sun. I began the study of the Qabalah at an early age. Two books I read then have played unconsciously a prominent part in the writing of my own book. One of these was \"Q.B.L. or the Bride's Reception\" by Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones), which I must have first read around 1926. The other was \"An Introduction to the INTRODUCTION vii Tarot\" by Paul Foster Case, published in the early 1920's. It is now out of print, superseded by later versions of the same topic. But as I now glance through this slender book, I perceive how profoundly even the format of his book had influenced me, though in these two instances there was not a trace of plagiarism. It had not consciously occurred to me until recently that lowed so much to them. Since Paul Case passed away about a decade or so ago, this gives me the opportunity to thank him, overtly, wherever he may now be. By the middle of 1926 I had become aware of the work of Aleister Crowley, for whom I have a tremendous respect. I studied as many of his writings as I could gain access to, making copious notes, and later acted for several years as his secretary, having joined him. in Paris on October 12, 1928, a memorable day in my life. All sorts of books have been written on the Qabalah, some poor, some few others extremely good. But I came to feel the need for what might be called a sort of Berlitz handbook, a concise but comprehensive introduction, studded with diagrams and tables of easily understood definitions and correspondences to simplify the student's grasp of so complicated and abstruse a subject. During a short retirement in North Devon in 1931, I began to amalgamate my notes. It was out of these that A Gar den 0 f Pomesranates gradually emerged. I unashamedly admit that my book contains many direct plagiarisms from Crowley, Waite, Eliphas Levi, and D. H. Lawrence. I had incorporated numerous fragments from their works into my notebooks without citing individual references to the various sources from which I condensed my notes. Prior to the closing down of the Mandrake Press in London about 1930-31, I was employed as company secretary for a while. Along with several Crowley books, the Mandrake Press published a lovely little monogram by D. H. Lawrence entitled \"Apropos of Lady Chatterley's Lover.\" My own copy accompanied me on my travels for long years. Only recently did I discover that it had been lost. I hope that anyone of my former patients who had"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"viii A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES INTRODUCTION ix borrowed it will see fit to return it to me forthwith. The last chapter of A Garden deals with the Way of Return. It used almost entirely Crowley's concept of the Path as described in his superb essay \"One Star in Sight.\" In addition to this, I borrowed extensively from Lawrence's Apropos. Somehow, they all fitted together very nicely. In time, all these variegated notes were incorporated into the text without acknowledgment, an oversight which I now feel sure would be forgiven, since I was only twenty-four at the time. Some modern Nature-worshippers and members of the newly-washed and redeemed witch-cult have complimented me on this closing chapter which I entitled ''The Ladder.\" I am pleased about this. For a very long time I was not at all familiar with the topic of witchcraft. I had avoided it entirely, not being attracted to its literature in any way. In fact, I only became slightly conversant with its theme and literature just a few years ago, after reading \"The Anatomy of Eve\" written by Dr. Leopold Stein, a Jungian analyst. In the middle of his study of four cases, he included a most informative chapter on the subject. This served to stimulate me to wider reading in that area. In 1932, at the suggestion of Thomas Burke, the novelist, I submitted my manuscript to one of his publishers, Messrs. Constable in London. They were unable to use it, but made some encouraging comments and advised me to submit it to Riders. To my delight and surprise, Riders published it, and throughout the years the reaction it has had indicated other students found it also fulfilled their need for a condensed and simplified survey of such a vast subject as the Qabalah. The importance of the book to me was and is five-fold. 1) It provided a yardstick by which to measure my personal progress in the understanding of the Qabalah. 2) Therefore it can have an equivalent value to the modern student. 3) It serves as a theoretical introduction to the Qabalistic foundation of the magical work of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. 4) It throws considerable light on the occasionally obscure writings of Aleister Crowley. 5) It is dedicated to Crowley, who was the Ankh-af-na-Khonsu mentioned in The Book of the Law-a dedication which served both as a token of personal loyalty and devotion to. Crowley, but was also a gesture of my spiritual independence from him. In his profound investigation into the origins and basic nature of man, Robert Ardrey in African Genesis recently made a shocking statement. Although man has begun the conquest of outer space, the ignorance of his own nature, says Ardrey, \"has become institutionalized, universalized and sanctified.\" He further states that were a brotherhood of man to be formed today, \"its only possible common bond would be ignorance of what man is.\" Such a condition is both deplorable and appalling when the means are readily available for man to acquire a thorough understanding of himself-and in so doing, an understanding of his neighbor and the world in which he lives as well as the greater Universe of which each is a part. May everyone who reads this new edition of A Garden of Pomegranates be encouraged and inspired to light his own candle of inner vision and begin his journey into the boundless space that lies within himself. Then, through realization of his true identity, each student can become a lamp unto his own path. And more. Awareness of the Truth of his being will rip asunder the veil of unknowing that has heretofore enshrouded the star he already is, permitting the brilliance of his light to illumine the darkness of that part of the Universe in which he abides."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PREFACE B ASE D on the versi.cle in the Song of Songs, \"Thy plants are an orchard of Pomegranates\", a book entitled Pardis Rimonim came to be written by Rabbi Moses Cordovero in the sixteenth century. By some authorities this philosopher is considered as the greatest lamp in post-Zoharic days of that spiritual Menorah, the Qabalah, which, with so rare a grace and so profuse an irradiation of the Supernal Light, illuminated the literature and religious philosophy of the Jewish people as well as their immediate and subsequent neighbours in the Dias- pora, The English equivalent of Pardis Rimonim-A Garden of Pomegranates-I have adopted as the title of my own modest work, although I am forced to confess that this latter has but little connection either in actual fact or in historicity with that of Cordovero. In the golden harvest of purely spiritual intimations which the Holy Qabalah brings, I truly feel that a veritable garden of the soul may be builded; a garden of immense magnitude and lofty significance, wherein may be discovered by each one of us all manner and kind of exotic fruit and gracious flower of exquisite colour. The pomegranate, may I add, has always been for mystics everywhere a favourable object for recon- dite symbolism. The garden or orchard has likewise pro- duced in that book named The Book of Splendour an almost inexhaustible treasury of spiritual imagery of superb and magnificent taste. This book goes forth then in the hope that, as a modern writer has put it : .. There are not many, those who have no secret garden of the. mind.

They encompass almost always truth and beauty, and are radiant with the light that never was on sea or land.\" {CLARE CAMERON, Green Fields of England.} Should there be those who are so unfortunate as to possess no such sacred sanctuary of their own, one builded with their own hands, I humbly offer this well-tended garden of Pomegranates which has been bequeathed to me. I hope that therein may be gathered a few little shoots, a rare flower or two, or some ripe fruit which may serve as the nucleus or the wherewithal for the planting of such a secret garden of the mind, without which there is no peace, nor joy, nor happiness. It is fitting that a note of appreciation to my predecessors in Qabalistic research should accompany this work, in which I have endeavoured to present an exposition of the basic principles underlying the Qabalah, to serve as a text- book for its study. I have scrupulously avoided contention and unnecessary controversy. I am greatly indebted to Madame H. P. Blavatsky's writings, and I believe I shall not be too egotistical in claiming that a proper understanding of the principles outlined herein will reveal many points of subtlety and philosophic interest in her Secret Doctrine, and aid in the comprehension of this monumental work of hers. The same is also true of S. L. McGregor Mathers' translation of portions of the Zohar, \" The Kaballah Unveiled\", and of Arthur E. Waite's excellent compendium of the Zohar, \" The Secret Doctrine in Israel\", both of which are closed books, in the main, to most students of mystical lore and philosophy who do not have the specialized comparative knowledge which I have endeavoured to incorporate in this little book. I should here call attention to a tract, the author of which is unknown, entitled The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom, of which splendid translations have been made by W. Wynn Westcott, Arthur E. Waite, and Knut Stenring. In the course of time this appears to have become incorporated into, and affiliated with, the text of the Sepher Yetsirah, although several critics place it at a later date than the genuine Mishnahs of the Sepher Yetsirah. However, in giving the titles of the Paths from this tract, I have named throughout the source as the Sepher Yetsirah to avoid unnecessary confusion. It is to be hoped that no adverse criticism will arise on this point. Since the question of Magick has been slightly dealt with in the last chapter of this book, it is perhaps advisable here to state that the interpretations given to certain doctrines and to some of the Hebrew letters border very closely on magical formulre. I have purposely refrained, however, from entering into a deeper consideration of the Practical Qabalah, although several hints of value may be discovered in the explanation of the Tetragrammaton, for example, which may prove of no inconsiderable service. As I have previously remarked, this book is primarily intended as an elementary textbook of the Qabalah, interpreted as a new system for philosophical classification. This must consti- tute my sale excuse for what may appear to be a refusal to deal more adequately with methods of Attainment.

The word \" Qabalah \" is derived from a Hebrew root ~:1i' (QBL) meaning \"to receive\". The legend is that this philosophy is a knowledge of things first taught by the Demiurgos to a select company of spiritual intelligences of a lofty rank who, after the Fall, communicated its divine injunctions to Mankind-who, in reality, were themselves in incarnation. It is also denominated the Chokmah Nistorah, \"The Secret Wisdotn\", so-called because it has been orally transmitted from Adept to Pupil in the Secret Sanctuaries of Initiation. Tradition has it that no one part of this doctrine was accepted as authori- tative until it had been subjected to severe and minute criticism and investigation by methods of practical research to be described later. To come down to more historic ground, the Qabalah is the Jewish mystical teaching concerning the initiated inter- pretation of the Hebrew scriptures. It is a system of spiritual philosophy or theosophy, using this word in its original implications of 6eoS' '2.orpta, which has not only exercised for centuries an influence on the intellectual development of so shrewd and clear-thinking a people as the Jews, but has attracted the attention of many renowned 17"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"18 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES HISTORICAL SURVEY 19 theological and philosophical thinkers, particularly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Among those devoted to the study of its theorems were Raymond Lully, the scholastic metaphysician and alchemist; John Reuchlin, who revived Oriental Philosophy in Europe ; John Baptist von Helmont, the physician and chemist who discovered hydrogen; Baruch Spinoza, the excommunicated \"God- intoxicated\" Jewish philosopher; and Dr. Henry More, the famous Cambridge Platonist. These men, to name but a few among many who have been attracted to the Qabalistic ideology, after restlessly searching for a world- view which should disclose to them the true explanations of life, and show the real inner bond uniting all things, found the cravings of their minds at least partially satisfied by its psychological and philosophical system. It is often assumed to-day that Judaism and Mysticism stand at opposite poles of thought, and that therefore Jewish Mysticism is a glaring contradiction in terms. The erroneous assumption here arises from the antithesis of law and faith as set up by St. Paul's proselytising men- tality (and in a lesser degree by the rationalist efforts of Maimonides to square everything with formal Aristotelean principles), falsely stamping Judaism as a religion of un- relieved legalism. Mysticism is the irreconcilable enemy of purely religious legalism. The confusion is also due to the efforts of those theo- logians in medireval times who, being desirous of saving their benighted Hebrew brethren from the pangs of eternal torture and damnation in the nether regions, muddled and tampered not only with the original texts but with extreme sectarian interpretations in order to show that the authors of the Qabalistic books were desirous that their Jewish posterity should become apostates to Christianity. The Qabalah taken in its traditional and literal form -as contained in the Sepher Yetsirah, Bes Elohim, Pardis Rimonim, and Sepher haZohar-is either mostly unintelligible or, at first sight, apparent nonsense to the ordinary \"logical\" person. But it contains as its ground plan that most precious jewel of human thought, that geometrical arrangement of Names, Numbers, Sym- bols, and Ideas called \"The Tree of Life\". It is called DIAGRAM No.1 The h-ee of Life"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"20 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES HISTORICAL SURVEY 21 most precious, because it has been found to be the most convenient system yet discovered of classifying the phe- nomena of the Universe and recording their relations, whereof the proof is the limitless possibilities for analytic and synthetic thought which follow the adoption of this schema. The history of the Qabalah, so far as the publication of early exoteric texts is concerned, is indeterminate and vague. Literary criticism traces the Sepher Yetsirah (sup- posedly by Rabbi Akiba) and the Sepher haZohar (by Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai), its main texts, to about the eighth century in the first case and the third or fourth century A.D. in the latter. Some historians claim that the Qabalah is a derivative from Pythagorean, Gnostic, and Neoplatonic sources, this latter view being, in particular, the opinion of Mr. Christian D. Ginsburg. The great Jewish historian, Graetz, too, holds the unhistoric view that Jewish mysticism is a morbid and late growth, foreign to the religious genius of Israel, and that it has its origin in the speculations of one Isaac the Blind in Spain somewhere between the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Graetz regards the Qabalah, the Zohar in particular, as a\" false doctrine which, although new, styled itself a genuine teaching of Israel\" (History of the Jews, Vol. III, p. 565). This statement is altogether without foundation in fact, for a careful perusal of the books of the Old Testament, the Talmud, and other well-known Rabbinical records which have come down to us, indicate that there the early monumental bases of the Qabalah may be found. The Qabalistic doctrine admittedly is not explicit there, but analysis reveals it to be tacitly assumed, and the many cryptic remarks of several of the more important Rabbis can have no particle of meaning without the implication of a mystical philosophy cherished and venerated in their hearts, and affecting the whole of their teaching. In his brilliant essay, \"The Origin of Letters and Numerals according to the Sepher Yetsirah \", Mr. Phineas Mordell argues that the Pythagorean Number Philosophy (the greatest enigma of all philosophical systems of anti- quity) is identical with that of the Sepher Yetsirah, and that its philosophy apparently emanated from one of the Hebrew prophetic schools. Mordell finally hazards the opinion that the Sepher Yetsirah represents the genuine fragments of Philolaus, who was the first to publish the Pythagorean philosophy, and that Philolaus seems to correspond in very curious ways to Joseph ben Uziel who wrote down the Sepher Yetsirah. If the latter theory can be maintained, then we may claim for the Sepher Yetsirah a pre-Talmudic origin-probably the second century prior to the Christian era. The Zohar, if actually the work of Simeon ben Y ochai, was never consigned to writing at the time but had been orally handed down by the companions of the Holy Assemblies, being finally written up by Rabbi Moses ben Leon in the thirteenth century. Madame Blavatsky ven- tures the hypothesis that the Zohar, as now possessed by us, was arranged and re-edited by Moses de Leon after having been tampered with to a considerable extent by Jewish Rabbis and Christian ecclesiastics prior to the thirteenth century. Ginsburg in his Kabbalah gives several reasons why the Zohar must have been written in the thirteenth century. His arguments, though interesting in numerous ways, do not take into consideration the fact that there has always been an oral tradition. Isaac Myel', in his large and in a number of ways authoritative tome entitled The Qabalah, analyses very carefully these objections advanced by Ginsburg and others, and I am bound to confess that his answers, ad seriatim, confute this theory of the thir- teenth-century origin of the Zohar. Dr. S. M. Schiller- Szinessy, one-time Reader in Rabbinic and Talmudic literature at Cambridge, says: \"The nucleus of the book is of Mishnic times. Rabbi Shimeon ben Yochai was the author of the Zohar in the same sense that Rabbi Yohanan was the author of the Palestinian Talmud; i.e., he gave the first impulse to the composition of the book.\" And I find that Mr. Arthur Edward Waite in his scholarly and classic work The Holy Kaballah, wherein he examines most of the arguments concerning the origin and history of this Book of Splendour, inclines to the view hereinbefore set forth, steering a middle course, believing that while much of it does pertain to the era of ben Leon, nevertheless a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"22 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES HISTORICAL SURVEY 28 great deal more bears indelibly the stamp of antiquity. It most certainly is not altogether improbable that the Zohar-with its mystical doctrines comparable, nay, identi- cal in almost each of its details with those of other races in other climes-should have been composed originally by Simeon ben Yochai or another of his close associates or students in the second century but not committed to writing by Moses de Leon until the thirteenth century. A very similar presentation of the above hypothesis is found in Prof. Abelson's excellent work entitled Jewish Mysticism,wherein we read that: \" We must be on our guard against following the mis- taken opinion of a certain set of Jewish theologians who would have us regard the whole of the medieeval Kabbalah (of which the Zohar is a conspicuous and representative part) as a sudden and strange importation from without. It is really a continuation of the old stream of Talmudic and Midrashic thought with the admixture of extraneous ele- ments picked up, as was inevitable, by the stream's course through many lands-elements the commingling of which must have, in many ways, transformed the original colour and nature of the stream.\" Be that as it may, and ignoring the sterile aspects of con- troversy, the public appearance of the Zohar was the great landmark in the development of the Qabalah, and we to-day are able to divide its history into two main periods, pre- and post-Zoharic. While it is undeniable that there were Jewish prophetic and mystical Schools of great proficiency and possessing much recondite knowledge in Biblical times, such as that of Samuel, the Essenes, and Philo, yet the first Qabalistic school of which we have any accurate public record was known as the School of Gerona in Spain (the twelfth century A.D.), so-called because its founder Isaac the Blind and many of his disciples were born there. Of the founder of the School practically nothing is known. Two of his students were Rabbi Azariel and Rabbi Ezra. The former was the author of a classic philosophical work entitled The Commentary on the Ten Sephiros, an excellent and most lucid exposition of Qabalistic philosophy and considered an authoritative work by those who know it. These were succeeded by Nachmanides, born in 1195 A.D., who was the real cause of the attention devoted to this esoteric system in those days in Spain and Europe generally. His works deal mainly with the three methods of per- mutation of numbers, letters, and words to be described in Chapter VI. The philosophy underwent a further elaboration and exposition in the hands of R. Isaac Nasir and Jacob ben Sheshet in the twelfth century, the latter composing a tr~atise in rhymed prose and a series of eight essays dealing WIth the doctrines of the Infinite (En Soph),Reincarnation (Gilgolim), the doctrine of Divine Retribution (Sod ha Gimol), or, to use a more preferable Oriental term, Karma, and a peculiar type of Christology. Next in succession was the School of Segovia and its d.isciples, among whom was one Todras Abulafia, a physi- cian and financier occupying an important and most dis- tinguished position in the Court of Sancho IV, King of Castile. The characteristic predisposition of this School was its devotion to exegetical methods; its disciples endeavour- ing to interpret the Bible and the Hagadah in accordance with the doctrinal Qabalah. A contemporary School believed that Judaism of that day, taken from an exclusively philosophical standpoint, did not show the \"right way to the Sanctuary\", and endeavoured to combine philosophy and Qabalah, illustrating their various theorems by mathematical forms. About 1240 A.D. was born Abraham Abulafia, who became a celebrated figure-bringing, however, a great deal of dis- repute to the name of this theosophy. He studied philo- logy, medicine,and philosophy, as well as those few books on the Qabalah which were available at the time. He soon perceived that the Pythagorean Number Philosophy was identical with that expounded in the Sepher Yetsirah, and later, becoming dissatisfied with academic research, he turned towards that aspect of Qabalah termed n'?:li' i1'W~t:l . or the Practical Qabalah, which, to-day, we term Magick. Unfortunately, the Qabalists in the public eye at that time were not acquainted with the developed specialized technique that is now available, derived as it is from the Collegiiad Spiritum Sanctum. The result was that"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"24 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES HISTORICAL SURVEY 25 Abulafia became quite deluded in his subsequent experi- mentations, and journeyed to Rome to endeavour to con- vert the Pope (of all people 1) to Judaism. How successful were his efforts can be left to the reader to judge. Later, he hailed himself in a most enthusiastic way as the long-expected Messiah and prophesied the millenium- which failed to occur. His influence, on the whole, has been a deleterious one. A disciple of his, Joseph Gikatilla, wrote in the interests and defence of his teacher a. number of treatises dealing with the several aspects of exegesis established by him. The Zohar is the next major development. This book combining, absorbing, and synthesizing the different features and doctrines of the previous schools, made its debut, creating a profound sensation in theological and philosophical circles by reason of its speculations concerning God, the doctrine of Emanations, the evolution of the Universe, the Soul and its transmigrations, and its final return to the Source of All. The new era in the history of the Qabalah created by the appearance of this storehouse of legend, philosophy, and anecdote, has continued right down to the present day. Yet nearly every writer who has since espoused the doctrines of the Qabalah has made the Zohar his principal textbook, and its exponents have applied themselves assiduously to commentaries, epitomes, and translations-missing, however, with only a few exceptions, the real underlying possibilities of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The Zohar so impressed the celebrated scholastic meta- physician and experimental chemist, Raymond Lully, that it suggested to him the development of the Ars Magna (The Great Work), an idea in the exposition of which he exhibits the loftiest conceptions of the Qabalah, regarding it as a divine science and a genuine revelation of Light to the human soul. He was one of those few isolated figures attracted to its study, who saw through its use of a peculiar type of symbol, and endeavoured to construct a workable magical or philosophical alphabet, an explanation of which will be attempted in the remaining chapters of this work. Abraham Ibn Wakar, Pico di Mirandola, Reuchlin, Moses Cordovero, and Isaac Luria, are a few of the more importantthinkers before the seventeenth century, whose speculations have affected in various ways the progress of Qabalistic research. The first-named (an Aristotelean) made a really noble attempt to reconcile Qabalah with the academic philosophy of his day, and wrote a treatise which is an excellent compendium of the Qabalah. Mirandola and Reuchlin were Christians who took up a study of the Qabalah with the ulterior motive of obtaining a suitable weapon wherewith to convert Jews to Chris- tianity. Some Jews were so misguided and sadly bewildered by the mangling of texts and distorted inter- pretations which ensued that they actually forsook Judaism. Paul Ricci, physician to the Emperor Maxi- milian I; John Stephen Rittengal, a translator of the Sepher Yetsirah into Latin; and in more recent times Jacob Franck and his community were won over to Chris- tianity by the controversial claim that the Zohar both concealed and revealed the doctrines of the Nazarene. Such proofs, naturally, brought only contempt to their authors, and to-day argue badly against both the adducers and the accepters of them. Cordovero became a Master of the Qabalah at an early age, and his principal works are philosophical, having little to do with the magical or practical side. Luria founded a School the precise opposite to that of Cordovero. He himself was a zealous and brilliant student both of the Talmud and Rabbinic lore, but found that the simple retirement of a life of study did not satisfy him. He thereupon retired to the banks of the Nile, where he gave himself over exclusively to meditation and ascetic practices, receiving visions of an amazing character. He wrote a book outlining his conceptions of the theory of Reincar- nation (haGilgolim). A pupil of his, Rabbi Chayim Vital, produced a large work, The Tree of Life, based on the oral teachings of the Master, thereby giving a tremendous impetus to Qabalistic study and practice. There are several Qabalists of varying degrees of impor- tance in the intervening period of post-Zoharic history. Russia, Poland, and Lithuania gave refuge to numbers of t~em. N on~ of these have expounded publicly that par- ticular portion of the philosophy to which this present"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"26 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES HISTORICAL SURVEY 27 treatise is devoted. The spiritual revivalist movement inaugurated among the Jews of Poland by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov in the first half of the eighteenth century is sufficiently important to warrant some mention here. For although Chassidism, as that movement was called, derives its enthusiasm from contact with nature and the great out-doors of the Carpathians, it has its primary literary origin and significant inspiration in the books which consti- tute the Qabalah. Chassidism gave the doctrines of the Zohar to the\" Am ha-aretz \" in a way in which no previous set of Rabbis had succeeded in doing, and it would, more- over, appear that the Practical Qabalah received a con- siderable impetus at the same time. For we find that Poland, Galicia, and certain portions of Russia have been the scene of the activities of wandering Rabbis and Tal- mudic scholars who were styled\" Tsadikim \" or magicians, men who assiduously devoted their lives and their powers to the Practical Qabalah. But it was not until the last century, with its impetus to all kinds of studies in com- parative mythology and religious controversy that we dis- cover an attempt to weld all philosophies, religions. scientific ideas and symbols into a coherent Whole. Eliphaz Levi Zahed, a Roman Catholic deacon of remark- able perspicuity, in 1852 published a brilliant volume, Doctrine et Rituel de la Haute Magie, in which we find clear and unmistakable symptoms of an understanding of the underlying basis of the Qabalah-its ten Sephiros and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet as a suitable framework for the construction of a workable system for philosophical comparison and synthesis. It is said that he published this work at a time when information on all occult matters was strictly prohibited, for various reasons of its own, by the Esoteric School to which he belonged. We find, then, a companion volume issued but a short while after, La Histoire de la Magie, wherein-undoubtedly to protect himself from the censure levelled at him, and throw unsuspecting enquirers off the track-he contradicts his former conclusions and theorizations. Several devoted expositors of impeccable scholarship in the last half of the nineteenth century were responsible for the modern regeneration of the fundamental and saner principles of the Qabalah, devoid of the theological accre- tions and hysterical superstitions which were deposited on this venerable arcane philosophy during the Middle Ages. W. Wynn Westcott, who translated the Sepher Yetsirah into English and wrote An Introduction to the Study of the Kaballah; S. L. McGregor Mathers, the translator of por- tions of the Zohar and The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage; Madame Blavatsky, that lion-hearted woman who brought Eastern esoteric philosophy to the attention of western students; Arthur Edward Waite, who made available expository summaries of various of the Qabalistic works· and the poet Aleister Crowley to whose Liber 777 and S;pher Sephiroth, among many other fine philosophic writings, I am in no little degree indebted-all these have provided a wealth of vital information which could be utilized for the construction of a philosophical alphabet."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE PIT 29 CHAPTER TWO THE PIT T HE philosophy of the Qabalah is essentially esoteric. Yet the practical methods of esoteric and secular investigations are essentially identical -continual and persistent experimentation, the endeavour to eliminate chance and error, and the effort to ascertain the constants and variables of the equations investigated. The one main difference is that they occupy themselves exclusively with different realms of research. Formal academic philosophy glorifies the intellect and thus makes research into what are, after all, incidentals- if we consider philosophy as the supreme means of investi- gating the problems of life and the universe. The Qabalah makes the primary claim that the intellect contains within itself a principle of self-contradiction, and that, therefore, it is an unreliable instrument to use in the great Quest for Truth. Numerous academic philosophers have likewise arrived at a similar conclusion. Some of the greater of these have despaired of ever devising a suitable method of transcending this limitation, and became sceptics. Others, seeing simply the solution, have seized upon intuition, or to be more accurate, the intellectual concept of intuition, leaving us, however, with no methods of checking and verifying that intuition, which in consequence is so liable to degenerate into mere guesswork, coloured by personal inclination and abetted by gross wish-phantasm. The two main methods of the traditional and esoteric Qabalah are Meditation (Yoga) and Practical Qabalah (Magick). By Yoga is meant that rigorous system of mental and self discipline which has as its primary aim the absolute and complete control of the thinking principle, the Ruach; the ultimate object being to obtain the faculty with which to still the stream of thought at will, so that 28 that which is behind (as it were), or above, or beyond the mind can manifest on to the stillness thus produced. The quiescence of the mental turbulence is the primary essential. With this faculty at command, the student is taught to exalt the mind by the various technical methods of Magick until it overrides the normal limitations and barriers of its nature, ascending in a tremendous unquench- able column of fire-like ecstasy to the Universal Conscious- ness, with which it becomes united. Once having become at one with transcendental Existence, it intuitively par- takes of universal knowledge, which is considered to be a more reliable source of information than the rational introspection of the intellect or the experimental scientific investigation of matter can give. It is the tapping of the source of Life itself, the fons et origo of existence, rather than a blind groping in the dark after confused symbols which alone appear on the so-called practical or rational plane of thought. Secular science or Positivism has busied itself with the investigation of matter and the visible universe as per- ceived through the five senses. It affirms that by a study of phenomena we are able to approach to the world as it really is, to the things-in-themselves. It is that system which affirms that apprehension is only a name for a cer- tain series of biological and chemical changes occurring in certain of the contents of our material skulls, and that by an investigation of things as they appear to be we can come to an understanding of their causes, what they really are. The contrary philosophical argument of the idealistic schools is that in studying the laws of Nature, we only study the laws of our own minds; that it would be quite simple to demonstrate that, after all, we really attach very little meaning to such ideas as matter, motion, and weight, etc., other than a purely idealistic one; that they are mere phases of our thought. Qabalists and all the various schools of Mystics generally begin from a still more absolute point of view, arguing that the whole controversy is a purely verbal one; for all such ontological propositions can, with a little ingenuity, be reduced to one form or another. There is in consequence of this observation in the realm of modern Philosophy what is"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"80 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE PIT 81 frankly considered to be an uncompromising deadlock. Qabalists assert that Reason is a weapon inadequate to the Search for Reality since its nature is essentially self-contra- dictory. Hume and Kant both saw this; but the one became a sceptic in the widest sense of the term, and with the other, the conclusion hid itself behind a verbose transcendentalism. Spencer, too, saw it, but tried to gloss it over and to bury it beneath the ponderousness of his erudition. The Qabalah, in the words of one of its most zealous advocates, settles the dispute by laying a finger on the weak point; \" Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite and unknown; and all their words are skew-wise.\" The Universe cannot be explained by reason; its nature is obviously irrational. As remarked by Prof. Henri Bergson: \"Our thought in its purely logical form is incapable of presenting the true nature of life\" and the intellectual faculty is characterized by a\" natural inability to comprehend life.\" Prof. Arthur S. Eddington has also observed that \"the ultimate elements ill a theory of the world must be of a nature impossible to define in terms recognizable to the mind.\" A more recent statement by one who is considered an excellent exponent of modern scientific opinion is found in What Dare 1 Think, by Julian Huxley: \" There is no reason why the universe is perfect; there is, indeed, no reason why it should berational.\" One of the paradoxes of the intellect is that despite the fact that our knowledge is purely phenomenal, neverthe- less even that knowledge is of no real depth. For instance, the judgment a is a is a meaningless tautology. In order to be significant our thought must pass beyond the bare identity of an object with itself, but it must not pass to something which has naught in common with the object. Thus, if we assert a equals h, the judgment is false, since we pass from a to b, the latter having nothing in common with a. It is obvious, however, that a definition of this unknown a can only be achieved by saying either a equals b or a equals cd. In the first case the idea of b is really implicit in a; thus we have learned nothing, and if not so, the state- ment is false. One simply defines one unknown in terms of another-and nothing is gained. In the second case, c and d themselves require definition as e1 and gh respectively. The process becomes extended; but it is bound to end by the eventual exhaustion of the alphabet, y equals za. In short, one gets no further than a equals a. The relation of the whole series of equations then becomes apparent, and the conclusion to which one is forced is that each and every term is a thing-in-itself, unknown, though to some extent apprehensible by Intuition. There are several proofs of this, the simplest of which is perhaps as follows, showing that the most obvious state- ment cannot bear analysis. .. A simple question is : .\" .What is vermilion ?\" That\" vermilion is red \" is undeniable, no doubt, but quite meaningless nevertheless; for each of the two terms must be defined by means of at least two others of which the same is true. So simple an enquiry, too, as \"Why is sugar sweet? \" involves a vast multitude of very highly complicated chemical researches, each one of which eventually leads to that blindest of all blank walls-what is matter ?-what the perceiving mind ? We may continue further, if we wish, and ask: \"What is the Moon?\" Science (let us facetiously suppose) replies \"Green cheese I\" For our one moon we have now two distinct ideas and all simplicity vanishes and recedes in the darkness. Greenness and Cheese I The one depends on the light of the sun, the sense apparatus of the optic nerves and organs, and a thousand of other things; the latter on bacteria, fermentation, and the nature of the cow. Then we continue to split hairs and juggle words-naught but hairs and words,and juggling and splitting-and we have got no single question answered in any ultimate sense at all. There is, therefore, no possible escape from this bottom- less pit of confusion save by the development of a faculty of mind which shall not be manifestly inadequate in any of these ways. 'We must employ means other than, and superior to, ratiocination. We thus approach the problem of the development of the Neschamali (Intuition), and it is here that the Qabalah differs in method and content from Secular Science and Academic Philosophy. Yet the progress of secular science in the last thirty years"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"32 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE PIT 83 certainly brings it nearer to the Qabalistic conception of things; the old sanctions of a scientific mechanism have nearly all disappeared, and the terms which appeared to the Victorians so simple, objective, and intelligible-such as matter, energy, space, etc.-have completely failed to resist analysis. A few modern thinkers, seeing clearly the abso- lute debacle in which the old positivist science was bound to lead them, the breaking up of this icy expanse of frozen thought, determined at all costs to find a modus vivendi for Athena. This necessity was emphasized in the most sur- prising way by the result of the Michelson-Morley experi- ments, when Physics itself calmly and frankly offered a contradiction in terms. It was not the metaphysicians this time who were picking holes in a vacuum. It was the mathematicians and the physicists who found the ground completely cut away from under their feet. It was not enough to replace the geometry of Euclid by those of Rie- mann and Lobatchevsky and the mechanics of Newton by those of Einstein, so long as any of the axioms of the old thought and the definitions of its terms survived. They deliberately abandoned positivism and materialism for an indeterminate mysticism, creating a new mathematical philosophy and a new logic, wherein infinite-or rather transfinite-ideas might be made commensurable with those of ordinary thought in the forlorn hope that all might live happily ever after. In short, to use a Qabalistic nomenclature, they found it incumbent upon themselves to adopt for inclusion of terms of Ruach (intellect) concepts which are proper only to Neschamah (the organ and faculty of direct spiritual apperception and intuition). This same process took place in Philosophy years earlier. Had the dialectic of Hegel been only. half understood, the major portion of philosophical speculation from the Schoolmen to Kant's perception of the Antinomies of Reason would have been thrown overboard. C. G. Jung, the eminent European psycho-analyst, writes in Wilhelm's Secret of the Golden Flower: \"Therefore, I can only take the reaction which begins in the West against the intellect ••• in favour of intuition, as a mark of cultural advance, a widening of consciousness beyond the too narrow limits set by a tyrannical intellect\" (p. 82). Incidentally, one of the greatest difficulties experienced by the philosopher-s-a difficulty almost insurmountable by the student; one which continually tends to increase rather than diminish with the advance in knowledge-is this: it is practically impossible to gain any clear intel- lectual comprehension of the meaning of philosophical terms employed. Every thinker has his own private con- ception of, and meaning for, even such common and uni- versally used terms as \" soul\" and \" mind\"; and in the vast majority of cases he does not so much as suspect that other writers may employ the same term under a different connotation. Even technical writers, those who sometimes take the trouble of defining their terms before using them, are too often at variance with each other. The diversity is very great, as stated above, in the case of the word \" soul\". We find one writer predicating of the soul that it is a, b, and c, while his fellow-students protest vehemently that it is nothing of the sort, but d, e, andf. However, let us suppose for a moment that by some miracle we obtain a clear idea of the meaning of the word. The trouble has merely begun. For there immediately arises the question of the relation of one term to the others. In view of this continual source of misunderstanding, it is clearly necessary to establish a fundamental and universal language for the communication ofideas, One understands with bitter approval the sad outburst of the aged Fichte : \" If I had my life to live over again, the first thing I would do would be to invent an entirely new system of symbols whereby to convey my ideas.\" As a matter of fact, had he but known this, certain people-principally some of the early Qabalists, among whom we may include Raymond Lully, William Postel, etc.-had actually attempted this Great Work of con- structing a coherent system. Those which were coherent were, sad to say, hardly comprehended or subscribed to. It is sometimes claimed that the Buddhist terminology, as contained in the Abidhamma, provides a sufficiently complete philosophical alphabet. While there is much to be said in favour of the Buddhist system, we cannot wholly concur with this opinion for the following reasons: Firstly, the actual words are barbarously long, impossibly so for the average European."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"84 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE PIT 85 Secondly, an understanding of that system demands complete acquiescence in the Buddhist doctrinalia, which we are not prepared to give. Thirdly, the meaning of the terms is not as clear, precise, and comprehensive as could be wished. There is most certainly a great deal of pedantry, disputed matter, and confusion. Only recently, I learn that Mrs. Rhys Davids hes issued a book on Buddhist Origins, in which the ques- tion among others is raised by her as to the correct transla- tion or meaning of the Pali word\" Dhamma\"; whether it implies \"law\", \"conscience\", \"life\", or simply the Buddhist doctrine. Fourthly, the terminology is exclusively psychological and takes no account of extra-Buddhistic ideas, and it bears but little relation to the general order of the universe. It might, of course, be supplemented by Hindu or other terminology, but to do so would immediately introduce more numerous elements of controversy. 'We should at once be lost in endless discussion as to whether Nibbana was Nirvana, and as to whether extinction or something else was implied; and so on for ever. The system of the Qabalah, whose terms as we shall see are largely symbolic, is of course superficially open to this last objection. But because it is very largely symbolic, it has the best sanction of those who are considered eminent authorities in the sciences, for the whole of modern science occupies itself with various symbols by which it endeavours to comprehend the physical world-symbols beyond which, however, it frankly confesses itself unable to pass. An illuminating remark occurs in Prof. Eddington's 1928 Swarthmore Lecture, Science and the Unseen World.! \" I can only say that physical science has turned its back on all such models, regarding them now rather as a hindrance to the apprehension of the truth behind pheno- mena. . . . And if to-day you ask a physicist what he has finally made out the rether or the electron to be, the answer will not be a description in terms of billiard balls or fly- wheels or anything concrete; he will point instead to a number of symbols and a set of mathematical equations which they satisfy. What do the symbols stand for? The mysterious reply is given that physics is indifferent to that; it has no means of probing beneath the symbolism. To understand the phenomena of the physical world it is necessary to know the equations which the symbols obey but not the nature of that which is being symbolized.\" Sir James Jeans confirms this view of the use of symbols, for on page 141 of his The Mysterious Universe, he writes: \" The making of models or pictures to explain mathe- matical formulre and the phenomena they describe, is not a step towards, but a step away from, reality. . • . In brief, a mathematical formula can never tell us what a thing is, but only how it behaves; it can only specify an object through its properties.\" The Qabalist, therefore, is in no fear of attack from hostile sources because of his use of symbols, for the real basis of the Holy Qabalah, the tcn Sephiros and the twenty- two Paths, is mathematically sound and definite. We can easily discard the theological and dogmatic interpretations of the ancient Rabbanim as useless, and not affecting this real basis itself, and refcr everything in the universe to the fundamental system of pure Number. Its symbols will be intelligible to all rational minds in an identical sense, since the relations obtaining between these symbols are fixed by nature. It is this consideration which has led to the adoption of the Qabalistic \" Tree of Life\" as the basis of the universal philosophical alphabet. The apologia for this system (if such be needed) is, as has already been stated, that our purest conceptions are sym- bolized in mathematics. Bertrand Russell, Cantor, Poin- care, Einstein, and others have been hard at work to replace the Victorian empiricism by an intelligible coherent inter- pretation of the universe by means of mathematical ideas and symbols. Modern conceptions of mathematics, chemistry, and physics are sheer paradox to the\" plain man\" who thinks of matter, for example, as something that he can knock up against. There appears to be no doubt nowadays that the ultimate nature of Science in any of its branches will be purely abstract, almost of a Qabalistic character one might say, even though it may never be officially denominated the Qabalah. It is natural and proper to represent the Cosmos or any part of it, or its"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"86 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES operations in any of its aspects, by the symbols of pure Number. The ten numbers and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet with their traditional and rational correspondences-also taking into consideration their numerical and geometrical relations-afford us a coherent systematic groundwork for our alphabet; a basis suffi- ciently rigid for our foundation, yet sufficiently elastic for our superstructure. CHAPTER THREE THE SEPHIROS I N the previous chapter it was suggested that the Qabalah is the most suitable system for the basis of our magical alphabet, to which we shall be able to refer the sum total of all our knowledge and experience-e-reli- gious, philosophical, and scientific. The Qabalistic Alpha- bet is, as we shall proceed to explain, an elaborate system of attributions and correspondences; a convenient method of classification enabling the philosopher to docket his experiences and ideas as he obtains them. It is comparable to a filing cabinet of thirty-two jackets in which an exten- sive system of information is filed. It would be fallacious for the student to expect a concrete definition of everything which the cabinet contains. That is a sheer impossibility for quite obvious reasons. Each student must work for himself, once given the method of putting the whole of his mental and moral constitution into these thirty-two filing jackets. The necessity for personal work becomes apparent when one realizes that in normal business procedure, for instance, one would not purchase 8 filing cabinet with the names of all past, present, and future correspondents already indexed. It becomes quite evident that the Qabalistic cabinet (our thirty-two Paths) has a system of letters and numbers meaningless in them- selves, but as the files are completed, ready to take on a meaning, different for each student. As experience increased, each letter and number would receive fresh accessions of meaning and significance, and by adopting this orderly arrangement we would be enabled to grasp our inner life much more comprehensively than might otherwise be the case. The object of the theoretical (as separate from the Practical) Qabalah, insofar as this thesis is concerned, is to enable the student to do three main things: 37"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"38 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE SEPHIROS 39 First, to analyse every idea in terms of the Tree of Life. Second, to trace a necessary connection and relation between every and any class of ideas by referring them to this standard of comparison. Third, to translate any unknown system of symbolism into terms of any known one by its means. To restate the above in a different way, the art of using our filing cabinet arrangement brings home to us the com- mon nature of certain things, the essential difference between others, and the inevitable connection of all things. 1V!oreover, and this is extremely important, by the aequisi- bo~ of an understanding of anyone system of mystical phIlosophy or religion, one automatically acquires, when relating that comprehension to the Tree of Life, an under- standing of every system. So that ultimately, by a species of association of impersonal and abstract ideas, one gradually equilibrizes the whole of one's mental structure and obtains a simple view of the incalculably vast com- plexity of the universe. For it is written; \"Equilibrium is the basis of the work\". Serious students will need to make a careful study of the attributions detailed in this work and commit them to memory. When, by persistent application to his own mental apparatus, the numerical system with its corres- pondences is partly understood-as opposed to being merely memorized-the student will be amazed to find fresh light breaking in on him at every turn as he continues to refer every item in experience and consciousness to this standard. One Qabalist of recent years, Mr. Charles S. Jones (Frater Achad, pseud.), writes as follows in his Q. B. L. : \" It is of primary importance that the details of the Plan be Memorized. This is possibly the chief reason why in the early times the Qabalah was transmitted from mouth to ear and not in writing, for it only bears Fruit, insofar as it is first rooted in our minds. We may read of it, study it to some extent, juggle with it on paper, and so on, but Not Until the mind itself takes on the Image of the Tree and we are able to go mentally from Branch to Branch, Cor- respondence to Correspondence, visualizing the process and thus making it a Living Tree, do we find that the Light of Truth dawns upon us, and we have, as it were, succeeded in putting forth a shoot above the Earth, thus-as in the case of a young tree-finding ourselves in a new World, while yet our roots are firmly implanted in our natural clement.\" The Zohar itself speaks of a divine spiritual influence called ~\"'Tr.l Mezla, which descends from Kesel' to Malleus, by way of the Paths, vivifying and sustaining all things. By endeavouring to implant the roots of this living tree in our own consciousness, tending it daily with devo- tion, tenderness, and perseverance, almost imperceptibly we shall find new spiritual knowledge springing up SpOIl- taneously within us. The universe will then begin to appear as a synthetic homogeneous Whole.and the student will discover that the sum total of his knowledge will become unified, and find himself able to transmute even on the intellectual plane the Many into theOne. This is, in the long run, discarding all the inessentials, the goal of every mystic, no matter by which of the names he denomi- nates his Path, and which of the various by-roads he follows. One other preliminary matter must be touched upon before actually attempting an exegesis of the Sephiros. Many Qabal~sts have referred to the Tree of Life the seventy-eight Tarot cards, which are a series of pictorial representations of the universe. Eliphaz Levi writes in La Histoire de la Magie as follows: \"The absolute hiero- glyphical science had for its basis an alphabet of which all the gods were letters, all the letters ideas, all the ideas numbers, and all the numbers perfect signs, This hiero- glyphical alphabet, of which Moses made the great secret of his Cabalah, is the famous book of Thoth \", The leaves of this \"famous book\" are also called the Atus of Thoth, the latter being the Egyptian god of Wis- dom. Court de Gebelin (Paris, 1781) remarks; \"Were we to hear that there exists in our day a work of the ancient Egyptians, one of their books which had escaped the flames which devoured their superb libraries, and which contains their purest doctrines. . .. Were we to add that this book for several centuries had been accessible to everyone, would it not be surprising? And would not that surprise be at its height were it asserted that people have never suspected it"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"40 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE SEPffiROS 41 was Egyptian, that they possess it in such a manner that they can hardly be said to possess it at all, that no one has ever attempted to decipher a single leaf, and that the out- come of a recondite wisdom is regarded as a mass of extravagant designs which mean nothing in themselves? • • • • Yet this is a true fact. • • • In one word, this book is the pack of Tarot cards\". The legend as to the origin of these seventy-eight Atus is a most curious and interesting one indeed, although one cannot vouch for its accuracy. It goes that the Adepts of antiquity, seeing that a cycle of spiritual degradation and mental stagnation was about to descend upon Europe with the advent of what is called the Christian Era, were pre- occupied with the making of plans for the preservation of their accumulated knowledge. It would be held in reserve for the age when men would be sufficiently advanced and spiritually unbiased to receive it, and yet available during the intervening period, even during the cycle of complete intellectual slothfulness, so that any member of the com- munity who felt the inner urge to engage in the studies with which the Qabalah, in particular, deals would obtain easy access to it. In conference assembled within the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, they began considering the subject in all its aspects. One Adept had furthered the idea of reducing all their knowledge to a few symbols and glyphs, and hewing these into imperishable rock, as was done by King Asoka in India. Others were for the writing up of their knowledge as it stood, and storing the manuscripts in vast subter- ranean libraries (such as Blavatsky narrates exist to-day in Tibet), to be opened at a much later date. None of these, however, satisfied the majority as fulfilling the required conditions, until one Adept who had hitherto sat reclining, taking but little part in the discussions, spoke somewhat as follows: \"There is a much more practical yet subtle method. Let us reduce all our knowledge of man and the universe to symbols which can be portrayed in pictures suitable for use as an ordinary game. In such a manner, the accumulated wisdom of the ages will be preserved in an unorthodox way, passing unnoticed by the herd as being the Philosophy of the Initiates, and yet throwing more than a hint to one in search of the Truth.\" This suggestion, admirable in every way, was agreed upon by the Assembly, and one of their number, an Adept skilled in the work of brush, ink, and pen, painted a set of seventy- eight hieroglyphs, each representing symbolically some particular aspect of life, man, and the cosmos. And so these cards have come down to us to-day, intact, and practically unspoiled. It is true that some artists, neither skilled in the intricacies of the Holy Qabalah nor Adepts as were the originators of the cards, in painting copy sets of the Tarot cards have woefully misrepresented, misplaced, and in some cases entirely omitted some of the symbols existing on. the original set of pictures. Yet any one with a knowledge of the arcane wisdom can reconstruct them with case. It was only in the last century that we had the statement of Eliphaz Levi that were a man incarcerated in a dungeon cell in solitary confinement, without books or instructions of any kind, it would still be possible for him to obtain from this set of cards an encyclopredic knowledge of the essence of all sciences, religions, and philosophies. Ignoring this specimen of typical Levi verbosity, it is only necessary to point out that instead of using the ten digits and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet for the basis of his magical alphabet, Levi adopted as his fundamental framework the twenty-two trump cards of the Book of Thoth, attributing to them his knowledge and experience in a way similar to the attributions of the thirty-two Paths of Wisdom. Some critics have ventured the opinion that the inter- pretation of the Tree of Life suggested herein, its utilization as a mode of classification, does not\" ring true\" and that it has no authority in the standard works of the Qabalah. This criticism is utterly without foundation in fact. An attempt in this direction is most evident in the Sepher Yetzirah, and the Sepher haZohar is replete with the most recondite attributions, many of which I have not repro- duced here at all for the sake of maintaining simplicity. I can only recommend that those who bring forward these and similar objections should carefully refer to Mr. Waite's"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"42 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE SEPHIROS 43 epitome of Zoharic philosophy, The Secret Doctrine in Israel, which substantially demonstrates that the basis of my interpretation has the sanction of the highest Qabalistic authority. Let us now approach the exegesis of the Philosophy of the Qabalah in its various aspects. First we shall deal more fully with the ten Sephirothal ideas, giving the student in a later chapter examples of the mode of treatment which he himself will then be able to. follow in studying the attribu- tions of all the Paths. O. AIN The universe, as the sum total of all things and living creatures, is conceived as having its primeval origin in Infinite Space, l'~-Ain, Nothing, orParabrahmam, the Causeless Cause of all manifestation. To quote the Zohar: \" Before having created any shape in the world, before having produced any form, He was alone, without form, resembling nothing. Who could comprehend Him as He then was, before creation, since He had no form? \" The Ain is not a being; it is No-Thing. That which is incomprehensible, unknown, and unknowable does not exist-at least, to be more accurate, insofar as our own consciousness is concerned. Blavatsky defines this primal reality as an Omnipresent, Eternal, and Boundless prin- ciple on which all speculation is utterly impossible, since it so transcends the power of human conception and thought that it would only be dwarfed by any similitude. That which is known and named is known and named not from a knowledge of its substance but from its limitations. In itself, it is unknowable, unthinkable, and unspeakable. Rabbi Azariel ben Menahem (born 1160 A.D.), a disciple already mentioned of Isaac the Blind, states that the Ain can neither be comprehended by the intellect, nor described in words; for there is no letter or word to grasp it. In another very important system, this idea is very picturesquely and graphically represented as the goddess Nuit, the Queen of Absolute Space and the naked brilliance of the night sky blue-the Woman\" jetting forth the milk of the stars (cosmic dust) from her paps\". It is the Absolute or the Unknowable of the Agnosticism of Herbert Spencer; the thrice-great Darkness of the Egyptian sacerdotal caste; and the Chinese Tao which \"resemblcth the emptiness of space \", and which \" hath no Father; it is beyond all other conceptions, higher than the highest\". In one of the meditations of Chuang Tzu, we find that\" Tao cannot be existent. If it were existent, it could not be non-existent. • . . Tao is something beyond material existences. It cannot be conveyed, either by words or by silence. In that state whieh is neither speech nor silence, its transcendental nature may be appre- hended.\" To this Qabalistic conception 01' principle of Zero would be allocated Baruch Spinoza's definition of God or Substance: \"That which requires for its conception, the conception of no other thing\". Another of the many symbols used by the Hindus to represent this Zero was that of the serpent Ananta, which enclosed the universe; its tail being swallowed in its mouth represented the re-entrant nature of Infinity. I. KESER To become conscious of Itself, or to render itself com- prehensible to itself, Ain becomes J:)'P l'l'ol Ain Soph (Infinity), and still further .,,~ J:1'o l'~ ;Ain Soph Aour, Absolute Limitless Light (the Daivaprakriti of the Brahman Vedantists, and the Adi-Buddha or Amitabha of the Budd- hists); which then by contraction (Tsimtsum, according to the Zohar)conc.entratcd itself into a central dimensionless Point-[(cscr, the Crown, which is.the first Sephirah on the Tree of Lifc. Another way in which this same idea has been expressed is that within the concept of abstract negativity, the Whirling Forces (Rashis haGiZgolim) presage the first mani- festation of the Primordial Point (Nelcudah Rishonah), which becomes the primeval root from which all else will spring. Keseris the inscrutable Monad, the root of all things, defined by Leibnitz with reference both to the ulti- mate nature of physicalthings and to the ultimate unit of consciousness, as a metaphysical point, a centre of spiritual energy, un extended and indivisible, full of ceaseless life,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"ac~i:vity, and. force. It is the prototype of everything spiritual and, indeed, of all else in the cosmos. In this connection the reader will do well to bear in mind the following extract from The Mysterious Universe wherein Sir James Jeans writes: \"This shows that an electron must, in a certain sense at least, occupy the whole of space. • • • They (Faraday and Maxwell) pictured an electrified particle • • • which threw out •.• 'lines of force', throughout the whole of space\" (p.54-5). The scientific conception of the mathematical electron which occupies\" the whole of space\" would correspond to the Qabalistic conception of Kesel' in the World of Assiah. The four worlds are explained in Chapter Seven. In the Qabalah are included what are known as the ten Sephiros. There is some little speculation as to what these imply-ten Numbers, ten Words, or ten Sounds? The general implication of Cordovero is that they are substan- ~ive principles or kehlim, vessels of force, or categorical Ideas through which the Consciousness of the universe expresses itself. A metaphorical passage from the Zohar states on this point that: \" The waters of the sea are limitless and shapeless. But when they are spread over the earth, they produce a shape. . . . The source of the waters of the sea, and the force which it emits to spread itself over the soil, are two things. Then an immense basin is formed by the waters just as is formed when one makes a very deep digging. This basin is filled by the waters which emanate from the source' it is . ' the sea Itself and can be regarded as a third thing. This very large hollow of waters is split up into seven canals, which are like so many long tubes by means of which the waters are conveyed. The source, the current, the sea, and the seven canals form together the number Ten. • • .\" The passage then goes on to explain that the source or primary Cause of all things is Kesel', the first Sephirah ; the current issuing therefrom, the primeval mercurial intel- ligence, is Chokmah, the second; and the sea itself is the Great Mother, Binah, the third; the seven canals referred to being the seven lower Sephiros, or Inferiors as they are called. The Qabalists postulated ten Sephiros because to 45 , I I I , I I I I , I I , , \" , , \"- \" \" \" \" \" THE SEPHIROS I I I I I I I I I I I ----------r--------- I I I I I I I I I I I , , , , , \" , , , , \" , , , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ Diagram No.2 THE TRIAD SUPERNAL soliloquizes that: \"The number ten is an all-embracing number. Outside of it there exists no other, for what is beyond ten returns again to units.\" Kesel', the Crown, is then the first Sephirah. As the first Cause or Demiurgos, it is also called Macroprosopus, or the Great Countenance, in the Zohar. The number One has them ten was a perfect number, one which included every digit without repetition, and contained the total essence of all numbers. Isaac Myers writes that 0-1 ends with 1-0, and Rabbi Moses Cordovero, in his Pardis Rimonim, A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES 44"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"46 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE SEPHIROS 47 been defined by Theon of Smyrna as \"the principal and element of numbers which, while multitude can be less- ened by subtraction and is itself deprived of every number, remains stable And firm\". The Pythagoreans said that the Monad is the beginning of all things, and gave it, according to Photius, the names of God, the First of all things, the Maker of all things. It is the source of Ideas. To each Sephirah, the doctrinal Qabalah attributes intel- ligences variously called Gods, Dhyan Chohans, Angels, and Spirits, etc., for the whole universe in this philosophy is guided and animated by whole series of these hierarchies of sentient beings, each with a particular function and mission, varying in their respective degrees and states of conscious- ness and intelligence. There is but one indivisible and absolute consciousness thrilling throughout every particle and infinitesimal point in the manifested universe in Space. But its first differentiation, by emanation or reflection, is purely spiritual and gives rise to a number of \" beings\" which we may call Gods, their consciousness being of such a nature, of such a degree of sublimity, as to surpass our comprehension. From one point of consideration, the \" Gods\" are the forces of Nature; their\" Names\" are the laws of Nature; they are therefore eternal, omnipresent, and omnipotent-only, however, for the cycle of time, almost infinite though it be, wherein they are manifested or projected. The names of the Gods arc important, for, according to magical doctrine, to know thc namc of an intelligence is at once to possess peculiar control of it. Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie, in his little work on The Religion of Ancient Egypt, states that \"the knowledge of the name gave power over its owner\". We find attributed to the Crown, the first digit, the attribution of the God-name of n'i1~ Ahieh, translated by \"I will be\", signifying definitely that the scheme of Nature is not a static one nor a system of existence wherein the creative processes have long been consummated, but vibrant, progressive, and ever-becoming. Its Egyptian Gods are Ptah who, again according to Prof. Flinders Petrie, was one of the abstract Gods (as distinguished from human 01' cosmic gods) and the creator of the cosmic egg; and Amon-Ra (with whom Osiris became identified) king of the Gods and \" lord of the thrones of the world\". Its Greek equivalent is Zeus-identified in the Roman theogony as Jupiter-the greatest of the Olympian Gods, and is generally represented as the omnipotent father and king of Gods and Men. The Romans considered Jupiter as the Lord of Heaven, the highest and most powerful among the Gods, and called him the Best and Most High. In the Indian systems, he is Brahma the creator, from whom sprang the seven Prajapati-e-our seven lowest Sephiros- who, at his behest, completed the creation of the world. The Diamond is attributed to Kesel', because it is the most permanent and glittering of precious jewels. For various reasons, too, the ancients made the Swan a corres- pondence of this digit. In the legends of all peoples, the Swan is the symbol of Spirit and Ecstasy. The Hindu legends narrate that the Swan (Hansa) when given milk mixed with water for its food separated the two, drinking the milk and leaving the water-this being supposed to show its transcendent wisdom. The Hawk also isa corres- pondence. Bearing in mind that Keseris. the Monad, the individual point-of-view, we can understand that the Hawk is so attributed because it has the habit of remaining poised in mid-air, looking down from the blue eether to earth and beholding all things with the eye of utter detachment. Ambergris, that rarest and most precious of perfumes- while having little perfume in itself is most admirable as the basis of compounds, bringing out the best of any other with which it may be mixed-finds its place in this category of ideas. The colour attributed to Keser is White, its Tarotic attributions are the four Aces, and it is called in the Sepher Yetsirah \" The Admirable or Hidden Intelligence\". According to Rabbi Azariel's Commentary on the Ten Sephiros each of the Sephiros has three distinct qualities. First, it has its own Sephirothal function, already described. Its secondary aspect is that it receives from the previous Sephiros, or from above, in the case of Keser; and third, it transmits its own nature, and that received from above, to those Sephiros below."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"48 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE SEPHIROS 49 II. CIIOKMAH The first Sephirah (the essence of Being-Spirit-Matter) contained in essence and potentiality the other nine Sephiros and gave rise to them in a process which can be mathematically stated. S. Liddell McGregor Mathers asks, \"How is Number Two to be found?\" He answers the question in his Introduction to the Kabbalah Unveiled: \" By reflection of itself. For although 0 be incapable of definition, 1 is definable. And the effect of a definition is to form an Eidolon, duplicate or image, of the thing defined. Thus, then, we obtain a duad composed of 1 and its reflec- tion. Now, also, we have the commencement of a vibration established, for the number 1 vibrates alternately from changelessness to definition and back to changelessness.\" Isaac Ibn Latif (1220-1290 A.D.) also furnishes us with a mathematical definition of the processes of evolution: \" As the point extends, and thickens into a line, the line into the plane, the plane into the expanded body, so God's manifestation unfolds itself.\" If we try for a moment to think what is the ultimate differentiation of Existence, we shall find that so far as we can grasp it it is a plus and minus, positive and negative, male and female, and so we should expect on the Tree of Life to find that the two emanations succeeding Keser par~ take of these characteristics. We ascertain that the second Sephirah, Chokmah or Wisdom, is male, vigorous and active. It is called the Father, the divine name being it' Yoh, and the choir of Angels appropriate ' being the Ophanim, Tahuti or Thoth is attributed to this Sephirah of Wisdom, for he was the god of writing, learning, and magick. Thoth is represented as an Ibis-headed God, and occasionally has an ape or baboon in attendance. Pallas Athena, insofar as she is the giver of intellectual gifts and one in whom power and wisdom were harmoniously blended, the Goddess of Wisdom who sprang full-armed from the brain of Zeus, is attributed to Chokmah. In Greek mythology, she appeared as the preserver of human life, and instituted the ancient court of the Areopagus at Athens. She is also Minerva in the Roman system, whose name is considered by philolo- gists to contain the root of mens, to think; she is accord- ingly the thinking power personified. Maat, the Goddess of Truth, linked with Thoth, is another Egyptian corres- pondence. Uranus, as the starry heavens, and Hermes as the Logos and the Transmitter of the influence from Keser, also are attributions. In Taoism, the positive Yang would correspond to this Sephirah. Chokmah is the vital energizing element of existence, Spirit or the Purusha of the Sankhyan philosophy of India, by which is implied the basic reality underlying all mani- festations of Consciousness. In Blavatsky's system, Chokmah would be what is there named Mahat or H Cosmic Ideation\". With the Buddhists of China, this is K wan Shi Yin; Vishnu and Ishvara with the Hindus. Chokmah is the Word, the Greek Logos, and the Memrah of the Tar- gum. The Sepher Yetsirah names it \"The Illuminatin~ Intelligence\"; its planet is Uranus-although tradi- tionally the Sphere of the Zodiac is allocated thereto. Its colour is grey; its perfume the orchitic Musk, plant the Amaranth, which is the flower of immortality ; and the Four Twos of the Tarot. Its precious stones are the Star Ruby representing the male energy of the creative Star, and the Turquoise suggesting Mazlos, the Sphere of the Zodiac. ' The Zohar also attributes to Chokmah the first letter Yod , of the Tetragrammaton YHVH, a formula which will be more fully explained later. The Yod also has attributed to it the Four Kings of the Tarot. The attribu- tions of the Tetragrammaton should be very carefully followed, for much of Zoharic speculation devolves upon them. III. BINAR Chokmah gives rise to Binah, the third Sephirah, Aimah the Mother, which is negative, female, and passive. It will be necessary to consult the accompanying diagram, to note the formation of the Tree as it proceeds. Three is Binah, then, translated by Understanding, and to it is attributed Saturn, the oldest of the Gods, and the Greek Krenos, the God of Time. She is Frigg, the wife of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"origin within the dark womb of the oyster. Its Yetsiratic title is \" The Sanctifying Intelligence\"; its sacred plants, the Cypress, Lily, and Opium Poppy; and the Tarot cards appropriate are the four Threes. Its symbol is the brooding dove-the true Shechinah, or Holy Spirit. The letter of Tetragrammaton is the first Heh rt, and the Tarot attribu- tion is the four Queens. The first three Sephiros, denominated the Supernals, transcend in every possible way all intellectual conceptions, and can only bc realized by specialized training in medita- tion and practical Qabalah. The Supernals are separated by a great gulf, the Abyss, from that which lies below them. The Supernals are Ideal; the other Sephiros are Actual ; the Abyss is the metaphysical gap between. In one sense they have no connection or relation with the Inferiors, the lower seven Sephiros, reflected by them-just as Space itself is independent of, and unaffected by, whether there-is or is not anything manifested within its emptiness. The cause of the appearance of Kesel', the first Sephirah, the central dimensionless Point, arouses tremendous prob- lems. Lao Tsu teaches us that: \"Tao produced Unity, Unity produced Duality, Duality produced Trinity, and Trinity produced all existing things.\" The doctrinal Qabalah of Rabbi Azariel implies that Ain Soph in order to create the World (the tenth Sephirah) was unable to do so directly, but did so through the medium of Kesel', which in turn evolves the other Sephiros or potencies, culminating in Malkus and the external universe. The Zohar restates this hypothesis. But there is a difficulty, since it is obviously impossible for so abstract a conception as Zero to do any- thing. Blavatsky in her monumental work, The Secret Doctrine, recognizes the difficulty, and endeavours to solve the problem by stating that the Absolute (Ain) while incomprehensible in itself, has several aspects from which we can view it-Infinite Space, Eternal Duration, and Absolute Motion. The latter aspect is graphically con- ceived under the Hindu expression of the Great Breath of Brahma, ever coming and going, creating and destroying the worlds. With the cyclic inhalation the universe is withdrawn and ceases to exist; but with the exhalation, 50 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES the ~ orse Odin, and mother of all the Gods.

SaktI?s that universal electric vital power which unites an? brings together all forms, the constructive power that carnes. o~t, In t~e f~rmation of things, the plan of the TI~ought DIVme, which IS Chokmah. Binah is Maya, the u.~lversal power of Illusion, Kwan Yin of Chinese Budd- hism, the Yin of Taoism, the goddess Kali of the orthodox Hindu religions and the Great Sea wherefrom we are sprung. The Hindu four-armed image of Kali is most graphic. From her neck hangs a garland of skulls and round her waist is a girdle of human arms-made of gold. In her lower left hand she holds a decapitated human head, also ~ade of gold, and in the upper a sword. With her lower right hand she offers boons to her devotees, with the upper a symbol ~o fear naught. The skulls and the sword represent her ~emble destructive side, Kali j and her right hands offering boons and fearlessness, her benignant side similar ~o that conve~ed by the Egyptian conception of Isis. She IS bot~ terrible and sweet-like Nature, alternately destroymg and creating. In the Theosophical system, one aspect of Binah is Mulaprakriti, or cosmic root substance, which as Blavatsky s~ates must be regarded as objectivity in its purest abstrac- tion-s-the self-existing basis whose differentiations consti- tute the objective reality underlying the phenomena of every phase of conscious existence. It is that subtle form of ro?t. matter which we touch, feel, and breathe without per- c~lvmg, look at without seeing, hear and smell without the slightest cognition of its existence. The Qabalah of Isaac Mye:s lays down the principle that matter (the spiritual passive substan?e of ~bn. Gabirol) always corresponds with the female passrve principle to be influenced by the active or the male, the formative principle. In short, Binah is the sUbstantiv~ vehicle of every possible phenomenon, physical or mental, Just as Chokmah is the essence of consciousness. !ts colour is black, since it is negative and receptive of all things ; the precious stone attributed hereto being the Pearl, on acco~nt of its being the typical stone of the sea, and also referring to the manner in which the pearl has its THE SEPHIROS 51"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Diagram No.3 THE SECOND TRIAD \\ I I \\ I I \\ I I \\ I I \\ I I \\ I I \\ I I \\ I I --~--- - --1\"- - -- -.,..-- \\ I I \\ I I \\ I \\ I I / \\ I I / \" \\ I I , \\ I I / , \\ I I / , \\ I I I '\\ I I \\ \\ !

The Scpher Yetsirali gives it the title of \" Receptacular Intel- ligence \". Because of the watery aspect of this Sephirah, we find the correspondence of Poseidon the ruler of the seas in mythology, and Jupiter, or rather that aspect of him which was originally, in earliest Rome, an elemental or tutelary divinity, worshipped as the God of Rain, Storms, and 52 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES, IV. CHESED Number Four called Chesed-Mercy, begins the second Triad of Sephiros which is the reflection of the Supernal Triad beyond the Abyss. The three primary or elementary colours are attributed to the Sephiros of this second trinity; blue to Chesed, red to Geburah, and Yellow to Tipharas. The fourth to the ninth Sephiros inclusive are known as the Sephiros habinyon-the Potencies of Construction, and Myers holds that they symbolize the dimensions of matter, be it an atom or an universe: the four directions of space (according to the Sepher Yetsirah) and the positive and negative poles of each of these. Chesed is male and positive, although the feminine quality of \\J Water is attributed. The Zohar gives Chesed another title n';1ru Gedulah, Majesty or Greatness, both of which are qualities of the great astrological benefic manifestation commences with the appearance of a laya or neutral centre which we call Keser. This cyclic or periodic law of cosmic manifestation cannot be anything other than the Will of the Absolute to manifest. In which case, we are necessitated, in all accuracy, to fall back on to the old postulate that the Absolute manifests the laya point or Keser from which, eventually, all is to evolve. The view of another system is that the universe is the eternal love play (lila in Sanskrit) of two forces, the positive being the central point-Badit; the negative Absolute Space. The latter, depicted as the Queen of Space, Nuit- the\" blue-lidded daughter of Sunset\" is conceived as say- ing: \"For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing and the joy of dissolution all.\" In view of our Qabalistic. doctrine, however, of the inadequacy of the intellectual faculties to solve these insuperable philosophical problems-a fact which a num- ber of loquacious Qabalists constantly ignore or forget-it would be as well, and much more sensible, to admit that logically we cannot account for the existence of the first Sephirah from which everything else has been evolved."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"54 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE SEPHIROS 55 Thunder. His Greek equivalent would be Zeus armed with thunder and lightning, the shaking of whose regis produces storm and tempest. The Hindu attribution is Indra, lord of fire and lightning.

JEger, the God of the Sea, in the Norse Sagas, might also be placed in this category; and the legends imply that he was skilled also in magiek, 7+, then, we find is the planet governing that operation of practical l\\Iagick called the Formula of Tetragrammaton. Its Angels are said to be the \" Brilliant Ones\", and· its Archangel is Tsadkiel, meaning the Righteousness of God. The animals sacred to Chesed are the Unicorn and the Horse, the latter because Poseidon in legend created the horse and taught men the noble art of managing horses by the bridle. Its plants are the Pine, Olive, and Shamrock; its stone the Amethyst and Sapphire; Blue is its colour, and the Tarot attributions are the four Fours, its metal being Tin, and its perfume Cedar. v. GEBURAR Chesed gives rise to Geburah, which is essentially a reflec- tion of Binah. Geburah, meaning Strength or Power, is the fifth Sephirah, feminine, and to it is given the Divine Name of \",::1:1 1:J'i1?~ Elohim Gibor, the Mighty Gods. Despite the fact that Geburah is a feminine potency, as are all the Sephiros on the left-hand column of the Tree, practically all its attributions are male and vigorous. There is an old alchemical aphorism, \"Man is peace, and Woman is Power\". This concept is borne out in the Qabalistic system. The three Sephiros, all male, of the right-hand column, are called the Pillar of Mercy; whereas those three feminine Sephiros on the left constitute the Pillar of Severity. Most of the attributions given to Chesed, the male Sephirah, are feminine in quality. This is not confusion of thought but a recognition of the necessity for equilibrium. The gods of Geburah are Mars who, evenin popular par- lance, is the accredited God of War, and Ares of the Greeks, who is depicted as delighting in the din and roar of battle, in the slaughter of men and in the destruction of towns. Geburah represents on a much lower plane the Sakti force-element attributed to Binah. Nephthys, the Lady of Severity, the shadowy double and sister of Isis, is attributed to this digit 5, and so we would naturally expect her to manifest in this Sephirah a quality similar to that of Binah, but much less pure as an abstract spiritual force. Thor is the Norwegian War God, and according to the Sagas, a scarlet cloud above his head reflected the fiery glint in his eyes; he was girded with strength and armour and was drawn to battle in a chariot. The magical weapons of Geburah are the Sword, Spear, Scourge, and Burin, all suggesting warfare and blood- letting. Its metal is Iron, and its sacred tree the Oak, both these attributions being quite obvious as implying strength. In fact, the quality of Geburah is summed up in the general idea of strength and power and force. It has been suggested that these fourth and fifth Sephiros represent the expansive and contracting, centripetal, and centrifugal energies between the poles of the dimensions. acting under the will of the Logos, Chokmah. Tobacco and the Nettle are correspondences, both because of their fiery and stinging nature. Its colour is red, obviously martial; and hence the ruby, which is bright scarlet, is harmonious. Its sacred creature is the legendary Basilisk of the staring eye, and the Tarot cards are the four Fives. According to the Sepher Yetsirah, Geburah is named \" The Radical Intelligence\". VI. TIPHARAS The action of the fourth and fifth Sephiros, male and female, produce in reconciliation Tipharas, which is Beauty and Harmony. The diagram will show it in the centre of the whole Sephirothal system comparable to a Sun-which indeed is its astrological attribution-with the planets revolving around it. Its gods arc Ra, the Egyptian solar god who is sometimes represented as a hawk-headed divinity and at others by a simple solar disk with two wings attached; the Sun God of the Greeks, Apollo, in whom the brightest side of the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"56 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE SEPHIROS 57 Grecian mind is reflected. From Walter Pater's Greek Studies we learn that: \"Apollo, the 'spiritual form' of sunbeams, easily becomes (the merely physical element in his constitution being almost wholly suppressed) exclusively ethical-the , spiritual form' of inward or intellectual light, in all its manifestations. He represents all those specially European ideas, of a reasonable polity; of the sanity of soul and body ••. his religion is a sort of embodied equity, its aim being the realization of fair reason and just consideration of the truth of things everywhere.\" A parallel conception is found in that section of the Zohar entitled ldra Zuta: Tipharas is \" the highest manifestation of ethical life, the sum of all goodness; in short, the Ideal\". Hari, the Hindu attribution, is another name for Shri Krishna the divine Avatara, attributed here because, being a divine incarnation-one in whom both Spirit and Matter were in complete equilibrium-he expressed the essential idea implied in Tipharas. Adonis, Iacchus, Rama, and Asar are other correspondences for 6, either because of their inherent nature of beauty, or because they represent in one way or another the solar disk, to which all mystical psycho- logy, ancient and modern, is unanimous in attributing the spiritual consciousness. The Sepher haZohar denominates the hexagram of Sephiros clustered about Tipharas as the Microprosopus, or the Lesser Countenance. Dionysius is another god in the category of 6, because of his youth and gracious form, combining effeminate softness and beauty, or because of his cultivation of the vine which, ceremonially used in the Eleusinian mysteries, produced a spiritual intoxication analogous to the mystical state. It may be, too, because Dionysius is said to have transformed himself into a lion, which is the sacred animal of Tipharas, being the king of wild beasts, and regality has always been depicted in the form of the lion. Astrological reasons may explain this parallelism for 8 Sol is exalted in the zodiacal sign of ·stLeo, the Lion, which was considered to be a creative symbol of the fierce mien of the midsummer sun. Bacchus, another name of Dionysius for purposes of worship, is the god of intoxication, of inspiration, a giver of superhuman or immortal life. In his Notes on the Bacclus of EU1'ipides, Prof. Gilbert Murray writes, with regard to Orphism : \" All true worshippers become in a mystical sense one with the God; they are born again and are 'Bacchoi '. Dionysius being the God within, the perfectly pure soul is possessed by the God wholly and becomes nothing but the God.\" The Scandinavian correspondence is in all probability the God Balder, the favourite of all Nature, the son of Odin and Frigg. Anderson writes that \"it may be truly said of him that he is the best god, and all mankind are loud in his praise \". In addition to the lion, the sacred animal of Tipharas is the fabulous Phoenix who tears open her breast so that her seven, young ones may feed upon the blood stream and vitality issuing from her wound. The Pelican has a similar legend attached to it. They both suggest the idea of a B;edeemer giving his life for others, and Murray gives in hIS Introductory Notes above mentioned, an interesting anecdote with a very similar implication: \"SemeIe~ ?-aughter of Cadmus, being loved by Zeus, asked her divine lover to appear to her once in his full glory; he came, a blaze of miraculous lightning, in the ecstasy of which Semele died, giving premature birth to a son.

In his Greek Studies Walter Pater wrote: \"Victory again, meant originally, mythologic science tells us, only the great victory of the sky, the triumph of morning over darkness. But that physical morning of her origin has its ministry to the later resthetic sense also. For if Nike, when she appears in company with the mortal, and wholly fleshly hero, in whose chariot she stands to guide the horses, or whom she crowns with her garland of parsley or bay, or whose names she writes on a shield, is imaginatively conceived, it is because the old skyey influences are still not quite suppressed in her clear-set eyes, and the dew of the morning still clings to her wings and her floating hair.\" Astrologically its planet is Venus P, It should follow in consequence from this that the gods and qualities of Net- sach relate to Love, Victory, and to the harvest. Aphro- dite (Venus) is the Lady of Love and Beauty, with the power of bestowing her beauty and charms to others. The whole implication of this Sephirah is of love-albeit a love of a sexual nature. Hathor is the Egyptian equivalent and is a lesser aspect of the Mother Isis. She is depicted as a cow goddess, representing the generative forces of Nature, and she was the protectress of agriculture and the fruits of the earth. Bhavani is the Hindu goddess of Netsach. Rose is the flower appurtenant, and Red Sandal is the perfume. It is common knowledge that in some diseases of a venereal (~) origin oils of sandalwood are employed. Benzoin is a perfume of Venus, too, and its sensuous seduc- tiveness is unmistakable. The Rose is attributed as being harmonious to the character of Aphrodite. The Sepher Yetsirah calls Netsach \"The Occult Intelli- gence \"; its colour is Green, being derived from the union of the blue and yellow of Chesed and Tipharas; and its Tarot cards are the four Sevens.

It is the endless, changeless, ebb and flow of the world's forces that, in the last resort, guarantee the stability of the world and provides its foundation. Yesod is this stable foundation, this change- less ebb and flow of astral forces, and the universal repro- ductive power in Nature. \"Everything shall return to its foundation, from which it has proceeded. All marrow, seed, and energy are gathered in this place. Hence all the potentialities which exist go out through this\" (Zohar).

Its Hindu equivalent is Ganesha, the elephant God who breaks down all obstacles, and supports the universe while himsel~standing. on a tortoise. Diana was the Goddess of LIght and In the Roman Temples represented the moon. The general conception of Yesod is of change with stability.

An important consideration, from the practical Qabalistic viewpoint, is the attribution of the moon which, according to the occult tradition, is a dead yet living body whose particles are full of active and destructive life, of potent magical power. 60 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES order to give some idea of the implication of this Sephirah, an understanding of Her~es, the Greek God attributed to it, will be helpful. He IS a God of Prudence and Cunning, Shrewdness and Sagacity, and is regarded as the author of a variety of inventions such as the alphabet,mathematics, astronomy, and weights and measures. He also presided over commerce and good luck, and was the messenger and herald of the Olympians. According to Virgil, the gods employed him to conduct the souls of the deceased from the upper to the lower worlds. In this latter capacity, the Egyptian jackal-headed Anub~s is similar since he was the patron of the dead, and IS depicted ~s leading the soul into the jUdgmen~ of <?siris in Amennti. It will help the student not a little If he remembers that the sphere of Hod represents on. ~ ve~y much lower plane similar qualities to those obtaining In Chokmah. Of N etsach and Hod, the seventh and eighth Sephiros, the Zohar soliloquizes that by Victory and Splendour is meant extension, multiplication, and force; because all ~he forces which were born into the universe went out of their bosom. The Hindu God is Hanuman, represented by an Ape or Monkey. Blavatsky gives at great length, in The Secret Doctrine the interesting theory that within the apes are imprisoned the human souls of a solar-mercurial nature, souls almost of the status of Godhead, called Manasaputras, \"Mind-born sons of Brahma\"; which may explain why the Hindu gods of Mind and Intelligence are represent.ed by so, apparently, an unintelligent beast as the anthrop?Id.

MALKUS Pendant to the system of three Triads, and synthesizing all the former numbers, is Malkus, the Kingdom-the tenth Sephirah. Malkus is the world of the four elements, matter in its entirety, and all the forms perceived by our five senses, summing up in a crystallization the former nine digits or series of ideas. Seb is the Egyptian God attributed to Malkus, since he is figured with the head of a crocodile, the Egyptian hiero- glyph of gross matter. Psyche, the lower Nephthys and the unmarried Isis, are other gods attributed. The Virgin, or the Bride, is another Zoharic title for Malkus, used however in a particular sense which will be considered in Chapter Five. Persephone is the virgin Earth and her legends indicate the adventures of the unredeemed soul; and Ceres is the maiden Goddess of the Earth, too. Other deities are Lakshmi and the Sphinx, all attributed as representing the fertility of the earth and of all creatures. In :ftlalkus, the lowest of the Sephiros, the sphere of the physical world of matter, wherein incarnate the exiled N eschamos from the Divine Palace, there abides the Shechinah, the spiritual Presence of Ain Soph as a heritage to mankind and an ever-present reminder of spiritual verities. That is why there is written\" Keser is in Malkus, and Malkus is in Keser, though after another manner\". The Zohar would imply that the real Shechinah, the real Divine Presence, is allocated to Binah whence it never descends, but that the Shechinah in Malkus is an eidolon or Daughter of the Great Supernal Mother. Isaac Myer suggests that: \"It is considered by Qabalists as the executive energy or power of Binah, the Holy Spirit or the Upper Mother.\" The Sepher Yetsirah denominates Malkus as \"The Resplendent Intelligence\". Its perfume is Dittany of Crete because of the heavy clouds of dense smoke given off by this incense. Its colours are Citrine, Olive, Russet, and Black, and its Tarot cards are the four Tens.

World"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"64 'A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES Before proceeding to consider in the next chapter the numerous correspondences which appertain to the twenty- two Paths on the Tree of Life, I feel it imperative to utter a word of warning with regard to a possible misconstruction that might be placed on some of the attributions which have been given to these Sephiros and Paths. For example, Tobacco, Mars, the Basilisk, and the Sword are among those qualities which belong to the filing jacket of Geburah, or the fifth Sephirah. Yet the reader must here beware of making the almost unpardonable error of con- fusing the logical premisses. Since all of these are corres- pondences of the number 5, then Tobacco is a Sword, and the God Mars is an equivalent of the Basilisk. This is a real danger, and a tremendous mistake of serious consequence. At the outset of the comparative study that is here being presented, the basic implication of this method of classifica- tion of the correspondences selected from comparative religions and philosophy should be thoroughly grasped. In this instance, all of the four things mentioned above possess a certain quality or set of attributes of a similar nature, which renders them in harmony with the filing jacket to which they have been attributed. There is an underlying connection which associates them with the number 5. This idea must be kept in mind throughout if any benefit is to be derived from the Qabalah, and all confusion banished at the beginning. CHAPTER FOUR THE PATHS 0 · .: NE ?f. the sev. eral difficulties en. countered in pre- sentmg a new scheme or a new interpretation of philosophy is the popular prejudice against new terminology. It is conceivable that objections will be raised against the Hebrew Alphabet and the terms utilized ?y the Qabalah by people who may overlook the fact that III the study of Astronomy, Physics, or Chemistry, for example, a completely new nomenclature must be mastered. Even Commerce uses a whole system of words and terms meaningless without a knowledge of commercial methods and procedure. The terminology used by the Qabalah is so employed for several reasons. In Hebrew there are no numerals (which derive from the Moors), but each letter ofthe alphabet is used for a number. This fact provides the basis whereon the Qabalah rests in deviating from ordinary ideas of numbers and letters. EachHebrew letter has a multiple value. First, it has its individual position in the alphabet; second, it has a numerical value; third, it is attributed to some one of the thirty-two Paths on the Tree of Life; fourth, it has a Tarot card attribution; and fifth, it has a definite symbol or allegorical meaning when spelled in full. Blavatsky writes: \"Every Cosmogony from the earliest to the latest is based upon, interlinked with, and most closely related to, numerals and geometrical figures ..•. Hence we find numbers and figures used as an expression and a record of thought in every archaic scripture.\" Ginsburg, referring to the Hebrew Alphabet, states: \"Since the letters have no absolute value-nor can they be used as mere forms, but serve as the medium between essence and forms, and like words, assume the relation of form to the real essence, and of essence to the embryo and unexpressed 65"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"66 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE PATHS 67 thought-great value is attached to these letters, and to the combinations and analogies of which they are capable.\" The Tarot trumps furnish a complete set of symbols, but the great difficulty hitherto experienced in their attribution to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet is that these trump cards are numbered from I to XXI, accom- panied by another card marked 0, which has always been the stumbling-block, being attributed by various people to various letters of the alphabet, depending-apparently- on their whim at any particular moment. It should be quite obvious that the only logical place for this Zero card is antecedent to I, and when so placed the cards assume a definite sequential meaning, profoundly explanatory of the letters. It is essential here to make a remark regarding the nature of the symbols revealed by the Tarot and utilized by the Zohar and Sepher Yetsirah. The symbolism which is so often definitely and decidedly phallic is merely utilized in order to make cosmic and metaphysical conceptions and processes more readily comprehensible to the human mind. Blavatsky was repeatedly offended by the use of sexual symbolism and on this account attacked the Qabalistic modes of expression in heated vituperations. Her indigna- tion was quite unnecessary, for in the Qabalah no lascivious method of interpretation has ever been used. I cannot undertake satisfactorily to account for her dislike of the Qabalah. The only explanation which seems even remotely possible is that issuing, as she did, from a noble family in Russia, where anti-Semitism was rife in her day, any and everything that smacked of Jewish savour was thoroughly objectionable. Her repeated attacks on the Zoharists, plus her real ignorance of the books of the Qabalah--corro- borated by the fact that she quotes mainly from Levi (who knew but little of it) and Knorr von Rosenroth, both of whom were Roman Catholics-may perhaps be explained in this manner. Phallic symbolism was used very largely because it was conceived that the creative process in the Macrocosm is parallel, in a marked degree, to that in the little world of man. Nicholas Roerich's excellent travel book entitled Altai-Himalaya gives a fine appreciation of this viewpoint: \"Observe how remarkable are the physiological com- parisons traced by the Hindus between cosmic manifesta- tions and the human organism. The womb, the navel, the phallus, and the heart, all these long since have been included in the fine system of development of the universal celL\" And while on this subject of phallicism, one is obliged to refer to C. J. Jung's Psychology of the Unconscious, accord- ing to which there is a gross misunderstanding of the term sexuality. By the latter, Freud understands\" love\" and includes therein all those tender feelings and emotions which have had their origin in a primitive erotic source, even if now their primary aim is entirely lost and another substituted for it. And it must also be borne in mind that the psycho-analysts themselves strictly emphasize the psychic side of sexuality and its importance besides its somatic expression. The Sepher Yetsirah states: \" Twenty-two basal letters. He drew them, hewed them, weighed them, interchanged them, and formed by their means the whole creation, and everything that should be subsequently created.\" This quotation is fundamental in the number philosophy of the Qabalah, indicating that the existence of these letters and the impress which they leave in every particle of creation, constitutes the harmony of the cosmos. The idealistic position that thoughts are things is analogous, and in the Sepher Yetsirah, the twenty-two letters or sets of ideas are observed to be the underlying forms and essences which go to make up the whole manifested universe in all its variety. The Tree of Life consists of the thirty-two Paths of Wisdom, of which the ten Sephiros are considered to be the main Paths or branches whose correspondences are by far the most important, and the twenty-two letters the lesser Paths connecting the Sephiros, harmonizing and equili- brizing the concepts attached to the various numbers. In dealing with these remaining twenty-two Paths, the same procedure will be followed as with the Sephiros, going over each item, giving several correspondences, paying particular attention to the shape and meaning of the letters, together"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"68 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE PATHS 69 Diagram No.6 THE PATHS with relevant matter concerning their pronunciation which seems never to have been systematically presented before in treatises on the Number Philosophy' of the Qabalah.

This is highly significant, for the letter when pronounced as Aleph and spelt in full l')\"'~ ALPh, means an Ox or Bull, an admirable symbol to denote the generative power of Nature. To Aleph is attributed the Swastika y;, almost H in shape, or the Thunderbolt of Thor-an excellent glyph to express the concept of the primeval motion of the Great Breath, whirling Chaos into a creative centre. Aleph partakes ofthe nature of Keser, and is called\" The Scintillating Intelligence\". Hoor-paar-Kraat, the Egyp- tian Lord of Silence, depicted as holding his finger to his lips, is attributed here; as are Zeus and Jupiter, with par- ticular reference to that aspect of these two gods as elemental portions of Nature. The Hindu attribution is the Maruts (Vayu) having reference to the airy aspect of Aleph, as also do the Valkyries of the Scandinavian Pantheon. The animal appropriate to Aleph is the Eagle, the king of the birds, since we learn from classical mythology that the Eagle was sacred to Jupiter; whose sacrifices, I may add, generally consisted ofbulIs and cows. Its element is Air A>, rushing aimlessly hither and thither, always pressing or tending in a downward direction. Its Tarot trump is O-The Fool, implying just this airy aimlessness of existence.

He points to the ground with his left hand, thus affirming the magical formula that\" that which is above is like unto that which is below\". Above his head, as an aureole or nimbus, is 00, the mathematical sign of infinity. Since Mercury and Thoth are the Gods of Wisdom and Magick, it is plain that this card is a harmonious attribution. Mastic, Mace, and Storax are the perfumes of this twelfth Path; the Agate is its jewel; Vervain its sacred plant. The Ibis is its sacred bird, which ages ago was observed to have the curious habit of standing on one leg for long periods of time, and to the fertile imagination of the ancients this suggested the absorption in profound meditation. In Yoga practice there is a posture called the Ibis wherein the practitioner balances himself on one leg. The rituals, moreover, address Thoth as \"0 thou of the Ibis Head\". I must now refer to an important point of Hebrew grammar. The sounds of certain of the letters in the Hebrew Alphabet become changed when a dot, called the dogish, is placed within those letters. The letter B becomes changed to V, when the dot in the middle is omitted, thus ::l. It is imperative that this little detail be remembered as it assumes great importance in later research work, it being within the experience of the writer that the researches of a certain highly learned Qabalist have been hampered in a most extraordinary manner by this and similar facts having been omitted from his elementary Qabalistic training. 71 THE PATHS ~-B (Bes) Second letter of the Alphabet.

The fan as a magical weapon is attributed to Aleph, having an obvious reference to Air. Its colour is Sky Blue, its jewels Topaz and Chalcedony, and its perfume Galbanum. \"B\" is a sound of internal activity, developing within a space closed by the lips and mouth-hence, a symbolic house. Its pronunciation is Bes, translated by a \" House\". The Sepher Yetsirah states that the letter B reigns in Wisdom. Wisdom is naturally the god Hermes, and its planetary attribution follows as a consequence- ~, Mer- cury. Thoth, and his Cynocephalus, and Hanuman are included as correspondences. This Path, denominated \"The Transparent Intelligence \", partakes of both the nature of Chokmah and Hod, both of which are Mercurial. The alchemical conception of the universal Mercury was that of a flowing, shifting, and unstable principle, ever changing. This may account for the baboon or monkey ever in attendance upon Thoth, for the monkey is restless, ever moving, and never still, typifying the human Ruach, which must be quieted. The Norwegian Odin-the infinite wanderer, would possibly be attributed here for precisely this reason. He is the spirit of life who, according to the legends, does not create the world himself, but only plans and arranges it. All knowledge issues from him, and he too is the inventor of poetry and the Norse runes. Its magical weapon is the Caduceus wand, which has particular reference to the phenomenon of Kundalini arising in the course of Yoga practices, particularly Dharana and Pranayama.

In her hand is the scroll of the Law. She is, in one sense, the Shechinah, and our Lady Babalon according to another system. In the old Rosicrucian grade system, the Supernal Triad constitutes the Inner College of Masters, and is called the Order of the Silver Star. Since the Path of Gimel or the Moon links the Supernal Triad with Tipharas, serving as the means of entry to the Inner College, it will be observed that the Tarot symbols are consistent. Yet some students have allocated this card to Bes. Artemis, Hecate, Chomse, and Chandra are the deities attributed, all of them being lunar goddesses. Its colour is Silver, the glistening colour of the Moon; Camphorand Aloes are its perfumes; the Moonstone and Pearl being its jewels. The Dog is sacred to Gimel, probably because the huntress Artemis always had hounds in attendance. The Bow and Arrow, for the same reason, is its symbolic magical instrument. When the dogish is omitted, the Gimel has a soft sound, similar to the English J. '1-D (Dallas) Fourth letter of Alphabet. Path No. Fourteen, joining Chokmah to Binah, Numerical value, 4. Since this Path joins, in the region of the Supernals, the Father to the Mother, we would logically anticipate eorres- pondences expressing the attraction of the positive for the negative, and the love of the male for the female whereby the Yod and the Heh primal unite. Its astrological attribu- tion is ~, Venus, the Lady of Love. The pronunciation of this letter as Dallas means a \"Door \", which even in Freudian symbolism possesses the significance of the womb. TIle colours are Green and Emerald Green. The jewels are the Emerald and Turquoise; the flowers Myrtle and Rose; the birds being the Sparrow and Dove. The magical appurtenance is the Girdle, in view of the legend that whosoever wore Aphrodite's girdle became an object of universal love and desire. The title of this fourteenth Path is \"The Luminous Intelligence\", and its gods are Aphrodite, Lalita-the sexual aspect of Sakti, the wife of Shiva-and the sweet low-brewed Hathor, who is a cow-goddess. To attempt to illustrate once more the implication of the idea of a God, I quote an apt remark, which should be borne in mind and applied throughout, from the Notes on the Hippolytus of Euripides, by Gilbert Murray: \" The Aphrodite of Euripides' actual belief, if one may venture to dogmatize on such a subject, was almost cer- tainly not what we should call a goddess, but rather a force of Nature, or a Spirit working in the world. To deny her existence you would have to say not merely: 'There is no such person ',. but ' there is no such thing'; and such a denial would be a defiance of obvious facts.\" The Goddess of Love in the Norse myths was Freyja, the daughter of Njord-a Jupiterian tutelary deity. The Tarot card is IlL-The Empress, who bears in her right hand a sceptre, being a globe surmounting a cross, the astrological sigil of Venus,~. Her robe repeats this symbol, and at the side, of her throne is a \"heart-shaped shield bearing also the sign of Venus.

Its Yetsiratic title is \" The Constituting Intelligence\", and its astrological attribution is cr Aries, the sign of the Ram, ruled by t Mars, and in which the 0 Sun is exalted. Its attributions are, hence, fiery and martial. Its Gods are Athena, insofar as she protected the State from its enemies; and Shiva and Mars. Minerva is also an attribution, for she was believed to have guided men in war, where victory was to be gained by prudence, courage, and perseverance. The Egyptian Mentu is also a god of War, depicted with the head of a Hawk. The Scandinavian Tyr is an attribution to this Path, for he is the most daring and intrepid of the Gods, and it is he who dispenses valour, courage, and honour in the Wars. The Spear is the weapon appropriate; the flower Ger- anium, and the jewel Ruby because of its colour. The Tarot card is IV.-entitled The Emperor, who has a red robe, and seated on a throne (in his crown are rubies), his legs forming a cross. His arms and head form a triangle. We have, therefore, ~, the alchemical symbol of Sulphur, a fiery energetic principle, the Hindu Gunam of Rajas, the quality of energy and volition. On the arms of his throne are carved two ram's heads, showing that this attribution is harmonious. l-V (Vav) Sixth letter of Alphabet. Path No. Sixteen on Tree, joining Chokmah to Ohesed, Numerical value, 6. Vav is its pronunciation, and means a \"Nail\". It is used as a symbol of the phallus. This usage is confirmed by the Zodiacal sign of ~ The Bull, which, as already pointed out, is a glyph of the universal reproductive force. The phallus, in the mysticism of the Qabalah, is a creative symbol of a creative reality, the magical will. As an aid to the comprehension of this idea I quote from Jung's Psych- ology of the Unconscious for a definition: \"The phallus is a being which moves without limbs, which sees without eyes, which knows the future; and as symbolic representative of the universal creative power existent everywhere immortality is vindicated in it. • . . It is a seer, an artist, and a worker of miracles.\" This definition is particularly appropriate to the Chiah, of which the lingam is the terrestrial symbol as well as vehicle. The attributions follow the astrological one very closely, for we find here the Egyptian Asar Ameshet Apis, the fighting bull of Memphis, who trampled on his enemies. The Orphic congregations at certain of their holiest secret convocations solemnly partook of the blood of a bull, according to Murray, which bull was, by some mystery, the blood of Dionysius-Zagreus himself, the\" Bull of God\" slain in sacrifice for the purification of man. And the Mrenads of poetry and mythology, among more beautiful proofs of their superhuman character, have always to tear bulls in pieces and taste of the blood. The reader will also recall to mind the fair promise of Lord Dunsany's most interesting story, The Blessing of Pan.

He is represented as raising his right hand in the sign of benedic- tion over the heads of two ministers, and in his left hand he bears a wand or sacerdotal staff surmounted by a triple cross. At his feet are two keys, those of Life and Death, which solve the mysteries of existence. . Vav is also the\" Son\" of Tetragrammaton-Bacchus or Christ in Olympus (Heaven) saving the world.

In astrology it is the sign of n Gemini, the Twins. All twin gods are therefore attributed to this Path. Rekht and Merti of the Hindus, and Castor and Pollux of the Greeks. Apollo also is a correspondence, but only in that aspect of him as the Diviner, having the power to communi- cate the gift of prophecy to both gods and men. Nietzsche, in his Birth of Tragedy, says of Apollo that not only is he a god of all shaping energies, but also the soothsaying god. THE PATHS 77 ..

The higher truth, the perfection of these states in contrast to the only p~rtially intelligible everyday world,ay, the deep con- sciousness of nature, healing and helping in sleep and dream, is at the same time the symbolical analogue of the faculty of soothsaying and, in general of all the arts, through which life is made possible and worth living.\" Janus is an attribution, since he is represented with two faces, each looking in a different direction. Hoo-paar- Kraat is .an attribution again, principally because he sums up the two twin Gods of Horus, the Lord of Strength, and Harpocrates, the Lord of Silence, in one deific personality. Zayin is called in the Sepher Yetsirah .. The Disposing Intelligence\". All hybrids are attributed here; its bird is the Magpie, and Alcxandrite and Tourmaline its precious stones. Its colour is Mauve, and its plants are all forms and species of Orchids. The Tarot card is VI.-The Lovers. Ancient packs describe this as representing a man between two women, who arc Vice and Virtue, Lilith, the wife of the evil Samael, and Eve.

The Tarot card is a most interesting one, VIl.-The Chariot. It denotes a chariot, the canopy of which is blue and decked with stars (representing Nuit, the night sky- blue, Space, and our Lady of the Stars). In the chariot is a crowned and armoured figure, on whose forehead glitters a Silver Star-the symbol of spiritual rebirth. On his shoulders are mounted two crescents, the waxing and wan- ing Moon. Drawing the chariot are two sphinxes, one white, the other black, representing the conflicting forces in his being which he has mastered. On the front of the chariot is a glyph of the lingam, his regenerated or sub- limated \" Id \" or libido, surmounted by the winged globe, his transcendental Ego with whom he has become united. The whole card adequately symbolizes the Great Work, that process by which a man comes to know the unknown Crown, and attains to the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel, perfect self-integration and con- sciousness. A word apropos the libido. In this term Jung saw a concept of an unknown nature, comparable to Henri Bergson's elan vital, a hypothetical energy of life, which occupies itself not alone in sexuality but in various other physiological spiritual manifestations. Bergson speaks of this elan vital as a movement of self-creation, a becoming, and as the very stuff and reality of our being. Its sacred animal is the Sphinx, whose expression of enigma combining male, female, and animal qualities is an apt symbolofthe Great Work brought to perfection.

On the top of the circumference is a Sphinx bearing a sword. The wheel represents the ever- whirling Karmic cycle of Samsara, of existence after existence, at one moment elevating us above princes and the kings of the land, and at others throwing us below the level of slaves and the dust of the earth. On the wheel, at each of the cardinal points, are inscribed the letters TARO, and in between them the four Hebrew letters of Tetragram- maton.

Its Egyptian God bears out the idea of Justice for she is Maat, the Goddess of Truth, who in the Book of the Dead appears in the judgment scene of the weighing of the heart of the deceased. Nemesis, too, is a correspon- dence, as she measured out to mortals happiness and misery; and here, too, is the Hindu concept of Yama, the personification of death and Hell where men had to expiate their evil deeds. The plant of Lamed is Aloe; its animals the Spider and Elephant; its perfume is Galbanum, and its colour Blue. Its Yetsiratic title is \" The Faithful Intelligence\". l~-M (Mem.) Thirteenth letter.

In its shape, some authorities perceive the waves of the sea. Its gods are Tum Ptah Auromoth, combining the idea of the God of the Setting Sun, the King of the Gods, and a purely elemental divinity. Poseidon and Neptune are again attributed as representing water and the seas. Mem is called\" The Stable Intelligence\", and its colour is Sea Green.

The correspondences again appear to follow the astrolo- gical interpretation, which is 111 Scorpio, the reptile fabled to sting itself to death. cJ Mars rules Scorpio, and its Greek God is, therefore, Mars; its Roman God Ares. Apep, the Egyptian God, an immense serpent, is attributed here. Kundalini is the Hindu Goddess representing the creative force (libido), coiled up as a serpent at the base of the spine, 'in the so-called lotus of the Muladhara Chakra. Its magical formula is Regeneration through Putrefac- tion. The alchemists of old used this formula mainly. The first common matter of their operations was base, and had to pass through several stages of corruptions or putrefac- tion (or chemical change, as it would be styled to-day), when it was called the black dragon-but from this putrid stage, the pure gold was derived. Another application of the same formula applies to that psychological state of which all mystics speak, viz.: the Spiritual Dryness or \"The Dark Night of the Soul\", wherein all one's powers are held temporarily in abeyance gathering, in reality, strength to shoot up and blossom forth in the light of the Spiritual Sun. Its sacred animal is, therefore, the Beetle, representing the Egyptian God Khephra, the Beetle-God of the Midnight Sun symbolizing Light in Darkness.

Astrologically, it is li Capricornus, the mountain goat leaping forwards and up- wards, boldly without fear, yet remaining close to the hill- tops. Its symbols,again, are both the Yoni and the Lingam, and its gods are emblematic of the creative forces of Nature. Khem is the Egyptian creative principle, almost always shown with the head of a lustful goat. Priapus is the Greek God, insofar as he was the God of sexual fecundity and fruitfulness. Pan, when represented as the goat of the flock\" raving and raping, ripping and rending everlast- ing \", is attributed here, too. Bacchus, the jovial representative of the reproductive and intoxicating power of Nature, is another correspondence. Hemp, from which Hashish is a derivative, is attributed because of its intoxicating and ecstasy-producing qualities. Ayin represents the spiritual creative force of God- head, which, should it become openly manifest in a man, makes of him JEgipan, the All. This Path is symbolical of the Man-god, eager and exalted, consciously aware of his True Will and ready to set out on his long and wearisome journey of redeeming the world. The Tarot card is XV.-The Devil, showing a winged goat-headed satyr, with a pentagram on his brow, pointing upwards with his right hand, and his left hand clutching a flaming firebrand pointing downwards. To his throne are chained a nude male and female figure, both having the horns of a goat. c-s (Samech) Fifteenth letter. Path No. Twenty-five, joining Tipharas and Yesod. Numerical value, 60. This letter means a \" Prop\". The Path is attributed to the zodiacal sign of Sagittarius :t the Arrow, and is called \"The Tentative Intelligence\". Sagittarius is essentially a hunting sign and Diana, as the celestial Archer and the Goddess of the Chase, finds her place in this category. Apollo and Artemis as Hunters with the bow and arrow are also included. The symbol of Sagittarius is the Centaur, half-man and half-beast, who is traditionally connected with Archery; and the Horse, too, is a correspondence of Sameeh. The plant appropriate is the Rush, used for making arrows; perfume Lignaloes, and Green is the colour. The Rainbow is also a correspondence of Samech, and in this connection the God Ares is attributed. The Tarot attribution is XIV.-Temperance, showing an anzel crowned with the golden sigil of the Sun, clothed in beautiful white robes, and on his breast are written the letters of the Tetragrammaton over a white square, wherein is a gold triangle. He pours a blue liquid from a gilt chalice into another. This Path leads from Yesod to Tipharas, the sphere of 0 the Sun. The Angel of the Tarot, would typify the Holy Guardian Angel to whom man aspires. The keynote of the astrological sign, the arrow pointing heavenwards, is Aspiration, and the sigil of the Sun and the gilt triangle over the heart of the Angel, all point to the object of aspiration, representing Asar-Un-Nefer, man made perfect. 84 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES horse (reminding us of one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse) armed with a scythe mowing down all and everything with which he comes into contact.

It is the third of the Reciprocal Paths. Its Y etsiratic title is \" The Natural Intelligence\". ' Its astrological attribution is J Mars, and therefore this Path repeats to a large extent the attributions of the sphere of Geburah, although on a less spiritual plane. Horus, the hawk-headed Lord of Strength, Mentu, the God of War of the Egyptians; Ares and Mars of the Greeks and Romans, and all other warrior gods, are the deity attributions. Krishna, as the charioteer to the Kurukshetra battle, is the Hindu correspondence. Odin, too, was portrayed in the Norse myths as a War god, and sent the, Valkyries to welcome the fallen heroes to the festive boards of Valhalla. Anderson in his Norse Mythology says that the Valkyries \" are the handmaidens of Odin, and the God of War sends his thoughts and his will to the carnage of the battlefield in the form of mighty armed women, in the same manner as he sends his ravens all over the earth \". Its metal is Iron, its animals the Bear and Wolf, its jewels the Ruby and any other red stone; its plants Rue, Pepper, and Absinthe; its perfumes Pepper and all pungent odours, and its colour Red. The Tarot card appropriate is XVI.-The Tower, the upper part of which is shaped like a crown. It is alternately THE PATHS 87 called The House of God, and its subsidiary title is \" The Lord of the Hosts of the Mighty\". The card illustrates the Tower being struck by a vivid zig-zag flash of lightning which has demolished the top, and red tongues of flame lick the three windows from which two figures have jumped. This letter has, with the letter Caph, particular reference to a magical formula which is admirably suited to the grade of Adeptus Major.

This idea con\" tinues in the Tarot card, which is XVII.-The Star, depict- -ing a nude female kneeling by a body of water, pouring water from two jugs, held one in each hand. Above her are seven eight-pointed stars surrounding a larger Star. The subsidiary title is \" The Daughter of the Firmament. The Dweller between the Waters\". This Path is distinctly feminine, joining ~ Venus to \"=' Moon, both feminine influences; and Juno, the Greek goddess who watches over the female sex and was regarded as the Genius of womanhood, is its main attribution. Athena as the patroness of both useful and elegant arts (the arts are the astrological characteristics of the native of Aquarius) is a correspondence; as is Ganymede, also, because of his almost feminine beauty and because he was the. Cup-bearer. Ahepi and Aroueris are the Egyptian equivalents. The plant of Tsaddi is the Olive, which Athena is believed to have created for mankind; its animal the Eagle, which is said to have carried Ganymede away to Olympus; its perfume Galbanum, and its colour Sky Blue.

Its Yetsiratic title is \" The Corporeal Intelligence\"; and its attribution is * Pisces, the Sign of the Fishes. This Path is a very difficult one to describe, as it un- doubtedly refers to some aspect of the Astral Plane; and it is, also, a phallic symbol, the fish referring to the spermatozoa swimming in the foundations of one's being. Its Hindu attribution is Vishnu as the Matsu or Fish A vatara. Neptune and Poseidon, insofar as their realm of govern- ment includes the dominion wherein fish dwell; and Khephra, as the beetle or crab, are other correspondences. All these symbols conceal, or relate to, a species of Magick which is allied to the application of the formula of Tetra- grammaton, Jesus of Nazareth is sometimes termed the Piscean, and readers will recall early Christian amulets upon which were inscribed the Greek word\" Ichthus,\" meaning Fish, and having reference to the personality recognized as the Son of God by the Christian Churches. The Babylonian teacher of Wisdom, Oannes, likewise was represented in phallic fish form. Its sacred creature is the Dolphin, its colour Buff, and its jewel the Pearl. The Pearl is referred to Pisces be- cause of its cloudy brilliance as contrasted with the trans- parency of other jewels, thus reminding one somewhat of the astral plane with its cloudy forms and semi-opaque visions as opposed to the flashes of formless light apper- taining to purely spiritual planes. XVlII.-The :Moon, is its Tarot card, describing a mid- night landscape on which the moon is shining.

Path No. Thirty, joining Hod to Yesod. Numerical value, 200. Resh is its pronunciation and means a Head. The Sun is attributed to this Path, and all the symbols are clearly solar. Ra, Helios, Apollo, and Surya are all gods of the solar disk. Yellow is the colour given to Resh; Cinnamon and Olibanum are its perfumes-obviously solar; the Lion and the Sparrowhawk are its animals. Gold is the appropriate metal; the Sunflower, Heliotrope, and Laurel being its plants. Crysoleth is its jewel, suggesting the golden colour of the Sun. Its title is \" The Collecting Intelligence\". The Tarot card XIX.-The Sun, corresponds beautifully. It seems extraordinarily difficult to believe that some writers on the Qabalah attribute this card to the letter Qoph. The card depicts a blazing sun above the Crowned and Conquering Child Horus, who rides triumphantly on a White Horse-the symbol of the Kalki A vatara. In the background of the card are several sunflowers, which again point to the solar nature of the allocation. The Sepher Yetsirah denominates\" Resh,\" a \"double letter \", but I have been unable to discover any sound other than \" R \" for this letter; nor is any other so recognized by modern Hebrew grammarians. Perhaps the French form of \"R\" -pronounced with a decided roll-is the sound in question. Twenty-first letter. Path No. Thirty-one, joining Hod to Malkus. Numerical value, 300.

The. implication of this Path is that of the Holy Spirit descending in tongues of fire-reminding one of the Apostles of Christ at Pentecost-and all its attributions are fiery. Agni is the Hindu God of Tejas, the tattva or element of fire. Hades is the Greek god of the fiery nether regions, as also are Vulcan and Pluto. Its Egyptian gods denote fiery elemental divinities, Thoum-sesh-neith, Kabeshunt, and Tarpesheth. Its plants are the Red Poppy and Hibiscus. Knowing the above attributions one well understands and feels the plaintive cry of the poet: \"Crown me with poppy and hibiscus\". The jewel of this Path is the fire Opal, and its perfumes Olibanum and all fiery odours. The Sepher Yetsirah title is \" The Perpetual Intelligence\".

Saturn as the great astrological malefic, and (b) the universe in toto, represented by Brahma and Panas the sum total of all existent in- telligences. In the lattcr category is Gaea or Ge, the personification of the earth. There is also the Norse Vidar, whose name indicates that hc is the imperishable nature of the world, likened to the immensity of the indestructible forests, and like the Greek Pan he is the representative of the silent, secret, and peaceful groves. Anderson, again, implies that Vidar is the eternal, wild, original nature, the god of imperishable matter. Saturn, an early Italian god, is an earth deity too, he having taught the people agri- culture, suppressed their savagery, and introduced them to civilization. In connection with (a), however, we have Sebek, the crocodile god, signifying the grossest form of matter, and such correspondences as Assafoetida and all evil odours, and the Hindu Tamo-gunam, the quality of slothfulness and inertia. Its colour is Black, its plants the Ash and Nightshade, and its Yetsiratic title\" The Administrative Intelligence\". The Tarot card is XXI.-The World, showing within a flowery wreath a female figure, who has come to be known as the Virgin of the World, giving this Path added significance since it descends upon Malleus, to which the Zohar allocates the final Heh, the Daughter, who is the reflection below of the Shechinah on high.

But the idea of an inner man using a mind and body as instruments for the obtaining of experience and thus self-consciousness is inherent in every mystical system that has seen the light of the Sun. The classifications of the nature of man used by the various schools of Mysticism are tabulated on the opposite chart, using the ten Sephiros as the basis for comparison. In their analysis of man, the Qabalists found that hand in hand with the physical body man had an automatic- or habit-forming or desire-consciousness, whichgave him im- petus and volition in certain directions. It took care of the functions of his organism to which conscious attention was seldom directed, such as the circulation of the blood, the beating of the heart, and the involuntary motions of the diaphragm resulting in the inspiration and expiration of breath. They also noted the faculty of reason and criticism, the power whereby a man proceeds from premisses to con- clusion. And above and beyond this was the Spiritual entity who used this body, who used this desire and rational consciousness. It should be obvious to ordinary analysis, too, that there appear in man these three distinct \"lives\". There is, to state the preceding paragraph in a slightly different way, the life of the body, with its host of desires and instincts, and in all the wonderful working machinery of the body. This aspect of the man some Qabalists have termed the N ephesch, the animal soul-unredeemed. Then comes his personality-the Ruach, a constantly changing, restless \" I \", which we know, and in which we are conscious of our- selves. Lastly a greater consciousness, transcending all these and embracing them at the same time, is the Neschamah, the real Ego. / The Nephesdi has been partially investigated by Freud, Adler, and Jung, and apart from all theorizations, their observed facts accord with Qabalistic tradition. The Ruach has received attention from philosophers, and the Neschamah seems to have been sadly neglected. The above division is called the threefold classification of man, and is similar to the orthodox Christian conception of Body, Soul, and Spirit, In this connection, there is, I might add, yet another principle postulated by the Qabalah. The N eschamali of this classification would correspond with the Hindu conception of Jivatma, the soul or self-con- ditioned. To the conception, in the same philosophy, of Paramatma-the Supreme Self, there is a parallel in Zoharic text called the Zureh, a celestial, spiritual, perfect prototype which never leaves its abode in the Olam Atsilus (q.v., Chapter Seven). The Zoharists conceive of Zureh. as connected in some way with the Neechamah by spiritual and magnetic ties. . Isaac Myers has a few very interesting remarks to make in this respect. He says that by devotion the magical will elevates the N eschamali to its Zureh, where they unite. \"The higher prototypic soul becomes stirred up and, by a mystic influence, they are chained to each other.\" This idea falls within the Mystic- ism of the Qabalah, where the doctrine of ecstasy plays a prominent part, and belongs therefore to a later chapter. The Qabalists have another way of looking at the con- stitution of man-this time from a more practical point of view. It is based upon what is called the formula of Tetra- grammaton, or the attributing of the four letters of YHVH mn' to various parts of man. The first Sephirah, Keser-the Crown, is not included generally in this particular method; or when it is, is simply called God, or the goal of life to which a man aspires for union. Y' is given to Chokmah, and is called the Father. In the Indian systems, this would correspond to Atma, the Self. The Mother is Binah, the Celestial Shechinah, and the first Heh rt fs her letter Thr Causa) Sheath would be the .Yoga equivalent. Next IS the Son, who is in Tipharas, but in reality the hexagonal aggregate of six Sephiros having its basis or centre in Tipharas. The letter of the Son is V , -the general conception ..corresponding to the Sukshmo- padhi, or the Subtle body. Now Malkus, the Kingdom, is called the Unredeemed Virgin, and is N ephesch, the Animal Soul of man, or the Sthulopadhi. She is the final Heh rt. The Son is the Augceides, the Self-glittering One, the Spiritual Soul of Man. He is also, according to another system, the Holy Guardian Angel; and the object of this"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"96 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES particular classification is that the unredeemed Virgin, Nephesch, must marry the celestial bridegroom, the Son of the All-Father, who is in Tipharas. This process is called the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. It is the alchemical marriage, the mystical nuptials of the heavenly Bride and Groom. This union makes the Virgin a pregnant Mother (Aimah, who is Binah), and with her the Father eventually unites himself- and both, thereby, become absorbed into the Crown. This apparent obscurity can be clarified considerably. The final He is the Nephesdi or subconsciousness. Normally, one's conscious mind, the Vav or Son, is in dire conflict with the subconscious self, and confusion and a disruption of one's total consciousness is the result. One's first object must be to reconcile the conscious ego with the subconscious mind, and set the factor of equilibrium between the two. (This idea is splendidly elaborated by Jung in his commen- tary to R. Wilhelm's The Secret of the Golden Flower.) When this usual source of conflict has disappeared (or, as this old symbolism says, when the Vav and He final have married) one is in a position to obtain Understanding, which is Binah, the first He, and the Mother. From Understanding, which is Love, Wisdom can arise. Wisdom is Y the Father, Chokmah. With the union in oneself of Wisdom and Understanding, the purpose of life may be divined, and the goal envisaged at the end thereof, and the steps leading to the consummation of Divine Union may be instituted with- out danger, fear, or the ordinary conflicts of the personality. I may add, merely in passing, that a highly puissant formula of magick derives from this classification. There is another classification, a little more philosophical, which is preferred by many. It is essentially derived from The Commentary on the Ten Sephiros, written in Hebrew by Rabbi Azariel ben Menaham already mentioned. He dis- tinguished himself as a philosopher, Qabalist and Tal- mudist, and was a pupil of Isaac the Blind, the founder of the Qabalistic School of Gerena. His commentary, men- tioned above, is written in a remarkably lucid and academic manner, and the classification is extremely satisfactory. His classification made of Man an entity having six ADAM KADMON 97 differ:nt aspec.ts. .It must not crudely be supposed that Rabbi Azariel impliad that these six divisions of man could ~e c~t .uP separately and anyone of them put aside. The SIX dI:lSlons are only aspects of one entity, whose nature is consc~ousness. Man as a whole, comprising his various functIOIl;s and ~owers and Sephiros, is an integral Unity. Ra: bbi Azanel characterized the Supernal Triad of Sephiros the Immortal Man, so called. Keseris the Monad the u~extended and indivisible centre of spiritual force and consciousness-i-the Yechidah, which is translated by the :' Only One \", the\" Unique One \", or the Real Self which IS the Undying Spiritual Pilgrim who incarnates from time to ~ime \"to take his pleasure among the living\".

In .the descent towards manifestation and matter, the Yechidah adds to itself a Creative vehicle of an Ideal na.t~re, Chiah, which is the Will or creative impulse of the orIglI~al Poi~t~of- View. Its Theosophical title is Buddhi, the direct spiritual vehicle of Atma.

The third aspect of the immortal entity is N eschamah, or Intuition, the faculty for the Understanding of the Will of the Monad. In Theosophy, this is Higher or Buddhi- Manas, which, together with Atma-Buddhi, is the god of a high and noble rank, who incarnates in the brute forms of the early races of mankind in order to endow them with mind. The Manasaputras have both Solar and Mercurial connections. The Vedantists call this principle the Vijnana- mayakosa, the Sheath of Knowledge; and its correspond- ing Chakra in the Yogas is the Visuddhi, said to be located in the subtle body on the spine at a point opposite to the larynx. This trinity of the original spiritual Monad, its Creative vehicle, and Intuition, form a synthetic integral Unity which philosophically may be denominated the Transcen- dental Ego. It is a Unity in a unique manner, and its attributes are summed up in the three Hindu hypostases, more true, perhaps, of the Sephiros than the parts of man, of Sat, Chit, Ananda; Absolute Being, Wisdom, and Bliss. \" Below\" the real man exists that part of him which is perishable-the so-called lower self. \"Below\" and \" lower\" are used obviously in a metaphysical sense, and the reader must not imagine that the parts of man enumer- ated here are superimposed one upon the other like, for example, the layers of an onion. They all interpenetrate one another, and occupy the same position so far as external space is concerned. The Blavatskian aphorism concerning the four worlds holds perfectly good here; these various principles are in coadunition but not in consubstantiality. The upper Sephiros may be considered as real and ideal, and the seven lower ones as actual, and the gap between the mental conception of ideal and actual may be said to correspond to the Abyss wherein all things exist in poten- tiality-but without meaning in themselves. The Abyss is the source of all impressions, and the storehouse, so to speak, of phenomena. 98 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES /8\", , 8~---~~-----------~~~~'8 e I I I I I I I e Diagram No.8 THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN ADAM KADMON 99"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Diagram No.9 THE FACULTIES OF THE RUACH 101 ADAM KADMON characteristics of the N 'ephesch, denominating it the Sukshmopadhi or subtle body. Its astral chakra is the Anahata, which exists in or near the physical heart. The Ruach comprises the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth Sephiros, whose attributions are respectively Memory, Will, Imagination, Desire, and Reason. Memory is the very stuff of consciousness itself. It is, to use a figure of speech, the mortar of the architecture of the mind, that integrating faculty binding together all the various sensations and impressions. The Will is a colour- less principle moved by, and comparable to, desire. It is the power of the spiritual Self in action. In ordinary life it is not, as it should be, the servant of the man, but rules him with a rod of iron binding him to those very things from which he essays to escape. Imagination is a faculty much misunderstood, most people thinking of it as sheer fantasy used in day-dreaming. In reality, however, it is the king faculty, for with the Will it is the all-important principle used in operations of Magick or the Practical Qabalah. - Emotion, or the Theosophical principle of Kama (the \" Id .. of Sigmund Freud), is that element of desire or emo- tion which can either be dominated entirely by Nephesch or controlled by N eschamah, We have already considered the reasoning faculty of the Ruach in an earlier chapter-\" The Pit\". In his Ocean of Theosophy, William Quan Judge, one of the early founders of the Theosophical Society, and a co-worker of Madame liJlavatsky, wrote that reason and the cold logical faculty is Hut the lowest aspect of Manas. And this is obvious through reference to the Tree of Life. Reason is the eighth Sephirah only. The higher parts of the Ruach are an Imagination, which when spiritualized together with Will become those two faculties of the greatest importance so far as Magick is concerned, as said above. But they are still Ruach. Their spiritual equivalents are Chokmah and Binah, Wisdom and Understanding; or Chiah and Neschamah, the True Creative Self and the Intuitional Self.

Both Hume and Kant demonstrated its inherent self-con- tradictory nature, but the former did not apprehend a permanent integrating principle running through impres- sions. He therefore argued-with his Buach, which is in- competent to argue on such a point, since its nature is self- contradictory-that the Soul, not being an impression or a sensation, nor an entity to which one can point holding it there for analysis when introspecting, did not exist, for- getting all the time, or unaware perhaps of the fact, that it is the Soul, or as the Qabalists would say, the Real Man above the Abyss, who is introspecting and examining the contents of its own Buach, The Ruach is the false or empirical ego. It is that part of us which names itself\" I \", and it is just that principle which is not\" I \". Its moods change with the passing of the years. More, its contents are never the same from one minute to another. The destruction of the glamorous bondage which the Ruach exerts over us, thus permitting the light of the Nescharnah and the higher principles to shine through to illumine our minds and our daily lives, is one of the all-important tasks of Mysticism. In fact, the abnegation of this false ego (bitol hoyesh) is the essential accomplishment of all spiritual development. Some Qabalists postulate a Sephirah named Diiath, or Knowledge, as being the child of Binah and Chokmah, or a sublimation of the Ruach, supposed to appear in the Abyss in the course of man's evolution as an evolved faculty. It is a false Sephirah, however, and the Sepher Yetsirah, in anticipation, most emphatically warns us that\" Ten are the ineffable Sephiros. Ten and not nine. Ten and not eleven. Understand with Wisdom, and apprehend with care\". It is a non-existent Sephirah because, for one thing, Know- ledge when examined contains within itself-as the progeny of Ruach-the same element of self-contradiction, and being situate in the Abyss, dispersion and so of self-destruction. ADAM KADMON 108 It is false, because as soon as knowledge is critically and logically analysed, it breaks up into the dust and sand of the Abyss. The unity of the various faculties just mentioned, how- ever, comprises the Ruach which is called the Human Soul. The next principle is the N ephesch, the gross side of the spirit,the vital element which is en rapport with Guph the body, and the mainspring of all the instincts and cravings of the physical life, It is the animal side of the soul, that element of it which comes most of all into contact with the material forces of the external actual universe. Nephesch, in reality, is a dual principle, its two aspects consisting of (a) what is called by the Hindus Prana, the electrical, dynamic, and vivifying element which is life; and (b) the Astral body (tselern). They are considered together in the Qabalah under the title of N ephesch, because the action of prana is unknown and impossible without the medium of the astral body. There is a Zoharic section dealing with the garments with which the Soul or the In- corpo,real is clothed, and it speaks of the astral body in very peculiar terms: \" One outside garment which exists and does not exist. , , IS seen and not seen. In that garment, the Nephesch is clothed and she goes and flies in it, to and fro in the world.\" In another place there are unmistakable postulates of the astral body: \" In the Book of King Solomon is to be found: That at the time of the accomplishment of the union below, the H)oly One, Blessed be He, sends a deyooknah, a phantom or shadow image, like the likeness of a man. It is designed in the Divine Image (tselern) .•• and in that tselem the child of man is created . • . in this tselem he develops, as he grows, and it is with this tselem, again, that he departs from this life.\" The postulate of the Astral body grows out of the 'con- sideration that in the physical .body we find a \"some- thing\" besides matter; something changing, it is true, but undoubtedly one and the same thing from birth to death.

It is never the same from one moment to another, and within a period of seven years it has a completely new set of particles. But despite this constant throwing off of atoms, ete., there is something persisting from birth to death, changing its aspect a little, but remaining the same, giving the body a more or less con- sistent appearance during its life. This astral double or Body of Light, as it is also called, is composed of matter in an altogether different state from the physical body, being subtile, magnetic, and electric. The N ephesch forms a link between the body and the Ruach, and if we try to picture in our own minds the image of a man from birth to death, the image incorporating all the traits and peculiarities of childhood, maturity, and senility, all extended in time, that concept will convey the idea of an astral body, or the Pranamayakosa of the Vedanta. The principle of Guph, the physical body, is attributed to Malkus, the Kingdom, the sphere of the four elements, and is too well known to demand comment or description. I need only add that the predominate influence of the soul over the body, the body as being interpenetrated and over- flown in all its parts by the Real Man, and dependent upon it for the source of its life, are the implications of the Zoharic ideas of the soul. The Sepher Yetsirah makes an elaborate set of attributions to the Tree bringing in the various physical functions of man, but these are not of great importance for our present purpose. I have refrained from here discussing the various prob- lems and doctrines of the so-called Doctrinal Qabalah, such as the Evolution of the Universe and of Man, Reincarna- tion, and Causation as applied to Retribution-because, having originally postulated the incapacity of the Ruach to deal adequately with such problems, it would be useless to engage upon an exposition of these points. Particularly is this so with regard to the Zoharic and post-Zoharic con- ceptions of Gilgolem, Reincarnation. A great deal of loose thinking and unwarranted assumption characterizes the Qabalistic literature concerning this aspect of esoteric doe- trine, and I feel more strongly than ever that it is only by means of a profound and well-assimilated knowledge of 105 comparative philosophies and esoteric teaching that one is able to obtain any meaning or intellectual satisfaction from fo~ exam~le, Rabbi Isaac Luria's Gilgolem. In any event: this doctrine, and the several others above mentioned can only be solved and understood by one who has come to an Understanding. of his True Will, knowing himself to be an Immortal E?tlt~, a Star pursuing its way unhampered through the infinite heavens from eternity to eternity-not ~er:lr in a rational way, but as a result of the esh hoRuach, intuitional and spiritual experience."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX THE LITERAL QABALAH I N the previous three chapters, giving a brief descrip- tion of the philosophical Alphabet employed by Qabalists, a series of correspondences embodying a comparison of extremely dissimilar topics has been sys- tematically placed under the category of each letter of that Alphabet, rendering study and memorization more simple than otherwise might be the case. It is essential to again emphasize the fact that unless these attributions are com- mitted to memory, at least partially, and a number of new correspondences added from the separate store of know- ledge at the disposal of each student, very little benefit will be derived. The Tree must be made to grow in one's own mind so that, although its roots are firmly implanted in the earth of one's body, its uppermost branches soar high and sway gently, wafted to and fro by faint zephyr-like breezes of the spiritual realms. A few methods of applying Qabalistic ideas will now be demonstrated, the reader bearing firmly in mind that each letter has a number, symbol, and Tarot card attributed to it. The Rabbis who originally worked on the Qabalah discovered so much of interest and importance behind the merely superficial value of numbers and of words embody- ing and representing these numbers, that they gradually developed an elaborate science of numerical conceptions altogether apart from mathematics as such. They devised various methods of number interpretation to discover, primarily, the hinden meaning of their scriptures. GEMATRIA The first method is called Gematria, derived from a Greek root implying the sense of numbers represented by letters. Gematria, therefore, is the art of discovering the 106 THE LITERAL QABALAH 107 secret sense of a word by means of the numerical equivalents of each letter. Its method of procedure depends on the fact that each Hebrew letter has a definite numerical value and may actually be used in place of a number. When the total o~ the numbers of the letters of anyone word were identical with that of another word, no matter how different its meaning and translation, a close correspondence and analogy was seen. For example, the word t:tm Nachosch, a \"Serpent \", adds. to 358: tv 800 + n 8 + ::l 50 = 358. Also n'tv~ Messiah adds to 358! n 8 + \" 10 + tv 300 + ~ 40 = 858. . A certain relation might theoretically be said to exist, but the problem is, how is this relation to be discovered? Th~ Serpent. is a symbol of the Kundalini, the spiritual creative. force I.n each man which, when aroused by means o~ a trained will, re-creates the entire individual, making him a God-Man. Thus, the Initiates of Ancient India called thems~lves Nagas or Serpents, and thus, also, the Serpent WorshIp (far more than mere Phallicism) in all countries of all ages which ever has been the problem to archreologists. The word Naga, too, or Naja is discovered, so I am informed, on some of the c~~eiform tablets in the ancient Temples of Egypt where. OSIrI~, the Sun-God was hailed when arising ~r?~ ~he primordial deep. The Neophyte, during his 111ltIatIon, w~en he was Osirified and plunged into a deep trance endurmg for three days, was crowned with glory when the sun's rays would illumine the cross to which he had been .secured, and given a head-dress marked bya Uneus Naja, an emblem of cosmic significance and spiritual knowledge. Moreover, if we add up the digits, 3, 5, 8, we obtain 16. If we look up the correspondences of the sixteenth Path several attributions may be found there which may tend t~ e?ification. It is the\" Son\" of Tetragrammaton-Diony- sIUs-Za~reus; and Parsifal who has become the Hierophant or Messiah, able to solve the mysteries of existence and performing the miracle of redemption. ' We thus see the specific analogy between the words \" Serpent \" and \"Messiah \" which the Qabalah has been able to reveal. When dealing with the Path of Shin, it was there stated"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"108 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES that the general implication of that Path was that of the descent of the Holy Spirit. Apart from all the other information furnished, how may we confirm such a conclusion ? The Hebrew words O'il?H rrn Ruach Elohim may be translated \" The Spirit of the Gods \". By Gematria, its numerical value is ascertained to be 300. The numerical value of the letter Shin was also said to be 300, and we see, therefore, that they are identical. There is another method of applying the processes of Gematria along slightly different lines. In her Secret Doctrine Blavatsky writes that Fohat is the vitalizing electric principle animating and propelling the cosmos, magnetism and electricity being its purely terrestrial pheno- mena. Comparison of description and explanation yields the fact that Fohat is very similar in function and quality to Sakti, already referred to Binah, our third Sephirah. But there is another way of arriving at this attribution, even if we were unable to find a description of some known quality already placed on our Tree with which to compare it. When transliterated into Hebrew, Fohat would be spelt : b~~j1::~. The Gematria of this would be c 80 + 37 70 +:-t 5 + H 1 + b 9 = 165. The Hebrew word t:'~'n Chazokim, which means Strength or Energy, also has the numerical value of 165. c 40 + .. 10 + i' 100 + , 7 +n 8=165. A connection is thus traced between Fohat and the idea of Strength or Energy, and from this alone we could assume that Fohat was martial in character. We can continue yet further in our application of the details of our philosophical alphabet. 1 +6 +5 =12. 1 +2 equals 3, which is the number of Binah, to which Sakti, as we have seen, was attributed. Still another method of spelling Fohat is bHj1!J. Its value is c 80 + i1 5 + H 1 + e 9 =95, which is the number of a Hebrew word t:'1;j1 IIaMayim, meaning the Waters. The Great Sea has previously been mentioned as one of the correspondences of Binah, and Binah is not only Shechinah, the Holy Spirit, but Sakti. By adding the digits 9 and 5, we obtain 14. The Hebrew THE LITERAL QABALAH 109 word \", Dad equals , 4 +, 6 +, 4 =14. Its meaning is Love, which is of course harmonious with the Great Mother, an~ we could assume it as part of the meaning of Foh~t. ,!hIS love rna! be construed as a form of magnetism manifesting as cohesion and attraction among the objects and particles of the phenomenal world. Mter having written the above, the writer referred to t~at section of The Secret Doctrine dealing with Fohat, and discovered that Blavatsky gives Eros, the young God of Love, as a correspondence of Fohat! The writer had completely forgotten this fact when investigating this word by number. Moreover, Blavatsky writes elsewhere that Fohat is in the cosmos what Kama, the principle of indivi- dual desire or passion, is in the microcosm. The symbols are seen, hence, to tally in a perfect manner. But we may continue still further. 1 plus 4 equals 5. Five is the sphere of Geburah or 6 Mars. The reader will recall that this Sephirah repeats 011 a lower plane the force- element attributed to Binah. This can be proved in another manner, by analysing each letter of the word separately. C F is 3 Mars with its ~mpli?it connotation of Strength and Brute Ene;gy. :p 0 IS Priapus, the Greek God of sexual fecundity and fruit- fulness. n H is 'Y' Aries, in which d Mars is exalted. Its Tarot attribution was the Emperor wherein was found con- cealed the symbol of Sulphur, or the Hindu Gunam of Rajas. Ii A is Thor with his Swastika, hurling thunder- bolts and lightn~ng from heaven. Aleph, top, is the whirling Force ?f the Primum Mobile, formulating cosmic dust into the spiral nebulee, b T is ~ Leo, the Lion, with its Tarot attribution of VIII-Strength. All these correspondences repeat the general meaning of strength and force, coinciding WIth Blavatsky's description of Fohat. . The above will go to show how the Qabalists proceed to discover the meaning of a word which, previously, was an unknown quantity. NOTARIQON .

Alternately, by taking separately each letter of a given word, and expanding each one into another word, a sentence can be formed. An example may be given. In Chapter One, it was remarked that the doctrine of the Qabalah, as a philoso- phical system, is denominated \" Chokmah Nistorah \", the Secret Wisdom. By taking the first letter of each of these two words we obtain jn CMn, a Hebrew word meaning \" Grace\". The implication is that the study ofthis arcane wisdom of the Qabalah endows one with the Grace or Shechinah from the Gods on high. Another way is to take the last letters, viz.: rtrr Heh, meaning a \"window\", showing that the Qabalah is that window through which one may envisage the true meaning of existence. Moreover, the former method of Gematria can be applied to the process or results of Notariqon. The numeration of Chen is rt 8 +f 50 =58, which is the numerical value of '''''iT Chili, a word meaning \"My Strength\". The Qabalistic doctrines are the strength and support of a man's inner life. Heh equals M 5 +n 5 =10. There is a word n::l:! Gevoh, translated by \"To Fly\", which also adds to 10. The reader can assemble all these meanings and results; the total giving him a conception of the real meaning of the purpose of the Secret Wisdom. The word of Power N'~~ AGI,A, so frequently em- ployed in the rituals of the Practical Qabalah, is composed of the first letters of the four words ':J1~ 0';'11\"') \"'::l;: nn~ -Atoh Gibor LeOlahm, Adonai; which we can translate \"Thou art Mighty forever, my Lord \". The Path of Caph was explained to imply the infinite priapic prodigality and fruitfulness of Nature. It was also stated to represent the Wheel of Samsaric rebirth, sweeping us headstrong into existence after existence. This idea can be amplified considerably by Notariqon. Caph is spelt in Hebrew '1::J. The first letter ::J may be made to stand for the Greek word KTfLS', and the last letter ep for q..aAAoS', implying that the coition of the sexual organs is the instrument of Nature's rash prodigality, which tie us perpetually to the wheel of existence, with its accompany- ing burdens of joy and sorrow, birth and death. The well-known word Amen is composed of the first letters of the words jr.:~:J 1'?1.:l ';)11-1, \"Lord, Faith- ful King \", which open the Hebrew prayer called the Sehemah, TEMURAH The third method is called 'I'emurah, meaning Permuta- tion. The letters of a word are transposed, according to definite schemes, and substituted for another letter before or after it in the alphabet, forming an entirely new word. One method, known as Albam, is to take the Alphabet and place the last half below the first half as follows : ::l f::) n 'r , rt i :J ::l ~ n w ~ p ~ ~ ~ 0 :J ~ ? Various permutations are arrived at, for the top row of letters may be substituted for those in the bottom row, and vice versa. An interesting example is supplied by a Qabalist with whom the writer is somewhat acquainted. The word n'~~ Messiah, when treated by the above-mentioned mode of permutation, gives us the word j:~'::l Bishak. The M is substituted for B, the Sh for a Y (or I), the Y for Sh, and the Ch for Q. Not having a Hebrew dictionary at my side at the ~oment of writing, I am not able to enquire as to whether there is such a Hebrew word as J -'~. But a little knowledge of Hebrew grammar and our Qabalistic corres- pondences will suffice, and the difficulty is soon overcome. The first letter ::l B may be construed to be the pre positional prefix meaning \"in\", \"with\", or \"by\", leaving the three letters r~' Yishak. The numerical value of these letters is 410, viz: '10 + tv 300 + ji 100 = 410. Now there is a Hebrew word w\"i' Qadosh, whose value is 410 also, and it means a \" Saint\", or\" Holiness\". Obviously, this is harmonious with our original word Messiah, for will not the Messiah come with holiness and in sanctity? '"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"desire of the writer to be drawn into the maelstrom of con- troversy with regard to the character or nature of Jesus, the individual sacred to Christians; nor is it his intention to engage in polemics as to whether Jesus actually lived, whether he was a great Adept, or simply a solar myth, as many of the exponents of the higher criticism claim. The Qabalah simply uses the name nlwn'l Yeheshua because it implies a certain philosophy descriptive of certain of its prime theorems. This is a point which must be remem- bered. The name refers to a definite type, and not to any individual. The letters mn'l YHVH of the Tetragrammaton are used to imply the whole gamut of the four elements. 'I Y as the creative function of the Archetypal Realm, is Fire the Chiah; the first rt H represents the Cup, the symbol of the passive character of the Creative World, and is Water the Neschamah; , V is the Son, the active vice-regent of the Father, and is Air the Ruach; and the final H n is the Nephesch; the passive receptive Earth, fructifying all things. The whole word, comprising the totality of these explana- tions, is conceived by the Qabalah to represent the unre- generate man, who lives entirely in his body, eating, drinking, and copulating, etc. The Divine Self or the Yechidah has not yet made its appearance within him. In the course of the practise of Meditation and Practical Qabalah, it is conceived that a man so regenerates and purifies himself, that he opens himself to the Holy Spirit, w~ich completely revitalizes him, exemplifying in him a living testimony of the Word made Flesh. The Holy Spirit or the Shechinah, as we have already observed, is symbolized by the. letter W Shin. When, therefore, a man has invoked the Spiritual Self, his Holy Guardian Angel, and attained to His Knowledge and Con- versation, the process is described as the descent of the letter W Shin into the midst of the elemental name of mn'l Tetragrammaton, thus forming a new word rnerr- Yeheshua, the Pentagrammaton, the symbol of a new being, the Adept or Tsaddik in whom the birth of Spirit has equilibrized the base and unredeemed elements of matter. There is obviously no Christian bias in this interpretation, 112 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES Some little time after the above passage was written, the writer had the opportunity to consult a Hebrew lexicon in which he discovered much confirmatory matter; that rw' may be considered primarily as a verb in the future tense, third person singular, and in all probabilit~ derived from the root derivative meaning \"to burn, kmdle, or light \" . . All these words are very much in accord with the general implication of the Messiah or Adept who comes with sanctity, for these words symbolize the facts which apper- tain to the state of him who is God-Man, the regenerated and illuminated Adept. For within his heart, his Soul is enkindled and upon his brows the lissome light of the Silver Star doth radiate-his \" light shining before him\"; and above his head burns the thousand and one petalled lotus of the Sahasrara Chakra upon which the Shechinah has descended, and wherein Adonai doth disport himself with the Gods. The method of letter analysis, previously described, helps to clarify the general conception. :J B is ~ M~rcur~, the Magician bearing in his hand th~ Wand repr~sentmg ~llS Divine Will and Wisdom. 'I Y IS the Tarotic Hermit ; also it is the symbol of innocence and spiritual virginity. ~ Sh is the Holy Spirit, his Divine Self which has been successfully invoked in the thaumaturgic rites. i' Q is * Pisces, the Fishes; representing the regenerated sex force, or libido, transmuted into the Kundalini which Madame Blavatsky informs us is an electric spiritual force, the great pristine creative power. i'~'J itself yields the number 412, as follows: i' 100 +1&1 300+\" 10+J 2=412. The words l:N1?t-l n1trm'l Yeheshua Elohim, translated by Yeheshua (or Jesus) is God also have the same numerical value, 412. The co:respondence of all this with the idea of Messia~ is certainly most clear. Numerous other examples, deal~ng mainly with the Scriptures, have been worked o~t WIth laborious painstaking and ingenuity by the Qaballsts. I doubt, however, that they are sufficiently important to warrant mention here. A few remarks are necessary ~t,this point, since the name Jesus has been introduced into this work. It is not the THE LITERAL QABALAH 118"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"114 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES as unfair critics have alleged, the symbolism being merely used as graphically descriptive of what is considered to be a real fact in mystical experience, without having the slight- est reference to the central figurehead of the New Testa- ment. I make this remark to reassure those of my readers who may be of Jewish persuasion. Having made reference to Pentagrammaton I should indulge, perhaps, in a little explanation of its significance. The attributions with reference to the actual geometrical figure are as follows: The Yod l'epresents Fire; the He primal is Water; Shin, the crowning point is the Shechinah, the Holy Spirit ; Vav is Air; and He final is Earth, the synthesis of all the other elements and principles. The symbol is therefore one which denotes the whole of the constitution of man. Those of my readers who may befamiIiar with the processes of cere- monial Magick, particularly that having reference to Skry- ing in the Spirit Vision, will recall the power of this five- pointed star to invoke or banish, at will, the spirits of the Astral Plane. That it does actually do so is referable finally to the fact that it is a very adequate geometrical epitome of a completely enlightened man, the Tsaddik or Adept, than whom there is no more powerful being in the universe. The little grammatical suggestions given with regard to THE LITERAL QABALAH 115 the Hebrew letters also are most important. I shall give an example to illustrate the idea. One Qabalist of tremendous knowledge was endeavouring !o tr~nsliterate into Hebrew the name ofa prseterhuman m~c1hgence ?y the name of Aiwass. This is, of course, nel~her the tln;.e nor the place to go into the reason for his desire .to obtam this name in Hebrew, and yet have the numerical value of 418. Had this Qabalist, whom the writer greatly esteems, known of the remark made with regard to the letter of the thirty-second Path, riTav, he would have b~en saved several years of effort. For that letter when without a dOgish, is pronounced as an \" S \". Aiwass should have been spelt : 11 400+N 1+, 6+' 10+~1=418. Th.ose of m~ rea~ers who are familiar with Qabalistic termmology will notice too that in this work n'''~::J::> has been rendered as \" Sephiros \" and not\" Sephiroth\". The la\"st .letter does not, and cannot in Hebrew grammar, take a dogish at the end of a word. Its pronunciation is therefore \"S\". At th~ close o~ this exegetical chapter on the methods of Gematrl,a, Notariqon, and Temurah, it is perhaps advisable to mentIOn, that, to. the so-called ordinary individual, these ~ethods will be of little or practically no real use.

I~ this connection, however, I recall to mind a saying attributed to the Buddha, I believe, that only an Arahat ~an ~ull~ comprehend the excellence of the Dhamma. The implication of this statement applies likewise and with even gr~a~er emphasis to the Qabalah.

Its way proceeds undeviat- ingly forward and forward, upward and upw~rd, unto that Goal which has neither beginning nor endll~g, s~art nor finish, but journeys eternally in every direction and dimension into Infinity. CHAPTER SEVEN THE LITERAL QABALAH (continued) I T should by now be abundantly clear to even the most casual reader, after this description of the thirty-two Paths of Wisdom and the outline of the Qabalistic ideas of number, that the more knowledge of every kind one has at one's disposal, and the greater one's experience, the more will the system commend itself as a mode of classifica- tion. It cannot be too clearly emphasized that this being a system for the classification of all ideas, there is nothing which cannot be comprehended in it. No attempt, there- fore, has been made to give here a large number of cor- respondences, as this is a task which must be -left for individual research. The writer must be pardoned for reiterating this so frequently, but it is so important that he grasps every opportunity to drive the point home. At first sight the whole system of the Sephirothal Tree, with the manifold correspondences to be utilized as a psychological or spiritual classifying system, may appear to the reader as wholly unintelligible. But with a little serious application, the lapse of time will show an unconscious assimilation-c-analogous to the seed of a tree taking root silently, secretly, in the dark. depths of Mother Earth. When the seed has at last sent forth shoots and roots seek- ing nourishment and something it can grasp and hold on to, the tender stalk pushes its way upwards towards the Sun, the source of light and life. So also with the fundamental principles of the Qabalah. First the original seed of the few important correspondences, upon which the whole superstructure depends, should be committed to memory and made an integral part of one's everyday consciousness. In order to facilitate study, the reader who is really interested in proving to himself the inestimable value of the Tree of Life as a method of 117"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"118 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LITERAL QABALAH 119 classification, should procure a tray which contains what is known as a card index. This, in reality, is but a small box holding a number of blank cards. These should be divided into several compartments, numbered from 1 to 32. Every correspondence mentioned in the previous chapters should then be entered on a card by itself and placed in its proper position, under its appropriate number. Then the student should briefly enter on to each card the various facts of which he is cognisant concerning each of those attributions and take steps to acquire a deeper knowledge concerning some of the items which are new. In this very practical way, he will be classifying the whole of his knowledge into thirty-two compartments, and any new facts which he thereafter obtains will be automatically grouped under some one of these divisions. When this task has been thoroughly accomplished, he should endeavour to reduce in his own mind the information contained in these thirty- two divisions with their multitudinous facts to Ten, the number of the Sephiros-and finally to One. This last task will be rendered much more simple if the relation obtaining between the Paths and the Sephiros, and the shape of the Tree itself, is borne in mind. All the attri- butions should be carefully traced and correlated by the reader to that harmonious and symmetrical shape which is formed by the ten Sephiros and the twenty-two Paths. He should remember, too, the triune nature of each unit; it receives from above, retains and expresses its own nature, and transmits the influence to that which is below. This is the root foundation upon which all further study must be based. As the study progresses, a more complete and intelligible set of attributions should be filed in these original jackets, and the Tree will be observed to grow under one's very eyes. The correspondences of each unit may be indefinitely extended, since each Sephirah and each subsidiary Path may be visualized as containing a Tree of Life within its own sphere, and may thus be divided for the purpose of more precise and close analysis into ten subdivisions. The Tree itself may also be placed in each of, what are called, The Four Worlds in the Qabalistic Scheme of Evolution. The Sephirothic scheme was originally concerned with the mysteries of evolution, and the Qabalists conceived of the evolution of the cosmos in a complex manner. By a kind of flowing forth or emanation from Ain, it was held that there were produced in succession four Worlds or Planes of Consciousness. The Tree, therefore, is divided into four different regions of consciousness, of four cosmic planes in which the creative flow or pulsating stream of life proceeds. The first of these four creative planes is Olam Atsilus, the World of Emanations or the Archetypal World. The second is Olam Briah, the Creative World. The third is Olam Yetsirah, the Formative World, all the above finding expression and dynamic concretion in Olam Assiah, the World of Action or the Material World, which the Zohar considers to be the abiding truth of the harmonious co- operation of all the Sephiros, making the universe in all its orderliness and symmetry a true and exact manifestation of the Thought Divine of the Archetypal World. The Zoharic authority for this philosophic conception is to be found in Zohar, i, 156 et seq. : \" All that which exists upon the Earth, has its spiritual counterpart on high, and there exists nothing in this world which is not attached to something Above, and is not found in dependence upon it. \" All that which is contained in the lower world is also found in prototype. The Lower and the Upper reciprocally act upon each other.\" This division is contemplated in two distinct manners. In tl1ejirst method, Keser-the Sphere of the Primum Mobile- occupies the first plane alone. It is the Archetype and Creator of all the other Sephiros. Chokmah and Binah are considered as the Creative World, the region of Ideation and Cosmic Energization, from which evolves the World of Formation, consisting of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth Sephiros. The World of Formation con- stitutes the Astral Plane, comprising various degrees of subtle and electric matter and energy. The whole is syn- thesized in the physical world, Malkus, the tenth Sephirah, which is, in this mode of consideration, Olam Assiah, The Zohar, moreover, takes the name YHVH, which is"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"121 THE LITERAL QABALAH the Tetragrammaton, and attributes each letter of this word to some one of the four Worlds. Yod to the Arche- typal World, the first He to the Creative World, Vav to the Formative World, and the final He being allocated to the Material World. In the second method, the Zohar places a whole Tree of ten Sephiros in each of the Four Worlds. The Archetypal World is the highest, being absolutely ideal. It is the plane of the Divine Thought, the Causal. Plane of Cosmic Idea- tion, or the Mahat of Blavatskian Theosophy. The ten Archetypal Sephiros project themselves into the World of Briah, a plane less spiritual and less abstract. Here the creative forces of the Gods seize upon the arche- typal ideas of things, expanding and vivifying and develop- ing the Tree on that particular plane. This is the mental plane proper, comparable in cosmieal constitution to the conception of the Ruach or the lower Manas of Theosophy in man. The lowest Sephirah in Atsilus thus becomes the Keser in Briah, as the accompanying diagram shows, and the Malkus of Briah becomes the Keser of Yetsirah, and so on down the scale. In the Formative World, which is the plane of the Astral forces, the ideas are projected still further, being clothed here in a design or model form of electric and magnetic matter. The astral substance is an omnipresent and all- permeating fluid of extremely subtile matter, of substance in a highly tenuous state, and in the process of further evolution, it produces, and acts as the substratum to, the material world, which is a copy of the astral in more dense and gross material. In this manner, should a large number of triads be reo quired for comparative purposes-such as may be required for the attributing of the triadic categories of the Hegelian Philosophy to the Tree of Life-we obtain by this means a system of twelve triads, with a pendant of a thirteenth Sephirah in Assiah. The Tarot cards likewise have been attributed to these four Worlds. The set of cards consists of Twenty-two Trumps attributed to the Hebrew Alphabet; four suits of fourteen cards each, entitled Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles, The first ten of each suit, as we have already , I \\ I , I \\ I , I o ,.8, ,. , ,. , > <.... , ...

The King has been depicted as sitting passively on a throne, and the Prince or Knight, astride a horse in full gallop, actively brandishing his weapons. In reality, the symbols should be reversed, for the King (the Demiurgos or Maeroprosopus in Keser) who seen, were attributed to the Sephiros. The remaining four in each suit are the Court cards, King, Queen, Prince or Knight, and Princess or Page, and are attributed to the letters of the Tetragrammaton and to the Four' Creative Worlds. In the painting of modern sets, a number of mistakes represents Olarn Atsilus, is creative and positive, and trans- mits the stream of life to the Queen, who is the Mother, Olarn Briah, abiding patiently and passively as the work of creation goes on within her. The Prince or Knight (the Mieroprosopus situate in Tipharas), representing Olarn Yetsirah, is similar in function to the King but subsisting on a much lower plane, he receiving the ideas and force of the Father from 'the Mother, which impressions he in turn imparts to the Princess or Page, who is the Virgin, Olarn Assiah, The names of the suits, too, are descriptive to a very large extent of the nature of the Worlds. The Wand is the magical symbol of the Creative Will which evolves the original archetypal ideas in Olarn Atsilus. They are pro- jected into Olam Briah, the Creative World, symbolized by the Cups. The Cup obviously is a feminine symbol, passive, and receptive, eager to receive the male influence from on high. The Sword relates to the Formative Plane, since the sword cuts, forms, and hews. The Pantacles, being formed of wax-a symbol of earth, passive and inert-symbolize the World of Action and matter, wherein the forces of the more transcendent planes have their field of manifestation. Only one word of caution is here required. It must not be supposed that these Worlds are above one another in space or time. Such is not the Zoharic idea. This is one of the main drawbacks of diagrammatic representations. They are realms of consciousness each having an appropriate vehicle of matter, some more subtile, others more dense, than the other. Blavatsky states that they are\" in co- adunition but not in consubstantiality \". The implication of this rather formidable phrase is that their substance is not of the same degree of density, although spatially they may occupy the same position. The distinction, however, is of quality of matter, not of position in space. A few remarks are necessary with regard to methods of viewing the Tree and its shape in general. In Chapter Three the reader will have observed from the diagrams that there were three Triads of Sephiros, culminating in the pendant of a tenth Sephirah which was called Malkus. There is, however, another way of looking at this Tree. The Sephiros arrange themselves in Columns, for there are ; \" \" \" \" \" \" / , I ~----------t---------- ~.t~h V.

Chokmah, Chesed, and Netsach are those on the Right hand, and t! comprise what is called the Pillar of Mercy, comparable to the Column Yachin of the Freemasons. Binah, Geburah, and Hod, are the Sephiros on the Left, and they are denominated the Pillar of Severity-the Masonic Boaz; while the four Sephiros of Keser, Tipharas, Yesod, and Malkus, the main trunk of the Tree, comprise together the Middle Pillar. It will be very interesting for the reader to note, in con- nection with the Middle Pillar, the words used in Exodus with regard to Aaron's wand or the rod of Almond. The words are ij:'::Ji1 i1b~ Jj;latoh haShaked. By Gematria the numerical value of these two words is ascertained to be 463. From our Chapter Four, 400 is seen to be Tav m the thirty-second Path leading from Malkus to Yesod. 60 is the Path of Samech t:l ·leading from Yesod to Tipharas. 3 is the thirteenth Path, Gimel, which joins Tipharas directly to the Crown. The whole idea of the wand of Aaron the High Priest, implies the shaft con- necting the Sephiros on the Middle Pillar-s-a straight road from the Kingdom to the Crown. The question may arise in the mind of the student of Philosophy at this juncture as to whether the Qabalah resolves itself into an objective or a subjective scheme. That is to say, is the world as it is perceived through the five senses the result of the creativity of my spiritual ego, having no existence outside of my own consciousness, or does the Qabalah regard the Universe as both subjective and. objective? . . . A study of Qabalistic ideology and correspondences would lead one to suppose that it accepts the absolute reality of external things in the most objective sense. It is, if n~mc it we must, an Objective Idealism. All our per- ceptions are not exclusively of the Ego, nor of that which is perceived; they are the representations of a certain rela- tion and interaction between the two. We cannot affirm any quality in an object as being independent of our sense apparatus. Nor, on the other hand, dare we assume that what we do cognize is more than a partial representation of its cause. We are unable to determine, for example, the meaning of such ideas as motion, or distinguish between space and time, except in relation to some particular ob- server and some particular thing observed. For instance, if during experimentation, a huge cannon were fired twice at an interval of three hours, a Solar entity would note a; difference of several. thousand miles in space 'between the shots, rather than three hours difference in time. We .are absolutely incapable,however, of perceiving phenomena except through the senses. It would be quite correct, hence, from a purely Qabalistic viewpoint, .to assume that the Universe is also subjective without denying in the Ieast.itso bjecti vi ty. . .. In reality, however, I mu,st add as a cautionary warning that the Qabalah does not concern itself with the rational solution of the objectivity or subjectivity of the Universe. It is primarily, assn frequently emphasized here, a psych- ological system for the comparison and classification of all ideas and experiences. The student will undoubtedly begin to wonder how it is possible to correlate the abstract mythological conceptions inherent in our .Sephiros to the ideology of the various academic systems of philosophy. This is not a particularly difficult task, once one has a perfect string of correspon- dences established in one's mind. Let. us take, for instance, the critical idealism of Kant. The Uni:verse as existing in time and space is considered to beasubjective .. creation of the. perceiving Ego, such ideas' as-time and space being a priori categories or forms Qf creative thinking. How, now, can. we establish a corre- spondence between our Qabalah and the concept just mentioned? / Keser has been. defined as the Ego, the Monad, \"the / secret centre in the heart of everyman\". Keser, hence, is our Transcendental Ego. 'I'o Binah, we found' that Kronos o~ Time was attributed. Thus Binah links up with the Kantian category of Time. The Sphere of the Zodiac is a correspondence of Chokmah, and is, in a certain respect, a concretion of the idea of Space. We have, therefore, the whole Universe as the lower seven Sephiros, projected and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"126 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES existing in Time and Space, or Chokmah and Binah, which are the functions of the integrating faculty of the Ego or Kesel'. The student will find it no difficult matter to corre- late the remaining Kantian categories, or forms of the activity of the thinking ego, to the Sephirothal Tree. When we come to consider Fichte and Hegel, we find a very close analogy indeed between the Emanation system of the Qabalah, which proceeds in triads, male, female, and child; and the dialectical process which has its expression in a positive or outgoing movement, its opposite or nega- tive, and the reconciliation. There attaches hereto, however, another problem of paramount importance upon which it is necessary to comment before proceeding any further. The fact that the Sephiros fall into triads or trinities, and the fact that such titles as the Father, the Mother, and the Son, have been ascribed to them, has been the means of encouraging many an apologist on behalf of Christianity to argue without sufficient basis that the Christian trinity is implicit in the Qabalah. I quote Prof. Abelson in connection with this argument: \" It is beyond a doubt that the resemblance is quite a matter of accident. • • • The philosophy of Salomon Ibn Gabirol, Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Philonism, and other systems have all left indelible traces (i.e. on the evolution of the Qabalah). But Christianity, be it remembered, besides being a debtor to Judaism, is a debtor to these sources as well; so that what appears to be Christian may be, in reality, Jewish; a development of the original material by an unbroken succession of Jewish minds. . . . But it is beyond dispute that the Christian Trinity and the trinities of the ten Sefirot lie in quite distinct planes.\" On this subject I feel in my deepest heart that to Mr. Arthur Edward Waite there is due a great debt of gratitude. For although Mr. Waite frankly confesses himself to be a Christian-and let it be remembered, moreover, a Christian holding obedience to the See of Rome; or so I gather from his writings-he has analysed notwithstanding, with the utmost care, the possible comparisons which might be drawn between the Christian Trinitarian concept and the Qabalistic Sephiros bearing the titles of the Holy Family. THE LITERAL QABALAH 127 In his Holy Kaballah, for one thing, he proves conclusively and at great length that the Shechinah attributed to the Sephirah Binah is not to be construed as being identical in nature or definition with the Holy Ghost. He observes in a.ddition, although somewhat unnecessarily in my estima- tion, that the philosophy attaching to the union of the Zoharic Yod and Heh primal in the Olam Atsilus would be repugnant to the devout Trinitarian. I need not labour the point here that the Christian Trinity would be even more reprehensible and worthy of all contempt to the venerable Rabbis of the Holy Assemblies. From my point. of view, to attend to the problem itself, there cannot possibly be the slightest connection between the two philosophic formulations which have been at the foundation of virulent controversy. Because, let me insist most strongly, the two Schools under consideration specu- late upon two entirely different topics. According to the Chur~h, the various aspects of the Trinity are, severally, all One 111 God. Despite this, however, so Athanasius tells us each individual Person, in itself, is God. ' N~t so accor~ing to the Qabalah. Ain Soph is the Infimte; Etermty, transcendent and immanent. It can- not even be said to be One, since it is Zero' and One is an attribute as we have already seen of manifestation and limitation. Those Sephiros which bear such titles as Father and Moth~r cannot, per se, under any circumstances, be God or Am Soph. The Zohar teaches distinctly that the Se~hiros are ~i~ply kechleem, vessels or channels through WhICh the DIVIne forces of creative evolution manifest themselves .. The Sephiros to which Father and Mother are allocated. are ~10t Ain Soph. Permeated and sustained by the Infimte LIfe though they always are, they are realized to be but manifestations. The real solution of the would-be comparison is, in point of fact, a remarkably simple one, since there can be no comparison at all. So simple is this solution that insofar as I a?1.aware it has escaped those who revel in logical hair- splitting and argument. The ideas in the minds ofthe early Church Fathers and the Doctors of the Law were not in accord. The Church taught of Three Persons who are eternally the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"128 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES I cannot understand that this metaphysical formulation has any other than the most remote relationship to the Qabalistic concept of the Tetragrammaton, the four- lettered name of God. Its allocations are the Yod and the first Heh, the Father and Mother in. Transcendence ;.and the Vav and Heh final, the Son and the Daughter, twins, below. In other words, this Holy Family consists not oj ' Three individuals, but of Four. It should be quite obvious to even the merest tyro in philosophy that two distinct sys'- tems are here being propounded, the one having little or nothing to do with the other. The defence raised by Dr. Abelson is, therefore, no defence at all, since he is. endeavouring to demonstrate that the Jews have not borrowed from the Christians. Actually this question does not enter into the controversy. . There has been one final attempt to attach a fourth person to the Christian Trinity in the shape of the mystical body of Christ which is the Roman Catholic Church. So feeble a last resort indeed casts reflection upon the minds in whom it originated. . Yet on this whole subject there have ensued polemics which have been perpetuated for over three hundred years in pure ignorance of Qabalistic essentials. Reuchlin, Mirandola, Knorr von Rosenroth, Lully, and others studied the Qabalah primarily in the deceitful anticipation that therein might be ascertained doctrines analogous to the Christian faith; doctrines with which to compel the sons of Israel to shave their beards and cut their forelocks; to forsake the faith and counsel of their fathers, and partake of the communion according to the Rite of Rome. With but a few exceptions they failed in the latter, despite wilful perversion of Zoharic doctrine. Many a Rabbi of ortho- doxy, as a direct result, levelled venomous hatred and fiery vituperation against the Zohar, accepting a priori the belief of his uncircumcized persecutors that Christianity, or at least the contention that the Trinity and the nomination of Christ as the Jewish Messiah, appeared in the Zohar. The fault lies with them also for the neglect of so great 8 heritage. It is necessary for the student to make a strong effort to grasp the doctrine of the Tetragrammaton as briefly THE LITERAL QABALAH 129 developed in Chapters Three and Five. Upon an under- standing of this formula depends his realization that the Zohar and the Qabalah stands as a. body of doctrine altogether independent-of what has proceeded from within the Sanctorum of the Catholicism as obtains at Rome. He will then find. himself the possessor of sufficient knowledge preventing his fall into so shallow a booby trap as that described above, and provide the basis upon which he I can erect a towering edifice of magical theory and practice. To really appreciate. the triadic movement of the Sephiros In the descent from ideality to actuality one should possess a knowledge of philosophy from Plato to Hegel. This triple action of movement, its negation and reconciliation (considered by Hegel to be a kind of logical controversy) is universally held to be the true method of philosophy. The Qabalah advancing by means of this Dialectical process, in priority to Hegel and Spencer, pro- pounds a highly 'comprehensive system of evolution in which-to make use of Spencer's well-known formula: \" There is a continuous change from indefinite incoherent homogeneity (Ain) to definite heterogeneity of structure and function (Mall<us) through successive differentiations and integrations\" (the intervening Sephiros). Fichte in his philosophic researches, in starting from the Ego (Keser) found it-to possess knowledge, thought, and consciousness. He claimed that thinking is not the essence of the Ego, but merely one of its activities (below the Abyss, the Qabalah would add), and so he arrived, by an examina- tio~ of the act of thought, at his first three principles. By means of the dialectic, acknowledging the Self (Keser\"- the Crown) as a starting-point, involving whatever one knows and experiences, he attempted to overcome the Kantian dualism, which separated the phenomenal from the noumenal worlds, and made the latter\" unknowable\". First, there is the Ego, Self or Subject, given in every cog- nition; infinite and inexhaustible in nature; but obscure, for we know it only in its activity-s-which has a special form, the\" positing\" or the putting forth of energy, pure activity, the manifestation of the Self. This produces the Object, the opposite of Self, the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"180 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LITERAL QABALAH 181 non-ego (Non-Being of Hegel), which corresponds to Binah, since the latter is the root of matter, and the opposite of Being. The object is its first alien, which acts upon the Self and is acted upon by it. They are then recognized in reciprocal relation, and the interaction resolves itself in the harmony of self-knowledge (the third principle), or Chok- mah, Wisdom, our second Sephirah. One meets with a perfect foreshadowing of the German idealisms in various of the writings of some of the early Qabalists, and the following quotation from Rabbi Moses Cordovero is quite good philosophy: \" The first three Sephiros must be considered as one and the same thing. The first represents' knowledge \" the second 'the knower', the third 'that which is known '. The Creator is Himself, at one and the same time, know- ledge, the knower, and the known. Indeed, His manner of knowing does not consist in applying His thought to things outside Him; it is by self-knowledge that He knows and perceives everything which is. There exists nothing which is not united to Him and which He does not find in His own essence. He is the type of all being, and all things exist in Him under their most pure and perfect form. . • • It is thus that all existing things in the universe have their form in the Sephiros, and the Sephiros have theirs in the source from which they emanate.\" Another instance in an entirely new direction is necessary perhaps to demonstrate the manner in which Qabalistic knowledge may be applied. In his Swarthmore Lecture, Science and the Unseen World, Prof. A. S. Eddington pointed out that \" out of the electric charges dispersed in the primitive chaos ninety-two different kinds of matter- ninety-two chemical elements-have been built. . . . At root the diversity of the ninety-two elements reflects the diversity of the integers from one to ninety-two'\" because the chemical characteristics of element No. 11 (sodium) arise from the fact that it has the power at low temperature of gathering round it eleven negative electric charges; those of No. 12 (magnesium) from its power of gathering twelve particles; and so on\". At this point I shall leave the Swarthmore Lecture to ask the reader to consider with me a highly significant passage taken from Sir James Jeans' recent work, The :Mysterious Universe. I quote from page 8 : \" To-day one phenomenon after another which was at one time attributed to ' vital force' is being traced to the action of the ordinary processes of physics and chemistry. Although the problem is still far from solution, it is becom- ing increasingly likely that what specially distinguishes the matter of living bodies is the presence not of a ' vital force \" but of the quite commonplace element carbon. . • . If this is so, life exists in the universe only because the carbon atom possesses certain exceptional properties. • . . So far nothing is known to account for its very special capacity for binding other atoms together. The carbon atom consists of six electrons revolving around the appropriate central nucleus. . • •\" In his Swarthmore Lecture, Eddington continues an identical theme, stating that the electronic structure of the element carbon is responsible for, and provides the physical basis of, life. Now this conception of things very closely approximates that adopted by the Qabalists. For the moment I shall deal solely with the element carbon, leaving the reader to work out for himself the correspondences of sodium and mag- nesium mentioned by Eddington. The manifestation of Life is, the Qabalists assert, definitely connected with, and is part of the connotation of, the number Six. Carbon itself is concerned with combustion, combustion with fire and heat; the latter, ultimately, with the Sun. We may assume that Carbon is a manifestation, or the underlying basis, of life in the microcosm, and the Sun the source of Life in the Macrocosm. It will have been observed that one of the several cor- respondences given to the sixth Sephirah of Tipharas or Harmony on page 61 was the Sun. It is quite obvious, of course, that we are completely dependent on the solar orb and on its life-giving heat and vitality for our very existence. There could be not the slightest manifestation of life at all on this globe-at least no form of life as we know life; no mineral kingdom, none of the exuberant and luxuriant vegetation which we love so dearly, no animal life of any description-were we cut off in some"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"132 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LITERAL QABALAH 133 way from the rays of our parent Sun, with all its sustenance and warmth. Yet the Qabalah goes still further, as will have been seen. Not only is the Sun our Father from the physical viewpoint, but our inner spiritual existence, which is the real life of us, is intimately bound up in all sorts of ways with that of the Sun. The Sun as we see it is the outer vehicle of the inner Spiritual Sun; the flaming garment of a God ora group of Gods of whose nature we are part and parcel, and from whose life we may not be separated, just as the cells which consti- tute our own organism are bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh, and soul of our soul. As one of the magical rituals- adapted from the Egyptian Book of the Dead-expresses it: \"I am the Eidolon of my father Tmu, Lord of the City of the Sun\". The student of ancient religions, too, will note with great interest in this connection the undeniable fact that the great teachers or Adepts (those who attained to 'I'ipharas, at least, the Sephirah of (3); see next chapter) who have left their impress on popular worship-Attis, Adonis, Osiris, Mithra, Dionysius, and Jesus Christ-have become, almost without exception, identified with the cycle of the Sun's journey through the heavens, or rather to be some- what more accurate, the cycle of their lives attached itself to the greater cycle of the Sun. The Nativity occurring at the winter solstice, the Crucifixion at the equinox of spring, all suggest the birth Of the year and the elevation of the Sun above the equator. There are numerous varia- tions upon this theme, but the symbols are nearly always equivalent. The subject of the picture or the story is ever the same; it is that eternal miracle of abounding life, ever self-restored, triumphant over death-s-the return of the Sun.: Six, then, may imply carbon and the idea of the physical elements necessary for the manifestation of life, but to the Qabalist, as we have shown, it means infinitely more; his mind immediately refers the number Six to everything connected with the Sun, its esoteric noumenon, its earthly emissaries, and spiritual consciousness as a whole. To continue the quotation from Jeans' book: \" The phenomenon of permanent magnetism appears in a tremendous degree in iron, and ina lesser degree in its neighbours, nickel and cobalt. • • . The atoms of these elements have 26, 27, and 28. electrons respectively .••• As a consequence of these laws, atoms having a certain definite number of electrons, namely 6, 26 to 28 ••• have certain special properties which show themselves in the phenomenon of life, magnetism, and radio-activity respectively. \" These numbers 6, 26, 27, and 289111 link up quite definitely ,,\\ith conceptions held in the Qabalistic scheme to sym- bolize the same qualities recognized by scientific. thinkers to inhere in atoms with the number of electrons just men- tioned. The carbon atom with its six electrons can be attributed harmoniously to the sixth Sephirah as was done above,and we may now examine the other three numbers with the view of ascertaining in what way they connect with the philosophic principles heretofore outlined. Path No. 26 on the Tree of Life is the letter Ayin, whose attributions are emblematical of the various creative forces of Nature represented, particularly, by Priapus the fecund God; implying too the idea of cosmic desire and instinct which manifests, for example, as the cohesive attraction or magnetism of one molecule for another. The letter Peh is the twenty-seventh Path, and its main attribution is Mars, which is the electric vitalising force animating and permeating all things. Tradition attributes iron to Peh, the number 27, although here there is some slight difference with modern science which states that the element iron has 26 electrons. By considering, however, the central proton with the 26 revolving electrons we have 27, 'r hich is Peh. This is arbitrary and open to question however. Twenty-eight is the Path of Tsaddi which joins Netsach to Yesod. The meaning ot-this Path ofTsaddi is best dis- covered by an analysis of the Sephiros which it joins on the Sephirothal Tree. The chart will show this path joining Netsach and Yesod. Netsach is the sphere of Venus, and . the whole implication of this Sephirah was stated as that of love of a sexual nature, representing the generative forces of Nature; therefore magnetism and desire are the implica- tions in general. Yesod is the Foundation to which the Astral Plane is attributed, and the astral substance is by"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"134 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES definition magnetic, subtile, and electric in its nature. Although the term \"radio-activity\" was not used in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, nevertheless the reader will be able to ascertain without difficulty that the description of the qualities of astral matter are almost identical with those given by present-day scientific investi- gators to those elements which are said to be radio-active. Enough has been stated above, I think, to show the reader on what lines to proceed in making use of the Qabalah as a system for the comparison of ideas. The examples given are not intended to be anything more than suggestive, and it is to be hoped that, in the not far distant future, some student will provide for us a comprehensive survey of the entire history of philosophy with a comparison of its major developments to the ideology of the Qabalah, and a carefully tabulated classification showing the elec- tronic constitution of the ninety-two elements side by side with an elaborate series of Qabalistic correspondences. CHAPTER EIGHT THE LADDER W E have considered at length the Tree of Life as a phil~sophic~l alpha~et. It is now necessary to consider this Tree III an altogether new light. In the different limbs of this structure we previously found a quality corresponding to a similar innate quality in man which must be unfolded, developed, and perfected. This process of unfoldment is called, graphically, \"Climbing the Tree\". An earlier chapter stated briefly that the methods of the Qabalah were two: Meditation and Magick. A few explanatory remarks are now required. Since it has been shown that the Ruach is denied us, because of its own limitations, to aid us in the Quest for Truth, and since Faith as ordinarily apprehended is even more useless-a new method for philosophical research is highly desirable. In fact, not only a new method but an entirely new direction in which research must be furthered. In Positivism, men have denied a transcendental region of consciousness almost entirely because, not admitting the possibility of relations other than those formulated by logicians, they denied the very existence of the things which 8.J>pear to be illogical from the viewpoint of those forrnulse. Modern \"spiritualism \", for instance, attempted to con- struct a noumenal world on the model of the phenomenal; but it wanted to prove at all costs that the\" other world\" is logical from our standpoint; that the same laws operated there in much the same way they do here, and that the \" other world\" is nothing more or less than a copy and an extension of ours. It is, in short, a crude and barbaric formulation of the unknown. Positive Philosophy naturally perceived the absurdity of all these dualistic theses, but having no power to expand or 135"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"136 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LADDER 137 extend the field of its activity, limited by its logic, it could think of nothing better than to deny. Mystical-Philosophy alone has felt the possibility. of relations other than those ·of the phenomenal world, and formulated a logic applicable to the supersensuous and transcendental consciousness. But it was arrested in its progress by hazy and unclear conceptions of organized and sceptical research, finding it impossible to define and classify its material in a scientific way. This may be cor- rected, and a thorough sceptical system instituted using the Qabalistie Tree as a classifying medium; . Ultimately Science must come to the Qabalah, because it alone provides a comprehensive method and a newdirec- tion for research. Mystical and magical methods open to us . not only a new type of experience-c-accompanied by psychological phenomena indeed worthy of scientific research-but what is much more important, and worth while, they extend added knowledge of a transcendental region of consciousness. In his Tertium Organum, P. D. Ouspensky writes: \"The entire body of teachings ofreligio-philosophic movements have as their avowed or hidden purpose, the expansion of consciousness. This also is the aim of mysticism of every age and of every faith, the aim of occultism and of the Oriental Yoga.\" The methods of the Qabalah particularly-since it alone of all others appears to possess the one basis pre-eminently suitable for synthesis-enlarge our vision of the universe by means of an experience variously called religious, mystical, or supra-rational. And by this is meant an experience, nay, an immediate intuition, a spontaneous insight into the meaning, the nature, andthe value of the Universe, giving a beatific vision of how all things belong together,a clue to the nature of Ultimate Reality. We deal here with an essential fact in mystical knowledge; the superseding of the ordinary activities of the rational consciousness in a direct intuition wherein the Neschamah gazes directly upon ideas. And experience, whether secular or mystical, must always be the ultima thule, beyond which one dare not go, nor which one dare negate. In setting up the Mystical Experience as the source of inspiration and knowledge, we only have recourse to true scientific principle for, as Julian Huxley has expressed it in What Dare 1 Think?: \"the most important characteristic of the scientific method IS its constant reference back to experience in the search for knowledge\" . The first of these methods is meditation. The Jews have long been acquainted with various technical methods of meditation. Their scriptures scintillate with many sublime examples of men whose experiences, undoubtedly the result of meditation, were convictions of indubitable contact with Reality; experiences beyond the slightest cavil. For one thing, the vision of J ehovah by, Moses; the long Iine of Prophets-e-Isaieh's vision of God whose train: filled the universe, the ecstasy of Ezekiel lifted from .off hi~feet by the Spirit and removed from one place to another, the in- spiration of Baal Shem. Tov and the foundation of the Chassidiseher Movement; . the very fact of prophecy itself- all these stand asa living vital testimony to this one state- ment. In. the. Talmud, too, there are dark hints as to the existence of a developed tradition of the\" Mercavah \", or the Divine Chariot seen in vision by Ezekiel. Since the world isa process of Emanation, an outgoing of Reality into its Otherness (to use an Hegelian expression), there must be a corresponding way up for man by way of this \" chariot \"-the vehicle or means by which he could be transported into the realms of the unseen. And the Zohar speaks of the \"divine kiss\", during which the man is united with his Root. It elaborates at great length on the verse in Canticles: \"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth \", havingreference to the union of the letters of Tetragrammaton. I must quote, furthermore, the follow- ing: \"In the most mysterious and elevated part of the heaven there is a certain palace which is called the Palace of Love, wherein are hidden profound mysteries, and the Kisses of the King's Love are there. • •• There the Holy One, Praised be He, meets the Holy Soul (Nesehamah). He advances and immediately kisses her, and embraces her and caresses her ..•. Like the custom of a father to his beloved daughter.In kissing her, embracing her, and giving"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"138 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LADDER 139 her presents, so the Holy One, Blessed be He, does to the pure Soul daily\" (ii, 97a). (In order to prevent the acquisition of wrong impressions it is necessary to warn the reader, when examining original Qabalistic texts, against archaisms and erotic forms of expression. With the rationale here extended no difficulty should be experienced in piercing the conventional forms of writing, and obtaining true understanding.) At this juncture, however, we will deal with Meditation in its Hindu form as Yoga, since that system has been very elaborately detailed; and consider meditation as a general formula, leaving its particular divisions for discussion in connection with the Grades attributed to the ten Sephiros. Patanjali, in the first sentence of his Aphorisms, defines meditation as \"the hindering of the modifications of the thinking principle\". It is astounding that so simple a statement of fact should have been misconstrued for cen- turies, being obscured by religious doctrinalia and ethical sentimentalism. Ethics has but little to do with this ques- tion other than this: that the practitioner must so live while in training that no emotion or passion disturbs the Ruach which he is endeavouring to control. The Buach, the principle whose thought modifications are to be controlled, permitting N eschamah to pierce through the tranquillity thus caused, is not, as we have already pointed out, the highest power in man. It is only one particular function, one instrument of the Yechidah, by which it thinks, works, and experiences. As Blavatsky wrote in The Voice oj the Silence: \"The Mind is the great Slayer of the Real. Let the disciple slay the Slayer.\" The theory here is that the mind is but a mechanism for dealing symbolically with impressions, though its construction tempts one to take these impressions for Reality. Conscious thought, hence, is fundamentally false, preventing one from perceiving reality. There is but one simple fundamental essential to medita- tion, beyond all dogma and morality, viz. to stop thinking. This explanation of the major step leading to the Mystic experience is highly significant. It explains prayer, and its purpose; and all the several practices are seen to be simply \" dodges \", as it were, to acquire the faculty of slowing down the current of thought and ultimately stopping it altogether at will. The Hindu image expresses the theory perfectly. There is a lake into which five glaciers move- the five senses; the lake being the mind. While ice, the manifold impressions, is breaking off constantly into the lake the waters are troubled. Once the glaciers are stopped the surface becomes calm, and then and then only can it reflect unbroken the disk ofthe \" Son \"-the Augreides, the self-glittering One. While it is true that in sleep thought is stilled, the per- ceiving function, too, is stilled; and since we are desirous of obtaining a perfect vigilance and attention, uninter- rupted by the rise of thoughts, we follow this procedure. It is considered a necessary preliminary to still the con- sciousness of the body by a. practice called Asana-posture, by which, when some slight degree of skill has been attained, no messages of bodily disturbance are sent to the brain. It has been noticed that the breathing of persons in ecstasy becomes deranged in a marked and curious manner; the process, for one thing, becoming very slow and rhythmic. Yoga in its scientific way reversed the process, and its devotees attempted to reproduce, by breathing slowly, deeply, and forcefully certain aspects of the mystic states. One may profitably confirm this theory in the Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola. By this exercise some thoughts are barred altogether from forcing entry into consciousness, and those which do come into the mind do so more slowly than before, giving the practitioner sufficient time to per- ceive their falsity and consequently destroy them. In short, there is undoubtedly a real connection between the rate of respiration and the condition of the brain or the state of mind, as even a little experimentation will go to prove. The emotions are then stilled to prevent them also from arising to excite the mind we are trying to make quiet. In Pratyahara, we analyse the mind more deeply. It is a sort of general examination of the contents of the mind, and it is said that in Pratyaharic introspection one per- ceives directly the arguments underlying the Berkeleyan idealism. Following this, we begin to control and restrict thought"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"140 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LADDER 141 of whatever nature, and suppress all thoughts by a direct concentration upon a single thought which itself is finally banished. Fichtean philosophy has shown us that the contents of the mind at any moment consisted of two things: the Object or Non-Ego, which is variable, and the Subject or Ego, apparently invariable. Success in meditation pro- duces the result of making the object as invariable as the subject,this coming as a terrific shock, for a union takes place and the two become one. Rabbi Baer, the Chassidic successor of. Israel Baal Shem Tov, taught that when one becomes so absorbed in the contemplation of an object that the whole power of thought is concentrated upon the one point then the self becomes blended and unified with that point. This is the mystical Marriage so often referred to in occult literature, and concerning which so many extrava- gant symbols have been employed. 'I'his union has the effect of utterly overthrowing the whole normal balance of the mind, throwing all the poetic, emotional, and spiritual faculties into a sublime ecstasy, making at the same time the rest of life seem absolutely banal. It comes as a tre- mendous experience altogether indescribable even to those who are masters of language, remaining only as a wonder- ful memory-perfect in all its details. During this state all conditions of limitation such as time and space and thought are wholly abolished. It is impos- sible to explain the real implication of this fact; only repeated experience can furnish one with apprehension. For it is an experience beyond any adequate description; a pure termlessness where the subject no longer speaks of any thing; where both subject and object are transcended, and there remains only a sublime spiritual realization-an experience without a name. It is the most vivid of all experiences, for it is an absolute stunning blow to the mind, all other events of normal life being as complete darkness in comparison with it. The man who has experienced the more intense forms of this state of consciousness is completely liberated. The universe with its bonds is destroyed for him and he for it,and his will is thus able to proceed unhampered. Now Magick or the Practical Qabalah has, as its aim, the attainment of a similar state of consciousness, though its approach is from a different angle. Just as there are various technical methods of Yoga, so there are of Magick. I ignore completely, at this stage of exegesis, the charms and amulets which comprisea greater part of such Qabal- istic works as Sepher Ratsiel haMalochand The Greater Key of King Solomon. My references are in the main directed towards the spiritual thaumaturgy manifested in, for example, The Sacred Magic of Abramelin. the Mage and such invocations as\" The Hornless One\", \" Liber Israfel \"; the latter being an adaptation from the Book of the Dead; and the powerful fragments of lyrical ritual found in the Dee manuscripts. When a man endeavours to perfect his meditation, the rebellion of the human will and the Ruacl~ is violent, and only- by experience can one discover the almost diabolical ingenuity of the mind in attempting to escape from control. There are methods of training that will,by which it is more or less easy to check one's progress. Ma.gical ritual is a mnemonic process devoted to this end. I say mnemonic advisedly, to answer objections to \"apparatus\" employed by the Practical Qabalist. By each act, word, and thought, the one object of the ceremony-the Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel....,-is being constantly indicated. Every fumigation, invocation, banishing and circumambulation is simply a reminder of the single purpose until-after symbol upon symbol, emotion after emotion having been added-the supreme moment arrives, and every nerve of the body, every force-channel of the Nephesch and Ruach is strained in one overwhelming orgasm, one ecstatic rush of the Will and Soul in the pre- determined direction. . Everything in the operation is so arranged that it will remind the Magician of his one Aim, his one. True Object. He resolves that every weapon and instrument employed in his ceremony shall serve to remind him of his chosen end, making every impression (by means of the Qabalistic alpha- bet of association of ideas) the starting-point of a connected series of thoughts ending in that thing. His whole energy is resolved that every act shall turn to the advantage of his invocations. In a Temple which typifies the universe as he is aware of it, he draws a circle to announce the nature of his operation."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE MAGICAL WEAPONS the same goal as does the mystic. The latter works by the undermining of his rational consciousness, as it were, by the destruction of duality; whereas the rider of the magical chariot proceeds to add idea to idea, ecstasy to ecstasy, until the mind, unable to contain itself, overflows its limitations and in an overwhelming orgasm of bliss unites itself to That which hath no name. The Qabalists suggest reflection on the nature of the symbolism of the magical weapons. There is, of course, the Freudian one, and much of real value can be derived from such an interpretation. I have little sympathy, however, with those shallow intellects who would decry religion and particularly magick on the ground that it is solely sexual. One's only answer in such an instance can be to demand a definition of what is meant by so gross an absurdity. It is true, for example, that the Creative Will is symbolized by the wand, and that the wand itself may be represented by the phallus.

And, in any event, its significance suggests forces and powers which, like the commotion in the past concern- ing the Unconscious and the present widespread interest in glands and the effects of glandular secretions on the person- ality and consciousness, represent realities which definitely are not merely physiological. It is this fact which the reader must ever bear in mind. 'In connection with theurgieal practice and ceremonial generally, having little concern for goetic obscurations, there is a remark or two in Mr. Waite's Studies in .J.11.ysticism which are not a little profound, and are worthy of quotation in this place. \" Those who are acquainted with the spiritual processes followed by the old mystics will know that these processes are delineated . . . in the ceremonies of the great initia- tions, and though notwithstanding they offer . . • only the substitutes of things that are incommunicable on the dramatic side of the mystery • . . there is a condition induced in the candidate by which, if he is otherwise pre- f I . \" pared,he may enter the sphere 0 a rea experience. From another viewpoint, the magician resolves to put himself into harmony with the cosmos, which he deifies. The Sun is to him, as we have already observed, a spiritual principle, a God; the Moon another; the planets yet other Forces with which he is vitally connected, and he realizes that the rhythm of the cosmos is something from which he cannot and must not escape, without bitterly impoverish- ing his existence. His aim is to unite himself to these spiritual potencies. The hierophant of old time-in the rituals-would say to the Neophyte l \"There is no part of me that is not of the gods\". The early Christians endeavoured to kill this spirit, that of the old pagan celebration of spiritual ritual, and to some extent they succeeded. The Church frowned upon all things pagan or occult, and killed the worship of the planets and the zodiac, perhaps because astrology even then had become debased to mere fortune-telling. It was their intention to eliminate the astronomical festivals of the year, but only instituted others in their places. Then came the schism when division disrupted the former unity of the Church, and Protestantism dealt a death blow to this religious and ritualistic rhythm of the year in human life. Noncon- formity, with skill, put the finishing touches to the abysmal crime. Now, to demonstrate the grandeur of modern pro- gress, we have a poor, miserable, disconnected populace with nothing but American films, politics, and empty vacations to satisfy the ever-present human need of living in harmony with the universal spiritual forces underlying nature and all phenomena. . The Initiates, realizing that man had never lived not by bread alone but in the consciousness of the ever-living Gods, and by the spirit-of the SunandMoon and Earth in their revolutions, restored in secret the sacred days and feasts, almost as the Greek pagans had them, with the sunrise, noon, sunset.: and midnight pauses for worship-the four great daily stations of the Sun. Then the ancient cycle of Easter, with the crucifixion or conception of the Solar God; then Pentecost, and nine months later Christmas, his re- birth. For centuries prior to the Christian era nations had lived in this cosmic rhythm under the guidance of their Priest-King-Adepts. To these rituals we are warned it is wise to return, for the truth is, if it must be told, we are perishing from our soul outwards for the lack of fulfilment of our greater needs. ·We are cut off from the perennial sources of our inward nourishment and life; sources flowing eternally in thc universe. Vitally the human race would seem to be dying; and to the disintegrating body of humanity even the uni- verse would appear to be dead. As the late D. H. Lawrence so eloquently wrote: U • Knowledge' has killed the sun, making it a ball of gas, w~th spots; • knowledge' has killed the moon, it is a dead little earth fretted with extinct craters as with smallpox; the machine has killed the earth for us, making it a surface, more or less bumpy, that you travel over.\" Mr. Lawrence proceeds to state that all this means a return to ancient forms, if we would bring mankind face to face once more with spiritual reality. But we first must create these forms again. We must evolve them to conform to our present-day needs. How are we to revive the universe ·to pulsating vibrant life? How out of all this are we to get back the grand orbs of the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"146 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LADDER 147 soul's heaven which should fill us with inexpressible happi- ness? How are we to get back, for return we must, to Apollo, Demeter and Persephone or their equivalents? To the worship of Bacchus, Dionysius, the ecstatic forces of eternal nature and life, and the Rites of Eleusis? This is our problem, and it is a terrific problem which some day must be faced and solved. . We must get them back, for therein resides our Soul, which is our greater consciousness. That fact we feel- we know. The inert world of cold reason with its dead bit of moon above us; the sun so much burning gas-this is dry and sterile-a world of dry, sterile intellectuality. When we know the world as conjoined with ourselves; when we know the black earth as the womb and the symbol of Nuit-our Lady of the Starry Heavens, our mother of delight; the beautiful glistening moon, giving us our body as a sylphan joy to us, or to steal it softly away-for she is the emblem of continual change and Artemis the celestial huntress; when we know that great golden lion god, Ra- Hoor-Khuit bestowing on us his warmth and nourishment, or else, like a red angry lion, confronting us with gleaming open jaws, then we may realize that the universe is a living organism of which we are an integral part. \"Who could not feel the spiritual regeneration surge up within him and be silently thrilled when, in the early hours of a bright morning, the great glowing golden disk of the Sun lifts itself majestically over the misty purple banks of vibrating cloud-forms in the distant horizon, and one lifts up one's arms in ecstatic joy to the golden dawn in a mighty gesture of glorification, of blissful praise: .. Hail unto Thee who art Ra in thy rising, even unto Thee who art Ra in thy Strength, who travellest over. the heavens in thy bark at the uprising of the Sun. \" Tahuti standeth in his splendour at the prow, and Ra- Hoor abideth at the helm. Hail unto Thee from the abodes of Night.\" To this we must return, say the Qabalists; to a dynamic living conception of the cosmos. And the way is through daily ritual. Our reawakening by the invocation of the Gods to never-ending manifestation as living presences within our own hearts, souls, and in our own bodies. Such is the conception of the Practical Qabalah. Briefly, to resume its purpose, the Qabalists claim that Magick is useful to produce Trance-in the real sense of the word, a \"passing beyond \"-and Ecstasy, because it provides an excellent training for the mind, and the development of the Will preparatory to, or in conjunction with, meditation. It exalts the soul as no other method can to the impersonal and divine sublimity beyond the Abyss which is the pre- cursor of success in Union. It enlarges the scope of the mind, too, removing arbitrary limitations, giving it mastery of every subtle plane of Nature, affording adequate material for the ecstatic consummation of the\" divine kiss \", or the hiedabekue, as the Chassidim term it. There are some who, while fully alive to the advantages of the mystical state and to the manifold benefits which it confers, are appalled or frightened by what appear to them to be dangers in its development. That these processes lead to self-hypnosis is altogether fallacious; its proponents go entirely too far without medical evidence of a large number of cases under observa- tion. There is also the criticism of epilepsy, hallucination, and madness. Figs cannot come from thistles, nor can organization and moral capacity spring from disorganiza- tion I If the mystical experience-with its consequent enlargement of the universe and its enhancing of the entire character and sanity of a man, its power to bequeath knowledge-is the result of abnormal psychoses and disease, then we must change once and for all our ideas of what is morbid and what is sound. 'We must have a com- plete transvaluation of all existent values. If such men as Krishna, Buddha, and Plato, and a vast host of equal and le~ser names, owed their power to self-hypnosis and epilepsy, then indeed we have here formed the most power- ful argument for the cultivation of epilepsy. These are the keys which, in this world, will unlock the fast-closed doors of its mystery. But enough! These objections arise out of a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the experience, and of the methods leading thereto.

W. N. Sullivan, the mathematician and exponent of popular scientific prin- ciples, wrote in The Daily Express what appears to be, on the part of non-mystical writers and thinkers of to-day, a growing realization of the 'value of the experience which I have been labouring to explain. He writes: \"I do not believe that mysticism iss mere mental aberration. \" I am inclined to believe that the human consciousness is a developing thing, and that the mystical consciousness represents a higher stage than we have reached.\" The experience, whether obtained by meditation or Magiel<:, is marked by the emergence of an entirely new type of consciousness not differentiated into a subject- object state, for these have been fused into an undivided .' One. Whatever is seen, heard, or felt, in these moments is \" flooded with an inrush from the depths of the inner man. Deep-lying powers which are not ordinarily put into play THE LADDER 149 seem suddenly liberated, and the usual insulations which sunder and restrict our inner, life into separate compart- ments seem shot through.

In reaJity, that does not belong to the province that I or~gmally contemplated illustrating within the pages of thIS book, alth9ugh it can be simply and briefly demon- st~ate~ that the experience even here is capable of analysis, bemglIl,ducedby an unconscious application of the funda- mental principles laid down above...

In the second case, the same landscape or the manifold sensations of dark secret woods with the impression of the convocations of the hosts of the mighty, the singing streams and rivulets, and the carefree chirping of birds aloft in the empyrean-all these are like the mnemonic basis of Ritual, creating of necessity what we may term a Magical effect. That is, they overwhelm the recipient mind in boundless ecstasy of delight and joy, and the individual Ruach transcends temporarily its inhibiting barriers of custom, taboo, and restriction, and wings its way towards its Tsureh above the barren desert Abyss; or else it falls into a sublime union with the Soul of Universal Nature. Further comparisons cannot be undertaken now, but an example of the type of Nature-experience referred to may advantageously be given in a rather lengthy quotation from Miss Clare Cameron's splendid work, Green Fields of England: \" Good the long hours of sun-drenched silence, wherein through the wide-flung doors of the spirit crept in the crystal light and the sea's low music, to dwell there long after the doors were shut again. Full length in the sand or diving under the water, Being was ecstasy. There was an intense consciousness of youth which one knows not in towns, lusty and happy youth which is made of the Sun's ardour and the sea's rhythm ...• One's body there in the sand was a vessel to hold them all, a precious and God-given chalice tense with love and pity, that dared not move lest the magical wine be spilled and the spell be broken. • . • I thought I had never been so happy, that I had drunk of the wine of the gods rather than the common elements of earth, perceiving faintly that they might be one and the same. . • • For hidden in them and yet revealed was that secret Beauty that burns at the heart of all lovely and vital things, which is at once sword and balm, the Talisman of Truth and the Bread of Life. \". • • watched the eager earth responding to the ardour of the sky.

Tender sky and intoxicating kisses of air. My gods, my lov~rs, my friends. By day it was enough to be with them, their playmate, the glad confederate, their privileged listener to secrets never quite revealed, to wisdom never wholly understood; one with them, strong young hands in theirs, strong young feet racing beside, the same joy in the heart and ardour in the blood, the same unutterable love of life r But at night in the cool scented darkness, before the land became bewitched beneath the blue moon of the Fens, a restlessness came out of the air and invaded the senses, that neither talking nor walking, nor reading nor laughter would appease. As though the pipes of Pan rang still, thin, and sweet and with a music more alluring, for all its minor key, than any heard in sunlight. As though the games and delights of day with the invisible companions were not enough, but at night led further on to territories yet unknown, where mortal sense could not follow. . • • Not forbidden territories, but secret, lost, and hid from the coarser human understanding.

An inexpressible peace went back with me after that idle wandering, for the spirit of the water had paced the sands beside me, in silent rhythm of feet and heart, a spirit that had entered mine and brought unutter- able joy and fullness and grave content, and went with me up the sandy path and the crooked stairs, and to the vast kingdoms of sleep, ••. \" The methods adopted by the Qabalah extend to the world a new science, providing an enormous field of investigation for all who care to undertake it. The man of science will discover unclassified phenomena to record and analyse. To the philosopher new states of consciousness will be dis- closed; states which, because of the very patli he has been pursuing, have hitherto been barred from his examination. From the psychological point of view, the following are true of the experience under discussion: 1. The results are entirely illogical, from our ordinary point of view, but they give a unique form of knowledge which nothing else will give."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"2. The mystical states of all men, of different ages, exhibit an extraordinary similarity. 3. It is related to something which represents Reality. 4. The experience produces clear-cut results-geni«8. The experience produces art and genius in every field of endeavour, because therein all forms seem to speak, and there is gained an immediate intuition of form. One becomes a close and willing observer of Life itself rather than of the externals used by life, and from the Beatific Vision one reads the meaning of existence, and by these pictures one trains oneself for life and its appreciation in expression as genius. The psychological and spiritual phenomena of Medita- tion and Magick, as a whole, need to be analysed scientific- ally from a purely analytical viewpoint, and the conditions -leading up to the mystical experience, quite apart from the more or less wild and hazy vagaries of sectarian emotional mystics-accurately observed. This is what some few sincere people require. By advocating a scientific method applied to these methods and results, it is intended to make Qabalistic researches as systematic and scientific as Physics, to redeem it from ill- favour and make it an object of respect to those whose minds and integrity make them most in need of its benefits and most fit to obtain them. It is this which is the urgent necessity. By appropriating certain ancient ideas, and attributing them to our classification, revising them to suit modern conceptions and requirements, I suggest that we have an ideal battery with which to assail the strongholds of the fortresses between us and the attainment of Truth. From the Rosicrucians (without entering into a polemical discussion as to whether there is at present a genuine organ- ization in direct descent from the parent Source) we inherit a system of grades, which we may tabulate in the following manner: A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES The degree numbers, such as 3° =80, imply an operation in which the equilibration of Saturn and Mercury is con- cerned. It is also to remind one that if despondent, for example, three main limbs of the great Tree of Life have been climbed; if egotistical and proud, that eight more rungs of tantamount importance have yet to be ascended, and that most of the difficulties lie unconquered. All in all, the number harmonizes the conception of work already done with advantages yet to be gained. Let us now look at this system and see wherein our description of the Paths of Magick and Meditation connects with the Tree of Life, keeping in the back of our minds all the time the attributions and the meaning given to each Sephirah, The student is considered to be in Malkus, after having passed through a Probationary period during which he has familiarized himself with the various techniques to be used in his next grade. As a Neophyte, his particular task is to obtain complete control of what is termed the Astral Plane, proceeding to Yesod by means of the thirty-second Path of Tav. It will be helpful to consult the chart of the Tree of Life, on page 19, to facilitate explanations. The idea of an astral body will not be altogether foreign to the reader who has understood the propositions of the chapter entitled Adam Kadmon: This body must be completely formu- lared, strengthened and purified, until it can function independently of the physical body, as a bright, glittering, and clear-cut organism, well able to deal with the phantoms of that plane. He is examined in his ability to see clearly and accurately on this plane by interpreting, in a vision, a symbol absolutely unknown and unintelligible to him. It must be described ina manner so precise, as if he had read concerning it in the book from which it was chosen. It is the task, also, at this time to construct a Pantacle 153 THE LADDER Adeptus Major 6°=5°. Adeptus Minor 5° =60. Philosophus 4° =70. Practicus 3° =8°. Zelator 2° =90. Neophyte 1°=10°. 5.

Upon his ascension to the grade of Zelator, he must apply himself to the first stages of Yoga, that is Asana and Pranayama. He must choose a position in which to medi- tate, and so master it that he can remain absolutely still for long periods of time, his success being gauged by poising on his head a cup filled to the brim with water, of which not one drop must be spilt. InPranayama, he must discover precisely what effect various rates and rnodes of breathing have on the Founda- tions of his being. The grade of Zelator, it will be remem- bered, is attributed to Yesod, the Foundation. The magical side of the task in this grade is to forge a mighty magical sword of steel (representative of the analy- tical critical faculty of his Ruach) wherewith the student must be prepared to hew down without a moment's notice those blind forces which stand before him barring his pro- gress to the goal which he now envisages . As aPracticus (situate in Hod, the Sphere of ~,its god being Mercury) he is expected to complete his intellectual training. Philosophy and Metaphysics are the means to accomplish this task, and in particular, the Holy Qabalah, which he is expected to master before being able to go for- ward. He must discover for himself the properties of a number never previously examined by him, and in answer to intellectual questions he must display no less mastery of his subject than if he were entered in the final examina- tion for a Doctor of Science or Philosophy. Here, too, he is expected to make his magical Cup which is to represent Neschamah, his Understanding and In- tuition; and engage in, and obtain mastery over, the magical rites of Evocation. The results of the Evocation /~hould be unmistakably perceptible to the physical eye. Just as a thick cloud of heavy gas is normally visible, in like manner, at the very least, should the Practicus render visible the Spirit summoned in his magical rite. As a Philosophus he enters the sphere of Venus, here to learn to control properly his emotional nature, to com- plete his moral training, and to develop his devotion. He is to choose a certain idea or a god, and devote himself"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"156 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES heart and soul to its worship until it blossoms within his own heart. He must look upon this ideal in various ways, as his Master, his Friend, his Parent, his Beloved, or himself as the Priest of his God. This is Bhakta Yoga, union by the Path of Devotion. In the first instance, he gives up all consideration of per- sonal comfort and reward for His sake; and in the second case, looks upon his chosen God as his dearest friend, feel- ing no constraint in His presence. There is no trace of awe in his love, for he looks upon himself as the child of his God, from whom he no longer keeps at a respectful distance, or approaches with a timid heart. As a sweetheart, to the Philosophus the very idea of separation will imply the great- est misery, despondency, and heartache. He then considers himself as the High Priest of his God, beseeching Him to appear in answer to the prayers and invocations offered, seeking to establish a devotion similar to that of St. Francis of Assisi for Christ, and Abdullah Haji Shiraz for Allah. The fashioning of his Wand is also necessary at this juncture. The wand is the symbol for the Magical Will, which he is developing into a mighty potential, capable of making changes by a mere gesture. These four. grades which precede Tipharas and the con- summation of the tasks related thereto, may be said to be the equivalent of the Hebrew laudatory title-Chassid. He now approaches the greatest crisis of his career. Having acquainted himself with all technical methods of magick and meditation, and become expert in the handling of all these weapons, he must harmonize them (since his grade is in Tipharas-Harmony) and use. them as his experience and instinct dictate to perform the central operation of all Mysticism and Magick-e-the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel; the discovery of his True Will, and the ascertaining of the heavenly orb which he as a Star must follow. This is the essential work of every man; none other ranks with it either for personal progress, or the ability to help one's fellow-man, or to solve the problems of existence. This crisis, and one other yet to be described, is a necessary feature in his mystical career, one which is an absolute essential to his Quest. 'fHE LADDER 157 . To write of the gr~des abov.e5° =6 0 becomes increasingly difficult because, without bemg an Adeptus Minor himself, the reader has no means at all of understanding what the Adept considers a necessary task, since his viewpoint differs enormously from that of the ordinary learned man. Never- theless, the little that has filtered out from the Sanctuary, and come down from tradition, may as well be stated here. To become an Adeptus Major (in the Sphere of Geburah- Power) the Adept busies himself with the investigation of every branch and formula of practical Magick, and acquires what are known as the Siddhis or magical powers. He then advances to the grade of 7° =4°, the Adeptus Exemptus. His task is to discover what he is, whence he has come, why he is here on this particular planet and no other, and where his destiny will carry him. This is performed by the cultivation of the memory of his past incarnations. He is, conf~onted bY,a hideous hunchba:ck (?), mockingly facing him with an uplifted club. There IS no atom in his nature which can be displaced without altering him in some way; no useless moment in his past. What, then, is his future? The Adept has literary capacity, or, perhaps, skill in several languages ; can paint somewhat, and has a know- ledge of chemistry? How do these attainments help his purpose, or that of mankind whom he has sworn to help? He was killed as a snake in eeons gone by; stoned under Mosaic law; murdered when an infant by Herod; how do such memories help him ? His task, hence, is to resolve these abstruse questions ~n~ unti~ he .has thoroughly mastered the reason for ever; incident m hIS past, and found a purpose for every item of his present equipment, he cannot go forward. Having done so, he prepares a thesis setting forth his knowledge of the universe. It is said that such works as jthose of Paracelsus, Robert Fludd, Newton, Berkeley, Swedenborg, and Levi's Clef des Grand Mysteres are excellent examples of the required type of thesis. He should be a complete master of every aspect of Yoga, having experienced and thoroughly investigated the nature of Samadhi, which he is obliged to consider as the only state of consciousness wherein to explore the nature of the Universe."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"158 A GARDEN OF POMEGRANATES THE LADDER 159 These three grades of Adeptship are different degrees of Saintship, and the Adept of to-day is the equivalent of the Qabalist who in days gone by would have been known as a Tsaddik, or Saint. To attain to the next Grade of Magister Templi (Binah- the Sphere of Saturn, which is Time, the great Reaper and Death), he must decide upon the secondandmajor critical operation of his career-the crossing of the Abyss, and the destruction of his separate ego. The necessity for this arises from a realization that he cannot remain an Adept for ever, being hurled on by the irresistible momentum of his own inner nature. The essential attainment consists in the absolute annihilation of the bonds of the Ruach limiting and repressing Yechidah. This is the paradox of the Path. After incredible difficulties and struggles to perfect himself (Ruach-the ego centred in Tipharas) in every possible and conceivable way-he must get rid of it entirely in the end when it comes to the point of surrendering the self to the SELF. The paradox, too, is that in BinahTruth is obtained, but alas, there is now no separate personal entity to enjoy that Truth. The Adept that was, the separate Ruach, the glorious and developed personality, has been forever dis- solved into that ineffable Great Sea, the Nirvanic Pleroma of the Mother-the Celestial City, the City of the Pyramids under the Night of Pan. As a self-conscious entity he has merged all that made him such into the universal stream of consciousness, and identified himself with the divine Shechinah, that inner existence of grace common to the totality of mankind. Or, as other mystics would say, he has poured forth. his every drop of blood into the golden Chalice of our Lady Babalon, who is Shechinah, the Divine Presence in Binah, and, when that life has mingled with the life of every individual, all that remains of him is but a little pyramid of dust, treasured in the Urn of Hermes. Yet it is not, to continue to use paradox, so much self- destruction as a return to the underlying Reality. It is a. destruction ofthe paralysing bonds of Ruach, but it reveals that fundamental Life which forms and permeates the whole of manifestation. At the same time individuality is retained-jubilantly retained, as is shown when Blavatsky wrote in The Voice of the Silence: \"Joy unto ye, 0 men of Myalba. A Pilgrim hath returned back from ' the other shore '. A New Arhan is born.\" What is actually destroyed is simply the unconscious illusion of the separate self and the restrictions which that iIlusion formerly imposed upon the blazing Star or Monad within. It is but the shifting of the Point-of- View from that which has no real Life of its own to a new and nobler centre of re-integration which is vital, real, and eternal. It is no mere intellectual change of viewpoint, however. It is infinitely more than a rational decision to integrate oneself to a higher level of consciousness and to see that level in all things, for the change has been entirely due to the shattering experience that the centre of gravity, so to speak, lies beyond the Abyss. The Great Work itself consists of a simple operation-this changing of viewpoint, the slaying of the slayer of Reality-the Mind. But through eeons of evolutionary effort towards the development of a highly complex organization and constitution through which to contact the \"external\" universe for the obtaining of experience, we are unable to realize this simplicity and accomplish this operation at the outset, and so are obliged to struggle painfully through these difficult tasks in order to obtain the right degree of simplicity and penetrate the veil, to find our SELVES, spiritual centres of force, Yechidos, radiant with life and purpose and divinity. Prof. Martin Bilber, in his splendid work on Jewish Mysticism, speaks of a greater type of Tsaddik whose ecstasies and spiritual intoxications have ceased. Why have they ceased? Because the beatification and ecstasy is continuous and does not proceed in the Buach, but in the Supernal Sephiros, where \"abide\" the Real Potencies and Spiritual elements of a man. Hence the )possessor of anyone of these three grades which appertain to the Inner College of Masters is styled a Tsaddik, but his Tsaddikship is on a much more noble and lofty spiritual plane. A more appropriate title, perhaps, is Baal Shem Tov-A Master of the Name Divine.
