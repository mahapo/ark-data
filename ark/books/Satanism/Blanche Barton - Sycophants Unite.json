[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"S Y C O P H AN T S UN IT E ! by Blanche Barton Â©1 995 I hate to write this article. I hate to have to addr ess these issues because they make me angry and I hate to be angry. And I especially hate to be angry wh en I have been purposely baited into being angry - forced to was te my precious adr enal output, drained of my psychic/creative force, and maneuvered into writing an article like this. But there is something going on right now in the Satanic community that must be addr essed, a phenomenon that must be cut out like the vile cancer that it is. Ou r supporters and advo cates must be prepared to recognize and battle our enemies, especially wh en they're wearing black robes. Bear with me and let's get this down on paper, out into the ethers and ritualized out of our systems so we can move on to real issues confronting us. In our general information packet we have a \" Satanic Bunco Sheet .\" You've all read it, but let me highlight a couple of pertinent points. Tip Number Four states: The most parasitic \"Satanic\" newsletters invar iably contain a liberal dose of LaVe y-baiting. Their editors' masochistic requirements are exercised as 'lively exchange.' Their mainstay is often the reprinting of any letter, pro or con, from anyone capable of grasping a writing implement or poking at a computer or typewriter key. When responding to such transparent tactics, it's our policy to preface rebuttals with two acknowledgements: A) \"I know you're a masochist and delight in hostile banter,\" and B) \"Anything I write or say to you will keep you going for another six months.\" Th e Satanic Bible advi ses to \"question all things\" - but it helps to be able to t h i n k , first.\" Further in the flyer, inquirers are war ned: All of the above are subject to bitch-fights, petty jealousies, and rivalries. They are safe have ns for small-minded people trying to play head gam es, preferring the protection of groups rather than really working to apply wh at Anton LaVe y wrote. There is a creeping pestilence of divisiveness weaving its way into our ranks that we must ruthlessly halt before it strangles us all. This divisiveness and contentiousness isn't perhaps apparent to the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"untrained eye, hence the need for this article. It takes the form of \"honest inquiry,\" \"challenging debate,\" and \"stimulating dialogue.\" It takes LaVe y's dictum of \"question all things,\" and uses it to justify stirring up useless and counterproductive intellectual turbulence, all for the good of the philosophy. Anyone wh o refuses to be drawn into these stimulating debates, or wh o has a kind or supportive thing to say about his philosophy's founder, Anton LaVe y, is quickly labeled a \"sycophant,\" a \"LaVe y fanatic,\" and \"overly adu latory.\" On e is, thereby, incapable of objective, independent thought and can be relegated to the role of empty-heade d, brainwas hed moron. There aren't many of these instigators of \"lively exchange\" yet, but one or two have wormed their way into the good graces of the Satanic network, leeching off of our growing above-ground system of newsletters and correspondents, yet snidely refusing to align themselves with our progenitor organization. Now that Satanism is becoming an alternative, the \"lot lice\" are sniffing around at way s to sneak in under the tent flap without putting themselves on the line. We must recognize their insidious techniques before they undermine us irreparably. They pride themselves on being \"unaffiliated,\" implying that \"affiliated\" forums, like Th e Black Flam e , are so contam inated with adm iration for Anton LaVe y that they might slant or censor serious debate such as the sort they encourage. Of course, they don't send courtesy copies of their insightful newsletters to the Church of Satan, as most Satanically-oriented editors do, or someone might recognize them for the vile Qu islings that they are. Many brashly depend on exposure in Th e Black Flam e to generate a mailing list, won't commit themselves as Church of Satan members, but challenge our policies in the innocent guise of stimulating debate. Recent articles in one or two of these newsletters have advo cated rape, bestiality, and incest as viable Satanic alternatives, as well as providing a forum for hashing out such burning issues as pedophilia and fascism. In doing this, they create conflicts wh ere none need exist, just for the sake of rhetorical gymnastics. I figured out such actions are wrong wh en I was a little kid; things like rape, pedophilia and bestiality are unacceptable in civilized society because they are harmful, disruptive, unjust and they hurt innocent creatures. End of discussion. Is that so hard to figure out? Don't we all know this already ? Of course we do. We're being baited and goade d into debating how many angels can dan ce on the head of a pin. As for the dan ger of fascism infiltrating the Satanic movement, wh at are we supposed to be? A bunch of kindergarten babies? Are we supposed to be such self-righteous prigs that we can't stand to see a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"swas tika? By accusing us of fascism, are we supposed to be distracted from the fact that we live in an extremely puritanical, fascistic society? From all reports, Church of Satan members have never been intimidat ed by swas tikas, or any other emotionally-charged symbol. Those wh o have worn both attest to the greater power of the Baphomet to scare and mystify viewers. We don't need school marms to hover over us with rulers to slap our little hands and say, \"naughty, naughty.\" It seems preposterous to me that such desktop critics think fascism can harm the movement, wh ereas their advo cating rape and incest can do us no end of good. On e popular posture is that of the \"intellectual\" Satanic alternative. It's an elementary debating technique used to create a false dichotomy - claiming your opponent is something he isn't (i.e. fascist, racist, chauvinistic, non-intellectuals), thereby showing you rself to be pure by contrast, and forcing your opponent into a defensive position. If an \"alternative\" Satanist boldly declares himself to be against animal sacrifices, Satanists wh o have r e a d Th e Satanic Bible are forced to debate this non-issue. Upon exam ination, the \"intellectual\" alternative might be draped in perplexing, spiritualistic language but it still advo cates the sam e Satanism you read in Th e Satanic Bible : indulgence, individualism, challenging the status quo, rewar d based on merit rather than race, and intelligence. Gee, how different that is from the LaVe yan nonsense. I am deeply offended by irresponsible, obfuscating mental masturbation. If this were the kind of thing going on in the Church of Satan in 1976, I never would've joined. It's distasteful and juvenile - like a toddl er wh o's just discovered he has a wee-we e and wan ts to play with it all the time. It doesn't reflect a finely-honed mind as some might think; on the contrary, it indicates someone wh o is intellectually insecure - the equivalent of the schoolyard bully wh o has to pick on other kids to show how tough he is, an intellectual bully wh o intimidat es and goads those wh o might be a bit insecure themselves. I enjoy the odd gam e of mental fencing as much as the next Satanist, but this line of \"exciting open discussions\" are an of fensive misapplication of logic and rhetoric wh ich should be recognized for wh at they are: shit-disturbing. Playing the Socratic gadf ly, stinging us all into clarifying these issues before our detractors use them against us, is supposed to create turbulence for our own good. Thanks but no thanks. Worse than a simple was te of time and brainpower, this kind of insidious undermining creates a ripple-effect of problems we all eventually have to clean up. Here's a hypothetical progression:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1) Mr. Q starts Darkness Vi sible , yet another Satanic newsletter. He's not a member of the Church of Satan, but he adve rtises in all the respected, openly-affiliating newsletters. He is seldom overtly critical of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVe y or Th e Black Flam e so loyal compatriots thinks he must be all right. 2) Mr. Q publishes adh erents' articles, and compliments others on their var ious projects. People see their nam es in print, bask in his praise, and figure he must be an exceedingly perceptive fellow. 3) Mr. Q pays for ads for Darkness Vi sible , not solely by subscription exchange, but by that time-honored inducement called \"money.\" To an enterprising editor/publisher of a fledgling Satanic newsletter with extremely limited funding, a paid adve rtisement can be a welcome insert, no matter how insulting its wording. 4) After a few issues, Mr. Q appoints himself supreme arbiter of Satanic philosophy, providing a forum for \"forms of Satanism\" wh ich might not meet the approval of the Church of Satan. What does Anton LaVe y know anyway ? He only created the philosophy. Why should his organization have any final word in defining the religion? 5) People wh o might be moderately interested in Satanism pick up a copy of Darkness Vi sible , see advo cacy of bestiality, and drop the wh ole idea as something they'd wan t nothing to do with. 6) Satanophobic groups get a hold of a copy of Darkness Vi sible advo cating bestiality, rape and incest and use it to confirm all of the Christian hysteria we've had to fight so hard to dispel. W e get to clean up the shit, we get flack at work, we get our children jeopardized and our cars egged, not Mr. unaffiliated, ethical-inquiry, wh at-wh o-me?. 7) Ou r most supportive, productive, stalwar t members get tired of being called \"sycophants,\" tired of being drawn into pointless interchanges, get tired of defending and justifying themselves and their chosen leade r, and quietly move on to less complicated, more productive advo cacies. 8) Members of our hierarchy begin to debate about how best to handle these psychic vam pires - wh ether it's better to make people awar e, publish a shit list of people to freeze out of the network, or wh ether it's better to shine a glaring light on them, allow them all the forum they can handle, thereby showing themselves for the slime they are. We are therefore divided. Ho w could an infiltrating Christian agent prov oc ateur bent on destroying the Satanic movement undermine it more efficiently?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The only reason I've gone into such detail concerning these methods is so that you'll be equipped to recognize such divisive maneuverings wh en you see them. So far, we've all done a pretty good job of weeding out this sort of contentiousness. But now, since the Satanic movement is gaining more steam than ever, we need to tighten our ranks. There is no room in the Church of Satan for hairsplitters and nitpickers. If you have a policy question, you can call or write to the Church of Satan and ask wh at the Church's stand on pedophilia or bestiality is (if you have n't read Th e Satanic Bible yet); we don't need BBS bickerings or pointless newsletter interchanges \"to ham mer these issues out.\" Go to the source and ask wh at Satanic policy is. Because Anton LaVe y wan ted his philosophy to be accessible to those without stultified minds, anyone can go into a bookstore, pick up a copy of Th e Satanic Bible , read, understand, and apply Satanism to better her life. As for group activities, newsletters and the like, the Church of Satan has maintained a laissez-faire policy over the past three decade s. Official membership isn't demanded, just simple acknowledgement of the source and accurate codification of LaVe yan principles. This in itself is Satanic, placing the responsibility for your own \"salvat ion\" and entertainment squarely on your own shoulders wh ere it belongs instead of on a \"Priest\" wh o'll talk to God for you or reveal the Great Mysteries - for a price. There will alway s be jealous, unethical, subversive, self-loathing, counterproductive, life-sucking parasites wh o will wan t to scave nge from our viable organization. They are shallow, without vision, and probably incapable of commitment or loyalty to anything or anyone. They will continue to use wh atever ploys they can to obfuscate, disable and defuse us. Don't be sway ed, flattered or ghettoized. The Satanic network is not the real world; our power lies in having an effect in the real world - Satan's true realm. Dare to be a big fish in a bigger pond - you have the power to do so. You're a Satanist, and can proudly declare, \"I have taken thy nam e as a part of myself...\" The Church of Satan was formed as a mutual adm iration society, not as an encounter group. We are energized by and supportive of each other. Of course there are going to be differences am ong us. Satan is representative of the reconciliation of apparent irreconcilables. We're driven individualists with our own obsessions and directions. On e of our greatest strengths is that we can't be neatly pigeonholed and dismissed. Anton LaVe y intended his organization to be a meeting of minds, wh ere a highly-evolved black man could stand forth in front of a Baphomet and curse his \"brothers\" for forcing him down to their level, and a wh ite man could stand beside him and curse his self-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"hating race wh o has undermined itself to the brink of extinction by perpetuating the lie of Christianity for 2,000 years. We can choose to concentrate on our differences, worry them and pick at them like scabs until they pus and infect, or we can concentrate on our similarities, our mutual goals, and our relief to be am ong others of like mind wh ere, as Milton wrote, \"Here at least we shall be free... though in Hell.\" Because Anton LaVe y has maintained the standar d of \"wh at you are inside is dictated by wh at you are outside,\" we have become more of a professional cabal than just another occultic circle-jerk. Like the Masons, we pass secret signs or mention certain nam es that open doors. When one says he's an affiliate of the Church of Satan to the right people, assumptions are made that he's a product-oriented, no- bullshit kind of person wh o'll get things done. To protect that status, we cannot allow those wh o will dilute our growing reputation to ride on our coattails, wh eedling their way into others' good graces at our expense. We are the only cohesive international movement on the horizon today . We have one book, one man, one organization to stand behind. That's more than the Wiccans can accomplish, or the Republicans, or the Democrats, or the Christians. We are invincible as an organization, as a movement - but not as feuding, factionalized splinter groups. For that kind of cohesion, we need a leade r. There have been countless psychological studies focusing on group dynam ics. On e person alway s emerges as the leade r, otherwise nothing gets done. Someone doesn't set himself up as leade r by posturing and preening; leade rs are appointed by those in wh om they engender loyalty, adm iration, trust, and confidence. On ly those wh o are secure in their own egos can unreservedly commit their allegiance to a man they respect. It's an unpopular stance these day s; read the newspaper. We're lucky to have a leade r like Anton LaVe y. He has ensured that his philosophy will not die with him; it has been and will continue to be codified, expanded and applied in new areas by his or ganization . The Church of Satan cannot be defined as a personality cult. We are not dependent on the personality of Anton LaVe y; the philosophy he established and still codifies will survive the centuries. But we do respect him and acknowledge him with unswerving loyalty - not blind faith, but educated adm iration. In these day s of electing our sacrifices and tabloid crucifixions, it's blasphemous to respect a leade r and not try to tear him down - almost as heretical as calling forth Lord Satan"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Himself. That kind of loyalty comes naturally to a true Satanist; it rankles those with a lingering Christian agenda. Ou r most productive people are \"LaVe y fanatics,\" those wh o say, \"Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. I'll throw in my lot with the ones wh o started it, wh o sustain it, and I'll do my part by applying Satanism in my own life towar d product and satisfaction.\" Sycophants are the ones wh o make it worthwh ile for Dr. LaVe y to continue writing, to keep recording his music. They encourage further productivity and let him know his perseverance isn't in vain. Anton LaVe y doesn't need to justify or defend himself to anyone; his strength and his talent justify him. He is a noble, creative man wh o remains steadf ast in his convictions. That's wh at his detractors can't stand. His words and his music only ring truer because of their efforts to defuse him. Sycophantic praise is more valuable to him than people wh o wan t to start their groups or their newsletters, \"all for the good of the Church.\" Start them, fine. But adm it unabashedly it's to feed you r ego and your pocket, not Dr. LaVe y's. Apply your enthusiasm towar d larger practical goals. Put taxation of churches on a ballot, invest your mind and money in the development of Artificial Hu man Companions, virtual reality, and total environments... do something. You are aligned with powerful forces - utilize them. W e are responsible for the Renaissance, the revolution, if there is to be any at all. We are the leade rs, not the gossips, critics and commentators. As we accelerate along this electronic superhighway , there are fewer artisans, more kibitzers and packagers feeding off the rare tidbit of creativity. Product has become more precious than gold. Don't get bogged down in networking and he- said/she-said accusations, spending so much time playing the gam e we lose sight of the objective. Exam ine m ot ives , not smokescreen \"issues.\" So the next time someone accuses you of being a \"sycophant,\" smile portentously, give a slight nod and know you've identified an enemy. Ou r detractors wan t to undermine your confidence, your principles, and our cohesion by throwing such words around. We have direction and focus. We cannot afford to have our energy siphoned off and sabotaged from within. We're out for bigger gam e. Don't fall for cheap ploys of the jealous and weak. Don't submit. Just say, \" N o . You're a scumbag, I don't like you, get away from me, you stink, I don't wan t to hear wh at you have to say, I'm not interested, you are not welcome here, go find another sucker.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"At this juncture, we cannot tolerate dissension, skeptical inquiry or inciting to mutiny. The stakes are too high. If this is to be called tyrannical, despotic and ruthless, so be it. Internal strife is our only significant enemy. Now you can recognize these agitators' sleight of hand, and their motives. We know wh o we are and they know wh o they are. Yes, it is an us-vs.-them world, even wh en they try to call themselves Satanists. And don't expect me to be drawn into further angry response wh en this article is dissected by \"honest inquirers.\" My ritual is complete. I have more important things to do - and so do you.
