[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"S a t a ni s m What is Satanism ? The Basic philosophy: Satanists don’t worship the Devil, that is the major prejudice behind Satanism. When people think of Satanism they usually think of the raping of young virgins, the ritually slaughtering of animals and the drinking of baby grease, this all combined in a sort of black mass. Well, unfortunately for those who seek sensation, but this image is far from being Satanic. Modern Satanism is not worshipping the Devil. A Satanist doesn’t worship the devil, or Satan. Satan is an invention of Christianity and a Satanist rejects Christianity. Someone who worships Satan is to be called a Devil worshipper, not a Satanist. You can’t spell Satanism without spelling “Satan” off course, but know that “Satan” is ancient Hebrew for “Opponent”. An opponent of the slavish worshipping of some kind of God, an opponent to the values that, through our nature, would be converted to frustration and psychological trauma. When there’s talking about this “Satan” in the modern satanic scene, it should be regarded symbolically. Satan as a symbol of Christian sins, man’s carnal nature, nature in its most incomprehensible, inscrutable ways. Anton Lavey (founder of the Church of Satan, the man behind it all) also says he called it Satanism because it is the most stimulating under a taboo like the word Satan. A Satanist is his own G od: A Satanist considers himself God, his own God that is. He’s responsible for everything he does. His life depends, for a great deal, on his attitude. If a Satanist would worship something, it would be only his plain self. Man is largely responsibly for the things he does, so he must face the consequences. Man controls his own life, he must make the decisions. Not god, but man should decide what he does, and carry responsibility for his acts. The Satanist is the most important person in his life. A Satanist rejects the belief in the existence of a Christian God, it’s never proven he should exist, and that proof will never face the earth, because it simply isn’t there. If there would be a divine power that would’ve created everything, this power would certainly be so impersonal that it couldn’t be comprehended by a mere mortal. This power would be of such an immense nature that it simply wouldn’t care about us, human beings. Too me, this power is nature, and nature is merciless. Maybe this force could be called God, but certainly not a God with the personality of that Christian God. Satanism wr ongly interpreted: The media often uses the word Satanism when there should be placed the word devil worshipping. It also occurs that we can read the paper about people, claiming to be Satanists, robbing graves and writing graffiti on other people’s property often using pentagrams and satanic slogans, while a Satanist considers respect as one of his major values. Another example of mentioning Satanism where there should be devil worshipping can be found in the dictionary. Satanism: worshipping of Satan, to spread blasphemy. The dictionary clearly states Satanism is the worshipping of the Devil, while Satanism has got nothing to do with this."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A Satanist’s scale of values A Satanist cherishes some values which he clearly stands for. These values are often spanned in some guidelines that, as a parody to Christianity, are formulated in sins, statements and rules. The nine satanic statements: The 9 statements declare what Satan is to us as a symbol. Each statement represents a certain value for the Satanist. 1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence: In many religions it has been a tradition to indulge from lust in order to get to higher grounds. Just take a look at Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and many more. But what people often forget is that we’re descendants from animals and yes, we still have our animal instincts inherited from those animals. All these instincts make people lusty for sex, good food, and plenty of other things we like to do. When some of are basic instincts get denied by us, it often results in frustration or even trauma which leads to worse. A beautiful example of frustration which leads to worse is that of a pedophile priest. When a person is too weak and denies its instincts, its frustration will out! Most of the time it will out in things that endanger other human beings. Those outings are often things like violence or sex. Other people (often innocent children) are mostly the victims of these outings of frustration. Because of that, people should preven t frustration and sometimes admit, indulge to his instincts. It never hurts to have a great party a few times or to enjoy a good bit of sex, to enjoy a good meal... To indulge to your instincts is a great form of stress relief. 2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams: This statement follows up the 2nd statement. People are often so busy with thinking about spiritual stuff like the afterlife and other. So people are often busy with trying to have a pure soul in order to get to heaven. But what if the afterlife doesn’t exist? I only know one thing for sure, this life is a certainty, not the previous or the next one or the afterlife. We know we live now, so we must make the best of it and not just throw our lives away to something that might not even exist! 3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit: Knowledge is power, and it’s great to know some things. Science is an area that’s constantly evolving and is extremely fascinating. It’s fun to investigate things yourself, to research, to test the truth in stead of just regarding the bible as the only truth Even now people are still quarrelling about the evolution theory, but should we believe in the words written in a 2000 year old book? Research, we have got 6 senses that can help us, we have minds, so use them. And if you don’t want to go to research, at least grab a book and read about it. But don’t believe everything, we must be critical individuals and we must only believe in what has sufficient proof. 4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates: Lots of people believe one should act according to the rule of “giving others what you want they should give you”. Satanism on the contrary acts upon “giving others what they give to you”. When living according to “giving others what you want they should give you” one will often find one self being deceived, lots of people tend to abuse the “goodness” of others. When living according to this principle, you could loose a lot, especially your belief in the goodness of mankind. A Satanist acts according to upon “giving others what they give to you”, this way one won’t loose a thing that could be gotten lost in a stream of abusers. This statement says one must put his attention and love in real friends, in stead of being abused by ingrates. 5. Satan represents vengeance in stead of turning the other cheek: What if vengeance goes back to your basic instinct self-preservation? Something did you harm, so you want to avoid this will ever happen again by making the other person feel how much harm he did to you. If you bottle up your frustration without tending to make a fight, without letting the other person know you don’t appreciate what he’s doing or without having a healthy vengeance, all pent-up rage will one day out. This pent-up rage often results in a situation leading to no good. Everything bottled up comes out at once sometimes even affecting those dear to you, affecting yourself. So, just like your instincts, it’s unhealthy to deprive of vengeance because this can also lead to frustration, or worse. 6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible in stead of concern for psychic vampires:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Some people just can’t handle responsibility, they always mess things up, they abuse your trust and they even are able to take you in to bad situations. These people should be avoided, these people shouldn’t be trusted, these people shouldn’t be given responsibility. Psychic vampires are persons that figuratively suck every bit of energy out of your soul. They make you feel responsible for their bad luck, make you feel guilty and through your compassion, often profit by your help. Are their certain persons you visit or keep in touch with, but only because you’d feel guilty if you don’t? Or do you see yourself often helping somebody that doesn’t ask but just hints? These persons are so called psychic vampires. Psychic vampires should be avoided, they only take advantage of you and the only thing you could possibly get in return is a bad feeling. 7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development” has become the most vicious animal of all: Darwin’s evolution theory shows us we once were, and probably still are, but animals. But because of our evolution, because of our “divine spiritual and intellectual development”, man will take care of apocalypse, the earth will be destroyed. Scientists say that within 50 years the earth will possibly be destroyed by man, always exploiting the earth. Now already man is using 120% of earths capacity, more than earth can regenerate. Evolution is turning into our doom. “Maybe” the earth and everything walking on it would be better of if we just stayed apes. 8. Satan represents all of the so called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental or emotional gratification: Example, the 7 deadly sins: greed, pride, envy, anger, gluttony, lust and sloth. Each of these sins leads to satisfaction, a feeling of self-complacency. Greed is nothing more than wanting to have more than you already have, nothing wrong with that I suppose. Envy means to look with favor upon someone else’s possessi ons, and to desire to obtain the same. Envy and greed are the 2 main powers behind ambition, and without ambition nothing could be accomplished. Gluttony is nothing more than eating more than necessary, is that so bad? Pride is cranking up your self-esteem, without something to be pride of man wouldn’t have any self-esteem. Sloth, everyone likes to stay in bed a little longer on those terrifying Monday-mornings, there isn’t a person that gets up every morning feeling well with it, we’d all like to be a bit...lazy. Lust is, together with self-preservation, one of the biggest basic instincts. Man strives after lusty experiences. Sex is fun, sex is good, so why would it be a sin? If it feels good, then why shouldn’t you do it? Anger is another deadly sin. When we are harmed by someone, our biggest basic instinct, self-preservation, operates to defend ourselves against injustice. It’s most probable because of our anger that the person harming you will take you into account. 9. Satan is the best friend the church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all those years: Almost every religion lives in a world divided in black and white. China has the yin and the yang, Christianity has its God and Satan. Every time something bad occurs, it has always been Satan’s fault. For centuries, priests gave Satan the blame for all “acts of evil”. People feared Satan, so they went to Church en masse to pray to God. The 9 Sins: The 9 sins are the things a Satanist detests, and therefore never commit either. The 9 sins need less of an explanation because they’re very down to earth. Some sins might need some explanation, but largely they give a perfect view on their meaning. 1. Stupidity 2. Pretentiousness 3. Solipsism 4. Self-deceit 5. Herd-conformity To conform to the herd is e.g. doing things because you know others will speak negative of you when you don’t do them. You must limit yourself in conforming to the herd, however this is sometimes impossible. You still can’t run naked down the street because you want it. 6. Lack of perspective Lack of perspective is short-sightedness, short-sighted people only see a small part of what truly is there, this leads to misinterpretation. 7. Forgetfulness of past orthodoxies When one has done something terribly wrong in the past, you must make sure that something that negative never happens again. When you forget those past orthodoxies, you’re bound to make the same mistakes over and over again. 8. Counterproductive pride Pride is good, but it mustn’t oppose your productivity. If you feel to pride to wash the dishes, then that’s Counterproductive pride. 9. Lack of aesthetics The physical application of the balance factor. One must know whether it’s too much, or too less. Aesthetical beauty is very important when performing lesser magic."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The 11 rules of the earth: A Satanist’s scale of values also consists of some personal rules. These are 11 very specific rules. 1. Do not give opinions or advice unless being asked for 2. Do not tell your problems to others unless you are sure they want to hear them 3. when in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there 4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy 5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal 6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved 7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained 8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself 9. Do not harm little children 10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food 11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him. Satanic magic and rituals What is satanic magic? According to Anton Lavey the definition of magic is: “The change in situations or events in accordance with one’s will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable”. This definition can be interpreted in different ways, looking at magic differently we can even use manipulative and psychological methods as well. But magic is never fully explicable in scientific ways, often science is regarded as magic too. So there are several categories and subcategories in the broad spectrum of satanic magic. First of all, there is lesser magic or manipulative magic, which is classified in sex, sentiment and wonder. Then we have what is called higher magic or ceremonial magic, which is categorized in destruction, compassion and lust. We’ll discuss these different kinds of magic later on in the essay. Another essential thing one needs to know about magic is that there is no difference between white and black magic, except for the hypocrisy of the so called white magician. White magic is said to be used for good, altruistic purposes. But doesn’t every one use magic to feel good after all? One couldn’t perform magic in the benefits of someone else if the magician him self would feel worse about it. Another argument could be that we don’t know what’s good or what is evil, to me, there is no universal good or evil, only personal. According to modern Satanism the powers of magic don’t originate from any source outside the person performing it. Lots of religions suppose magic doesn’t come from the individual but from some divine “exterior” power. A Satanist believes the magic comes from his inner self, he is his own god after all. Lesser or manipulative magic: Manipulative magic is, like the its name says, achieving your goal by means of manipulation. This may not seem like magic at first sight but if we take a look back at the definition of magic it fits well in with the other kinds of magic. What mustn’t be forgotten with this kind of magic is an appearance that fits in with the kind of manipulative magic one wants to perform. Manipulative magic is performed by one’s intellect."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Manipulative magic through sex: There are many examples of manipulative magic through sex, just think of the numerous girls unbuttoning a few more buttons of their blouse at an oral examination, pretty much the same when wearing a short skirt. Another example is the beautiful woman married to the old, ugly, but rich man. As you can see through the examples, a woman is the real champion in performing lesser magic. A man will most likely yield more easily to a beautiful woman than a woman would yield to an attractive man. Biologically speaking it is explainable to the large amount of testosterone floating through the veins of many male persons. Manipulative magic through sentiment: Sentiment can also be used by means of manipulative magic. Just think of children starting to cry when not getting the object they desire. Or think of that kind old lady that seems so vulnerable and fragile to most people, often getting help when not asked for. Manipulative magic through wonder: This form of manipulative magic is most effective through the fear it inspires its victims. The manipulative witch or magician looks very mysterious and non- conformist, this appearance makes people often afraid of the consequences that could follow when not granting a wish of the witch or magician. Higher of ceremonial magic: Next to lesser magic we can find the higher or ceremonial magic. Ceremonial magic is practiced during ritual, most of these rituals are performed individually. There are some rituals that are performed in groups like a black mass etc., but mostly these rituals don’t have any magical meaning and are just a symbol of the rejecting of God. An other vision on group rituals is the magic of the moment, performing something in a group of like-minded persons, you experience the full support each persons gives you and this can only strengthen the magic. Ceremonial magic isn’t performed through the mind, but through the feeling, emotions. It’s not a form of manipulating but the usage of your emotions to bend a situation into your advantage. Any one who has experienced emotions like hate or lust knows that these emotions are very powerful things and can make a beast out of the most civilized person. Ceremonial magic is categorized in lust, destruction and compassion. Personal ingredients used to perform satanic ritual: - Desire: Desire or motivation is the main ingredient, when not having enough motivation, your ritual is doomed to fail - Timing: When attacking a person through magic, the best moment to perform it, is when your victim’s the weakest. The best timing occurs when the victim is fast asleep, or (if the victim is a female) when she has her menstruation. -Imagery: Imagery is a welcome appliance, through imagery lots of emotions can be strengthened, Imagery gives the performing something to concentrate to, e.g. an imagined enemy in the ritual chamber can help you in focusing your energy into your goal. - Direction: Your power must be directed at something, when you’re asking yourself questions about the results of the ritual, that’s the sign you didn’t put much energy in it anyway. The goal of a ritual is to get loose from frustration, to take al these emotions out, while the one who’s still thinking about it after the ritual clearly didn’t free his emotions. - Balance: to guarantee the effectiveness all pre-mentioned ingredients must be balanced carefully and with thought. The ritual chamber: For the performing of a ritual one can use a lot of appliances, these appliances mostly have an esoteric meaning and mostly serve for creating a mysterious and magical atmosphere around you. The power comes from yourself, so you must create"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the right atmosphere for yourself to make this power come to its full expression. The appliances used during ritual can vary, but there are a few elements that often turn up in ritual: - An altar: This mustn’t be a real altar, a good table or desk can also serve as an altar. - At least one black candle and one white candle: The white candle is placed on the right side of the altar and is used as a symbol of the hypocrisy in mankind, on the left side of the altar, we have a black candle, representing the animal and natural in each man. A few black candles can serve as decoration for the ritual chamber - The Baphomet sign: The sign of Baphomet is an inverted pentagram with a goat’s skull in it. This sign usually decorates the west wall of the ritual chamber. - Black robes - A chalice used to take a draught from at the beginning of the ritual. - Alcohol to put into the chalice - A bell to ring at the beginning and the end of the ritual - A sword: A sword is used to invoke the 4 crown princes of hell: Satan, Lucifer, Belial and Leviathan. The sword’s also often used in destruction rituals to figuratively mutilate your victim. The lust ritual: The lust ritual is together with the compassion ritual on of the most personal rituals, the effectiveness is at his best when performed individually. Someone performing a lust ritual wants a certain person to have sex with him/her. Since ceremonial rituals are mostly about emotions, feelings, we associate lust with an orgasm. A lust ritual without an orgasm is hardly to be called a lust ritual. The compassion ritual: Someone performing a compassion ritual is someone who had to deal with bad luck in the past, and wants his fate to be more fortunate in the future. The feeling associated with compassion is sadness, so a compassion ritual will be most effective with the shedding of tears during the ritual. With each ritual the most extreme form of every emotion must out to make the ritual as effective as possible. The destruction ritual: The destruction ritual is used to destroy one’s enemies. The emotion associated with this ritual is anger. A destruction ritual needs something to direct the energy to, like a doll, a song, a poem or anything as that might serve thee well and may make the ritual more magical and mysterious. The Psychological background of a ritual: The earlier mentioned rituals mustn’t be looked at as solely spiritual things, a ritual’s often a good way to loose frustrations and out your feelings. After performing a destruction ritual most hate for that certain person can be cooled down a bit, maybe because you have cut him to pieces in your ritual... A compassion ritual can be very relieving, to have a good cry can serve man well. And the sexual frustration one had before performing a lust ritual might be worn of when having masturbated with that one special person in mind. Influential persons Anton Szandor Lavey (1930 – 1997): This is the person, the founder of modern Satanism and therefore is named the satanic pope by many. Anton Lavey had a remarkable life. When he was young, Lavey traveled with the circus as an organist, there he gained a lot of knowledge of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"human character. It’s also in the circus that Anton learned the art of taming lion, hypnotizing and a bit of conjuring. After the circus he had some other jobs like police photographer where he got to know man’s most dark side. Later on he studied a bit of criminology at the university and he founded “the magic circle” an occult group of like minded people. Just to show how non-conformist he was: Anton Lavey had a house with 13 rooms, in all these rooms the walls were painted black and the ceiling red. His house was crammed full of skulls, coffins, daggers, demonic statuettes en a plastic owl. Among his pets were some tarantulas and a lion he had to “create an exotic atmosphere in his house”. In 1966, walpurgisnacht, Anton Lavey founded the church of Satan, an historical day and also a festive day for many a Satanist. Anton Lavey was the author of “The Satanic bible”, “the devil’s notebook”, “the Satanic witch”, “the Satanic Rituals” and “the secret life of a Satanist”. Aleister Crowley (1875 – 1947): Aleister Crowley too is a very remarkable figure, he himself believed he was the reincarnation of some famous occultists. He also thought that he was, in one of his previous lives, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, an Egyptian priest from the 26th dynasty. He also called himself Baphomet, the symbol of Satan. Aleister Crowley himself wouldn’t approve of being called a Satanist, but his texts about magic and ritual are acknowledged by many Satanists. Aleister Crowley is a very influential person through his vision on magic, not through philosophy. When he was young Aleister lived together with his mother and father in a strict Christian sect, he later departed from. When Crowley grew older he began to realize he got turned up by descriptions of torture and blood. The rest of his life was a chain of awkward facts and magical groups to which he belonged. Aleister Crowley is the author of: ”the diary of a drug friend”, “Magick in theory & practise” and “the book of law”. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900): Nietzsche probably is the most normal person fitting in the group of influential"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"persons. Nietzsche influenced the writings of Anton Lavey, it’s obviously his philosophy that’s most influential too Satanism. Nietzsche was the son of a priest. His father died 6 months before his brother died. The death of those 2 meaningful persons didn’t stop Nietzsche from going to the finest schools and universities. When he was 21 years old he read “the world as Will and Representation” of Schopenhauer, this book influenced the rest of his life. Nietzsche wrote a lot of books mostly inspired by Schopenhauer and his favorite composer Wagner. Nietzsche wrote about 19 books. His most famous works are “Der Antichrist”, “Also sprach Zarathustra”, and “zur genealogie der Moral”. Some other influential persons: Sigmund Freud, Charles Robert Darwin, Eliphas Levi, Ayn Rand, Karl Gustav Jung and many others... Made by Walewein"}]
