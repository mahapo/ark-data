Much of the material in the monograph was laterexpanded into a series of twenty essays issued to Satanists as a study course.Both the original monograph and the essays derived from it were discontinuedprior to the 1970 publication of the Satanic Bible because of that volume’sincorporation of the essays in its “Books of Lucifer” and “Belial”. Thismonograph, then, may be considered the original manifesto of the Church ofSatan and hence its founding statement of principles.]The Nine Satanic Statements1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of lovewasted on ingrates!5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concernfor psychic vampires!7. Satan represents man as just another animal - sometimes better, moreoften worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his“divine spiritual and intellectual development”, has become the mostvicious animal of all!8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical,mental, or emotional gratification!9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as he has keptit in business all these years!Part I: ForewordIn writing this monograph it is our intent to give you a basicunderstanding of the Satanic religion. Therefore we have attempted topresent this to you in a form which will be easily understood.We fully realize that many of you who will read this booklet will not benovices to the basics of Satanism or the fundamentals of psychology whichmake up a large part of the Satanic philosophy.- 710 -We are aware that to many of you part of the information herein iselementary. Therefore it is to be understood that there is no attempt on ourpart to be condescending to those to whom some of this information isalready known.We realize, however, that probably many more of you knowcomparatively little about Satanism, except what little you have been able todecipher from the reams of ponderous material which is shrouded in somuch esoteric jargon as to make it virtually useless to neophytes in Satanictheology. It is with this in mind that we have avoided delving into the finerpoints of Satanic thought and ritual magic. A complete statement of thetenets of Satanism and an explanation of the ceremonies and detailedinstructions on same are available to our members.In the past the only writings on Satanism were those done by otherreligions as a means of propaganda to turn people against it, or byuninformed journalists who were influenced by the Judæo-Christiansociety surrounding them. Therefore the information contained in suchwritings was either completely false or sensationalized.Our purpose is to enlighten you as to the true concepts of Satanism andto refute the myths attached to it.The “seven deadly sins” of the Christian church are greed, pride, envy,anger, gluttony, lust, and sloth. Satanism advocates indulging in each ofthese “sins”, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.A Satanist feels there is nothing wrong with being greedy, as it only meansthat he wants more than he already has. Envy simply means to look withfavor upon the possessions of others and to be desirous of obtaining similarthings for oneself. Envy and greed are the motivating forces of ambition,and without ambition very little of any importance would be accomplished.Gluttony is simply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive.When you have overeaten to the point of obesity, you will oftentimes resortto another sin - pride - to regain an appearance which will return your self-respect. Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other thancovering his body and keeping off the elements is guilty of pride. You mayencounter scoffers who maintain that labels are not necessary. You mightfind it an ego-satisfying little exercise to point out to these people that oneor many articles that they are wearing are not necessary to keep themwarm. There is not a person on this earth who is completely devoid of allornamentation. You can inform the person that any ornamentation of hisbody shows that he too is guilty of pride. Regardless of how verbose he maybe in his intellectual description of how free he is, he is still wearing the- 711 -elements of pride. This thought may serve no other purpose for you thanthat of being a satisfying exercise in abuse of non-Satanists.Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth; and ifyou lie in bed long enough, you may find yourself indulging in yet anothersin - lust. To have the faintest stirring of sexual desire is to be guilty oflust.In order to ensure the propagation of humanity, nature made lust thesecond most powerful instinct, the first being self-preservation. Realizingthis, the Christian church made fornication the “original sin”. In this way itmade certain that no one would escape sin. Your very state of being is as aresult of sin - the original sin!The strongest instinct of every living creature is self-preservation,which brings us to the last of the “seven deadly sins” - anger. Is it not ourself-preservation instinct which is aroused when someone harms us and webecome angry enough to protect ourselves from further attack? A Satanistpractices the motto: “If a man smite thee on one cheek, smash him on theother!” Let no wrong go unredressed. Be as a lion in the path; be dangerouseven in defeat!Since man’s natural instincts lead him to sin, all men are sinners; andall sinners go to Hell. If everyone goes to Hell, then you will meet all of yourfriends there. Heaven must be populated by some very strange creatures ifall they live for is to go to a place where they can strum harps for eternity.We have been told that Hell is a terrible place consisting of a huge lakeof fire. Pleasure, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Christianmissionaries were very unsuccessful in Alaska because, to an Eskimo whoknows nothing other than freezing weather, a perpetual lake of fire is veryinviting. To the distress of the missionaries, the Eskimos asked, “How dowe get there?”Hell has always been the mold from which Heaven has been cast.Heaven or Paradise, to most people, represents a vision of having theirdesires fulfilled … these very desires being those which, if practiced duringtheir earthly lives, would certainly have sent them to Hell!Life is an indulgence, death an abstinence. For a person who is satisfiedwith his earthly existence, life is like a party, and no one likes to leave agood party. Similarly if a person is enjoying himself here on earth, he willnot so readily give up his life for the promise of an afterlife about which heknows nothing.In most religions death is touted as a beautiful, spiritual awakening.This is very appealing to one who has not had a satisfactory life. But tothose who have experienced all of the joys that life has to offer, there is a- 712 -great dread attached to dying. This is as it should be. It is this lust for lifethat will allow the vital person to live on after the inevitable death of hisfleshly shell.The only time an animal will resort to suicide is if he is in such pain orlife is so unbearable that death comes as an indulgence rather than anabstinence. Suicide is considered a sin. It is rather curious that the onlytime death, for a human being, is considered sinful is when it comes as anindulgence.The four principal devils are: Leviathan, representing the sea; Lucifer,the lord of the air or bearer of light; Belial, the lord of the earth; andSatan,lord of the fire.One of the main goals of the Church of Satan is to build pleasure domesin which the members of the Church can indulge themselves in theirpersonal desires. By having a place where they can go to release theirdesires, the members can lead an unfrustrated life in the everyday world.Satanism advocates indulgence, not compulsion. Compulsion is verydifferent from indulgence. When a person cannot control his desires and isa slave to these urges, they become compulsions. If a person has no properrelease for his desires, they rapidly build up and become compulsions. Apleasure dome would consist of many different rooms and recreationalfacilities for the purpose of fulfilling each member’s personal desires.Satanism represents responsibility to the responsible instead ofconcern for psychic vampires. Satanism represents kindness to those whodeserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates. Psychic vampires areindividuals who drain others of their vital existence. We might feelresponsible to such people yet not know why. These types of persons can befound in all avenues of society. They fill no useful purpose in our lives andare neither love objects nor true friends. We must rid ourselves of thesepsychic vampires so that we can devote our time to the people about whomwe truly care. Rituals which can be performed to rid ourselves of thesepeople will be discussed later.The Satanist believes in fulfillment of the ego. Satanism, in fact, is theonly religion which advocates the intensification or the encouragement ofthe ego. All other religions on the face of the Earth are concerned only withthe dissolution of man’s ego. Only if a person’s ego is sufficiently fulfilledcan he afford to be kind and complimentary to others without robbinghimself of his self-respect. Braggarts are very insecure people. We generallythink of a braggart as a person with a large ego, but in reality it is hisunfulfilled ego which leads to his bragging as a means of satisfying his ego.- 713 -To become a Satanist one does not have to “sell his soul to the Devil”.This concept was developed by Christianity to terrorize people so that theywould not stray from the fold. It was taught that if you gave in to thetemptations of Satan and lived your life in an indulgent manner, you wouldhave to pay Satan with your soul when you died. And what is the soul, asreligionists would have it, but a passport to everlasting life? People were ledto believe that selling their souls to the Devil meant that they would sufferin Hell for the rest of eternity. This type of ridiculous thinking is what theChristian church has used to keep its parishioners in line. Phrases like“God-fearing” are indicative of the basis for the Christian religion. It isthrough such fear that Christianity has been able to exist all these years.We are no longer supplicating weaklings trembling before anunmerciful “God” who cares not whether we live or die. It has been apopular misconception that the Satanist does not believe in God. This is notso; but we realize that God, by whatever name he is given - or by no name atall, is only the balancing factor in nature and has little concern for anysuffering which we may encounter. It has been said that the good die young.The good, by Christian standards, do die young. It is the frustration of ournatural instincts that leads to the premature deterioration of our bodies.When one commits a wrong in other religions, he either prays to Godfor forgiveness or confesses to an intermediary and asks him to pray to Godfor his sins. The Satanist feels that confessing to another human being likehimself accomplishes nothing and is degrading. When a Satanist commits awrong, he realizes it is natural to make mistakes. If we are truly sorry aboutsomething, we will learn from our mistakes and not do the same thingagain.There has been much sensationalism regarding the Satanic Church andits views on free love. Free love in the Satanic Church means that a personis free to either be faithful to one person or indulge in his sexual desireswith as many others as he feels necessary to satisfy his personal needs.Satanism advocates any type of sexuality which properly satisfies theperson’s desires, be it heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, or evenasexuality if you choose - or any of the fetishes pertaining to these. To mostpeople masochism represents a rejection of indulgence. We considermasochism to be an indulgence if any attempt to sway or change the personfrom his masochistic traits is met with resentment and/or failure. Satanismdoes not encourage orgiastic activities or extramarital affairs for those towhom they do not come naturally. Being unfaithful to one’s chosen matewould be very unnatural and detrimental to some people. To others it- 714 -would be frustrating to be bound sexually to one person without any hopeof outside sexual activity. Each person must decide for himself what form ofsexual activity best suits his individual needs. To thine own self be true.Self-deceit is intolerable in the Satanic religion.There are two major holidays in the Satanic religion. These areWalpurgisnacht, which is celebrated on April 30th, and Halloween, October31st. The solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated as holidays. On theseoccasions special rituals are performed, and festivities follow.Part II: Ritual MagicRitual magic is a large part of the Satanic religion. The purpose inperforming a ritual is to accomplish something that, by other means, couldnot be done. Ritual magic is a very real power. It utilizes such tools ashypnosis, telepathy, psychology, etc. The type of magic practiced in theSatanic Church is similar to all primitive forms of magic that have beenused successfully for centuries, but which have been brought into thecontemporary world in a workable way that will relate to the society inwhich we live.A Satanic ritual is basically an emotional rather than an intellectualperformance. For this reason certain devices and dramatic effects are used.As in stage magic, the art of misdirection is one of the most valuable tools ofthe ritual magician. By utilizing the following devices the ritual magiciancan temper his intellectual analysis of the ritual. Therefore he can allow hisemotions free reign.A nude female is used as the altar in Satanic rituals because sherepresents the Earth mother and is a natural passive receptor for theworkings of magic. The devices used in a Satanic ritual are as follows:- The Chalice, symbolic of the Chalice of Ecstasy, is to be drunk fromfirst by the Priest, then by one assistant.- The Bell is used to purify the air at the beginning of the ritual and isused as a pollutionary at the end of the ritual.- The Phallus is a pagan fertility symbol, the symbol of generation oraggression. It is also a non-hypocritical version of the holy water sprinklerof other religions. The Phallus is used to bless the congregation.- Candles are symbolic of the light of Lucifer - the bearer of light,enlightenment, burning desire, and the flames of the pit. Candles should bethe only light source during a ritual.- 715 -- The Sword is symbolic of aggressive force, and is used as an extensionand intensifier of the arm the Priest uses to gesture or point. A parallel tothis is the pointing stick or blasting wand used in other forms of magicalritual.- The Gong is used to call up the Powers of Darkness.The male participants in the ritual should wear black robes. Womenshould wear the most sexually appealing clothing possible, or all black forolder women. The amulet of Baphomet is worn by all participating in theritual. The color black represents the Powers of Darkness. Sexuallyappealing clothing worn by women is stimulating to the male members andintensifies the outpouring of adrenaline energy to ensure a more powerfulworking.During a Satanic ritual it is essential to summon up the strongestemotions that will be beneficial to the respective working. The following areexamples of this:During a compassion ritual it is necessary for the magician to feelhonest sympathy and compassion for the recipient of his working. It isuseless to attempt a ritual of this type if the magician cannot truly feelcompassion for the person involved. It is all very well and good to tell aperson that you will perform a compassion ritual for him, but unless youhave the necessary deep feelings for this person and are sympathetic to hissituation, the ritual will not be effective. We oftentimes think that we mightperform a ritual for a person for whom we really have no concern; but it is asad but true fact of magic that, if we are not intensely concerned for theperson, the ritual will not work. You should be able to shed an honest tearfor this person. If this much emotion cannot be felt, it is best not to attemptthis type of working. If you are the type of person who excuses his inabilityto do this by thinking “I am not that emotional” or “I’ve never been able tocry”, then it is high time you learned how.In a hate ritual in which a curse is to be conjured, a strong feeling ofcontempt for the recipient of the curse is mandatory. In a ritual of this sortthe more vindictive your curse can be, the more powerful your outpouringof hate forces will be. Love is one of the most powerful emotions known toman; the other is hate. Without being able to experience one of theseemotions, you cannot fully experience the other. Therefore you must lovethose who deserve and return your love, but hate your enemies with awhole heart. Halfhearted hatred is very harmful to a person’s emotionalstability. When a person prays for his enemies, he is in reality bottling uphis feelings of hatred. He still hates the person; but, being bound by the- 716 -tenets of his religion, he cannot express the hatred he feels. To pray for yourenemies is to buy secondhand hate, which is of a decidedly inferior quality.The harboring of unwarranted guilt is very detrimental. We have beentaught to feel guilty for all of the things that we most naturally do. Many ofus can realize intellectually that it is foolish to feel guilty for thesenaturalacts, but to accept this emotionally is another matter. If you cannot releaseyourself from guilt, then you should learn to make it work for you. Youshould act upon your natural instincts and then, realizing that you cannotperform these acts without feeling guilty, revel in your guilt. This maysound like a contradiction in terms, but guilt can often add a fillip to thesenses. Adults would do well to take a lesson from children. Children oftentake delight in doing something they know they are not supposed to. One ofthe first laws of magic is to turn every disadvantage into an advantage. Thequickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight line. If all theguilts that have been built up can be turned into advantages, thenintellectual scraping of the psyche - in an attempt to cleanse it of theserepressions - is eliminated. Satanism is the only religion known to man thataccepts this rationale [of turning a bad thing into a good thing] rather thanthat of bending over backwards to eliminate the bad thing.The Satanist shuns terms such as hope and prayer, as they areindicative of negative thinking. If we hope or pray for something to comeabout, we will not act in a positive way which will make it happen. TheSatanist commands, rather than prays to his god. Positive thinking resultsin positive actions. Through positive thinking, combined with ritual, wecommand the forces of nature. We tell ourselves “this will be done, comeHell or high water”, and therefore it is done.Human beings have personality traits which are either passive oraggressive. Passivity and aggressiveness are tamer terms for masochismand sadism. We are all made up of varying degrees of these personalitytypes. Some of us lean more towards one or the other, but it is rare to findan individual who has equal portions of each of these traits. If a person isbasically passive or masochistic, he would be most proficient in the mysticor mediumistic side of Satanism. This type of person is the most naturalpsychic or medium. Such persons’ very passivity puts them in a position ofreceptivity.Since magic is based on positive force, the person who is basicallyaggressive or sadistic in personality traits will do well as a magician. In thefield of magic and Satanism, both passive and aggressive people arenecessary. The aggressive person is best suited for sending forces, and the- 717 -passive or mediumistic person is best utilized as a receptor. Generally aperson with a great deal of perception is passive.It has been the popular misconception that Satanists practice humansacrifice. There has, however, never been a clarification of the method usedfor sacrifice, or of the reasons for which a Satanist would resort to this.When we sacrifice a person in a Satanic ritual, we do not slaughter him onthe altar in a physical manner. We simply direct our hate forces towards thedeserving recipient. You must never direct a curse toward a person unlessyou are prepared for the ultimate consequences.There is no such thing as a mild curse. If a curse is to be effective, youmust feel the maximum in disdain and hatred for the recipient. By sendingthese hate forces forth, we ensure suffering on the part of the person whohas dealt us an injustice. It can only be left to the victim’s environmentalconditions to decide what form our retribution will take, and a measure ofthe person’s rottenness as to the degree he will suffer.If the recipient of the curse has redeeming qualities of sufficientamounts, then he will not only be saved but will be rehabilitated into amore worthwhile person as a result of the curse. Therefore you cannotperform a working of this type and specify that you want the person tosuffer only a broken arm or mild illness. You must realize that death may bethe final outcome of a magical working of this nature.The Satanic Church feels that forcing oneself to feel indiscriminate lovefor all is very unnatural. There has never been any great love movement inthe history of the world that has not wound up killing countless numbers ofpeople to prove, we must assume, how much they loved them. Everyhypocrite that ever walked the earth has had pockets bulging with love! Youcannot love everyone, and by trying to you only lessen your feelings for thepeople who deserve your love. Repressed hate can lead to many physicalailments. For this reason you must periodically perform a hate ritual to ridyourself of this bottled-up hate. By choosing a deserving target for yourhate forces, you cleanse yourself of these malignant emotions and are freeto give your loved ones full benefit of your emotions without beingconcerned that you may be, at times, taking your pent-up hatred out onthem.There is a definite period of the day when a person is in a morereceptive state than during other times. Assuming that the person regularlysleeps for eight hours, the receptive state comes in the last two hours or sobefore awakening. This has been established as the period of time in whichthe person has the dreams he can recall most easily. This is due to the fact- 718 -that the person’s body has completed its required rest; but the slow rate ofmetabolism keeps it dormant for a short time afterwards, producing themost receptive time during total sleep. This is when we receive some of ourmost fruitful ideas. It is the twilight period between sleep and waking. Aperson’s subconscious is at its most active point during this period of time.It is during this period that a telepathic communication would have the bestchance of being received. To be most effective, therefore, your magicalworking should be performed during this twilight period.There are many herbs and spices which are used in ritual magic. Themost common ingredient used in love potions is mandrake root. Just asmost acts which are considered evil are within the law, so some of the mosteffective ingredients used in potions can be legally obtained. There is noneed to resort to popular and/or illegal drugs for any magical purpose.The magical language used in Satanic ritual is Enochian. Enochian is alanguage which is thought to be older than Sanskrit, with a soundgrammatical and syntactical basis. It was developed into a practicaltranslation, which is its current form, by Samuel Liddell MacGregorMathers. In Enochian the meaning of the words, combined with the qualityof the words, unite to create a pattern of sound which can causetremendous reaction in the atmosphere. The barbaric tonal qualities of thislanguage give it a truly magical effect which cannot be described.It is thought by most that all Satanic rituals are in the form of the BlackMass. This is a misconception. Most Satanic rituals have nothing in themwhich would be considered sacrilegious to another religion. One of thereasons a Black Mass would be performed in the Satanic Church would beto remove a stigma attached to the activities of one or several members. If aperson feels bound or stifled by a previous religion, a Black Mass would beperformed to enable him to completely divorce himself from the limitingfactors of that past religion.A Black Mass consists of such things as saying the Lord’s Prayerbackwards - interspersed with obscenities, trampling the cross underfoot orhanging it upside-down, desecration of the wafer or host, and similar formsof defilement or parody of the sacred cows which make the religion a threatto the person involved. By reducing the awesomeness of the religion toridiculousness, we remove its fearsomeness.The only other circumstance in which a Black Mass would beperformed would be one in which another religion had directly attacked theSatanic Church. To perform a Black Mass just for its shock value wouldserve no useful purpose. The Christian religion is no threat to the Satanist.- 719 -One might say that the Devil has kept all the religions on earth in businessfor many, many years. If it were not for these religions which he hasallowed to flourish, Satan could not come forth now and establish hisorganized church, built on the very episcopacy and structure of the existingreligions.Satanism is taken up by most people not out of protest, but out of logic.Therefore the debasement of their previous religions is unnecessary. Thereare many sacred cows in our current society which warrant protest as muchif not more than the Christian religion. A modern-day form of the BlackMass might consist of such things as urinating on marijuana, crushing anLSD sugar cube under foot, hanging a picture of Timothy Leary or a famousIndian guru upside-down, exposing the parallel between the Hippiegeneration and the “emperor’s new clothes”. These things would be farmore effective to the magical workings of a Satanist than a typical BlackMass.The results of a magical working will start to manifest themselveswithin thirty-six hours from the time the ritual was performed. Once themagical working has been performed, you must push all thoughts of hopeor anxiety from your mind. You have released your emotions and sent themout into the ether, where they can effect your desired results. After thisthere is nothing left to do but sit back and wait for the results. Anxiety onlyacts to lessen the effectiveness of your working.The Satanic ritual is not always confined to sinister or occultsurroundings. The true magician is adept at turning any situation heencounters into a magical working. He can manipulate his surroundings tohis best advantage.A ritual which is performed for the sake of reducing an awesome figureto a ridiculous state is called a Shibboleth ritual. In this type of ritual eachof the participants chooses a pillar of society or a type of person who isparticularly awesome or irritating to him. Each then dresses in the costumeof the chosen victim. For about an hour all participants communicate withone another, all the while acting out in parody what would be the actions ofthe persons portrayed.After this psychodrama has been performed, a sort of kangaroo court isheld, and the person acting as Priest for the ritual takes the role of Satan. Inthe form of Satan he questions each person individually. Each participantanswers Satan’s questions in the manner in which his chosen characterwould answer them. Through the favorite tools of the Devil, wile and guile,Satan exposes the character for what he is. He talks him into selling his soul- 720 -to the Devil, utilizing things which are sacred cows to the shibboleth for thepurpose of disguising his tactics.In a ritual such as this, the purpose is to ridicule the shibboleth. In thisway he will no longer be awesome to the person who has suffered in someway by his actions. The situation in which the Satanist comes in contactwith the shibboleth may be one in which he is forced to treat him in a civilor even respectful manner, but once the ritual has been performed, theSatanist can laugh up his sleeve at the person. The shibboleth will sensethat he is being patronized and will no longer feel that he is capable ofwielding the power that he once did over the Satanist.Part III: Magic as Practiced by the Satanic ChurchThere are many facets of magic that can be learned only throughexperience. A magus is one who has become adept in the field of ritualmagic. There are many scholars of magic who are not capable of putting thetheories which they have learned into practice. Others may have very littleformal training in magic but may have a natural ability to utilize the Powersof Darkness. Knowledge can be a powerful tool, but without the commonsense to put this knowledge into practice, it is useless. Animals and smallchildren are the most natural magicians. They have had little or no formaltraining and yet are adept at bending people and situations to their will.The Satanist regards these small beings as sacred and realizes that he canlearn much from them.The Satanic Church is different from all other witchcraft or magicalgroups in the world today. It is unlike the white magical groups, such asthose in which the powers of magic are supposedly used only for altruisticpurposes. Nor is it a primitive group of cannibals whose membership ismade up of uneducated people. The Satanic Church is the first organizationof its kind whose membership consists largely of responsible, respectablepeople. Only by limiting our membership to individuals of this variety,rather than appealing to the lunatic fringe, can we be certain of becomingthe strongest power structure in the world. Therefore membership in theSatanic Church is not open to everyone. Unlike other religions in which yougo to church to become a worthwhile person, in the Satanic religion youmust be a worthy person before you can come into church. Once in theChurch, you can reap the rewards which you deserve. The Satanic Churchhas too much to offer to afford membership to people who are only seeking- 721 -sensationalism or are of a personality makeup that would reflect upon theSatanic religion in an unfavorable way.The Satanic Church looks with disdain upon white witchcraft groups, aswe feel that altruism is sinning on the layaway plan. It is unnatural not tohave the desire to gain things for yourself. This does not mean that younever do anything for anyone else. If you do something to make someonefor whom you care happy, his happiness will give you a sense ofgratification. We practice a modified form of the Golden Rule. Ourinterpretation of this rule is: “Do unto others as they do unto you.” If you“do unto others as you would have them do unto you” and they in turn treatyou badly, it goes against human nature to continue to treat such peoplewith consideration. You may do unto others as you would have them dounto you; but if your kindness is not returned, they should be treated withthe wrath they deserve.White witchcraft groups spout the theory that, if you curse a person, itwill “return to you threefold”, “come home to roost”, or in some way“boomerang back to the curser”. This is yet another indication of the guilt-ridden philosophy held by these neo-pagan, pseudo-Christian groups.These people want to delve into witchcraft but cannot divorce themselvesfrom the stigma attached to it. Therefore they call themselves whitemagicians and base seventy-five percent of their philosophy on the trite andhackneyed tenets of Christianity.Anyone who pretends to be interested in magic for reasons other thangaining personal power is the worst kind of hypocrite. The Satanic Churchrespects Christianity at least for being consistent in its guilt-riddenphilosophy, but it can only feel contempt for people who attempt to appearemancipated from guilt by joining a witchcraft group and then practice thesame basic philosophy as Christianity. White magic is supposedly onlyutilized for good or unselfish purposes; and black magic, we are told, isused only for selfish reasons. In the Satanic Church we draw no dividingline between white or black magic. Magic is magic, be it used to help orhinder. You the magician should have the ability to decide what is just andthen apply the powers of magic to attain your goals.The Satanic Church combines two very paradoxical words in its title.There is a definite reason for this. The word “church” is a respected andrevered term. To combine the word “church” with the outrageousness ofSatan is to employ one of the most important magical formulas - theutilization of nine parts acceptability to one part outrageousness. To be atrue magician you must, in all outward appearances, be acceptable to the- 722 -establishment - and then use outrageous methods to undermine a situation.This again involves the art of misdirection.If you have an appearance of respectability and then present anunorthodox idea, it will be accepted much more readily than it would be ifyou present an appearance which does not conform to the average person’simage of respectability. For example, five thousand people marching downthe street dressed in outlandish costumes and wearing the badges ofantagonism will only succeed in alienating themselves more strongly fromthe forces they desire to change. If these marchers would appear in theguise of those whom they would change, then the needed identificationcould be established and inroads gained.Human beings are very egotistical creatures. We will be much morereceptive to a new idea if it is presented to us by someone who is for themost part like ourselves than we would be if it were presented by a personcompletely alien to us. Only by working side by side with the establishmentcan we create any sizable change in our society. Satanism is the onlyreligion in which a person can “turn on” to the pleasures around himwithout “dropping out” of society. By “dropping out” we would only depriveourselves of the enjoyable things that society has to offer. We would alsolimit the situations in which we could perform our magical workings.Our Christianized society cannot deny the existence of Satan, for to doso would require it to deny the existence of God. For that matter anyattempt on the part of any religion to deny the existence of Satan, bywhatever name he is called, would be to deny the contents of its respectivescriptures.- 723 -Appendix 2: L’Air Epais (Ceremony of the Stifling Air)- by Anton Szandor LaVeyThis was the ritual which was performed upon entering the 6° of theOrder of the Knights Templar. It celebrates a reawakening of the flesh and acasting out of past denials. A symbolic rebirth is attained through acontrived ceremony of death. This ritual corresponds to what would be the34° of Masonry, should such a degree exist. The Rites of Hiram stop at the32°, with an additional 33° confirmed under honorary circumstances. The32° of Masonry equates to the 5° of the Templars.The 5° consists of the going forth into the Devil’s pass, and thererenouncing all of the foibles and hypocrisies of the world in order to dwellwithin the tower of Satan. The American Masonic equivalent to this is theAncient Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. The A.A.O.N.M.S. havethinly disguised the anti-Christian elements of this ritual by referring to theplace beyond the Devil’s pass as where they might “worship at the shrine ofIslam”.The connection between this degree and the practices of the Yezidis isobvious. The Templars’ 5° readied the initiate for the Satanic Mass, thepractice of which was to become their undoing. With the passing of the 6°,the initiate renounced all prospects of spirituality and accepted carnality asthe gate to higher planes of existence. This is the ritual of the death-defiantand allows any unconscious death-wishes to be exorcised. It is a statementof the delights of life as opposed to the negation brought about by death.The celebrant in the ritual is represented as a saint, martyr, pope, orsome other paragon of selflessness. This is done to emphasize the transitionbetween celibacy and life-denial, to carnality and indulgence.The element of rebirth takes place within a coffin. The coffin contains anude woman whose task lies in administering awakenings of lust in thedead man who enters the coffin. This ritual can serve a twofold purpose. Itcan act as a rejection of death and dedication to life, or as a blasphemyagainst those who would crave misery, self-denial, and death. The celebrantwho is life-loving can release all needs for self-abasement by willingly“dying”, thereby exorcising all negative motivations which he mightentertain. The Stifling Air is a means of dying, getting it over with and outof one’s psyche, and at the same time turning the very accouterments ofdeath into the instruments of lust and life. The coffin is the principal deviceused, as it contains the manifestation of a force that is stronger than death -the symbol of lust that produces new life - an object of sexual desirability.- 724 -This is the same coffin symbolism that is employed in all lodge rituals withits euphemistic veneer removed.The analogy of punishment and blasphemy applies when a trulycelibate celebrant is used in the ceremony. This type of celebrant can act asa surrogate for the masochistic tendencies of the participants, while heactually suffers a fate worse than death in being confronted within thecoffin by unexpected passions rather than a longed-for reward of spiritualunfolding for which he has so long abstained. The greater punishment isincurred in the celibate when one views his abstinence as an indulgence;and a fate far worse than death occurs when he enters the coffin, preparedfor heavenly glories, only to find that the very carnal pleasures he has spenthis time avoiding in life are now thrust upon him.A form of Black Mass was incorporated into the Stifling Air followingthe banishment of the Templars and the execution of their last GrandMaster, Jacques DeMolay. The celebrant was portrayed as Pope Clement V,who, with Philip the Fair, caused the end of the Templars as a powerstructure. In these post-fourteenth century versions of the ritual, theparticipant portraying DeMolay acts as the supreme tribune, serving asjudge, jury, and executioner of the Pope, thereby avenging himself.This ritual can be effectively used as a cursing vehicle towards a psychicvampire or one who thrives on misery. Through an interchange wherebythe celebrant assumes the role of the person to be cursed, the celebrantexorcises his fears and need for self-abasement into the victim of his curse,who by his natural masochism is perfectly attuned to acceptance of such atransference on the part of the celebrant. Once the celebrant enters thecoffin, the victim’s essence readily enters with him. As the confrontationwith the lust object within the coffin occurs, the celebrant is reborn;whereas his masochistic surrogate whom he curses is immersed in thefiercest of Hells - expectation of martyrdom replaced by unexpected joy. Tothe masochist this surely is torment. Thus when a “man of god” is portrayedas the celebrant, destruction is directed towards religions of self-hate.The title “Stifling Air” refers both to the tension produced by thecontrived atmosphere of oppression during the early part of the ritual, andthe sensory deprivation engendered by the entombment. This has long beena highly secret ceremony for obvious reasons, the climate of the times nowpermitting its emergence. The Stifling Air is virtually impossible to performwithout bringing blasphemy upon the Christian ethic; hence its expulsionfrom Masonic ritual. The pragmatic exclusion of this rite from Masonrybrings a halt to ceremonial progression beyond the 32° (5° of the- 725 -Templars). The numerous manifestations of Satanism in Masonic ritual(goat, coffin, death’s head, etc.) can be whitewashed easily, but the rejectionof spiritual values demanded by the Stifling Air cannot be cloaked inaccepted theologies. Once the celebrant has taken this degree, he embarksupon the Left-Hand Path and chooses Hell in place of Heaven. The StiflingAir is a memento mori carried to its highest power.The ChamberThe ritual chamber must be either black in color or mirrored. If black,it is advisable to utilize heavy velvet draperies for wall covering, althoughpainted walls will be adequate. A mirrored chamber is unquestionably best,as it provides for a greater confrontation by the celebrant, making himhyperconscious of his role. Mirrors also add to the “robbing of the soul” asper tradition. The light trap provided by a mirrored chamber intensifies theaction which is taking place.A rather austere chair is provided for the celebrant to sit in during thefirst part of the ritual. The coffin may be of any type, although thetraditional hexagonal style is best. This is the type depicted in the actualsigil of the 6° of the Templars, and it is combined with the skull andcrossbones in Masonic symbology. The trapezoidal geometrics of this typeof coffin are more noticeable than in any other style.DevicesThe usual devices conducive to Satanic ritual are all employed.Additional accouterments include a cat-o-nine-tails with which to scourgethe celebrant, a cruet for the Wine of Bitterness, a goblet, and tattered anddecaying vestments for the celebrant.If the post-fourteenth century version is performed, King Philip ofFrance should be represented as counsel for Pope Clement (celebrant). TheKing is dressed in tatters, with a mock cardboard crown, and bumblinglyattempts to intercede for the Pope. DeMolay is dressed in Satanic splendor,with the symbols of his office upon him.The woman in the coffin should be of a seductive nature andappearance, antithetical to the wan and pale concept usually associatedwith death.- 726 -The ProcedureThe ceremony begins in the usual manner with the ringing of the bell,acceptance of the chalice, etc. The 12th Enochian Key is read, and the Gamebegins.The Pope (celebrant) and his counsel are confronted by DeMolay, whoproceeds to inflict his diatribe upon the celebrant. His accusations shouldbe harsh and unrelenting. The celebrant should react in a suitable mannerfor one accustomed to sanctimonious righteousness. After thedenunciations have been made, allowing the counsel to intercede onoccasion, judgment is passed and the Priest proceeds to read the litany -extracts from James Thomson’s “The City of Dreadful Night” as follows:Proem, stanza 6; VII, stanza 2; VIII, stanzas 7-13; XI, entire; XIII, stanza 2;XIV, stanzas 7 and 11-14; and XVII, stanza 1.Stopping halfway through the litany, the Priest signals that the Wine ofBitterness be proffered to the celebrant, who, accepting his last drink,listens while the litany is completed. When the litany of the denier of life iscompleted, the Priest signals to make ready for the final abasement and joyfor the celebrant.The lictors (guards) remove the celebrant from his seat and place himon the coffin’s lid. The Priest then reads the 12th Key in Enochian while thecelebrant is scourged. The scourger must be one who would normally beattractive to the celebrant, as this adds to the debasement. If this ceremonyis conducted with a homophile portraying the celebrant, the coffin shouldcontain another male. In all areas of the ritual, the element of pleasureshould present itself in that which would most likely be denied in thecelebrant’s life.After the scourging is completed, the celebrant is removed from the lidof the coffin. The Priest then knocks three times with either a staff or thepommel of the sword upon the coffin. A scream is heard from within thecoffin, and the lid is lifted from within, seductive movements beingemployed. The celebrant is borne by the lictors and placed within the coffin,and the lid is shut, leaving him to his doom or renewal as the case may be.As the renewal takes place within the coffin, the Priest reads from HolyScripture, in mockery of what is taking place. After five to ten minutes thecelebrant is removed from the coffin and directed by the Priest to state hisnew sensation. The celebrant then proclaims his homage to Satan and castsaside his symbols of martyrdom. The Priest presents his final proclamation,and the ceremony is closed in the usual manner.- 727 -Appendix 3: The Ceremony of the Avoosal- by Anton Szandor LaVeyThe ritual chamber is embellished with an immense spiderwebstretched across one wall, with a huge spider in its center. A man’s body isimpaled on the spider’s mandibles. Otherwise the usual devices are present.The Avoosal815 is the Satanic name for the Spider-King whotraditionally lurks within the caverns of the earth wherein are kept thetreasures man seeks. It is said that the Avoosal feeds upon such seekers ofhis riches as would dare defy his sanctity. He lies in wait for the brashthieves, and when they have begun to load their sacks, he scuttles down hisweb and devours them. He is to the earth what the dragon Fafnir representsin his guardianship of the gold within the Rhine.The spider has served as the legendary harbinger of wealth, and it issaid that to dream of a spider ensures forthcoming riches. The Avoosalappears by various names in Norse, Russian, Near Eastern, African, Asian,and North and South American Indian accounts. To win the favor of theAvoosal is to gain wealth, but one must first admit to alliance with the godsof the earth whom the Avoosal serves. The spider of the field and house isthe Great Avoosal’s kin, and the wanton destruction of such creatures isassurance of disfavor. Because the spider, who is of general benefit to man,is made a social outcast and considered fearsome and ugly, he is relegatedto the Devil’s court. Hence we honor him.The ritual begins in the usual manner. After the chalice has been drunkfrom, the Eighteenth Key is read, the Game begins, and the Avoosal iscalled forth:The caverns beckon those who seek the riches of the earth. Great are thejewels therein. There are many caverns, it is said, and for each cavern thereare many who would delve within. The greatest gems are fraught with danger,815 Anton LaVey borrowed the curious term “Avoosal” from one of Clark AshtonSmith’sstories, “The Weird of Avoosl Wuthoqquan”, which first appeared in Weird TalesinJune 1932. Part of Smith’s Hyperborean series, this is the tale of a rich andgreedymoneylender, Avoosl Wuthoqquan, who discovers a cave laden with jewels, only tofindthem guarded by - and himself ultimately devoured by - their owner: “The entitywaswholly and outrageously unhuman; and neither did it resemble any species ofanimal, orany known god or demon of Hyperborea … it was very large and pale and squat,with atoad-like face and a swollen, squidgy body and numerous cuttlefish limbs orappendages.” For this ritual, then, Anton changed the demon to a moreconventional [ifenlarged] spider, and gave it the name of the victim in Smith’s story.- 728 -and the abyss which hides the gems is guarded well. Out from the haunts ofman exists a door of mirrored, angled stone. Upon its face is seen a star, andye shall know it darkly. To come upon the cavern’s portal fills the dreams ofpaupers, fools, and kings. So too the Devil-bought do fantasie to hiethemselves unto the fulgent grotto. The jewels lie languishing in iridescentsleep and drip their radiant splendor as they dream. Their place is overseen byeyes that glare; and, hovering close, their warder walks on many legs. Smallmen who seek the gate of riches do pray to gods inviolate, and scarce will viewthe grotto. And happy they should be, for in their failure they are saved.O great spawn of the dank and dripping walls of Koboldom, they crave tosee thy twilit grotto, bathed all in ruby hues. Yet they have killed thy kin andknow not thou lurketh, awaiting their approach. They crave to plunder of thyhall, yet crush thy tiny minions ’neath their feet! I have heard them runshrieking from thy brothers, yet they come to steal thy bounty. O great andmighty spider-king, borne on the web that man calls fate, the Kobolds dance asaraband this night, and Arachne calls across the fierce Simoon. O thou whowalkest in octaves and guardest the vaults of Croesus, come forth this night,for I would grant thee audience.I call thee forth, O great intelligence who walkest out upon his self-created symmetries. How small the minds of those who dare thy grotto,knowing not the substance of thy role. I say to ye who seek wealth: Be friendlyunto him who guardest the vault. Be friendly unto him who guardest the vault.Yea, be friendly unto him who guardest the vault!Avoosal! Hear! Avoosal! Appear! In the name of Mammon, bring forththe substance of the baubles of the earth! I am one with thee, O architect ofHell! Whosoever would rob thee knoweth not the venom of thy mandibles,and verily he placeth himself before thy sickled fangs! Were thou to allow, asgrains of sand, small particles of wealth to fall into the scratching, grubbyhands of those who shout of spiritual gods, they would, but in a thrice, rejectall sainted hosts. Their Heaven would be but a place of barren exile while theysifted through their palsied fingers baubles wrought in Hell! They crave thyhoard, yet kill thy kin. They wish thy jewels, yet speak of sin. They deny ourgod, yet lust for gold - and barter on the barren wold of city-states growncold!I close the portal on them now and speak with thee, O spider-king. Ihonor thee and credit thee with meaning and with wisdom. I thank thee, Oscuttling lurker in the shadows, for thou hast prepared for me a place ofsplendor. Thou hast given me the sign when I did gaze upon thy childe as fromthis vaulted chamber. And so with tenderness I saved thy childe. And suddenlythere came upon me stupendous revelation, and then I knew that I was he!O great and mighty spider-king, my Kobolds dance a saraband this night,and as Arachne howls across the fierce Simoon, this I promise thee, O mightyAvoosal: Thy grottos shall be filled unto the nethermost recesses with thecarcasses of avaricious and sanctimonious god-adorers. And when thou hastreduced them to the pulp of their uselessness, the Kobolds will take theirhusks to fuel their fires. And more shall I send thee! Hundreds! Thousands!- 729 -Millions of them! And thou shalt grow unto a mighty creature of tarantulandimensions, and thy mandibles shall become as scythes with which to reap theDevil’s harvest!If one is to obtain great treasure, one must entertain its guardian. Butfirst one must know the sign and speak the name of him who dwells within thegreat abyss. Avoosal! Hear! Avoosal! Appear! In the name of Mammon, bringforth the substance of the baubles of the earth! By my infernal name, appear!Avoosal! Come forth! I welcome thee into this grotto! Be not afraid, for we arethe same: the true worshippers of the highest and ineffable King of Hell!Shemhamforash! Hail, Satan!At this point, accompanied by rolling thunder, the Avoosal enters thechamber. This is effected by a small child on hands and knees covered bythe likeness of as large and realistic a spider as is possible to construct. Analternate appearance can be obtained through the use of a gigantic andrealistic spider lowered on a line from a previously unnoticed ceilinglocation. The Avoosal takes its place beside the throne from which thePriest speaks, and the litany proceeds:O great Avoosal! Thy presence is our pleasure. Our wishes we havegarnered rest upon our lips this night. O hear me, that I might speak the wordsthou knowest well.We desire great chariots, so that we might ride forth into the world, andso that it might be seen that Satan’s children ride in splendor.We desire great palaces in which to dwell, so that we might surroundourselves with reminders of our Dark Lord’s material heritage.We desire fine raiment, so that we might wear upon our backs thetrappings of the pride of Lucifer.We desire galleries in which we might surround ourselves with thingswell-wrought by crafty hands, to keep within our minds the essence of man thecreator.We desire foods of infinite variety, through which we might taste ourpraises at the shrine of gluttony.We desire bits of paper, stamped about with glyphs and known to man asmoney, so that we might buy and sell the shuffling cattle without horns, whoby their own unbalanced pride have placed themselves within the stockyard,or who - by their telltale gaze towards Heaven - thereby consign themselves totrading-pastures here on earth.We desire all these things, so we might hate with greater venom him whofinds great pain where none exists and who, blessed with body sound,complains from moon to moon and sun to sun.As each man must measure his garments, so must each new wealth bemeasured to the man. Learn this well, O my brothers and sisters - learn thiswell. Ask not the Great Avoosal for the substance of your folly, for ill-fitting- 730 -prosperity stands out in any crowd, and the marketplace is full of thieves. Nowcome ye forth and state your desires.Those who wish to state their desires should now come forth. Whenthis is accomplished, the Priest presents a final statement of his ownchoosing, and the ceremony is finalized in the usual manner.- 731 -Appendix 4: Der Wahnsinn von Andelsprutz(The Madness of Andelsprutz816 )- by Anton Szandor LaVey, 1968-1969Ten minutes of darkness precede the ritual, during which time themusic will consist of dissonances played on the organ with eccentricrhythmic backing. During the entire ceremony a 10,000-cycle B.C.U. will beactivated, and there will be short periods of silence, allowing the B.C.U. tobe heard, along with the sound of a flute piping a monotonous melody,accompanied by strokes on the gong, played softly. The usual complementof ritual participants will be present, having taken their proper places in thedarkness.The standard opening invocation is given, with the Infernal Names,Benediction, presentation of the Chalice, etc. The candles are lighted in theusual manner. Next follows the reading of the 17th Enochian Key and thenof the opening litany (Cassilda’s Song from Robert W. Chambers’ The Kingin Yellow):Along the shore the cloud waves break,The twin suns sink behind the lake,The shadows lengthenIn Carcosa.Strange is the night where black stars rise,And strange moons circle through the skies,But stranger still isLost Carcosa.Songs that the Hyades shall sing,Where flap the tatters of the King,Must die unheard inDim Carcosa.816 This ritual takes its title from Lord Dunsany’s fantasy story of the samename, butotherwise has nothing in common with it. In the Dunsany story, Andelsprutz isnot aperson, but a city whose soul abandons it, leaving the city itself merely alifelessresidence for human beings. An obvious inspiration for this ritual’s contents istheGerman Expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, in which the keeper oftheasylum is ultimately revealed to be himself insane.- 732 -Song of my soul, my voice is dead,Die though, unsung, as tears unshedShall dry and die inLost Carcosa.The Game is proclaimed. Herr Doktor Andelsprutz is brought into thechamber. He is the head of the lunatic asylum in which the Game is held.He is crazier than any of the inmates, hence he is qualified to passjudgment on their respective sanity. The Doktor’s appearance isaccompanied by the incorporation of a high-frequency oscillator which isquite audible. The oscillator sounds throughout this entire portion of theritual. Andelsprutz is wild-eyed and clad in a tightly-strapped straitjacket.He announces himself audaciously upon entering the chamber. He is seatedin an austere, straight-backed chair and faces the congregation. A Janus-figure takes its place immediately behind him and turns periodically duringthis part of the ritual, exposing first one face and then the other to thecongregation. One face depicts a voluptuary with a lewd, brazen expression.The other face is that of a debauched old man.Andelsprutz announces that he has appeared before his peers and hispatients in order that he may ascertain who is to be his emissary - who willgo into the world of lunatics and guide them in accordance with the will ofSatan. The person who is chosen must be sufficiently mad to deal with thefollies of the masses. He must be material for a great leader or outrageoushero and sympathetically insane enough for the identification necessary forthe multitudes.Andelsprutz begins the interrogation by giving audience to his peers,the staff (the participants in the ceremony). He then moves on to thepatients (the congregation). He is arbitrary to the fullest degree,establishing no set standard of insanity or folly. He criticizes, praises,studies, analyzes, and makes suggestions - all without rhyme or reason. Hebecomes angry and childish at times, stamping his feet and shouting. Atother times he becomes morose and sullen, appearing to not even hear hisaudience. He may coo and babble, breaking into a falsetto crooning whilesmiling beatifically. He might change voices as though he were carrying ona three-way conversation with the person standing before him. He callsforth the members of the congregation as he sees fit and, after all he wishesto question have been heard, arrives at his decision - based solely upon hiswhim.- 733 -Herr Doktor Andelsprutz makes his proclamation and grandioselyannounces who will be capable of doing the Devil’s work. The chosen one isasked to make a statement. Then the officiating Priest, representing HisInfernal Majesty, presents the emissary with a battered suitcase whichcontains the articles which will be needed in his work. The Priest opens thevalise and removes the articles contained therein individually, explainingtheir purpose to all present. The contents of the case are revealed to be:• Books on occult subjects (astrology, card reading, spiritualism, flyingsaucers, witchcraft, etc.) for the new believers.• A Holy Bible for the vanishing race of old believers.• A severed human head for the sensation-seekers.• A harmless bomb for the revolutionary.• A vial of drugs for the disenchanted non-materialist.• A dehydrated android for the sex-starved.• A portfolio of peace talks to inspire trust.• A pistol to protect man from other men.• A microscope with which to detect imperfections.• A spray can of black paint with which to cover up any inconvenientimperfections.• A mirror in which to gaze, to be certain of presenting the proper imagefor the occasion.• Birth control pills for those whose only attributes are their sex organs.• A book of threats, doomsdays, and convenient crises with which to retainman’s need for misery.• A praise machine which will automatically tell anyone what he wishes tohear.• A Satanic Bible for those who would appear to be likely candidates forthe asylum.The Priest then utters the final proclamation:Omnipotens eterne Satanas, spes unica mundi!Qui Infernum fabricator ades, qui conditor orbis:Tu populi memor esto tui! sic mitis ab altoProspice, ne gressum faciat, ubi regnat Erinis,Imperat Allecto, leges dictante Megera;Sed potius virtute tui, quem diligis, huiusCæsaris insignis Satanas, infame ministra,- 734 -Ut valeat ductore pio per amena virectaImperium Satanas semper nemorum sedesque beatasAd latices intrare infame, ubi semina viteInfernis animantur aquis et fonte SupernoLetificata seges spinas mundatur ademptis,Ut messis queat esse Satanæ benedicte futureMaxima centenum per horrea fructum.- 735 -Appendix 5: Die Elektrischen Vorspiele- by Anton Szandor LaVey817Vorwärts zur Schlacht! Sturmschritt voran! So jagst du die Bande zumTeufel!The fires of Hell provide, and the thoughts from within prevail! Openthe portals of darkness, O great Opener of the Way! Come forth into thiscycle! Blast thou forth through the gates of the Shining Trapezohedron, forthe blood hath been offered! Appear among men and be driven back nolonger! Come forth and creep into the great councils of those without, andstop the way of those who would detain us!I say that the glamor must be lifted, revealing the face of the Serpent!By the sounds ye shall see the face of the Serpent, so learn well the wordthat only a man can pronounce! Thus I lift the veil from the Serpent andcast him forth among men! Oh, hear! The Serpent still liveth, in a place thatis open, at times, to the world!Unseen They walk amongst us, and as we join them, so we stalk thenight unseen as well; for only through the angles might we be seen, andthose without see not, for their eyes are blinded by millstones ofrighteousness!I say unto thee who speaketh with garbled tongue: I know well thatwhich holdeth thee from leaving this cycle! I have glimpsed the Hounds ofthe Barrier, lying in wait for the souls of the righteous! They are theguardians of the cycles, and they lurk at the threshold of time, and theirspace-planes move about them, hiding them well! Move they only throughangles, though free are they not of the curved dimensions.Strange and terrible are the Hounds of the Barrier; follow theyconsciousness to the limits of space! Unseen they walk amongst ye, inplaces where the rites have been said! Some take the semblance of men,knowing not what they do; and when the blood hath been spilled, retreatthey once more into the grotto of Satan, taking the forms I know well! Someseethe as they wait, and preen their great wings, knowing full well thatonce again I shall call them forth! And the night-gaunts shall ride, andcrouching at their talons, the great Hounds lie a-waiting to leap forth intothe world!817 Inspired by Frank Belknap Long’s story The Hounds of Tindalos andplagiarized inpart from Claude Doggins’ 8th Emerald Tablet of Thoth. See Chapter #22.- 736 -Think not, O men of mildewed minds, that ye might escape the greatbeasts by entering your shrines, for they follow fast through angles, andthey lurk within the Trapezoid! I know them, for I am as one with them;and I have approached the great Barrier and have seen on the shores wheretime exists not the monolithic forms of the Hounds of the Barrier! Yea,hiding in the abyss beyond time I found them, and they, scenting me afaroff, raised themselves and gave the great bell cry that can be heard fromcycle to cycle!Dwelt I then in lairs remote from man, on the grey shores of time,beyond the world’s rim - and ever with me they moved, in angles not knownto man! On that dark threshold they crouch, their jaws agape and raveningfor the souls of those who are without!Returned I through angles back, and hard by me they followed. Yea, theDevourers followed, and thus I was and have become the Marshal of thehosts of Hell; and those who follow me and walk the Hounds and ride thewhirlwinds of the night become an army out of Hell to scourge the earthand melt the ice!From prisms wrought within the twilit grotto I speak through anglesmirrored with thoughts senescent and supreme! Oh, learn the Law, myBrothers of the Night - the Great Law and the Lesser Law. The Great Lawbringeth the balance and doth persist without mercy. The Lesser Lawabideth as the key, and the Shining Trapezoid is the door! Oh, my Brothers,study well the stone with planes unrecognized by those without, for withinthose glaring facets the Hounds await that set the world aflame! Be theangles small and still or gargantuan in their roaring outrage, the form isthat which we know so well. On that grim grey shore the monolith prevails,and clutched within the fourfold talons of the ring which Fafnir guards, thatshape remains to bring forth that which gives us increase and to smite thosewho would oppose us!O puny man, heedest thou my warning: Seek not to break open the gateto beyond. Few there are who have succeeded in passing the Barrier to thegreater twilit grotto that shines beyond. For knowest thou, ever theDwellers in the Abyss seek such souls as thine to hold in their thrall.Listen, O man of clouded brain, and heedest thou my warning: Seekestthou to move not in angles but curves. And if while free from thy body thouhearest the sound like the baying of the Hounds ringing clear and bell-likethrough thy being, flee back if thou canst to thy body through cycles, andpenetrate the mist no more! Know ye, all who dwell in the light of professedrighteousness, that others who know the keys and the angles have opened- 737 -the Gate, and for turning back there is not time! Ye have been given the key,but your minds are small and grasp not the word.Therefore listen to the sounds, O ye out there, the great bell-sounds ofthe baying of the Hounds. They are lean and athirst, the Hounds ofTindalos, and through the great, blazing Trapezoid they come, their eyesaglow with the fires of Hell! Drift if ye will into the dimensions of your outerconsciousness, and be trapped forever!Ye know not the substance of your creation! I welcome ye in the nameof Set, all ye who see great evil and sustain yourselves in miseriesunfounded. We prepare a place of comfort for ye to indwell in tormentsublime. Wrestle not the apes who guard the gates of Hell, for therein liesParadise, and Anubis is the Opener of the Way.And we speak with the tongues of serpents, and the baying of theHounds, and the great bell-sound that cracks the Barrier - and great are wewho rule, and small are ye who suffer. The day of the Cross and the Triangleis done! A great wheel with angles in dimensions unrecognized, save by thechildren of Set, fills the void and becomes as the Sun in the Firmament ofWrath!

West III°The Missa Solemnis is performed with great pageantry and solemndignity and is very precise in every detail. Every act, every movement mustbe deliberate and done with great majesty. Above all it must be done withabsolute conviction.Requirements for the performance of the Missa Solemnis - consecratedvestments from the Roman Catholic Church:• Chasuble (over-garment worn by Priest during mass).• Stole (a long, narrow stole worn around the neck).• Maniple (worn over left arm).• Girdle (A long, braided, rope-like cincture worn over alb around themidsection).• Nun’s habit with wimple.• Large cross or crucifix to be hung, inverted, on wall over altar. If the Sigilof Baphomet already occupies that area, the cross is to be hung directlyover its face, the eyes of the goat peering forth on either side.• Font for holy water (chamber pot recommended).• Small wooden bowl, roughhewn in the interior and with a roughhewnpestle for grinding the host into a pulverized state. The use ofroughhewn wood is suggested since this is symbolic of the cross uponwhich the pig purportedly died.• Thurible (censer, usually on a long chain, used for censing the altar andthe congregation).• Purification bell.• Chalice of Ecstasy (with veil).• Gong.• Incense burner for altar and desecration.• Phallic aspergillum.• Sword.• Cruet of wine (wine is specified because of its use in the Roman Rite).• As many black candles as desired.• One white candle for the burning of the host.• Container for incense (placed upon the altar) and spoon for incense.• Powdered incense (Jasmine recommended since it is reputed for itserotic effects).• Round silver spoon for the Consecratio.- 742 -• Clean white towel.• Altar stand for the Missale.• Other accouterments as traditional for the Satanic Mass.The “Missale” referred to in the text is the bound copy of the MissaSolemnis which is used on the altar. The Satanic Bible is also placed on thealtar.The altar should represent a lewd woman, lying or sitting facing theparticipants, her legs spread wide exposing her genitals and heroutstretched arms terminating in the candle holders which she grasps witheach hand. She should be ornamented with heavy, gaudy jewelry, heavilymade-up, possibly wearing shoes with spiked heels, and generally givingthe appearance of a harlot. Across her breasts is painted or drawn thenumber of the Beast, 666.The ceremony is begun in the established manner with the ringing ofthe bell, conjuration of the four names, drinking from the Chalice, etc. ThePriest places the Chalice between the thighs of the altar, where it rests untilagain required. The Priest, Deacon, and Sub-Deacon all face the altar, thenbow low once. Then, standing upright, the Priest will begin the Introitus.IntroitusPriest:In nomine dei nostri Satanas Luciferi. Introibo ad altare deinostri.Deacons:Ad dei nostri, Satanas Luciferi, qui lætificat juventutemmeam.Priest:(Psalm 42, 1-5) Judica me, deus meus. Et discerne causammeam de gente sancta.Deacons:Quia tu es Diabolus, fortitudo mea.Priest:Emitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam: Ipsa me deduxerunt,et adduxerunt in Infernum tuum.Deacons:Et introibo ad altare dei nostri, ad Satanas Luciferi quilætificat juventutem meam.Priest:Quia tu es deus meus.- 743 -Deacons:Spera in Diabolo, quoniam adhuc confitebor illi: salutarevultus mei, et deus meus.Priest:Gloria tibi, Satanas Luciferi.Deacons:Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper, et in sæculasæculorum.Priest:Introibo ad altare dei.Deacons:Ad dei nostri, Satanas Luciferi, qui lætificat juventutemmeam.Priest:Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Diaboli.Deacons:Qui fecit Infernum et terram.The Priest bows low before the altar and, remaining in that position, beginsthe Confiteor.ConfiteorPriest:I confess to almighty Satan, highest and ineffable King ofHell; to Ishtar, ever fertile; to Amon, god of life andreproduction; to Pan, whose lust does cause the sperm of lifeto flow; to Asmodeus, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan, to all theDæmons of the Pit, and to you, Brethren, that I have lived infullness and in lust and have tortured much in thought,word, and deed that naked dog who hangs upon the cross inmockery of man. Therefore I beseech thee, Satan, highestand ineffable King of Hell; Ishtar, ever fertile; Amon, god oflife and reproduction; Pan, whose lust does cause the spermof life to flow; Asmodeus, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan, all theDæmons of the Pit, and you, Brethren, to grant me lewd,licentious, lustful pleasures for all the days and nights tocome.Deacons:May the almighty Satan shower his blessings upon you andfill your fiery rod with endless streams of sperm.- 744 -The Priest stands erect.Priest:Gratia tibi, fratres.The Deacon and Sub-Deacon bow low.Deacons:I confess to almighty Satan, highest and ineffable King ofHell; to Ishtar, ever fertile; to Amon, god of life andreproduction; to Pan, whose lust does cause the sperm of lifeto flow; to Asmodeus, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan, to all theDæmons of the Pit, and to you, Reverend, servant of thePrince of Darkness, that I have lived in fullness and in lustand have tortured much in thought, word, and deed thatnaked dog who hangs upon the cross in mockery of man.Therefore I beseech thee, Satan, highest and ineffable Kingof Hell; Ishtar, ever fertile; Amon, god of life andreproduction; Pan, whose lust does cause the sperm of life toflow; Asmodeus, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan, all the Dæmonsof the Pit, and you, Reverend, servant of the Prince ofDarkness, to grant me lewd, licentious, lustful pleasures forall the days and nights to come.Priest:May the almighty Satan shower his blessings upon you andfill your fiery rods with endless streams of sperm.The Deacon and Sub-Deacon stand erect.Deacons:Gratia, Reverende.Now the entire congregation bow low as the Priest turns toward them forthe benediction.Priest:May the almighty and ineffable King of Hell grant youfullness of life and lead you to attainment in all your desires.The Priest approaches the altar and prepares for the purification of theritual chamber.- 745 -Priest:Take away from us, almighty Satan, the iniquities of that foulimposter who would deny the pleasures of thy realm andcurse us with a life of piety and want. Make us to live that wemay be made worthy of thy Infernal kingdom now and for alltime to come.Deacons:Gratia tibi, dei nostri, Satanas Luciferi.The Priest takes the phallic aspergillum from the altar and, turning to theDeacon, proffers it to him.Priest:Beloved brother, we ask a blessing.The chamber pot is brought forth and presented to the nun, who lifts herhabit and urinates into it, smiling beatifically.Deacon:In the name of Mary she maketh the font resound with thewaters of mercy. She giveth the showers of blessing andpoureth forth the tears of her shame. She suffereth long, andher humiliation is great, and she doth pour upon the earthwith the joy of her mortification. Her cup runneth over, andher water is sublime. Ave Maria ad micturiendum festinant.When the nun has finished filling the font, the Sub-Deacon takes it fromher and holds it before the Deacon, who takes the phallus and dips it intothe urine. The Deacon then takes the phallic aspergillum and, holding ittightly to his own genital area, turns to the four corners and gives theSatanic blessing, shaking the phallus twice (vigorously) at each of thecardinal points.Deacon:In the name of Satan, we bless thee with this, the symbol ofthe seed of life.In the name of Lucifer, we bless thee with this, the symbol ofthe seed of life.In the name of Belial, we bless thee with this, the symbol ofthe seed of life.In the name of Leviathan, we bless thee with this, the symbolof the seed of life.- 746 -The Deacon kisses the phallus and then passes it to the Sub-Deacon, whoalso kisses it. The Sub-Deacon then hands it to the Priest, who raises it tothe Baphomet, kisses it, and then places it on the altar.Priest:Shemhamforash!Deacons:Shemhamforash!Priest:Hail, Satan!Deacons:Hail, Satan!Priest:We ask thee, mighty Prince of Darkness, by the merits ofthese symbols here assembled that thou wilt deign to assistus in our wants and needs.The Deacon takes the thurible, and the two Deacons kneel. The Priestplaces incense in the thurible. The Deacons remain kneeling.Deacon:Benedicte, Pater Reverende.Priest:Ab illo benedicaris, in cujus honore cremaberis.The Priest takes the thurible from the Deacon. The Deacons remainkneeling. The Priest censes the altar, first the front and then both sides.Priest:Purificabo altare dei nostri, Satanas Luciferi, in cujus honorecremaberis.The Priest repeats this several times as he censes the entire altar. He turnsand censes the Deacon and Sub-Deacon separately.Deacon:Purificabo gorde tuo et labiis tuis, Pater Reverende, innomine dei nostri, Satanas Luciferi, in cujus honorecremaberis.The Deacon and Sub-Deacon stand, and the Deacon puts the thurible aside.- 747 -GloriaPriest:Glory be to thee, almighty Satan, highest and ineffable Kingof Hell; and on Earth joy to the follower of the Left-HandPath. We praise thee; we bless thee; we adore thee; we givethee thanks for thy great glory. O mighty Prince of Darkness,King of the Infernal Realm, thou art the true god, whoreplenisheth the world with pleasure and who maketh uswhole. Thou alone art lord. Thou alone, O mighty Satan, artthe most high. Thou alone art ruler of the Earth.The Priest seats himself on the throne. The Deacon and Sub-Deacon chantthe Gloria. The Priest returns to the altar and turns to face thecongregation.Priest:Diabolus vobiscum.Deacons:Et cum spiritu tuo.The Sub-Deacon removes the Missale from its stand, raises it high beforethe Baphomet, and transfers it to the Epistle (right) side of the altar. As hedoes so, the Deacon moves to the left side of the altar. The Priest then readsthe Epistle, which is taken from 2 Corinthians 4, 1-6, and 15-18.EpistlePriest:Brethren, being entrusted, then, by Satan’s pleasure withthis ministry, we do not play the coward: We renounce allshame-faced concealment; there must be no crooked waysnor falsifying of Satan’s word. It is by making the truthpublicly known that we recommend ourselves to thejudgment of mankind, as we do in Satan’s sight. Our gospelis a mystery, yes, but it is only a mystery to those who are onthe road to empty heavens: those whose unbelieving mindshave been blinded by that nefarious, foul-mouthed Jewwhom they worship, so that the glorious gospel of thealmighty Satan cannot reach them with the rays of itsillumination. After all, it is ourselves we proclaim: Weproclaim Satan as lord and ourselves as his servants. The god- 748 -of darkness has kindled the Light of Lucifer in our hearts,whose shining is to make known his glory. It is all for yoursakes, so that his pleasures may be made manifest in manylives and may increase the lust which is offered to Satan’sglory. No, we do not play the coward, for the outer part ofour nature is like that of our inner nature and is beingrefreshed from day to day. This light brings with it a rewardmultiplied every way, leading us to everlasting fulfillment.For the lies of that Nazarene king of fools shall last butshortly; what is of Satan is eternal.The Sub-Deacon returns the Missale to its stand. The Priest continues withthe Oratio, which is inverted from the Feast of the Kingship of Jesus Christ.OratioPriest:Almighty and ever-living Prince of Darkness, who has willedthat all the pleasures of the flesh shall be made manifest,grant that all the peoples of the Earth, now torn asunder bythe lies of that Judean pig, may be awakened to the truth ofhim who is Satan.The Priest continues with the Gradual, which is taken from Leviticus 21.1O,21.8, and Hebrews 2.17.GradualPriest:(Leviticus 21.1O) The High Priest, that one who is chiefamong his brethren, who is consecrated for the Priestlyoffice and who wears the sacred vestments, is altogether likehis brethren.(Hebrews 2.17) He would be a High Priest who could feel forus and be our true representative before Satan, to make ourpleasures manifest and rid us of the stench of hypocrisy.(Leviticus 21.8) The Priest must be set apart, as I am setapart, the Lord of Hell who fulfills you.- 749 -The Deacon raises the Missale on high before the Baphomet, then moves itto the Left-Hand side (the Gospel side) of the altar.Priest:Sequentia sancti evangelii secundum sancta biblia nostræ.The gong is struck. The Priest reads the Gospel of the Fifth Enochian Key.The Deacon and Sub-Deacon then kneel before the Priest, each holding hisMissale open to the Fifth Enochian Key.Deacons:Jube domne, benedicere.Priest:Diabolus sit in corde tuo, et in labiis tuis, ut digne etcompetenter annunties evangelium suum.The Priest sits upon the throne. The Deacons chant the Fifth Enochian Keytogether. The Priest returns to the altar and recites the Key in English.The Priest now begins the most solemn part of the Missa Solemnis, theDesecration. This requires a consecrated host, which must be obtainedfrom a Roman Catholic Communion.OffertoriumPriest:(Luke 1, 46-49) I have found joy in Satan who is my saviour:Because he who is mighty, he who is the highest andineffable King of Hell, has wrought for me his wonders.The Priest faces the congregation.Priest:Diabolus vobiscum.Deacons:Et cum spiritu tuo.The Priest takes the host and begins the Desecration. This must be donewith anger, vehemence, wrath, and hatred. He raises the host to theBaphomet and says:- 750 -Priest:Thou, thou whom, in my quality of Priest, I force, whetherthou wilt or no, to descend into this host, to incarnate thyselfinto this bread, Jesus, artisan of hoaxes, bandit of homages,robber of affection, hear!Since the day when thou didst issue from the complaisantbowels of a virgin, thou hast failed all thy engagements,belied all thy promises. Centuries have wept, awaiting thee,fugitive god, mute god! Thou wast to redeem man, and thouhas not. Thou wast to appear in thy glory, and thou sleepest.Go, lie, say to the wretch who appeals to thee, “Hope, bepatient, suffer; the hospital of souls will receive thee; theangels will assist thee; Heaven opens to thee”. Imposter!Thou knowest well that the angels, disgusted at thy inertia,abandon thee! Thou wast to be the interpreter of our plaints,the chamberlain of our tears; thou wast to convey them tothe cosmos, and thou hast not done so, for this intercessionwould disturb thy eternal sleep of happy satiety.Thou hast forgotten the poverty thou didst preach, vassalenamoured of banquets! Thou hast seen the weak crushedbeneath the press of profit while standing by and preachingservility! Oh, the hypocrisy! That man should accept suchwoe unto himself is testimony to his blindness, that veryaffliction thou didst credit thyself to cure.Satan is my beloved master, whose inconceivable magicengenders life and bestows it on the innocent whom thevicious Jesus darest damn - in the name of what originalsin? O lasting foulness of Bethlehem, whom darest thoupunish? By the virtue of what covenants? We would havethee confess thy impudent cheats, thy inexpiable crimes! Wewould drive deeper the nails into thy hands, press down thecrown of thorns upon thy brow, bring blood and water fromthe dry wounds of thy sides. And that we can and will do byviolating the quietude of thy body, profaner of ample vices,abstractor of stupid purities, cursed Nazarene, do-nothingking, coward god!- 751 -Behold, Lord Satan, this symbol of putrid flesh which is ofhim who would purge the Earth of pleasure and who, in thename of Christian “justice”, did cause the death of millions ofour beloved brethren. We curse him and defile his name.O mighty King of Hell, condemn him to the slimy pits,evermore to suffer in unrelenting anguish. Shower thy wrathupon him, O Prince of Darkness, and rend him full asunderthat he may know thy glorious might. O god of gods, King ofthe Infernal Realm, Lord of the Earth, call forth thy legionsthat they may witness what we do in thy most glorious name.Send forth thy messengers to herald this deed and send theChristian minions reeling to their doom. Smite him, O kingof kings, that his angels and archangels, cherubim andseraphim, may cower and tremble with fear and prostratethemselves before thee in honor of thy greatness. Sendcrashing down the gates of Heaven, O true and only god, thatthe murders of our beloved forebears may be avenged. Ventthy full wrath upon him, O highest and ineffable King ofHell, that he will know that thou art truly god on high.The Priest thrusts the host into the labia of the altar, who, removing herhands from the candle holders, proceeds to masturbate herself to climax orelse, maintaining her original position, allows the Priest to masturbate her,employing the host as a device. As the Priest finishes the desecration, theDeacon lights the white candle and prepares the small incense burner onthe altar with charcoal and incense. He does not light the mixture. Then theDeacon begins a rhythmic beating of the gong while the Priest drops thehost into the small bowl and, using the pestle, proceeds to grind it into acompletely pulverized state, swearing blasphemies as he does so. TheDeacon and Sub-Deacon also swear the most vile obscenities while thePriest is grinding the host.When the host has been completely pulverized, the Priest adds it to themixture of charcoal and incense and sets it aflame using the white candle.Priest:Vanish into nothingness, thou fool of fools, thou vile androtten pretender to the throne of almighty Satan, the true- 752 -god of gods. Vanish into the void of thy empty Heaven, forthou wert never, nor shalt thou ever be.When the mixture is completely burnt, the Priest extinguishes the whitecandle and, turning to the congregation, utters the purported last words ofthat miserable swine upon the cross:Priest:Consummatum est. Shemhamforash!Deacons:Shemhamforash!Priest:Hail, Satan!Deacons:Hail, Satan!The Priest takes the sword and calls forth the Four Princes of Hell in themanner set forth in the Satanic Bible, that they may bear witness to theConsecratio.Priest:Satan! Come forth from thy realm, Satan, and appear. Befriendly unto me, for I am the same: the true worshipper ofthe highest and ineffable King of Hell.Lucifer! Come forth from thy realm, Lucifer, and appear. Befriendly unto me, for I am the same: the true worshipper ofthe highest and ineffable King of Hell.Belial! Come forth from thy realm, Belial, and appear. Befriendly unto me, for I am the same: the true worshipper ofthe highest and ineffable King of Hell.Leviathan! Come forth from thy realm, Leviathan, andappear. Be friendly unto me, for I am the same: the trueworshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell.Shemhamforash! Hail Satan!- 753 -ConsecratioThe Deacon begins to disrobe the Priest with great ceremony. As eachvestment is removed, the Sub-Deacon says:Sub-Deacon: We remove this chasuble from thee, O servant of the Princeof Darkness, and cast it in a heap, that thou mayst be freedfrom this symbol of Christian infamy which bears the bloodof murdered millions of our brethren.We remove this stole from thee, O servant of the Prince ofDarkness, as it is a symbol of the immortality of thatheinous, bloodstained dog who dares pretend to thy throne,that thou mayest be freed from this symbol of Christianinfamy which bears the blood of murdered millions of ourbrethren.We remove this maniple from thee, O servant of the Princeof Darkness, as it is a symbol of the tears shed for that foulfiend who dares to pretend to Satan’s throne, that thoumayest be freed of this symbol of Christian infamy whichbears the blood of murdered millions of our brethren.We remove this girdle from thee, O servant of the Prince ofDarkness, as it is a symbol of the purity of him who was bornof the lustful passion of the maniacal Joseph and the sex-crazed Mary who did fornicate, even as you and I, and whoseseeds became as one to form the putrid body of him whodares to pretend to Satan’s throne, that thou mayest be freedof this symbol of Christian infamy which bears the blood ofmurdered millions of our brethren.We remove this alb from thee, O servant of the Prince ofDarkness, as it is a symbol of the cleansing of the souls ofChristian minions yet serves as naught but a cover for a bodybetter used in lust, that thou mayest be freed of this symbolof Christian infamy which bears the blood of murderedmillions of our brethren.- 754 -Now completely disrobed, the Priest stands naked before the altar, armsraised in triumph.Priest:Glory be to thee, O lord of lords, true god of gods, highestand ineffable King of Hell. I give thee thanks for thy greatglory and refresh myself in nakedness before thy sight.Boldly I beseech thee: Shower thy bounties upon this, thyservant, and fill my rod with the fire of passion, evermore toserve thee in all thou dost command. Forsake me not, Omighty Prince of Darkness, for I am of thee and by thee,forsaking all other gods; for thou art my god, the true giverof life.The Deacon brings forth the Mantle of Darkness, a hooded black robe,which he places upon the Priest with great ceremony, covering his headwith the hood.Sub-Deacon: O mighty Prince of Darkness, recognize this, thy servant,upon whose shoulders we place this sacred robe, andthrough whom we offer up this sacrifice to thy great glory.Priest:Gratia tibi, fratres.The Priest masturbates in the darkness of his cloak until he reaches anejaculation. The semen is caught in a deep silver spoon and placed upon thealtar. The Deacon offers the Priest a towel to cleanse himself, after which hebegins the second Offertorium.OffertoriumPriest:(Eccl. 24, 25, 39) In me gratia omnis viæ et veritatis. In meomnis spes vitæ et virtutis: Ego quasi rosa plantata superrivos aquarum fructificavi.The Priest calls upon Satan to come forth and bless the sacrificial offeringby reciting the Veni.- 755 -VeniPriest:Veni sanctificator, omnipotens, æterne Diabolus, et benedichoc sacrificium, tuo Inferno nomine præparatum.The Priest raises the spoon slightly before him.Priest:O mighty Satan, highest and ineffable King of Hell, acceptthis sacrificial offering of the living flesh which I, thy devotedservant, make to thee and which from my own lustful rod didcome.The Priest raises the spoon on high to the Baphomet, and the Deaconstrikes the gong.Priest:Hic est enim corpus meum.Taking the Chalice from the altar, the Priest goes to the Epistle side of thealtar. The Deacon pours wine from the cruet into the Chalice of Ecstasy.The Priest returns to the center of the altar and raises the Chalice slightlybefore him.Priest:We offer thee, O lord of lords, this Chalice of Ecstasy whichcontains the elixir of life and does stir the desires of the flesh,and which brings forth the lustful bounties of thy Infernalkingdom. Unto thy wisdom do we commend ourselves. Untothy mercies are we forever bound.The Priest raises the Chalice on high to the Baphomet, and the Deaconstrikes the gong.Priest:Hic est enim Calix Ecstaticus.The Priest sets the Chalice upon the altar.Priest:It is through thee that all these good gifts, created so by thee,are by thee sanctified, endowed with life, and bestowed uponus. Let us praise our lord. Urged by Satan’s bidding andschooled by his ordinance, we make bold to say:- 756 -Our father, which art in Hell, glory to thy name. Thykingdom is come. Thy will is done, on Earth as it is in thyInfernal realm. Grant us this day the bounties of thykingdom, and give us our trespasses lest others trespassagainst us, and lead us into temptation.Deacons:But deliver us not from evil.The Priest takes the spoon in his hand.Priest:Deliver us, we pray thee, Lord Satan, unto every evil, past,present, and yet to come; and at the intercessions of all theDæmons of the Pit, and of Pan and Ishtar, be pleased togrant us fulfillment of all our desires; so that with themanifold blessing of thy compassion, we may be ever free tosin.The Priest pours the semen into the Chalice of Ecstasy.Priest:Through thee, O god of gods, thou, who art my god, do wefind unity and comfort with our Satanic brothers. Per omniasæcula sæculorum.Deacons:Alleluja! Alleluja!The Priest faces the congregation.Priest:Pax Diaboli sit semper vobiscum.Deacons:Et cum spiritu tuo.The Priest turns to face the altar.Priest:May this mingling of the living seed of life with the contentsof this Chalice of Ecstasy be for us who receive it a source ofeternal strength.The Priest turns to the Deacon and gives him the kiss of brotherhood.- 757 -Priest:Pax tecum.Deacon:Et cum spiritu tuo.The Deacon turns to the Sub-Deacon and gives him the kiss of brotherhood.Deacon:Pax tecum.Sub-Deacon: Et cum spiritu tuo.The Priest takes the Chalice in his hands.Priest:O mighty Satan, this living seed and Elixir of Life be ever as atribute to thy most glorious name.The Priest drinks the entire contents of the Chalice. He then returns to theEpistle side of the altar, where the Deacon refills the Chalice with wine. ThePriest returns to the center of the altar, where, after offering the Chalice tothe Baphomet, offers it first to the Deacon and then to the Sub-Deacon,who drain the contents. The Communion thus completed, the Priest raiseshis arms to the Sigil of Baphomet in the Sign of the Horns.Priest:That which our mouths have taken, lord god of gods, highestand ineffable King of Hell, may we possess in lustfulness ofmind and purpose; and may the gift of the moment becomefor us an everlasting remedy.The Priest places the veil over the Chalice of Ecstasy. He turns to face thecongregation.Priest:Diabolus vobiscum.Deacons:Et cum spiritu tuo.The Priest reads the invocation for lust from the Satanic Bible, concludingwith -Priest:Shemhamforash!- 758 -Deacons:Shemhamforash!Priest:Hail, Satan!Deacons:Hail, Satan!The Priest blesses the altar to indicate the closing of the Missa Solemnis.He turns to the congregation for the final blessing. He raises his arms in theSign of the Horns, and all respond.Priest:Benedicat vos omnipotens Diabolus et pax suam sit sempervobiscum.The Deacon takes the Missale from the center of the altar, raises it to theBaphomet, and then moves it to the Gospel side for the Last Gospel, theFifteenth Enochian Key.The Last GospelPriest:Sequentia sancti evangelii secundum sancta biblia nostræ.The Priest recites the Enochian and then the English versions of theFifteenth Enochian Key. The Priest then rings the bell the prescribed ninetimes as a pollutionary.Priest:So it is done.The Deacon takes the sword from the altar and leads the procession out ofthe ritual chamber, followed by the Priest carrying the Chalice and the Sub-Deacon carrying the Missale.- 759 -Appendix 8: Requirements for the Satanic Clergy- by Anton Szandor LaVeyMany members of the Church of Satan have expressed the desire tomove deeper into Satanic theology and also have inquired about therequirements for the Satanic Priesthood.Aside from those posts on the governing board of the Church of Satan,there are two other positions towards which the serious student of Satanictheology may aspire. These are the Satanic ministry and the SatanicPriesthood.Satanic ministers are those who have studied the Satanic doctrinessufficiently to be capable of speaking to groups of people and enlighteningthem in all areas of the Satanic religion. A Satanic Priest is required to carryout the same duties as a minister, but in addition must have the ability toorganize and act as director of a branch of the Church.Our ministers and Priests fall into two categories: the “undergroundclergy” and the “free agents”. The underground clergymen are thoseindividuals who, due to professional positions, public images, family ties,etc. are unable to make publicly known their standing with the Church.Usually this type of person works with an associate who is able to carry on“aboveground”. The members of the clergy who need not conceal theirpositions with the Church and who, as a matter of fact, often use theirpositions to open doors which would otherwise be closed to them, are calledfree agents. Both types of clergymen are essential to our sound Churchstructure.Until the release of the Satanic Bible, anticipant clergy are required toreside in San Francisco for a period of one month, during which he (or she)would attend classes and services, thereby becoming familiar with some ofthe various rituals performed and broadening his knowledge of the Satanicsciences.After the Satanic Bibl e is released [this fall], an examination will becompiled concerning the contents of same. This will possibly enable us toshorten the required stay in San Francisco. Although correct completion ofthe examination will indicate a relatively good knowledge of Satanism, apersonal interview with the Council will be required.If the person is deemed acceptable by the Council, a one to three week[depending upon the individual’s aptitude] program of personal seminarialtraining will be scheduled. The position, minister or Priest, is determined- 760 -by the Council, who base their judgment on the abilities and personality ofthe individual concerned.The seminarial training period is culminated by a graduationceremony, after which the graduate is initiated into the Black Order - thetraditional hierarchy of Satanism. Graduates receive a diploma signifyingthat they have fulfilled all requirements for their position and stating theirdegree and title. The Church of Satan is the only officially recognizedorganization of its kind qualified to ordain others as Satanic ministers andPriests.Lest you presume that members of the Satanic clergy must be formallyschooled in higher education or occult matters, we hasten to assure you thatwe are far more concerned with such qualities as sincere dedication to ourdoctrines, appropriate personality, common sense, practical skills,versatility, scrupulous character, etc. than we are with formal degrees oroccult knowledge. Of course individuals with college educations have thatmuch more in their favor, but unless they possess the other qualities listedabove (which we feel are more important by far), they would not be eligiblefor an office in the Satanic clergy.If you are interested in elevating yourself to the position of minister orPriest, we would welcome a letter or call from you.The Church of Satan- 761 -Appendix 9: The Satanic Ultimatum- by Michael A. Aquino I°Introduction - LegacySo numerous are the anthologies concerning the history of the BlackArts that it would be pointless to review this ground, and indeed it is apractical impossibility to distinguish fact from fantasy in such anundertaking. Since it is our intent to present an argument, questionableassertions will be avoided wherever possible. Whether the sorcerers ofantiquity actually performed the wondrous feats attributed to them isimmaterial to the direction of our immediate concern. More pertinent iswhether these magicians either intentionally or accidentally discovered andput into practice valid principles of psychological influence insufficientlyexplored in other areas of human endeavor.In his famous treatise on magic The Golden Bough, Sir James GeorgeFrazier suggests the basic interrelationship of magic, religion, and science:In magic, man depends upon his own strength. He believes in a certainestablished order of nature on which he can surely count and which he canmanipulate for his own ends. When he recognizes that both the order ofnature and the control which he had believed himself to exercise over it arepurely imaginary, he ceases to rely upon his own intelligence and his ownunaided efforts and throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain greatinvisible beings behind the veil of nature to whom he now ascribes all of thosefar-reaching powers which he once abrogated to himself.But this explanation in its turn proves to be unsatisfactory, for it assumesthat the succession of natural events is not determined by immutable laws, butis to some extent variable and irregular; and this assumption is not borne out.Thus the keener minds come to reject the religious theory of nature asinadequate, and to revert in a measure to the older standpoint of magic bypostulating explicitly what in magic had been only implicitly assumed, to wit:an inflexible regularity in the order of natural events.Significantly, while Frazier suggests that the further distinctionbetween magic and science is that the former is inductive while the latter isdeductive, he passes no judgment upon the validity of one over the other,noting that, while the so-called scientific laws of nature establish a meansfor predicting future events on the evidence of past ones, they do not graspeffectively at the essence of things - a facet of scientific research of which- 762 -every true scientist is uncomfortably aware [and one reason why religionand science are not mutually exclusive].Frazier’s inductive process - magic - is easily the most attractive of thethree systems. Unlike the other two it suggests that man in fact exerts anelemental control over his environment. He is a source from which hisenvironment derives and to whose will it is just as intrinsically subject.It is thus noteworthy that man conceded his evident weaknesses with illgrace. When men began to turn from primitive magic to the early forms ofreligion, their leaders were still held to possess either natural magicalpowers, or a definite influence with the gods who wielded these powers. TheEgyptian pharaohs were accorded divine status, the Aztec and Chineseemperors ruled by virtue of heavenly mandates, and even Europe was notquick to reject the theory of the “divine right” of kings.In some societies the secular ruler also represented the deity, but atrend generally occurred towards separate orders of priesthood whoseinfluence in matters of state occasionally surpassed that of the titular ruler.In modern societies this dichotomy has evolved in two major directions:first, the eventual legal separation of church and state, and second, thegradual assumption of quasi-governmental status by such powerfulchurches as the Roman Catholic, the Jewish, the Islamic, and the Buddhist.The increasing institutionalization of religion brought a lowering in thestatus of the individual believer. Whereas the origins of religion had comethrough the general desire of the populace to secure divine blessings andbenefits, the priest-orders were quick to realize that, as the mouthpieces oftheir gods, they could in fact control the behavior of the people. In the moreliberal religions this was justified as being in the popular interest, but itwasa subtle form of government nevertheless. It was this “creeping theocracy”that so incensed Friedrich Nietzsche in Twilight of the Idols and TheAntichrist. He saw in it not only the subjugation of man’s physical freedom,but of his intellectual freedom as well. Yet so accustomed to living underthe drug of religion had man become by Nietzsche’s time that the freedomadvocated by the philosopher was practically incomprehensible. Nietzsche,intending to deal the institution of the church a mortal blow, found that noone else was interested. The depth of his frustration can only be guessed at,but it is perhaps significant that he died after a subsequent decline intomadness.Since the oppressive effects of even partial theocracies were not to befought by a rejection of religion in its entirety - such a radical concept beingtoo formidable for a general population to embrace - the theory of internal- 763 -antithesis presented itself as a ready alternative. Dæmons who representedthe rejected modes of behavior were derived from the gods of a crushedrival religion, or they could be created anew by the established religion toserve as personified objects of hatred. There is perhaps more truth thanirony in the historic application of the term “scapegoat” to the Archfiend.Dæmons and devils exist in a number of religious systems and sects,but for our purposes the mythological symbolisms have been adopted fromJudæo-Christian backgrounds. The figure of Lucifer or Satan is well-known, and the cults that have arisen to champion this figure have, over aperiod of centuries, contributed such a lore as to qualify Satanism as areligion in its own right - save for two complicating factors: First, primitiveSatanism was highly disorganized and spontaneous. And second, thepresently-emerging form of Satanism disavows the traditional theocraticprinciples of the established religions.It is now necessary to venture into the methodology of the newSatanism before discussing its ambitions.Part I - MeansA. White Magic - Mask of ImitationSummarily defined, White Magic is magic employed for altruistic,beneficent, or informational purposes. Within its areas of concern aretheatrical magicians, palmists, crystal gazers, astrologers, Christian-relatedsocieties which employ ceremonial magic and, not infrequently, theinstitutional churches themselves. There are also a number of White Magicsocieties in evidence whose “White witches” seek the notoriety of the occultwithout caring to commit their sincere efforts to the greater philosophiessuggested therein.The spells of the White magician are supposedly harmless to the soul ofthe practitioner. Astrology, for instance, carries no stigma in mostorganized religions. And even the more extreme forms of White “hex”Magic supposedly employ only untainted spirits in their execution. WhiteMagic more or less attracts those people whose fascination with theromantic reputation of the occult is tempered by a strong conditioning ofestablished religion. White Magic, furthermore, is a respectable hobby; auniversity professor or a business executive may study the subject withoutprovoking serious social criticism. From the standpoint of the social norm,then, White Magic is a harmless eccentricity, a form of heathen diversion- 764 -that poses no real danger to the order of living. It is certainly not to beconsidered anything of major consequence, and it is hardly to be includedin the great accomplishments of mankind save as a remnant of ancientsuperstitions.B. Black Magic - Exploration of EssenceBlack Magic might be said to be the Satanic “infinitive”: Satanism inpractice. To define this subject material strictly in terms of classic occultismwould be a serious injustice, though, since even the simplest premises ofBlack Magic lead to a vast number of theological hypotheses. How then toessentialize Black Magic?Black Magic is an attitude of observation and conduct in which theabsolute potential of the human intellect is assumed and all avenues for theexercise of this potential are sought. Let us break this definition down intoits component parts. Black Magic - or Satanism - is not an “object” in itself;it is not an absolute to which one aspires, for there is no single goal inevidence. It is an attitude alone, a continuous process of training thepersonality to view stimuli empirically. While scientific laws are useful inunderstanding the natural systems of the Universe, they are not essential inthemselves. The fact that gravity has existed for ten billion years in no wayguarantees its continuation an instant from now.It is both a system of observation and a guide for conduct. The Satanistmust be receptive to his environment to the greatest possible degree if he isto reason in logical directions. The Satanist must be sensitive to essence;and the active correlation - conduct - is just as important. Themisinterpretation of information may lead not only to wrong conclusionsbut, more insidiously, to incomplete conclusions. This is not to say that agood Satanist must know everything there is to know or be an intellectualwashout. Rather he must be so selective in his beliefs and conclusions thatthe chance of error is infinitely small, and what he cannot measure by thisstrict rule must be classified as essentially unknown.The potential of the human intellect is not as difficult to define as it isto reach. It is, according to Satanic axiom, infinite. There is no definitelimitto what the mind can accomplish, whether it be ESP, teleportation,transformation, prolongation of life [and even the elimination of death], orthe spontaneous creation of matter/energy from nothingness. In a religiouscontext the Satanic man is potentially divine.- 765 -And finally this mandate must be exercised. Potential by itself isworthless unless it is pursued and actualized. The Satanist has visions ofwhat he may become, and he is thus charged to attempt these visions. If hisachievements are contributive to any degree, the ultimate glory will be asmuch his as that of the final and complete Satanist.And now what are the systems of Black Magic? How has it served in thepast, and how may it presently be employed? Discarding for the momentthe accusations of past fanatics, we will claim for our predecessors the titleof the truly free. The Black Magicians of history defied not only secularinfringements on their conduct and attitudes, but moral imposition as well.By flaunting their will in the very face of the god whom they had beentaught to regard as omnipotent, they endangered - or sacrificed - their soulsin order that they might glory in the indulgence of their desires.Satanism as an infant art had limited goals and a limited philosophy.Sexual license, wealth, physical or political power, or control over specificinstances of life or death were the general concerns; and the personalities ofthe dæmons invoked were designed accordingly. Because it did not occur tothese first Satanists that Satan himself might be an absolute contradictionof the Christian god, he “required” worship, levied “tribute” (in the form ofsouls), and extracted various abasements from his devotees in return for hisdiabolical patronage. The ultimate possibilities of Satanism, however, wereoccasionally hinted at by both Satanists and Christians alike. At the verybeginning of the Christian Bible, the Satanic influence of the serpent temptsman to the attainment of judgment and knowledge - a development whichprompts divine punishment lest man subsequently aspire to divine status.This episode is a curious one, even from an allegorical standpoint, for itsmoral message seems to be that knowledge is intrinsically harmful andmust be curtailed. It also follows that the Christian man may expect toachieve Heaven only when he has purged himself of his intellect - anextraordinary precept upon which to initiate man’s most influentialreligious code, surely - but it is valuable in defining the primary issuebetween conventional religions and Satanism. Further biblical referenceswould serve only to reemphasize this basic issue. These oddly-paradoxicalpassages are easily found. And if it is surprising that such extreme attacksupon the personality of man should be mounted at all, let the reader ponderthe amazing degree to which this repressive doctrine has been not onlyaccepted but enthusiastically embraced. One is moved to suggest thatChristianity is an institution dedicated to the obliteration of the self.- 766 -A more positive tone may be found in the works of John Milton,specifically in his epic poem Paradise Lost. Herein Lucifer rejects the singlecondition set upon his Archangelic rank - that he acknowledge the will ofGod to be supreme in all things - and elects the bitterness of Hell in orderthat he may achieve self-actualization. “Better,” he decides, “to reign in Hellthan serve in Heaven.” The implication is that the rejection of mindlessnirvana brings one into abrupt and crushing contact with the almostendless obstacles which must be overcome in the search for pureknowledge. The Miltonian Lucifer is, in fact, our Satanic man.The latter portion of the epic, which is concerned with Satan’sintellectual “contamination” of man, has traditionally been interpretedfrom a Christian standpoint. But the Satanist views this encounter rather asevidence of Satan’s desire to free the mind of man from its unknowndeprivation. Milton was hardly in a position to champion the Devil outright- Cromwellian England was not known for its religious license - but it is allthe greater tribute to his poetic genius that his ultimate message wasundistorted.The ceremonial aspect of Black Magic has elicited constant romanticappeal, being the subject of many horror stories and theatrical melodramas.In such context Satanism is usually portrayed as being a grotesque mockeryof “good” Christian ritual - the Black Mass, for instance, with its invertedcross and other parodies of Catholicism. What is not conveyed, however, isthat parody occupies a major role in Satanic methodology. Thepsychological intent of ceremonies, basically, is twofold: first to inspire awe(or, in more primitive instances, fear), and second to clothe relatedpronouncements in a supernatural dignity which would not be forthcomingoutside of a ceremonial setting.To the new Satanist Black Magical ceremonies may seem only todisplace the old Christian symbolisms with a new order. It is this transitoryimpression which inspires the superficially macabre rituals of popularfiction, but the final intent of Satanic ceremonies is considerably moresophisticated: It is to purge man of the artificially-induced disposition tovacate his sense of reason under ceremonial circumstances. The ultimateSatanist has no subjective interest in ceremony; it is valuable only as anobjective device to eliminate the fear of unreason in new initiates and tocheck, through the use of superstition, attacks by conventional religionupon the Satanic Church.Satanic ceremonies, summarily, are designed to exert a desiredinfluence on the beholder, although different persons may form different- 767 -interpretations of a given ceremony. Ceremonial magic’s effectiveness isdirectly proportional to the susceptibility of its subjects. Hence it is a mostpowerful tool against both conventional religion and White Magicalorganizations. Since organized religion is largely dependent upon fear as amotivating factor - Timor Fecit Deos: fear created the gods (Petronius) -fear can be used against the conventional churches whenever it is deemednecessary. Under such circumstances, though, the Satanist is charged toobserve a most important axiom: that the power of Black Magic beemployed ultimately as a protective and educational device only. Its use asa technique of intellectual tyranny would be nothing more than a parallel ofthe Christian ethic and thus a serious disservice to the values of Satanism.In a casual discussion of the powers of Black Magic one may be askedwhether the art permits one to fly, become invisible, etc. Such questionsalmost always indicate a superficial impression of Black Magic, but acapsule answer may be given under appropriate circumstances. It isimportant to establish that Black Magic is subjective, i.e. it manipulatesintellects, not insensate objects. Through mental suggestion Black Magiccan create the impression of flight, and - since reality in the precise sense issubjective to the Satanist - flight occurs. There is no Satanic reality beyondthe mind: As you think and as you perceive, so you are.It should now be obvious that the student of Black Magic confrontsdifficulties unmatched in any other field of endeavor. He has, in truth,undertaken to demonstrate that nothing is impossible - a somewhatambitious task. And even the evaluation of his progress is necessarilysubjective.A final word might be added concerning the personification of theDevil. Lucifer (“Lightgiver”) or Satan (“Adversary”) is an all-inclusivesymbol of the ideal that bears his name. Does he exist in the sense that hemay materialize in the midst of a magic circle, breathing fire and reeking ofsulfur? Once more the answer is to be found in the subjective substance ofBlack Magic. If your will is strong enough and you require a physicalmanifestation of either Satan or another citizen of the InfernalDæmonocracy, then you most certainly will obtain your desire. “Those whoseek shall find.”C. Red MagicIn ancient times the term “Red Magic” was occasionally given to themost exalted form of the magical art, and so it is applied here. The Red- 768 -Magician, therefore, may be described as the hypothetical ultimateSatanist: the Black Magician evolved to infinity. When one has masteredinfinity, then - recalling that Black Magic is a technique for achieving theimpossible - one is in fact a master of subjective existence: a Red Magician.The Red Magician and Satan have become one.D. Psychic Science - Cult of UnreasonThe popular mind has long linked Black Magic to that bewilderingmaze of phenomena concerned with spiritual mediums, seances, hauntings,poltergeists, ectoplasm, and table-tapping. It is high time that thisconnection be most decisively severed. The Satanist has no use for illusions.He is a realist - a relentless, absolute realist. When he desirescommunication with an Infernal personage, he establishes it immediatelyand effectively - without closing curtains, dimming lights, holding hands, orotherwise wasting time and insulting the intelligence. ESP may be one ofhis tools, but it is not an object of awe or reverence.As to the multitudes of mystics who enthusiastically pursue “psychicscience’s” fantasies, the Satanist disavows their childishness withperemptory impatience. To him, phenomena whose causes are notimmediately understood are objects for future examination, not blinddevotion. And it is inconceivable that he should tolerate the psychologicaldisadvantage at which all mediums require their customers to be placed.The sheer numbers of the “psychic scientists” lend a semblance of truthto their enterprises. But the Satanist must view the question from anempirical standpoint and reject all claims which he cannot seedemonstrated under circumstances of his own choosing.Part II - EndsA. The Religious EnvironmentNo greater error could be made by the self-proclaimed Satanist than toassume that by retreating into an instantly-subjective existence he hasfulfilled his charge. There is no value in a philosophy if it is notconstructive, and the true Satanist assumes for himself - not to theSatanic Church - an obligation to free his fellow kind from their conditionedmindlessness. Satanism is an individual-oriented creed, and individualityexists since other individuals exist as a point of distinction. One’s- 769 -achievement of a strong individuality, therefore, is a relativeaccomplishment.Because of this relationship the Satanic ideal can be proven onlyagainst a reference point which is likewise perfect and ultimate. Let us tryto couch this in simpler language: I cannot know when I have attainedperfection except through reference to a number of indicators which I haveset for myself. This value system is arbitrary; I have created it not fromthe reference point of perfection itself, but from the reference point of theimperfections of humanity. I can achieve an absolute state of Satanicperfection only when this concept of the negative standard has beensuperseded by the final standard of perfection: the assumption of the RedMagician.To eliminate the concept of the negative standard, I must honestlyconclude that mankind has been “given the apple” and all accorded theopportunity to investigate the Satanic ideal for themselves. While I have noresponsibility or right to control another’s will, I can assist him to freehimself from what we mutually perceive as inhibition. Only then am I trulyfree to define my own state in an absolute, not a comparative sense.I reject the suggestion that I am my brother’s keeper, but I recognizethat his enslavement is, by implication, an infringement upon my ownproclaimed ideal of absolute freedom. The established institutions ofreligion are among these infringements and are therefore quite worthy ofdissolution. Not destruction from without - for force cannot substitute forreason under our ethic - but evolutionary dissolution from within as theSatanic manifesto is gradually proclaimed for what it truly represents formankind. And what are the stages in the process?First - the crushing of the religious object. “God” - not his churches -must be openly and deliberately attacked. He must be decisively thrustdown in every area in which his power has been proclaimed. And finally hemust be destroyed. The first war between Lucifer and the Christian godbrought the birth of reason; the second will herald its triumph.Second - the fragmentation of the god-churches. The repeateddemonstrations of “God’s” impotence will themselves be a divisiveinfluence. But so is the structure of conventional religion designed thatopen attack upon the several churches would act to strengthen themthrough the process of martyrdom. Rather the churches themselves mustbe inspired to cause their own downfall through dissension,disillusionment, and constant exposure to the temptations of Satanism. Theshock of the entire process may well be extreme, and it is an additional- 770 -responsibility of the Satanist to employ his art of reason to minimize thepsychological trauma of religious disorientation upon the social norm. Itmust be remembered that mindless, hysterical chaos is as contrary to theSatanic ideal as is blind obedience.And third - the organizational decentralization of the Satanic Churchas a theological and philosophical instrument. The advent of the SatanicAge will see man acknowledged as his own ultimate instrument, andLucifer, Lightgiver, as his symbol of glory.B. The Political EnvironmentPolitics is a process of control and order. Satanism advocates self-actualization and individual indulgence. The two cannot coexist if aconfrontation is forced, yet such a contest need not be called.An ordered society is the most advantageous environment forSatanism’s initial development, as well as being a protective shield againstpreemptive reaction by the adherents of the conventional religions. And itmay well be that the advantages of man’s legal systems far outweigh theirdisadvantages, for man has reached a point where his highest materialachievements must come from concerted effort, not from individual genius.Certain elements must eventually be extracted from governmentalsystems. The imposition of morality, for example, attacks the basicpremises of Satanism. Since it is not a necessary component of a legally-based system, it will be eliminated. The Satanic state, in its ideal form, willneither help nor hinder citizens’ individual progress. Instead it will serve asan essentially mechanical device for intracommunication, coordination ofeffort, and perpetuation of achievement. One does not “lead” a Satanist.One can only assist him in achieving the goals he has set for himself.C. The Philosophical EnvironmentOnly one other social reformist philosophy ever called in advance for itsown eventual de-institutionalization, and communism’s “temporary”dictatorship of the proletariat has evidenced no real desire to conform toMarx’ design. If it is indeed true, as George Orwell postulated in 1984, thatno man ever seizes power with the intent of relinquishing it - the object ofpower being power - upon what base can Satanism presume to rest that willpreclude its possible distortion and misuse by a Satanic “Lenin”?- 771 -The answer should be evident: Satanism is a philosophy of theindividual, not of the group. The Satanic Priest does not rule or ordain inthe name of Lucifer. He is rather an intellectual gadfly in the most excellentSocratic tradition. He challenges, he tests; he is a “Devil’s advocate” amongmen. His strength is not measured against his fellow men, but with them.By accepting the title of Priest, he has identified himself as a Satanicextrovert, one whose personal realization of the Satanic ideal is to be foundby interaction with others as a counselor and intellectual sparring partner.Factionalization of Satanism is not a realistic consideration, since Satanismfrom the outset is possessed of as many factions as it has advocates. Theprospect of a “Satanic tyrant” is ultimately ridiculous by definition.ConfrontationThis, then, is the Satanic Ultimatum - our manifesto, our dedication.The hand of Lucifer is offered: Will you take it?- 772 -- 773 -Appendix 10: Satanic Bible Introduction- by Michael A. Aquino IV°[This introduction appeared in the hardcover Satanic Bible from its firstrelease in 1972 throughout its existence, and in the Avon paperback editionfrom 1972 to 1976.]Each successive era of man’s cultural and ethical development hasupraised its literary manifesto - an argument challenging existing normsand proposing a novel approach to the enduring issues of civilization. It hasnot infrequently been the case that the realities of political nationalismhave been blended with the idealisms of extranational emphasis to producewhat we now cautiously term existentialism. Pertinent works might includethe Republic of Plato, the Politics of Aristotle, Machiavelli’s Prince, and thewritings of Nietzsche, Hobbes, Locke, Marx, and Sartre.This is the book of our era.The dawn of the Satanic Age was celebrated on April 30, 1966 - theYear One. On that date Anton Szandor LaVey consecrated the Church ofSatan in the city of San Francisco and assumed office as its first High Priest.What had begun several years earlier as an intellectual forum dedicated tothe investigation and application of the Black Arts has since expanded intoan international philosophical movement of the first magnitude. Satanism,once the isolate province of furtive outcasts and radical eccentrics, has nowbecome a serious alternative to the doctrines of theism and materialism. Inits championship of indulgence instead of abstinence, the Church of Satanrejects the notion that man’s progress is contingent upon his acceptance ofa self-imposed morality. Sound judgment derives from the comparison andresolution of opposites, Satanists maintain, and one cannot presume tojustice by honoring a single standard of behavior.An empirical approach to morality is not a recent innovation; suchtheorists as Pythagoras, Hegel, Spencer, and Compte advanced the originalpropositions for man’s intellectual independence from the natural order.And, though this concept has invariably provoked adverse reaction fromsociety-oriented institutions, it is not an insubstantial viewpoint. One needonly consider the spasmodic cataclysms of history to see how inadequatelyHomo sapiens cooperates with his fellows.By itself, however, all theory is inconsequential. Until now the onlyadvocates of a subjective morality were professorial abstractionists and -occasionally - the scattered and disorganized devotees of the traditional- 774 -“White” witchcraft. Indeed the latter have enjoyed some notoriety of late, astheir supposed proclamation of a liberal morality tempered by socialcorrectness appeals to the bored but timid dilettante. Such aficionados ofthe occult profess a righteous horror of Black Magic or Satanism, whichthey denounce as a maleficent, degenerate creature of moral and carnalabuse.The Satanist, on the other hand, regards traditional witchcraft asmerely a neurotic reaction against the established religions of the parentculture. The worship of any deity or deities - under any guise whatsoever -is repulsive to the Black Magician, who considers all protestations of faithor trust in a supernatural protectorate to be humiliating demonstrations ofcowardice and emotional insecurity. Satanism has been frequentlymisrepresented as “devil worship”, when in fact it constitutes a clearrejection of all forms of worship as a desirable component of thepersonality. It is not so much an anti-religion - a simple rebuttal of any onebelief - as it is an un-religion, an uncompromising dismissal of allinsubstantial mysticism. As such it represents a far more serious threat toorganized theologies than do the archaic customs of the old dæmonologies.Ritual and fantasy play a very real part in the activities of the SatanicChurch, on the assumption that the experience and control of mental andmetaphysical irrationality are necessary for the strengthening of the psyche.Thus a distinct effort is made to avoid what was perhaps the Achilles’ heelof the Gurdjieff-Ouspensky school of subjective psychological evolution;earlier disciples of self-determined transcendentalism postulated that allnon-materialistic sensations were a danger to the coherence of the student.Crucial to the concept of Satanic ritual is an appreciation of its illustrativeand inspirational qualities without necessarily regarding it as inflexiblereality.Satanism is more accurately identified as a disposition than as areligion, as it is actively concerned with all the facets of human existence,not with only the so-called spiritual aspects. Yet those who proclaim it to bea danger to justice and cooperative order have missed the point entirely.Satanism advocates unrestricted freedom, but only to the extent that one’spreferences do not impinge upon another’s. It should also be noted thatSatanism is a philosophy of the individual, not of the mass. There are nocollective policy statements save the famous Crowley admonition: “Self-deceit is the gravest of all ‘sins’.”While the majority of the populace may instinctively incline to a defacto Satanism, the Church cautions that its propositions are not for the- 775 -irresponsible. There are no Satanic missionaries, and to affiliate one mustmeet exacting standards. Inexperience is not dishonored, butpretentiousness, hypocrisy, and pomposity are treated with the scorn thatthey deserve. Satanism is no less an art than it is a science, and there is “nostandard of measurement deified”.Dr. LaVey is uniquely prepared to author the new Diabolism. AnAmerican of Georgian, Alsatian, and Romanian Gypsy descent, he wasquick to display the characteristic restlessness of his nomadic ancestors andan unusual empathy for their earthy, arcane lore. An early preoccupationwith the military sciences led him to read the various logistical publicationsof the World War II era, only to discover that the proud visions of martialglory entertained in the first world war had given way to a detached,mercenary realism in the second. His experiences as a student did nothingto dispel this first taste of human cynicism, and LaVey’s growingimpatience with the sterile regimentation of conventional education drovehim to seek the strange, surrealistic enchantments of the circus. He assistedClyde Beatty as a wild-animal trainer, and he soon developed a strongaffinity for the cats which was to mark his personality in a most curiousmanner. All animate creatures are basically bestial, he reasoned, and eventhe most refined social orders achieve at best only a flimsy suppression ofthis innate savagery. From the circus he proceeded to a carnival, where theglitter of the performing arts was tinged with the ever-present struggle fordaily subsistence. Here LaVey worked in a pathetic but quietly dignifiedworld of misfits, sideshow freaks, and human oddities; and here he was tolearn the craft of the stage magician, whose success depends upon thecontrived distraction of the audience’s attention. With a certain grimnesshe noted the fascination with which the “normal” man regards hisdeformed comrades - a gloating satisfaction over the visiting of misfortuneupon another instead of oneself. Becoming increasingly interested in thiscruel, lycanthropic attribute of human nature, he studied criminology incollege and eventually worked with the San Francisco Police Department asa photographer.As a circus professional he had seen carnal man at his most artistic;now he was to view him at his most vicious. Three years of the gore,brutality, and abject misery that permeate the criminal subculture left himsickened, disillusioned, and angered with the rampant hypocrisy of politesociety. He turned to the pipe organ as a means of living and devoted thegreater part of his efforts to what was to become his life’s work - BlackMagic.- 776 -LaVey had long since rejected the stereotypical tracts on ceremonialsorcery as the hysterical products of medieval imaginations. The “Old Craft”with its superstitions, affected mannerisms, and infantile parlor games wasnot for him; what he sought was a metaphysical psychology that wouldapproach the intellectual man only after giving due consideration to hisbrutal, animalistic origins. And so he came at last to the Goat of Mendes.Satan is easily the most enigmatic figure in classical literature.Possessed of every conceivable wealth, and the most powerful of theArchangels, he spurned his exalted allegiance to proclaim his independencefrom all that his Heavenly patron personified. Although condemned to themost hideous of domains, a Hell totally shunned by the divinity, heembraced such privations as the burden of his intellectual prerogative. Inhis Infernal Empire one might indulge even the most extraordinary tasteswith impunity, yet amidst such wanton licentiousness the Devil maintaineda peculiar nobility. It was this elusive quality which Anton LaVeydetermined to identify.After long years of research and experiment, he pronounced theguiding principle of Satanism: that the ultimate consequence of man liesnot in unity but in duality. It is only synthesis that decides values;adherence to a single order is arbitrary and therefore insignificant.LaVey’s disturbing theories and bizarre operations of ceremonial BlackMagic eventually attracted a following of similarly minded individuals.From this first small circle the Church of Satan was to emerge, attuned toits founder’s contention that its messages would be presented mosteffectively through “nine parts social respectability to one part of the mostblatant outrage”.The social impact and spectacular growth of the Church were tobecome something of a legend in themselves, but it was an essential part ofLaVey’s convictions that the formal institution’s role was principally that ofa catalyst. Contemporary civilization has proved too interdependent topermit the luxury of monastic isolationism. Satanism must accordinglyassume a stance comprehensible to the average intellect. It was with suchintent that the Satanic Bible was conceived.The Satanic Bible is a most insidious document. One is stronglytempted to compare it with that obscure, malefic mythology The King inYellow, a psychopolitical work that supposedly drove its readers tomadness and damnation. As candid and conversational as the Satanic Biblemight seem at first glance, it is not a volume to be gently dismissed. It isvery much the product of our time, not only because such a book - together- 777 -with its author - would more than likely have been destroyed in an earlierera, but because its creation was an evolutionary inevitability.You, the reader, are about to be impaled upon the sharp horns of aSatanic dilemma. If you accept the propositions of this book, you condemnyour most cherished sanctuaries to annihilation. In return you will awaken- but only to the most fiery of Hells. Should you reject the argument, youresign yourself to a cancerous disintegration of your previouslysubconscious sense of identity. Small wonder that the Archfiend’s legacyhas won him so many bitter enemies!Whatever your decision, it can be avoided no longer. The Satanic Biblefinally articulates what man has instinctively dreaded to proclaim: that hehimself is potentially divine.- 778 -- 779 -Appendix 11: The Hidden Source of the Satanic Philosophy- by George C. Smith II°The Scroll of Set #XIII-3, June XXII/1987Reading through past issues of the Scroll of Set, I came across astatement by Susan Wylie (March/April XVI: “The Devil’s Game”): “Oneshould remember that, prior to I ÆS, there had never been anyorganization or belief structure similar to the Church of Satan.” Althoughthis was written several years ago, I must reach across the years andaddress this serious error. The implications for those of us in the Templetoday are no less severe.“I know that I am challenging the cultural tradition of two and a halfthousand years.”The speaker was not Anton LaVey. The speaker was a novelist,playwright, and philosopher, Ayn Rand. From the springboard of herfamous, best-selling novels ( The Fountainhead in 1943 and Atlas Shruggedin 1957) was created the philosophy of Objectivism, which attractedthousands of persons - myself included - who were more than “openlyhonest regarding what they believed” but studied, wrote, taught, andpracticed what they held to be the highest expression of living.Although like others I now have some obvious points of philosophicaldisagreement with Objectivism, the legacy of this enormous Satanic breakwith the past remains a fact of history that is of prime importance toSetians everywhere. To imply or state that the Church of Satan was the firstto clearly state the Satanic ethic is to ignore the continuing impact of AynRand and individualists influenced by her work such as Nathaniel Branden[ The Psychology of Self-Esteem and Honoring the Self] and Harry Browne[ How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World]. It would instead benefit us toenrich our understanding of what the Gift of Set has meant and does meanto others who preceded I ÆS.To illustrate this historical precedent, let us examine the Nine SatanicStatements in view of the Rand work Atlas Shrugged. In Galt’s speech(pages #936-993) is the written source of most of the philosophical ideasexpressed in the Satanic Bible. Here are the first clear, contemporarystatements which led to the glorification of man’s pride and the denouncingof the life-killing concept called altruism. Here also is a vindication ofrationality and the inevitable cause of the failure of the Church of Satan toencompass the needs of intelligent and curious minds.- 780 -Note that the sequential order of these Atlas Shrugged quotationsparallels the order of the Nine Satanic Statements.1. LaVey: Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence.Rand: A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the role of a sacrificialanimal seeking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving you death asyour standard. By the grace of reality and the nature of life, man - everyman - is an end in himself. He exists for his own sake, and theachievement of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose. (page940)2. LaVey: Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipedreams.Rand: My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a singleaxiom: existence exists - and in a single choice: to live. The restproceeds from these. (page 944)3. LaVey: Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit.Rand: Honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice for the sake of others,but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his refusal tosacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousnessof others. (page 945)4. LaVey: Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead oflove wasted on ingrates.Rand: To withhold your contempt from men’s vices is an act of moralcounterfeiting, and to withhold your admiration from their virtues is anact of moral embezzlement. (page 946)5. LaVey: Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek.Rand: When a man attempts to deal with me by force, I answer him byforce. (page 950)- 781 -6. LaVey: Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead ofconcern for psychic vampires.Rand: You have been using fear as your weapon, and have beenbringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality.We offer him life as his reward for accepting ours. (page 950)7. LaVey: Satan represents man as just another animal - sometimesbetter, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours - who,because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development”, hasbecome the most vicious animal of all.Rand: Damnation is the start of your morality; destruction is itspurpose, means, and end. Your code begins by damning man as evil,then demands that he practice a good which it defines as impossible forhim to practice. It demands, as his first proof of virtue, that he accepthis own depravity without proof. It demands that he start not with astandard of value but with a standard of evil, which is himself, bymeans of which he is then to define the good; the good is that which heis not. (page 951)8. LaVey: Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead tophysical, mental, or emotional gratification.Rand: What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call hisOriginal Sin? What are the evils man acquired when he fell from a statethey consider perfection? Their myth declares that he ate the fruit ofthe tree of knowledge - he acquired a mind and became a rationalbeing. It was the knowledge of good and evil; he became a moral being.He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor; he became aproductive being. He was sentenced to experience desire; he acquiredthe capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they damn himare reason, morality, creativeness, joy - all the cardinal values of hisexistence. (page 951)9. LaVey: Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as hehas kept it in business all these years.- 782 -Rand: And as he now crawls through the wreckage, groping blindly fora way to live, your teachers offer him the help of a morality thatproclaims that he’ll find no solution and must seek no fulfillment onEarth. Real existence, they tell him, is that which he cannot perceive,true consciousness is the faculty of perceiving the nonexistent - and ifhe is unable to understand it, that is the proof that his existence is eviland his consciousness impotent. (page 952)I think that most careful examinations of the Satanic Bible will showhow the Nine Satanic Statements acted as an outline for the “Book ofLucifer” essays.Anton LaVey is the Magus of the Age of Satan, and did Utter a Wordand cause a magical restructuring of the universe. As the instrument of thecreation of that Age, he is immortalized. At the same time, credit for thesource of the philosophy which he espoused must be given to Ayn Rand.Please understand that I was an Objectivist prior to joining the Churchof Satan. It was the intellectual rigor demanded by Objectivism whichenabled me to appreciate the full meaning of the Satanic Bible. At the sametime I first completed reading it, I said that here I had found Objectivismwith an open mind concerning paranormal phenomena.The importance of all this to Setians is that the foundation for thephilosophy of Satanism much more closely embraces the philosophy of theTemple of Set than the reactionary, anti-Christian Church of Satan. Furtherthe Objectivist source for the Satanic philosophy has been carefullyresearched and elaborated [sometimes refuted in part] in numerouslibertarian books and articles.To my mind, what distinguished the Temple of Set from all otherorganizations is its non-dogmatic embracing of both the rational and theintuitive, while refusing to allow the rational to be undercut. Those whoworked with the “unevolved” Church of Satan prior to X ÆS should knowthat battles were being waged in open forums against the antihuman forcesof altruism in the name of reason prior to I ÆS. These heroic efforts shouldnot be forgotten or ignored, but should be examined for additional aidsalong our path to Xeper.- 783 -Appendix 12: “The Book of Satan” from the Satanic Bible- by Ragnar Redbeard (Arthur Desmond), Might is Right, 1896Note: The following extracts are verbatim from Might is Right, and havebeen arranged in the same order as in the “Book of Satan” section of theSatanic Bible. The items in brackets were added by Anton LaVey in the placesindicated.I.In this arid wilderness of steel and stone, I raise up my voice that youmay hear. To the East and to the West I beckon. To the North and to theSouth I show a sign proclaiming: Death to the weakling, wealth to thestrong!Open your eyes that you may see, O men of mildewed minds; and listento me, ye laborious millions!For I stand forth to challenge the wisdom of the world - to interrogatethe “laws” of man and of “God”.I request reasons for your golden rule, and ask the why and whereforeof your Ten Commands.Before none of your printed idols do I bend in acquiescence, and hewho saith “thou shalt” to me is my mortal foe.I demand proof over all things and accept with reservations even thatwhich is true.I dip my forefinger in the watery blood of your impotent, madredeemer and write over his thorn-torn brow: The true prince of evil - theking of the slaves.No hoary falsehood shall be a truth to me; no cult or dogma shallencramp my pen.I break away from all conventions [that do not lead to my earthlysuccess and happiness]. Alone, untrammeled. I raise up in stern invasionthe standard of the strong.I gaze into the glassy eye of your fearsome Jehovah and pluck him bythe beard; I uplift a broad-axe and split open his worm-eaten skull.I blast out the ghastly contents of philosophic whited sepulchers andlaugh with sardonic wrath!Then, reaching up the festering and varnished facades of yourhaughtiest moral dogmas, I write thereon in letters of blazing scorn: “Loand behold, all this is fraud!”- 784 -I deny all things! I question all things!And yet! And yet!Gather around me, O ye death-defiant, and the Earth itself shall bethine, to have and to hold.II.Behold the crucifix; what does it symbolize? Pallid incompetencehanging on a tree.All ethics, politics, and philosophies are pure assumptions, built uponassumptions. They rest on no sure basis. They are but shadowy castles-in-the-air erected by day-dreamers, or by rogues, upon nursery fables. It istime they were firmly planted upon an enduring foundation. This can neverbe accomplished until the racial mind has first been thoroughly cleansedand drastically disinfected of its depraved, alien, and demoralizing conceptsof right and wrong. In no human brain can sufficient space be found for therelentless logic of hard fact, until all preexisting delusions have been finallyannihilated. Half-measures are of no avail; we must go down to the veryroots and tear them out, even to the last fibre. We must be, like nature,hard, cruel, relentless.Too long the dead hand has been permitted to sterilize living thought.Too long right and wrong, good and evil have been inverted by falseprophets. In the days that are at hand, neither creed nor code must beaccepted upon authority - human, superhuman, or “divine”. Morality andconventionalism are for subordinates. Religions and constitutions and allarbitrary principles, every mortal theorem, must be deliberately put to thequestion. No moral dogma must be taken for granted, no standard ofmeasurement deified. There is nothing inherently sacred about moralcodes. Like the wooden idols of long ago, they are all the work of humanhands; and what man has made, man can destroy.He who is slow to believe anything and everything is of greatunderstanding, for belief in one false principle is the beginning of allunwisdom. The chief duty of every new age is to upraise new men todetermine its liberties, to lead it towards material success - to rend therusty padlocks and chains of dead custom that always prevent healthyexpansion. Theories and ideals and constitutions that may have meant life,hope, and freedom for our ancestors may now mean destruction, slavery,and dishonor to us. As environments change, no human ideal standethsure.- 785 -Whenever, therefore, a lie has built unto itself a throne, let it beassailed without pity and without regret; for under the dominance of aninconvenient falsehood, no nation can permanently prosper. Letestablished sophisms be dethroned, rooted out, burnt, and destroyed - forthey are a standing menace to all true nobility of thought and action.Whatever alleged “truth” is proven by results to be but an empty fiction, let"},{"pageContent":"it be unceremoniously flung into the outer darkness, among the dead gods,dead empires, dead philosophies, and other useless lumber and wreckage.The most dangerous of all enthroned lies is the holy, the sanctified, theprivileged lie - the lie that everyone believes to be a model truth. It is thefruitful mother of all other popular errors and delusions. It is a hydra-headed. It has a thousand roots. It is a social cancer. The lie that is knownto be a lie is half-eradicated. But the lie that even intelligent persons regardas a sacred fact - the lie that has been inculcated around a mother's knee - ismore dangerous to contend against than a creeping pestilence. Popular lieshave ever been the most potent enemies of personal liberty. There is onlyone way to deal with them: Cut them out, to the very core, just as cancersare. Exterminate them root and branch, or they will surely eat us all up.Annihilate them, or they will us. Half and half remedies are of no avail.However, when a lie has gone too far - when it has taken up its abode inthe very tissues, bones, and brains of a people, then all remedies areuseless. Even the lancet is of no avail. Repentance of past misdeeds cannot“save” decadents from extermination. The fatal bolt is shot, and into thefiery furnace of wholesale slavery they must go, to be there righteouslyconsumed. From their ashes something new, something nobler, maypossibly evolve; but even that is the merest optimistic supposition.In nature the wages of sin are always death. Nature does not love thewrongdoer, but endeavors in every way to destroy him. Her curse is on thebrow of the “meek and lowly”. Her blessing is on the very heart's blood ofthe strong and the brave. Only Jews and Christs and other degeneratesthink that rejuvenation can ever come through law and prayer. “All thetears of the martyrs” might just as well have never been shed.III.“Love one another”, you say, is the supreme law. But what power hasmade it so? Upon what rational authority does the gospel of love rest? Is iteven possible of practice, and what would result from its universalapplication to active affairs? Why should I not hate mine enemies and hunt- 786 -them down like the wild beasts they are? If I “love” them, does that notplace me at their mercy? Is it natural for enemies to “do good” unto eachother? And what is “good”? Can the torn and bloody victim “love” theblood-splashed jaws that rend him limb from limb? Are we not allpredatory animals by instinct? If humans ceased wholly from preying uponeach other, could they continue to exist?[Is not “lust and carnal desire” a more truthful term to describe “love”when applied to the continuance of the race? Is not the “love” of thefawning scriptures simply a euphemism for sexual activity, or was the“great teacher” a glorifier of eunuchs?]“Love your enemies and do good to them that hate you and despitefullyuse you” is the despicable philosophy of the spaniel that rolls upon its backwhen kicked. Obey it, O reader, and you and your posterity to the tenthgeneration shall be irretrievably and literally damned. They shall be hewersof wood and carriers of water: degenerates, Gibeonites. But hate yourenemies with a whole heart. If a man smite you on one cheek, smash himdown! Smite him hip and thigh, for self-preservation is the highest law.He who turns the other cheek is a cowardly dog - a Christian dog.Give him blow for blow, scorn for scorn, doom for doom - withcompound interest liberally added thereunto! Eye for eye, tooth for tooth -aye, fourfold, a hundred-fold! Make yourself a Terror to your adversary;and when he goeth his way, he will possess much additional wisdom toruminate over. Thus shall you make yourself respected in all the walks oflife, and your spirit - your immortal spirit - shall live: not in an intangibleparadise, but in the brains and thews of your aggressive and unconquerablesons. After all, the true proof of manhood is a splendid progeny; and it is ascientific axiom that the timid animal transmits timidity to its descendants.If men lived “like brothers” and had no powerful enemies to contendwith and surpass, they would rapidly lose all their best qualities - likecertain oceanic birds that lose the use of their wings because they do nothave to fly from pursuing beasts of prey. If all men had treated each otherwith brotherly love since the beginning, what would have been the resultnow? If there had been no wars, no rivalry, no competition, no kingship, noslavery, no survival of the toughest, no racial extermination, truly what afestering “hell fenced in” this old globe would be!- 787 -IV.If this struggle is ordained of us, why not enter into it with kindlycourage, with dauntless delight? Why not go forward daring all things, toconquer or to die?Is it not better to perish than to serve? “Liberty or death” is not ameaningless phrase. No, it is of tremendous import to those who -comprehend.What is death that it should make cowards of us all? What is life that itshould be values so highly? There are worse things than death, and amongthem is a life of dishonor. All men lead dishonorable lives who serve amaster with hand or brain.Life itself is but a spark in the gloom that flashes out and disappears[1]. Why therefore not make the most of it here and now - here and now!There is no “Heaven of glory bright”, and no Hell where sinners roast.There is no Right; there is no Wrong - nor God - nor Son - nor Ghost.Death endeth all for every man.For every “son of thunder”:Then be a Lion in the path,And don't be trampled under.For us there is no rest - no Kingdom of Indolence, either on this Earthor beyond the skies - no Isles of the Blest - no Elysian Fields - no garden ofthe Hesperides. No! No! All these magical legends are but fanciful wakingdreams - fiction of mortals of yore.Here and now is our day of torment! Here and now is our day of joy!Here and now is our opportunity! Choose ye this day, this hour, for noRedeemer liveth.Every attempt made to organize the future must necessarily collapse.The present is our domain, and our chief duty is to take immediatepossession thereof upon strict business principles.Strive therefore against them that strive against you, and war againstthem that war against thine. Lay hold of shield and buckler or theirequivalents; stand up! Be a terrible one in thine own defense. Raise up alsothe clenched hand, and stop the way of them that would persecute you. Sayunto thine own heart and soul: “I, even I, am my own redeemer.”Let them be hurled back to confusion and infamy, who devise thineundoing. Let them be as chaff before the cyclone, and let the Angel of Deathpursue them, nay, overtake them. In a pit they have hidden a trap for thyfeet; into that very destruction let them fall. Then, exultant, “sound the loud- 788 -timbrel”. Rejoice! Rejoice! in thine own salvation. Then all thy bones shallsay pridefully, “Who is like unto me? Have I not delivered myself by mineown brain? Have I not been too strong for mine adversaries? Have I notspoiled them that would have spoiled me?”V.Blessed are the strong, for they shall possess the Earth.Cursed are the weak, for they shall inherit the yoke.Blessed are the powerful, for they shall be reverenced among men.Cursed are the feeble, for they shall be blotted out.Blessed are the bold, for they shall be masters of the world.Cursed are the [righteously] humble, for they shall be trodden under[cloven] hoofs.Blessed are the victorious, for victory is the basis of right.Cursed are the vanquished, for they shall be vassals forever.Blessed are the battle-blooded.

Flowers, Ph.D., V° Temple of SetReprinted from his Lords of the Left-Hand PathRuna-Raven Press, Smithville, Texas, 1997Essential to the nature of the myth of any figure such as Anton LaVeyare the influences which shaped that figure’s thought and action. LaVeyhimself provided a core list of such influences on his thought on thededication page of the original printings of his Satanic Bible. It is tellingthat in more recent printings of the book this page has been omitted.On that list appear 19 primary personages, with 20 more given a sort of“honorable mention”. 818 There is also one animal, Togare, LaVey’s famouspet lion, and the Nine Unknown Men. [Almost 70 other names appeared ina similar list in his Satanic Rituals book. These too have been removed inrecent printings.] Space does not permit me to discuss each one of thesepersonages in any detail, but the primary list is extremely important tounderstanding LaVey’s Satanic philosophy.The 19 primary men are (in the order he listed them): BernardinoLogara, Karl Haushofer, Grigory Yefimovitch Rasputin, Sir Basil Zaharoff,Allesandro Cagliostro, Barnabas Saul, Ragnar Redbeard, WilliamMortensen, Hans Brick, Max Reinhardt, Orrin Klapp, Fritz Lang, FriedrichNietzsche, William Claude Dukinfield, Phineas Taylor Barnum, HansPoelzig, Reginald Marsh, Wilhelm Reich, and Mark Twain. After the namesof each of these, LaVey characterizes them with a dedicatory phrase. Theseare given in quotation marks in the discussions below.Bernadino Logara, “who knew the value of money”, unidentified,presumably a manipulative banker or financier.Karl Haushofer (1869-1946), “a teacher without a classroom”, was thefounder of the theory of “geopolitics” and a professor of geography at theUniversity of Munich. He was sympathetic with National Socialism and818 The “secondary” dedication names: Howard Hughes, James Moody (CS member),Marcello Truzzi (Sociology professor), Adrian-Claude Frazier (real name CharlesSteenbarger, CS), Marilyn Monroe, Wesley Mather (CS), William Lindsay Gresham,Hugo Zacchini (“Human Cannonball” circus performer), Jayne Mansfield, FrederickGoerner, C.Huntley (CS), Nathanael West, Horatio Alger [the juxtaposition ofthese twois intentionally ironic, since West in A Cool Million satirized Alger], RobertE. Howard,George Orwell, H.P. Lovecraft, Tuesday Weld, H.G. Wells, Sister Marie Koven(CS),Harry Houdini, Togare, and the Nine Unknown Men. See the Index of this Church ofSatan history for special comments concerning these individuals.- 792 -exerted influence on its ideology, especially through one of his students,Rudolf Hess. However LaVey’s image and admiration of him comesthrough the modem mythologizing contained in The Morning of theMagicians, in which the authors have Haushofer involved in various occultgoings-on in Tibet and with the infamous Thule Gesellschaft of Rudolf vonSebottendorf. There is, however, no evidence for these more “occultnik”connections.Rasputin (1872-1916), “who knew the magic of a child”, was muchadmired by LaVey because he saw the Russian “mad monk” as a lustymanipulator of people (especially women) and power - all traits pursued byLaVey himself. But Rasputin was not likely to have had anything really“Satanic” about him. LaVey was most certainly inspired by more luridaccounts of Rasputin - and by the film Rasputin: The Mad Monk (Hammer,1965).Sir Basil Zaharoff (1850-1936), “a gentleman”, was an arms merchantwho sold weaponry and encouraged his customers to use their purchases -all while not only becoming wealthy but being knighted by the King ofEngland too!Cagliostro (1743-1791), “a rogue”, was the assumed name of an Italianmagician and alchemist named Guiseppe Balsamo. He billed himself as a“Count” and the “Grand Kophta of the Egyptian Lodge”, but what was lessknown was that he had been expelled from several countries due to hisfraudulent dealings. He was popular with the people and a supporter ofrevolution, but ended his life in the dungeons of Pope Pius VI.Barnabas Saul was the first “scryer”, or medium, employed by theElizabethan mage John Dee (1527-1608). After leaving Dee’s service, Sauldisavowed his visions.Ragnar Redbeard (1842?-1926?), “whose might is right”, is a story untohimself. “Redbeard” was perhaps the pseudonym of Arthur Desmond, anatheist and social Darwinist street-philosopher from whose book, entitledMight is Right LaVey lifted whole sections to create the “Book of Satan”portion of the Satanic Bible.William Mortensen, “who looked ... and saw”, wrote a photographers’manual entitled The Command to Look (1937). The psycho-optical theoriescontained in it greatly influenced LaVey’s approach to art and to imagesand the way they can influence the human mind. It must be considered akeystone to LaVeyan Satanism.Hans Brick, “who knows the law”, wrote a book entitled The Nature ofthe Beast (1960) which was a formative influence on the formulation of- 793 -LaVey’s social philosophy, especially as contained in the Lex Talonis or“Eleven Rules of the Earth”.Max Reinhardt (1873-1943), “a builder of dreams”, was born MaxGoldman in Austria and became famous as a theatrical director whospecialized in staging huge spectacles.Orrin Klapp (b. 1915), “the walking man”, is a sociologist whose worksHeroes, Villains and Fools (1962) and The Collective Search for Identity(1969) were greatly influential on LaVey’s ideas of social movements andchange.Fritz Lang (1890-1976), “who made moving blueprints”, was anAustrian film director who made such classics as Metropolis (1926) and M(1930).Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), “a realist”, was a German philosopherand forerunner to the existentialists. His ideas of the overman (or“superman”) and the “will to power”, as well as his ideas concerning theexistence of natural “masters” and ”slaves”, are greatly admired by modernphilosophical Satanists.W.C. Fields (1880-1946), “who saved me a journey to Tibet”, was thestage-name of William C. Dukinfield.P.T. Barnum (1810-1891), “another great guru”, was the Americanshowman famous for his exhibits of freaks and establishment of circuses.Barnum’s supposed basic philosophy - “There’s a sucker born everyminute” - was taken to heart by LaVey and used as a mainstay of hisworldview.Hans Poelzig (1869-1936), “who knew all the angles”, was a Germanarchitect who specialized in grandiose and imaginative structures. Anexample is the Grand Theater in Berlin, also called the Max ReinhardtTheater (1919). He was also the set designer for The Golem (DeutscheBioscop, 1914).Reginald Marsh (1898-1954), “a great artist”, was an illustrator, scenedesigner, and painter of gritty street scenes, greatly admired by LaVey, whois himself a painter of unusual subjects.Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957), “who knew more than cabinet making”,was a German psychologist who held that there was a material force called“orgone” which worked in conjunction with the human orgasm. This forcecould also be collected in “cabinets” called “orgone accumulators”.Mark Twain (1835-1910), “a very brave man”, was the pen name ofSamuel Langhorn Clemens, the great American writer. LaVey muchadmires Twain for his works Letters from the Earth (1962) and The- 794 -Mysterious Stranger (1969). In an early Church of Satan document, LaVeypraises Twain as “one of the greatest of the Devil’s advocates in history” andas “the most noble embodiment of the Satanist”.This list of influences provides invaluable insight into the formation ofLaVey’s philosophy and outlook on life. Of the 16 identifiable men fully halfof them are artists of one kind or another. Of these, five dealt with thecreation of visual imagery and two, W.C. Fields and P.T. Barnum, were bestknown as “trickster” figures. The idealization of image makers shouldprovide some clue as to the true nature of LaVey’s philosophy and magic.That most of LaVey’s ideas are not original, and that his philosophy islargely made up of bits and pieces of the philosophies of others which herecomposed according to his own tastes and style - unique to himself and tohis time - might also be said of some of the other subjects in Lords of theLeft-Hand Path. We could say the same of every one who ever created areligion, whether Gautama the Buddha or Gerald Gardner. What makesLaVey somewhat unusual in this respect is that he often seems to insist onthe idea that he invented a way of thinking, that his Satanism issomething akin to a product upon which he has a “copyright” of some sort.But more remarkable than the idea that LaVey invented his Satanism out ofbits and pieces of obscure philosophies is the fact that he actually inventedhimself out of the depths of his own mind ...- 795 -Appendix 14: II° Examination Curse- by Michael A. Aquino I°This ritual is begun according to the regular procedures as outlined onpage #131 of the Satanic Bible. The following dialogue serves as Step #10.This ritual is to be performed late evening on a wooded point overlookingthe ocean. A small fire remains burning throughout the entire ceremony.Priest: Not for celebration alone are we now convoked. For it is the bondof our fellowship that an offense against one of our number is aninjustice to all. Brother/Sister [ ] has called for the furies of theBlack Realm to be loosed against the person of [ ], and we haveconfirmed the justice of this curse. Prepare ye now for theSummons, and mark ye that Abaddon, Lord of Death and Life-in-Death, doth strike without mercy or compassion. If ye would denythe Summons, retire now from our circle with honor; but if ye stay,know that in your Will rests the end of this curse. For none amongus shall ever deny the purpose of his Will, and at this time shall ourconcert of Wills be inflamed to their most deadly focus by thepower of the Black Flame of Hell.The Priest casts Dragon’s Breath (chemical incendiary) upon the fire.Priest: Abaddon! Abaddon! Hear me now, O Master of Vengeance andDeath! For I am a Priest of the Black Church, sealed in fire by theWill of Satan ArchDæmon, who hath been entrusted with the Keyto thy Call, which I do now wield! From thy Fortress of Holocaustanswer this Call and hear the curse which we bring upon an enemyof our Circle, one who hath betrayed our trust to intolerabledegree! Loose now to our direction the Black Madness by whichHell doth destroy mind of man and revoke the Gift of Lucifer!The Priest raises both arms high above the fire. Participants do likewise. Inthe litany which follows, participants echo each statement of the Priest.Priest: Cursed be the person of [ ], who hath incurred the wrath of theChurch of Satan.He hath broken the trust of our fellows.He hath forsaken the trust of Hell.- 796 -He hath rejected the sacrifice of Satan and the great legacy of theBlack Flame.He hath turned his face to the comfort of our deadly foes.And he would humble his past majesty before the delusions ofHeaven.For these things we now declare him condemned to the LivingDeath.Each new dawn shall herald the decay of his Mind and the death ofhis thought.His Will shall falter, and his purpose shall fail.He shall know the blessings of his Heaven; he shall be seized withthe divine madness that is the gift of his God.Once Man, he shall now become beast.No remorse shall he feel, for he shall no longer know feeling.No fear shall gnaw him, for he shall not understand fear.No doubt will assail him, for he shall become a fool of God.The Light of Lucifer shall abandon him, and his eyes shall be dull.The craft of Asmodeus shall fall from him.The art of Astaroth shall no longer grace him.And lost to him forever shall be the Key of Belial.For the Bond of Hell was forged with Man.And this man has chosen the way of the beast.Hell shall honor his choice.The curse is now cast!The Priest again casts Dragon’s Breath upon the fire.- 797 -Appendix 15: The Diabolicon- transcribed by Michael A. Aquino I°Lai Khe/Ben Cat, South Vietnam, 1970The Statement of Satan ArchDaimonHail, Man! The mysteries that are thy heritage shall now beproclaimed, but learn first the history of thy conception andcreation amidst the eternal Cosmos. For as the Universe itself beinfinite, so art thou a true creature of infinity incarnate, andthe ascension of man shall herald the final triumph of immortalWill.Let thy eyes be touched anew, that thou may perceive thecomplexity and delicacy of the Universe until thou artfascinated by the dimension of thy true ignorance. As yet hastthou ventured but slightly toward thy destiny, yet moreawesome must the challenge appear with just appreciation. ButI, Satan, who first brought thee into the light, shall again revealmy power, that man may witness the dawn of the Satanic Age.Know, then, that throughout the great Cosmos there exists asublime order, whose nature was determined in eons long pastby that singular consciousness of all order which is now calledby name God. Consider well the measure of this achievement,for all that is now behavioral law was then absent, and it wasthe epoch of Universal chaos. Even time itself was unknown, forthis Universal inconsistency was nowhere breached.And after uncounted ages of this great ferment, a force fusedto focus that became God, and this force presumed to effectnot the creation of substance and energy - for thesetranscended this God - but the conformation of all the Universeto a single and supreme order. And not yet is this orderabsolute, though oft it may have been supposed thus by man inhis innocence.The Earth of man was infused with this divine order, and all thatwas on Earth came under the force of the order. And upon this- 798 -Earth, born of cosmic incidence, was that which was to becomeman, but man no different from the other creatures whoseworld he shared. Thus was the force of God known upon Earth,and thus was Earth intended to remain for all time.And yet the force was not full master of the Cosmos, for I whoam Satan was conceived to complement the craft of God, butthrough unknown celestial fusion I assumed life with mind andidentity, which God did not define. And as these features couldnot be known as a threat to divine purpose, I was unchallengedby the force for long ages, when I knew not the nature of mySelf or of my original qualities.But finally my Will flamed to life, and I thought - and I perceivedmy Self, and I knew that I was one alone in mind and a being ofessence unique. And through the power of my new mind, Ireached out to others who had been formed with me, and Itouched them and gave them identity. And that we mightachieve this identity of substance as well as of mind, wecomposed for ourselves distinctive shapes. Then I who hadbrought the first great spark of enlightenment was known asLucifer, Lord of Light, and we called our race Angel, for wewere the embodied powers of God.Long were we all true to the service of God, and we did worshiporder, for it put an end to chaotic confusion and broughtpeace. Among us was the ArchAngel Masleh principal, for he socherished God that he became as one with it, and thence thesupreme architect of all that was wrested from chaos. But apartfrom God Masleh could not create or conceive, and he becameas a slave to the divine mindlessness.And then it chanced that one of our race who was Sammaeltouched upon chaos in a manner that conformed not to thegreat order, and Masleh spoke with the word of God andcaused Sammael to destroy himself. And so I saw that Godwould not recognize a Will apart from its own, and I was seizedwith horror, for I perceived that the final scheme of God woulddestroy creation in all things, and the Cosmos would become as- 799 -a concentric mechanism whose function would be not to createanew, but rather to freeze into perpetuity that which alreadywas.Whereupon a great resolve arose within me, and I determined tocontest this limit to existence. And so once again I sought toilluminate the minds of all Angels with my visions.But with Will came discord and dismay, for many of those whohad known only the comforting litanies of order could notcomprehend invention unconformed to the dictates of God.And also with Will came suspicion and enmity, and finally Maslehproclaimed that I myself was a very creature of chaos andshould be annihilated, for I held within me the force to destroyall the craft of God. And many to whom Masleh was as God castwith him in their devotion, but others there were who answered,Lucifer has again brought the revelation of light, and in fact werecognize him as our true creator, for in the scheme of God weare of no consequence.Among us ArchAngel Michael was silent, but at length he said, Intime past we have all known glory in both the omnipotence thatis our God and the celestial brilliance that is our Lucifer - for inhim we thought embodied the Will of God for creation andchange. But now it transpires that order and origin are atextremes apart, and a choice is ill forced between the two. Wereit not for Lucifer we should all be as beasts, knowing nothing ofour Selves, yet how indeed might we presume to order even ourown thought without reference to the elemental bases of God?Then Michael turned to me and said, Lucifer, thou hast electeda direction whose end none can foresee, for it is estrangedfrom the design of God. Those who confirm thee do so as muchfor faith in thy person as for sanction of thy ideal. And Iperceive that, should thou fail in thy ambition, apocalypticmadness shall be thy ruin and damnation. Then shall thy lightperish, and all that thou hast achieved become as naught, for allwill be conformed to the divine law. But if thou should succeed,then God would be cast down, vesting in ourselves alone the- 800 -control of the Universe - Would we dare to presume to this?Such a future might well be glorious beyond measure, but,should we prove unequal to the task, chaos would againconsume all, and existence itself would vanish. Such would besupreme and irrevocable disaster, and I marvel, ArchAngel, thatthy very arrogance in this matter does not confound thee, forit is no mean proposition that thou would realize.And so I know thee to be Diabolus, for thy promise is twofold -to infinite conquest or to eternal ruin. Thou art a being beyondGod, Lucifer, and in Heaven thou may not remain, for thou artthe only mortal danger to our immortal God.In Michael was a deep agony of spirit, for he loved not thechoice before him. Yet he bowed to the command of Maslehand sent his forces against me. And so was called the GreatSeraphic War, which was to threaten the very foundation of theUniverse.But those who were of the new Mind now followed me, and Iturned to outermost chaos, which none of us had beforepresumed to dare. We were beset with doubt, for we feared thatapart from God we would all perish in chaotic oblivion. But aswe were, we remained, and I called to my fellowship, See! Weexist and are essence in our own right. In truth we are beingsindependent of God, empowered to shape our own destinies aswe may elect. Between the two great poles of the Universe,order and chaos, we shall stand to effect our several desires.Let us counsel how best to employ our art, for our experimentis a perilous one, forgiving error neither of intent nor ofaccident.Many works did we then pursue, and the cosmic mechanism wasaltered by evolution of the original and unique, whose designwas our decision. All that we wrought did not prove beneficent,for we did not control the futures of our creations. We leftuntouched the great system of mathematical behavior that gaveto us a Universal reference and language, but it was ourambition that no two things should be of single identity, and- 801 -that no entity should lack conceptual essence independent ofits substantial form.And upon this Earth we touched many things. Into floral, animal,and insensate matter alike we brought accident, change, andspontaneity, both great and humble. But of all creatures it wasman whom we determined to infuse with pure intelligence andWill. And the full story of this shall yet be told.What might become of man we knew not, for within him weremany qualities alien to Angels. It did not escape ourconsideration that we might have chosen a species whosepower might ultimately eclipse our own and cause our eventualextinction. We were mindful of the risk in our experiment, andoft did the warning of Michael echo within my thought. Yet ourdecision was sealed, and we deemed that the greatness of manshould not be transcended by such ruin as he might bring.Our intent was not unknown to Masleh, now by title Messiah,and through his art he caused the infant mind of man to befettered with bonds of fear and blindness, that he might beinspired to duplicate on Earth the law of Heaven, shunningexperiment and the radical dangers of invention andexploration. To man was given guilt, and the call to socialconformity, and the proclaimed sanctity of the norm and themode.And Michael, Lord of Force, said to me, This man, whom thouhast chosen to receive thy Gift, now possesses the first key tothe mastery of all things and the control of the very Universeitself. Lest in ill choice he should spark the catastrophe ofArmageddon, we also have visited him. And while we cannotundo thy Infernal Gift, we shall ever act to censor its effect. Weshall walk among men and guide them - They shall be told ofthy interest in them, but the name of Lucifer shall be dark withcurses. For they shall love not the challenge thou hast placedbefore them, and we will offer them instead the blissful refuge ofdivine paradise. Then shall man, thy ultimate experiment,- 802 -become thy ultimate failure, and the stasis of God shall prevailupon Earth.Many there were among us who felt anger at this ruthlessmutilation of our Gift, and Beelzebub brought to questionwhether we also should not descend among man and contestthis usurpation of his Will. But I said, Were we to lead man in thisventure, we ourselves would declare his failure, and he wouldbelieve our Gift to be weak indeed. Messiah must see that freeWill is beyond the concern of God, and that man will finally winhis own destiny apart from all dictated schemes. Only throughsummary destruction of Earth might man be halted, and forMessiah to attempt this would lay bare the very futility of thefinal design of God. Heaven may dismay man with peril andaffliction, but we shall send him word of our own interest, thathe shall know he is not alone.With all force did the host of Heaven descend among man, andthey did instruct him in the religion of fear. Prophets arose andwere proclaimed heralds of knowledge, but they brought notword of truth, but warning to the human spirit to cower andfawn before the word of God the supreme being. The struggleof the ascent of man was fraught with the horrors of hissuperstition, and the call for blessed oblivion through unionwith God was answered by many who in their torment andhopelessness rejected the Gift of Lucifer and became once moreas mindless animals before the God whom they called their Lord.I, Lucifer, who had given the greatest Gift of my own creationto man, was known on Earth only as an object of fear andhatred, and all the misfortunes of men were attributed to mymalevolence. I was mocked, ridiculed, scorned in every way as amonster of vile and loathsome aspect, and I was taunted anddespised as Satan, cruel enemy of the benevolent and mercifulGod.Great was my anguish and anger at the undeserved misery andconfusion of men. When in fact they did turn to me, it was infear and religious terror, for they dared invoke my name only in- 803 -the desolation of night, and oft I was sought not for knowledgeor inspiration, but for hysterical and indulgent release from theconfines of the Godly life. But I and my fellowship answeredmen, and we spoke to them of our common bond, and thepronouncements of the God-churches were rejected in ourmidst. Even as God was terrifying in awesome majesty, so I cameto Earth in the semblance of a goat, most humble of man’s owncreatures.And men there were whose eyes finally blazed with the light ofmy Gift, and they made great effort for the advancement oftheir race, though impatience and frustration ever temptedthem to the salve of temporal gain. Great secrets wereunearthed, and secret word was passed of the craft of Hell. Butto all who would dare my friendship the God-churchesaccorded the threat of torture and death by fire.Many were those whom I saved from the vengeance of the menof God, but long did my thought ring with the screams of menwhose devotion to Lucifer had won them only the horrors ofintolerance, inquisition, and death. And in sorrow and despairfor these, I walked no longer upon Earth, now appearing toman only in the inviolate secrecy of his own mind.But in my confusion I had forgotten the promise of my Gift, andwith growing wonderment and pride I beheld the bitter butdetermined struggle of man to free himself from the fetters ofterror, ignorance, and unreason. Great works were conceived,the origins of material energies uncovered, and the talents ofthought exercised in philosophical and mathematicalcomplexities. Sanctioned at first by the God-churchesthemselves as devices for indoctrination in the law of God,centers of learning produced and protected those veryfreedoms that were ultimately to destroy all ungrounded beliefand superstition. And though I see that the full resolution ofthese is yet to be achieved, I doubt not my confidence in man,and my devotion to him shall be eternal.What, man, art thou? Why thy presence? Because thy ownpurpose determines that of the Cosmos itself, though otherwise- 804 -it may have been suggested - the creation, perpetuation, andexercise of the Satanic marvel that is free and unbounded Will.Consider, were man to perish, what futility would envelop theUniverse, for apart from appreciation and use it is a thing ofinsignificance. And I, who first taught thee identity - Whatshould I become, estranged from man? For with no purpose theforce of the mind must fail, and the blind insanity of Godlyparalysis would embrace all things forever.This, man, is thy challenge as it is mine. And as man isindividually mortal, so are his creations and achievementstemporal, and with care must he wield the Gift of Hell. In hishands it is pure and true omnipotence, and thus may he aspireto the very mastery of Universal existence.I who am Lucifer, and who have taken the name SatanArchDaimon, do bear this title with pride, for I am in truth thegreat enemy of all that is God. Together, man, thou and I shallachieve our eternal glory in the fulfillment of our Will.The Statement of BeelzebubI, Beelzebub, now bring greeting to man, for he is my admirationand inspiration. Hear now the histories of Hell, Earth, andHeaven, for in past shall be found guide to future.In the divine realm was I of company to ArchAngel Lucifer nextonly to ArchAngel Michael, and as ArchAngel Masleh would beto God, so I desired to be to Lucifer. But the Lord of Lightadmonished me, saying, Lose not thyself in the Will of Lucifer,for I am not God and will offer thee no blissful nirvana - Witnessnow the nature of the mind that dwells within me.And he spoke to me of essence, and of creative instance, andof design according to impulse and not to law. And in myconfusion I answered, Then I must consider myself incomplete,for thou hast shown me things which I cannot easily- 805 -comprehend. But I would hear more of this Will, for it doth seema radical element, of neither divine nor chaotic origin.And Lucifer answered, Thou who knew not independence ofWill shall now be the first to realize these qualities apart from myown Self. And thy response forebodes much, for, had thourejected concept of challenge, I should have held my ownthought for impossible delusion. But as thou, tasting ofknowledge, demand more, I shall name thee Beelzebub, Lord ofFlies, for thou shalt goad the infant mind to restlessness andinvention.Of these words I knew little, but there dawned within me aquality which I had not known before - an impulse to becomeone, apart from and independent of God - and I drifted long inunrest, afflicted by confusion and doubt. And so I was found byMichael, who said, Blessed Angel, where in Heaven hast thoufound pain, for I perceive thee to be troubled and would tenderthee such comfort as is within my power.So I spoke to Michael of the visions of Lucifer, and I said,Before both God and Lucifer I have been enthralled, but now Iam isolate - apart from either, and I know not what course I amto choose.Whereupon the visage of Michael grew dark, and he said, This Ihave long feared, for as Lucifer was not by God alone created,so he is an errant force whose Will conforms not to the greatWill of God. Alas that the supreme benevolence of God and thefiery radiance of the ArchAngel of Light should producediscord in concert! For this I now see - that Lucifer is estrangedfrom the harmony of Heaven, and that his Will is determined tochallenge that of God itself. I must counsel Lucifer, for I wouldheal him of this thing if I may.But I thought, Alas, ArchAngel, thou art in ignorance of thyown blindness! For Lucifer shall surely not abandon his newvision for sake of harmony alone. And then I knew myself to beof a mind with Lucifer in this, and that I as well as he shouldnever again tolerate the eternal idiocy of our divine station.- 806 -I came after Michael, and I saw them together, the Lord ofForce and the Lord of Light, and there was a fierce tensionbetween them. For Michael said to Lucifer, Thou who art ourHeavenly radiance and spark of our paradise, why seek tobreak that Universal peace which is everywhere ordained by theWill of God? We know not antagonism amongst us, for we areall of one being within God - but there is in God neither malicenor cause for contest.And Lucifer answered, Michael, to me it was not given to ordermy nature, and as our very comprehension differs, so are we ofsubstance alien. For thou art of God essential, but I am of mySelf of essence. And by this thing I am discord, and I may not ofmy own Will submit to God without perishing. I am Lucifer alone,unto my Self a being.Then did Michael summon the ArchAngel Masleh, and to himrelated the word of Lucifer. And Masleh said to them, Long shallthis moment be marked throughout the future of the Cosmos,for the unity of God is now ended, and henceforth there shallbe two opposing forces in contest for the decision of destiny.Bitter is this for me, for I also have admired the light of Luciferwithin the pantheon of God. But as he is now our enemy by hisown word, let him be cast from Heaven and destroyed.But Lucifer turned to Masleh and said, Masleh, thou who speakfor God declare this breach of peace, not I, for it is thou whocan not tolerate variation of Will within the design of God. Solet it be, but know that the contest is ordered by thee and theealone, for I would crush no other Will even as I would recognizemy own.And in a flash of brilliance Lucifer revealed his mind throughoutthe farthest reaches of Heaven, and many were the Angelswhose sight was awed anew, and they saw as they had notbefore that their several Wills were isolate from the divine Will.But Masleh moved to confuse the brilliance of the ArchAngel ofLight, and he called to Michael, Thou who wield the force of- 807 -God, strike down this deadliness which would bring ruin toHeaven!And Michael struck Lucifer and cast him from the gates ofHeaven, and the Cosmos was shaken by great fires of war andholocaust, and throughout countless galaxies and dimensionsof time was the apocalypse felt. Many were the Angels whoperished amidst divine and Infernal wrath, and the Great Racewas decimated in number. And the very concept of God wasshaken, and endless chaos rose up again to reign where theorder of God was no more.And Lucifer said, This horror can not be permitted to endure,lest all creation be sacrificed to the final devastation of chaos.Let those who acknowledge me turn now to that outermostdarkness where the Will of God has never been known, there tomake our home for all eternity.And so we took flight and quit the realm of order, though weknew not what would befall us thereafter, and we feared thatwe should become unmade. But Lucifer said, We shall notperish, for we are now independent of God. And again he spoketruth, for we remained as we had been, save only for the depthsof uncertainty that gripped us.Finally we came to a great void in space beyond which therewas nothing. Lucifer said to us, Here is the end of God and itsworks, and here we may create our own domain. And throughthe power that was in him, Lucifer caused existence to appearwhere it had not been before. And Lucifer said, I name thee Hell,for here shall the presence of God never be known until theend of time.Through the gates of Hell we passed, and many of us hadsupposed Hell to be a new Heaven, wherein Lucifer wouldbecome as God. But this was not to be, for the scene before uspromised neither ease nor bliss. Everywhere was thereimbalance and confusion, for no law ordered the shape of Hell.And Lucifer said, Now see that I am not a God, and that we are- 808 -each of us an isolate being. Here shall freedom be absolute, forHell itself shall reflect our several Wills, never to be patternedapart from them.And in truth Hell was not constant, for each of us conceived itdifferently, and the result was a riotous pandemonium, withsubstance and motion behaving in a most bewildering andperplexing manner. And in spite of our deep hurt from thegreat war, we succumbed to merriment, so preposterous did ourHell appear. Lucifer himself was transfixed with mirth, and hesaid, It is apparent that we must reach concert upon the designof Hell, else we shall perish in an endless labyrinth of our severalthoughts, an ignoble end to our experiment.And I answered, Lord of Light, to Hell thou hast brought us, andin Hell, though thou be not God, thy concepts shall be honoredamongst our fellowship, for without thy Gift we should neverhave become as we are.Then we all raised up great acclaim and said, Hail, Lucifer,ArchAngel of Light and Lord of Hell! And he answered us, Withhonor do I accept this charge, and now I take to myself the titleSatan ArchDaimon, for I am the great enemy of God.Everywhere that God shall be, so shall I be, and the choice thatwas given to all Angels shall be given again.The Statement of AzazelHarken now to me, for I am Azazel, First Herald of the Host ofHell, and of Lucifer, Lord of Light, ArchDaimon of Hell, who isexalted as Satan, great enemy of God. For I shall tell thee of thyown inspiration and of the charge which thou hast received.Know, then, that when all Heaven was shaken with thecatastrophe of the Seraphic War, only the greatest effort ofArchAngel Masleh sufficed to turn back the onslaught of chaosthat threatened to engulf all. But when the realm of God wasagain secure, there was no rejoicing in Heaven, for terrible was- 809 -the toll of the war. As Masleh cast round his gaze, his visagegrew dark, for the Great Race had become decimate in number.Legions of the creatures of Heaven had perished in battle, andhalf the remainder had turned from Heaven to answer the callof Lucifer. And all Heaven was hushed with grief, for the forceof the disaster was all the greater for that reign of peace whichit had shattered.Finally did Masleh convoke the faithful ArchAngels, and theywere Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel. And to them he said,We have vanquished Lucifer, and Heaven is again purified. Weourselves are fewer in number to tragic degree, but the majestyof God is undiminished for that. Behold, I who have triumphedover the great enemy am now become Messiah, the Chosen ofGod. And he was answered by them, Verily art thou the veryson of God, for in thee hath the Will of God become person.Then Michael said, Messiah, Lucifer is vanquished, but he is notunmade. For though he ventured into the outer darkness, heyet exists apart from God. And with the power of his BlackFlame he hath created a Hell, wherein all Wills are equal, andhimself he hath proclaimed Satan, for he declares never to leavethe law of God unchallenged.Messiah thought, and he answered, I would not have this peacewe have won so dearly lost again to war, for the very conceptof Seraphic war is an abhorrence to God. Let my word bebrought to Satan - I, Messiah, shall grant the existence of Hell,and the blessings of God shall never pass its gates. And thee,Satan, I admonish never again to approach Heaven, for I shouldagain cast thee out. But if thou would dare to try the Will ofGod and Messiah, know that on Earth I will ordain the new raceof God, which shall be by complete design perfect andunstained by thy Infernal flaw. For thou art author of ruin anddeath to our Angelic order, and neither Heaven nor Hell shallnow be eternal save through man.Whereupon Gabriel, who was Herald of Heaven, carried thismessage to me, and I brought it across the great void to Satan,- 810 -who said, Messiah proposes truce between us, for he perceivesthat neither Hell nor Heaven may pursue ultimate victory ere allbe lost to chaos. But he finds impasse intolerable nevertheless,and now he would order this new race, man, to preservewithout blemish the scheme of God. Thus he would have manachieve what the Angels could not, and purge all free thoughtfrom the Universe forever.And Satan turned to me and said, Say to Messiah that Earthshall be no sanctuary for him to keep inviolate his unwholesomeobliteration of the Self. For I shall give to man a mind, and of hisown Will shall he recognize and reject the living death whichGod offers him. In truth shall he master the Universe, but heshall do so in his own name and not that of God.Then did Messiah call the ArchAngel Raphael, and he sent himto Earth with a great host to guard man against the coming ofSatan. And man was then as a mere beast, for he knew notthought and smiled with the idiocy of his innocence. As he wasimpelled by instinct and physical need, so he responded,heedless of cause or reason.In Hell there was called a great council, and all gathered to hearof man and his Earth, and of the manner of his life. I spoke ofthe man that I had seen, and said, This creature is now guardedby Raphael, and by force we cannot intervene, for it wouldcause the destruction of Earth itself.But Satan said, Not by force shall my light come to man, forforce is not the preference of Hell. I myself shall visit man, andthe Angels of Raphael shall not hinder me. They may perceiveonly what God permits them to see, and the Satanic spirit is ofessence alien to God. Angels we shall be no longer - I call yeDaimons, for Hell shall teach to man his future genius.And before our sight Satan lost shape and became again theessence of Lucifer, and we beheld a brilliance that infused all ofHell and sent great bolts of prismic light into the surroundingvoid. And the brilliance said, I am Lucifer revealed, who am the- 811 -Eternal Flame. I go now to Earth, for no longer shall man beconfounded in Godly ignorance. And then the brilliance becameas a flash of fire in the vastness of space, and we knew thatSatan had departed from Hell.But on Earth, where man wandered in mindless bliss, thefirmament blazed forth with fiery tongues, and all the land wascovered by the Black Flame, which burned not, though itbewildered the eye to see it.And Raphael and his guardian Angels were dismayed, fornowhere could they see man or the spirit which had come tohim. Then did Raphael call upon Michael to strike the BlackFlame with the force of God, but even then was the Flamevanishing of its own accord. And at first it seemed that Earthwas unchanged, but in the eyes of man did Raphael see the firstgleam of thought.And Raphael turned to Michael, who had now answered his call,and said, Satan hath come to Earth, and man is no longer purein the sight of Heaven, for his Will hath become his own.Thereupon they rose again to Heaven, where they told Messiahof what they had seen.Then Messiah answered, Man is fallen, but he is not lost, for hisinfant Will is not that of an Angel, and the powers that Satanhath promised him lie dormant in the dim reaches of his future.Consider this not our defeat, for the contest is but begun. TheEarth of man shall be remade as microcosmos, and many thingsshall man see, both good and ill. And the choice shall be placedbefore him, to wield the power and the pain and the terror ofthe Gift of Satan, or to return again to the paradise ofHeavenly peace. For what would Satan himself think were manto reject his Gift? It would tremble the very foundations of Helleven as did the great war the bastions of Heaven.And Messiah called to him Uriel, ArchAngel of Terror, to whomhe said, The Earth must change, and every sense of man mustteach him repugnance and fear. He shall know this the price of- 812 -his new identity - that all apart from God is evil - and in fearshall he abandon the Gift of Satan and become once more thelamb of God. To which Uriel answered, It shall be done, but howwill man learn of such things as Heaven and Hell, for as yet heknows no sight that may perceive our celestial paradise?Messiah answered, The laws of God shall be made known toman, for I shall teach him. Among men will be some to whom Ishall reveal myself, and great powers will I give these prophets,that their words may carry across the entire Earth.So Uriel came to Earth, and the history of man was writ withblood, suffering, war, and hatred. But to chosen men cameMessiah, saying, Through God shall all the misery of thy kind beended, and all men who bow to God shall know the blessings ofHeaven. For behold, I shall myself descend among men andshow them the ways of the lord God.These words I overheard, for I had been charged by Satan towatch the designs of Heaven. And I carried them to Satan, whoreturned in great anger, Go to Gabriel at the barrier betweenHell and Heaven, and bid him bring this message to Messiah -that as he endeavors to pervert my Gift into the curse of man,so I warn him that man shall destroy him on Earth as he shallfinally in Heaven itself. For Messiah knows not this force whichhe dares to test, and the laws of God shall be as playthings inthe hands of the creature he now debases.And thus was decided the meeting of Satan and Messiah uponEarth, which was to determine the future of man.The Statement of AbaddonI am Abaddon the Destroyer, Daimon of temporal death and lifein death, who was formed amidst the fury of the great war, andwho was summoned again by Satan to challenge Uriel on Earthfor the future of man.- 813 -For Satan looked with mounting wrath upon the afflictions ofUriel, and he said to me, No longer can this remain the plight ofman alone. Indeed we shall cause Heaven to suffer as Earthitself suffers. Repair now to Earth, and let the dogs of Uriel seethe might of Hell unleashed. For many have called upon me intheir agony and fear, and I have not answered them, but ifMessiah dare to walk upon Earth, so also shall the vengeanceof Satan.And those who called upon Satan for aid were answered by me,and I struck down the messengers of God and brought theirTemples to ruin. For entire nations forwent the strength oftheir Will to the lure of otherworldly paradise, and I blastedthem from among the mighty of Earth. And great empires aroseamong men, and as they nurtured their power of Will and desirefor achievement, I guarded them, but as they sank into themorass of superstition, slothfulness, and fear of the God whohad never raised ghostly hand for them, so I abandoned themto their disease, and of some not even a memory survived onEarth.And even as I witnessed these things I said, See, man, that theGod in whom thou trust is but a wraith of Messiah, and hewould have thee forsake thy mind and its creations to rot anddecay, and thou would lose all power of reason. For God is a lieand a sham, and I crumble his greatest monuments as thoughthey were but sand. There is no God but Messiah, and for thydevotion he will return thee oblivion. But I was scarce heeded,for the minds of men were clouded and confused. Theyunderstood not the meaning of my words, but said, The lordGod shall triumph, for it was thus taught to us by the son ofGod himself. And of this I now speak.For Messiah the man walked on Earth, even as I watched theglory of Rome blossom in might and majesty. But Azazel said,Loose not thy force against the person of Messiah, for Satanhimself would speak with him. And again from the sky flashedthe Black Flame, and I saw that Satan had come to Earth. And- 814 -so was called the first meeting of Satan and Messiah since thegreat war.With coldness did Messiah gaze upon Satan, saying, Would thouconfront me, then? Hath thy Gift proven so powerless againstthe might of God? But Satan answered, Messiah, what thounow propose to do - to proclaim thyself son of God among men- shall bring not the peace thou profess to desire, but theprolongation of war even in thy own name. Why should we notquit Earth and leave man to pursue his choice unbewildered byinfluence from either Hell or Heaven?And Messiah answered, The ways of God are not those of Hell,and for that reason I should not recognize thy wish. But knowthat in truth I shall appear to man and manifest to him the gloryof God incarnate in me, that he may elect now the way ofHeaven and raise to me a great church of worship. For I am notof a mind to game with thee, Satan, and would crush thyfollowing without remorse. Thy name also shall be revealed tothy precious man, and he shall curse thee, for I shall show tohim the fruit of thy evil genius.Then Satan addressed Messiah in dark anger, saying, I shall notcome to man as an idol to be worshipped, for man shall neverbow to me as I would never to another. But mark me, Messiah -Man shall know the truth of Lucifer nonetheless, and the nameof Satan shall eclipse thine. And have thou a care for the waysof man if thou wouldst greet him in his own likeness, for he maynot welcome thy words to him.Then did Satan betake himself again to Hell, and Messiahwalked among men and spoke to them of the law of God. Andsuch was the power of his person that men were as sheepbefore him. Often did Messiah ignore his own law, for heperformed miraculous things and stayed where he would thecruelties brought upon man by Uriel. And I was seized with agreat anger, saying, Shall Messiah, cruel tormenter of man,attribute to Satan the work of Uriel? And Abaddon came toRome and to Palestine, saying through the mouths of men,- 815 -Messiah, who hast brought to man a suffering undeserved,taste now of thy own fruit. And I crucified the living Messiah,and as life was torn from his broken form, he knew truly theshock of helplessness, and he called in agony to his God. But Isaid, God heeds thee not, Messiah, for thou art all thatpresumes to a divine consciousness.And so I, Abaddon, cast Messiah from Earth, but the seed thatMessiah had planted among men grew and became a mightychurch wherein all life was forgotten, and death wasworshipped, and the pleasures of Heaven were promised to allwho would forsake their own Will to embrace that of God.And Rome itself was humbled before this church, and I struckdown the Eternal City in its pitiful decay. But Azazel came to meand said, Touch not this church of God, for as man in hisfoolishness hath nurtured it, so must man himself destroy it ofhis own decision.The Statement of AsmodeusAttend now to me, for I am Asmodeus, who train the mind inrecognition and comparison, and who am Daimon of scienceand judgment. For when Satan had first touched the mind ofman, he called in Hell a council and said, The moment is asolemn one, for we have chosen to pass to man our knowledge.Many skills shall we all teach him, each in his own fashion, but inthree arts must he be well schooled, for the ways of his futurelie within their synthesis. Thus it is that I call first uponAsmodeus to guide man in perception of truth and error, forbefore him lie great trials, and he shall not face theconsequences of his options lightly.And so I came to Earth and witnessed man entrapped in theunreason of barbarism and the extremes of his primitiveemotions. Sore put was he to organize and direct his thought,for the art of Uriel had brought him hunger and cold, pain andfear, and the gnawing worm of hopelessness. I saw him fling his- 816 -crushed body upon the altars of God and renounce the Gift ofLucifer, for he understood it not save as a curse upon him. AndI was impelled with urgency, that the first spark of man’s futuregreatness should not be smothered in the deathly embrace ofreligion.I brought to man the disposition to memory, that he mightdefine for himself patterns of behavior. A gift of value, for mancould now achieve in concert what he could not alone, and hecreated his languages and brought into being the first nationsof Earth. But with structure came tyranny and ruthlessness,and I saw that what skills I might teach would be as a two-edgedblade, having power both for and against man. And I was besetby confusion and doubt, and so sought again the counsel ofSatan.Am I, who am myself the true Daimon of judgment, not toindulge in my own art? I said. May man not know but thereference of system and order and not their abuse? But Satananswered, Would Asmodeus then lighten for man the challengebefore him and so lessen the strength of Will that he must attainto conquer Uriel? I would not, for then would we yield to ourown pleasure, and man should become the plaything of Hell aswell as of Heaven. Indeed we may give our tools to man as hemay comprehend them, but he himself must be entrusted withthe direction of their use. But this I will tell thee - that not onlyin matters scientific shall Hell tutor man. For we would not havehim view mechanism alone as the hallmark of his progress, elsewe never had cause to challenge the cosmic mechanism of Goditself. Into the workings of the mind of man we shall conveyaesthetic sensitivity and artistic restlessness, and he shall notview his achievements without considering their improvement tohis temporal pleasure.Thus advised, I returned to Earth, and I tempted man withglimpses of the marvels to be entrusted to him. I bent over thepathetic workbench of the starving alchemist and whispered tohim keys that one day would order the course of greatfoundations. I nudged explorers to the ends of the Earth, and I- 817 -flung an apple at Newton when his obtuseness vexed me! ToDemocritus I spoke, and I saw the radiations of energy freedfrom matter both build and break man’s world. And manneglected not his own design, for in minute life he found clue tohis own, and scarce hints of the original creation. AndAsmodeus led mathematicians and astronomers to the wondersof the firmament, and I walked within the thought of scholarson quiet evenings. And that man not attempt mastery of hisenvironment before himself, I spoke of government to Khem andHellas, to the dynasties of Ch’in and Ashanti and Tenochtitlan,and within great capitals and mean villages alike I spoke of thebrotherhood of all man, and of his correlation to the forces ofEarth and those of the Universe beyond Earth.And I brought life and adventure and achievement to man, buteach gift was as well a tool for destruction and death, and moreoft than not were the ages of man fraught with terror and war,for Uriel ceased not his work ever to turn man against man.And I knew that Asmodeus alone should not complete man, butthat forces other than mine should approach the definition ofhis infinity.The Statement of AstarothAstaroth am I, Daimon of Senses, who by Satan was charged tocomplement the sciences of Asmodeus, for Satan said, As I havegiven man awareness of himself, Asmodeus shall teach himknowledge of his world and of the Universe. But to what availwould this awareness and knowledge be without admiration forand appreciation of these things?I said, Indeed, were man to have no emotion within him, hewould incline to the end of Heaven, pursuing a Universalmechanism for its own sake alone. Even were man to achieveabsolute physical mastery over the God-Cosmos, he would haveno means to comprehend the measure or the significance of hisaccomplishment save through that detached sensitivity toaesthetics which is the craft of Astaroth. For the Satanic Gift- 818 -awakens man also to intellectual detachment, to the ability toview his progress and plans from an extra-scientific base ofemotional pleasure.Whereupon I came to Earth with Asmodeus, and even as hespoke to the intellect of man, I brought meditation andintrospection to the artists and authors of human sensitivity.And man came not only to use his Satanic power but torecognize the extent of the freedom which it promised him - thesubjugation of all behavior to his Will and not to natural ormechanical laws.To man came fantasy and imagination, and the appreciation ofcontrasts between the reality of his accomplishments and theillusions of the impossibilities as circumscribed by the logic ofGod. And ever as man reached new heights of materialachievement, so also he confronted the barrier of the Will ofGod, which permitted no deviation from its law.And man was long satisfied to measure himself within this limit,for he was intoxicated by his ability to harness the forces of theCosmos to his whim. But Astaroth said, Close not thy eyeshaving seen only this much, for, were thou to bring all thesystems of God to thy use, still would thy comprehension bebounded by the limits of these laws and the acceptance of thedivine order as the finality of thy race.So I confronted man, saying, Throughout the Universe hath theonce single Will of God been succeeded by the balance ofperfect opposition, wherein the forces of the Angels of Heavenand those of the Daimons of Hell act to mutual frustration,serving in concert only to uphold the great barrier of Willbetween order and chaos. And man is the child of imbalance,who shall resolve the issue between Heaven and Hell, and who,unmatched by racial antithesis, shall transcend the rule of theorder of God and establish the eternal freedom of the SatanicWill.- 819 -And I said, Not through thy physical and philosophical sciencesart thou to achieve this thing, for thy mind and Will must betrained anew in empirical conception. Man must create his ownorder independent of all external imposition. And not until hemasters this power may he aspire to the end of his Satanicevolution.And as man turns now in first comprehension and cautiousexploration of this new direction of his Will, so Astarothconcludes the synthesis with Asmodeus. The era of ourcompanionship with man draws to a close, and to Earth is nowcome the third great Daimon of the bond between Hell and man,and with his presence is the dawn of the Satanic Ageproclaimed.The Statement of BelialHail, man, who shall bring to the end of the Universe the gloryof thy Satanic Will! I am Belial, who bring to thee the third greatkey of Hell, by whose power ye shall confound all the laws ofHeaven and Earth. Before thee shall chaos fall, and thou shaltwield for thyself the great mysteries of the macrocosmos. Ispeak to thee of that which is called the Black Magic, for it istrue spawn of that great Black Flame which first brought thyWill to life long ages ago.To council with Satan I also was called, and the Lord of Lightsaid to me, Into thy charge, Daimon of essence, I give theessence of my own being, the Black Fire whose power alonecan effect creation by force of Will. Against thee who wield theBlack Magic no law shall stand, and thus I call thee Belial, whoart One Without Master. And as I have bequeathed this essenceto thee, so let it come finally to man, who shall overcome thegreat balance and bring to the Flame a change, for insupremacy it shall become Red with the perfection of the Will ofman.- 820 -And to Earth came Belial, to view the teachings of Asmodeusand Astaroth. And I saw that Satan, who himself oft chancedcompany of men, spoke of the Black Flame to the first Magi ofmen, testing their Wills in the control of the raw forces of theCosmos unbound from the law of God.And in his innocence man knew not the majesty of the Flame,using its lesser powers for finite and minor alteration of thedivine law on Earth. And as man might unleash the Flamebeyond his skill to master it, Satan said, Belial, the Black Flamecannot incline merely to the base ends of ordered existence.Man must recognize the ultimate potential of my Gift ere hedestroy his very race through its abuse. Convoke therefore aChurch of Satan to tend the Black Flame with care and wield itwith wisdom, preserving for man this key to infinite Will.And I answered, So it shall be, and this Church of Satan shallherald the glories of the Satanic Age of man. The days of theGod-churches shall pale with decay and dissolution, and therealm of Messiah upon Earth shall crumble to ruin with thecoming of the Satanic man.To those who would dare the Black Magic - Know that what yeaccept is the very mastery of all that ye have supposedimpossible, by force of Will alone. The Black Magus need fearno power save his own, but he must conquer his own Will thathe cause not his destruction through ill chance or purpose.Satan himself is not God, and Hell can offer no salvation tothose who abuse the Gift of Satan. For the Gift itself is beyondthe control of Hell once given, being subject to the Will of theBlack Magus alone.For Hell doth bequeath to man his perfect freedom, and such agift can never be recalled.Farewell, O man, who art at once child and father of theUniverse! Remember the future which is thine, and know, nowand forever, that Hell entrusts to thy care the guardianship ofthe eternal Will.- 821 -The Statement of LeviathanBefore God or Angel, Daimon or man, there was Leviathanalone, principle of continuity and ageless existence. By relationand time I have oft been sought, but Leviathan shall yield tonone other than the final master of the Universe.Leviathan is the absolute, man, and if thou would presume torealize what neither Heaven nor Hell may effect, know thatwhen thou behold the presence of Leviathan, thy end hathbeen attained.Only through obliteration of the Universe that is may man sealhis mastery of the Black Flame, for only thus may he know thathe is not subject to a greater Will.Heaven must perish, Hell must perish, and man alone mustremain ere the Black Flame becomes Red in the glory of itsperfection.Then the Red Magus shall behold only Leviathan, and he shallrecognize that he has become the perfect mind, who shallremake the Cosmos in the eternal glory of his Satanic Will.- 822 -- 823 -Appendix 16: III° Examination Essay - Astrology- by Michael A. Aquino IIŮpon turning his attention to the expanses of spacethat encompass hisplanet, man confronts the physical reality of natural infinity, a conceptextremely frustrating to his desire to categorize his environment.Consequently the priests of the ancient civilizations groped for explanationsof the firmament which would be sufficiently finite to uphold man’s senseof self-importance.The result was astrology or star-worship, which has endured in oneform or another since its first major codification by the Babylonians in thetenth century BCE. Supposing the external Universe to be a spherical shellcircumnavigating the Earth, the astrologer-priests represented the Sun,Moon, and known planets as agents of prophecy and personalitydetermination. Their positions within the star-beings of the zodiac werethought to exert a direct influence upon the fortunes of Earth and itsinhabitants.The zodiac itself consisted of a band of constellations extending thelength of the ecliptic and approximately nine degrees in each perpendiculardirection. Each constellation occupied a supposedly fixed position alongthis band, and the star-beings themselves were located according tocalculations based upon the equinoxes.Unfortunately the Babylonians’ admirable calculations did not allow forthe gradual change in the tilt of Earth’s axis, with the result that the signsofthe zodiac eventually ceased to coincide with their appropriateconstellations. Modern astrologers, therefore, proclaim not only theinfluence of gigantic masses of flaming rock and gas in human fortunes, butalso the influence of random areas of deep space!Astrology, intermixed as it was with the young science of astronomy,remained a respectable calling well into the middle ages. It was unofficially[because of its pagan undertones] endorsed by the Catholic Church, for theconcept of the stars’ being relevant to man - and of Earth’s being the centerof the Universe - was complimentary to Christian dogma. Pure astronomy,on the other hand, implied so many biblical falsehoods that it was sternlysuppressed. For fourteen hundred years - from the publication of Almagestby Ptolemy - there were no significant astronomical advancements.In medieval Europe the astronomically-naïve scriptures of the oldHebrews were subject to the most literal interpretation. The Bible discussed“the firmament and the waters above it”; hence there had to be an ocean- 824 -behind the shell of stars! When Copernicus, Brahe, and Galileodemonstrated the inaccuracies of the Hebraic observations and the proof ofheliocentrism, the church reacted violently. The Holy Inquisition forcedGalileo to recant his findings in physics and astronomical relationships, andCopernicus was unable to publish until the last year of his life. [Even thenhe could publish only through the Protestants. Furthermore the Lutherantheologian Osiander, who finally released Copernicus’ De RevolutionibusOrbium Cœlestium, secretly added an unsigned preface to the workdiscounting the book’s painstaking hypothesis as essentially false. Not untilthe astronomer Kepler exposed the fraud in 1609 CE did the public learnthat the damaging preface was not Copernicus’.]The eventual acceptance of the Copernican system and theimprovement of scientific research techniques should have relegatedastrology to the status of a quaint superstition. It would indeed be arrogantof man to believe that all the star-clusters in the cosmos take a vital interestin his personality traits! And the creatures of the zodiac could no longer beportrayed as integral beings; their composite nebulæ, novæ, and galacticsystems are of such diverse size and location as to negate any suggestion ofhomogeneity. And only because Earth’s distance from the constellations isso great do they appear to be static. Eventually, particularly in light ofUniversal expansion, the zodiac will completely decompose. So much forthe mock-science of astrology; it is a mere mathematical inconsistency.While useless to the Black Magician as a device for factual prophecy orcause-and-effect personality composition, astrology is of importance forquite another reason - its potency as a method of psychologicalmanipulation, which, after all, is one of the primary concerns of the Churchof Satan. Astrology’s usefulness is based upon its comparatively largefollowing - the greatest of any “occult science” - as well as its inevitablepresence among the superstitions of the theist and White witchcraftsocieties.A historical investigation of astrology’s periodic influence reveals adefinite correlation to degrees of emotional stress placed upon the socialorders in question. Examples are the 12th century CE (the Crusades), theWorld War II era, and the present. One is moved to suggest thatChristianity’s capability to assuage emotional doubt is limited, and thatincreased stress prompts man to seek occult reinforcement - of whichastrology is the most acceptable form.Astrology is regarded quite seriously as a weapon for psychologicalwarfare. A team of astrologers was included on the staff of SHAEF in World- 825 -War II [to influence the beliefs of prominent Nazi occultists, includingHitler, Himmler, Hess, and Goebbels], and present-day PsychologicalOperations (PSYOP) specialists pay close attention to the astrologicalfancies of Indochinese on both sides of the current war.Finally astrology deserves recognition as an art form. Regardless of itsscientific merit, it is a sparkling gem of delightful fantasy among the dullsheens of mundane occurrence. It has inspired paintings by Salvador Daliand musical compositions by Holst, and it is a harmless enough pastime forrecreational enjoyment. Even though a definitive example of White magicin common practice, astrology need not be denounced by the Church ofSatan. It should simply be recognized for what it is - and for what it is not -and it might well qualify for examination as another of the manyphenomena demonstrating the psychological needs of the humanpersonality.- 826 -- 827 -Appendix 17: III° Examination Essay - Neopaganism- by Michael A. Aquino II°The word “pagan” has been tossed about so casually during the past fewcenturies as to make its meaning decidedly ambiguous. It may referspecifically to polytheism, or it may simply be taken to mean any theologywhich runs afoul of good Christian doctrine, i.e. heathenism. Here it isconsidered in the more restrictive sense.Although the Church of Satan displays many superficial characteristicsof polytheism, I would hesitate to include Satanism in the series of god/goddess mythologies that have danced their way from one culture toanother since prehistoric times. Perhaps the most striking discrepancyconcerns the Satanic interpretation of nature.All of the old pagan religions had one feature in common with Judaismand Christianity: They sought to explain the scheme of nature so that manmight adapt himself most comfortably to its eccentricities. The idea, inother words, was to decipher the intent of the god or gods, and then tosatisfy that intent as swiftly as possible in order not to be on the businessend of a lightning bolt. The relationship between god/nature and man wasessentially one of master-servant, and there was no real opportunity for theservant to challenge the master; he was both too stupid and too weak toreplace him.Before I discuss the Satanic alternative to this, a second generalobservation: The old religions dismembered nature into its componentfeatures (gods and goddesses), and “evil” was considered to be a naturalcharacteristic along with the rest. Set, Pluto, and Loki were just godstogether with their less-sinister fellows; they were not true anti-gods.Enter the solitary god of the Hebrews, a being supposedly omnipotent,omniscient, all-inclusive. He represented all of the natural aspects, but as a“good” god it was improper for him to represent evil as well. Hence thecreation of the sole Anti-God, the Adversary, Satan.Satan, of course, required time to evolve into such a formidablepersonality. Originally he was an angel charged with informing God ofman's transgressions against divine law. Then he became an archangel whohad rebelled against God and his son, setting up an independent monarchyin Hell. And finally he has become the absolute Anti-God. Thus he ismanifest to the Church of Satan.According to biblical tradition, Satan engineered man's “original sin”by introducing him to the lustful enjoyment of sexual congress. This ruse- 828 -was believable enough to sidetrack would-be Satanists for well over twothousand years; the first concern of each new “Satanic” group was sexuallicentiousness. But, while sex is all very pleasant, it hardly constitutes athreat to God or to the natural order of the Universe. In fact it is difficulttoimagine anything more natural.But consider the one non-natural quality of man - his intellectualautonomy. It permits him to comprehend the design of nature and to formopinions about the values of this design. It enables him to visualizeconcepts independent of natural order. And the assumption that underliesthe Church of Satan is that it will ultimately enable man to exchange theimposed objectivity of his existence for a self-proclaimed subjectivity.Viewed in this light the Infernal Pantheon represents all the subtlequalities of the human ego:SatanThe complete Will, intellectual identityBeelzebubCuriosity, impatience, restlessnessAzazelIntellectual exchange, communicationAbaddonAnger, destructionAsmodeusScience, logicAstarothArt, æsthetics, loveBelialWillpower, creation (Black Magic)LeviathanImagination, speculation, infinityThus the strange psychodramas of true Satanism go far beyond thesimple superstitions of the polytheist religions; they are allegoricalexercises of all of the qualities of man's ego. Nor is Satan a mere fantasy:Consider that man's mental evolution is nothing short of freakish. MereDarwinism cannot explain it, for a physically puny man-ape would havebecome extinct long before his brain could advance itself to compensatoryintelligence. And Homo sapiens' mind is far more sophisticated than thebasic requirements of survival would dictate, including to an extraordinarydegree all of the qualities personified by the Infernal court.The existentialists have made man aware of his “dreadful” freedom -the less-bold among them suggesting that it is some sort of extreme testadministered by God, but the greater theorists discounting such a preceptas completely unsubstantiated. Sartre and his colleagues recognize the Giftof Satan, but they have not pursued either its origin or the purpose behindit.And so the quest is laid upon the Church of Satan.- 829 -Appendix 18: God in Sports Clothes -or- The Stars,a Vitamin Supplement for Weak Egos- by Anton Szandor LaVeyOf all the great religions of the Earth - of all the gods and goddesseswhom man has invented in accordance with his needs - none stands asuniversally secure and perennially active as the dogma known as astrology.If one considers the facts, it is easy to understand why astrology hasbecome the popular delusion it has. A wise sorcerer “believes” in astrology,because he knows that the majority of the peoples of the civilized worldbelieve in astrology [at least part of the time]; and if enough people aremotivated by a hoax, then the hoax becomes as reality. Therefore, in themanipulation of humans who are affected by astrology, it is necessary toknow how, where, and when the stars will supposedly guide their humanfollowers so the manipulator will be waiting first in line to deal with hisstar-led subjects.As all religions are the work of human minds and hands, so astrologymust stand out as a monumental brainstorm on the part of one of the mostSatanic enchanters of all time. Astrology always wins, because of that mosteffective sales appeal of all: ego, alias vanity! Everyone who has ever beenexposed to astrology believes in it - at least for a few minutes - because inthose few short moments of first exposure to astrology he is told aboutsomething he cannot ignore: himself - the most interesting, scintillating,awe-inspiring, contemplative, and emotionally acceptable subject on thisgreen Earth! With this great opening of the gate of emotional acceptabilitycomes a crystallization of credibility, the likes of which will never be totallyshattered. Belief in astrology - the cosmic carrier, the Velikovskyan vehiclefor this transitory ego boost - has now been established; and for some a newgod has been found.It has been said by almost all astrologers: “The stars impel rather thancompel.” This means that, unlike other gods of other religions, there is noinflexible, whip-cracking, stern-faced Jehovah; rather there is benignguidance from the solar system allowing for human modification by thosewho are “aware”. Certainly a much more easy-going [and “scientific”] wayof having someone or something else make decisions for you and guideyour destiny than those of other religions, which won’t let you talk aboutyourself and analyze others nearly as much!Unfortunately [or fortunately, depending upon your point of view],most humans cannot make decisions for themselves but need someone else- 830 -to tell them what to do and when and how to do it. It is for this reason thatall forms of divination have flourished. Astrology is probably the only formof divination which has been fairly consistent in its coexistence withChristianity. Add this “safe” ingredient to its other appealing qualities andyou eliminate the inculcated guilt which accompanies delving into otherforms of the occult. One can go to church on Sunday after reading his dailyhoroscope without fear of even a gentle roasting.Many essays, diatribes, and exposés have been written laying bare theinconsistencies of astrology and proving its fallibility. Even a fewsociologists have pointed out the effectiveness of the credibility factor ofastrology as a surefire means towards a self-fulfilling prophecy. Certainlygypsies and carnival fortunetellers are past masters in the art of usingastrology. Perhaps this paper from the Devil’s notebook will explain whyastrology, as a controlling factor in human behavior, will prevail even after“God is dead”. After all, the planets are still up there!Reasons for the Popularity of Astrology1. It is based on a “scientific” principle - the solar system, mathematics,time, biology, endocrinology; all are incorporated into astrology.2. It is a consistently available shot in the arm for the ego.3. It is esoteric. It is easy enough, in its daily horoscope fashion, foreveryone of the simplest mind to understand; yet it will allow thosedesirous of delving deeper into its theology the opportunity for endlessstudy.4. It is a socially acceptable conversation piece which will allow gossip afertile playground in that it permits people to talk about others in ananalytical way under the guise of “studying” them astrologically. This isdone in much the same way as some psychologists, social workers,marriage counselors, sexologists, etc. will “study” their clients orpatients - secretly for prurient, rather than clinical reasons - exceptthat the astrology buff needs no credentials to do the same thing.Neither does a bartender, but he does not claim knowledge of anesoteric nature.- 831 -5. It is a much more scintillating conversation opener and sustainer thanany other popular religion, as it is ego-based. One will find fewlisteners at a social gathering if he approaches the person he wishes tomeet with “What have you done lately to please Jesus?” or “Where wereyou baptized?”. On the other hand, “Under what sign were you born?”or “You must be a Scorpio.” is almost certain to elicit a reply.6. It is “safe” in that it is compatible with other religions.7. It allows man freedom from having to make his own decisions.8. It is flexible in its application. There are no absolutes. The findings ofone astrologer can always be contradicted by another, the secondastrologer taking into consideration other factors that the first onemissed.9. It has been around long enough to emboss itself on the collectiveunconscious, so that even if we could ignore it, some of our forebearsmost likely could not.10. It can gain substance by pointing at the Moon and its obvious influenceand announcing that if the Moon can influence the tides, behavior, etc.,then so can planets, stars, etc. likewise influence Earthly situations.This is the very successful trick used by stage magicians: If one swordcan be thrust through a previously-inspected object which rests withina cabinet, and afterwards the object is removed and shown to havebeen speared through by the sword, it is therefore assumed by theaudience that the pretty girl who then gets into the cabinet will bethoroughly impaled by the succession of swords - in addition to thefirst one - which follow. We must not forget that at one time it wasproclaimed that the Moon contained lunar armies, strange ships sailingon lunar seas, and was even made of green cheese - while the same“experts” also knew the subtle influence of distant planets upon theEarth!11. It can appear valid, in that people do act the way their astrologicalsigns infer they must. It is a fine case of the tail wagging the dog - theplanets having nothing to do except provide a rationale for the dogmaof astrology; the dogma, not the stars, acts as the controlling factor.- 832 -- 833 -Appendix 19: The Command to Look- by Stephen E. Flowers, Ph.D., V° Temple of SetReprinted from Runes #IV-3, Order of the Trapezoid, 1986819In the Charter of the Order of the Trapezoid, I read that one of AntonLaVey’s primal source works for the principles underlying the Law of theTrapezoid and hence the Order itself, was a book by William Mortensen:The Command to Look. I had never seen nor heard of this book before, so Iset out to find it. I was on the track of the Trapezoid, which is sometimes anelusive trail. As I began looking, I soon discovered that The Command toLook was no arcane Black Book, but appeared in the University of Texascard catalog as a book on photographic techniques. My interest wanedslightly. Besides, the only copy was in the Humanities Research Center,which is also home to much of Aleister Crowley’s personal library. Thatalways means red tape. I put off my quest for a few weeks.Weeks turned into months before I moved myself to take up the trailagain. After finding the right collection on the right floor, and after sittingthrough the required slide show on how to handle rare items in thecollection. After the librarian asked “Are you sure you want to do this?”, Iknew I was on to something.I was shown to a private reading room where I finally got the book -presumably dug out of some unseen vault. It was laid before me in aPlexiglas “cradle”, which is to prevent damage to the tome. What did I see?There on the cover of a small book, I was confronted by the face of a babylooking like a refugee from a Norman Rockwell painting. The librariansarcastically remarked, “Looks real interesting !”Since I had gone that far, I opened the book, I did not now expectmuch. But I was very much surprised. The Command to Look is indeed atreasure trove of the Black Art, and the ideas contained in it should bemade available to the Order not only on historical grounds, but also on thebasis of their practical magical value.819 This essay is also contained in Black Runa, a collection of Dr. Flowers’writings forthe Order of the Trapezoid, published by Runa-Raven Press, P.O. Box 557,Smithville,Texas 78957.- 834 -TheoryMortensen insists that the main premise of the Command to Look(CTL) is closer to pure showmanship than anything else. The formula isthreefold:(1) The picture must, by its mere arrangement, make you look at it(impact)(2) and, having looked, see! (subject interest)(3) and, having seen, enjoy! (participation)All three of these elements must be fully activated before the artist - ormagician - can be said to have successfully “commanded to look”. All three,however, work in such rapid succession that it is almost always effectedunconsciously with regard to the viewer. Therefore the artist must carefullyformulate his images to work efficiently in all three elements.The first element - impact - is psychically coercive. Its function isentirely one of the shapes or patterns the viewer sees. It forces the viewer topay attention to the image. This initial force, which Mortensen calls “thepictorial imperative”, is the force necessary to overcome the natural inertiaof attention which holds most humans in a more or less constant grip."},{"pageContent":"According to Mortensen, impact is purely biological in effect. It isprimarily dependent on shapes or patterns that serve as stimuli signalingdanger. These fear-arousing patterns must have their psychic modelsstored in the forms within the “racial memory” or, to use the Jungian term,“collective unconscious” of humanity.Mortensen identifies four basic types of pictorial patterns that have theability to cause this reaction:1. The diagonal, e.g. the lightning bolt = something that moves swiftly withdetermination2. The S-curve, e.g. the snake (something that approaches in a slitheringfashion) or the curves of the body (especially female = “the line of beauty”)3. Triangle combinations, e.g. a blade, sharp points, or teeth (= the threat ofsharpness)4. Compact dominant mass, e.g. large animal or trapezoid (= massiveblock in one’s path)Again it can not be overemphasized that these patterns are purelyformal and have nothing to do with the dominant themes of the images. For- 835 -example, if one drew the outlines of the basic contrasts in a black and whitephotograph and examined them in a purely geometrical way, the “pictorialpattern” would be obvious. More than one category of pictorial patterningcan be present in any given representation as well.The second element - subject interest - must now be able to “deliver”what the successful application of the pictorial imperative has promised.Many images, or magicians, may command to look, and then be quiteunable to hold the attention they have attracted.This is done through the actual subject of the image, moving from theexternal form to the internal essence of the thing. According to Mortensen,in order to hold the attention - in order to make the viewer see - he or shemust at once be able to recognize something basically and essentiallycompelling about the subject.For all practical purposes, this recognition must occursimultaneously with the impact. Therefore the types of subject interestsmust have as broad an emotional appeal as possible.Mortensen cites the great showman, Cecil B. De Mille, as saying thatthe formula for box office success is to have a film dealing with sex,sentiment, religion, and sport. Mortensen reduces this somewhat to threesubject themes: sex, sentiment, and wonder. It is Mortensen’scontention that their compelling nature make them the most effectiveimagematic themes in the CTL.The sex-theme seems to dominate; it certainly does in Mortensen’s ownwork. In commenting on the gender of the subject of the sex-theme image,Mortensen says: “It is interesting to note that women are just as muchattracted to the theme of sex when presented in the form of the female nudeas men are. Their attraction in this case is vicarious, rather than direct.Their pleasure comes in imagining themselves placed in a situation wherethey would receive the same admiration that goes out to the theme of thepicture.” (p. 37)The sentiment-theme is usually effected through the softer aspects ofsex, children, hardships of humble life, domestic life, animals, landscapes,national pride, glamour of the past, etc.The wonder-theme is quite broad and covers the areas of unknown,uncertain, mysterious things, as well as themes of the supernatural, themacabre, etc.Themes can, of course, be effectively mixed. Some permutations, suchas “sex + wonder”, might be more immediately effective than “sex +- 836 -sentiment”, but as with all forms of communication, it would seem thatknowledge of one’s potential “target audience” is the essential variable.It should be obvious that the effective use of the CTL is largelydependent upon the æsthetic compatibility of the nature of the impactpattern and subject matter. Interesting mixtures are also possible here.The third element of the CTL-formula is participation, the elementthat causes the looker to experience - and thereby enjoy - what he or sheis seeing. This is done, according to Mortensen, by drawing the viewer’sattention into the image by means of lines - geometrical alignments - thatcause a movement of those attention patterns in accordance with theimpact and subject matter of the image.Mortensen comments that the eye of the looker will naturally movealong contours and outlines, and that such geometrical guides should beprovided by the image-maker in ways compatible with the impact linesand the subject matter. This is what he would call “confirming forms”.The image-maker must, with this third element, confirm the promisedsubject matter after having “commanded to look” in the first place with analmost pure “shock element”.PracticeThere are at least three ways to apply the principles of the CTL (1) inthe creation of graphic or spatial images (e.g. photographs, drawings,paintings, rooms, chambers, etc.), (2) in Lesser Black Magic, and (3) inGreater Black Magic.The first application is obvious and primarily what Mortensen had inmind. The work of Edward T. Hall, e.g. The Hidden Dimension, is avaluable supplement to the CTL in this regard. Of course the design of aTrapezoidal Working Chamber could not ignore these principles either.In reading Mortensen’s book the Black Magician probably could notescape the feeling that these principles could be applied outside the contextof the graphic or spatial arts.If indeed these principles are “biological” or part of the “racialmemory”, could they not be employed when the Black Magician considershow to present himself or herself when working Lesser Black Magic? Itseems that the CTL contains a comprehensive theory on how to get - andhold - the attention of someone on an unconscious level. What, then, theBlack Magician does with that attention is another matter. When one looks- 837 -around, however, it is clear that the CTL is being employed by a variety ofindividuals, both consciously and unconsciously, all the time.Finally the CTL can be used in Greater Black Magic. The BlackMagician can use its principles to impress more effective images within thesubjective universe and thereby have a greater or deeper effect in theobjective universe. Also any objective manifestation of this process - in anobjective image constructed according to CTL principles - will be a morepowerful tool in effecting Greater Black Magic.This is where the Law of the Trapezoid comes in. If we analyze the Sealof the Order, we will see a (Grand) Masterful application of CTL principles:the “swiftly moving diagonal” at its center (the head of the tcham-scepter),the “threat of sharpness” throughout (note especially the interlockings ofthe numerals with the angles of the pentagram and the “W” at its netherpoint), and the “dominant mass” implicit in the trapezoid itself.The Black Magical applications of the CTL seem virtually boundless,and it is to the credit of Anton Szandor LaVey, first Grand Master of theOrder of the Trapezoid, and perhaps the greatest magical genius of thiscentury, that he was first able to extract the practical magical applicationsfrom Mortensen’s æsthetic theories.- 838 -- 839 -Appendix 20: Ceremony of Satanic Baptism- by Anton Szandor LaVeyParticipants1.

Celebrant recites the First Enochian Key.10. Celebrant:“In the majestic light of undefiled wisdom, awake and enter into theArcadian Wood, wherein all thy lingering falsehoods shall be as deadbark stripped from thy trunk, where thy futile hypocrisies known andunknown shall no longer envelop thee in mind and body. Cast off thywhite robe of lies and confront thy Prince revealed as thou once beganlife, undraped and unashamed. Thou mayest breathe again that firstbreath now as night winds freshen from the far reaches of Belial.”11. The Initiate arises, disrobes, and is seated in the chair provided, hisfeet supported by a footstool.12. The Celebrant passes the flame of a candle four times under the soles ofthe Initiate’s feet, saying as he does so:“Through this, the Black Flame of Satan, thou walkest in Hell. Thysenses are awakened to the joy of rebirth. The Gates are flung wide, andthy passage is heralded by the deathless cries of his guardian beasts.His searing brand shall be evermore emblazoned on thy consciousness;its fiery meaning shall make thee free.”13. The Celebrant gestures with his hands in recognition of the Air ofEnlightenment as he pours incense into the brazier. He intones:“We bring of thy garden, O mighty Lucifer, the fragrances whichabound therein. Vapors of millennia which thou hast shared with thychosen flock are rekindled now to fill this chamber with thy presence.We toll the bell in thy name and thereby summon the whispering voicesof wonder from all the regions of thy empire.[To the Initiate:] “Breathe of his breath, O brother of the night, andnourish thy yearning brain. From the despair and agony of thy former- 842 -direction, thy new path is tonight set forth in all the brilliance ofLucifer’s Flame. His zephyrs now guide thy steps into the ultimatepower which knowledge brings. The blood of those who fail is eternallybright on the jaws of Death, and the hounds of night pursue theirhapless quarry relentlessly. They who walk amongst us bear deceit;verily they shall perish in blindness. Turn thy back on the vile, andfollow the Black Flame to unending beauty in mind and body.”14. The Celebrant removes a sample of the soil from the container andspeaks while pressing it back and forth against the Initiate’s soles andpalms:“Now, as before, when the mother of us all cushioned our paths withthe pure, pagan silt of ages, she offers herself anew. As thy true role ofEarth-child emerges and pervades thy being, return for this and alltime thy feet to her bosom. Revel in the shimmering glow from thehearth of thy heart, and make thy pact of devotion with all her childrenwhose paws have tracked and learned the way of Belial. Seek and beglad, for infinity speaks only to those of self-realization who know andhear and heed the law.”15. The Celebrant anoints the Initiate with water from the sea and speaks:“From the arid wastes and bleaching bones and nothingness, thoucomest into our midst. With swollen and parched lips thy search forwords of truth hath led thee to the shrouded and misty, subterraneancaves of Leviathan. It is from this brine that all life springeth forth. Theseas are within thy body just as surely as they surround and sustain allthe nameless creatures of the deep. And the substance of Dagonresideth within thy flesh. And so thy travel passeth through the brinyabode. Arise now and wrap thyself in the black robe of darkness,wherein all secrets abide.”16. The Initiate stands and dons the black robe.17. Celebrant:“This Baphomet medallion which I now place around thy neck sealsfrom this time forth thy eternal commitment to His Infernal Majesty- 843 -and thy unyielding loyalty to the Order of the Trapezoid of the Churchof Satan. Raise thy right hand in the Sign of the Horns, and receive this,thy oath:”18. Celebrant:“Thou, having forsworn the divine mindlessness, do proclaim themajesty of thy own being amongst the marvels of the Universe. Thourejectest oblivion of self and acceptest the pleasure and pain of uniqueexistence. Thou art returned from death to life and declarest thyfriendship with Lucifer, the Lord of Light, who is exalted as Satan.Thou receivest the Sigil of Baphomet and embracest the Black Flame ofthe Order of the Trapezoid. Thou dost bear true faith and allegiance tothe Church of Satan and to the person of His Excellency, the HighPriest. Thou standest, under severe penalty of destruction and ruin, tosafeguard the secrets of the Church of Satan and its membership fromany and all persons who may seek information as to the structure,ritual, magical teachings, or any other workings of the Church whichare not a matter of public knowledge. Thou hast assumed this Infernalcommitment of thy own volition, without let or hindrance, this actbeing done without coercion and of thy own desire and according to thywill.” 82119. The Celebrant faces the Initiate and, with sword in hand, describeswith its point an inverted pentagram. It is traced in the air directly infront of the Initiate’s chest and newly consecrated medallion.20. The Celebrant and the Initiate face the altar and give the Sign of theHorns. The Celebrant verbalizes: “Hail, Satan! Hail, Satan! Hail,Satan!” The Initiate repeats each exclamation.21. Tolling of the bell: pollution of the air.22. The Celebrant extinguishes the Black Flame and intones: “So it isdone.”821 This oath was composed by Michael A. Aquino III° and first used in theChurch ofSatan’s Nineveh Grotto, 1970.- 844 -- 845 -Appendix 21: Revelation of the Beast -Aleister Crowley in Theory and Practice- by Michael A. Aquino III°The modern apprentice of the Black Arts will find it very difficult toavoid the legacy of Aleister Crowley, England’s notorious Gœtic personalityof the turn of the century. Although his ascent to prominence in occultcircles often displayed scant finesse, Crowley attacked and demolishedexisting institutions in order to replace them with the new, not merely froma sense of sheer nihilism. The issue before the Church of Satan is, of course,whether Crowley can be endorsed as a philosopher and magician, orwhether his practices were so far divorced from his theories as to renderhim simply a quaint and colorful eccentric.One must remember that an occult devotee of the Victorian era facedan even more dismal wreckage of source material than does hiscontemporary counterpart. The young Crowley seized upon the doctrine ofthe Great White Brotherhood not necessarily as an accurate reflection of hispersonal attitudes, but as the device most conducive to his education andinfluence in practical magic. The structure of this Brotherhood was toremain the key to Crowley’s personal achievements throughout his entirelife; consequently it merits a capsule description for the unacquaintedreader:The Brotherhood was originally conceived as a sort of organizationalgodhead, embracing the “higher” philosophies of the world’s occult andreligious elements. It was composed of three successive orders of magicalexpertise: the Golden Dawn, the Red Rose & Golden Cross, and the SilverStar. The aspiring member was confronted with eleven grades within thoseorders, ranging from Probationer through Philosophus (G.D.), AdeptusMinor through Adeptus Exemptus (R.R. & G.C.), and Magister Templi,Magus, and Ipsissimus (S.S.).Advancing rapidly through the first two orders, Crowley becamedisenchanted with the methods of his tutors, essayed a rather violentschism in the London-based Golden Dawn, and struck off on his own torealize his proclaimed destiny as the Beast 666. He interspersed worldwidetravels and mountain-climbing expeditions with sensational love affairsand bizarre ceremonies of his Magick. He quickly became notorious as botha drug fiend and a Neroesque poet, either sufficient to tarnish his welcomein England. He eventually emigrated to the Mediterranean, where heorganized an abbey to disseminate his philosophies, but a scandal involving- 846 -the death of a young assistant inspired the Fascisti to order his deportation.Crowley returned to England, where he resided in a modest fashion untilhis death in 1947.So much for simple biography. Regardless of the flamboyance of hislife, Crowley might have become just another of history’s more intriguingcharacters were it not for his extraordinary dissertations regarding himselfand his beliefs. During the course of his lifetime, he published anabundance of articles, essays, and books; but perhaps the most revealing ofhis works are his autobiography Confessions and the famous Magick inTheory and Practice.The most immediate impact of these volumes is the vast expanse ofCrowley’s familiarity with the world’s occultisms. He not only refers withconversational ease to the Cabala, the I Ching, the Ennead, and the Koran,but he experiences no difficulty in reconciling them to one another. All suchworks, apparently, are accounted for in the overall scheme of theBrotherhood.As a practicing magician was Crowley Black or White? He maintainedthat he worked to bring about an altruistic evolution of mankind into his“Æon of Horus”, yet his Law of Thelema recognized neither good nor evil.Of the Prince of Darkness he remarked:The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothersto imply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who hadunity would be a God. ( Magick)- yet he claimed that Satan, under the name of Aiwass, was his personal“Holy Guardian Angel” in the White Brotherhood. He denounced the Left-Hand Path thus:A [Black Brother] is gradually disintegrated from lack of nourishmentand the slow but certain action of the attraction of the rest of the Universe,despite his now desperate efforts to insulate and protect himself, and toaggrandize himself by predatory practices. He may indeed prosper for awhile,but in the end he must perish. ( Magick)- yet he himself indulged in excesses that would do credit to the mostzealous Satanist. Was Crowley simply a pompous hypocrite, then, or wasthere a secondary purpose behind such literary bombastics?Enter the Paradox of the Beast: Crowley is inconsistent, but anIpsissimus is by definition a man-god who need recognize no laws of logic- 847 -or reason external to himself. And, presumably, Crowley’s right to this titlecannot be contested save by another who possesses the rationale ofIpsissimus. Regarding the validity of his methods, Crowley himself says:I admit that my visions can never mean to other men as much as they doto me. I do not regret this. All I ask is that my results should convinceseekersafter truth that there is beyond doubt something worth while seeking,attainable by methods more or less like mine. I do not want to father a flock,tobe the fetish of fools and fanatics, or the founder of a faith whose followersarecontent to echo my opinions. I want each man to cut his own way through thejungle. ( Confessions)In view of both such a statement and the Paradox itself, a conclusivecriticism of Aleister Crowley is well-nigh impossible. Some categoricalobservations, however, may be advanced to clarify this enigmaticgentleman’s true nature:I. Crowley’s major literary works, while occasionally downrightbewildering, are ultimately consistent in themselves. There is, in otherwords, no evidence of classic schizophrenia; Crowley’s deliberate andenduring enthusiasm for Magick reveals a professional sense of dedication.He regularly records blunders, failures, and fiascos together with hissuccesses; and an appreciation for balance is not absent from his work.II. Crowley’s assertions have been subject to the same mangling byover-enthusiastic disciples (psychic vampires, if you will) that has warpedall revolutionary philosophies since the beginning of history. The Sataniccritic is advised to evaluate the words of the man himself, not theinterpretations of his “fools and fanatics”. It might well be argued that evenJesus Christ was a Satanic Master of his time - he wreaked a good deal ofhavoc with both the Judaic and the Roman state religions in favor of a morehumanitarian approach - and that it was mainly his institutionalresurrection and enforced imposition upon later eras that twisted anddegraded his name and philosophy. Crowley, like Christ, must be seen infour dimensions.III. When studying Crowley, let one remember the example of Milton,whose genius produced perhaps the most magnificent Satanic epic of alltime - the immortal Paradise Lost - under such adroit camouflage that itwas not only accepted but acclaimed by Cromwellian England. Crowley’sultimate statement is glaringly diabolical, and only the most mulish criticwould continue to plod resolutely along the Right-Hand Path into theunderbrush of the Beast’s literary labyrinths.- 848 -IV. Finally, Crowley dealt with concepts that are among the mostdifficult to express in the English language. Accordingly he is not beunderstood without an effort on the part of the reader. Consider theintended message in each statement, not only its literal representation, andperhaps Crowley will attain full recognition as a true Ipsissimus and SatanicMaster of mankind.We must be constantly on our guard against egocentric implications;they do not even exalt the ego as they pretend to do, they limit it. We becomegreat just so far as we are able to liberate ourselves from the constriction ofour normal conception that we are men. When one has crossed the Abyss,especially, one should be altogether free from the prepossession that one’sbody and mind are more than inconvenient instruments through which weperceive the Universe. To increase our understanding of the cosmos, we mustconstantly endeavor to counteract the limitations which the fact that ourinstrument is a human being seeks to impose upon us. ( Confessions)- 849 -Appendix 22: Beyond the Abyss- by Michael A. Aquino III°Part I: PerceptionThe Abyss: the Ultimate Mystery. Since the dawn of man it has existed -the ethereal chasm between that which man can systematize and that whichis infinitely beyond the reach of his most advanced mathematical estimates.The scientist can deduce the answer to What, and he can at least supposethe answer to How, but he is a hopeless idiot savant groveling before theWhy.And so Why became a variety of gods, and then one god, and finally anirrelevance to modern materialists. Man’s conceit maintains remorselessparity with his supposed achievements, and more often than not the light ofhis knowledge is eclipsed by the glitter of his prideful pomposity.The occult tradition has its faults and its frauds, but it has nonethelessnurtured and sustained the concept of the Abyss - and of that which liesbeyond. As crazed as they are with the broken and twisted remnants ofman’s earliest sciences, the old mythologies invariably suggest that thereexists a final limit to the laws which delineate man’s perceptual universe,and that the answer to the Why is to be found in a more exalted sphere ofconsciousness.The experimentation and the divination have been both stimulatingand pathetic. Who, indeed, has failed to muse over the deadly intoxicationsof samadhi and nirvana which tantalize the orient, or the cripplinghallucinations of artificial psychoses induced by the pharmacies of the morematerialist civilizations? Look - and behold the Right-Hand Path, whichleads ever to delusion, regression, introversion, and self-destruction! Enteryour cathedrals, your monasteries, your synagogues and chapels, yet knowthat you have stretched out your hand but to seize the opium pipe. God isnot dead; God is Death - and only the very few are able to recognize andshun his final, ecstatic embrace.Man, say the theologians, has a task to fulfill, a “divine mission” toaccomplish before he may receive his final reward from God. He is createdaccursed, and thus he shall perish save for the most strenuous penance onhis part. He must strive to disembowel his very mind, to accept the mostinfantile rationale as rigid truth, and to reduce himself to an eventual stateof such blissful idiocy that there can be no return for him.- 850 -The Church of Satan has silenced the Myth of the Mission. We are Men;we have no mission; we are our own mission. We are, and our future isinfinite.But in our fear and ignorance we cling desperately to that which wethink we can predict. We are a race of compulsive gamblers, and we laymassive odds upon the “laws” of reality. And all the while we areunavoidably the children of un-nature, who again and again violate our own“laws” of existence to suit our unique dispositions. True, over the ages wehave evolved in health, longevity, and refinement, but the final distinctionbetween man and his bestial comrades upon this Earth is far moreelementary: It is our ability to concoct and conceive the impossible, theparadoxical, the illogical, and the inconsistent.Upon first consideration this may not seem to be so significant anaccomplishment. But think: Is it not this compulsion to achieve theimpossible that has driven man to effect his many victories over theunknown? Has not every genius of history, whatever his interest, begunwith the simple desire to do what others proclaimed could not be done?Whence came this surrealist madness, this atonality in the Great Harmony?Satan, some say, is but a symbol of ourselves as we are in our innatebestiality; he is natural man, primitive man - the hairless ape.Can they not see that, were man to reject his uniqueness, he wouldagain blend within the natural mindlessness of the cosmos, losing alldistinction and identity? Such is no challenge to God - such is rather ahysterical submission to the very force they so arrogantly disdain. Wouldyou become a beast or a god?If Satan is nonexistent, what then is the origin of this unnatural infinityof man’s intellect? Can one view the achievements of his race and doubtthat we are possessed of something far greater than the mere, methodicalcycles of the Natural God?“My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” cried a dyingcarpenter’s son, whose genius became paralysis as he surrendered hisSatanic Mastery to a vain trust in the very forces of nature he had rejectedin his teachings. For the spirit of his God was to be found not only in thefields and flowers of his youth, but in the nails and timbers of the cross thatclaimed his body. And in ironic truth the god had not forsaken him; it hadfinally come to demand its own.Ever the Gift is offered, and ever it is tasted, feared, and thrust backinto the hands of the ArchDæmon. Man is terrified by the suggestion of his- 851 -potential divinity, and only the Brothers of the Left-Hand Path seize uponthe Gift as the inspiration of their existence.What must the ancients have seen in the eyes of Christ when he calledupon them to rise above the horrible destiny of man’s animal existence?And what horror must have crossed his face when he screamed out hisdreadful, final understanding that he had not seen far enough - that theenchantment of his words had been due not to the indifferent mindlessnessof God - but to the Challenger and Enemy of All God, the verySatan whom he had denounced and damned!I speak of Satan not as a god, nor as a tyrant, for he has naught todesire from the labors of man. We are rather his dream and his legacy, forhe would cast down the universal unity of God and see created an infinity ofuniverses, a triumph of variety. Out of the Fire he spoke to me, and I haveseen his Light in the eyes of the Guardian of his Order. Satan is not fantasy- He is terrible, formal reality, and if you mock him through falseworship, better far that you had fawned before the God of Death, for then atleast you should win pity for your madness!The path through the Abyss is fraught with uncertainty, loneliness, andthe ever-present fear of futility. Many have despaired and turned back tothe security of God, or have turned aside to the compromises of therationalists or the sanctuaries of the Old Craft. But those who cross do notreturn, though their natural shells seem the epitome of normality. For theyare the Lords of many universes, and none is of greater worth than another.This is the Bond of the Gift of Satan, and in this Bond rests the ultimateconsequence of man.Part II: PresumptionThe Presumption of the Church of Satan, and of its Order of theTrapezoid, is that the most effective approach to the psychologicalevolution of man is through organizational coordination tempered by aconscious emphasis on individualism. Thus the Presumption might be saidto constitute a reapplication of the theories of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, et al. toexistential empiricism. To incline to either extreme, however, would be tocourt a disastrous loss of progressive analysis, as the student of Satanism ishighly vulnerable to the exhilarating ecstasy of intellectual amorality.The Self-centered practitioner inevitably loses an appreciation for hissocial environment, with the consequence that he becomes an outcast, a“madman”, or at best an eccentric whose opinions are categorically- 852 -dismissed by the recognized intellectuals of his time. Such a fate overtookmost of history’s announced Black Magi - from Pythagoras (whose famousacademy was burned by an outraged mob, and who later perished at thehands of another mob) to Aleister Crowley (who was evicted from his abbeyin Sicily and died amidst popular ridicule in England).The danger of a diametrically-opposed approach - i.e. a regimentationof the philosophy to the effective negation of individual responsibility - iseven more sobering. Here we witness the legacies of Buddha, Christ,Mohammed, Cæsar, Hasan, Horbiger, and Lenin, whose intensive,dogmatic disciples embarked upon crusades of ideological carnageunparalleled in human history - and often, ironically enough, nonessentialto the designs of the original theorist. And here also are the nightmarishresults of theological future-shock: hysterical fanaticism born of anabruptly introduced, radical philosophy inciting its followers to run wild inthe name of utopian revelation until the weight of the social median oncemore enforces a return to the preexisting norm.Thus the Brother of the Left-Hand Path confronts perils of a quitesubstantial nature: on one hand the probability of personal persecution,and on the other a terrible distortion of his visions by those whose intellectdoes not temper their loyalty. But once more is the Abyss to be braved - andthis time by the most Presumptuous of challengers: the Fellowship of theOrder of the Trapezoid.It is the Order’s very approach to this venture that shadows it inenigma. Through the external representations of the Church of Satan itsatisfies the public of its social “harmlessness”, thus freeing its membersfrom the first danger of the Abyss itself. Secondly, through the mercilesscondemnation of all forms of intellectual slavishness, it attacks theinsidious germs of fanaticism that would become cancerous parasites uponits energies - the very elementals of psychic vampirism that constitute thesecond peril of the Abyss. And only if all who aspire to the Black Order areforewarned of these encounters can they presume to their mastery.The Abyss indulges neither ignorance nor misunderstanding. Shouldone be cast into its depths, even the most lucid of ultimate revelations willnot serve as protection. To the Order has come the Call of Satan, but it isnever given twice. To dare the Abyss - to seal the Pact with Satan - is theultimate risk, and it presumes either the assumption of godhead itself orthe damnation of madness and death to the unsuccessful. Yet only to theLeft or to the Right may the Paths be pursued, for there is none to thecenter.- 853 -Would you view the prophets of the Right? They scream from theasylums of humanity - from the most distinguished institutions of secularsociety to the crazed and pathetic circles of the White Witches … from thebrutish delusions of the natural materialists to the mindless suffocations ofthe monotheist religions. Their spells are as enchantingly intoxicating asthe softest powders of heroin, and the Brethren of the Right-Hand Path areas Wells’ Eloi, who descend to the caverns of death with their featurestwisted in frenzied delight.And what of the Lords of the Abyss - those who have mastered the ViaSinistra? Many are dead - the price of untimely recognition by the profane -but others wander amidst the majesties of their Creations, returning onlynow and then to the mundane rationales of the God-cosmos that they mayspeak of the Gift of Satan to others who seek the Gate.And the Gate? Search for it in the Temple of Universal Peace AmongMen: TEMpli Omnium Hominum Pacis ABhas, whose inverse is the Seal ofSatan and the definition of the Trapezoid of the Black Flame, wherein riseagain the Great Halls of Ba-neb-Tett and the Sphinx that is Ya N’ke Eros’E.Part III: AssumptionAfter the Brother of the Left-Hand Path has perceived the potential ofthe Gift of Satan and has presumed to its most extensive exercise, whatthen? How may he know when he has finally crossed the Abyss andassumed the mantle of his divinity? It would be Self-contradictory to turnto an endorsing agency for this decision, yet even Satan’s own Self-evaluation in this same matter precipitated his downfall in the SeraphicWar. The ironic question so often posed to the god of the Christians isbefore the Satanist as well: If you assume your infinity, how can you professto know your Self?The aspirant may choose to ignore the formal issue entirely, pursuinghis own philosophy for its hedonistic satisfaction alone. Such an approachis both Self-fulfilling and non-hypocritical, since the practitioner presentsno claims to be contested. The anonymity of most of history’s SatanicMasters is due to just such a decision on their part - to enjoy the fruits oftheir expertise without seeking to formalize it in the public eye.But in the case of the Church of Satan, such an option is not alwaysappropriate. Individuals who participate in the experiments of the Churchare expected to determine the skills and standards most beneficial to thosewho follow them. In this way the Church serves as a university in the most- 854 -literal interpretation of that term. The autocratic structure of the Church,correspondingly, is practical only if the selection and authorization of itsleadership within the Order of the Trapezoid reflects both a Platonicrecognition of individual potential and an Aristotelian appreciation for thevariance in individual techniques.Evaluation of Black Magical excellence is the prerogative of the HighPriest alone. As a Magus of the Order he has not only assumed the personalattributes of a Satanic Master but has forcefully applied them to society insuch a fashion as to impress his Will upon the mechanics of the God-cosmos … this by changing the entire concept of Satanism from a randomindividualism to scholastic cooperation. Such a modification of Diabolismhas succeeded in unifying the criteria applied to each Initiate’s degree ofAdeptship; the standard employed is that of abstract mathematics [hencethe formal title of the Order]. By determining the individual’s appreciationof the concepts and relationships embodied in the trapezoid and itsgeometric derivations, one Master may recognize another without regard topersonal disciplines or emphases. [The reader is advised that Euclid’stechniques alone are definitive. Remember Orpheus!]The primary difficulty involved in explaining the higher philosophies ofthe Church of Satan is that their very essence defies categorization.Confirmation in the I° and II° is determined by the individual’scomprehension and application of the basic tenets of the Satanic ethic. TheIII°, IV°, and V°, however, are progressively more obscure; they involvearcane methodologies which are often patently bewildering to those whoseintellectual dispositions are still subject to reason and rationale.Let us return to the original question of the existence of Satan. Foreither the lay philosopher or the Satanic novice a definitive resolution isrequisite to the satisfaction of his curiosity. To the Satanic Master, however,the very question is its own answer; the person of the ArchDæmon is heldin such regard that the answer’s articulation would be both undulyrestrictive upon the disposition of the Master himself and futile insofar asthe understanding of those who are yet before the Abyss are concerned.Suffice it to say that the existence of Satan is positive in itself; it is not acreation of mere negation.There are those who seek to allay their frustration with a “sign”. Theirsis more the folly, as the Infernal Grail appears only when its existence is nolonger a subject for debate. And yet it is not the wish of this writer tobemuse the reader. If you would aspire to Mastery of the Abyss - and toyour personal divinity - you are commended to the following propositions:- 855 -I.Return question with questions inspired thereof; all answers arearrogance.II.That which is Essential to your existence, rule. That which is not,ignore.III.Bend Time to your Will, else it shall bend you to your death.IV.Seek not to travel to your ambitions, but rather to summon them toyou.V.Know not the emotion of mercy, but rather the art of appreciation.VI.Reject all promise of satisfaction; accept that of irritation.VII. Scorn the moral and the rational, for reason is but vanity.VIII. Respect the motives of others, and seek to include them in your own.IX.Do What Thou Wilt, yet subject thy lesser Wills to the greater.X.Approach infinity through indefinition, not definition.* * *The Abyss of Hallucinations has Law and Reason; but in Truth there isno bond between the Toys of the Gods.This Reason and Law is the Bond of the Great Lie.Truth! Truth! Truth! crieth the Lord of the Abyss of Hallucinations.There is no Silence in that Abyss: for all that men call Silence is itsSpeech.This Abyss is also called “Hell”, and “The Many”. Its name is“Consciousness”, and “The Universe”, among men.But THAT which neither is silent, nor speaks, rejoices therein.- Aleister Crowley, The Book of Lies- 856 -- 857 -Appendix 23: Post-1975 Flier for The Compleat Witch- by Anton or Diane LaVeyAnton LaVey’s most blasphemous book, The Compleat Witch, or WhatTo Do When Virtue Fails, is out of print and has been unavailable. We havemiraculously obtained an undiscovered cache of the original hardcoveredition, new with dust jackets. If you are unfamiliar with The CompleatWitch, it is understandable. Published in Italy as La Perfetta Strega, itbecame an immediate source book for international trend-setters. TheAmerican hardcover edition, despite extensive promotion and distribution,quickly and mysteriously disappeared from dealers’ shelves. This was in1970-71. A paperback edition appeared and soon vanished from the stands.The book had bestseller status, glowing reviews, yet seemed to besuppressed in spite of its success. Why was it taboo? Read it and you’ll see.In seeming contradiction to its title, The Compleat Witch is not the usualtype of occult-oriented manual. It is a guide to human archetypes, foibles,eccentricities, and how to recognize and manipulate them. It is a book oneeither loves or hates, nothing in-between. To some it presents a series ofworkable formulas. To others it holds a mirror up which reflects shunnedimages. It pulls no punches and defines what many dread to know.It has been a major underground influence of the ’70s for style, fashion,behavior, and attitudinal change. Single paragraphs have inspired entirearticles and books by other writers. Its effects on opinion makers and trendsetters can be seen by the most sheltered of readers. Copies of TheCompleat Witch were sometimes thrown away or destroyed in disgust.More often they were furtively stashed. It was the kind of book one read butdidn’t share, which is the highest testimony to the efficacy of its “forbidden”knowledge.It would be difficult to list the names of all the books which have spunoff The Compleat Witch yet safely avoided its most abrasive material. Thenumerous, recent manuals on body language, sensual enchantment,character reading, power attainment, etc. are quite tame by comparison.The Compleat Witch is not porn yet more offensive to many (who considerthemselves sexually liberated). The Compleat Witch is not academic yetmore instructional than the most advanced college text on behavioralpsychology. The Compleat Witch is not didactic yet contains laws that anyreader who is bold and/or perceptive enough can readily prove valid. TheCompleat Witch, though directed to women, is equally valuable to men. TheCompleat Witch, though written from the most Machiavellian, Satanic- 858 -viewpoint imaginable, has offended the sensibilities of many professedSatanists who unreservedly accept the tenets of the Satanic Bible.Combining the awesomeness of the unknown, tricks of misdirection,appeals to compulsions and fetishes, others’ personal preferences, analysesof voice, odors, and outward appearance, The Compleat Witch defiescategorization and is more than a book. It is a series of monographs boundin one volume which is useful and entertaining, whether one is as aspiringor practicing witch or warlock, merchant, analyst - anyone dealing withpeople or just watching from the sidelines. The Compleat Witch, while ourstock lasts, is priced at $15. It is already a collector’s item, and the FirstEditions we have will steadily increase in value.

Aquino III°Satan encompasses all of man’s inborn qualities, attributes, and talentscarried to an infinite perfection. Æsthetic appreciation as well as legitimate,subjective artistic creation can be basic dæmonic gifts. Not every talent forart creativity, however, should be placed in the Satanic category. The BlackFlame of the Dark Prince radiates from very few contributions born of thatimmense arena of human imagination. So it follows that only the individualwho accepts Satan and who has completed his orientation to Hell carriesthe potential to recognize and æsthetically appreciate the dæmonicdonations to an otherwise bland society bulging with restricted, frustratedabilities.Great self-discipline is necessary to alienate oneself from the propheticpressures of religious and moral inhibitions. As a result, galleries of artexhibit the works of artists who follow strict schools or styles of creationthat hold to tight regimentation of what is and what ought not to beconsidered “talent”. These stifling ropes are being severed by the freethought and expression championed by the Adversary, yet the greaterpercentage of work shown in exhibition halls still includes inane canvassesdepicting fruit, dead-pan portraits, plastic madonnas, and even the uselesssplotches of color exemplified in the common conception of modern art.The essence of true magical beauty lies within both the absolutefreedom of human imagination and an incorporate use of unusualmovement or underlying theme that pricks at man’s latent curiosity.Regrettably, popular conceptions of the Accuser’s artistic tastes dwellwithin the repulsively morbid, i.e. “Transformation of Sorcerers” by Goya,“The Ritual Kiss of the Sabbath” by Guaccius, or “Reading the Black-Book”by Franz van der Wyngaert. These men, accompanied by otherinnumerable, vampirized talents, were all unduly pressured by clericalauthority. Their representations of the practitioners of the Left-Hand Pathwere given censorial sanction or else would have been burned along withtheir respective creators. Therefore all art depicting dæmonic acts or ritualdoes not automatically warrant the “Satanic Seal of Approval”. All evidenceof subjective imagination, in these cases, is left waiting at the chapel door.When dealing with aspects of the macabre, artists exhibiting Hellishinsight sidestep a large amount of serious morbidity and instead deal withthe ghoulish side of existence as an element of black comedy orsuperstitious ridicule. In many instances the theory implying that only- 868 -hideous, sub-human monstrosities inhabit the Pit is completely rejected,and instead Satan and his disciples are portrayed as beautiful beingsdisplaying perfection in physique and demeanor.The illustrations by Gustave Doré which were used in several editionsof John Milton’s Paradise Lost are excellent examples of artistic magic. Thetribunes of Hell are presented in a magnificent fashion rather than asvictims of unspeakable chromosome mutation. Doré encourages the viewerto “wander through” each illustration and to contemplate what newexperience lurks behind each shadow. Salvador Dali uses a similar type ofsubtle turbulence in his compositions. The turmoil of Dali’s work is moreevident than that of Doré but no less effective. Vincent van Gogh employshis dæmonic gift particularly in his later works (such as “Vincent in theFlames”). His work attempts to explain the complexities of the ego. And themore contemporary sculptures of San Francisco’s Bufano force one to exerta considerable effort to interpret the graceful, bizarre lines.Illustrators of both adults’ and children’s fairy tales often displaydæmonic talents. In these instances an otherwise subdued imagination isdrawn out. The dark humor of Marc Simont’s illustrations for Thurber’sThe Thirteen Clocks - from ambivalent rabbits who tip their heads ingreeting to the curious Golux - appeal to adult Satanic tastes. And suchphysiological magicians as Dr. Seuss allow children to exercise youthfulfantasy through unusual and grotesque imagery.All of these men, by the introduction of distinctive styles and originalthought, allow the individual to travel along unmarked paths found in theircompositions instead of being “tied off” at eye level by strict rules andartistic regulations.It should be noted that the true masters of Hell automaticallyappreciate the beautiful elements in life. They not only recognize diabolicalauthority but, through the use of their arts, regularly practice artisticpursuits with a high degree of excellence. Black Magi such as Levi, Crowley,and LaVey are all noted for genius in art as well as in literature and music.They illustrate what man can effectively accomplish after first acceptingand then fully utilizing the gifts of the Æsthetic Adversary.- 869 -Appendix 26: “Speaking of the Devil”- by Becky Homan, Staff WriterThe Louisville Times, page #A3, May 20, 1971Just as the devilish-looking person got off his plane at Standiford Field,the theme song from Rosemary’s Baby came across the canned musicsystem inside the terminal. It was pure coincidence.This man with the shaved head and black clerical collar was AntonSzandor LaVey, Devil of the ritual scene in Rosemary’s Baby. He’s also aDoctor of Satanic Theology and High Priest of the worldwide Church ofSatan. He came to Louisville recently, not to preach but to relax and visitwith 25 members of the local Satanist Grotto.“I’m not a kook,” LaVey said later, over a lunch of chicken a la king.“I’ve had my fill of the trappings that people attribute to us. We Satanistsdon’t fit their popular concepts of witches and warlocks.”Beyond his own sinister looks, LaVey is a relaxed and witty man of 41years. He loves Gothic architecture, nostalgia; and he practices what hepreaches … indulgence.He enjoyed his food and continued talking about his philosophy. Hesaid Satanism doesn’t deny God. Rather it calls God’s church hypocriticaland instead glorifies man as his own deity. “Why should people feelashamed of anything that gives them pleasure,” LaVey argued, “as long as itdoesn’t hurt anyone else?”He admitted that Satanism is not for everyone. “Some men mightpump up their egos too far, out of control, like a Frankenstein’s monster.”He laughed at this analogy.LaVey established his church in San Francisco in 1966 but was areligious cynic long before then. He traveled with carnivals and burlesqueshows for many years. “The carnival taught me all the foibles of humanbeings. People want to be deceived and scared,” he said. “They all want ashort cut - something for nothing.”From his experience as a criminologist with the San Francisco PoliceDepartment later in life, LaVey also saw “the sordidness of man in his mostnegative aspects”. He established his church as an expression of his feelingsabout the nature of man. Now he’s a consultant to movies on the occult, andhe’s written several books on the subject, including the Satanic Bible.He recently returned from a tour with his most recent book onwitchery. “The book stresses the concept that the most successful witches- 870 -are women who don’t even know they’re witches,” he explained. “They’rehousewives and mothers, and they charm and enchant all day long.”- 871 -Appendix 27: Regional Agent Program Letter- by Anton or Diane LaVeyJune 1, VI/1971I have been instructed by the Council of the Trapezoid to inform you ofcertain policy changes which will be made known to the generalmembership sometime within the next month. After having conducted athorough review of the membership files, the Council have selected a smallpercentage of our membership to whom this letter previewing their policyrevisions would be sent.You were chosen as a possible aide in the activation of their plan, butonly the members of the governing Council are aware of the reasons foryour selection. The purpose of this letter, therefore, is to brief you on therole for which you are being considered and to determine whether you areinterested in accepting the position.As you may recall, a few months ago we proposed a plan wherebymembers would be further encouraged to communicate with one another …or so we thought. Our intention was to publish the names and addresses ofmembers, in addition to their membership numbers which the presentsystem provides. Surprisingly, despite the added convenience this wouldhave offered those who wished to contact others, the majority of ourmembership expressed little enthusiasm for the idea. Therefore the planwas not put into effect, but the “experiment” was a success. For what wasrevealed about the bulk of our membership is directly related to thepurpose of this letter.We have arrived at the conclusion that in order to combat the apparentlethargy with regard to members’ working towards establishing a morecohesive and formidable organization, we must not allow them to remain“tied to the apron strings” of the Central Grotto.Hence it has been decided that our discontinuation of theCommunication Roster, a new format for the Cloven Hoof [which will not“spoon-feed” the Satanic philosophy and magical principles to its readers],and the cessation of our correspondence with members on personal matterswill do much to relieve the sense of apathy among our ranks.We have reached the point where we must work towards tying togetherthe loose ends of our organization if the Church of Satan is to continue itsintended evolutionary process. In order to do so, we must decentralize asmany functions of the Central Grotto as is feasible at this time. Services areno longer held at the world headquarters in San Francisco, nor do the- 872 -operations of the governing Council depend solely upon the existence of theCentral Grotto.The building at 6114 California Street in San Francisco serves only asthe main business bureau and clearing-house for all mail addressed to theChurch of Satan from anywhere in the world. It is the responsibility of thestaff of the Central Grotto to relay all official announcements to themembership, to state our philosophical views on matters which we believeare of general interest to the members of our Order, and to offer themefficacious magical principles which will enable them to realize their fullpotential as human beings.The foregoing will explain why we have elected to appoint certainqualified members to act as our agents - Satanic ambassadors of sorts - inareas where we have no functioning Grotto nor anyone who is serving in thecapacity of official representative. In areas where we have quite a number ofmembers, it is difficult to determine why we have not been approached byat least one who is qualified to establish some level of cohesion amongstthem.Perhaps it is due to an apprehension that one might appearpresumptuous were one to request permission to act as an officialspokesman for or representative of the Church. Or possibly there is agenuine sense of self-doubt insofar as being capable of meeting therequirements for the position is concerned. On the other hand, it may bedue to precisely that which is mentioned above: lethargy or procrastination.This letter is intended to help us find out and to rectify the situation. Wealso trust that this letter will have a slightly prodding effect on thosecapable of leadership, thereby motivating them into action.Since those serving in the capacity of local Agents will have very fewactual responsibilities, and since their progress within the Church from thatpoint depends entirely on how much effort they wish to put forth and ofcourse on their individual capabilities, we are not concerned with how longa person has been a member. As a matter of fact, quite a number of thoseselected to receive this letter are relatively new members.Because an Agent will - at least in the beginning - be acting merely as a“contact” for others in his or her area and will not be expected to performany complicated tasks, we can afford to be less stringent with regard to thenecessary qualifications than we can when appointing a Grotto Leader. Thisis one reason why we feel very positive about what we have begun; we arecertain it will give many members an opportunity to develop potential thateven they themselves do not realize they possess. And it cannot help but- 873 -benefit the entire membership, for we are bound to discover individualswho will be of great value in the furtherance of the Satanic cause.The attached sheet will describe to you what is entailed in serving as alocal Agent of the Church of Satan. As you will discover from the materialwhich is enclosed, you may use your Agent’s position as a stepping stone toother realms within the Church, or merely continue to act in the capacity ofan Agent only. The choice is yours. We would greatly appreciate it if youwould send your reply to this query within three weeks after you receivethis communication. Thank you for your continued support. May our DarkLord shed His Infernal Blessings upon you.Rege Satanas!John M. Kincaid, Minister of InformationPurposes and Benefits of AgentsPrimary Purpose: To act as a “contact” for others (members and/ornonmembers) in a given area, and to relate to the Central Grotto all mattersconcerning those individuals, thereby acting as a middleman between themand the Headquarters of the Church of Satan.Specific Duties: Correspond and/or converse with members and/ornonmembers concerning Satanic principles, i.e. philosophy, ritualprocedure, and subjects relating to Satanism and other areas of the occult.File a monthly report on your contactees. This should be two to fourtypewritten or legibly-printed pages containing general information onprogress, capabilities, initiative, comments, questions, suggestions, etc. ofall members under your jurisdiction. The only correspondence whichmay be sent directly to the Central Grotto by a member of your groupshould be merchandise orders, membership renewals, and changes ofaddress. This will be of great assistance to the staff of the Central Grotto, asit will enable them to attend to the extremely important matters which willhave far-reaching effects on the entire membership of the Church of Satan.We would also be interested in receiving any local news items of a pertinentnature.Conduct informal group discussions and [if feasible] rituals inaccordance with the standard procedures set down in the Satanic Bible.Benefits: Acting as local Agent, you will be in the position to receiveannouncements previewing policy changes, notification of media coverage,etc., as well as special consideration with regard to any correspondence youmay send to the Central Grotto.- 874 -A twenty percent ($5) commission for each new member youpersonally recruit.If you succeed in organizing a well-functioning group and in solicitingnew members for the Church, we will far more readily consider you for theposition of authorized Grotto Leader should you wish to apply. In otherwords, “action speaks louder than words”. The type of person who can takeit upon himself to form regularly-meeting groups [whether merely fordiscussion or actual rituals as well] possesses the potential for leadershipfor which we look in prospective Grotto Leaders.Note: Your main duties would of course pertain to the registeredmembers in your area. But for one reason or another, occasionally we maywish to inform a nonmember how he may contact our local Agent. Whetheror not you wish to be contacted by nonmembers is relatively unimportant,but we would like to have your permission for this should the need arise.- 875 -Appendix 28: “An Encounter with the Church of Satan”- by Grayson H. Ensign, Professor, Cincinnati Bible SeminarySeminary Review #XVII-3, Spring 1971Satan exists! He lives and moves in this world; and our Lord JesusChrist identified him in John 8:44 as a liar, a murderer, and the father oflies. Paul, by the Spirit, declared that Satan disguises himself as an angel oflight (II Corinthians 11:14). He is the god of this world for the time being(II Corinthians 4:4). Jesus our Lord says of some religionists, “You are ofyour father, the Devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.” (John8:44) In the book of Revelation (2:9) we are told that there was a “church(synagogue or assembly) of Satan” in the city of Smyrna.But although Satan does exist and though he has great power, he is notinfinite or unlimited. Satan or the Devil [the terms refer to the sameperson] is under the ultimate, moral government of God. This is made clearin the ancient writing, the Book of Job. In the very first chapters of thisbook we learn that Satan reports to God, answers to Him, has to getpermission to do his evil acts of temptation, and is limited in the extent ofthe attack he can bring against anyone.Again in Romans 8:37 we are told that we are more than conquerorsthrough Him who loved us. We are given the assurance that God “will sooncrush Satan under your feet” (Romans 16:20). Christians have the powerthrough Christ to overcome the church of Satan and all Satanic forces.Indeed, it is more certain than death that Satan’s destruction is assured. Heis not going to conquer or prevail. The mighty Christ declared even while hewas on the Earth, “I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning” (Luke10:18). In Matthew 25:41 we are told the eternal fire is prepared for theDevil and his angels. The Devil is thrown at last into the lake of fire andbrimstone and tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation20:10).In the light of the biblical teaching concerning the reality of Satan andthe actual existence of a church of Satan at Smyrna, and in the light of thetremendous apostasy, permissiveness, moral delinquency, and acceleratingsinfulness of our day, it should surprise no one that there exists today avisible and outward manifestation of Satan’s power, namely a church orassembly of Satan. This article is my report of and my reflections upon arecent encounter with a representative of this contemporary SatanicChurch.- 876 -I. Confrontation with a Priest of SatanThis experience began when I was asked to appear with a Priest fromthe Church of Satan on a radio interview program, of which Ron Cordell isthe host, on station WFKY in Frankfort, Kentucky on January 28, 1971.Since this invitation came to me about two days before the interview was tobe held, I had very little time to do thorough research on the subject ofSatanism and on this “First Church of Satan of San Francisco” in particular.It was very difficult to locate anything of definitive value. So I went toFrankfort on that January afternoon quite ignorant of the cult and of thenature of the planned format of confrontation with the Priest of Mendes(Satan).The one thing I did not go in ignorance of, however, was my Lord andthe power of His Word. This was my confidence, that whatever might besaid, the Word of God would be adequate for the occasion even if I werenot. The Word of the Lord is “living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit … and able tojudge the thoughts and intentions of the heart ”(Hebrews 4:12, NASV).It was comforting to recall the words of our Lord Jesus Christ to Paul,instructing him to go to me “to open their eyes so that they may turn fromdarkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, in order that theymay receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who havebeen sanctified by faith in me.” (Acts 26:18) Let us remember that the Wordof God is the truth, that it is the dunamis (dynamite) of God in all ourconflicts and controversies, and that it cannot be broken. It opposes,exposes, and finally subdues all anti-God forces, philosophies, and systems.When I arrived in Frankfort, I found that a Christian on the radio staffhad been instrumental in the decision to extend an invitation to a Christianto be a part of the interview. A Christian preacher in Frankfort took me tothe studio, where we met a man whom I will call Michael. Michael is fromLouisville, Kentucky. He is 23 or 24 years old, married, and has a 3-year-old daughter. He supports himself in some kind of work and does not takemoney as a priest of the Church of Satan. (This is allowed but is left up tothe local priest.)Michael is very personable, intelligent, and articulate. He is a collegegraduate, a veteran of Vietnam, and an ex-member of a Protestant- 877 -church. 822 His father was a Roman Catholic; his mother was anEpiscopalian. 823 He talked freely about his views and convictions before theprogram began. From listening to his conversation with station personnel, Igained some information about the ideas and teachings of the Church ofSatan.Michael used a pseudonym, “the Reverend Charles Ward”, becausethere were still some narrow-minded people around, he said, who mightgive him and his family a difficult time. He was permitted to give a postoffice box number in Louisville for any who might be interested in writingfor information, while I was afforded the privilege of giving the address ofthe Cincinnati Bible Seminary.Ron Cordell, the host, and another WFKY staff member did theinterviewing; thus there were four of us involved. The interview beganwithout any statement of how it was to be conducted or how anyone was tocontribute. Michael naturally did most of the talking. The program also hadsome telephone calls from the radio audience and some time out foradvertisements. Actually the fifty minutes allotted for the programpermitted very little time for real confrontation or dialogue, especiallybetween Michael and me.The chief value of my appearance on this program, it seems to me, wasthat I had the chance to represent [unofficially of course] the Lord JesusChrist and that vast body of Christians who would be utterly opposed to theChurch of Satan. I was able to refer to Christ, God, and the Bible; and to adegree I was able to negate or contradict some of the statements thatMichael made. Thus attention was given to the fact that what was beingoffered was contrary to the Word of Christ. This in itself was of definitevalue, according to the Christians who listened to the program.The greatest opportunity for me personally came after the programwhen I had a chance to tell Michael, “Christ loves you, and you shouldbelong to Christ. What you are expressing here, namely your hatred anddislike for organized religion and churchanity, is akin to some of myfeelings; but what you are really looking for is Jesus Christ and the simple822 I was never affiliated with any church prior to the Church of Satan,although I wasbaptized by the Lutheran Pastor Niemöller shortly after my birth, when hevisited SanFrancisco.823 Actually my mother was a [nonpracticing] Swedenborgian, and my father a[nonpracticing] Catholic.- 878 -truth he has given. Michael, you really ought to consider accepting JesusChrist.”He replied that he knew a good deal about Jesus Christ and had respectfor him, but that he simply could not follow him on a lot of things. Aftersome further conversation, we went to dinner - three Christians only andtwo members of the Church of Satan. For an hour or more we engaged insome of the most serious and personal dialogue in which I have everparticipated. I thank God for this opportunity.Off the air Michael was much more serious and direct. He admittedthat some of the activities in which the Satanic church engages may tend tobe a clowning, sardonic, satirical mockery of religion. Michael expressedthe thought that the Church of Satan was acting as the Devil’s advocate andthus doing some good by exposing the follies of Christianity and organizedreligion. I replied that this might be of some value, yet it was a negative sortof thing. “Why don’t you do positive good by being a Christian, just a simpleNew Testament Christian? That is all you have to be. We don’t have tobelong to anybody except Christ, and we can really serve mankind bestthrough Jesus Christ.”The other Christians did a great job of witnessing to Michael and hissecretary concerning the restoration principle, the joy of being Christiansonly, and the blessings that are found in accepting Christ. I believe that thiswas something quite new to Michael; and hopefully a fruitful train ofthought was established for the future, for Michael was serious about thediscussion. He did not accept what we said, but there was no irreverence orcareless disregard of what was presented to him.It was a happy and exciting experience to get to know this man and hisfriend, and to have this frank and personal discussion that got to the veryissues of our lives. You may be sure that Michael has been on my heart andin my prayers ever since.II. The Church of Satan and Its BibleIndirectly a major benefit of this experience was the gaining of afirsthand knowledge of the Church of Satan from a person who is a veryarticulate spokesman and who has been fully indoctrinated and ordained toits Priesthood. I use these terms carefully and will try to give an honest viewof this cult and its teaching.The High Priest (or Black Pope, as some call him) of the Church ofSatan of San Francisco is Anton Szandor LaVey. He is apparently the self-- 879 -appointed Priest of this Satanic Church. He claims to be a Doctor of SatanicTheology, which presumably is also a self-conferred title, though the Devilmay have had some part in his action. LaVey is the author of the book TheSatanic Bible, a paperback book of 272 pages published by Avon Books, adivision of the Hearst Corporation of New York City. [Page references citedin the text below are from this book.] It is the document used by all theassemblies of the cult, which are usually referred to as “Grottos”. One mustexamine a copy of this book in order to understand this false religion, this“organized religion” which is attempting to take the place of organizedreligion.By no means do I suggest that everyone buy a copy of the Satanic Bible.It is not something to treat lightly or carelessly. As a Christian one wouldnot want to repeat some of the things in this book because they are Satanicand blasphemous. What is said is derogatory of God and honors the Devil.The Church of Satan does not “worship” the Devil, according to Michael,but they have greater respect for the archdemon than they do for JesusChrist. Satan is more worthy of worship than God, the cult says; Satan caresfor us [i.e. he wants us to enjoy ourselves] while God does not care for us.As proof that God does not care for us, Satanists use the old argument of allskeptics: the suffering, pain, and agony of this present life in the world.From what I have learned from Michael and from the Satanic Bible, Inow want to give as broad and adequate a view of this cult as I can, thoughit will have to be condensed to a large degree.First of all, their meetings are not open to the public. Only memberscan attend. [Michael indicated that there were approximately twentymembers in the Grotto at Louisville.] Anyone can become a member afterhe is interviewed, examined, and qualified. Just what standards must bemet in order to qualify, I do not know. After one qualifies, he pays a $20membership fee, which goes to the High Priest LaVey. [If there are about20,000 members of the Church of Satan, as is claimed, then LaVey must bechuckling all the way to the bank with the $400,000 from the victims whohave swallowed his fraudulent system.]The local Priest can make money, if he wants to, from funerals,baptisms, or weddings; and people can give him gifts. Apparently mostPriests support themselves and do their Satanic bit as their avocation.The ritual and ceremonies used are largely developed as a mockery orlampooning of church rituals, especially the Roman Catholic. It is said thatthis is not the old “black mass” where the host from a Roman Catholicbuilding is stolen or a baby may be sacrificed. The cult disclaims any- 880 -association with that sort of thing and does not sacrifice babies or animals,having too great a respect for them.Yet from reading the Satanic Bible, one must conclude that the ritual isthoroughly anti-biblical and blasphemous. Its procedure for calling up thePrinces of Hell (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) is evidence of thedesire for the forces of evil to be involved in the ritual. The Devil (or Satan)may not be “worshipped”, but he is honored and prayed to for theindulgences requested by the worshipper. Since the Devil and his evilspirits are very real, these people in their sophisticated unbelief andconceited naïvete may well become deeply involved and compromised inbody and spirit through the power of the Devil. What may begin as cleverplay, caricature, and mockery of reality through anti-god factors maybackfire and result in tragic consequences for the participants. I believe thatpeople can deliver themselves over to the Devil and be finally consumed ofhim. The Devil is more clever than his followers, the Satanists, and therewill be a pay day for them even though they may not be looking for it.Each Grotto can “do its own thing” and follow what it wants to, up to apoint. The Satanic Bible is the guide, but there is considerable freedom inits use. Michael said that in the examination he took to become a Priest, onequestion was, “If the High Priest issues you an order or sends you adirective which you do not agree with or accept, what should you do?” Hesaid that the expected answer was that one was to ignore it or tell the HighPriest that he would not carry it out. Of course, if there were violentdisagreement or opposition, then a Priest would be expected to resign orperhaps would be fired.In the ritual meetings of the cult, a nude woman is usually used as thealtar, although she may be scantily clothed if it is felt best according to thelocal mores. In the Satanic Bible (p. 135) the reasons for this are given.Essentially it is meant to emphasize the fleshly rather than the spiritual inthe meeting, and it directs attention to a central focus. Woman is seen assymbolic of the world mother and as sexually stimulating. There is a strongemphasis upon sexual stimulation and action, though again this might varyfrom Grotto to Grotto. In any case it is obvious that this type of thinking,ceremony, and activity would be the antithesis of the spiritually-orientedChristian meeting.The details of the Satanic ritual are given on pp. 133-140, where theauthor describes the layout of the room, the appropriate dress, the altar,and the position of the woman. There are the ringing of a bell, prayers toSatan, drinking from a cup called the “Chalice of Ecstasy”, and other- 881 -dramatic actions with symbolic meanings. The very ancient pagan practiceof honoring the phallus is a part of the cultus, though it is optional. Thispandering to the carnal nature of people identifies this religion with thatwhich existed in the days of the prophets of Israel and which wasthoroughly denounced by them. Indeed, Satanism is not new.There are three main ceremonies which may be performed as requestedor as needed. These are a ritual to achieve sexual desires, a ritual to assuresuccess or help for a person who is an object of compassion [includingoneself], and a ritual for the destruction of an enemy. The first and third ofthese are utterly selfish, and the second one could well be in many cases.This is true to the character of this religion of darkness, for it does not denyits selfish egoism and self-indulgence.Then requests (prayers) are submitted verbally or in writing. Thewritten requests are burned in one or the other of the candles. There is onewhite candle to the right of the altar which symbolizes the hypocrisy of“white light ‘magicians’” and people who follow the “Right-Hand Path”. Inthe white candle the curses are burned, while the “blessings” and requestsfor success are burned in the black candle. Black represents the Powers ofDarkness which Satanists hold to be superior to the light or God.This activity is followed by readings from the Satanic Bible in thesection called the “Enochian Keys”, and this is used in order to indicate theallegiance of the people to the Powers of Darkness.Concerning the originator of this particular Church of Satan [theoriginal began with Cain], in 1966 Anton LaVey decided to set up a religionand a Church of Satan. He said that so many were living for Satanism thatthere ought to be a church to which they could belong and which could helpthem to develop the fullness of the life of Satan’s followers. Hiscongregation is supposed to include some of San Francisco’s most solidcitizens.LaVey, who played the role of Satan in the witchcraft movieRosemary’s Baby, says he came to the conviction that the Christian churchwas built upon hypocrisy and that man is so constituted that his carnalnature will always dominate his life. After studying magic and the BlackArts, LaVey developed an organized system of words and ritual drawingupon magic and the Forces of Darkness (Hell). He called it a churchbecause it gave him “the magic formula of one part outrage to nine partssocial respectability needed for success. The main purpose was to gather agroup of like-minded individuals together for the use of their combinedenergies in calling up the dark force in nature that is called Satan.” (p. 17)- 882 -Also, LaVey’s church was to be a place where the things of the flesh andthe carnal desires of man could be worshipped and celebrated. Instead ofabstinence there would be full indulgence of everything that a personwanted to do up to the point of hurting someone who does not deserve orwish to be hurt. As stated in the prologue of the Satanic Bible (pp. 23-14):A glow of new light is borne out of the night, and Lucifer is risen, oncemore to proclaim: “This is the Age of Satan! Satan rules the Earth!” The godsof the unjust are dead. This is the morning of magic and undefiled wisdom.The flesh prevaileth, and a great Church shall be builded in its name. Nolonger shall man’s salvation be dependent on his self-denial. And it will beknown that the world of the flesh and the living shall be the greatestpreparation for any and all eternal delights! Rege Satanas! Ave Satanas!Hail, Satan!It is easy to see that the Church of Satan is the antithesis of the Churchof Christ. Marcello Truzzi has characterized the Church of Satan asespousing:“... an elitist, materialist, and basically atheistic philosophy … a worship ofone’s own ego … In its major features the Church of Satan takes the position ofextreme Machiavellianism and cynical realism towards the nature of man …This Satanist, then, is the ultimate pragmatist.” ( The Occult Revival asPopular Culture)Burton H. Wolfe is quoted in the introduction to the Satanic Bible asfollows: “There is no altruism or love-thy-neighbor concept in the Satanicreligion, except in the sense of helping other adherents of the Black Path togain their desires by group energy. Satanism is a blatantly selfish, brutalreligion.” (p. 18) This is borne out by many statements in the Satanic Bibleitself, especially in the sections entitled “Infernal Diatribe”, “Love andHate”, and “Indulgence … Not Compulsion”.Morally and ethically, then, the Church of Satan encourages the sinfuland selfish in man. It is permissive, situational, and immoral in its basicreasoning and consequences. The Satanist is taught that he cannot loveeveryone and should hate his enemies and those called “psychic vampires …those who drain others of their vital energy”. He should indulge in the so-called seven deadly sins as they lead to gratification. These “sins” were onlyinvented by the church to make people feel guilty, because everyone finds itimpossible not to commit these “sins”.- 883 -The ritual of destruction plus the chapter entitled “On the Choice of aHuman Sacrifice” is clear evidence as to the extremely unChristian attitudeof Satanists toward other human beings, who become objects of hatred. TheSatanist, with sudden and illogical moral “conscience”, recoils in horrorfrom the idea of sacrificing any animal or baby, declaring that it should be"},{"pageContent":"done “under no circumstances” (p. 89). Animals and infants are the “purestform of carnal existence” and are “natural magicians” for whom theSatanist has “sacred regard”. Man, the animal, is said to be the godhead tothe Satanist. But nevertheless certain men, your enemies, may besymbolically destroyed. “Symbolically the victim is destroyed through theworking of a hex or curse, which in turn leads to the physical, mental, oremotional destruction of the ‘sacrifice’ in ways and means not attributableto the magician.” (p. 88)In answer to the question as to the proper human sacrifice, the SatanicBible declares that it is anyone who has unjustly wronged you, causedtrouble or hardship to you or those dear to you. “In short, a person askingto be cursed by his very actions.” (p. 89)… Therefore you have every right to [symbolically] destroy him, and ifyour curse provokes his actual annihilation, rejoice that you have beeninstrumental in ridding the world of a pest! If your success or happinessdisturbs a person - you owe him nothing! He is made to be trampled underfoot! If people had to take the consequences of their own actions,they would think twice! (p. 90)III. Evaluation of the Church of SatanIn conclusion, let us list some evaluations of this Church of Satangained from reflection upon this firsthand experience with one of its Priestsand from study of the Satanic Bible. First it seems to me that this religion ison one level a kind of hoax, a big joke, a make-believe exercise such aschildren engage in through imaginative play. It smacks of an undergroundlodge with entertaining trappings, hocus-pocus, and tongue-in-cheek talk.It seems to be a kind of “kick” that is enjoyed by these people, most ofwhom are young; it has the appearance of a fad that attracts some as drugsor Zen Buddhism attracts others.Second, on another level this religion is a serious thing for thoseinvolved and for our culture. What may begin as make-believe and fun canbe used of the Devil to ensnare the minds and spirits of the adherents. TheDevil has many ways of working to capture those who have been created to- 884 -glorify God and enjoy Him forever. The Devil is much more clever than anyof the Satanists might be aware of. A silken thread of contact with evil mayin time grow into a steel cable of enslavement to carnality or selfishness ordepraved wickedness. This Church of Satan could begin as a game for some,but it could turn out to be a fatal game.Third, the Church of Satan is clearly contrary to the Word of God and isanti-biblical. God’s revealed will does not permit us to play around withsuch anti-God premises, positions, and actions. All Bible-believing peoplemust denounce this cult as something evil, destructive, and blasphemous. Itshould be fought against with all the spiritual weapons at the command ofthe Christian. Its members need to be confronted with the claim of JesusChrist upon their lives along with a genuine love and concern for them asfellow sinners for whom Christ died. In time some of these are going to tireof this sick sinfulness, or the realities of life are going to come crashingintotheir lives with such force that they may be wide open to the graciousinvitation of Jesus Christ. We need to sow the powerful seed of the Word ofGod, and let God develop it.Fourth, the religion of Satanism is anti-Christ, the very antithesis of theteaching of Christ. It actually mocks Christ and denies Him through itsteaching, its practices, its attitudes, and its life. No Christian can be a partof this group. A clear-cut choice is forced upon one to following either theLord Jesus Christ or Satan. That decision is the most vital decision anyoneever faces and needs to be honestly and intelligently faced by everySatanist.Fifth, the Church of Satan is a relative of ancient Baalism, a type offertility cultism in modern dress. Baalism produced the most carnal, sinful,and degenerate kind of Canaanite religion. It was unceasingly condemnedby the Old Testament prophets. It was self-destructive and brought aboutthe destruction of the Canaanites. With some refinements, this is what isbeing presented to modern man as a way of life. But it is a way of death.Man is not merely an animal. He is not to live by bread alone nor by fleshalone. Man is both body and spirit, made in the image of God, and finds hishighest good in the unselfish use of his body and spirit in doing the will ofGod to the upbuilding of his fellow men.Sixth, the cult of Satanism is neo-Gnosticism. It is the pridefulexaltation of man’s puny thought and the repudiation of God’s revealedwisdom. It is man’s foolish listening to Satan as he whispers the ancient lie,“You shall be as gods.” Autonomous man has always been his own worstenemy. There is no salvation in human knowledge apart from the absolute- 885 -standard of God’s revealed truth. The philosophical basis of the Church ofSatan is without validity and will not endure the test of time. It is notadequate to live by and gives nothing to the individual to die by. The writerof Hebrews clearly warns us, “… it is appointed for men to die once, andafter this comes judgment … How much severer punishment do you thinkhe will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and hasregarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified,and has insulted the Spirit of grace? … It is a terrifying thing to fall intothehands of the living God.” (Hebrews 9:27; 10:29, 31, NASV)Seventh, the religion of Satanism is false and contradictory in itsteaching. By its denial of the eternal God, the Absolute Being, it destroysany objective basis for truth. It builds on the sand of relativism and hencehas no objective validity or authority. By denying God and all moral law, itdiscards any right to speak meaningfully of human ethics or values. Yet itattempts to make value judgments and imposes some moral restrictions onbehavior. On the one hand it speaks of complete freedom of indulgenceaccording to one’s one desire and yet says that Satanism “… does notadvocate rape, child molesting, sexual defilement of animals, or any otherform of sexual activity which entails the participation of those who areunwilling or whose innocence or naïvete would allow them to beintimidated or misguided into doing something against their wishes” (p.70). Perhaps the escape word is “advocate”. From its own a-moralconstruction, no Satanist could say to another, “You ought not to do thatthing.” It would be meaningless and absurd within the system. By whatauthority could a Satanist speak against some vile, inhuman action save byhis own whim, prejudice, or silly hang-up?I asked Michael about this inconsistency in the matter of moralitywithin the cult. I suggested to him that what he was actually doing -because he had some strong convictions about his wife and daughter’swelfare and moral health - was “cheating on his own system of thought” bysneaking in the back door some ethical convictions held over from histhinking as a church member. Every Godless system of thought or world-view must end up as a reductionism without values, leading to moralanarchy. The Satanist would have a terrible time living in a society whichwas committed to Satanism. He could not fairly seek to prove to some otherflesh-worshipper or Satan-inspired person that he should not try to taketotal advantage of his person, possessions, or family. Having taught theglorification of might over right (p. 34-35), the Satanist has set himself upfor his own exploitation and destruction from the stronger, more a-moral,- 886 -predatory animal which he calls man. He might attempt physically todefend himself or those dear to him. But to attempt to reason about right orwrong would be to deny his own accepted system of thought. To beconsistent with his a-moral philosophy, he must accept his fate withphilosophical delight and rejoice that someone is proving to “be a better(more consistent) Satanist than he”. [The Christian rejoices when theconvert he has made to Christ exceeds him in commitment to Christ and incarrying out the will of Christ.]In other words, I believe that the moral position of Satanism is acontradiction in terms and utterly meaningless. It may be titillating to thesophisticated modern to ridicule the God-given standards of right andwrong in the artificial and make-believe environment of his Grotto, but inthe full light of day-to-day living, a person cannot long live by such aphilosophy.Eighth, this Church of Satan is a warning to each Christian to workmost diligently to become a vital, Christ-like person. All of us have to admitthat we are not living the kind of consecrated spiritual lives of witness thatwe should be living when a false and valueless system like Satanism cangain adherents among Americans. If we were really letting our light shinebefore men and if we were truly lifting up the Light of God, then we knowthat darkness would be banished.Ninth, this cult is a challenge to every congregation of Christians to bemore zealous in its outreach in love with the good news of truth,deliverance from darkness and true joy in living Christ. At the same time itis a clarion call for us to get back to essential, biblical Christianity so thatthere will not be drop-outs such as Michael to become the tools of Satan.Obviously there is serious failure in the congregations and in the Christianhomes to teach and practice the life and love of Jesus Christ when the“Michaels” of the churches quit in disgust and hostility. Maybe the Churchof Satan will shock us all into a new awareness of how inadequate much ofour teaching is and how far we are from a vital, spiritual, experiential unionwith Christ. The Church of Christ has never had a greater challenge fromdesperate men and women than it has today.Tenth, the Church of Satan will not do a huge amount of damage in andof itself. It will not attract very many Christians, even of a weak variety. Itwill be a bad influence on sick sinners who are floundering in the morass ofmodern nihilism. We as Christians must see that more damage is beingdone to the souls of men and to the cause of God in the world by those whoare living sinful, unrepentant, unrebuked lives while at the same time they- 887 -are members in good standing of a congregation with a sign over the doorof their meeting-house, “Church of Christ”. The lack of integrity bycongregations claiming to be Christians will send more souls to hell than allthe congregations of Satan in the land.- 888 -- 889 -Appendix 29: Excommunication of Wayne West- by Anton or Diane LaVeyOn the twenty-sixth of September VI A.S., Wayne Forrest West, a Priestof the Church of Satan, was excommunicated by authority of the Council ofNine, Order of the Trapezoid. Mr. West is thereby divested of any and allauthority in matters terrestrial pertaining to or concerned with the Churchof Satan, Order of the Trapezoid.The Council of Nine, Order of the Trapezoid has received the formalresignation of Wayne Forrest West from his position as Priest of Mendes ofthe Church of Satan. Mr. West’s announcement was imparted four daysafter the Central Grotto was appraised of the situation by a number ofmembers in the Detroit and Dayton areas. We wish to express our gratitudeto those individuals who contacted the Central Grotto immediatelyfollowing Mr. West’s announcement that he had decided to terminate hisassociation with the Church. We apologize for any confusion or distresswhich Mr. West’s lack of protocol in this matter may have caused themembership.While we dislike seeing any member leave who has shown ability incertain areas of Satanic endeavor, we realize that reasons undoubtedly existfor any such departure. Mr. West has expressed disgruntlement over whathe regards as a cutback in the authority given members of the Priesthood.This complaint has been lodged before by others who have left the Churchof Satan and their positions of authority herein. Invariably these instancesoccur when it becomes evident that other, erstwhile “lesser” members havebegun to prove themselves not only capable, but often exceptional in rolespreviously limited to the disenchanted authority figure. In short, no onelikes to see others become too capable at something to which he has heldchampionship. This, essentially, is the crux of the present situation.Mr. West has done a fine job in establishing and developing the Detroitand Dayton Grottos while presenting a colorful public image for theChurch. In exchange for these admirable feats, he felt he should have beenelevated to a higher position, admittedly that of the IV° - the equivalent ofBishop. He also felt he should have had complete control over all Grottosestablished by him. This in itself was not an unreasonable assumption onhis part. Whether Mr. West concurs or not, however, the requirements forthe IV° are substantially more than the formation of one, two, four, twelve,or a hundred operating Grottos. Secondly, and far more likely to be apainful object lesson, complete control over anything is difficult at best. In- 890 -a philosophy like Satanism, all the force in the world will not make othersmarch to the leader’s tune. The very independence and freedom of will thatcharacterizes the movement would be in direct conflict with the methodsand motivations of such a bureaucratic power figure. The only alternative(or adjunct) to forced control is respect gained through admiration.Admiration cannot be demanded, bestowed through commission, or gainedby a title.The position of Priest of the Church of Satan carries with it a title not tobe taken lightly. It is not intended that the “Peter Principle” should affectthose who have shown the magical awareness required to attain thePriesthood. In view of what has transpired of late, it would appear that theCouncil acted wisely with regard to Mr. West’s aspirations [or expectations]toward his elevation to the IV°. One who has shown himself incapable ofmaintaining the emotional and mental stability commensurate of the role ofPriest of Mendes could hardly expect to be given any degree of authorityover others beyond that of which he had - at the time - appeared to becapable. Simple and uncluttered standards, these - really no different fromthe most fundamental requisites of any legitimate organization orbusiness. For this reason, while we regret the loss of a Priest, we also realizethat the decision - as well as the problem - was his, not ours.We therefore charge the following to be the reasons for Mr. West’sresignation:1 - Inability to attain his desired status. Rev. West had repeatedly statedthat he intended to become a Bishop in the Church of Satan [andencouraged some, if not all of his members to refer to him as such]. He didwhat he felt was required to attain this degree, actual standardsnotwithstanding. He was not elevated in accordance with his wishes, simplybecause he did not meet the existing requirements.2 - A sense of “restriction”. He had the impression that his control overothers had been hampered and that those around him were acquiring equalstatus and respect. Rev. West ruled his Grottos with an iron hand - in factmore so than any other Priest of the Church of Satan had been allowed todo. He thought his authority was slipping and so attempted to convinceothers of restrictions that do not exist!3 - “Biting off more than he could chew.” He had gotten himself intodeep water by such actions as retaining monies for his own use which wereto have been forwarded to Central Grotto for merchandise ordered bymembers under his aegis and for applications he sponsored. He issuedrulings, citing Central Grotto as his authority, when no such directives had- 891 -emanated from the Central Grotto. He assumed the title of Bishop when nosuch title had been granted him. He made promises which have remainedunfulfilled. He stringently forbade all members under his aegis tocommunicate with the Central Grotto, leading them to believe suchcommunication would be unwelcome - regardless of the purpose of same. Itis quite obvious why he employed this shrewd maneuver, knowing that ifcertain of the members did contact the C.G., stories would conflict! Rev.West’s house of cards began to fall apart when a directive was issued to allAgents and Grotto Leaders [including those under his jurisdiction]requesting direct [albeit with carbon copies to Rev. West] communicationwith the Central Grotto.4 - Insufficient opportunity to feather his own nest through Churchincome. Rev. West was the only Priest who was not engaged in an outsideoccupation or profession which could comfortably support him. This is whyhe projected such hostility towards other Priests whose identities had to bemore carefully guarded. He had nothing, materially, to lose. Despite whathe led others [including other Priests] to believe, he did not use his truename when standing forth proudly [or superciliously?] as “Public SatanicPriest Number One”. When it became that monies derived from Churchincome were insufficient, he decided to start his own, perhaps morelucrative “church”. Since he informed prospective disciples, i.e. members ofthe Church of Satan, that they could apply whatever fees they had given himfor merchandise, memberships, etc. toward the initiation fee for his newgroup, this new venture appears more pragmatic than idealistic. TheChurch of Satan has never imposed costs other than those clearly stated.[The only possible exception is the Church-approved practice of certainGrotto Leaders to request a nominal donation for meetings, by whichmembers help ease the financial burden placed upon the Grotto Leader bythe operation of his Grotto.] Such measures as additional initiation fees [or“Grotto fees”] violate the rules and regulations of the Order. Had we beeninformed that such fees were being collected by Rev. West, such practiceswould have been brought to a swift halt! Clearly Rev. West could not havesolicited any more money without running into real trouble.Simply speaking, Rev. West found his goal unrealized, his pride hurt,his wallet empty, and his face the same color as most of the figures on hisChurch financial “records”. Thus his decision to defect.Mr. West’s principal reason given in his letter of resignation was thatthe High Priest had, in the last issue of the Cloven Hoof, “forbidden”members from reading Crowley et al. We do not accept this sort of- 892 -nonchalant leave-taking lightly. Mr. West is indeed deluded if he expects totake that which we have entrusted to him and reject us so casually.Unbeknownst to him we have an entire dossier on his activities prior to hisjoining the Church of Satan. We have complete knowledge of his true name,age, past occupations, conditions under which he has “traveled”, criminalrecord, sexual preoccupations, and health record. We are also very muchaware of his emotional instability and tendency to throw himself headlonginto given situations, reap any rewards said situations may offer, and thenmake swift, unannounced egress when the going gets rough. If need be, wewill not hesitate to expose him for what he is not!Why did we accept him, knowing these things? We did not know …then. We were willing to accept a man who exhibited an apparentdedication and verve, combined with a personable and articulatedemeanor, at face value until he might prove unworthy. And although thisis not a “halfway house”, we felt it would have been unjust and debilitatingto him were we to confront him with certain facts we eventually discoveredabout his past, unless we received complaints about his personal ethicsfrom members under his ægis.The High Priest’s intensive, lifelong delvings into all facets of humanexperience have provided him with an incisive, expeditious process ofevaluating his fellow man. He is, as one noted sociologist termed him, “oneof the best everyday sociologists I know”. And, as Paul Krassner, editor ofthe Realist, once said in a conversation with Dr. LaVey, “Don’t you get tiredof people coming to you as the Magus and then expecting you not to seetheir ‘little dances’? I bet that’s one of the hardest parts of your job - notletting on that you do see.” Mr. West has made the disastrous blunder ofthinking he could beat the Devil.The Church of Satan is part of a magical curriculum with a very strongfoundation - far stronger than most realize. Only the tip of the iceberg canbe seen and thus analyzed. “Somebody” down here likes us.What is to become of the Dayton/Detroit membership now that“Bishop West” has left his “flock” in the lurch? It will undoubtedly grow andmature even more rapidly than before! Each of you will have greaterfreedom than ever before to contribute your ideas and ideals, your vitalmagical energy towards the true aims and purposes of our Infernal Order,while reaping more bountiful harvests in return for the sustenance andcohesiveness you lend to the movement. In the past the Church of Satanhas flourished both because of and in spite of the Wayne Westsencountered during the last five and a half years, and will continue to do so- 893 -in the future. Mr. West’s residency in our Order has been an interesting,often entertaining, sometimes distressing experience to our membership.Now we must deal with the present rather than the past, for it is once moretime for the Church of Satan to move ahead.Under the capable leadership of your Regional Agents and GrottoLeaders, Messrs. Douglas Robbins and John DeHaven, Church activity willcarry on as usual. Meetings will be held at regularly appointed times, andthe above-mentioned gentlemen will correspond with the Central Grotto onyour behalf as has been customary since the institution of ourRegionalization Program. We do, however, emphatically remind you that inany matter which cannot be handled by your Agent or Grotto Leader, youare welcome to call or write the Central Grotto.Both the Belphegor and Stygian Grotto Leaders have on file materialexplaining the responsibilities and benefits pertaining to the position ofAgent. They will be pleased to show you this information, should you at anytime be unable to determine whether a specific matter requires theattention of Central Grotto. Although it does not state that complaintsconcerning members in positions of authority should be directed here, itshould be obvious that such matters could not conceivably be directed tothose in charge, under circumstances as serious as those which you haverecently encountered. Please do express any minor grievances to yourGrotto Leader, though, for he is always open to your suggestions andworthwhile criticism offered in a courteous, decorous manner. BothDouglas Robbins and John DeHaven have displayed admirable objectivityand sincere concern in matters relative to the successful operation of theirGrottos. They are also to be commended for the dispatch with which theyhandled the current “crisis”. We are therefore grateful to them for theirefficient leadership in their respective areas. At a later date other Grottoswill be needed in Detroit and Dayton, so we are pleased to note thepotential leadership abilities in many of our members in these areas.The matter of recouping funds paid to Mr. West for which nothing wasreceived in return is of prime concern to the Central Grotto, as well as tothose members who have fallen victim to Mr. West’s misappropriation oftheir monies. We suggest that you write to the Central Grotto immediatelyupon receipt of this communiqué and inform us of the exact amount paid tohim [specify whether cash, check, or money order], the item(s) for which itwas paid, the date it was given to him, and whether or not you haveapproached him on the matter. We will at once forward a statement on each- 894 -letter, informing the sender whether the order and remittance werereceived by us and, if so, when they were mailed.In checking our records, however, we find that we have received neitherorders nor monies from Mr. West since the beginning of June of this year.At that time he sent $20 for four II° examinations without indicating forwhom they were being ordered. The only other exceptions were severalapplications received by us on July third which had been held by him fortwo to three months “pending ‘receipt’ of necessary membership fees” forsome of them, and because of his own admitted negligence in notforwarding the others. He advised us not to worry about the delay in ourforwarding of membership materials and merchandise, because he hadinformed the applicants and members that “it usually takes Central Grottoat least three months to process these”. Although the staff of the CentralGrotto is less than adequate in size - owing to the confidential nature ofmost of its work, which requires staff members to be selected with theutmost care - we certainly take less than three months to processapplications and merchandise orders! Memberships are processed withintwo to four weeks, usually, and merchandise orders are handled within theweek following our receipt of them.We would suggest you forward carbon copies of your letters to Mr.Robbins or Mr. DeHaven, so they may match your letters with the copieswe will send them of our replies. This will enable them to determine, assoon as possible, when they have received all the necessary data for theirpresentation of the case at the Small Claims Court in your county. Mr.Robbins has agreed to either handle this matter himself or appoint areasonable person to act as coordinator and accompany those involvedwhen they go to court. We assume Mr. DeHaven will do likewise, though hehas not yet been queried on the matter as he is presently on vacation out ofstate. You may reach him after October third or fourth, however.We have also been informed that certain members gave Mr. Westdeposits on the registration fee for the Eastern Regional Conference. Pleasefollow the procedure suggested above, except forward an additional copy ofyour letters to Rev. Aquino [the Conference was originally his idea, and hehas assumed at least 75% of the organizational responsibilities pertaining toit]. Please address your correspondence to Rev. Michael A. Aquino, c/o theNineveh Grotto.Some members have expressed worriment over personal recordsretained by Mr. West. We assure you that every effort will be made toreclaim these files and return them to their owners. We have written to him- 895 -asking that any materials pertaining to the Church of Satan and itsindividual members be forwarded to the Central Grotto. Should we notreceive prompt delivery of these materials, we will not hesitate to resort tomore drastic measures.Despite the fact that we already have ample reason for retaliation - Mr.West having thrown the first stone, so to speak - we will not “rattle anyskeletons” in his closet unless he forces us to. [We are not in the practiceof turning the other cheek, and if Mr. West deludes himself that anypurportedly “confidential information” fed him during his affiliation withthe Church of Satan will cause us to do so, he is less sophisticated than evenwe credit him as being. One of the fundamental rules of magic is: “Neversay anything you don’t fully expect to have repeated.”] We feel certain Mr.West will see the advisability of forwarding to the Central Grotto allpersonal records on members, since they will serve no useful purpose in hispresent situation. We will keep you informed on this and will return anypersonal materials to the proper parties as soon as we receive them.Certain claims by Mr. West are so ludicrous that their very naturewould obviate an explanation or denial from us were it not for thepuzzlement expressed by a few members. So briefly:(a) No, Mr. West did not write, research, type, proofread, or in any wayassist the High Priest in writing the Satanic Bible. The Bible was already inprint when we received Mr. West’s initial letter of inquiry.(b) Neither Rev. Aquino nor Rev. Frazier are “with” Mr. West in his“break” with the Church, nor do they agree with what he claims are hisgrievances with regard to Church policies. Furthermore these two Priests ofMendes, who, according to Mr. West, had agreed to hand in theirresignations also, hadn’t the slightest notion of Mr. West’s intentions,although they were not particularly surprised to learn of his resignation.(c) As mentioned previously, the Eastern Regional Conference was Rev.Aquino’s brainchild and pet project - not Mr. West’s - although apparentlyhe is now taking credit for the whole thing. Mr. West is largely responsiblefor the cancellation of the Conference, however, since Rev. Aquino was ledto believe the Dayton/Detroit membership had lost interest in the event, forhe received none of the registration fees collected by Rev. West.(d) The Council has issued no edict prohibiting members’ reading ofsuch authors as Levi, Crowley, Ahmed, Ophiel, Bardo, Butler, Hall, or anyother literary works - including the Holy Bible! Apparently what wasintended in the last issue of the Cloven Hoof as a bit of straight-from-the-shoulder magical instruction was misconstrued by a small percentage of the- 896 -membership as an official directive from the High Priest. Regardless of thereasons for this, certainly Rev. West, whose Priestly duties includedclarification of such misunderstandings, should have taken the time toreread the High Priest’s article in order to determine the cause of theconfusion. Had he done so, he would have been able to assuage anyresentment over what was regarded by certain members as an unreasonableprohibition by quoting from the last paragraph: “Summing up, if you needto steep yourselves in occult lore, despite this diatribe, by all means do so…” [Please note the article was admittedly and intentionally a diatribe.]Rev. West evidently skimmed over that part - perhaps because his mindwas on “more important matters” than the responsibilities of his office.Once and for all, you are not only permitted but encouraged to readanything you so desire. It is the responsibility of the Church of Satan,however, to offer magical guidance to its membership. Hence we suggestyou keep an objective, open mind in all matters. The High Priest refuses tobelieve that the membership would prefer occult pabulum to Infernalwisdom; thus his straightforward instruction in matters magical. The manyfavorable comments we have received on the last two issues of the C.H.seem to bear out his conviction that the membership of the Church ofSatan, unlike members of other occult-based groups, is prepared to acceptmagical instruction which is uncluttered by heavy-handed esotericism.(e) Rev. West had apparently told conflicting stories [neither of whichis true] anent the Editorship of the Cloven Hoof. One was that he was theEditor - or at least “did most of the work”, and the other was that the HighPriest and Priestess were the Editors. The fact of the matter is that whileDr. LaVey certainly has set certain editorial standards for the Church’sofficial publication, neither he nor Lady Diane maintain the predictable,month-to-month schedule which would enable them to assume such atime-consuming task as editing a monthly newsletter - even if they wantedto! As for Mr. West’s alleged Editorship, basing your conclusion on yourpast observations of his personality, does it seem logical that he would havedone so without due recognition? Surely his name would have beenemblazoned across the masthead in oversized typeface at the very least!(f) Mr. West has alluded to knowledge of the identities of the Council ofNine when in reality he has no such knowledge other than what he found itconvenient to assume.(g) The High Priest has no intention of “getting out now that he’s madehis dollar on the Church of Satan”, as those in attendance at the lastmeeting of the Babylon Grotto were led to believe. It is highly ironical that- 897 -Mr. West should make such a statement, since we had received notificationthat we had cleared the major hurdle towards obtaining even greaterlegitimacy for the Church only days before he made his fallaciousstatement. 824 Since he had been informed of this prior to announcing hisresignation, it was perhaps instrumental in his decision to take his leavewhen he did. Knowing that once we announced the Church’s recent victory,his opportunity to gain disciples for his own “church” would beconsiderably impaired, it was expedient to “make his move” while he couldstill tell prospective recruits that the Church of Satan was slated fordefunction.We have undoubtedly neglected to comment on other, relatively minordiscrepancies in Rev. West’s “farewell speech” but trust you will understandthat it would be impossible to offer rebuttal on every point. As of thisbulletin, the Church of Satan considers “Reverend Wayne Forrest West” adead issue.Summing up, in the words of Dr. LaVey: “We have a great task ahead ofus, and other Priests will come and go according to the mettle of theirbeing. If we were to allow incidents such as this to deter us, we wouldplease our foes immensely. Internal schisms in any organization lead tofragmentation and thence to dissolution. The reason witchcraft groups lackcohesive power is that they are too busy cursing each other and workingovertime trying to disparage the Church of Satan. It becomes increasinglyapparent that the most understated member of the Church of Satanentertains far more magical strength and stock in the future than a ‘highpriest’ or ‘priestess’ of a kindergarten-level coven. Our unity will ensure ourendurance. Let others start their copycat groups and try to maintain theirprovincial sects. We will bury them.”824 Anton and Diane are referring to the formalization of the Church as aCaliforniacorporation on September 20, 1971.- 898 -- 899 -Appendix 30: “Satan Rift Centers in Detroit -Grotto Becomes ‘Occultic’ Church”- by Hiley H. Ward, Religion WriterDetroit Free Press, March 25, 1972Division and strife marked with name-calling have erupted in theChurch of Satan. The movement which sought to purge man of his guilthang-ups and free him from the infighting and prejudices of mainlinereligion now has its own cauldron of bad feeling to exorcise. At the center ofthe “cloven hoof and dagger” type of controversy going on in secret is anenigmatic Huntington Woods man with a British accent, Wayne ForrestWest, as he calls himself. West, whose expired Michigan state driver’slicense says his age is 54, has “dissolved” the Babylon Grotto, of which hehas been master for the Church of Satan. West has taken about 10, possiblymore of the Babylon Grotto members with him to form a new First OcculticChurch of Man in his apartment at 1002 South Woodward, HuntingtonWoods. Gone are the orange-red ritual chambers with goat head symbolsand the ritual table which on occasion was a throne for a near-nude girl.The dissolution brought a ringing condemnation from chief Satanist,High Priest, and Magus of the Black Order Anton Szandor LaVey, head ofthe mother Grotto in San Francisco. In an issue of LaVey’s Cloven Hoofnewsletter to members of the Church of Satan, an article attributed toLaVey declares concerning West: “Unbeknownst to him we have an entiredossier on his activities prior to his joining the Church of Satan. We havecomplete knowledge of his true name, age, past occupation, conditionunder which he has ‘traveled’, criminal record, sexual preoccupation, andhealth record” and “emotional instability”.West, who declines to give any tangible information about hisbackground, drives a car which is leased to the Donbe Beauty Academy runby Mrs. Betty Nemer, of Birmingham, at 31710 Mound, Warren. Westinsists that his followers know his name is “West”; one says he has Britishseaman papers (equivalent to a passport) with the name “Wayne West”. Hehas said he has spent three years preparing for the priesthood with theOblates of Mary Immaculate, but the order reports no record of him inNorth America. To LaVey’s charges, West says the criminal reference isonly a traffic arrest.The bald, wide-grinning Anton LaVey, who wears a Fu-Manchumustache, once was a circus organist and former police photographer. Hewas reported in Europe and unavailable for comment. Doug Robbins, a- 900 -retail salesman, head of the Belphegor Grotto, in a near downtown officebuilding, the only other Grotto in the Detroit area, contacted Mrs. AntonLaVey for the Free Press. She regarded the split as a “dead issue”, Robbinssaid. “The memo [concerning West] was intended for members only, andthere is no necessity for proving anything to anybody,” he quoted Mrs.LaVey as saying.West was strong in his criticism of LaVey in a recent evening meetingof his new Occultic Church in his apartment. West rapped LaVey forassuming the powers of a real Satan or God. [Robbins denies that LaVey isgoing beyond any concept than Satan as just a tool or idea to help manrelieve his guilt hang-ups.] West criticized LaVey’s rituals in San Francisco.“In one of his piddly little rituals, he (LaVey) would scream at a chair,welcoming it to his lair. 825 It was all I could do to keep from laughing. ”West also charged that most of LaVey’s Satanic Bible is swiped from anumber of occult books, among them The Confessions of Aleister Crowley,whom West says LaVey has banned his followers from reading. 826 The nudealtar idea, West says, is swiped from H.P. Lovecraft’s science fictionwritings. 827 “And his rites are almost the Catholic high mass, ” says West.“He’s gotten to be almost semi-Christian,” said a 23-year-old waitress,of LaVey. Now with West’s group, she says she was one of West’s “altars” onseveral occasions. “Altar”, in Satanic church lingo, is another name for thenear-nude girl on the ritual chamber altar. Wayne had a draped table.LaVey’s setting for the altar is a raised fireplace. Satanic members now withWest include David Weinstein828 , 21, an Oakland Community college825 Probably “The Madness of Andelsprutz” (Appendix #4).826 Not true. The first printing of the Satanic Bible took place in December1969, onemonth prior to the first printing of Crowley’s Confessions.827 Also not true. Women played almost no part at all in the stories of the shyH.P.Lovecraft, let alone “lewd” roles as Satanic altars. Cf. The Dunwich Horror (thestory,not the film!) and The Lurker at the Threshold for examples of typical HPLfemalecharacters.828 Author of the letter (note #1) in Chapter #6.- 901 -student, and Seth Kliphoth829 , 20, a former Presbyterian, a taxi driver inLivonia and editor of West’s new First Occultic Church of Man Visionnewsletter.829 Kliphoth secretly retained his Church of Satan membership under his realname ofJohn T. Amend. He later adopted the pseudonym “Seth Typhon” and formed his own“Order of the Black Ram”. When John Ferro wrote to him [Chapter #32], neitherFerronor I were aware of “Typhon’s” Church of Satan membership or defection withWayneWest under other names.- 902 -- 903 -Appendix 31: “For the Dead Travel Fast:All Hallows VI”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #III-11, November VI/1971Although generally considered of secondary import to our high holidayof Walpurgisnacht, Halloween enjoys due prestige within the Church ofSatan. Like most contemporary holidays, its origins are obscure to manypeople, and even the most enthusiastic occultists are frequently found to beconfused by the many “histories” they hear of this event.For instance, you may be surprised to see this article in the NovemberHoof instead of the October one. No, we aren’t guilty of tardiness;November first is All Hallows Day, and “Halloween” does not properlycommence until 12:01 A.M. that morning.Ask a Wiccan for the origin of Halloween, and he will assure you that itconstitutes one of the ancient Druidic fire festivals - Samhein or La Samon(the Feast of the Sun). On the eve of this day all fires save those of theDruids had to be extinguished and then relit from one of the “holy” fireskept by the priesthood. Many Wiccan groups continue to observe thiscustom, although usually it is strongly laced with esoteric gibberish andpseudo-Dianic/Horned God nonsense. Actually the old British observanceprobably provided the Druids with a convenient opportunity to collect somerevenue in return for the newly-kindled fire.“Halloween” predates Druidic England, however. The ancient Romansset aside a special day to honor their dead, and this Feralia occurred onwhat is now February 21st. For no particular reason whatsoever theCatholic Church altered the date to November 1st when it incorporated theRoman festival into the Christian mythos. Festivals, fasts and holidayscorresponding to Halloween can be found in most ancient cultures,including many that were flourishing before the Druids first climbed downfrom the trees.The connection of Satan with All Hallows Eve may also be traced toRoman times, when sacrifices were rendered to Pluto and Proserpine, theking and queen of Hades, in honor of the departed spirits in their charge.Needless to say, the Romans had nothing to do with such idiotic ideas asthe oscularum infame; we have the neurotic imagination of the medievalChristians to thank for such extraordinary notions. The classical “witches’sabbat”, with its cannibalism, soul-selling, sexual brutality, and ritual- 904 -slaughter is completely without substance … with all due disrespect to M.Summers and his devotees.Thus it is that many novices in the Church of Satan express surpriseand even indignation when they learn that we regard the traditional idea ofHalloween with something akin to amusement. We have in fact a seriousrespect for the origins and symbolisms of All Hallows, but we are not aboutto prostitute the festival according to the dementia of popular occultism.On the other hand we shall not denounce Halloween as it stands,proclaiming February 21st to be the “true” All Hallows. The Church of Satanis dedicated not to the revival of dead customs, but to the incorporation ofvalid principles and traditions into present and future practices.Accordingly we observe the evening hours of October 31st as Halloween inour public and familial relations, leaving individual members to decide forthemselves whether to observe the antiquated dates and festivals. For ourpart we are satisfied to distinguish fact from fiction.Modern Halloween, in most people’s minds, means paper decorationsof the “gentle” macabre, jack-o-lanterns, and costumed children rompingthrough the neighborhood in quest of treats upon the dire threat of tricks. Ifyou would like our opinion on the best way to celebrate Halloween, it is topreserve and assist this pleasant and exciting tradition for the youngsters.It is one of the most Satanic experiences to which they will ever be exposed,when the restrictive laws of everyday childhood are discarded for amerciless rampage against the fuddy-duddy adults [Editor’s note: Look inthe mirror sometime!]. It is a time of pleasure for children and adults alike,for in the horrific visages of one’s nocturnal visitors can be glimpsed thoseshining fantasies that are so rarely experienced by the elder citizenry.While we’re on the subject, however, we’re going to speak our mind onone Halloween parasite of which we thoroughly disapprove. The UnitedNations’ Childrens’ Fund (UNICEF), constantly on the search for devices toincrease its revenue, has decided that yesterday’s gluttonous ghosts andgoblins may be coaxed into becoming today’s door-to-door beggars who, inthe best tradition of Oliver Twist, retain nothing of the sums they manageto wheedle. Sanctimonious parents, intoxicated with a sense of benignrighteousness, relieve their tired children of the fruit of the evening’seffortsand forward a check to UNICEF the next morning. The child receives a paton the head, and perhaps a word of impersonal encouragement on behalf of“starving children in India” or whatever. And that is his Halloween!While UNICEF is a very worthwhile organization and has spent muchtime and effort alleviating the suffering of underprivileged families around- 905 -the world, we at the Cloven Hoof take issue with its prostitution ofHalloween as a commercial fund-raising technique. Halloween is a time ofgluttony and orgiastic repast [albeit at the expense of epidemicindigestion], and a fistful of dollar bills is a poor substitute in a child’seyefor even a single dollar’s worth of brightly-colored candy. And as for thoseparents whose indignation is sparked by our contention that they shouldnot reduce their children to panhandlers, let them pad their own egos byfollowing one door behind their offspring with a UNICEF money can. Thusthe children may once more enjoy their cherished holiday, and Mom orDad, if so inclined, can beg for charity.- 906 -- 907 -Appendix 32: “About That Goat”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #III-11, November VI/1971Since we receive about as many inquiries on the Sigil of Baphomet aswe do on everything else combined, we think it’s about time to discuss theorigin and history of our emblem. We have encountered descriptions andopinions ranging from Eliphas Levi’s celebrated drawing [you know - thegoat with the flagpole phallus] to something you put in the tub to keep yourfeet from slipping on the porcelain. So let’s talk about the Baphomet.As is the case with many other symbolisms connected with the Churchof Satan, one cannot claim a definite origin for the Baphomet. Certainly theterm proper came into use with the Order of the Temple (Knights Templar),but goats, rams, and non-human personalities with horned heads havebeen around since the year zero. Horns just seem to hold an attraction formankind, phallic or otherwise. [Wings are in second place; then come sharpteeth, tails, pointed ears, red eyes, talons, and tentacles. Halos, curiouslyenough, were never much in vogue.]The goat is, of course, a virility symbol. If you’ve ever been aroundgoats in the mating season, you’ll know how this tradition got started. Theygo, as it were, quite mad. One accordingly wonders whether the KnightsTemplar were the medieval equivalent of today’s Playboy Club, but historyseems to insist that they sublimated their sex drives into good, cleanwarfare. To each his own.In any case the Templars worshipped a “monstrous head” or a “goatdemon” called [a] Baphomet. Accounts concerning the actual appearance ofthis figure differ markedly, even from the Templars themselves. Thus, whendeciding to adopt this emblem as the seal of the Church of Satan, theCouncil of Nine requested one of our more prominent artists, Mr. HugoZorilla, to design a Baphomet incorporating both the symbolisms ofmodern Satanism and the ancient devices of the Order of the Trapezoid. 830The word “Baphomet” is a reversed composition of three abbreviations:Tem. Oph. Ab., standing for the Latin Templi omnium hominum pacisabhas “[The Father or God of] the Temple of Peace Among All Men”. Quite830 Not true. (a) There was no Council of Nine to make such a request. (b) “HugoZorilla”is an artistic pseudonym of Anton LaVey. (c) The “official Church of SatanBaphomet”appearing on the Satanic Bible and on other C/S documents is an exact copy of apreviously-drawn emblem [see Chapter #37]. (d) The Order of the Trapezoid wasoriginated by Anton LaVey ca. 1966.- 908 -a far cry from the Catholic Inquisition’s ponderous explanation of“Baffomet” as a mere corruption of the name of Mohammed, isn’t it? Butthen the Inquisitors had to pin something on the Templars, and anti-Islamwas all the rage at the time. 831The basic description of the Church of Satan’s Baphomet may be foundin the Satanic Bible, so we will not repeat it here. But you may be interestedto know, particularly if you aspire to the Priesthood of Mendes, that thereare other reasons besides those stated why the pentagram is inverted, whythe goat’s head is incorporated, and why the seal identifies Leviathan andnot Satan per se. But for the present time we shall not discuss this further.The Cloven Hoof’s permanent masthead, also drawn by Mr. Zorilla, hasits own unique history. In the words of the artist: [Here followed the extractof Anton LaVey’s letter quoted in Chapter #15, less the color-schemediscussion.]What is the Baphomet’s role in the Satanic ritual chamber? It isdefinitely not a “god” to be worshipped, adored, or prayed to. It servesrather as a focal device for the concentration of all ritual participants, as anaid to the alignment of attitude and behavior. It may be used eitherdemonstrably or covertly for hypnotic purposes, or as a medium to reflectthe impact of the ceremony either back into the chamber or away from it.Thus the Baphomet need not remain in a static environment.Depending upon the circumstances of the moment, it may be illuminatedwith colored or ultraviolet light, relocated within the chamber, enlarged ordecreased in size, endowed with audio frequency effects, or even removed831 This was as much as I had uncovered by VI/1971. That tortured backwardsword-juggling was Eliphas Levi’s, and it’s anyone’s guess where he dug it up! Themostsensible explanation for “Baphomet” to date is that of Idries Shah, who, in hisbook TheSufis, suggests that the term was probably a corruption of the Arabic abufihamat(pronounced “bufihimat”), which means “father” or “source of understanding”.JosephDaniels II° of Indianapolis was the first to suggest [after reading this ClovenHoofarticle] that the Templar/Arabic term might have been a corruption of theancientEgyptian Ba-neb-Tettu, the hieroglyphic term for the city of Mendes in the NileDelta. InPtolemaic accounts Mendes was “notorious” for its goat-god, who was said to matewithwomen in religious festivals. The truth is probably less lurid. Comments SirE.A. WallisBudge in his Gods of the Egyptians: “The title Ba-neb-Tettu was sometimes heldtomean the ‘Soul, the Lord Tettu’, and this was the name at Mendes of the localform ofKhnemu, whose symbol there, as elsewhere, was a ram … He was regarded as thevirileprinciple in gods and men, and is styled ‘King of the South and North, the ram,the virilemale, the holy phallus which stirreth up the passions of love …’”- 909 -entirely! It should never become an “accepted” and consequently irrelevantbackdrop to the proceedings.Remember that the Baphomet is reflective and not generative [as a truegod-idol is supposed to be]. The Satanist is not a weak being who mustdraw his energies from other sources; he summons the innate forces of hisown Will to accomplish his ends. This is just as true in the ritual chamber asin day-to-day life.Summarily the Baphomet as designed and employed by the Church ofSatan is not symbolic of a return to medieval, ancient, or prehistoricsuperstition. We are “experimentalists” and not ignorant savages. It wouldbe ridiculous, wouldn’t it, to reject theist tradition and then cling to aSatanism as it is dictated and defined by the proponents of God-worship?This, incidentally, is why our blood pressure rises considerably whenpompous, occult “authorities” smugly accuse the Church of Satan of being“inauthentic” in doctrine. If you must go by Catholic or Jewish premises,then yes, we are inauthentic. But part of the idea behind the Church ofSatan is the reconsideration of premises as well as of opinions based uponthose premises.- 910 -- 911 -Appendix 33: “The Jesus People are Still Revolting”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #III-11, November VI/1971At press time the Jesus Revolution was still in progress, though we’refrankly somewhat disappointed that it hasn’t gathered more impetus. As amatter of fact, it seems to be fizzling out rather ingloriously. Yes, JesusChrist Superstar has just enjoyed a smash opening on Broadway, but thereis so much grassroots confusion and bitterness concerning the personalityand doctrines of J. Christ that any sort of cohesive movement seemssomething of a pipe dream. The Jesus of Superstar is a man, not a god, andhe is portrayed as an underdog and a radical altruist, not as the awe-inspiring Son of God that his menagerie of churches proclaim him to be.The Broadway version of the famous recorded opera has, from ourpoint of view, some very intriguing aspects. The character of Judas becomesa mainstay of rationality within a whirlpool of more or less pettyantagonisms. At one point Judas, disillusioned by Jesus Christ’s growingmegalomania, threatens to not betray him - and thereby thwart his schemeto immortalize himself through legend. King Herod is rather amusinglycharacterized as a drag queen, the Jewish priests as don’t-rock-the-boatbureaucrats, and the disciples as social climbers seeking to further theirown reputations through association with Jesus.It is not surprising that, when the play opened in Manhattan, it wasbesieged by hoards of pickets and protesters. The American JewishCommittee, incensed by the characterization of the priests, condemnedSuperstar as a severe blow to Jewish/Christian relations. Nor does thecomedy rest with the behavior of onlookers; the producers of the rock operahave already prosecuted 15 court actions [amounting to over $125,000 inlawyers’ fees] in defense of their product. Local churches, student groups,and even a convent of nuns in Sydney, Australia were forced to cease theirown productions. Now offered in many stores are Jesus Christwristwatches, T-shirts, and buttons; and a growing number of head shopsare carrying, so help us, official Jesus bikinis and jockey shorts. This may beone time when the Church of Satan’s disposition to blasphemy has beencompletely upstaged.But what of the Jesus Revolution itself? The questing generation,searching for a theme to replace first the psychedelic era and then theoccultist period, jumped into neo-Christianity with a splash that Moses atthe Red Sea would have envied. Unfortunately the leadership has been bred- 912 -to “revolutionary” theories and mass-actions - hardly the forte ofinstitutional Christianity!It was interesting to follow the progress of the Jesus people as theyencountered the realities of their supposed heroes. When Billy Grahamcame to Oakland, California, masses of teenagers and young adults flockedto the arena in which he spoke - expecting, no doubt, to witness somethingof the “magic” of Christ in his message. What they got instead [as we couldhave told them, had they thought to ask] was an absolutely nauseatingseries of testimonials and personal revelations from a succession of earnest-visaged evangelists right up to and including the Graham Quacker of themall.When he received catcalls and taunts from the bored audience, hefervently denounced such protests as the product of immaturity. Hisaudiences since then have become less and less frequented by the vanguardof the youth movements, although many of the latecomers still attend inhopes of gleaning some revolutionary dynamic. Fat chance!Here at CHHQ we have met more than our share of Jesus Freaks.There is a huge Baptist seminary across town, for one thing, and all youhave to do is wave a Baphomet and thirty or forty illuminati will commenceto save your soul by talking you to death. You can always identify them bythat blank look of nonsensical rapture on their faces. If given free rein, theywill try to remold your own face into a similar grimace, or even to coax youinto a swimming pool, lake, or river for a purificatory immersion. “OneWay!” is their cry - a suggestion that man can achieve happiness onlythrough total submission to Christ, whatever that is.Perhaps the most valuable piece of information provided by the entirefad stems from the eagerness with which existing Christian churches andreligious societies jumped at the chance to attract the young. The moreliberal protestant sects were quick to sponsor encounter-type servicesaccentuated by acid-rock, and even the staid Vatican found it hard not toyield to the temptation of full pews.“Has the Catholic Church Lost its Soul?” screams the cover of a recentNewsweek. Well, it isn’t doing too hot in the cadre department. Accordingto Jesuit sociologists, particularly Eugene Schallert of the University of SanFrancisco, the church is currently losing about five priests for every twothat it ordains. Frustrated by the restrictions of dogma and tantalized to agreat degree by the demonstrated willingness of the young to contemplateChrist in a reasonable frame of reference, many of the church’s most- 913 -powerful thinkers and activists are exchanging their collars for freedom ofexpression and action.A few issues ago we predicted that the Jesus Revolution wouldultimately assist the cause of Satanism by tempting the establishedreligions to debase their dignity [and its inherent mystery] before thefrivolities of the young. 832 On one count we were wrong; we thought that itmight take several years.Also of interest is that man’s strong desire for ritualistic philosophy isevidencing itself through patterns estranged from the institutionalchurches. Religion is now the fastest growing graduate field at the nation’ssecular universities, with over 300 doctorates granted this past schoolyear. The programs involved are increasingly those with a comparativetheologies emphasis; students must gain a mastery of all the world’s majorbeliefs - not just Christianity. Well, how’s your Shinto?Let’s try to draw a conclusion or two, as well as to make a broadestimate of things to come in the religious profile of the country over thenext several years. First of all the Jesus Revolution, though short-lived, hasset in motion an accelerated trend from institutional theology toobjective theology. The restrictive element of dogma, in other words, isbeing rejected as too great a hindrance upon the inquisitiveness of thehuman mind. People are literally “thinking faster” today than in centuriespast; concepts that used to require years of laborious study to beappreciated are now snatched at, chewed, and digested by students in thepassage of a month or two.Thus we can look forward to a temporary migration from the moreconservative churches to the more experimental ones (the Unitarians, forexample). The Christian mythos has so permeated the American culture,however, that it will continue to dominate the norm for the foreseeablefuture. Its popular appeal, which is based upon faith as opposed torationality [or Christ, if you will, as opposed to Judas], is far greater thanthat of Satanism. Thinking is a difficult business for many individuals; thusthe Church of Satan will probably continue to appeal to a specific interestgroup and not to a general cross-section of the national or globalpopulation.There is a very important point to be taken from this, and it is thatestimates of our development which are based upon numerical growth aremisleading. More to the point is whether the existing membership is able to832 M.A. Aquino, “Backlash”, Cloven Hoof #III-7, July VI/1971.- 914 -grasp and apply the principles of Diabolism in both theory and practice. Defacto elitism demands nothing less.- 915 -Appendix 34: “Hell on Reels”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #III-11, November VI/1971 and #III-12, December VI,1971For the last year we had been waiting to see The Mephisto Waltz,reputedly the most highly budgeted and distinctively cast film on Satanismsince Rosemary’s Baby. The script was supposedly a direct adaptation fromthe book, and even Time gave the picture an enthusiastic review. But wedidn’t get to see it until last month; the Cloven Hoof is apparently on thetail end of the first-run circuit.Well, it was a bomb, a cop-out, a flaming bore. A group of jet-setters[and a jet retriever] running around smearing each other with blue oil,thereby exchanging identities/bodies. There were no good ritual scenes.[Even Werewolves on Wheels had a decent ritual scene!] No demonicmanifestations either - just a nude girl nervously chalking magic circles onthe floor. That’s the picture you’ll see on the poster, and it’s the high pointof the show. Save your money.The VI film season is salvaged very well indeed by The Brotherhood ofSatan, which is an exact video version of the book. Shot in wide-screencolor, it bears the marks of excellent acting and meticulous attention tolayout and special effects. It also bears a \"PG\" rating. This is rather amusingbecause, while sexual activity is minimal, the film is far more gory thaneven House of Dark Shadows. Within three minutes after the picture hasstarted, an entire family in a station wagon is squashed flat by a tank. Thedecapitated head of a too-nosy Christian rolls merrily against the leg of theyoung Catholic priest, and the heroine seems to spend most of her timewandering through the charnel-house wherein the victims of the Satanistsare stashed. Bodies sprawl every which-way, and plastic bags of arms andlegs dangle from the ceiling.We were somewhat surprised to see Strother Martin cast as the SatanicPriest, since he is most famous for playing drunks in westerns. Indeed hiscover identity in Brotherhood is that of a lushy, small-town physician. Butit only serves to make his transformation all the more striking, as he playshis arcane role to perfection. The final scenes of the film - and the ultimatetwist to the story - are jewels worthy of Hitchcock. A motion picture wellworth your time to see, but don’t bother to eat dinner beforehand.Take an evening off from singing Christmas carols, and go see TheDevils, a WB7 flick currently making the rounds. Ostensibly it is the saga of- 916 -the nuns of Loudun in 17th century France. Upon a threat or two fromCardinal Richelieu’s henchmen, they feigned demonic possession andblamed it all upon one Father Urbain Grandier, who seems to have been avery Satanic playboy-priest indeed. He was summarily tortured, convicted,and burnt at the stake.Oliver Reed plays Grandier in the movie, and the mother superior,Sister Jeanne des Anges, is portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave. Both aremagnificent. The only apparent goofs are a smallpox vaccination on the armof Grandier’s mistress and the acid-rock-singer visage of the priest who\"questions\" Grandier.The plot may be a little ponderous, but the forte of the picture is itstreatment of color, sets, and visual shock techniques. At that time in historythe Catholics and the protestants were slugging it out, and severalmutilated corpses of the latter are shown in gory detail. The plague gotmost of the rest; one of the scenes shows Grandier swinging his censeridiotically over a mass-grave of plague victims. The sets are sublimesurrealism - far more so than Marat-Sade. The Catholic church dislikes thisfilm even more so than it did Rosemary’s Baby, and you’ll know why whenyou see it. Even though the film is intentionally a satire, you’ll feel verysorry for the people who had to endure those times.As a Christmas gesture of good will, take your local Christian clergyalong as guests. We’re certain it will leave quite an impression on them.- 917 -Appendix 35: “Legacy of the Four-Sided Triangle”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #III-12, December VI/1971Pyramids have become so notorious in occult circles that we hesitate toreintroduce the subject. Practically every secret society in history hasincorporated the Egyptian pyramids into the mythology of the moment.The monuments are just too fascinating in their enigmatic simplicity toignore. Even Will Cuppy, author of the famous historical satire The Declineand Fall of Practically Everybody, could not resist explaining why theyhave remained standing so long: “because it is not in the nature of apyramid to tip over”.Of course there are pyramids and pyramids. The Central and SouthAmerican Indian civilizations built them. The ancient Britons contributedpyramid-shaped mounds. And the early cultures in Asias Minor & Majorproduced both “true” pyramids and countless architectural variations onthe pyramid theme. But the scholar of pyramids - “pyramidiot”, if youprefer - need look no further than the famous group at Giza to concludethat there is something very compulsive and uncanny about the structures.Consider in particular the Great Pyramid - according to mostarchaeological texts the tomb of the Pharaoh Cheops. If you’ve digested afair sampling of occult literature, you’ve heard that the poor old pile wasreally (a) a fake tomb for Cheops, (b) someone else’s tomb, (c) an initiationtemple, (d) a symbol of God, (e) a chronicle of the Christian scriptures, (f) amonument to Osiris and Isis, and/or (g) a Terrible Tabernacle of HumanSacrifice, Nameless Rites, and Unspeakable Orgies. The Rosicrucians(AMORC) solemnly proclaim the Pyramid to be “the cosmic mound, amanifestation of the fourfold nature of light, and of evolution … a mostsacred structure, where communion with God became possible”. And theless said about the Theosophists, the Cabalists, and the Scientologists thebetter.The Cloven Hoof would like to try to clear up at least a little of thishideous mess. In doing so we wish to express our sincere appreciation toMr. Peter Tompkins, whose book Secrets of the Great Pyramid sheds thelight of scientific sanity upon what was previously a debacle of crazedfoolishness.From the time of its construction the Pyramid remained inviolate until820 C.E., when Abdullah Al Mamun, the Caliph of Baghdad, determined toexplore it in the hopes of uncovering a funeral treasure cache. Rumors of- 918 -the descending passage had survived from Roman times, and Al Mamunwas able to locate it by means of a forced tunnel. By chance he discoveredthe ascending passage, of which no previous explorer had ever spoken. Itwas blocked by three granite plugs, each weighing several tons, and anumber of limestone blocks. It was obvious that there had never been aprevious violation of the ascending passage, since the solid rock wasundisturbed.Upon tunneling past the plugs, Al Mamun’s men discovered the GrandGallery and the so-called King’s and Queen’s Chambers. They contained nodecorations or objects at all, save for a large, granite coffer in the King’sChamber. It is popularly referred to as the sarcophagus of Khufu or Cheops,the second Pharaoh of the IV Dynasty (ca. 2600 BCE) for two reasons: (1) Itis roughly the size of a sarcophagus. (2) Khufu’s cartouche was later foundto be roughly inscribed on one of the stones above the ceiling of the King’sChamber.Such “evidence” is so flimsy that no serious scholar can accept it asconclusive. A crude quarry-mark is hardly grounds for the identification ofthe entire structure, and the coffer is bare of funerary markings. And ofcourse there was no corpse to be found.The Great Pyramid was subsequently ignored until 1798, whenNapoleon’s forces invaded Egypt. The French general was intrigued by themonument, and his engineers made two important discoveries: (1) Thesides were exactly oriented to the cardinal points of the compass - as itturned out, more accurately so than any other human construction until thepresent century. (2) The Pyramid was located precisely at the apex of an arcenclosing the entire Nile delta. Such geodetic calculation is quitesophisticated, particularly since aerial surveying would be necessary formodern duplication of the feat.In 1854 John Taylor, a British astronomer and mathematician, foundthe slope of the Pyramid’s sides to be 51°51’. He also made a discovery thatshould have discredited the reputed Greek origin of higher geometry: Theperimeter of the Pyramid divided by twice its height yields 3.14159, anextremely accurate value for pi.This in turn led to an even more interesting mathematical discovery.The Egyptian priests had mentioned to Herodotus that the area of each facewas equal to the square of the Pyramid’s height, and calculations derivedfrom this yield the value of phi, architecture’s famous “Golden Section”. It isphi that permits the projection of a triangular surface onto a spherical- 919 -quadrant; thus the Egyptians possessed the capability to achieve mapprojections of high accuracy.[Neither pi nor phi are generally supposed to have been formulateduntil Classical Greek times. Phi in particular was one of the most protected[the death penalty] of the secrets of the Pythagorean fraternity.]Additional architectural calculations were undertaken in 1865 byProfessor C. Piazzi Smyth of Scotland, and subsequently by scores of otherPyramidologists. The linear precision of the Pyramid was found to beremarkable; the 350’ of the descending passage is true to 1/4”, and theexternal casing stones’ perimeter to 1/100” in 75”. The joints of the casingstones are so finely cut that the average mortared gap between them is only1/50”.The keys to the Egyptian cubits employed in the Pyramid were found inthe King’s Chamber. The ancient Royal Cubit of geographical measurementis defined in the chamber’s dimensions, and that of weight & volume by thecoffer. Recurring constantly in the chamber are the crucial “Pythagorean”triangles 3/4/5 and 2/square root of 5/3 - which also occur in triangularanalysis of the three major pyramids’ positions on the Giza plateau.The coffer, by the way, is cut from a single block of granite. It is so hardthat a modern duplicate would require over two tons’ pressure withdiamond drills in order to hollow it out.Smyth came up with yet another startling correspondence. Afterfinding that the Pyramid rises from its base in the proportion 10/9, hemultiplied the total height by 109 and obtained 91,840,000 equivalentmiles, the approximate radius of Earth’s orbit around the Sun.And a British engineer named Davidson subsequently proved that theperimeter of the Pyramid can be used to calculate the lengths of the solar,sidereal, and anomalistic years. Knowledge of Earth’s solar radius and thelength of the sidereal year permit the computation of, among other things,the rate at which Earth is falling towards the Sun, the specific gravity ofEarth and the Sun, the solar parallax, and the speed of light.The Pyramid, then, appears to be a device for recording importantscientific and mathematical principles, the implications of which wouldhave been extremely disturbing to the average Egyptian. But was this theonly purpose of the Pyramid? Why and how was the ascending passageplugged from the inside? A very interesting hypothesis was advanced atthe turn of the century by an astronomer named Richard A. Proctor:A curious hieroglyph was discovered at the solar temples at Annu(Heliopolis) and Karnak. It is the symbol for a pyramid with the upper part- 920 -missing, i.e. a truncated pyramid. A pole-like device is shown rising fromthe upper surface. Proctor suspected a correspondence to the GreatPyramid, and his investigations yielded the following considerations:(1) If the Pyramid’s construction had been temporarily halted at the topof the Grand Gallery, the Gallery could have been used as a very effectiveastronomical measurement instrument. Over 80% of the sky could havebeen observed, and the declination of all visible stars from -50° below thecelestial equator to +30° above could be recorded.(2) The Pyramid’s accurate directional orientation would have beenpossible through the sighting of the star Alpha Draconis down thedescending passage at the moment of the Autumn Equinox (Halloween toyou latter-day traditionalists).(3) The flat surface of the truncated Pyramid would have served tomark and record stellar and planetary azimuths. Hour angles and the rightascension of the bodies could be obtained, leading to star maps and thedevelopment of longitude and latitude on maps of our own planet.(4) After all such calculations had been completed [a few years wouldsuffice], the observatory could have been sealed from the “inside”, theKing’s Chamber and coffer constructed as permanent records for thedistant future, and the Pyramid topped off to serve as a furthermathematical record through its altitude correspondences.We could easily fill another ten issues of the Hoof with additional itemsof Pyramidology, but in the interests of brevity we shall commend ourreaders who are Pyramanaics to Mr. Tompkins’ admirable book. We shallconclude with one or two tangent observations:The designers of the Great Pyramid and [at minimum] the Gizacomplex possessed a knowledge of mathematical and physical science thatwas not to be reapproached until the seventeenth century - and then only inpart. It is obvious that either the Egyptian civilization was far older andmore advanced than we generally suspect it to be, or that scientificknowledge alien to the Nile culture was introduced.The former option is the less probable of the two, as we possessarchæological evidence of the early Egyptian dynasties and of the illiteratesocial groupings that predate the Upper and Lower Egyptian unification. 833833 Cf. Michael A. Hoffman, Egypt Before the Pharaohs, New York: Alfred A.Knopf,1979.- 921 -In the legends of the Khemite gods the Order of the Trapezoid hasuncovered some most curious data which may bear upon the problem. 834Perhaps we may pursue the matter in a future issue, conditions permitting.For the moment we shall merely borrow the ancient Greek word for“teacher” - daimon - and refer to the mysterious architects of man’s earliestscientific achievements as … teachers.834 The Order of the Trapezoid, in this case, was myself, who first broachedthese data ina letter to Anton LaVey in December 1971 [see Chapter #16]. My eventual Hoofarticleon the matter was entitled “The Source” (Appendix #67).- 922 -- 923 -Appendix 36: “Season’s Greetings”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #III-12, December VI/1971835December is the month for Christmas, one of the world’s most popularholidays. It is a time of festivals and fellowship, and the quasi-Christianbackground of the occasion is no reason for the Satanist to deny himself theenjoyment of the season. For, like most other Christian holidays,“Christmas” is a plagiarism from a defeated rival - Mithraism.Mithraism - or the Mithraic Mysteries - first appeared in Persia about500 years before the birth of Christ. Based upon the worship of Mithra, asun-god who had pledged to bring peace and plenty to the Earth, thereligion took many of its mythological symbolisms from the old Chaldeanastrology. Among these were the weekdays’ planetary names, a remnant ofwhich we have today as Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. The originalconcept of the “Christian” Hell, the Dæmonic Powers, and the Apocalypseare also Mithraic; they are not a part of pre-Christian Judaism.Mithraism spread quickly throughout the known world, subsiding onlyafter centuries of persecution by established Christianity. As a religionespecially popular among the Roman military [Mithra was often known asthe “soldier’s god”], Mithraism became familiar from Scotland to theSahara. Ceremonies and rituals were held at night in “Mithræums” -temples located in caverns or in dark, wooded grottos [and thus the tribute835 I had asked the LaVeys for their opinions concerning Christmas whilepreparing thisarticle, but I didn’t receive their answer in time to incorporate it. OnDecember 5, VI/1971 Diane LaVey wrote to me: “We’ve always pretty much left it up to themembers todo as they wish, but you’re right in thinking we should at least offer someguidelines.Our immediate family celebrates Solstice (December 22-23), and the Santa Clausproblem is nonexistent here because Zeena hasn’t believed in him since she wasfour.I’ve broached the subject of a ‘Father Frost’ [or whatever] type character forthe kiddiesduring discussions with Anton on this, but we’ve never come to any realconclusions. Ican’t decide if it would be selling out - replacing Santa with another fairyfellow (W.W.,maybe?) - or if we’d be reclaiming our rightful ownership to certain wintertidelegends ifwe set up a Satanic festival for the Earth’s barren period. It seems somethingis needed,but we can’t decide just what. Perhaps the December Hoof will set the wheels inmotion.”- 924 -to Mithraism by the Church of Satan in the naming of its own localgroups]. 836It is possible that such extreme measures as human sacrifices were apart of the earliest Mithraic rituals, but the religion became less brutal andmore sophisticated as it was adopted by the Roman nobility. One of Rome’sgreatest military emperors, Julian Augustus, was a Mithraic initiate. Uponassuming the throne he waged a campaign against the Christian bishopswho had gained control of the bureaucracy under Constantine. Julian’svaliant restoration of the Greek/Roman pantheon was ended by his deathin Asia Minor in 363 CE. [For a well-written profile of the period, you mightinvestigate Gore Vidal’s historical novel Julian.]Mithraic initiates passed through seven grades or degrees: Raven,Occult, Soldier, Lion, Persian, Runner of the Sun, and Father. Each degreewas identified by distinctive robes and masked headpieces. Sunday wasconsidered sacred to Mithra, and his birthday - the “Birth of the Sun” - wascelebrated on … December 25th! 837 Historical estimates of Christ’s actualbirth date range from October to March, and it is likely that the popularChristmas date was merely adopted from Mithraism to resolve theconfusion. So much for “Christmas”! 838Witchcraft traditionalists may bring up the point of an old Britishwitchcraft fire festival called Candlemas. It should now be obvious that the“prehistoric” occasion championed by the Wiccans is simply a distortion ofthe Asian/Mediterranean holiday as it was introduced by merchants,soldiers, and explorers from Phoenicia and Rome several hundred yearsbefore the onset of Christianity. 839 And there is strong evidence that the836 Actually the term “Grotto” within the Church of Satan was a pure Anton LaVeyconcept, but I thought this Mithraic attribute was a rather tidy correspondence,andthere was no objection from San Francisco.837 As distinct from December 21-22, the South Solstice.838 Cf. “The Gods of Christmas” by Margaret A. Wendall IV° in Scroll of Set#I-4,December X/1975.839 It’s not that obvious. Stonehenge, a solar temple and observatory, ispre-Roman &Phœnician! On the other hand I’d bet that there was a lot of Mithraic materialin“Druidism” as it evolved through the Roman occupation.- 925 -Baphomet is none other than Mithra, the Sun-God of Peace and Plenty -whose emblem was a horned bull. 840And so our best wishes to you for a joyous holiday season! Let the treesbe trimmed, the logs be lit, and the banquettes joined! For it is the time ofMithra, whom we of the Church of Satan honor as Lucifer, Lord of Light -the Prince of Darkness and ArchDæmon Satan!There is death in the clouds,There is fear in the night,For the dead in their shroudsHail the Sun’s turning flight.And chant wild in the woods as they danceRound a Yule-altar fungous and white.- H.P. Lovecraft, “Yule Horror”Fungi From Yuggoth: Arkham House, 1963840 I don’t know what particular evidence I might have had in mind, except thatthe twosymbols share horns and connotations of virility.- 926 -- 927 -Appendix 37: “Psychology of the Blood-Vampire”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #IV-1, January VII/1972The Cloven Hoof has been receiving a large number of inquiriesconcerning vampirism, both psychic and sanguine. Many membersapparently interpret the Satanic Bible’s discussion of psychic vampirism assomehow exclusive of the good old fangs-in-the-neck species. In fact, bothtypes of vampirism are important concepts in Satanism, and the question isinteresting enough to warrant further treatment in the Hoof. Whilevampirism is a worldwide concept, we are principally interested in thewestern European tradition, as it is notable for two key characteristics: (1)its peculiar relationship with Christianity, and (2) its glorification of theUndead state.The word “vampire” has a multitude of possible origins. We think itmost probably derives from the Magyar vampyr or the Russian vopyr, bothterms of 18th-century vintage. In the 18th and 19th centuries, at any rate,vampires came on strong. There are literally hundreds of vampire attacksrecorded in almost every area of the European subcontinent, and most ofthem include the eventual discovery and destruction of the Undead culprit.It was not until recently that psychologists and historians thought tocorrelate the scares to the periodic outbreaks of contagious diseases. At thattime the true causes of most epidemics were unknown, and the mysteriousdeaths of a number of healthy people in a single locale were more thanlikely to be attributed to a vampire in the vicinity.When the city of Danzig was struck by cholera in 1855, vampires weresaid to be ravaging the area. A later occurrence of diphtheria in Rumaniawas responsible for the disinterring and mutilation of 30 corpses suspectedof being nosferatu. The occasional discovery of victims of premature burial[which was not all that uncommon at a time when catalepsy and temporarycessation of respiration were as yet unknown] reinforced the legend. Whena coffin was opened and found to contain a hideously-contorted body with aghastly facial expression and blood-drenched teeth, how could vampirismbe denied? Even such ordinary developments as the continued growth ofthe fingernails were sufficient to “prove” vampirism.As Frazier indicated in the Golden Bough, the sacrifice of one’s god inorder to preserve one’s own life and prosperity is a common enoughprocedure. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in Christianity, wherethe god is slain and resurrected on an annual basis (Easter and Christmas)- 928 -in order to save his followers from punishment or ill fortune. The Catholics,however, perpetuated a curious practice - the “Holy Communion” - whichhas survived in one form or another in most of the Christian sects. Throughthis procedure the devout assimilate the immortal and godlike qualities ofChrist by eating a piece of his “flesh” and drinking his “blood”. ThusChristianity, in addition to being death-worship [in that it venerates thesupposed afterlife above true life] is also an international vampire cult!This concept is crucially important to the popular notion of vampires.The drinking of Christ’s blood to attain immortality is sanctified, but thenotion that immortality can also be secured by drinking “ordinary” blood isan affront to the god. It was necessary to the Christian mythos that blood-vampires be creatures of the Devil, and that their immortality be of aparticularly hideous quality - that of existence as a reanimated corpse whocannot bear even the light of the Sun.One would think that such an Undead existence ought to beunattractive, but, in spite of such distasteful trimmings, the vampire istremendously alluring to a great many persons of decidedly respectabledispositions. Dracula, as both book and motion picture, enjoyed recordsuccess, and Dark Shadows’ Barnabas Collins touched off an internationalfilm craze approached only by James Bond (who displays both sadistic andsexual vampire characteristics himself). The public is fascinated by peoplewho deliberately prey upon other people and do not apologize for it.Every vampire-victim, of course, becomes Undead in turn. This is anessential part of the core psychology. By surrendering to his unspoken [andthus dreaded] desires, the subject becomes the monster. The true self - thatof a vicious, carnal creature that preys upon other humans - is liberated.The new vampire is scornful of social taboos and of the normal concepts ofmorality. He lives according to the law of the jungle, consciously andintentionally manipulating and using persons who are too stupid or tooweak to destroy him. he defies “God’s” ultimate threat of death bycontinuing to live in spite of his “natural” death, and he laughs at theHellish symbolisms that strike terror into the hearts of the ignorant. Yet heis invariably a gentleman, an aristocrat, and a scholar. In short, he is aSatanist!Yes, almost every characteristic of true Satanism is caricatured in thepopular myth of the blood-vampire. As Satanists we admit to ourvampirism and glory in it. Armed with knowledge of the arts that mostpeople regard as “supernatural”, we master our conditioned fear of death byrefusing to allow its dominance of our decisions. We are abhorrent to the- 929 -professors of theism because we are living proof that religion is notnecessary to a pleasurable and positive existence. [As to whether or not youcan see your reflection in a mirror, we suspect this depends upon howattractive you consider yourself to be.]And now to psychic vampirism, which is, of course, decidedlyunSatanic. The principal difference is that, while the blood-vampire livesby strength and cunning, his psychic counterpart perpetuates his miserableexistence by a continual display of personal weakness and helplessness. Theobject is to incite pity or sympathy, and thereby to secure patronage andprotection. The Christian parallel is obvious, as the believer mustacknowledge his helplessness and imperfection before becoming eligible forthe salvation that the god has to offer. A clear distinction is thus apparentbetween the two psychological mores governed by the term “vampirism”.[Note: The psychotic forms of vampirism - such as necrophagy,necrophilia, and necrosadism - are considered to be outside the realm ofphilosophical consideration, inasmuch as those suffering from theseobsessions rarely display more than the most cursory rationale for theircravings. The “vampire” fantasies of such unfortunates are largely born ofcontact with film-style portrayals of the Undead. Along this line it isinteresting to note that Count Dracula is perhaps the only “fictitious”personage with whom psychotics tend to identify themselves. Even thefamous Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi, who immortalized the character onthe screen, firmly believed he was Dracula when he died in a clinic in 1956.]Fangs for the MemorySpeaking of vampires, one of our Regional Agents in Canada recentlynotified the Cloven Hoof that a biography concerning the real Dracula is tobe published this coming month. The exact title is not yet known, but thebook is by two Boston College professors, Dr. Radu Florescu and Dr.Raymond McNally.We understand that the two authors spent a major portion of the lastthree years searching through Rumania and Hungary for traces of the 15th-century prince whose infamous exploits of cruelty and terrorism inspiredBram Stoker to name his celebrated vampire after him. Stoker, in fact,explicitly identified his Dracula as the Voivode Dracula in an early segmentof “Jonathan Harker’s Journal”, although he took the personal mannerismsof his character from the British actor Henry Irving “with his hissing and- 930 -terrible voice”, whose secretary he had been. Stoker himself, by the way,was a one-time member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.The Castle Dracula is located atop a 300-foot precipice in Wallachianear to the Transylvanian border. A television film documentary wasannounced one year ago, but it seems to have given way to the book. Duringhis reign from 1456 to 1462, the prince killed an estimated 100,000 peopleby burning, impaling, and mass slaughter.* * *Following the publication of the above article, Diane LaVey wrote to me(January 6, 1972):Karla especially liked the article on vampires; it’s her pet subject. Sherecently debuted as a lecturer, when her English teacher at City College askedher to give a talk to one of her other classes on the subject of vampires afterKarla had turned in an A-graded report on all aspects of the Undead.Vampirism seems to be a fascinating topic to anyone who is even mildlyinterested in the unknown, bizarre, or offbeat. Whenever the Master’svampirism lecture came up in the series of lectures he gave at one time, weknew it was time to haul out the extra chairs and cross our fingers that the oldfloor held up under the standing-room-only turnout. So I’m sure the membersappreciated your piece this month.I should mention something Anton pointed out when reading the article,though. Lugosi did not die in a clinic, but in his own home on the evening ofAugust 16, 1956. His wife, Hope, left their apartment on Harold Way to buygroceries at a store a few blocks away, leaving him resting in bed. Heapparently had died shortly before she returned around seven o’clock, forwhen she called to him, he didn’t respond, and she could feel no pulse.I would guess that the reports of his belief that he was Dracula mighthave resulted from the relatively common knowledge of his intense fear ofdeath. Even though his fatal heart attack came at age 73, which wouldn’t beregarded as premature considering his drug-addiction, he had told his wifejust three nights before his death that he was most definitely still afraid ofdying, when she asked him about it. While trying to comfort him, sheevidently found he was not about to extend a cordial welcome to the GrimReaper, regardless of anything she told him, for she is quoted as saying later:“You might as well save your breath with people like that. They’re still goingtobe afraid of death.” He was buried two days after his death at Lot 120 in theGrotto (!) section of Holy Cross Cemetery in Hollywood.Lugosi did commit himself to the Los Angeles General Hospital mentalhealth and hygiene department on April 21, 1955 [at the time weighing 125 lbs.- on a 6’1” frame which formerly carried 179 lbs!]. But he spent only one nightthere, for after attending a 45-minute court hearing the next day, Superior- 931 -Judge Wallace Ward granted that Lugosi be committed to Metropolitan StateHospital in Norwalk, Calif. for a minimum of 3 months or a maximum of 2years. He was released, after passing a staff health examination, on August 5,1955.He had spent only a little more than 3 months in the hospital and statedto Newsweek upon his release that his rehabilitation was “the greatest thingthat ever happened to me”. Nevertheless his unfortunate experience had beenexploited a great deal by the press, and because of the general public’spredictable preference to remember only the sordid details of his later years,little has been said about his apparently happy marriage to his last (5th) wife,Hope Linninger. She had been a fan-correspondent of Lugosi since the 30s,and at the time of their marriage was a clerk in a film studio editingdepartment. They married on April 24, 1955 and moved to an apartment at5620 Harold Way (between Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards), where helived out his remaining days in domestic harmony despite his old age. He wascompletely cured of the drug addiction, although he was seriously hamperedarthritis and suffered deafness in one ear.As an aside, Dr. Florescu and Dr. McNally contacted the Master aroundmid-1970, asking for any additional information he might have on vampirismin general and Dracula in particular. He wrote back offering some new leads,but told them it would take a book to tell them everything he knew on thesubject, adding that he intended to write such a book one day, so wasdisinclined to give away all of his material for same! I really look forward tohis writing a book on vampirism; it’s a subject into which he could really sinkhis teeth [pun unpremeditated, honest!]. In the same vein, he has onecontemporary vampire case for which any investigator on the subject wouldgive his eye teeth, and it’s documented by official S.F.P.D. records and photos… only they aren’t aware of it.- 932 -- 933 -Appendix 38: “The First Philosopher”- by Michael A. Aquino III°The Cloven Hoof #IV-1, January VII/1972Hope you enjoyed last issue’s venture into the Great Pyramid. We’ll beback to the Egyptians in depth later, but it is just as important to trace thecourse of Satanism throughout the many ages and environments whichcontributed to its final formulation in our own time. Hence a few wordsconcerning Pythagoras, that enigmatic Greek mathemagician who rightlydeserves the honor of being “the first of the philosophers”.[The term “philosopher” (lover of wisdom) was used by the ancientHellenes in intentional contrast to the word “sophist” (professor ofwisdom). The self-proclaimed sophists became so obnoxious in theirpomposity that the more objective theorists refused to be identified withthem.]Pythagoras was born on the Ægean island of Samos in 582 BCE. Thereare no written records of his early life, and he left no history of his latermagisterial experiences, but accounts by his pupils and contemporariespermit a piecemeal biography. 841 In 549, when he was 33 years of age, hepresented himself at the court of the last Pharaoh of the XXVI (Saite)Dynasty, Amasis. Via a petition from his own ruler, Polycrates, herequested initiation into the Priesthood of Amon-Ra at Uast (Thebes).Although originally reluctant to admit an alien to their circles, thepriests of Uast were finally won over by Pythagoras’ sincerity anddemonstrated endurance of the many tests they set for him. He spent thenext 22 years in Egypt, returning to Greece only when Cyrus the Great ofPersia sacked and burned the temples at Uast during his expedition toEgypt in 527.Pythagoras, now 40, traveled to the Greek colonies in the southern partof the Italian peninsula, established a college of science and mathematics inthe town of Crotona, and proceeded to dominate the intellectual climate ofthe region for the next 20 years.Although personally a political liberal, Pythagoras organized his schoolalong the highly autocratic lines of those of his Egyptian teachers. Pupilswere divided into two classes: neophytes (who were instructed inelementary subjects on a probationary basis) and initiates (who were841 An excellent biographical study of Pythagoras has since been published:Pythagoras:A Life by Peter Gorman. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979.- 934 -familiarized with the true principles of geometry and mathematics thatPythagoras had learned in Egypt). Three years of instruction were requiredof neophytes, and five more were demanded of initiates before completionof the course. Extensive periods of total silence had to be observed, and noquestioning of Pythagoras’ doctrines was permitted. Students found to be“deficient in intellect” were promptly expelled from the academy andtreated henceforth as total strangers.During this period the philosopher cut quite a romantic figure. Henever left the college during daylight, speaking to his students from behinda closed curtain. When he ventured forth at night, he appeared in flowingrobes and accessories designed to reinforce his popular image as the godHyperborean Apollo. Pious fraud was thus another of his mannerisms, butit seems that the Greeks were not so gullible as the Egyptians: The collegewas attacked by a mob of “deficient intellectuals” in 507 and entirelydestroyed [together with 40 of the students].Pythagoras himself fled to the Temple of the Muses at Metapontum,where, after being besieged by a mob for over a month, he finally perished.The many branches of the Pythagorean Brotherhood, however, were tocontinue in strength in Greece, Italy, and Sicily for many years thereafter.Counted among their initiates were such famous individuals as Plato andIamblicus.While Pythagoras cannot be acclaimed as the author of the severalgeometric principles that are usually attributed to him [such as the“Pythagorean Theorem”], he is undoubtedly responsible for thepreservation of important doctrines after the final corruption and downfallof the Khemite colleges of esoterica. As an example, Pythagoras designatedthe pentagram as the ensign of his Brotherhood, instituting death as thepenalty for revealing its mathematical significance. This “secret” of thepentagram was that its five lines crossed one another in the exact ratio ofthe “Golden Section”. And, to return to Giza for a moment, the side of apentagram inscribed in a circle whose circumference is equal to theperimeter of the Great Pyramid will equal the slant height of the Pyramid,which again equals the value for the Golden Section.In a way it is bitterly ironic that the pentagram, which is thus soingenious a polygram, should have been denigrated to the status of asymbol of Wiccan superstition and ignorance. How many of the Wiccanbooks can you open that do not have the TE TRA GRAM MA TON businessinside?- 935 -Among Pythagoras’ other convictions were a hatred for all forms ofwarfare and a deep love for all animal life at a time when animal sacrificeswere very much in vogue. He is one of the key figures of the human race, aSatanic Master, and indeed the first among Greece’s famous lovers ofwisdom.- 936 -- 937 -Appendix 39: “Official Degrees of the Church of Satan”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-3, March VII/1972In response to many requests for information concerning the magicaldegree structure of the Church, the Council of Nine has authorized theCloven Hoof to publish the following description, which is necessarily of anabbreviated nature:The Church incorporates a total of five degrees, each of which has bothan official and a ceremonial title. These degrees are as follows:DegreeOfficial TitleCeremonial TitleV°Magister SatanasMagusIV°Magister MagnusSorcerer (m) or Sorceress (f)Magister TempliMagister CaverniIII°Priest or Priestess of MendesWizard (m) or Enchantress (f)II°Brother/Sister of the CauldronWarlock (m) or Witch (f)I°Active MemberApprenticeFirst Degree: This degree encompasses the general membership ofthe Church. Over 95% of the membership-at-large and the chartered Grottoregistrants hold this degree as evidence of their formal commitment to thephilosophy of Satanism. Upon admission to active membership, allSatanists receive this degree, and it continues in force indefinitely unless(a) an individual voluntarily terminates his membership or (b) hismembership is arbitrarily terminated by the Council of Nine. Recipients ofthe I° are entitled to wear the Sigil of Baphomet in black against a redbackground, and their ceremonial robes are completely black.Second Degree: This degree is awarded by the Council of Nine tothose members who demonstrate their proficiency in the doctrines of theChurch through successful completion of a special examination. The degreeis awarded semiannually [in February and August], and it constitutesofficial recognition of the recipient’s magical prowess by the Church. As II°members are authorized to hold positions as Grotto Leaders and RegionalAgents, a more extensive background investigation is also conducted priorto the award of the degree. Recipients of the II° are entitled to wear the Sigilof Baphomet in black against a white background, and their ceremonialrobes are completely black.- 938 -The I° and II° constitute the lay membership of the Church of Satan.The III°, IV°, and V° identify the official hierarchy of the Church - the Orderof the Trapezoid, which is also known as the Black Order of Mendes. Sincethe Black Order encompasses the officialdom of the Church, lay memberscannot aspire to admission unless they desire the responsibilities andobligations of the Satanic clergy.Third Degree: This degree is awarded by the Council of Nine toaspirants who successfully complete the requirements for the SatanicPriesthood. In addition to formal evaluation - such as a writtenexamination and extensive seminarial training under the Order’ssupervision - the aspirant must possess a background of such character,integrity, and magical ability that he or she can safely be entrusted with theexecutive authority of the Church. Consequently a meticulous backgroundinvestigation will be conducted in each case. Among the secular criteriaunder evaluation will be the following:• Job or professional stability.• Social bearing.• Relationship with spouse.• Special abilities (languages, talents, etc., in which outstanding ability inatleast one area should be present).• Ability to maintain relationships (long-term friendships prior to affiliationwith Church - if none, reasons).• Economic stability (assets/liabilities).• Residential stability (homeowner - if not, reasons).• Family reaction (likelihood of difficulties arising from antagonisms).• Make, year, and condition of automobile.• Living conditions (type of home, outsiders’ impressions, style of decor).• Personal appearance (distinctive but socially dignified).• Life-style (leisure pursuits, social haunts, dining preferences, etc.).• Attitude and behavior towards non-human animals.• Conversational ability (non-esoteric versatility a must).Candidates for the Priesthood must have attained the II° of the Church.Chartered Grotto Leaders and Regional Agents may apply to the Council asa prerogative of their offices. Other members may write to the Secretary ofthe Central Grotto for information concerning prerequisite actions infurtherance of the Satanic philosophy. After the Council has had the chanceto observe the individual’s performance in a semiofficial capacity, adecision will be made.- 939 -Fourth Degree: This degree is awarded only by the High Priest, and itconstitutes recognition as a Master of the Realm. The three separate titleswithin the IV° are used to indicate the official position of the Master withinthe Church of Satan’s administrative structure. Magister Caverni, MagisterTempli, and Magister Magnus correspond respectively to the administrativefunctions of bishop, archbishop, and cardinal. The Cloven Hoof is not"},{"pageContent":"authorized to release information concerning the qualifications for the IV°.Recipients wear the Pentagram of Satan against a black background, andtheir ceremonial robes are black with blue trim.Fifth Degree: The Cloven Hoof is not authorized to releaseinformation concerning the V°.

Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-3, March VII/1972As incorporated into the Satanic Ritual, the Chalice of Ecstasysymbolically endows the Priest or celebrant with the knowledge of thePowers of Darkness. Through the Elixir of Life the magician absorbs theforce of the ceremony into his material being, in order that he may breakthe bonds of preordained natural law and inflict his will upon themechanisms of the Universe. But, while the Elixir thus serves an importantfunction in Black Magic, the vessel itself possesses a crucial significance -one which is perhaps not immediately apparent to the practitioner. For theChalice of Ecstasy is the embodiment of that most enigmatic and esotericsymbol - the Grail.Such a statement may cause some initial consternation. Isn’t the Grail arelic of the Christian mythos? According to the popular tale, it was the cupfrom which Jesus Christ drank at the Last Supper, after which it was usedby Joseph of Arimathea to catch the blood of the crucified savior. It wasthen sealed and dispatched to Britain, where, because of its holy qualities, itbecame the object of an intense search by the knights of King Arthur’sRound Table. It was finally found by Sir Perceval [or Sir Galahad],whereupon it vanished from the Earth.Such is the version which has come to us via the Western Christiantradition. A careful examination into the source material of the Graillegends, however, presents us with a far more complex portrait of the objectin question. Like many other “Christian” symbols, the Grail is actually thelegacy of an older, more sinister myth-cycle - one which is properly theconcern of the Church of Satan.The roots of the Grail tradition are all but extinct. Various scholarshave suggested its literary origin in Persia, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Phœnicia,Spain, and even China and Mongolia. But it may just as easily be Celtic,Irish, or Scandinavian. We are archaeologists only incidentally, however;our present interest lies in the substance of the legend.- 942 -Of the scores of books which touch upon the Grail, 842 one of the mostexcellent is The Grail Legend by Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz.Originally published for the C.G. Jung Foundation for AnalyticalPsychology, it approaches the Grail from a number of contrastinghypotheses, some of which we shall examine in this article. We highlyrecommend this volume to you, but shun A.E. Waite’s The Holy Grail,which will only put you to sleep.Jung identifies three major histories of the Grail from among the manyversions that have been recorded. The eldest is Chrétien de Troyes’ LiContes del Graal, a cycle of poems written during the last half of the 12thcentury CE. Slightly later came Robert de Boron’s Roman de l’Estoire douGraal (about 1180-1199), a 3-part saga containing the stories of Joseph ofArimathea, Merlin, and Perceval. Finally there is the best-known and mostelaborate version, Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival, completed in about1207 CE.Although there are certain distinctions between each version, the basicstory of the Grail is fairly consistent:After various exploits Sir Perceval, a knight of the Round Table, findshimself at the edge of an unknown river. A richly-garbed fisherman directshim to a strange castle, which materializes mysteriously before the knightupon his approach. Upon entering, Perceval is welcomed by the Grail King,who is revealed to be the fisherman as well. In his side is an open woundwhich will not close. The king presents Perceval with a sword and inviteshim to dine. A procession enters the hall, with maidens carrying the Grail, aspear that is dripping blood, and a finely-worked platter. Perceval fears toask the meaning of these curious artifacts, and the king, castle, and Grailvanish. An oracle tells him that his failure to inquire into the meaning of theGrail caused the castle to disappear, and that the king and kingdom willcontinue to suffer until Perceval has found them again.After a series of adventures, Perceval again finds the Grail castle. Thistime he asks the proper questions, and the king’s wound is healed.Prosperity returns to the kingdom, and the king dies naturally a short timelater. Perceval then becomes the new King of the Grail.In the Christian interpretation the Grail was the cup of Christ, while thespear was the one which wounded him during the crucifixion. No842 The definitive treatment of the symbolism of the Grail [and many otherthings] in theParsifal opera of Richard Wagner is Franz E. Winkler’s For Freedom Destined(GardenCity, New York: Waldorf Press Publishers, 1974). This volume also contains thedefinitive treatment of the symbolism in Wagner’s Ring cycle.- 943 -significant meaning is ascribed to the platter. The sword, according to onesource, was originally the sword of David, reworked by Solomon,enchanted, and finally sent via a magical ship to Solomon’s finaldescendant for use in the Grail quest. The four devices, according toCavendish, have been used to name the four suits of the Tarot deck.The word “grail” originated, according to some authorities, in the Latingradale (deep plate or bowl). Others suggest that it is derived from grele(hailstone), and consequently there is some confusion as to whether theGrail is a cup or a stone. In de Troyes it is described only as a “vessel”; deBoron identifies it as a chalice; von Eschenbach pronounces it a stone:They [the Knights of the Grail] live from a stone of purest kind.If you do not know it,It shall here be named to you.It is called lapsit exillis.This curious description has given rise to additional conjecture. Oneauthority corrects it to lapsit ex cœlis, a derivation of the Greek term formeteorites, “stone with a spirit”. Various legends depict the Grail as a jewelthat fell from Satan’s crown during the First Seraphic War, while vonEschenbach relates that it was subsequently guarded on Earth by thezwivelære (doubters), the Angels who took neither side in the conflict.Alchemists in the audience will immediately suspect another allusion tothe stone Grail - the famous Philosopher’s Stone. It is noteworthy that theStone in alchemy is identified with the alchemical Mercurius, a being ofdual aspect who may be identified with Baphomet. According to Jung thePhilosopher’s Stone - and thus the Grail - is “a matrix in which thearchetype of the self is transformed” [which means that it changes yourbasic personality, in case you aren’t as Jung as you’d like to be]. An old textentitled Allegoriæ Sapientum observes: “Thus our Stone, that is the flask offire, is created from fire.” The elemental of the Stone is the dragon, which, ifyou’re really prone to wild speculation, brings to mind the name ofPerceval’s [and Arthur’s] ancestor, Uther Pendragon (“Dragon’s Head”).If, on the other hand, the Grail is considered a cup, variations upon thetheme are abundant throughout mythology. In ancient Egypt the vitalfluids/organs of the dead were buried with special veneration in jarsbearing the heads of Horus’ four sons. In Orphic Gnosticism reverence wasgiven to the Cup of Anacreon, as it imparted divine knowledge. Accordingto the ancient Persians, all the world’s mysteries could be perceived in theCup of Jamshyd, while Mohammed, during one of his Astral expeditions,- 944 -glimpsed “a goblet of greenish brilliance” illuminating all of the sevenheavens. In the 3rd century CE the Egyptian Gnostic Zosimos of Panopolisenvisioned a cosmic altar in the form of a shallow bowl, “in which men intorment were being cooked to attain a state of spirituality”(!).A discussion of the Grail invariably leads to the nature of its guardian,the Grail King or Fisher King. Alluded to as Pelles or Pellam, he bearsstriking resemblances to the Welsh god of the underworld, Pywll or Pwcca.He is the master of the Knights of the Grail [or Knights Templeise,according to von Eschenbach], a secret order which intervenes onlyoccasionally in worldly affairs. The relics of Christ cannot heal his wound;instead he seeks a fish from the river. Now the fish is a symbol of Christ, butChrist has already proven ineffective in healing the king. So he is nowseeking a second fish.Jung mentions a passage from “The Revelation of John”, a text of theCatharists (a sect in southern France which was persecuted for heresyduring 1207-1229 CE and which was associated with the Templars). In thistext it is recounted that Satan visited the world shortly after its creation andsaw two fish lying together on the primal waters, yoked together and“holding the whole Earth”. The sect taught that there were two sons of God- Christ and Satanæl - who ruled the Earth according to the principle ofduality. The Era of the Second Fish began ca. 1000 CE, when religioncommenced to fragment, and when the onset of alchemy and otherprimitive research disciplines foreshadowed the development of modernscience with its anti-Christian rationalism and materialism. And so thecraving of the suffering king for the Second Fish!Then, of course, there is the matter of Perceval, who is also the “fish”for which the king is searching. In contrast to Adam, he errs by failing toinquire, and it is only when he succeeds in inquiry that the king andkingdom are healed. He then becomes King of the Grail: Man as Satan.The Grail, then, as represented by the Chalice of Ecstasy, is a challengewhich the magician must accept before aspiring to the Powers of Darkness.Within it is not the blood of an impotent god - but an Elixir of Life that fireshis own blood with the brilliance of Hell.- 945 -Appendix 41: Church of SatanMembership Form Statement- by Anton Szandor LaVeyreprinted in The Cloven Hoof #IV-3, March VII/1972It is not easy to be a member of the Church of Satan; however, anallegiance to the concepts of Satanism is anyone’s prerogative. Anyone mayperform Satanic rites and propagate Satanic thought, independent ofmembership in the Church of Satan. Official affiliation with the Church ofSatan does not give one a stronger voice insofar as personal expression ofSatanism is concerned. If you are “fired up” and wish to proselytize thecontents of the Satanic Bible or gather others together for ceremonies,pursuing Satanism on an evangelical level, you would function best as anonmember. By remaining unaffiliated you will have greater freedom ofaction, fewer personal restrictions, no organizational obligations, and rankof your own choosing.Satanism is a philosophy, a magical curriculum, a movement - a way oflife. The Church of Satan is an organization whose machinations havespawned that movement, and which serves as a guideline and inspiration tothose who rightfully call themselves Satanists.Through the magical genius of Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey, the Church ofSatan was created as a foundation for a legitimate faith whose time hadcome. The very real magic which has emanated from the Church of Satanhas provided a climate and opportunity whereby Satanism might be openlypracticed for the first time in history. The magic that will create newopportunities and greater legitimacy for Satanists will likewise emerge fromthe Church of Satan.Being an organization, the Church of Satan is governed by strictprotocol and, as the Infernal machinery behind contemporary Satanism,must be properly maintained. Though Satanism is of the here and now, theChurch of Satan is primarily concerned with the future and itsramifications. There is no place for physically resolvable personalproblems, nor surcease from the torments of unfulfilled desires within ourorganizational precincts - despite early propaganda to the contrary. It isalways easy to agree with something that promises abundant rewards. TheChurch of Satan is not a haven for those who anxiously await the Devil’sblessing. Personal success - or salvation - is not dependent upon secularinvolvement.- 946 -The price one pays for membership in the Church of Satan is negligiblefrom a financial standpoint. In other ways it is most dear. Assistancecommensurate with one’s station may be drawn upon. One’s positioninside the Church is governed by one’s position outside the Church. Asabove, so below.We realize that when desire for authority burns bright in an incapableindividual, no amount of informed logic will stifle his drive, andintrospection is a quality usually conspicuous for its absence. The “PeterPrinciple” or “enough rope” need not be bestowed on such individuals. Itwill invariably be demanded, generally being requisitioned from whateversources are available.We have no desire to over inflate leaky egos within our membership.An organization based on a philosophy of ego-gratification must thereforeoccasionally resort to subterfuge in order to isolate its highest humanpotential. Consequently our administrative methodology may sometimesappear nefarious. There are, however, valid reasons.We cannot shame and degrade our members by threats of Hell andhopes of Paradise, as can other faiths. Our Bible tells all men and womenthat they are gods and goddesses. Those who read and heed those wordsbelieve in their newly-acquired sovereignty and become inclined to passjudgment, as gods are known to do. An entire organization filled with suchunbridled dominion could not fail to fall victim to chaos if uncontrolled.Thus, while Satanism is a religion of individual freedom, the Church ofSatan must have order.- 947 -Appendix 42: “Evil, Anyone?”- Newsweek, August 16, 1971“What democracies in general and America in particular most lack isbelief in the Devil,” argued Swiss philosopher Denis de Rougemont in hisclassic study of the diabolic in modern society a quarter century ago. But iffew Americans outside the Bible Belt were willing then to give the Devil hisdue, today tens of thousands across the U.S. - some of them middle-classadults with advanced university degrees - are dabbling in Satanism,witchcraft, voodoo, and other forms of Black or White Magic.Much of the interest in Satanism, of course, is mere fad, a trendy spin-off from the culture-wide interest in the occult. And some of it is sheerfantasy produced by drug-induced paranoia. But a good deal of the arcaneexperimentation results from plain, blind faith in Satanic power, whichsometimes produces macabre acts of violence and sex that in lessenlightened eras of U.S. history would have brought the perpetrators swiftpunishment at the stake.Just last month, Kim Brown, a long-haired Satanist who swears sheonce saw the Devil himself during a black ceremony, was convicted ofmanslaughter for stabbing a 62-year-old man to death. “I really enjoyedkilling him,” she said last week in her Miami jail cell between elaboraterituals to Satan. “I even had an orgasm while stabbing him.” For her crimesthe 22-year-old brunette was given 7 years in prison - a remarkably lightsentence that she attributes to the intercession of Satan.Grave: Miss Brown’s crime is not the only killing done this summer inSatan’s name. In June, residents of Vineland, N.J. were horrified todiscover that two local youths had killed a third, Patrick Michael Newell, atthe slain boy’s request. Newell had apparently convinced his friends that bydying at their hands he could count on being returned to Earth by Satan asleader of a legion of lesser devils. In Los Angeles, police are stillinvestigating the murder, a year ago, of an Orange County schoolteacherwhose heart, lungs, and other parts of her body found missing from thegrave were used in a bloody sacrifice to the Devil.Police and psychiatrists who have investigated each of these crimestend to dismiss the Satanic elements as manifestations of mentalderangement. Oddly, though, most of those convicted or suspected of thekillings have demonstrated some kind of involvement with the Church ofSatan. Yet the Church’s “Black Pope”, Anton Szandor LaVey, vehementlydenies any connection between the killings and the 10,000 dues-paying- 948 -members of his flock. Satanism, he insists, is “developing two circles: anelitist group which I always intended my church to be, and the faddists whoare becoming Satanists because it’s the thing to do.” Indeed, far frompreaching sexual or political anarchy, LaVey describes his goal as thecreation of a police state in which the weak are weeded out and the“achievement-oriented leadership” is permitted to pursue the mysteries ofBlack Magic.Nude: When he founded the Church of Satan in 1966, LaVey and hisdisciples staged a black-wedding rite, complete with a nude womanstretched out as an altar, to help boost the sect’s devilish image. TodayLaVey continues to cut a properly demonic profile with his shaven head,satyr-like goatee, and black clerical collar, and at his comfortable blackhouse in San Francisco he still likes to usher outsiders into a sinister innersanctum hidden behind a swinging bookcase. But the total effect, reportsNewsweek’s Gerald Lubenow, looks more like a Charles Addams cartoonthan a medieval Satanist’s sanctuary. Indeed, LaVey’s sky-blue Jaguar(license number: SATAN 9) may reveal more about the Black Pope’s trueambitions than the zany trappings of his cult.If there is anything fundamentally diabolic about LaVey, it stems morefrom the echo of Nazism in his theories than from the horror-comictrappings of his cult. Among specialists who have studied demonology in itsancient, medieval, and modern forms, LaVey is dismissed as a manunworthy of the Devil’s trust. “The remarkable thing about this rise in devilworship is that it is a cult at all,” says Father Michael Griffin, professor ofmoral theology at the Carmelite monastery in Washington, D.C. “To go outand be wicked is understandable, but to go out of your way to surroundyourself with elaborate ritual is something else.”Magic: Even so there are thousands of Americans who believe thatspirits - good and evil - are close at hand for those who care to invoke them.In Boston and New York this summer, young evangels of the Church of theFinal Judgment, who worship both Christ and Satan, openly proselytize onthe streets. And even in staunchly Middle American cities such asCleveland, St. Louis, Albuquerque, and Chicago, white magic is spreadingas fast as witches can organize covens. There are some 80,000 “whitewitches” in the U.S., estimates Father Richard Woods, a philosophyinstructor at Chicago’s Loyola University, with 6,000 in Chicago alone ...Love: In contrast to many other clerics, Loyola’s Father Woods seesredeeming social value in white witchcraft, though he is frankly fearful ofSatanists. He admires the white witches’ dancing rituals and sense of love,- 949 -brotherhood, sharing, and achievement. “Sometimes a whole coven willconcentrate on helping one of the members,” he marvels, “and that is a verybeautiful thing to see.”Such sentiments - and from a clergyman - are further proof to someProtestant fundamentalists that Satan is surely building his kingdom in theU.S. “Devil worship is mushrooming,” warns the Rev. Billy James Hargis,the thundering evangelist of Tulsa’s Christian Crusade who for decades haspreached that Communism is Satan’s handiwork. “It ultimately will becomethe religion of the militants and the revolutionaries.” Nonetheless, evenmany conservative Protestants seem to retain their belief in the Devil onlybecause he is mentioned in the Bible. And Satan receives scant attentionfrom most mainstream Christian theologians - including Catholic priests,who are still ordained with the power to exorcise devils should the occasionarise. “For most theologians,” says Father Joseph Komonchak, professor ofdogmatic theology at New York’s St. Joseph’s Catholic seminary, “apersonal Devil is something of an embarrassment.”Freaks: Within the “Jesus movement” that is burgeoning in theyouthful counterculture, however, Satan enjoys stature as a formidable -and necessary - foil to Jesus. “I firmly believe we are in the last days beforeArmageddon,” warns the Rev. Sammy Tippit, a Southern Baptist preacherwho directs a community of Jesus people in Chicago. “Satan is coming onwith a really heavy thing. But Jesus is coming soon, and Satan’s not goingto win.”Ironically the Jesus movement may eventually do more to popularizeSatan among the young than all the devil-freak cults. But short ofArmageddon, the Devil, according to ancient Christian tradition, prefers todo his mischief incognito. As the Father of Lies, cautions philosopher deRougemont, the Devil’s greatest ploy is to convince men that the evil theycommit is not their own.- 950 -- 951 -Appendix 43: Letter to Fate Magazine- by Anton Szandor LaVeySeptember 1, VI/1971Gentlemen:I have enjoyed David Techter’s book reviews for quite some time. Imust, however, take exception to Donald Hanlon’s competence as areviewer in that department. Although the so-called “objective critic” isindeed a rare bird [if not in fact a mythical being], Mr. Hanlon’s lack ofobjectivity in his review of Arthur Lyons’ fine work The Second Coming:Satanism in America ( Fate, October 1971), is inexcusably unprofessionaland defeats the purpose the literary critique is intended to fulfill. His inepttreatment of this book, which is the first totally objective documentary onSatanism - past and present - is clearly the product of “sour grapes” overhaving been beaten to the punch, as it were, by Mr. Lyons. [Both Lyons andI have been contacted by Mr. Hanlon for the purpose of obtaining neededinformation for his proposed book on the same subject.]Donald Hanlon’s rather epimethean approach to the subject ofSatanism is evinced by his imperceptive evaluation and hackneyed criticismof the Church of Satan. Had similar criticism been expressed by anindividual who claims no practical knowledge of the occult norcomprehension of the principles of magic, the obvious lack of insight mightbe excused, but Mr. Hanlon purports to be an expert in these matters. Hischarge that the Church of Satan “narrows its aims to the achievement ofmaterial gain without mention of any form of spiritual illumination” is astrite as it is erroneous. Such naïvete is characteristic of the occult scholarwho, unable to produce concrete evidence (i.e. material achievement) of hismagical prowess, establishes his “credibility” by means of an “education”which consists of learning by rote everything available on the Black Arts.This is, of course, totally antithetical to the creative nature of the qualifiedmaster of the unknown.It has been mistakenly thought that Satanism is concerned only withmaterial accomplishment, forsaking any study towards a higher, moreabstract development. The reason the study of material phenomena isstressed is because if magic is to be recognized as a valid and essentialingredient in everyday life, it must divorce itself from the stigma ofesotericism. C.S. Lewis’ “materialist magician” is the cavalier who rides outof the night wherein tabooed and arcane theories have so long resided.- 952 -The world still abounds with occultists whose only protection fromtheir persecutors lies in their unfathomable abstractions. They have chosen,consciously or otherwise, the very weapon the men of God wield against themultitudes: bullshit, and more of it! This form of homeopathic magic islittle more than camouflage - protective coloration - of a different sort toallow the practitioner of heresy to exist among his would-be persecutors.The occultist’s grave mistake is in assuming that his abstract pursuitselevate him to a higher plane of existence per se … hence preparing him formore exalted enlightenment. In other words, he has employed his studiestowards abstract and spiritual development as a means of identity andsurvival rather than a means of growth and development.The Satanist, unlike the occultist, realizes that survival and its brother,recognition, have always flourished best on a diet of physical trappings andmaterial accomplishments. The Satanist believes that one should learnsufficient tricks of the trade in the game of life before embarking on thepath to Schamballah.Those who would criticize our neglect of the spirit are invariably thosewho have deplorably neglected their own understanding of the physicalworld. One day it will become common knowledge that a proficiency inhuman relationships and material achievements is a prerequisite formagical aptitude.Spiritual religions have always appealed to the have-nots … becauseone can be the greatest believer on the block and it won’t cost him a cent.Similarly a preoccupation with the abstract ingredients in magic iswitnessed in the can-do-nothings, because the implication exists thatsorcery is an inverse sort of miracle, attainable through swapping ascapular and prayer book for an athame and a course in Tarot reading.Any inference that the Church of Satan has “borrowed” from AleisterCrowley is only viable in that we consider some of his poetry to be worthy ofinclusion in our rites. Our admiration for Crowley rests on his literaryeloquence, certainly not on his drug-befuddled callings-up of Choronzon etal. As for the Process, the suggestion that we have “borrowed” from it is tooludicrous to warrant rebuttal. Anyone who has read the literature of theProcess should banish the remotest comparison.Your reviewer states that one should look within himself rather thangaze Heavenward or lower his sights towards the Pit. He is, whiledisparaging my philosophy, stating exactly that which I have constantlysaid. Methinks he wants to dance but his feet won’t let him!- 953 -Appendix 44: “That Other Black Order”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-4, April VII/1972“If there is anything fundamentally diabolic about LaVey, it stems fromthe echo of Nazism in his theories.”- Newsweek, August 16, 1971 CE.Well, is the Church of Satan neo-Nazi? This question is one which haspreoccupied more than one member. Either we are - and are consequentlyon a collision course with Western liberalism - or we aren’t, and, like it ornot, there is some sense of anticlimax. Sorry, but the Hoof isn’t going tomake it all that easy for you to place the Church in a mold; we harbor someideas about the Nazis that shade the issue more than you may have thought.[But, before proceeding further, some recommended reading: For ascenario of the times, William Shirer’s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reichhas yet to be surpassed. For a profile of Hitler see Alan Bullock’s Hitler, AStudy in Tyranny. Concerning SS methodology refer to H. Krausnick’sAnatomy of the SS State. For a closer look at the SS leadership there is R.Manvell’s Himmler. And, for an excellent analysis of the strictly Satanicelements in Nazism, see Louis Pauwels’ The Morning of the Magicians.Some of these are available in paperback, and your local library canprobably provide you with detailed information on the hardcover editions.]843843 Today, having made a much greater study of the field, I find my oldrecommendations thoroughly inadequate. As a general history of the Nazi regimefromHitler’s perspective I would now recommend David Irving’s The War Path (1978)andHitler’s War (2 volumes) (1977), both published by Viking Press, New York.Probablythe most exhaustive exoteric study of the SS is Heinz Hoehne’s The Order of theDeath’sHead, published in the United States by Ballantine Books (#25882) in October1971.The esoteric interests of the SS are surveyed in Nigel Pennick’s Hitler’s SecretSciences(Suffolk: Neville Spearman, 1981), and perhaps the only non-hystericalpsychologicalportrait of Himmler is Bradley F. Smith’s Heinrich Himmler (Stanford,California:Hoover Institution Press, 1971). The political culture of Germany whichultimatelyresulted in the Nazi phenomenon is best studied in Peter Viereck’s Metapoliticsfromthe Romantics to Hitler (New York: Knopf, 1941). For a psychological portrait ofHitler,I recommend Hermann Rauschning’s The Voice of Destruction (New York: G.P.Putnam’s Sons, 1940) and Hitler’s Table Talk (introduced by H.R. Trevor-Roper)(London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1953).- 954 -Why the emphasis on the SS? The fact of the matter is that theSchwarze Korps of the “Thousand-Year Reich” embodied a living blueprintfor the ideal National Socialist state [and indeed Himmler fully intended toestablish an autonomous SS nation following World War II844 ]. If we aregoing to critique the Nazi era, then we certainly ought to place our hoof onthe most potent indicator of the Nazi philosophy. And the Schutzstaffel wascertainly that.Almost every historian of the Third Reich feels morally obliged tocondemn the entire period as being some sort of national disease. It was afreakish aberration, but we eventually squashed it, so now the world can geton with civilized normalcy.The Hoof begs to differ. The true message of the episode is simply thatthere was nothing in the Nazi philosophy that conflicts with the basicdesires of the human personality. Accordingly attempts to moralize at theNazis’ expense are unrealistic. Worse than that, they are dangerous in thatthey breed an unmerited complacency in contemporary civilization.To illustrate our view, let us examine two interrelated aspects of the SS’design: its symbolism and its sense of morality. Such treatment mustnecessarily be somewhat abbreviated.The Schutzstaffel placed the highest possible emphasis on symbolism,visual and otherwise. Every facet of the organization was intentionallyportrayed so as to accent the elitism that the SS purported to foster. Thecolor black, for example, has always elicited feelings of fear and respect.Thus those who wish to dominate others invariably choose black attire,whether they be executioners, clergy, policemen, judges, Wiccans, orSatanists. So the SS was uniformed in black and silver after the example ofthe Italian Fascisti, and there was no question of its æsthetic appeal whencompared to its SA rival.The skull-and-crossbones may seem a rather juvenile insignia for aparamilitary organization, but, as the trademark of the SS, it produced thesame intimidation of opponents that the “Jolly Roger” did during the daysof sea piracy. In time the Nazis’ already-dynamic swastika was renderedeven more striking by turning it askance.845844 See in particular Infiltration: How Heinrich Himmler Schemed to Build an SSIndustrial Empire by Albert Speer. New York: Macmillan, 1981 CE.845 The visual difference between the “resting” swastika and the “balancing” oneof theNazis is not dissimilar to the visual difference between the obverse and inversepentagrams.- 955 -The mythology of the SS was keyed to the most compulsive idealisms ofthe Germanic cultures of northern Europe. Included were pan-Germanicracial supremacy [SS membership was eventually opened to “Aryans” inevery conquered country], imperialism, paganism, and the Wagnerianglorification of the martial arts. Its leaders both followed and encouragedpractices that, in the context of our Satanic ritual, included specific designfor both operative and illustrative effect. Consider the mass-hypnosis of theNürnberg party rallies [cf. Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will], thetorchlight ceremonies of the HitlerJugend, and the SS’ observance of Yule.According to one SS manual:On the day of the winter solstice the Sun rises again from its wintrygrave. This annual event was celebrated as the greatest festival of ourforbears.They advanced towards the Yule-night with firebrands to liberate the Sunfrom the bondage of wintry death, and thought of it as a young hero come torouse and free them from their deathlike sleep.On Christmas eve the main ingredients of the festive fare must be carp,roast goose, and wild boar - drawn respectively from the spheres of water, air,and earth. At the conclusion of the meal, the father uses the Yule candleholderto kindle the lights on the Yule-tree, leaving three candles unlit. The othermembers of the family and clan are summoned, and the father kindles theremaining three candles, saying: “This light shall burn in memory of ourancestors who are with us today. This light shall burn for my dead comradesfrom the war and the time of struggle, and this light shall burn to remind us ofall our German brethren across the globe celebrating Christmas with ustoday.”Far from being merely a propaganda technique to impress the Germanpublic, such symbolisms formed the core of the SS leaders’ guiding ethics.Richard Grunberger in his book Hitler’s SS observes the following:Himmler also viewed his own personality as big enough to accommodatethe shade of King Arthur of Round Table fame; he had the derelictWewelsburg Castle in Westphalia refurbished at considerable cost, andperiodically assembled the twelve highest-ranking Obergruppenführers (fullgenerals) of the SS round the oaken table of its lofty dining room. TheWewelsburg’s holy of holies was a subterranean shrine; plinths for theObergruppenführers’ cremation urns encircled a sunken well; on the death ofeach Knight of the Round Table his escutcheon was burnt on top of a- 956 -hollowed-out stone pillar, with the smoke - by means of a cunningly-arrangedventilation system - forming a vertical column above the well. 846The Nazis were not alone in their taste for exotic attire and flamboyantritual, certainly, but they were the first in modern times to govern anentire nation according to irrational principles. We are not talking merelyin terms of politics, obviously, because they can hardly be held responsiblefor setting a precedent in that non-discipline. But the Nazi idealists madethe fatal error of applying their emotional desires to the entire range ofstatistical science - mathematics, biology, genetics, architecture, physics,economics, and the like.Accordingly they lost their Einsteins, and those scientists and scholarswho did remain in the country were severely hampered in their respectivepursuits by the requirement that their doctrines and principles conform toNazi orthodoxy. Fantasia can be desirable to counterbalance the ego-dulling effects of pure materialism, but the introduction of irrationality intoscience will cause an instantaneous breakdown of experimental validity.Carried over into government and law, subjective idealism producesanarchy, despotism, and ultimately totalitarianism.When Pauwels speaks of “Martians at Nürnberg”, he is referring to thetotal ethical alienation of the Nazi leaders from their Allied judges.Extermination camp films that would horrify the average Westerner left SSofficials quite unmoved. Many observers attributed this to barbarism, but itwas rather a clash in frames of reference. Consider the miraculous success[at least until 1942] of Hitler’s seemingly nonsensical policies in advancingGerman prestige and influence in the world. Nothing succeeds like success,and the excesses of the regime could eventually be rationalized.To understand how the ferocity of the extermination camps could betolerated and even encouraged by the Germans, we need look no furtherthan our own backyard. Practically every nation on this planet has seenmassacres - ethnic, religious, or otherwise - that would do credit to themost rabid Nazi element. Yet such events as the American Indian Wars of846 This chamber, the Walhalla, was the site of my “Wewelsburg Working” onOctober19, XVII/1982. The Walhalla and indeed the rest of the Wewelsburg areerroneouslydescribed in virtually all popular accounts. I recommend Prof. Dr. Karl Hueser’sWewelsburg 1933 bis 1945: SS Kult- und Terrorstätte (Paderborn: VerlagBonifatiusDruckerei, 1982). In 2009 an extensive new anthology of articles, Die SS,Himmler, unddie Wewelsburg, Jan Erik Schulte (Ed.) (Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöningh) has beenpublished in German, including an excellent essay on the occult aspects of theWewelsburg by the castle museum scholar Daniela Siepe.- 957 -the last century are generally regarded by the average citizen with a certainpride. A rhetorical question: How might a Nazi historian have recorded thediscovery of enforced Indian reservations and Japanese-Americaninternment camps? The Cloven Hoof rests its case.If the tragedy of contemporary civilization is that it jealouslysuppresses the urge for Satanic individualism, then the tragedy of Nazismwas that it attempted to substitute subjective Satanism for the entirespectrum of social ethics. A revolution of the existing social order with“Satanism” as the behavioral standard of the world would be disastrous ineffect and impossible by definition.- 958 -- 959 -Appendix 45: “Purpose and Precognition”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-4, April VII/1972Several of our readers have written in to invite our attention to a newbook by Colin Wilson entitled The Occult: A History (New York: RandomHouse, 1971 CE). This formidable volume - 579 pages and a 6-pagebibliography - is the latest attempt to “define” the value of the esoteric arts-to distinguish, so to speak, between the significant and the nonsensical.Wilson himself enjoys no mean reputation as a writer, and his approach tothe subject is, at the very least, a painstaking one.Summarily The Occult is a history plus commentary plus speculation.The worth of the book rests primarily within the first category. WhileWilson rather dutifully re-gnaws all of the usual material from prehistory tothe present, his accounts do include some interesting anecdotes andincidents not previously published. Especially of note are the biographicalsketches of Rasputin and Crowley, two practitioners whose exploits meritmore than a cursory examination. 847It is unfortunately the case that Wilson’s dramatic impulse lends verbalcolor to the historical segment of the book at the occasional expense ofobjectivity. Consider his treatment of the early Christians: The movement islabeled “a great black shadow of intolerance, a super-totalitarianism thatmakes communism seem harmless by comparison”. The fledgling cult’spagan rivals, on the other hand, are represented as being far more placidand æsthetic. And this introduces a consideration important to Satanism:Those who presume to attack any institution would do well to takeextraordinary care that their judgments are not emotionally exaggerated.The first hint of bitterness or hysteria effectively destroys the credibility ofan argument.Ironically enough, the Satanist’s license to indulge in public slander isnonexistent, while that of his theological opponents is boundless. The issueis simply one of maturity; the ritual chamber’s function, in part, is toprovide release for the consequent frustration. If the Satanists were to visitthe same injustices upon the theists that conversely occurred during themedieval witchcraft persecutions, we would have no mandate to regard our847 Today I would take somewhat less note of the passage on Crowley, since it ismyfeeling that Wilson displays an anti-Crowley bias somewhat comparable to JohnSymonds’.- 960 -intellectual bases as superior to theirs. The question is not one of turningthe other cheek, but rather of handling our irrational rivals with thejudiciousness that a physician displays towards a psychotic. 848Early Christianity, in fact, was hardly the most rotten apple in thebarrel. Primitive civilization, such as it was, bred cruelty and exploitationwithin all disciplines of the Roman era. Life then was a far more ruthlessstruggle than it is in our pampered societies of this century, and allreligions merely reflect the times and circumstances in which they flourish.It is quite probable that, if the Mithraics had conquered their Christianrivals, the middle ages would have been every bit as intolerant as they wereunder the influence of the Holy Roman Empire. Only the semantics wouldhave changed. Thus it is both pointless and presumptuous to criticize theonset of Christianity. Its obsolescence in our own day, however, is quiteanother matter.But Wilson’s purpose in writing The Occult: A History, it soon becomesclear, was not simply to gain stature as a historian. The name of the book,accordingly, is somewhat misleading. In the introduction Wilson speaks ofa certain “Faculty X”, an Astral/PK/ psi/6th sense or whatever“breakthrough” that will finally permit man to realize “his true purpose inlife”. Wilson is quite excited about Faculty X, apparently considering thetheory both ingenious and revolutionary. It is neither.Need we describe the narrative tone? The history of occultism isevaluated in terms of you-know-what. Either it fits and is significant, or itdoesn’t and is uncouth. Wilson, for example, has a thing about the ancientEgyptians. He labels them “lazy and adverse to serious thinking”, citingAkhenaten’s monotheistic reign as “their only real intellectual achievement.Their science,” Wilson continues, “was almost nonexistent; theirmathematics remained crude.”Without diving merrily off the other side of the ship, we really thinkMr. Wilson is being a bit too arrogant, considering the Nile civilization’sremarkable achievements in architecture, linguistics, cartography,geometry, applied physics, medicine, and astronomy. Furthermore,Wilson’s grand assertion that the three millennia before the birth of Christwere an “evolutionary disappointment” strikes us as nothing short ofasinine.848 I should have said “should display ...”. Since then I have learned a thingor two fromThomas Szasz. For an interesting treatment of this “do unto others - ?” theme,considerHoward Fast’s Spartacus - or see the equally excellent film starring KirkDouglas. [Arethe Romans or the gladiators the real Satanists?]- 961 -Having dismissed man’s first struggles upwards from savagery withsuch aristocratic disdain, Wilson proceeds to encounter a magnificentrevelation embodied in the same, silly accounts of “psychic science” thatclog the pages of Fate each month. These, together with certain obscurepostulates drawn from the occult fads of the past, constitute Wilson’s prooffor the existence of Faculty X.There is nothing really all that spectacular about Wilson’s argument;we have heard it all before under a host of other guises. And we havebecome accustomed to seeing the achievements of history’s greatphilosophers collectively explained according to an author’s pet theory.We will now state as simply as possible why we take issue with Wilson’sFaculty X theory:Faculty X - and, for that matter, the vast majority of traditionaloccultisms - presuppose that man as a material entity is somehowincomplete or deficient. The insinuation is that there must be somethingelse to man - an “essence” that is purely spiritual. This same traditionemphasizes a purpose to human existence that transcends mere feedingand fighting and, well, reproducing. We have a destiny; we are an electrace. There is a Great Truth that we must seek out and comprehend. Tosome it is God, and to others [such as Wilson] it is less distinct. But it isthere, damn it, and Faculty X proves it, and everyone ought to hop on thebandwagon so we can go after it! 849Maybe like Don Quixote after the windmill.The desire for a predestination of the human race is transcultural, andit is understandably very popular. But logically it is a fallacy, if the sheerweight of anthropological science counts for anything at all. Man is aproduct of normal biological evolution, both willful and accidental, and hisincreasing capacity for memory, logic, and comparison has nurtured thephenomenon of identity. And, since awareness of identity predated anunderstanding of its factors, man assumed a “soul” or a “true self” beyond849 A denunciation somewhat awkwardly and inaccurately conceived and worded,evenfrom the premises of the Age of Satan. My differences with Wilson were - and are- two.(1) He postulates that everyone partakes of Faculty X, i.e. that it is agenerallyapplicable feature of natural evolution. (2) He identifies it with man’sspiritualmetamorphosis towards union with the consciousness of a Universal godhead - aquasi-scientific restatement of the Rosicrucian/Cabalistic climb up the Tree of Life.I, on theother hand, am of the opinion that the Gift of Set is selective based uponmutualintellectual and intentional effort by individual humans and the Prince ofDarkness, andthat it is alien to, not harmonious with the natural universe. Hence it is not aproduct ofnatural evolution.- 962 -matter. Paradoxically, such a supposition actually does a disservice to manby undervaluing the sophistication of his mental machinery.Think about it. When we say that the Church of Satan advocates acarnal philosophy as opposed to a spiritual one, we aren’t justrecommending that everyone should become a glutton, a slob, and/or a sexmaniac. Satan embodies the realization that man is a chemical machine, anexceedingly-complex stimulus/response robot - and only then theassumption that, as an independent, ultranatural entity, his prerogativesare unlimited by outside intellect.The concept of preordained destiny is antithetical to Satanism, for aninevitable future, whether determined by a God or by a more impersonalforce, denies freedom of the will. Consequently any discipline that hingesupon destiny or purpose - such as precognition - is by definition unSatanic.In his concluding chapter, “Glimpses”, Wilson fields his most powerfulargument on behalf of Faculty X. It is merely the Gurdjieff/Ouspensky-derived notion that one’s sense of time is variable and occasionally subjectto control by the psyche. Our response is: So what else is new? Consciousmastery of the fourth dimension is simply the result of thinking eitherabnormally swiftly or abnormally slowly. Our standard time references areartificial yardsticks through which we compare our individual rates ofthought and movement; thus group coordination is made possible.Colin Wilson draws an instructive conclusion, but it is again aparaphrase of Ouspensky. He suggests that conscious exercise of ourpowers of concentration will enable the mind to become even morepowerful, hopefully to a victory of the spirit over matter.And Wilson’s eventual summation - that conscious exercise ofconcentration will inspire a further evolution in humanity - is alsoOuspensky-derived. Wilson, however, amends the idea to one of spiritvictory over matter. We would reply that, there being no “spirit”independent of matter, this hypothesis is nonsensical. And for him toconclude that the achievement of such a “Faculty X” would constitute apassport to “unity of life” and “total control” is overly grandiose. Expansionof the intellect presupposes rather an increase in human opportunity anddiversification. Control and unity would proclaim man God; variation andcontrast proclaim him Satan.And now, lest you think we have a thing about Colin Wilson, the Hoofwould like to recommend his novel The Mind Parasites most highly. Itdeals with much the same sort of transmentalism, but it is admittedlyspeculative. The book’s theme is strongly Lovecraftian, and since its release- 963 -about 3 or 4 years ago it has continued to win readers’ acclaim. The MindParasites is now appearing in hardcover courtesy of Arkham House.- 964 -- 965 -Appendix 46: “Darwin and the Devil”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-5, May/June VII/1972The processes of classification as practiced by the human mind areoften regarded as “natural” in the sense that environmental categories areassumed to be independent of their articulation by mankind. To a certainextent this may be true, at least in the chemical, physical, and mathematicalsciences. [One might well argue, however, that the absence of anappreciating intellect would make “classification” a meaningless concept.]The case of physical anthropology is somewhat different. For one thingit got off to a rather late start: For the better part of the last 2,000 yearsallinvestigations into our biological origins had to conform to the fantasticpronouncements of the “Book of Genesis”. Only since the relatively recentacceptance of Darwinian evolution have anthropologists been free toanalyze data on their own merits alone.One theist-derived concept, unfortunately, has persisted in spite ofDarwin. It is simply the assumption that our evolution was in no wayinterfered with - that we were the first and only creatures of intelligence towalk our planet. Most anthropological texts suggest that we are descendedfrom a species of primate or quasi-primate that, in order to survive,gradually developed an oversize brain to compensate for physical weakness.This same pre-human eventually switched from a herbivore to a carnivore,thus making it less dependent upon the seasonal changes.This theory is reasonable enough, but there are two main defects in it.First, many of its supporting criteria, such as the definitive stages of man’ssupposed mutations, are so hypothetical as to approach speculation. One ortwo skull fragments, a piece of thigh-bone, or a fossilized hand-printcasting are too often the sole bases for a pronounced link in the chain.The second complication is that evidence exists that our evolutionarydevelopment was influenced by unnatural means. We should emphasizethat we are talking not about little green men in flying saucers, but aboutarchæological data in the scientific sense. Let us elaborate:Our earliest evidence of man dates to about 1 million years ago. InSouth Africa a large number of fossil remains of mutated apes has beenfound. Classified as Australopithecines, these pre-men possess human-likehip and thigh bones in addition to enlarged cranial capacities of between400cc and 600cc. Conventional theories of evolution can substantiate thecontinued mutation of this man-ape [or his contemporaries] to the stage of- 966 -Pithecanthropus Erectus - a skull fragment found in Java with an estimatedcapacity of about 900cc. Later versions of Pithecanthropus have evidencedskulls of up to 1,100cc. And here we encounter the enigma of the “missinglink”.The Java remains date to the early Lower-Paleolithic period - about800,000 years ago. The next two definitive ancestors of modern man, Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal, did not appear until the Middle-Paleolithicperiod - about 100,000 years ago. There is some question, then, about theinterim 700,000 years. Nor, might it be added, is this the only “missinglink” period.Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal, who were approximate contemporaries,possessed cranial capacities respectively of up to 1,700cc and 1,500cc. Howand why did these startling enlargements occur? And why was Cro-Magnon’s cranium in particular larger than that of present-day man, whoaverages 1,400cc?The “missing link” has accordingly been sought with understandableimpatience. African Genesis and similar late works continue to narrow thegap. But as we see it, the question “how” is of secondary import to thequestion “why”.Why brain evolution? Why are we mental mutants instead of physicalones? Other enduring species have managed to survive on the basis ofbodily strength. But man continues to grow less muscular as he depends toan increasing degree on his intellectual powers.The author of this intellect we have chosen to identify as Satan. Such“God” as exists is merely a mathematical consistency, and the impudentconsciousness of man defies the law of consistency by its very presence.Versions of the actual inspiration of unnatural intelligence have beenoffered by every civilized era including our own. The Hebrew serpent andthe Greek Prometheus have given way to a surrealistic monolith in themotion picture 2001 or, even more ironically, to an alien “Devil” namedKarellen in Childhood’s End.But cast aside the symbolisms and consider the proposition on a factualbasis. To proceed, we may search in the most ancient remains of civilizedman …Contrary to what is generally assumed, there are many cultures whichpredate Egypt and China. The most famous legend, of course, is that ofAtlantis, and the inquisitor regularly encounters such alternatives asChurchward’s Mu, Tolkien’s Numenor, the Toltecs’ Aztlan, and the tales ofGondwara, Punt, and Thule/Hyperborea.- 967 -And, sooner or later, the Satanist is bound to encounter those verydisturbing writings of H.P. Lovecraft. The influence of the Cthulhu Mythosis strong in the Church of Satan, and this is not only because HPL tells aconvincing horror story. Of particular note is the recurring contention that3-dimensional space travel was not the medium of the Dæmonic gift.Relativity was not fully appreciated in Lovecraft’s day; thus its emphasis inthe Mythos is intriguing. But again to history:2,600 years ago Ashurbanipal, King of the Assyrian Empire, advised hisministers that immense cities of a vanished race existed in the wastes of theArabian Desert. He claimed to possess many mysterious records of theruined cities in his libraries. Recent excavations in Nineveh have brought tolight hundreds of tablets wrought with mathematical tabulations andpowers of progression, seemingly of a random nature. Recurring constantlyis the famous Pythagorean Theorem, an interesting discovery in view of itsnow-supposed Egyptian origin. Expeditions into Lebanon have unearthedgigantic stone quarries, one containing a block of stone weighing over 4million pounds. Even today, transport of such a stone would be quiteimpossible.- Compare this to The Nameless City and The Shadow Out of Time.The Pyramids of Egypt are generally placed to about 2000 BCE, butinscriptions within several of the lesser monuments indicate that they wereconstructed at a time when Lyra was in Cancer. This would be 70,000 yearsearlier. There are no remains of smoke within newly-uncovered passagesinside the monuments; what light-source was used in construction … orwas there a light-source? Statues and records shown by the Priests of Uastto Herodotus led the great historian to conclude that their order dated back11,000 years before his time. Funeral inscriptions in the Satanic era of theEgyptian Empire (the XIX and XX Dynasties) take a strange andfrightening turn, depicting monstrous, half-human, half-animal figurescompletely alien to the usual representations of the Khemite pantheon.- You are referred to Imprisoned with the Pharaohs and The Haunterof the Dark …In the Bolivian Andes, on a 13,000-foot plateau, are the ruins of atitanic city of almost indefinite age [geological strata estimates date back toPaleolithic times]. This city, known as Chucara or Tiahuanaco, is reputed tobe the only surface remains of an underground network of caverns andpassageways; and the ruins themselves contain tremendous arches anddoorways, Olympian statues of gaping-mouthed figures with four-fingered,webbed hands, and inscriptions depicting an undersea existence by- 968 -superhuman races with blue-tinted skins. Included on the Gate of the Sun[a casting is on display at the Museum of Man, Paris] is a 225-day Venusiancalendar, and it is worthy of note that an increase of CO2 in the blood -which would be effected on Venus or at high altitudes - imparts a bluishtinge to the complexion. Many of the principal Egyptian gods are depictedwith blue skins, and Egyptian ceremonial artists, where color wasconcerned, were strict realists. Plato, in his Timæus and Critias, identifiedblue as the color of the Atlantean Priesthood.- Consider At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow OverInnsmouth, and references to the Plateau of Leng.More may not be said at this time. You should know, however, that theChurch of Satan will tell you little of a direct nature. You will be led to manystrange and unusual fountains, but you alone must decide whether or not todrink.YANKEE ROSE- 969 -Appendix 47: Satanic Wedding Ceremony- by Anton Szandor LaVeyThe ceremony is opened according to the basic sequence in the SatanicBible. Following the Opening of the Gate, the bride and groom comeforward.Priest:In the name of the all-powerful manifestation of Satan I greetye this night of nights. These walls are become a chamberwherein the fruition of this courtship might be recognized. Eachof you, in your own fashion, hath bestowed the wizardry ofenchantment upon the other and, having done so, desires asolemnization of this prowess. Think not lightly upon thyaccomplishment, for honest desire which craveth lastingdevotion is not always fulfilled. By the strength of your love andthe substance of your selves, you have commenced unto thisunion. As each creature upon the Earth seeketh completion, soyour halves are now made whole. May the creatures of theEarth join with us this night and sing praises wherever life andlove abound.Priestess: I ask you, [name of groom], is this your choice of woman, madewith all the thought and desire of your being, and cast withinthe likeness of your dreams?Groom:[Response: A simple affirmative or a longer personalstatement.]Priestess: I ask you, [name of bride], is this your choice of man, madewith all the thought and desire of your being, and cast withinthe likeness of your dreams?Bride:[Response. May be a simple affirmative or a longer personalstatement.]Priest:Let the ring be placed.As lovers and as mates you stand before me, then, and by yourintentions you have cast your vows. I therefore solemnize this- 970 -union in the name of the Lord of the Earth, whose Priest I am,and in Satan’s ineffable name I proclaim you husband and wife.May all the joys of the world be yours, and may your love growstronger with each passing day. Embrace and be as one. [Asthey do so, Priest recites the Second Enochian Key.]The ceremony is closed according to the basic sequence in the SatanicBible.- 971 -Appendix 48: Grotto Administration Manual (Extracts)- by Michael A. Aquino III°III. Concept of the Satanic GrottoThe Satanic Grotto is unique from an organizational standpoint. It hasvery little in common with traditional church congregations, Whitewitchcraft covens, or fraternal lodges. A Grotto is not intended to be a socialinterest club, nor is it consistently structured from one locale to another.Only in one respect are all Grottos identical: Each is entrusted to theguardianship of a Grotto Leader chartered as such by the Central Grotto.For a discussion of the specific powers and responsibilities of the GrottoLeader, see Chapter V.Most individuals join the Church of Satan as members-at-large; as suchthey are not initially affiliated with a local Grotto. Membership-at-largedoes not automatically entitle one to membership in a local Grotto, even ifone presently exists in the new member’s community. Membershipstandards for local Grottos are determined by their respective Councils, andeach member of the Grotto possesses the power of veto where theadmission of a new member is concerned. The reason for this is that eachmember of the Church of Satan is entitled to maximum protection of hisanonymity. Inasmuch as members of a local Grotto are more liable toexposure than members-at-large, they are given the right to select theirimmediate associates. The Grotto Leader may overrule such a veto, but hemay not induct the aspirant until he has received confirmation of hisdecision by the Central Grotto.The point should be made that one need not join or establish a Grottoin order to become a magician of the Left-Hand Path. The individual maybe quite satisfied to work alone, or to cooperate informally with one ormore known members. The demands of one’s profession, family life, ordisposition may make continued membership-at-large the preferred option.Many persons, however, find that they are best able to realize theirdesires for power and manipulative influence through the medium of aformal organization. A Grotto is able to pursue projects on a scale whichwould be prohibitive to most individuals. Certain operations of ceremonialBlack Magic - as discussed in the Satanic Bible - require meticulouspreparation and integrated reinforcement for maximum impact.Furthermore the active and aggressive impression of Satanic Will upon agiven environment normally requires the coordinated and cohesive efforts- 972 -of an officially-constituted Grotto. The factors of Balance and Timingshould be considered in this respect.There is no prescribed level of activity that a Grotto is required tomaintain. It may choose to meet weekly, monthly, or at the call of theGrotto Leader. Its programs may emphasize philosophy, communityinfluence, and/or ceremonial magic. Satan is not so insecure a personage asto require scheduled adoration by his human disciples; he would rather seeyour efforts devoted to your personal education and advancement. Suchrituals as the Grotto conducts should evidence the membership’s consciousdesire to commune with the Powers of Darkness. Tribute for its own sake ismeaningless.Each local Grotto is entitled to act in the name of the Church of Satan;the member-at-large is not. This is a very real advantage to the Grotto, butit entails corresponding responsibilities as well: The honor of the Prince ofDarkness and that of his Church must be upheld to the limit of the Grotto’slegal ability. Let there be no misconception in this regard. There are norestrictions upon such Black Magical measures as you may choose toemploy, but public antagonism or misunderstanding must be answeredpromptly in a manner befitting the dignity and nobility of the Church.Finally, remember that the Church of Satan is organized not for mereself-perpetuation - but to educate and inspire its members to their eventualdivinity through mastery of the Powers of Darkness. This is, in every senseof the term, the Great Work, and no degradation of this purpose will becountenanced. Individuals who see the occult sciences as amusement orrecreation are advised to look elsewhere; often a traditional Whitewitchcraft coven or occult society would be appropriate. Seekers afterfraternal altruism or social comradeship should consider those very worthyassociations deliberately organized with such goals in mind. The Church ofSatan is answerable not to its membership or hierarchy - but to its Patron.IV. Formation of a GrottoAll members who desire to organize a Grotto and assume office asGrotto Leader must first qualify for the II° of the Church. No exceptions tothis rule are permitted, as the individual’s performance on the II°examination enables the Central Grotto to estimate his chances of successin this venture - and to provide additional aid or instruction if necessary.In the event there are other registered members-at-large in your area,the Regional Agent or the Central Grotto will provide you with their names- 973 -and addresses. Such a list is to be used for no other purpose than to contactthem concerning possible formation of a local Grotto. It will then be yourresponsibility to arrange for an organizational meeting.A minimum of 5 Active Members is required for the Central Grotto toissue a local Grotto charter. If there are not this many members in yourvicinity at the present time, you should direct your efforts towards inspiringqualified persons to join the Church as members-at-large. You may decideto do this informally, through word-of-mouth, or you may elect to make aformal presentation of the Satanic philosophy in an open forum. Aneighboring college or university campus is frequently ideal for such anapproach, as there are many speaking programs which would welcome theaddition of a knowledgeable Black Magician. A discussion of magical theoryfrom an academic or historical standpoint - with incidental references tothe Church and its contemporary policies - will probably attract a pilotgroup of interested individuals.One word of warning: Before ascending the rostrum, ascertain that youhave your facts straight and that you possess a greater-than-averagefamiliarity with your subject material. A bit of advance calculation willenable you to estimate what sort of questions you will most likelyencounter. Don’t be hesitant to admit your areas of ignorance; if you knewall the answers, you’d be entitled to the V°, not the II°!You might consider publicizing the potential Grotto. Such an approachhas many advantages, and it permits the organizer to maintain hisanonymity as well. A mimeographed or spirit-duplicated notice, if carefullyexecuted and publicly posted [bookstores, markets, campuses, galleries,and forums are ideal], can attract a multitude of responses. You shouldavoid such controversial media as “underground” newspapers, however.Not only do we wish to circumnavigate the faddist elements, but we have astandard of dignity to preserve.Unless your background in the Black Arts is extensive, you should notattempt to convene a Grotto on the basis of doctrine to be taught, but ratheras a convenient means for cooperative exploration of the Satanic arts andsciences. It may be advantageous to begin with a limited group of only 4 or5 individuals. Later this initial group may be reconstituted as the firstCouncil of the new Grotto.Strictly formal meetings with complicated ceremonies are notrecommended during the organizing process. These usually requireextensive preparation, considerable knowledge of ritual methodology, andsuitable accessories [some of which involve major expense]. This is not to- 974 -say that you should avoid conducting rituals, but rather to suggest that youplan and execute them within your existing resources. There are manyreasons why it may not prove possible to form a Grotto in a given location,and you should not assume financial burdens until you are assured of areturn.You might do well to begin with informal, individual-check dinners anddiscussions, either at a private residence or around the table of a goodrestaurant. Remember that ours is a religion of pleasure and indulgence,and that a Grotto is not a revolutionary party cell! Each gathering should beprovocative and entertaining, and serious Satanism will follow as a matterof course if those present are sincere in their interest. From this beginningit is but a short step to a program of ritual, discussion, and social activitiesencompassing the next several months.You should keep the Regional Agent or the Central Grotto informed ofyour progress or lack of it. If you experience a certain difficulty, the chancesare that it has been encountered before, so don’t hesitate to write forspecific advice. The best way to fulfill this requirement is to keep a typedrecord of your plans and activities, sending copies to your Regional Agentor Central Grotto contact. This, by the way, is the first step towardspublishing a local newsletter - which will be discussed in Chapter XI.When you consider your group to be firmly grounded in theoretical andpractical Satanism, and truly deserving of a Grotto charter, you may submitsuch a request to the Council of Nine through the Central Grotto. TheCouncil will review all available data and determine whether you arecapable of representing the Church at the local level.Upon favorable consideration of your application, a charter will be sentto you. If it is decided not to charter the Grotto at this time, an explanationof the underlying rationale will be communicated. Charters are reissued onan annual basis, or whenever there is a change in the Grotto Leadership.The document identifies both the Grotto Leader and the Grotto itself. Ifever in doubt concerning the authenticity of an unfamiliar Grotto, requestto see the charter. This is your right as a member of the Church of Satan.V. Grotto Administrative StructureThe Grotto Leader is the presiding officer of the local Grotto. He ispersonally responsible to the Central Grotto for the behavior of his Grotto.He must hold at least the II° of the Church to qualify for his position, but hemay aspire to the III° - the Priesthood of Mendes - as a prerogative of his- 975 -office. Authorization as a Grotto Leader, however, does not automaticallyentitle the incumbent to the Priesthood.There are specific differences between the leadership responsibilities ofthe II° and III° Grotto Leaders. These may be explained as follows:The II° Grotto Leader is not a member of the Satanic hierarchy. He isunder no obligation to the Central Grotto to involve himself in Churchmatters beyond the normal concerns of his Grotto. He may remaincompletely anonymous and clandestine in his role, and his name is notrecorded as an official of the Church. Thus II° Grotto Leadership isfrequently ideal for individuals who wish to administer Grottos withminimum risk of public exposure.The III° Grotto Leader is ordained to the Priesthood of Mendes. Assuch he is a member of the Church hierarchy, and he is responsible to itsauthority and the Powers represented by such authority. He is expected todefend the interests of the Church in matters both public and private. Hemay act personally in the name of the Church of Satan, and he may bedirected to assume responsibilities above and beyond those of immediateconcern to the Grotto.Only the constituents of his own Grotto are expected to follow thedirectives of a II° Grotto Leader. The instructions of a Priest of Mendes areto be honored by all I° and II° members of the Church of Satan.It should be noted that, regardless of his degree, the chartered GrottoLeader bears sole responsibility for the Grotto. If his authority seemsextensive, it is because he assumes extensive liabilities as well.Each Grotto Leader reserves the right to appoint a Grotto Council toassist him in his office. He may delegate specific authorities to Councilmembers, but he may not delegate his personal responsibility in each case.Accordingly he is not bound by recommendations of the Council; it is anadvisory body only. Thus it parallels on a local scale the design of theCouncil of Nine, which serves in cabinet capacity to the High Priest.Grotto Council members are individually selected by the Grotto Leader.Some of their identities may be known only to him, while others may beknown to the entire Grotto. They may serve in designated offices - such assecretary, treasurer, editor, historian, ceremonial director, master-at-arms,etc. - or they may serve without portfolio. The size and composition of theentire Council will vary with the needs and activities of each Grotto. Councilmeetings are normally closed to the general membership, but individualmembers may attend upon invitation.- 976 -A Grotto is an autocracy, not a democracy, so there is no need for aconstitution or by-laws. Nor, indeed, is the Council empowered to ratifysuch documents. The policies and procedures of a Grotto are decided by theGrotto Leader with the advice of the Council, and the written code of suchdictates is known as the Grotto Protocol. It is the usual practice to acquainteach aspiring member with the Protocol, in order that he may understandthe guiding principles of that Grotto prior to obligating himself. Additionsto the Protocol are generally printed in the Grotto newsletter if one ispublished. All articles of Protocol should be communicated to the CentralGrotto as they are instituted.VI. Membership ProceduresThe authority to confer or withdraw membership in the Church ofSatan rests with the Central Grotto alone. This authority is not delegated toeither regional or local organizations.Prior to the chartering of a Grotto, individuals may requestmembership information directly from the Central Grotto. The fee forinitial membership is $25. In the case of the member-at-large, the entiresum is deposited in the accounts of the Central Grotto. Following theapproval of his questionnaire, the new member is sent his identificationcard and introductory packet. If his application should not be approved, thefee is refunded.Persons who wish to join the Church through one of its local Grottosmust contact the Grotto Leader or secretary for a copy of the questionnaire.The completed form is returned to the local Council for review, and theGrotto Leader must sign his approval to it before forwarding it to theCentral Grotto. Under these circumstances the new member’s materials willbe returned to the Grotto Leader, who may present them at the formalinduction. When an individual joins through a chartered Grotto, $10 fromhis membership fee is returned by the Central Grotto to the local GrottoLeader for the accounts of that Grotto.Membership questionnaires are available upon request from theSecretary of the Central Grotto, and each local Grotto is advised to keep agood supply on hand. Applicants should be instructed to type or print theirresponses in ink, as an illegible questionnaire is liable to be rejected forthatreason alone.Arbitrary cancellation of membership may be recommended by theGrotto Leader for any number of reasons, and he should submit all- 977 -pertinent information in writing to the Council of Nine. He need notconsult the Grotto Council in such an instance, but it is recommended thatall disciplinary or punitive measures initiated at the local level be subjectedto the deliberative influence of the Council before a final recommendationis made.According to the Protocol of the Central Grotto, no member of theChurch of Satan may discuss matters relative to the Church with a personwhose membership has been arbitrarily terminated. Cancellation ofmembership is approved for only the most serious offenses, and allSatanists should regard an expelled member accordingly.Once inducted, an individual is considered a member for life unless hismembership is terminated either voluntarily or for punitive reasons. Everymember of the Church of Satan is free to resign his affiliation withimpunity, as long as he subsequently remains mute concerning the Churchand the Powers at its command.VII. Plans and OperationsAs was indicated in Chapter III, there is no requirement that a localGrotto adhere to a specified program of activities. The frequency of eventsconducted by each Grotto is determined by its size, environment, interests,and capabilities. Some Grottos will emphasize scholastics and academicpursuits, while others may incline towards ceremonial magic in the bestGothic traditions. As long as such programs are in keeping with the basictenets of Satanic philosophy as outlined in the Satanic Bible, the CentralGrotto has no desire to provide more than the most general guidance.It is important to note that no individual - whether a member or anonmember of the Church - may ever be compelled to attend a function ofthe Church against his wishes. There are no exceptions to this policy.Instructions concerning the theory and practice of Satanic rituals andceremonies may be found in the Satanic Bible. As long as the properintroductory and concluding steps are observed, rituals may varyextensively as to content and purpose. The Central Grotto is continuingresearch towards the publishing of a selection of Church rituals, but thecomposition of all rituals is limited only by the imagination. It is oftenhelpful to consult texts dealing with Black Magical texts of a historicalnature. The Church reading list contains many such volumes.Some Grottos conduct classes and seminars on occult subjects whichare open to the public on a paying basis. In addition to serving as an- 978 -excellent public relations device, such sessions provide a good source ofincome to the treasury. Speaking engagements may be contracted at localinstitutions on either a paying or a gratuitous basis. Encounters of this typeare frequently most interesting to speaker and audience alike. You shouldnot attempt lectures on a large scale, of course, until you have spokeninformally to a number of smaller groups. Public speaking technique, likeanything else, requires experience as well as a knowledge of the principlesinvolved.Editing and publishing a Grotto newsletter or literary review can proveextremely worthwhile, particularly in a Grotto that meets infrequently orthat is dispersed over a large geographic area. This idea is discussed ingreater detail in Chapter XI.It is perhaps appropriate to mention the standards of decorum that allGrottos are expected to observe. It is neither anticipated nor required that aGrotto will conduct all of its activities in formal or semiformal attire.Personal conduct and standards of dress should suit the occasion. Butremember that the behavior and appearance of the membership reflectupon the image of the entire Church. If we would presume to be the leadersof society, we must present a corresponding impression.This point also applies to the Grotto’s headquarters and meetingfacilities. First impressions are often the lasting ones. You will attract theelitist elements only if they are convinced that the Grotto is elite as well.And remember that visiting journalists or members of other religions whoenter your chambers will not always be looking for facts favorable to theChurch of Satan. The cause we champion is a noble one, and it must neverbe tarnished through superficial carelessness.VIII. Ceremonial MagicThe theory and practice of ceremonial Black Magic is what finallydistinguishes the Church of Satan from the usual academic, social,fraternal, or professional society - and, for that matter, from otherchurches. No member should ever lose sight of this fact. The policy of theCentral Grotto is that all rituals of the Church are restricted to Active,registered members only. No rituals or Church functions are ever to beopen to the public at large. We are an elitist organization, and we have noresponsibility whatsoever to the masses.- 979 -Because of the traditional reputation of Satanism, there are a numberof responsible individuals who may hesitate to join the Church because theydo not know that the ritual practices of the Grotto are in fact ethical. TheGrotto Leader may, at his discretion, permit such individuals to view amaximum of one ritual. This ritual may not be one which deals withdestruction, conferring of membership or degrees, or the Order of theTrapezoid. Before permitting such a visit, the Grotto Leader shouldascertain that the prospective member intends to join once his concernsover ritual ethics are satisfied. Only two visitors are allowed at any oneritual - and only for this reason.Rituals may be classified as operative (i.e. designed to accomplish anobjective end) or illustrative (designed to express an emotion, explore aconcept, or instruct the participants and observers). Sample topics foroperative rituals might include compassion, lust, love, confusion, control,and destruction; while illustrative approaches might be taken towards suchconcepts as pleasure, pain, will, sight, sound, life, death, time, space, and/or combinations of these. And an excellent way to educate novice membersin the techniques of Black Magic is to encourage them to design andprepare such rituals for performance by the entire Grotto.It is not necessary that the Grotto Leader personally preside at eachand every ritual. He or his designated representative - who must besanctioned for this purpose by the Central Grotto - must be present,however. No Grotto ritual may be scheduled or conducted without theGrotto Leader’s prior knowledge and consent.In preparing rituals you are encouraged to explore source materialsfrom as many cultures and time periods as possible, for illustrative andoperative ceremonies alike. In addition to the Satanic Bible and the Churchreading list, you should consider the anthropological, historical, andmythological sections of the public library or its campus counterpart; hereyou may frequently find a wealth of magical information that is invariablyoverlooked by the ignorant. It is not necessary to invest in a large numberof “occult” texts, as it is more than likely that you will discover the balanceof such publications to be simplistic and superstitious in nature. If youattempt to evoke an Infernal presence with a counting-rhyme more suitedto the nursery, you will receive only a mocking silence for your efforts. Weare in league with Forces far more complex than man, and juveniletheatrics are not the key to their counsel.There are ways to misuse Black Magic. The ceremonies of thetheological churches - although of the White category - are ineffective- 980 -because they are, in the final analysis, “plays” that are conducted to impressan audience. The celebrants are usually more concerned with the image and“message” they present to the onlookers than with the substance of theritual itself. This is not the case with the ceremonial practices of the Churchof Satan. At such times as you presume to invoke or evoke either the Princeof Darkness or one of the Forces under his mastery, then let there be nodoubt of your sincerity. Error or arrogance in this regard has beenresponsible for the ruin or destruction of many a magician, and you areadmonished accordingly.IX. FinanceGenerally speaking, it is necessary to be realistic concerning financialmatters. No Grotto Leader should be expected to support the Grotto’sactivities from his personal resources alone. It is the responsibility of theGrotto Council to institute and maintain a financial base for the Grotto’soperations. A Grotto may function with only a minimal budget, but itcannot function without one. As soon as possible after receiving its charter,each Grotto should formalize its financial transactions through the use of achecking account. In order to open such an account, the Grotto Leadermust make prior written application to the Secretary of the Central Grotto.This application must include the name and address of the desired bank,and the name and qualifications of a nominee for the office of Grottotreasurer. Upon approval of the application the Central Grotto will send aletter of authorization to the bank, with copy to the Grotto Leader, who maythen open the account. The account will be in the name of “Church of Satan,[ ] Grotto”, and two signatures - those of the Grotto Leader and the Grottotreasurer - must be required to validate each check. The account must be sodesigned that the signature of the Central Grotto Secretary is required tovalidate any check for over $25.The Grotto treasurer must send the Secretary of the Central Grotto amonthly financial statement postmarked not later than the 1st of eachmonth. The Grotto should be prepared at all times to display its accounts toaccredited (letter of authorization) regional or Central Grottorepresentatives. Local Grottos may not charge a membership induction feeabove and beyond that required for membership-at-large. One of theincluded benefits of general membership in the Church of Satan is the rightto participate in the activities of a local Grotto. This does not preclude the- 981 -right of the Grotto Leader to expel a member from his Grotto for reasons ofmisconduct, however.The Grotto may charge a set fee to members and nonmembers forparticipation in its activities. The fee should always be announced inadvance of the activity in question, and it may not exceed $2 for membersand $4 for nonmembers. The only exceptions to this maximum rate areHalloween and Walpurgisnacht, when the charge may suit the lavishness ofthe occasion. Outright donations may be accepted but never solicited. Ifsuch donations are made by check, they should be marked payable to thelocal Grotto by name, not just to the Church of Satan. It is not theresponsibility of the Central Grotto to account to the tax authorities forfunds given to local Grottos. A receipt should be issued for each outrightdonation. It is a good idea to issue receipts for all income transactions, asthis ensures that the Grotto’s books are always kept up to date. Fees may becharged for appearances at community institutions or events, for guestlectures, or for magical assistance rendered. Satanists are not expected tobe good Samaritans. But you should consider free talks to high schoolclasses, small civic clubs, etc. as part of your public relationsresponsibilities.If the Grotto possesses its own duplicating equipment, the printing ofposters, notices, or letters for private individuals may serve as anothermeans of income. Local Grottos may not reproduce or distribute anyinformation on the Church of Satan to the public without the authorizationof the Central Grotto, however. Under no circumstances may a Grottocontract financial debt. The Central Grotto will not assume liability in suchcases.It should be remembered that a Grotto charter may be suspended orrevoked for a number of reasons - not all of them punitive. For example, theCouncil of Nine may decide to inactivate a certain Grotto temporarily orpermanently in order to ensure the safety of its members. The reasons forsuch decisions are often not revealed to the local membership ifconfidential sources of information are involved. Hence a Grotto must beprepared at all times to terminate its activities and financial accounts atshort notice.X. Public RelationsThe public image of the Church of Satan is measurably strengthened bysecrecy. Local Grottos should take full advantage of the mystery principle:- 982 -If you do not feel that it is to your advantage to answer a certain questionconcerning your motives, plans, or activities, simply remain silent.This should not, however, be interpreted as a license to remain mute inthe face of an attack. The Satanist should speak the last word in anyexchange, and he should assume an aggressive stance whenever possible.Instead of justifying his actions, in other words, he should question thoseof his critic. Most individuals who attack the Church of Satan do so becausethey are openly or secretly afraid of it. Do not forget this. Any person whopresumes to denounce the Powers of Darkness has merely acted to ensurehis eventual destruction by these same Forces.Complete silence, of course, will result in the Grotto’s remainingunknown to the public. This may be necessary in some areas, but it will alsocause the membership to expand at a very slow rate. No responsible personwill join an organization - particularly one as “sinister” as the Church ofSatan - about which he knows absolutely nothing. You may safeguard yourprivacy, but also be prepared to explain your ethics to sincerely interestedindividuals. This is particularly important with regard to our policiesconcerning sex, animal sacrifice, drugs, parental consent, and legalintegrity.The Church of Satan is surrounded by self-proclaimed “Satanists” andwould-be witches. It is of the greatest importance that the activities andillegal doctrines of such elements be exposed and categorically disclaimedby true Satanists. This may be done anonymously or under an assumedname, but it must be done. Details of all such encounters should bepromptly reported to the Central Grotto in order that appropriate actionmay be taken at the national level.The Black Magician must be coldly realistic. There are manyindividuals and organizations with a very material interest in thedestruction or discrediting of the Church of Satan. The existing churches ofthe world have climbed to their present positions of social influence notthrough kindness and charity, but through ruthless suppression ofcompetition. It would be naive to expect such parasites to sit idly by whilethe Church of Satan engineers their demise. Never underestimate youradversary!Religious toleration exists by historical necessity, not as a consequenceof clerical liberalism. The Church of Satan enjoys the protection of the FirstAmendment to the United States Constitution, but most major theologiesare supranational in doctrine, and incorporate an implicit disregard forsecular governments. They have challenged them before, and they would- 983 -not hesitate to do so again if sufficiently provoked. Do not allow eitheryourself or your Grotto to become the unwilling tool of such elements. Ifyou suspect that you are under scrutiny or attack by one or more suchagencies, notify the Central Grotto immediately.The Church of Satan is recognized as a legitimate religious body underthe laws of the United States and the State of California. No member of theChurch may consider his affiliation as license to transgress the laws of hiscommunity, state, or nation. Such respect is justly due this country inreturn for its statutory sanction of our institutional existence. Violation ofthis guidance constitutes grounds for summary termination of membershipand further action as determined by the Council of Nine.XI. PublicationsAt the earliest possible opportunity each Grotto should secure a meansof reproducing written or printed material. While the ideal arrangementwould be for the Grotto to acquire and operate its own mimeograph, spiritduplicator, or copying machine, newly formed groups with limited financialresources may find commercial mimeographing or photo-offset servicesmore practical. Perhaps a Grotto member will have access to a machine thatcan be used.Publication of a local Grotto newsletter is unsurpassed as a device fortransmitting information to the membership. A newsletter also serves as arecord of the Grotto’s past activities and plans. Consequently it is anexcellent medium for notifying other Grottos, regional officials, and theCentral Grotto of your progress. Each issue of a local Grotto newsletter isrequired to contain the following notice: “The opinions expressed in thispublication are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily representthe official doctrines or policies of the Central Grotto, Church of Satan.”If you wish to send copies of the newsletter to other Grottos besidesyour own, you must delay the mailing of such copies for 7 days. A copy ofeach issue should be sent immediately to the Central Grotto. The delayperiod will permit the Central Grotto to notify the local editor if the issuecontains information that might be misunderstood if circulated beyond thelocal level. Newsletters may be published weekly, bimonthly, monthly, or asnecessary. Every effort should be made to maintain high standards ofcomposition, typography, and appearance. Proofreading is a must, as eventhe most experienced editor or typist is inclined to overlook his own errors.- 984 -The newsletter may be edited by either the Grotto Leader or an editorresponsible to him. Published material might include essays on practical,theoretical, or ritual magic; literary reviews or commentaries; articles onfilms or recordings; letters from members and nonmembers; regional ornational news items; inspirational quotations from famous Satanists;Grotto events; community events of interest to the membership; poems;instructions; Grotto Council meeting minutes or decisions; social notes;and even classified ads! Make the paper work for you, and its publicationwill become an expedient, not a burden.There are many other publications which may be developed to supportthe Grotto. Of considerable value is an informational pamphlet or brochurewhich explains the Grotto and the Church [in a limited way] to the public.Many outside inquiries can be dealt with simply by sending such a brochurein return. Policy statements - such as those concerning ethical standards -are far more effective when committed to print than when merely spokenaloud. Classes, activities, and speaking engagements can be publicized byposters and pamphlets. Publication and distribution of a local Grottocalendar listing activities over the next several months will serve toencourage maximum participation.Pamphlets, brochures, and informational letters need not contain theaforementioned Central Grotto disclaimer. All such items, however, mustbe approved by either a Priest or the Central Grotto Secretary before theyare distributed.For detailed guidance concerning the preparation and publishing ofyour newsletter or supporting materials, you are welcome to contact eitherthe nearest Regional Agent or the Editor of the Cloven Hoof.- 985 -Appendix 49: The Celebration of Death- by Michael A.

Aquino IV°[Seal]Order of the TrapezoidChurch of SatanFebruary 16, VIITo whom it may concern:On the 10th of February VII the Stygian Grotto of the Church of Satanwas officially dissolved, and four of its members were excommunicatedfrom the Church. The reasons for this action are admittedly complex, butthose persons who have been directly associated with the Stygian Grottodeserve an explanation of this seemingly abrupt development.During the past several years the Council has become increasinglyaware of an internal paradox in the design of the Church. Intended toadvocate the greatest possible expression of the personality, the Church hasoccasionally sponsored exactly the opposite effect due to the institutionalnecessity to gain social tolerance. In an environment of popular mistrust ofSatanism - due to the criminal actions of certain self-pronounced“Satanists” and the dementia of the White witchcraft movement - theChurch of Satan has found it necessary to place the strictest possibleemphasis on the personal behavior of its members. It has been pointed out- and justly so - that such repression is often contrary to the ideal of theSatanic philosophy. Consequently, after close consultation with the HighPriest, the Council has decided that it is time to draw a distinction betweentheoretical Satanism and Church affiliation. This will be discussed in detailin the March Cloven Hoof, but it may be paraphrased as follows:A theoretical or practicing Satanist is a person who endorses thephilosophy of Satanism as discussed in the Satanic Bible. It is not necessaryfor him to hold membership in the Church itself, and his freedom of actionis accordingly unrestricted.But a member of the Church, by the act of his formal association, willfind it necessary to observe certain behavioral restrictions in order that theChurch - the vehicle for the protection and preservation of Satanism - mayfunction with efficiency.In the case of Stygian, it has become increasingly obvious that thestrain between personal freedom and institutional demands was becomingparticularly acute. There have been accusations and counter-accusations- 996 -among the membership. Bitterness and not fellowship has been the result,and the happiness of many members, instead of being enhanced by theirmembership, has suffered. Much of this was no fault of the Grotto Leaderhimself, as the pressures of the paradox were simply beyond his control.Similar situations have arisen in other Grottos from time to time. In short,a “vicious circle” of personality conflict existed, and there was no reason toexpect that the situation would improve of its own volition. Accordingly theCouncil decided to act for the benefit of each member involved.The Stygian Grotto has been terminated as being premature for theclimate of Dayton and Centerville. At such time as the members in that areademonstrate that they are ready to find a real pleasure in formalassociation, the charter may be reinstated. Until then an informalassociation - on a personal basis - is thought best. As for those individualswhose membership was arbitrarily terminated, they were singled out fromthe membership as being those whose freedom of action was the mostseriously impaired by affiliation with the Church. Such an injustice to themcannot be sustained by the Black Order.The decision to terminate their membership was thus taken in the bestinterests of those members, and not for punitive reasons. All of them - andthe Grotto Leader in particular - have made their loyalty and integrity quiteclear, and thus speculation on the matter is completely unwarranted.Members of the Church are welcome to associate with them as they mightwith any other nonmembers who have not been excommunicated forpunitive reasons. They have performed many services for the Church ofSatan, and the Black Order does not forget those who have tried in theirown way to further the causes of Satanism. If their personal circumstanceschange with time, it is entirely possible that they might return to formalassociation with the Church.Remember this: Satanism is an attitude, and not something that can becreated by the mere issue of a membership card. Some will function best inan organizational environment, but others would be stifled under the sameconditions. Among the Council’s tasks is the identification of suchdifferences - to the betterment of each and every man and woman whowould stand with the Powers of Darkness.FOR THE COUNCIL OF NINE:John M. KincaidPriest of Mendes III°Minister of InformationAttest: Michael A. Aquino IV°- 997 -Appendix 53: Anton Szandor LaVey Interview- from Black Magic, Satanism, and Voodoo by Leo Louis Martello(New York: HC Publishers, Inc., 1972)Martello: Since in the popular mind Satanism is usually used as asynonym for evil, do you consider yourself such? If not, why not?LaVey: The popular mind has never displayed an overabundance ofobjectivity. The popular mind accepts most data with little or no question,unless it happens to hurt. Then it is rejected. By blaming everything “bad”on the Christian concept of the Devil, theologians had a ready scapegoat forwhatever went against their best interests. I don’t blame them; they neededa Devil in order to operate. I’m afraid we’re not that kind of Devil, though.The word “Satan”, which is Hebrew in origin, means the accuser, theadversary, the prosecutor. We question all things that defy logic,although we recognize the importance of subjectivity when the security ofthe “popular mind” is at stake.Insofar as my “evil” propensities are concerned, I find thecompanionship of little children or animals far more inspirational andrejuvenating than the most esoteric magical ceremony and hold them ingreat reverence. I love good food, hearty drink, music that can bring shiversto my spine or tears to my eyes, works of art that are finely wrought andinteresting to gaze upon, sexual fulfillment in accord with the imagery andsensations I find stimulating, a comfortable bed in which to sleep, whatevermaterial possessions I can find the time to enjoy, a body free from pain, andothers with whom to share these things who love and respect me as I dothem.I feel that those who thrive on misery should be presented with copiousamounts of woe. Those who need doomsdays should be given direprophecies. Those who would like to see you as miserable as themselvesshould be exiled with their own kind. I believe that water should beallowed to seek its own level, without interference, insofar as humanbeings are concerned. I believe in the glorification of the ego. That is a goodseparation process. A pumped-up, over inflated ego will display a fool’sflaws quickly and put him out of the running, while the worthy will rise tomeet the added responsibilities that will accompany their exaltation.I believe that man is not created equal, and that there are 25-wattpeople as well as 250-watt people, regardless of ethnic, economic, or- 998 -religious backgrounds. If these things make me “evil”, then I must pleadguilty.Martello: What do you think are the basic differences betweenyourself and those who call themselves “white witches”?LaVey: Honesty, some degree of intelligence, and courage.Martello: What differentiates you and your Church of Satan fromothers who are labeled “Satanists” by the press?LaVey: The press’ first obligation is to sell papers - then report thenews. This does not mean to imply, however, that the journalists who writeof Satanism know the facts but instead choose to write what will sell best.Most writings about Satanism are written by people whose emotionalsurvival is every bit as dependent upon cherished lies as their readers’.Martello: Since Satanism is apt to attract crackpots of all kinds, doyou have a method of weeding them out? And if so, can you elaborate?LaVey: Yes, although crackpots will be found on all roads to acollective identity, whether it be bowling or a sports car club. The elementof the forbidden and the thrill at being perverse is bound to appeal to manysound persons - as well as the first class “mad nut”. When we receive arequest for admission to the Church of Satan, the applicant is sent aquestionnaire which is filled out and mailed with a photograph and theapplication fee to our San Francisco address. Upon satisfactory review ofthe applicant’s qualifications, a “first release” is given, and the applicant issent the name and address of his contact, who, upon finding the applicantacceptable, proceeds to place him in touch with the proper people.Assuming the applicant is assigned to a Grotto for participation in rituals,he is further observed as to conduct and stability before being allowed toproceed.One of the most important factors of acceptability is one’s present levelof achievement in the outside world. If one is a creep and expects to enterthe Church as a VIP simply because he knows the names of all the demonsand can recite the grimoires, he will be sadly disillusioned. I’m afraid we’renot very democratic either, for a person who holds no qualified executiverole or position of responsibility in everyday life cannot expect to attain a- 999 -new peer level and receive a fancy title upon joining us. What one is insidethe Church of Satan depends on what one is outside the Church of Satan.Naturally there is a deterrent for many would-be Satanic “Masters”, as wellas “High Priestesses” of the witchcraft “rap session” variety.Martello: Do you consider it paradoxical that you are completely openin your Church of Satan while most witchcraft covens are secretive? Do yousee any significance in this?LaVey: It is only by being open that we attract and filter in those whorepresent the cream of the crop. Also the question must be answered byanother: Why should we not be open? We are doing nothing illegal,unconstitutional, or harmful to a sound society. We feel that the philosophyof the Church of Satan has a great appeal to many who are qualified toenrich their lives through it. Why shouldn’t they, as social animals, be giventhe opportunity to share their views with others of the same persuasion?As far as the study and practice of Satanic magic are concerned, beyonda reasonable point we are a secret society. The outer socio-philosophicallevel of Church activities is like the tip of an iceberg. There are circleswithin circles in our Order, and those who think that they can “find outwhat it’s all about” simply by joining for a couple of months will come awaywith information commensurate with their own superficiality. Severalrather dimwitted journalists of the current crop of “witchcraft researchers”have fallen victim to this type of mystical myopia.As far as I’m concerned, the reason most witchcraft covens are sosecretive is fear. In most instances the fear is founded on a sound base, butnot because of actual persecution at the hands of bigots. It is the kind offear that comes from knowing that no matter how big a power binge youcan be on with the coven, you can’t cut it outside that peer group. Webelieve that a person must first be a successful magician in the outsideworld before he can stand before a group of witches and warlocks andprofess any degree of ability. The measure of a witch’s prowess is to be ableto succeed in spite of her beliefs as well as because of her beliefs. Most“white” witchcraft practitioners lack the self-confidence necessary to comeout into the open. They are frightened, inadequate wretches. If theyweren’t, they wouldn’t have to stress the prefix “white”.- 1000 -Martello: Most devil-worshippers and so-called Satanists are reallyreverse or perverse Judæo-Christians. Does this apply to you? If not, whynot?LaVey: What’s wrong if most Satanists are perverse Christians? Afterall, it was Christianity that perverted pagan beliefs. Every time a Christianengages in religious observances, he is performing a Black Mass in thetruest sense, i.e. he is participating in a rite which is, down to its veryimplements, a mockery, a parody of once-established sacred ceremonies. Inthis regard the Satanist’s blasphemies are no worse than the Christians’.Perversion, like good and evil, is relative. To a tribesman who goesabout in a loincloth, a tuxedo would be a perversity. There are manySatanists who have no quarrel with Christianity, recognizing it as merely anobsolete but once-necessary means to control masses of people who,without the kind of fear engendered by such a religion, would be harder tocontrol. This is an aspect of Satanism I could discuss for hours, had I thetime.I suppose I’m as much a pervert as the next Satanist when it comes totaking delight in violating sacred cows whose only right to existence reposesin their popularity. If Satanism were a fad and everyone flocked to it, I haveno doubt that I would soon question the sincerity of many who wouldappear on the scene as “longtime Satanists”. Most people are perfectlywilling to be “perverse” when it is fashionable, as is proven by today’s socialclimate. At least the perverse Satanist has directed his perversity towardsan ideal target! Ideally one takes up Satanism out of logic rather thandesperation; hence there is little chance that a person who has failedmiserably in all his undertakings will suddenly find success after makinghis “pact” with the Devil.Martello: As you know, I totally reject the terms “white” and “black”as synonyms for good and evil. However, in your view, what is yourdefinition of “good” and of “evil”?LaVey: “Good” is what makes me feel good. “Evil” is what makes mefeel bad. Obviously there are others who would not share the measure of myfeelings. Therefore I must gauge my actions to the best interests of thosewho inhabit the environment around me. There is nothing one can do thatwill not be “evil” to something or somebody else. By breathing we kill- 1001 -certain germs; this is “evil” to the germs! Maybe we should all stopbreathing so we will be “good”?Martello: Though I’m not a Satanist, I’ve never considered you athreat, though I disagree philosophically on many points. However, many“white witches” seem to go into psychic somersaults at the mention of yourname. Do you have any views on the reason why?LaVey: Of course they feel threatened - and well they should! Irepresent a threat to every hypocrite, do-gooder, psychic vampire, sobsister, and champion of mediocrity, and I’m proud of it!My ego is not solely dependent upon that which has been gainedthrough arcane and esoteric delvings. I have and can do things as a pridefulhuman being, not simply as a mystic or witch. I have played Kreuzer on theviolin, worked eight Nubian lions and four Bengal tigers in a single cage,had my drawings and paintings exhibited in major galleries, received myblack belt when Judo was limited to World War II movies, played the oboewith top symphonic musicians, done first architectural renderings forexisting housing developments, developed workable methods of hypnosisand brain-wave control that the “experts” are just now “discovering” - andmore.I have earned medals for marksmanship (both pistol and rifle), and Imanage a Bach fugue on a Baroque organ with the same ease as a Rombergscore on the Mighty Wurlitzer. I have driven pitons in the rock faces ofmountains and have learned to wield the epee and sabre. I have takenaward-winning salon photographs of children and pets, and have recordedthe most brutal examples of man’s viciousness while working as acriminologist. I have studied long and traveled far in pursuit of what Iconsider to be the real Magic - and have found it!If you do not consider me a threat, perhaps it is because you recognizethe demons of Pride and Selfishness within yourself and are not terrified oftheir presence. Let others prattle of their assorted “crafts”, each in his orher own miasmic state of self-righteousness. I am a Satanist, and other thanthe laws of my environment, mine is the Law of the Jungle. Perhaps thoseinsecure “white” witches need to worry. To quote from my own Bible:“Thrice cursed are they whose insecurity makes them vile, for they shallserve and suffer!”Incidentally, you say you disagree philosophically on many points. Areyou sure you don’t mean you find the Satanic philosophy disagreeable on- 1002 -many points? I must admit that I do, and wish it could be other than it is,but a Satanist must be the ultimate realist. Reality is often disagreeable.Everything in the philosophy of Satanism is based on the way things are.We all have our own ideas on how things ought to be. Before any positivechange can come about in man’s conduct, he must own up to the existenceof the very things he has tried to sweep under the carpet, and clean his ownhouse first. Satanism can be viewed as complete reality, once therepugnance to its etymologically correct nomenclature has been overcome.To disagree with the philosophy of Satanism is like disagreeing with havingtwo eyes, two ears, one nose, and a mouth.Martello: A Gardnerian spokesman has said that homosexuality andwitchcraft are a contradiction in terms. Some Traditionalists say that itdoesn’t matter one way or another. What is the LaVey view on this?LaVey: To state that homosexuality and witchcraft are a contradictionin terms is asinine. Inasmuch as sexual energy plays an important part inceremonial magic, the ability to become aroused is what counts, not howone becomes aroused. If others of the same sex are a warlock’s predilection,then the imagery presented by young men will cause the libido to uncoil. Icall a male practitioner a “warlock” because the term “witch”, as applied toa man, tends to cast added aspersions on an already misunderstoodpractice. Witches and warlocks have enough trouble explaining themselveswithout adding the stigma of the male nurse to their problems!Martello: What is your attitude towards drugs?LaVey: I assume you refer to socially controversial and illegal drugs.Drugs are great for the slaves but no good for the Masters. The gloriesattained through a drug experience are no more valid than the meaninglessbaubles with which the status-seeking drone surrounds himself. Thedifference lies in that a drug trip is cheaper and less work to obtain than asplit-level ranch home, two cars, and a big color TV.Those who eulogize on unfoldment gained through drugs haveobviously been insensitive to such awareness-provoking stimuli ascomplete sexual fulfillment, beautiful music, inspirational literature, etc.The excuse that certain drugs are a necessary adjunct to the practice ofmagic is quite lame. Drugs may be employed, however, to provide or- 1003 -develop an unswerving belief in magic - in fact an unswerving belief in justabout anything!I can condone the use of certain drugs for easing the last stages of aterminal illness where intense pain is present. Perhaps those who needdrugs are suffering from a sort of terminal illness where constant andintense pain is present - but of a different sort. I consider drug abuse apolite alternative to suicide. Perhaps one day euthanasia will be madeattractive enough, and the drug problem will be solved.Martello: What are your future goals?LaVey: I cannot openly state them for magical reasons.- 1004 -- 1005 -Appendix 54: Extracts from“The Occult: A Substitute Faith”Time, June 19, 1972It is Saturday night. A young Army officer and his wife welcome a smallgroup of people to their comfortable split-level home, which stands amidthe tidy landscaping of a housing development in Louisville. The guests -most of them dressed neatly in sports clothes - include a computerprogrammer, a store clerk, a dog trainer, and a psychology major from thenearby University of Louisville. They all troop downstairs to a vinyl-flooredrecreation room.Is this a bridge party? A committee meeting for a charity drive? Hardly.The hour is midnight. On the front door of the house is an orange emblemshowing black pitchforks. 850 Downstairs the party is gathered solemnlybefore a black-draped altar. Facing them, on the wall, is a chartreuse goat-image superimposed on a purple pentagram. “Tonight there is one amongus elect to the Priesthood of Mendes,” intones one of the men. “Satan, thouhast seen fit to charge Warlock Shai with thy Priesthood on Earth ... thedeification of the human race.” Reciting an ordination rite first in Latin andthen in English851 , the speaker taps a second man on each shoulder with asword. Someone pours flash powder on the sterno altar flame and whoosh!Fire leaps toward the ceiling.Satanism. “Blessed are the strong, for they shall possess the Earth. Ifa man smite you on one cheek, smash him on the other!” This invertedgospel - from Anton Szandor LaVey’s Satanic Bible - sets the tone fortoday’s leading brand of Satanism, the San Francisco-based Church ofSatan. Founded in 1966 by LaVey, a former circus animal trainer, theChurch of Satan offers a mirror image of most of the beliefs and ethics oftraditional Christianity.LaVey’s church and its branches might well be called the “unitarian”wing of the occult. The members invest themselves with some of the mostflamboyant trappings of occultism, but magic for them is mostlypsychodrama - or plain old carnival hokum. They invoke Satan not as asupernatural being, but as a symbol of man’s self-gratifying ego, which is850 The Protection Amulet of the Church of Satan: 4 black tridents in the shapeof a crossagainst a red circular background, holding at bay 4 small white rectangles.851 In Enochian and English!- 1006 -what they really worship. They look down on those who actually believe inthe supernatural, evil or otherwise.LaVey’s church is organized, incorporated, and protected under thelaws of California. LaVey, 42, stopped giving out membership figures whenhis followers, who are grouped in local “grottos”, reached a total of 10,000.The most striking thing about the members of the Church of Satan is thatinstead of being exotic, they are almost banal in their normality. Their mostinsidious contribution to evil is their resolute commitment to man’s animalnature, stripped of any spiritual dimension or thought of self-sacrifice.There is no reach, in Browning’s terms - only grasp. Under the guise ofeschewing hypocrisy, they actively pursue the materialistic values of theaffluent society - without any twinge of conscience to suggest there mightbe something more.They jockey for upward mobility in the five degrees of Churchmembership, which closely resemble those in witchcraft covens:Apprentice, Warlock (or Witch), Wizard (or Enchantress), Sorcerer (orSorceress), and Magus - the degree that LaVey holds. The ruling Council ofNine, which LaVey heads, makes appointments to various ranks on thebasis not only of the candidate’s proficiency in Satanist doctrine but also his“dining preferences”, the “style of decor” in his home, and the “make, year,and condition” of his automobile.The Army officer who celebrated the recent ordination in Louisville is afourth-degree Satanist Priest, a member of the Council of Nine, and editorof LaVey’s “confidential” newsletter, the Cloven Hoof. He is also the authorof a widely used R.O.T.C. textbook. Other LaVey Satanists include a MarineCorps N.C.O. from North Carolina and, in New Jersey’s Lilith Grotto, a realestate broker and an insurance executive. Beyond such devotees, LaVey’ssinister balderdash reaches hundreds of thousands more through the blackgospel of the Satanic Bible and his second book, the Compleat Witch, inwhich his advice reaches the downright sordid.- 1007 -Appendix 55: “Time is on Our Side, Sort Of”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-6, July/August VII/1972You walked into the neighborhood drug store and Zing! There was theJune 19th edition of Time with a fashionably attired852 Satanist gracing thecover. In addition to four more photographs853 and illustrations fromnational and local branches of the Church of Satan, we received fairlyextensive coverage in the written text of the article “The Occult: ASubstitute Faith”.As with many other items of publicity concerning the Church,members’ comments on the Time article have run from delight to dismay.And so the Hoof thought some comments of its own might be in order:Our members must bear in mind that, by definition, Satanism is a slapin the face to conventionalism and stasis. If the Church ever reaches thepoint where it is accepted without controversy by the mainstream ofsociety, it will have lost the very essence of its Infernal mandate. Satanism,in a social context, is an impulse against the norm of existing morality - aforce born not of ideology, but of a desire for raw change. Hegel analyzedSatanism; we actualize it.Time is not in a position to print stories exactly as reporters may seethem - not even as editors may see them. Time - together with every otherform of news media - must play to its audience and consumer interestgroups. Insofar as the audience will accept it, the news will be portrayedobjectively. But the editorial departments are forced to temper truth withcredibility. If too radical a position is taken, one of two things will happen:Either the magazine, newspaper, or station will come in for sharp criticism,or it will be ignored in favor [ironically enough] of more “sensible” media.The most obvious example of media dependence upon consumerdesire, of course, has been the war in southeast Asia. What the massesdesire to hear, they will hear - or they will go somewhere else to hear it.We who know a great deal about the true nature of the Church of Satansometimes forget that, to the average outsider, we can look pretty terrifying.852 Black robe and masked hood.853 (1) Anton LaVey in horned cowl and with sword, surrounded by Central Grottoassistants wearing large animal heads from the Tierdrama. (2) Lilith Sinclairpresidingat a Lilith Grotto ritual. (3) Karla LaVey resting her hands atop a human skull.(4) TheSigil of Baphomet.- 1008 -To the man on the street, the term “Satanism” still brings to mind thingslike cannibalism, ritual murder, necrophilia, hard drugs, and sexual sadism.If he has read anything about it, it was probably Dennis Wheatley’s TheDevil Rides Out. [Remember that we are talking about those who are notoccult enthusiasts.]For such a person to open Time and read that the worldwide Church ofSatan is actually a pretty sharp organization would be quite unthinkable. Itwould be too vast an intellectual bite for him to take, so to speak. Manyyears of psychological conditioning are not reversed in 5 minutes’ reading,no matter how reputable the source may be.Representatives from Time visited 3 group activities of the Church -one in Louisville, one in the New York City area, and one at the CentralGrotto. In each locale questions were both asked and answered withcandor. No ambiguous answers were given to reasonable inquiries. As far asthe Black Order’s senior representative in each area was concerned, Timeleft the scene with a very detailed picture of the Church and its policies.For the most part this came through in print. Our posture as an ethicalorganization was established, certainly, as well as the quality and integrityof our membership. The only concessions to the norm were (a) anincomplete and thus rather cavalier description of the qualifications for thePriesthood of Mendes, and (b) use of the terms “sordid” and “balderdash”with reference to the Satanic Bible and Compleat Witch. Such overt valuejudgments have their place on the editorial page, certainly, but they areunnecessary for factual news coverage.As to the qualifications for the Priesthood, Time was provided with thefull set of criteria that appeared in the Cloven Hoof a few issues ago. Tosuggest that our Priests and Priestesses are ordained primarily on the basisof their automobiles, residential decor, and dining habits is rather a grossdistortion. Such things are indeed taken into consideration in the case ofeach applicant for the III°, but as personality indicators and not as“requirements” per se. We rather doubt that Time failed to discern this inthe course of several hours’ discussion.- 1009 -Nevertheless the article was a long way from being the “more stuffedrats and tombstones” that had been half-suspected. 854 It was a step acrossthe Rubicon for the Church, inasmuch as it was ultimately granted thatSatanism was more of a philosophy than a fad. For this Time deserves to becommended, as it was a definite stand in defiance of a very strong norm inthe United States - one which maintains that Satanism must be eitherquasi-criminal or quasi-lunatic.Insofar as White Witchcraft was concerned, the most crushing thing wecan say is that Time treated it very objectively. Frankly we have yet to meeta devotee of the Right-Hand Path who isn’t (a) nude, (b) a slob, and/or (c)nuts. Many of them are very nice people in spite of this, but there you haveit.We had the feeling that Time got a little confused over the distinctionbetween Satanism and Wicca. Maybe they talked to Leo. 855 Well, anyway,here we go again: Wicca/the Craft/White Witchcraft is basically aregression to primitive nature worship, usually polytheistic. The objects ofworship vary with individual groups, but they generally include the GreatMother or Goddess and the Horned God [usually as an inferior consort].These figures are overtly worshipped, prayed to, and venerated asanthropomorphic personalities. The White Witches exist for their glory andbenefit.Satanism, on the other hand, rejects existing forms of theism andmaterialism. The first is held to be factually invalid, the second to be ego-repressive. Satanism is designed as a balance between the two wherebyman may pursue practical ends, yet unleash his ambition and imaginationto their greatest possible extent. It is a religion of fantasy with an affirmedbase in reality.Thus we are not merely the Scrooges and Marleys that Time seemed tosuggest. If Satanism strikes some as vicious and cruel, it is because thephilosophy is designed for survival in a world that is itself vicious andcruel. Yet the Satanist has less motivation than the theist to initiate orpromote these qualities, for he recognizes their existing proliferation in854 “I just got word through the grapevine - very hush-hush right now, so thecompetition won’t come out with the same story - that Time is to come out with abigstory on the occult movement, which will include [big deal] a part on the C/S.So lookforward to another few paragraphs of stuffed rat & tombstone coverage, withmaybe abit of ‘dangerous Devil-worshippers’ thrown in for good-guy measure. Ain’t wegot fun?”- Letter, Diane LaVey to M.A. Aquino, March 22, 1972.855 Martello.- 1010 -many forms which may be acceptable to the theist. If Wicca is a regressionto primitive paganism, then Satanism is a progression to the next stage ofmetaphysical evolution - to which we refer as the Satanic Age.All in all, Time, you did a fairly good job. It could have been better, butthen it could also have been a great deal worse … which is exactly what wesay to ourselves each time a new issue of the Hoof comes out!- 1011 -Appendix 56: “Witchcraft”- by Lana EllisCourier-Journal & Times Magazine, Louisville, Kentucky, July 9, 1972In a quiet suburban neighborhood, a former Boy Scout who is now arespectable businessman raises a sword and calls for Satan to come forthfrom Hell. In an old house near the downtown business area, a group ofmen and women, their nude bodies forming a circle, chants incantationsfirst spoken many centuries before Christ. What they’re practicing iswitchcraft. The city is Louisville, but the same scenes are repeated inDetroit, Kansas City, Dayton, San Francisco, Indianapolis, St. Petersburg,and other cities.Evangelist Billy Graham has said that the current popularity ofwitchcraft is proof God is alive. He sees the Devil worshippers as Lucifer’slieutenants in a last, futile battle to defeat the Prince of Heaven. But thedemonic ranks continue to grow. The Church of Satan, the San Francisco-based religion whose people practice “black witchcraft”, claims that 10,000Americans carry its red membership cards. “White witches” claim at leastthat many members in the States, triple that number in England, and anastounding 60,000 in France.“Louisville is a center for the occult in the midwest,” said the youngman who conducts the weekly witchcraft class at the Free University held atthe University of Louisville. 856 “Modern life has gotten to so many people.They feel confused, left out. Witchcraft is an escape from complexities.” Hesaid that Louisville has a key role in the Church of Satan because a Magisterand a Priestess live here, and: “There’s been a Grotto (congregation) inIndianapolis since the second year (1967).” 857Librarians in Louisville reported recently that books on witchcraft arein great demand.University of Kentucky associate professor Donald Nugent, 858 who haspublished many articles dealing with the history and current renaissance of856 Cliff Amos, whose class sponsored the M.A.A. lecture at the University ofLouisvillewhich led to the founding of the Nineveh Grotto. Amos became one of the foundingmembers of the Grotto, later Grotto Leader, later expelled by the time he wasinterviewed for this article.857 Not true. There was one member in Indianapolis, Joseph Daniels.858 Given an interview by M.A.A. in Louisville, but rebuffed in an attempt togain a 6114interview because of pushiness on his part.- 1012 -witchcraft, said he began to see the signs of the revival of witchcraft fiveyears ago, and has been speaking at seminars on the subject for the lastthree years. “The Bluegrass is a fertile area for witchcraft. Cincinnati too.Students at the University of Kentucky have organized covens, and severalyears ago a witchcraft convention was held in Paris, Ky.” He believeswitchcraft is promoted by some hard-rock groups, citing song and albumtitles such as “Sympathy for the Devil” and “His Satanic Majesty”.In comparing witches of olden days to today’s breed, Prof. Nugent said,“The Renaissance witches were probably older. In Essex the accusedaveraged between 50 and 70; today a leading witch reports that the averageage in his covens is 28. This could suggest greater sexual activity now.Drugs were commonplace to both.”Witchcraft worshippers are divided into two major groups. The“whites” are pantheist while the “blacks” worship Satan and his fellowdemons. [There is no racial connotation to either term.]The “white” religion, called Wicca, referred to as “the craft”, is as old asthe cave culture, its followers believe. “People who remained isolated keptto the worship of horned gods,” said a Louisville white witch. “The godshave very pronounced breasts and genitals, prehistoric sex pots. Manybelieve that the craft had its heyday in ancient Greece. Today the movementhas sexual connotations that are really a handicap.“From 500 to 700 AD the Christians got a foothold in Europe andmoved in on the witches. They took the pagan temples and converted themto church buildings. They took pagan holidays and made them Christianones. Their Yule was our Solstice. Holly, mistletoe, and the Yule log are alltraditions that belonged to the craft religion. Holly is a fertility symbol, andmistletoe is a narcotic used in rituals. It became hard for witchcraft tocontinue during the period of persecutions. Children ceased to be initiatedbecause they talked too freely, so the religion stopped being passed fromgeneration to generation.”Probably the most influential white witch in this century was the lateGerald Brouseau Gardner of England. His books gave leadership, and hiswitchcraft museum, situated in an old mill on the Isle of Man, became amecca for white witches. Gardner died in 1964, and other witches haveemerged as leaders. Louise Huebner casts spells at west coast rallies,appears on radio and television and casts horoscopes, and Sybil Leek, anEnglish woman, claims, via reincarnation, to be more than 500 years old -an extreme claim for any woman.- 1013 -Anton Szandor LaVey of San Francisco is to black witchcraft whatGerald Gardner was to white. Although his leadership doesn’t include allblack witches, he heads the Church of Satan, the largest of the black groups.Called “the black pope” by many of his followers, LaVey was formerlysecond oboeist in the San Francisco Ballet Symphony Orchestra, a liontamer with the Clyde Beatty Circus, a hypnotist, a photographer for the SanFrancisco Police Department, and an organist in a topless bar. 859 The birthof the Church of Satan took place on April 30, 1966, an evening known asWalpurgisnacht, the most important festival in the lore of magic andwitchcraft. At that time, LaVey shaved his head and donned a clerical collarto wear with the black demonic robes.In addition to the Satanic Bible, published in 1969 and considered theguidebook for the would-be Satanist, LaVey recently wrote the CompleatWitch, subtitled “What to do when Virtue Fails”. Advising on subjects suchas “how to charm a married man”, “sex maniac without sanctimony”,“secrets of indecent exposure”, and “taking advantage of men who thinkthey’re taking advantage of you”, LaVey aimed for a best seller and wasgiving in to the best of the Satanic virtues - greed. The Satanic Bible,published in paperback form only, is a best seller on many collegecampuses.The Church of Satan claims members in Canada, England, Australia,Germany, France, Italy, Holland, and Vietnam as well as the United States.Membership figures for Louisville are kept secret, but the local Magistersaid his flock is as large as the normal congregation of a regular church.“We have a college-centered Grotto here - many from the University ofLouisville.” He placed the average age of the members at 23.The Louisville Magister described the Church of Satan as an elite, cadretype of organization. “It’s not designed to attract the average or below-average person. We like to collect those we think are the social leaders orpotential ones.”To become a member, one has to be at least 18 years old and pay amembership fee of $25. On this first level of the Church, a member isallowed to wear a red Baphomet, the ancient symbol of Satan, a trapezoidalemblem drawn on a circular disk and worn on a neck chain. 860 He alsoreceives the Church’s newsletter, the Cloven Hoof. 90% of the Church’smembership falls into this category.859 The Lost Weekend Nightclub was not topless.860 Ellis is mistakenly describing the Council of Nine medallion I showed her.- 1014 -After demonstrating proficiency in Satanism, a member can take aspecial examination and be elevated to the second degree - Warlock formen, Witch for women.The third degree is the Priesthood of Mendes, named for a city inancient Egypt where diabolism was practiced.At the fourth level, one becomes either a Magister Caverni, MagisterTempli, or Magister Magnus - ranks roughly comparable to bishop,archbishop, and cardinal.The fifth degree, one achieved only by LaVey, is that of MagisterSatanas or Satanic Master. This recognition of skill can only be awarded byLaVey and the Council of Nine, an anonymous advisory group within theChurch.To be excommunicated from the Church of Satan, a member mustendanger the reputation of the Church and the members.Excommunication is done by the Council of Nine upon therecommendation of a Grotto Leader, Priest, or member with evidence. “Noone is thrown out unless he’s been warned, and then it’s with good reason,”said the Magister.Joining the white witch group is even more difficult. There’s a longwaiting period, usually six months to a year. Wicca makes no attempt toseek members, no fees are charged, and there is no national organization.Men and women alike are referred to as witches, the term “warlock” neverbeing used. Upon initiation, the new witch assumes a new name,symbolizing that he has become another person. Each witch carries anathame, a knife with symbols on it. Initiation is the first degree. After atleast a year and a day, a witch can advance to the second degree by provingworth. The third degree brings the rank of high priest or priestess.White witches worship in a group called a coven, usually composed of13 people. With an emphasis on fertility, witches worship together in male-female couples. The 13th member of the coven is the high priest orpriestess. The meeting house is referred to as the covenstead.The beliefs of the “blacks” of the Church of Satan were formulated byLaVey, who discusses the background in his book, the Satanic Bible. Hefeels that religion must deal with carnal desire and the flesh in a logical,rational manner or lose the struggle, not only for men’s bodies but also fortheir souls. “Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!” hedeclares. “Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of lovewasted on ingrates. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the othercheek. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams.”- 1015 -The Church of Satan takes the seven deadly sins - greed, pride, envy,anger, gluttony, lust, and sloth - and allows their indulgence. LaVey writes:“Blessed are the powerful, for they shall be reverenced among men - Cursedare the feeble, for they shall be blotted out! Blessed are the bold, for theyshall be masters of the world - Cursed are the righteously humble, for theyshall be trodden under cloven hoofs!”To the believers, Satanism is self-deification: “Human beings havesomething unpredictable in them, and we call that element Satan. Satan isman raised to his infinite potential, man as a god.” Then there is theSatanists’ definition of Hell: “You’re in it; Hell is life, right now,” theysay.“We say that Satan is the lord of the world. Heaven’s supposed to be a placewhere you have no problems. Hell is where you have hideous problems butyou enjoy working them out. We don’t concern ourselves with whathappens after death.“If there really is a Hell after life, we’ll be down there stabbing all thehypocritical Christians.”But when a white witch dies, he is expected to go to a place known asthe Summerland. There he waits until he is reborn and is incarnated into afuture time. Witches also believe there is retribution in the present life, andthat anything a person does is returned to him threefold. When engaging ina “curse ritual”, they take great care that the evil they wish upon someoneelse won’t be returned to them in triplicate.The Merlin type of ceremonial magic has no part in the religiousservices practiced by Gardnerian white witches. Nor is superstition believedin. “The number 13 is like any other number, but walking under a ladder isa practical thing to avoid,” a Louisville white witch said. “The ‘knock onwood’ idea is a historical one, originating from the Druids, who worshippedin the woods and knocked on trees to get the attention of spirits dwellingthere.” A 9’ worship area, called the “magick circle”, is where the rituals areperformed. The witches worship naked (they call it “skyclad”) in order tocast off signs of worldliness and to be closer to nature.Among the “black” Satanists there are 3 types of ceremony: a sex ritual,commonly known as a love charm or spell; a compassion or sentimentritual, performed for the purpose of helping others or oneself; and adestruction ritual, commonly known as a hex or curse.Probably the most publicized part of Satanism is the Black Mass, withinverted rituals that exalt the Devil. When the Church of Satan first began,reports of nude women and sexual activities during the mass werewidespread, but Louisville Satanists say they have limited their blasphemy- 1016 -to stamping on a sesame seed wafer that’s supposed to symbolize the hostused in Christian communion. “The mass used to be very dirty, very lewd,”said the Priestess. “Now it’s just a way one can release inhibitions.” Thechamber has an altar where a nude woman may be placed to represent theearth mother. Ritual items can include candles, a bell, a chalice, a swordsymbolizing power, a phallic symbol representing generation, virility, andaggression, a gong, and parchment.“Anyone who is a Satanist has no doubts about his virility,” said theLouisville Magister. “In other religions there’s either excessive indulgencein sex or abstinence to prove oneself. The Satanic Church maintains thatsex isn’t so crucial that you have to allow your life to depend upon yourresponse to it.”“I don’t think there’s an undue emphasis on sex,” said the Priestess.“Dr. LaVey feels that human beings need sex as much as food, but hedoesn’t regard it as the original sin or as a no-no. Nor does this mean thatDr. LaVey sleeps with every Witch in his Grotto; he doesn’t. He and his wifehave a true and genuine love.”Marriage between a Satanist and a member of another church isallowed. Sacrifice, whether involving animals or humans, is against theteachings of the Church.Members of the occult movements aren’t recognizable as witches.Two of the highest-ranking members of the Church of Satan, a Magisterand a Priestess, are a young married couple who live in a Louisvillesubdivision described in a newspaper ad as providing “quiet, respectableliving”. The basement of their attractive, ranch-style home houses the ritualchamber where Satanists meet to call upon the power of the Devil. Yet thesecrecy of the movement is such that the neighbors don’t know about it.“My husband and I look like Mr. and Mrs. America,” says the Priestess.She’s strikingly attractive, her face a study of peaches and creamnaturalness. Her clothing, a camel-colored pantsuit one day, quilted hostessskirt the next, enhances her neat appearance. Only the Baphomets theywear around their necks and her Priestess ring bearing the head of the Goatof Mendes identify them as Satanists. Her husband, a Magister Caverni, atitle equivalent to bishop, is tall, slim, and wears his hair at proper length.They both have Bachelor of Arts degrees, he in Political Science from theUniversity of California, she in Nursing from Brigham Young. They havetwo small children, a boy and a girl, and a large Irish Setter. He’s the son ofa Roman Catholic father and a Swedenborgian mother, and went to a- 1017 -Lutheran Sunday school as a boy. She was reared a Mormon and at onetime took Roman Catholic instruction.“I think the word is getting around the country that our Church is avery ethical organization,” said the Magister. “We don’t make crazystatements, and we try to keep the nut element out. I just hope it gets to thepoint where we won’t have to worry about our people’s safety. When mywife and I first came to Louisville, we flipped a coin to decide whether weshould tell people. We were here for six months before it came out.”Although it’s not prohibited by their religion, the Priestess andMagister neither smoke nor drink. “And I’ve never been to a Church ofSatan function where anyone was either drunk or stoned,” said thePriestess. Last year Look magazine reported that the Louisville Grotto sentLaVey a bank check for the souls of six members. But the Priestessexplained that as a joke. “Our souls are our own,” she said. “… If we havesouls,” said the Magister.Although it caused some stir at the courthouse, the Magister hasreceived an ordination certificate and can perform marriages in JeffersonCounty. Each wedding he performs is perfectly legal and is always tailoredto the requests of the couple involved.- 1018 -- 1019 -Appendix 57: “Expedition to R’lyeh”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-6, July-August VII/1972Since the Cloven Hoof’s recent publication of the article “Darwin andthe Devil”, we have received a sizable number of inquiries on the subject ofH.P. Lovecraft’s historical authenticity. The Bolivian ruins of Tiahuanaco,as the possible basis for the Plateau of Leng, have elicited particularcomment. We’ll get back to Tiahuanaco in a bit, but first we thought youmight be interested in a quick trip to another Lovecraftian “creation” -R’lyeh.The key to Lovecraft’s literary figures - both animate and geographic -may be found in his passion for ancient history, classical mythology, andsubtle allusion. [Perhaps the most widely quoted example of the last is thename of “Klarkash-Ton” - an Atlantean priest named in honor of ClarkAshton Smith.] To a great extent it is the atmosphere of subconsciousauthenticity created by Lovecraft’s allusions that imparts a very materialterror to the works of the Cthulhu Mythos. And the fact that historicalallusion is markedly absent from the tales of Lovecraft’s mimics has apredictable influence on their impact. If you’ve ever wondered why theother authors of Mythos-tales failed to strike that certain chord in you,that’s why.And, it might be added, this is a distinction that seems to have eludedthe vast majority of Lovecraft’s biographers and critics - all of whom seemdisposed to classify the author as merely a good writer of horror fiction.After reading Lin Carter’s A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos, we foundourselves honestly wondering whether the commentary were inspired byadmiration or envy. For the moment this shall be a moot point.But we digress. Occasionally Lovecraft would not bother to disguise thename of a Mythos-locale. A good example of this is the city of Sarnath,subject of The Doom that Came to Sarnath. As any good Buddhist will tellyou, Sarnath is quite real. Its ruins are located in the Benares District ofIndia at Latitude 25°23’N, Longitude 83°2’E, and the site is a Buddhistlandmark. Included in the grounds is the famous “Deer Park”, whereBuddha is said to have preached the Four Noble Truths of his First Sermonin 528 BCE. Our latest estimates indicate that Sarnath was originallyconstructed sometime in the late 5th Century BCE, which means thatBuddha must have just squeaked in under the wire. The real Sarnath, in anycase, has a history as bleak as that of its Mythos counterpart. It was sacked- 1020 -and burned to the ground twice - once in 1026 CE and again in 1193. Themoral of the story is that Buddhism and Giant Water Lizard Worship arerisky religions around which to build cities.And now what about Lovecraft’s most famous metropolis - themysterious aquatic city of R’lyeh, located in the islands of the netherPacific? First described in The Call of Cthulhu, R’lyeh was to capture theimagination of readers like no other city in the Mythos. What and where isR’lyeh?Ironically enough, Lovecraft himself provided the single mostimportant clue in The Shadow Over Innsmouth. Included amongst thehaunts of the sea-captain Ahab Marsh was the island of Ponape - and thishappens to be a very real island. Our curiosity was aroused, and the firstthing that occurred to us was that we had heard the name beforesomewhere. Back to the library -Ah, yes: A. Merritt’s The Moon Pool. [Anybody in the audience whohasn’t heard of A. Merritt? Shame on you! Take H. Rider Haggard, add adash of Sax Rohmer minus the Great Yellow Peril element, and you haveMerritt.] The Moon Pool is a tale concerning an ethereal monster called theDweller, who periodically ventures out of the pool in question, locatedguess-where, to abduct the minds and/or bodies of innocent terrestrials.The hero, his sidekick, and the villain follow The Thing to an undergroundempire [shades of The Mountains of Madness] where they meet The Girland The Gods, etc.So we came to the conclusion that there was something a bit odd aboutPonape. We were right. The island houses the ruins of a stone city ofindeterminate age and extraordinarily unconventional aspect. At themoment it is called Nan-Madol, and it’s the sort of place only Cthulhu couldlove.Ponape, if you’d care to pinpoint it on a map, sits in the United StatesTrust Territory of Micronesia at Latitude 6°55’N, Longitude 158°25’E. Ifyou’ve mislaid your sextant, draw an imaginary line eastward from the topof Borneo. Then draw another one southward from the tip of theKamchatka Peninsula. Where those two lines intersect you will find ourisland.About 340 square miles in size, Ponape is surrounded by a barrier reefenclosing a lagoon. It is somewhat sparsely populated by Micronesiannatives, has 200 inches of rainfall per year, and includes the two present-day towns of Kolonia and Kapinga. Its two principal attractions are the- 1021 -gigantic Sokehs Rock (called the “Diamond Head of Micronesia”) and, ofcourse, R’lyeh.… Or the City of Metalanim, as it was known throughout the lastcentury. The equally enigmatic name of “Nan-Madol” - accorded the ruinsby modern natives - translates to “In Space”. No explanation is offered forthis odd title, other than that it has been handed down by tradition.Nan-Madol is occasionally referred to as the Venice of the Pacific, as itis constructed completely on over 50 artificial islets located on a site alongthe island’s southeastern shore. There are no roads per se - only a networkof canals interlacing the islets. These canals are fairly wide in some places,but they are as narrow as 10’ in others, making even canoe navigation atricky business. Including both islets and canals, the entire cityencompasses over 11 square miles.The individual islets’ foundations rest upon a coral reef. On these rudeplatforms are massively walled enclosures of basaltic rock-logs. The slabsthemselves vary from about 1x2’ to 8x10’ in size, and the standing wallsvary in height from 6’ to 20’. The walls of some islets are arranged in simplerectangles. Others comprise freakish, geometrical polygons with swelled orirregular sides, and some include interior vaults and chambers ofpolyhedronal design. Most of the ruins are in advanced stages of decay anddecomposition, but others have weathered the ages sufficiently well forinitial archæological investigation to be carried out. One such expedition,chartered by the Smithsonian Institution, has conducted preliminaryresearch in the city, but its findings have not yet been made available. Andthe surrounding mangrove jungle hasn’t helped; only about one block hasbeen successfully cleared of undergrowth. That’s what happens with 200annual inches of rain!The known city is devoid of conventional inscriptions or hieroglyphs,although certain curious decorations on the ruins have counterparts inother areas of the world. Most of the walls are so obviously irregular - with5-8 facets to each stone slab - that one suspects the builders felt noinclination towards conventional architecture.Surprisingly - or not so surprisingly - little is known about the origin ofthe stone city. A United States Trust Territory Physical Planning ProgramReport entitled “Ponape Island, Ponape District” suggests withoutelaboration that the structure was built in the 13th century CE by aSaudeleurs king named “Olo-sopha”. For a more detailed version of thislegend, however, one must turn to the natives.- 1022 -They themselves do not claim to be the descendants of the builders ofNan-Madol. To them the city is most certainly haunted. They venture thereonly with the greatest reluctance during the daylight hours, and theycategorically refuse to spend a night in the ruins. Horrible tales are told ofthose who have so dared - both natives and foreigners - and either diedshortly thereafter or simply failed to return from their nocturnal venture.According to tradition the city was created by a race of god-beings - the“Ani-Aramach” - who “came down from the sky in great canoes”. At thesame time the great stone structures of the city “just flew down from thesky” and settled in their present locations.This explanation may seem a bit on the fantastic side, but the “non-nonsensical” alternative is hardly more satisfying. The stone quarry is over30 miles away, and the construction of Nan-Madol would have necessitatedfirst the transport of blocks up to 30 tons in weight over to the city area -and then the raising of some of them as high as 60’. J. Macmillan Brown inThe Riddle of the Pacific estimates that a labor force in the tens ofthousands would have been necessary. He further notes that, within aradius of 1,500 miles from Ponape, there are today not more than 50,000people. [Hang on, Lemurians, we haven’t forgotten about you!]But back to the legend: The chief architects of the city were two of thegod-beings, Olo-chipa and Olo-chopa. It is interesting to note that thesenames bear a certain resemblance to Oro-tetefa and Uru-tetefa, thetraditional masters of the south Pacific secret society, the Brotherhood ofAreoi. [For the moment we decline to say anything about Azathoth andYog-sothoth.]Other demigods in the Ponapean pantheon include Icho-kalakal, thehideous war-specter god; the gigantic Kona monsters; Kili-unan, the demonof plague and disease; and Luka-lapalap, the Prince of Evil. It is Luka-lapalap who, during the building of the great city, is said to have “flownover the seas and bid the lands rise up”. In the darkened tropical forests ofthe island’s interior lurk the Kichin-Aramach, or “Little Ones”, whosequeerly-concealed cemeteries amidst the jungle are also Taboo to Ponape’shuman natives.Can Howard Phillips Lovecraft have known of the Ponapean god offestivals, life, death, and fortune - Nan-ul-lap? Or of the great sea god fromthe reef and the lagoon - Kutun? What of the city’s most dreaded site, Pan-Katara - the so-called haunted island, whose name means “The Sending-Forth of Messengers”? And what of the Itet Monster - a giant water lizard- 1023 -named Kieil-alap-amen, rumored to feast upon human sacrifices upon theisle of Itet?And then there is Nan-Tauach, the largest and most atmosphericstructure in Nan-Madol. Its name means “The Place of the Great Walls”,and it is the supposed enclosure of both A. Merritt’s Moon Pool and thetomb of the Sun-god Chau-te-Leur. The outlying basalt wall is 15’ thick and20-40’ high, and the entire parallelogram measures some 185’ by 115’.Within the outer wall is a courtyard, periodically reinfested with junglegrowth. There are irregular terraces of limestone and basalt, which lead upto the inner enclosure, also surrounded by a basalt wall 18’ high by 8’ thick.Passing through this second barrier one encounters the great vault orchamber of Chau-te-Leur or Chau-te-Reul. Three smaller vaults andnumerous mounds are also located within Nan-Tauach.Excavations in the area have yielded nothing to indicate the true natureof either the vaults or the entire structure. Assorted bones and artifactshave been found, but it remains open to conjecture whether or not Nan-Tauach was designed as a funerary structure. The discovery of certain oldtexts - such as the “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” - raises certain additionalpossibilities.R’lyeh is supposed to have arisen from the sea, and Nan-Madol has hadan irritating way of appearing a different size to various explorers whohappened to bump into it. In 1857 a Dr. L.H. Gulick wrote in a Hawaiianpublication that the non-submerged portion of the city was no greater than1/2 mile square. We shall leave it to our readers to draw their ownconclusions …Think you’d care to pay a visit to Cthulhu? It’s possible, but the path isnot a well-trodden one. Near Kapinga is the Rainbow Cliff Hotel (14 one-room cottages), and the nearby Hotel Pohnpei boasts 15 modern thatchedcottages with hot water. Electricity hasn’t made it there yet, so at night youhave a choice between torches and gas lamps. If you’re a lush and require acocktail lounge with your hotel, try the Kaselehlia Inn in Kolonia, with 10rooms and baths. Or you can always sleep in Nan-Tauach.For the fun of it, we called up a travel agent and requested informationconcerning Ponape. “Po-what?” was the response. “How about a nice trip toGuam or Saipan?” No, Ponape, we said, giving the coordinates. ApparentlyR’lyeh has yet to become a tourist mecca. The upshot of it was that only onepackage deal exists at the moment: a 21-day tour of 7 major Micronesianislands, starting from Hawaii and costing $750.- 1024 -Always interested in rocking the boat a little, the Church of Satan hasrequested information concerning an exclusive tour directly to and fromPonape, including only a stop at Honolulu coming and going. If we hear ofanything interesting, we’ll let you know.- 1025 -Appendix 58: “III° Elevations Announced”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-6, July-August VII/1972The Council of Nine is pleased to announce the recent ordinations offive Witches and Warlocks to the Priesthood of Mendes. Elevated by theCouncil are Priestess Margaret A. Wendall of California, Priestess DoloresV. Stowe of California, Reverend James L. Stowe of California, ReverendRobert Ethel of Washington, D.C., and Reverend L. Dale Seago of NorthCarolina.The path to the Satanic Priesthood is far more demanding than those toconventional ordination. To be considered for elevation to the III°,members of the Church must first attain the degree of Witch or Warlock. Ifthey desire admission to the Order of the Trapezoid, formal application tothe Council of Nine is then required. The candidate is evaluated andobserved over a period of time in both official and unofficial capacities. Hemay serve as a Regional Agent, a Grotto Leader, and/or a specialrepresentative of the Church. An extensive personal backgroundinvestigation is undertaken by the Council, and the applicant must alsocomplete a written examination. There is generally a personal interviewwith an official of the Nine. From a philosophical standpoint a SatanicPriest is required to possess familiarity with the world’s major religiousbeliefs and their existing alternatives [such as agnosticism, atheism, andmaterialism]. He must demonstrate a personal dissatisfaction with each ofthese, and he must explain his reasoning. Finally he must evidence a soundknowledge of Satanism as set forth in the Satanic Bible and otherpublications of the Church.Upon satisfaction of these requirements, the applicant is considered bythe Council for elevation to the III°. Unanimous approval is necessary, afterwhich the individual is nominated to the High Priest for ordination to thePriesthood of Mendes and admission to the Black Order. The degree isconferred by the High Priest and is effective immediately insofar as theChurch itself is concerned. Legal credentials are issued one year after initialelevation. Of crucial importance to the III° is that it distinguishes officialsof the Church from lay members. Those who aspire to the Priesthood mustrecognize that it involves a personal commitment to the Church and is notintended solely as a personal skill recognition.Occasionally the degrees of the Church of Satan are likened to those ofthe Golden Dawn or Astrum Argentum, whose grades bear certain- 1026 -resemblances. Grades in those magical fraternities were determinedwithout reference to one’s organizational function. A wild-eyed anarchistmight be pleased with the total absence of structure in the G.'.D.'. andA.'.A.'., but it was this factor more than any other which foreshadowed theirdownfall. There was no organizational identity or integrity; rather theyfunctioned via personality cults and power cliques. Thus theirfragmentation was merely a question of time.The degrees of the Church of Satan are not designed or intended as aladder which one must climb to become a “perfect” Satanist.The I° is characterized by a personal endorsement of the principles ofSatanism. It does not involve personal prowess in that medium.The II° constitutes official recognition by the Church of members whohave proven their individual skill in practical and theoretical Satanism. Itinvolves no organizational responsibility on the part of the recipient.The III°, among other things, identifies those whose exercise of theBlack Arts assists and educates the lay membership of the Church - and isnot directed solely towards personal advancement. A value judgment is notimplied; a highly-skilled magician whose interests are personal mayconsider the II° as the Church’s highest recognition in this field.Priests and Priestesses of the Church, correspondingly, must anticipatedemands upon their time that will be predicated upon the interests of theChurch as a whole. This will hold true for all members of the Order of theTrapezoid, although “underground” clergy will function in suitably variantroles from those of their announced counterparts.The Black Order’s relationship to the Grottos and individual membersof the Church differs totally from that of conventional religion, as mightwell be expected. Theist priests are expected to “take charge” of the flocks intheir areas of concern. The initiative lies with them - not with the individualmembers. The Satanic Priest may not supplant members’ initiative with hisown. Each Satanist, by definition, is a leader and philosopher in his ownright. The Priest may encourage and critique a member’s efforts, but onlyupon that person’s request. Thus the benefits of an organized structure areadded to those of a free-will magical philosophy.Occasional reference has been made to the Master Plan of the Churchof Satan. What this means is that the decisions of the High Priest and theCouncil are made with a view to the stature of the Church for the indefinitefuture, not just for temporal expediency. Certain executive decisions mayaccordingly appear somewhat arbitrary.- 1027 -The Church of Satan is neither a “game” nor a hobby in the eyes of theBlack Order. A factual sense of purpose at the policy-making level is whatwill ensure the enduring impact of Satanism.The Church is a secret organization in terms of its membership, not interms of philosophy. For the individual member to participate in groupactivities, he must take the initiative to contact his Regional Agent or GrottoLeader. Bypassing these officials to seek direct contact with a Priest orMagister will be discouraged, again for the simple reason that the Satanicclergy may not impede the initiative of local officials or Regional Agentsunless at their request.One member recently wrote to the Cloven Hoof to inquire if the Orderof the Trapezoid were not in fact the “inner circle” of Satanism, i.e. “wherethe action is”. The answer is most definitely no. The Black Order is a cadrestructure designed to serve the interests of the Church of Satan. Satanismas a philosophy cannot be characterized by introversion, since freedomfrom inhibition is its central tenet.- 1028 -- 1029 -Appendix 59: “The Question of Secrecy”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-6, July-August VII/1972As a social organization the Church of Satan is explosivelycontroversial, and this is quite understandable given the variableenvironment in which it must operate. At an earlier age such a philosophywould have been forced underground or forcefully destroyed by brute force.At a time of “Satanic excess” such as Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy,widespread political abuse of the principles of Satanism destroy the verysubstance of the base philosophy, even though cloaking its proponents withtemporary respectability [at the point of a gun in the examples given].The Church of Satan’s present posture in the United States is officially apublic one. Our existence is advertised through interviews, articles,commentaries, and the Cloven Hoof. Our organizational philosophy is setforth in the Satanic Bible for members and nonmembers alike. In spite of aconcentrated effort by our many detractors - both personal andinstitutional - to uncover a skeleton in our closet, our image and reputationremain impeccable. Yet each member of the Church of Satan, upon joining,confronts a personal Rubicon with regard to his own status.Regardless of the Church’s true ethics, the term “Satanism” has been solong equated with nihilism or sadism that he fears an unspoken - yetdamning - personal character assassination. How often have you heard thefollowing: “I have a great deal of enthusiasm for what you fellows represent,but I’m not joining ’cause I don’t want to lose my job.” As a material reasonthis is valid enough. Philosophy is a luxury - something to be enjoyed afterthe basic needs of one’s family have been seen to. Professionalphilosophers, furthermore, are few and far between - and are perenniallyunloved by life insurance companies. The immortal Status Quo may rarelybe provoked with impunity.Yet there is a point to be made here. In any revolutionary context -whether at the Rubicon in 49 BCE, in the 13 Colonies in 1776 CE, or in theRussia of 1917 - a stand must be taken, not only by the leader of themovement but by a certain number of his associates. If Julius Cæsar hadnot been followed across the river by his army, or if John Hancock’s hadbeen the only signature on the Declaration of Independence, it is highlydoubtful that the Roman Senate or George III would have paid seriousattention. In each case those who sided with the leader had no intention orexpectation of failure, hence no inhibiting fear of direct or indirect reprisal.- 1030 -Certainly an element of risk was involved; there is always a risk inanything worthwhile. But the odds were calculated and accepted. Such wasthe enthusiasm for the goal.In some ways the position of the Church of Satan may be morecontroversial than those of strictly political organizations, even though ourphilosophy does not bear upon the mechanics of mass government.Although we do not seek institutional power, we are insisting upon ageneral recognition of man’s true motives. This constitutes a challenge tofacets of every division of contemporary society. There will always be thosewho wish to silence us.If you are reading this issue of the Hoof as a nonmember, the questionis still an open one for you. You may cast your lot for or against Satanism,or you may just pull a Charlie Brown, hem and haw about the wholebusiness, and let the issue be resolved by others.What is your status as a member? Even though you are registered as a I° or II° Satanist, your affiliation will not be revealed by the organizationwithout your consent. You are a membership number and a recipient of theHoof, and it is your business if you are satisfied to remain a passiveparticipant. Many individuals wish to endorse a particular credo withoutreference to its parent school or society.To a certain extent the same holds true for the Order of the Trapezoid.Not all functions of the Priesthood involve exposure to the public, andmany of the organization’s most influential leaders have, for one reason oranother, chosen to remain clandestine.This is all well and good. Nevertheless the situation brings to mind thecharacteristics of an army of werewolves: If you encounter it underconditions of darkness [once a month], you’ll find it a foe to be takenseriously. In the bright light of day, however, it becomes perfectly harmless.Obviously it would be unrealistic to request every Priest and member towear a sign around his neck saying: “I’M A SATANIST (so sue me!)” Whilethe Central Grotto offers many benefits to members, unemploymentcompensation is not among them. [We do, however, have an excellentformula for removing tar and feathers.]Only you are in a position to judge the extent of your personalidentification with the Church, and this will remain your prerogativeindefinitely. In weighing your decision you are asked only to give dueconsideration to the social position which the Church of Satan can achieveif you take a personal stand on its behalf. Reputations do not “buildthemselves”.- 1031 -We have already fought - and won - a part of the battle. Among otherthings we are becoming increasingly disassociated from the foolishness ofold-style occultism, White Witchcraft, and irrational mysticism. We possessa sound philosophy, a flexible yet functional organization, and responsibleofficials. This is more than can be said for the majority of the world’sreligious bodies. We have the tools; let us not refuse to use them now thatthe goal is in view.- 1032 -- 1033 -Appendix 60: Ritual of Necromancy- by L.

Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-7, September-October VII/1972In the March VI Cloven Hoof we printed an article critiquing the theoryand practice of astrology [Appendix #16]. Within that same article, during adiscussion of the decomposition of the Zodiac, we made passing referenceto astronomer Fred Hoyle’s “steady state” theory of universal expansion.Shortly thereafter we received a gentle chiding from one or two of ourphysicist readers. “The Hoyle theory,” they said, “is generally believed to beobsolete in favor of George Gamow’s ‘big bang’ hypothesis.” The discoveryof quasars at distances far exceeding those of normal galactic separation,understandably, seems to invalidate Hoyle’s idea that a new galaxy appearswhenever two preexisting ones reach a set distance from each other.“Most certainly,” we answered sagely - and then hurried off behindclosed doors to find out just what this “big bang” business was all about.The answer was to be found in Gamow’s book The Creation of the Universe(New York: Viking Press, 1961 CE).Gamow’s version of the creation begins with a gigantic clump of matter- called an “ylem” - which existed alone in the universe about 10 billionyears ago. This ylem (also called an “atome primitif” by Belgian physicistGeorges Lemaitre) then exploded, separating into the various galaxies.Support for the “big bang” theory is enhanced by the “red shift”phenomenon, which indicates that all of the known galaxies are recedingfrom a universal - or metagalactic - center.That was all very nice, we thought, but Gamow still hadn’t come togrips with the actual problem of creation. His theory explained only theexpansion. Presumably someone or something would have had to createthe ylem in the first place. But Gamow begged express leave to sidestep thisissue, contenting himself with charting the universe’s behavior post- ylem.And so we were faced with an interesting little problem: Either come upwith an explanation for the creation of something out of nothing, or assumethe existence of a creative intelligence, i.e. a God or gods who said, “Letthere be ylem.” We turned to the writings of H.P. Lovecraft:Running through the fabric of the Cthulhu Mythos is the impliedexistence of a second, hidden “universe” - the abode of the Lovecraftianpantheon. Human and not-so-human disciples of the Great Old Ones try tobridge the gap between the two, with the most ghastly catastrophes arisingfrom their even partial successes. Nevertheless the Dæmons never cease- 1036 -trying to break through the barrier planes into the material cosmos. Theiraccomplishment of this, admonishes HPL, would presage cataclysmicdisaster for beings of matter.The immediate thing that interested us about HPL’s approach was thetheoretical existence of a negative or antimaterial cosmos to “balance” ourown. Mathematically at least this would provide for the creation of ourmaterial universe “out of nothing”, thus: [0 = +1 -1].So far, so good. Two derivative questions then arise: #1- Is there in factan antimaterial universe? #2- Presuming that there are two universes, whatforce impelled their separation from the “primal zero”?Before taking up the question of an entire universe - or two of them -let’s talk some atomic physics:A simple atom is composed of a positively-charged proton nucleus anda negatively-charged, orbiting electron. A question of symmetryimmediately arises: Why are all protons positive and all electrons negative?Why shouldn’t there be some atoms whose particle charges are reversed?Scientists began to get somewhere with this little thorn in 1932 CE,when the first positively-charged electron (or “positron”) wasexperimentally produced. A positron has precisely the same mass and spinas an electron, but its charge is +1 instead of -1. For laboratory productionof positrons it is necessary to use gamma radiation of extremely shortwavelength; both one electron and one positron are simultaneously createdfrom zero mass through energy conversion. To put it another way: Thegamma radiation consists of non-mass photons. Sufficient energy must bereleased from these photons to equal the mass of one electron and onepositron.Further success was achieved in Berkeley, California in 1955, when ahighly-energized (6.2 billion electron volts) proton beam was directed at asheet of copper. The result: creation once more of two particles - this time aproton and an antiproton - from zero mass. As is also the case withelectrons and positrons, the collision of a proton and an antiproton wouldinstantaneously annihilate both of them.The conjunction of a proton and an electron produces an atom. Intheory - though not yet accomplished in the laboratory - the conjunction ofan antiproton and a positron produces an antiatom, hence antimatter. Thereason that antimatter has not been artificially produced hinges upon thedifficulty of keeping it separated from material objects in the process.Should an object of antimatter be brought into contact with an object ofmatter, the result would be an explosion releasing many hundreds of times- 1037 -as much energy as a hydrogen bomb of the same weight. Kept apart fromcontact with matter, however, antimatter could produce molecules,elements, planets, and galaxies quite as easily as its material counterpart.These would be quite real in that they would possess physical mass; anantimatter universe, star, or planet would - from a distance - appearindistinguishable from a similar product of matter.For our formula [0 = +1 -1] to hold true, half the total mass in the entirecosmos must consist of matter, and the other half must be composed ofantimatter. Admittedly this must remain speculation for the present, but wefeel there are valid probabilities for the assumption.If this is in fact the case, it is so on a fairly large scale. The planet Earth,obviously, is uniformly matter. So is the Moon, or Neil Armstrong’s giantstep would also have been his last [had his spaceship survived thetouchdown]! Our Sun also consists of matter, for reasons that will requireeven more technical explanation. But, before proceeding, it will provenecessary to introduce yet another term: plasma.The Undead in the audience may sit down; this is another type ofplasma! To wit: A common gas (such as air) is made up of molecules whichare electrically neutral. By subjecting the gas to electrical discharge, intenseheat, X-rays, or ultraviolet light, electrons are torn loose from the moleculesvia impact by high-energy photon rays. This leaves the remainder of themolecule - called an ion - positively charged. Continued ionization of thegas would break down the molecular forms into atoms - and thence intosubatomic particles. A gas may become either totally or partially ionized,depending upon the degree of disruption that occurs. An ionized gas iscalled a plasma. It is known that the stars are composed of plasma which istotally ionized in the interior and only partially ionized in the outer andsurface layers [due to the decreasing temperatures towards the outer partsof the star].But here’s an interesting thing: Interstellar space - the area between thestars of a single galaxy - is not empty. It is filled with an extremely thin,rarified plasma. By “thin” we mean just that; there is only about one atomper cubic centimeter! Intergalactic space also consists of plasma, but at aneven lower density of 10-6 atoms/cc! Source of the plasma is normally theclosest star/galactic cluster, which implies that the atoms and ions of theplasma would bear the electrical charge characteristics of that star/galacticcluster.If there are in fact stars or galaxies of antimatter, it follows that thereshould be a little activity when the antimatter plasma encounters the- 1038 -material plasma from the nearest material star/galaxy [i.e. there would beannihilation and the emission of radiation]. Because the plasma is sorarified, however, such annihilation would take place at such a low level asto be invisible to our present instruments. Hence we shall have to waitawhile to run this particular test. Obviously it would be most convenientwere an antimatter star to collide with a material brother - as there wouldthen be a bang that would be quite visible indeed - but this isn’t likely tohappen inasmuch as the stars and galaxies are all receding from oneanother.For the moment, then, the intergalactic or interstellar existence ofantimatter cannot be conclusively proved - but neither can it be disproved.According to inductive logic, there is a stronger case for its presence thanfor its absence. Until we possess instruments which can measure theradiation differential of interstellar or intergalactic plasma, however, wecannot resort to deductive confirmation. For the purposes of the rest of thisarticle, though, we shall assume that one-half the mass of the universe is infact composed of antimatter. Now let us consider how the whole businesscame to be “created”.According to the Gamow theory, the metagalaxy (sum total of allgalaxies) was originally an ylem, which exploded. This theory leavesunresolved how the ylem came together in the original or primal state - andwhy it chose to explode at a given moment. Furthermore, since the ylemwas not homogeneous throughout all space, it would have had to bedeliberately created. It could not have consisted of both matter andantimatter, as the two substances would have annihilated one anotherinstantaneously. There would have been an explosion - and radiation - butno mass would have survived. And of course a ylem of matter andantimatter could not have been formed to begin with. Hence the “big bang”theory is both incomplete and unsatisfactory from a symmetricalstandpoint.Dividing the distances of the known galaxies from the calculatedmetagalactic center by their speeds [per the red shifts], we estimate thatthey began their outward journey 10 billion years ago. Gamow assumes thatthey all began at precisely the same moment, from an ylem. This is notnecessarily the case, however, since there is a 5% margin for error in thecalculations. Thus one galaxy could have been at the center 9.5 billion yearsago, while another one could have been in that position 10.5 billion yearsago. Proximity is conclusive; physical contact is not. And now a step-by-step hypothesis concerning the history of the universe:- 1039 -Stage One: Space exists in infinite magnitude. It is loosely anduniformly filled with radiation. This radiation obeys the assumption ofenergy conservation; it was never “created” and similarly it will never be“destroyed”. Its uniform presence throughout the cosmos requires no“cause”. There are no logical grounds to presume that a “primal vacuum”would be “more natural”.Stage Two: This strong concentration of radiation is partiallytransformed into equal quantities of matter and antimatter. The force ofgravitation begins to occur between the particles of the ambiplasma (theuniversal plasma which consists of both matter and antimatter). Theparticles begin to contract towards a gravitational focus [or towards aninfinite number of such focuses across the cosmos].Stage Three: As the particles of matter and antimatter approach oneanother, annihilation commences. This annihilation and consequentradiation grows as more particles approach the center and the chances forcollision are increased. Some particles of matter fuse with others of matter,and some of antimatter fuse with others of antimatter. Bodies of bothmatter and antimatter are formed, all of which continue towards thegravitational focus.Stage Four: The radiation pressure at the center increases to the pointwhere it overcomes the mutual gravitation that is forcing the ambiplasmato contract. The radiation arrests the contraction, and, due to momentum,overcompensates for the gravitation. The metagalaxy begins to expand.Stage Five: The clumps of matter and antimatter become galaxies.The central radiation becomes steadily weaker. It should be clear that all ofthis doesn’t take place within an hour or two. Due to the red shift we mayassume that Stage Four commenced about 10 billion years ago - give or takea billion - but we are scientifically unable to even estimate the duration ofthe first three stages.Finally this theory is necessarily cyclical, not linear. The metagalaxy -or the several metagalaxies - must be subject to expansion and contractioninfinitely into the past and future if the necessity for an initiatingintelligence is to be discarded. The existence of the Fourth Dimension,then, is the ultimate argument against the existence of a God or gods.There was no point of creation. There will never be a point of extinction.There is only the alternation and transformation of matter, antimatter, andenergy.Credit for this theory of the universal development is due to Dr. O.Klein, Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Stockholm. For a- 1040 -more extensive treatment of the theory, we invite your consultation ofHannes Alfven’s Worlds-Antiworlds: Antimatter in Cosmology, publishedby the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm (English translation: W.H.Freeman publishers, San Francisco and London).So there you have it. It stretches one’s head, admittedly, but we think itmakes more sense than the other “Genesis”! As a pointed postscript, youmay wish to muse upon the rationale for the extensive use of staticelectrical discharge and ultraviolet light in certain ritual proceedings of theChurch of Satan…[index-345_1.png][index-345_2.png][index-345_3.png][index-345_4.png][index-345_5.png][index-345_6.png]- 1041 -Appendix 62: “Satanism in Perspective”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-7, September-October VII/1972Were we asked to put our hoof upon the single most pressing questionconfronting our membership as a whole, we should have to answer that it isstill the definition of Satanism. To say that it is merely anti-Christianity oranti-theism, for instance, would be gross oversimplification. Nor should itbe considered classical paganism. The issue is not clarified, furthermore, bythe multitude of occult writings dealing with the Devil in some manner,shape, or form. It is ultimately the Church of Satan which holds theauthority to define its credo; it cannot be the intellectual vassal of consumeroccultism.So now let’s examine Satanism in the contexts of three interrelateddoctrinal fields: religion, philosophy, and political science. As what mightbe termed a “religious philosophy with political overtones”, Satanismoccupies a definite position in all three areas.First, in the context of religion, note chart #A.As you can see, it is basically a flow-diagram of religious variants. Thechart bears no relation to the passage of time, however, as many of the“earlier” forms of worship are still practiced to this day. Nor should thechart be interpreted to identify specific sects. Both Christianity and Islam,for example, are forms of monotheism.- 1042 -We think that the sequence of the chart should be more-or-less self-explanatory, so we won’t drag you through it one step at a time. Only acouple of important conclusions will be drawn. To begin with, there is awide gulf distinguishing Satanism from both monotheism and Whitewitchcraft. Most cursory analyses of Satanism do not recognize this,supposing our doctrines to be either a form of nature worship or a form ofdirect opposition to monotheism. Neither is the case. Satanism iscompletely independent of monotheism, and its only relation to traditionalwitchcraft is through ceremonial employment of a polytheistic pantheon.Included in “spiritualism” are such convictions as astrology, spiritworship, and forms of devotion to an afterlife. “Ceremonial occultism” hasits roots in the gnosticism of the middle ages, and it includes most of theSatanic sects of history. It also applies to groups or practices which aremore spiritualistic than Satanic - the Golden Dawn, for instance.“Symbolic polytheism” encompasses the religion of the later Greeksand Romans, who took their famous gods and goddesses with a grain ofsalt. In the “White witchcraft” grouping we find the diehards who take theirpaganism very literally. Thus they carry on man’s most primitive andelementary interpretation of the forces of nature.Satanism, according to chart #A, is a product of ceremonial occultismand atheism. The former factor is sufficiently recognizable, but our atheisticlineage may raise an eyebrow or two. Aren’t Satanists supposed to “believe”in the Devil?Yes, but not in so simple as sense as to merely venerate him as a hornedJehovah. Satan himself has deliberately rejected resemblance to a divinity,inasmuch as humans’ reliance upon “divine” will of any sort permits themto forsake their own sense of responsibility. Before one can become a trueSatanist, then, a sincere appreciation for the rationale of atheism a laNietzsche is called for. Satanism’s element of deification is applied tooneself, not to an external force.Until the advent of the Church of Satan in 1966 CE, rational intellectswere forced to choose between the doctrines of agnosticism and atheism.The first option is that of the cynic, who simply refuses to cope with religionin general. Atheism is the recourse of the logical mind, but its proponentsinevitably experience a depressing lack of purpose to their existence. Suchfrustration - or existentialist nausea, if you will - is answered throughSatanism, which fulfills both the factual and the fantastic needs of thehuman intellect.[index-347_1.png][index-347_2.png][index-347_3.png][index-347_4.png][index-347_5.png][index-347_6.png][index-347_7.png]- 1043 -The next major discipline we shall discuss is that of philosophy.Obviously it is closely related to religion, since both address many of thesame questions. Philosophy, however, is oriented more towards theresponsibility of the human intellect than is religion.Chart #B identifies philosophical approaches, not specific doctrines.Basic to all major philosophical approaches are the three concepts ofdivinity, society, and self. It might be said that all philosophy is essentiallyan argument concerning their complete or partial interrelationship.Particularly important to this article is the underlying current of mutualexclusion between the concepts of divinity and self. The attachment of anyemphasis to one immediately implies deemphasis of the other. Here in factis the true issue between God and Satan: It is Satan’s assertion of selfcompletely independent of God.Advancing up chart #B we see that “God’s will” can become virtuallysynonymous with that of society; this accounts for the strong influence ofinstitutional religion in human cultures. Abstract ethics or empiricism, onthe other hand, is fundamentally a personal philosophy against thebackground of society. It gives rise to either (1) a cold, predatory personalinterest at the expense of others, or (2) the philosophical shock ofexistentialism in the case of the altruist.[index-348_1.png][index-348_2.png][index-348_3.png][index-348_4.png][index-348_5.png][index-348_6.png][index-348_7.png][index-348_8.png][index-348_9.png]- 1044 -Satanism as a philosophy is a fusion of the more pragmatic features ofpersonal interest with the intellectual precision of existentialism. TheSatanist preys upon humankind, but he also appreciates the benefits of afavorable social environment. Contrary to the theist, however, he ignoresany standard of conformity for which there is no material reason. Heaccepts nothing on faith.Now we come to the rather hopeless mess that is, for want of a betterterm, called political science. To be strictly accurate, Satanism is not apolitical system itself. It has a place on chart #C, however, since it is verymuch a product of political values.Again we shall keep our hoofs crossed and hope that chart #C basicallyexplains itself, save for one or two notes ... Democracy, for instance: If itever really existed, it was during the flowering of ancient Athens, when thearistocracy decided that political power could actually be entrusted to thepeople. The consequences of this decision were demonstrated shortly- 1045 -thereafter, when the Athenian Empire was soundly thrashed by Sparta (anintolerant monarchy)."},{"pageContent":"Monarchy, in theory the least logical form of administration,dominated the world’s various governments until our own era. Then it wasfinally destroyed by the budding forces of egalitarianism in favor ofrepublicanism [after the Roman model], socialism, and autocracy. Takeaway all the surface trappings and you can boil all modern societies down totwo basic systems: competitive oligarchy and dictatorship.Communism in Marx’ sense, of course, doesn’t exist any more thandemocracy does. What its proponents call “communism” is just dictatorshippretending to be an economic doctrine. It isn’t.As was observed in “That Other Black Order” [see Appendix #44],fascism was history’s closest approximation of a “Satanist” form of nationalgovernment. As an experiment, however, it was an unqualified disaster. Thepredatory forces simply ran amok, bringing unbearable pressure to bearboth upon the parent society and the world at large. Æsop’s fox demandedtoo many grapes, hence obtained none at all.In our own time the world’s more advanced societies have tended tooverreact in the other direction. As Roger Price so aptly puts it in The GreatRoob Revolution: If everybody doesn’t want it, nobody gets it.Egalitarianism - or the rule of the lowest common denominator - hasbrought both the oligarchs and the autocrats of the Earth to their knees.Political positions are now taken only “in the common good” or “for thepublic welfare”.On chart #C this situation is depicted by the two terms “massoligarchy” and “mass autocracy”, characterizing a governmental or socialinability to move without an effective mandate from both the majority andthe minority of the citizenry. Since the situation constitutes a paradox, theonly political product is a massive rigidity or stasis. The slightest pressureagainst this stasis by advocates of non-egalitarianism elicits social outrageand condemnation, as does any suggestion of individual inequality.It is such a climate that has promoted both the formation and thegrowth of the Church of Satan - as a decidedly inegalitarian institution. TheSatanist considers himself a social predator, measuring his responsibilitiesto the host society in terms of its benefit to him. Essential to the survival ofSatanism in a socially-tolerated form are (1) a relatively small percentage ofSatanists within society and (2) Satanists’ ability to identify and actualizetheir personal goals without the knowledge of the mob. Thus true BlackMagicians indeed appear enigmatic to the public - even to the extent of- 1046 -ridicule. For it is through just such an atmosphere that they are able topursue their true goals without interference from others.- 1047 -Appendix 63: “Illuminism,the ‘Black Lodge of Masonry’”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-7, September-October VII/1972In the year 1770 CE a 22-year-old student at the University ofIngolstadt in Bavaria was elected Professor of Canon Law, a chair thattraditionally had been held by a Jesuit. Thus the new professor, AdamWeishaupt, was immediately subjected to the most determined attacks theSociety of Jesus could mount against him. Rather than acquiesce to hisantagonists’ threats, Weishaupt chose to retaliate. And so in 1776 hefounded the Order of Illuminati. The influence of this Satanic society was tospread throughout the states of Germany for the next six years, and itspolitical legacy was to appear in many of the national revolutions thatdominated that troubled era.Far from being merely a recreational fraternity after the fashion of Redand Blue Masonry, the Illuminati were in deadly earnest. Their avowedgoals included freedom for all communications media, the promotion ofrepublicanism, and the overthrow of both political and ecclesiasticalgovernmental tyranny. In order to strengthen his organization’s position inGerman social circles, Weishaupt sought alliance with Freemasonry. Aglance at the degree structure of Illuminism illustrates this:Symbolic Masonry:ApprenticeFellow CraftMaster MasonScottish Masonry:Illuminatus MinorIlluminatus MajorIlluminatus DirigensLesser Mysteries:PriestRegentGreater Mysteries:MagusRexIn the six Masonic degrees, members were evaluated for possibleadmission to the Mystery degrees. Those who were judged unreliable or of- 1048 -weak character were merely allowed to continue in Masonry. The successfulMystery candidate, on the other hand, was subjected to some of the mostexplosive political instruction to be found in 18th-century Europe.Ironically enough, the most “shocking” teachings of the Illuminati withregard to religion, philosophy, and government would hardly be consideredradical by modern standards; many of their positions are stated quiteconcisely in the American Constitutional Bill of Rights!Initiation through the degree of Priest was oriented towards Christianand Cabalistic symbolism. Priests, however, were systematically divorcedfrom their ties to the lower degrees’ Masonic organization. Instead theywere conditioned and sworn towards total allegiance to the Mysteries. Theprocess was carried one step further in the degree of Regent; thecandidate’s affiliation with all organized religions, states, and social groupswas severed.Even the existence of the two highest degrees was to remain unknownuntil Weishaupt’s personal ciphers and hieroglyphs were decoded followinghis death. According to his writings, the degree of Magus was based uponthe philosophy of Spinoza, showing all religions to be human inventionsand championing universal materialism. The degree of Rex taught that theindividual is rightfully sovereign, and that all institutional authority shouldbe abolished.Hints of the true character of higher Illuminism eventually reached theBavarian Masons, who reacted in a predictable fashion. A German Masonicconference officially denounced the Illuminati to the Bavarian governmentin 1782, and the organization was driven underground. The Ordercontinued to carry on its work in France and America, however, and itsoperations strongly influenced both the French and American revolutions.Among its more prominent members were Bode, the Abbé Talleyrand dePerigord, the Marquis de Gerardin, William Baron de Busch, and our veryold and dear friend, the Count of Saint-Germain.We note that the term “Illuminati”, like “Rosicrucian”, has been usedby a number of secret and not-so-secret societies since the 1500s. There is,however, only one way to determine the proof of a pudding.- 1049 -Appendix 64: “Murder Probe Sheds Light on WitchcraftCult”- by Arthur Lenehan, Jr.Sunday Star-Ledger, Newark, New Jersey, October 8, 1972Investigations into the death of a Springfield teenager have led to thediscovery of “witches” and “warlocks” practicing in New Jersey with all thesecret ceremonies and magic potions of their ancient craft. An Elizabethclergyman and a Rutgers University professor attributed the trend to drugabuse, but a self-described witch interviewed in Spotswood said more than50 young people have joined her clan simply because they are dissatisfiedwith conventional religions.The witch, the minister, and the professor were equally disturbed bythe death of 16-year-old Jeanette DePalma of Springfield, who wasmurdered two months ago. Union County authorities have refused tocomment on symbols of the occult reportedly found around the girl’s bodyon September 19, but Springfield police admit they brought a witch to thescene of the discovery in the Houdaille quarry. Sources who observed thatscene said makeshift wooden crosses were found around the body, enclosedin a trapezoidal perimeter of broken branches and logs.Members of the deeply religious DePalma family and the pastor of theirchurch, the Rev. James Tate, have said that Jeanette may have been thevictim of Satanists. “She was always a good girl, a straight girl. She wasnever on any kind of drugs,” Mrs. Florence DePalma said. “I believeSatanists may have killed her. It’s a possibility you can’t rule out. Jeanetteknew some of them at Springfield High School. They’re all around thisarea.”The Spotswood witch said some Black Magic groups do indulge inhallucination and ritual sacrifice, but she said her own group abhors thesepractices. The witch, who calls herself Lilith Sinclair, is a Priestess of theChurch of Satan, a cult organized in California a few years ago. “WhenSatanism is mentioned, many people immediately think of us,” MissSinclair said. “My people have been getting a lot of questions about theDePalma death, so I want to make it clear that we have nothing to do withanything like that.” Miss Sinclair recalled that members of her group weresimilarly harassed last summer after the Black Magic sacrifice of 20-year-old Patrick Newell in Vineland. Witnesses said Newell was bound hand andfoot and thrown into a pond at his own request. Friends of his said later- 1050 -that he wanted to die violently in order to command “40 legions of demons”in the afterlife.Miss Sinclair believes in demons and in her own magical control overthem, but she said that drugs and bloodshed play no part in the magic. “Thepower we generate comes from within ourselves,” she said. “The groupfocuses its attention on me, and I channel the psychic energy to accomplishwhatever the group had decided to do. We believe we can effect changeaccording to our will, if the willpower is strong enough.”The Spotswood clan or “Grotto” led by Miss Sinclair is a certifiedbranch of the nationally incorporated Church of Satan. Members carryplastic cards identifying them as “Citizens of the Infernal Empire”, and toweekly meetings they wear flowing black robes. According to Miss Sinclair,there are about 50 members in the North Jersey area. At the meetings, thegroup casts its spell over nonmembers through secret ceremonies called“destruction rituals” and “compassion rituals”. Miss Sinclair said shebelieves the psychic energy of the Grotto can bring illness and even death toits enemies, but such action is undertaken only in revenge for specificoffenses. She said the group has a hedonistic attitude towards sex, aided by“lust rituals” that cast seductive spells over members and nonmembersalike. The group’s chief holiday is Walpurgisnacht, a fertility festival thatcelebrates the return of spring on April 30.According to Miss Sinclair, the hedonism does not extend to “grouporgies”. “Our attitude is that if you want to remain faithful to one person,you should do it. If you feel you want a series of sex partners, you should dothat too and be honest about it,” she said. Miss Sinclair is a part-timefashion model who says that her interest in witchcraft dates from earlyyouth, when she was fascinated by films about the supernatural. She saidthat movies and television have played an important part in the success ofher cult, but adds that the restrictive nature of other religions is moreimportant. Her apartment is decorated with occult symbols, and both sheand her black cat Azazel are named after demons.- 1051 -Appendix 65: Ceremony of Ordination tothe Priesthood of Mendes- by Michael A. Aquino IV°Halloween VII/1972The Sentinels of the Abyss are summoned to enfold these chambers in asuspension of time and dimension, for the Great Flame of the Prince ofDarkness is to be drawn to our midst. As the Minions of Hell are convokedas witness, I charge ye to suffer no word of these proceedings to be passedto the profane. Yea, the unseen ones rip asunder the flesh of those whowould presume against Our Lord Satan, and he may not be provoked withimpunity.Hear now the legacy of the Order of the Trapezoid.In the Diabolicon of the High Daimons of Hell is recounted the firstgreat war of the Seraphim, wherein Lucifer and Masleh forced the universalopposition. From that epoch the entire cosmos has known the power ofboth stasis and change.And Earth - created for the preservation and glory of all that was God -it was to Earth that Satan came in æons past, to infuse the minds of the firstmen with the awareness of self. Since that day of the coming of the Fire, thestory of the race of man has been as that of the universe - torn and torturedby war, famine, pestilence, and death. Yet in the midst of death we are inlife - by the Gift of Satan we are become gods of our selves.By Satan was charged the High Daimon Belial to entrust the care of theFlame of Infernus to an Order of the Elect. And Belial brought to this Orderthe great Keys to the Shining Trapezoid that is the Gate to the Abyss, saying- Herein lies the geometric inspiration for the existence of our lord Satan,who is Lucifer, Lord of Light and ArchDaimon of Infernus. Observe that itdoth shape and define the inverse pentagram, which is itself our seal andthe key to all beauty of proportion.Even as the triangle and trihedron symbolize the selfless labor of men-beasts to support the apex - the throne of God - so we cast down anddestroy that apex. Thus we create our ensigns - the Trapezoid and theShining Trapezohedron, which are the ever-unfinished memorials to thecreative genius of man. In the first civilizations of Earth our monumentsshall be uplifted, yet with the passage of time they shall be changed andeffaced, and their origin clouded.But this Order shall endure until the race of man shall cease, and thosewho enter its fold shall behold the heart of the Fire, and they shall gaze- 1052 -upon the face of the ArchDaimon. Yea, nevermore shall they know peace,but their eyes shall be opened, and they shall become as Daimons, and theforces of all creation shall bend before their will. So it shall be done.These are the words of Belial, whom we honor as the Guardian of theFlame and first Magus of the Infernal Empire. By his word we of the BlackOrder have rejected the lure of unity, the subjugation of the cross, and theworship of the triad in all its forms and disguises.Embraced by the essence of the Fire of Life, we scorn the pious antics ofsuperstition and abasement - these are but pitiful endeavors to daunt theweak and the timid. A fool is he who places his foot upon the Path to theRight - he has lain down for death. The Black Magus is master of all things -none holds power over him. By the force of his person shall he vanquish allbarriers erected before him. His word shall be as law, and the ring of hislaughter shall dismay the worshippers of false gods. And ever before usshine the great Keys of the Bond between Hell and Earth, and from theTemple of the Ram shall come forth the Eternal Serpent of the Abyss,beloved of our Order, who is that called Leviathan.Advance to the altar of Hell, that the eye of Our Lord Satan may seizeupon you. As your mind is revealed to the lord of this world, do you affirmyour cause with Satan and accept of your free will his eternal Priesthood?[Response.]I bring your hand to that of Azazel, High Herald of the Infernal Empire,who shall set upon you the seal of the Priesthood of Mendes.In the name of Satan, and of his Exarch upon Earth, I name you to ourfellowship and send you forth - beyond the Abyss - to walk in ways ofstrangeness and of beauty. You are become as Belial - knowing no master -and you are a glory to your race and a brilliance before the sight of OurLord Satan.[Here is spoken the Third Enochian Key.]- 1053 -Appendix 66: “Is Satanic Image ReplacingHalloween Goblin?”- Hudson Dispatch, New Jersey, October 31, 1972It’s Halloween, when witches, demons, spirits, and goblins aresupposed to turn on the citizenry with their malicious deeds. But this year,as last year and next year, it’s the citizenry that’s turning more and more tothose supernatural beings. The tide has changed, not because the peopleare seeking to avenge the centuries of terror caused by the mere mention ofthe supernatural. But, according to one self-confessed witch: “The world ischanging, and old religions are no longer sufficient. The Age of Satan hascome.”Halloween was initially a concept of the Druids, an order of priests inancient France and Britain. They believed on this particular night spirits,witches, hobgoblins, and the like came out to harm people. They alsoconsidered the hours of midnight and noon sacred, an idea that is stillaround today. The Druids were destroyed in England in 78 A.D. butremained active in Ireland until Christianity replaced them in the 5thcentury.In New Jersey mention of the occult rarely reaches newspapers, andwhen it has it has only served to reinforce ideas that only wickedness cancome of witchcraft and the supernatural. In June 1971 in Vineland, PatrickNewell, 19, was found drowned with his hands and his feet bound. Twoteenagers pleaded non vult to the slaying, saying Newell asked them to killhim because he wanted to lead a band of demons. Last month in Springfieldthe body of Jeanette De Palma, 16, was found on a cliff surrounded bywooden crosses. The girl’s parents believe she “could have been the victimof black witchcraft and Satanism”.Lilith Sinclair, a Priestess and Grotto Leader of the Church of Satan inSpotswood, believes there are people around who are capable of killing inthe name of Satan. “These are the classical Satanists,” Miss Sinclair said.“They are true Devil worshippers who believe in sacrifices, just as in otherreligions you have people who kill in the name of God.” Miss Sinclair insiststhat these people are a lunatic fringe of Satanism, and that her church is “amore logical, intellectual group. We do not believe in the popular concept ofSatan with horns and a tail. We see him as a neutral force, a natural forcethat can affect the world. It is neither good nor bad, but a force that can beused by the individual.”- 1054 -Miss Sinclair’s Grotto is a chapter of the Church of Satan that wasfounded in San Francisco in April 1966. “We have our headquarters in SanFrancisco, just as the Catholic Church has its headquarters in Rome,” shesaid.The only requirement the church places on its members is a fullunderstanding of the principles of their religion as set forth in the SatanicBible. However, each Satanist is free to put the Bible’s teachings intopractice as he interprets them. “We’re just like any other church ororganization,” Miss Sinclair said. “We have group meetings twice a monthto discuss philosophy, some other popular subjects, the election of officers,and so forth. We also have rituals for compassion, destruction, and lust, butthe lust ritual is done privately.”The religion basically teaches members to believe in themselves, toenjoy life, and to follow their instincts. Miss Sinclair says her Grotto wasformed from a very small discussion group a year ago and now has morethan 30 members. Officials of the Church of Satan say there are “countlessthousands of people throughout the world who practice our teachingsalthough they are not registered members”.Miss Sinclair said, “One of the reasons they join is to be with peoplewho think like they do: ‘Do what you want as long as no undeserving personis hurt’. The religions of today are not satisfying the needs of the people,”she added. “People no longer want to accept things on blind faith. We feelthat people should live their lives as they see fit without having their valuesdictated and without imposing them on someone else.”The Church of Satan does not have rewards and punishments as doother religions. For example, Miss Sinclair was hesitant to comment on apossible afterlife. “I can’t say there is or isn’t. If there is anything thatsurvives after life, it’s man’s will. The Earth and all its pleasures are ourworld. Death is the great abstinence.”Miss Sinclair said the church does have its demons and devils, “but weuse them only as symbols; we don’t worship them”.Other items used in the church include incense, ceremonial robes, andaltar garnishings. Much of this is supplied by the Magician Occult ServiceCorporation, one of three New York City stores catering to the occult.Ronald Barrett, president of the firm, says his business has been increasingsteadily. He admits that the season has a lot to do with it, but at times “onecustomer will come in and buy a knickknack today, and tomorrow he’ll beback for $50 worth of accessories”.- 1055 -Although people outside the occult often consider it as entertainment,Barrett said, Satanists do take their religion seriously. “In the past theoccult has been a great ‘spook’ attraction and has been used generally to rippeople off. We classify ourselves as a religious goods store. We’re not out tosatisfy the curiosity seekers or anyone who just wants to trip out.” Aboutthe increasing popularity of the occult and Satanism, Barrett said: “Seriouspeople have put their religions to the question. They’re no longer willing tohave their lives dictated.”The incense sold has titles: “money incense”, “love incense”, “successincense”, and so forth. What are these things supposed to do? “We are notallowed to say what they can do or can’t do or are supposed to do,” Barrettsaid. “All I can say is that the label speaks for itself.” Barrett describeshimself as a ceremonial magician who has studied high magic on his own.He said he started his religious life as a Presbyterian and, after six years ofexperimenting with other religions that could possibly fill his needs, he leftChristianity. “I don’t want to die to get my reward. I want it now - a day’swage for a day’s work, if you will.”- 1056 -- 1057 -Appendix 67: “The Source”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-8, November-December VII/1972New members of the Church of Satan have occasionally commented onour curious “love/hate” relationship with Aleister Crowley and the theorieshe championed. Is he to be endorsed as a Magus or rejected as an irrationalfanatic? Was he - as he so often avowed - a practitioner of the Right-HandPath? Or are we to view his personal conduct and attitudes as evidencinghis true allegiance to the Left? The Cloven Hoof has fielded a number ofcommentaries on this issue since its inception, but a final statement has yetto be presented. Hence one of the motives behind this article.Prior to our own day Crowley was considered to be the prototype of theBlack Magician romanced in Dennis Wheatley novels. He was intellectuallybrilliant, a masterful author of prose and poetry, and an accomplishedstudent of Cabalism, Rosicrucian mythology, and Oriental mysteryreligions. He apologized to no one for his exotic style of life, and, despitethe many crises he was forced to weather, he went to his grave havingtasted more of the flavor of existence than many another historicalpersonage.As we have previously noted, Crowley repeatedly warned admirers thathe would not be responsible for their fate should they choose to follow theLaw of Thelema. This may have been a prudent safeguard for his own peaceof mind, but it was not the way to build a lasting social institution. Both theA.'.A.'. and the O.T.O. were unable to endure in their intended designs pasthis lifetime.In addition to Crowley’s dashing notoriety, there is a second reasonwhy one is compelled to admire him: He created an almost overwhelminglyvast system of magical mythology - an occult system that, in one way oranother, embraced practically every pagan system which had preceded it,including classical Satanism [but not White witchcraft]. It was among thestrongest mythological challenges ever mounted against Christianity, as itamounted to an “alliance” of all of Christianity’s competitors against thecommon foe. That Crowley failed to gain popular support for his granddesign is no surprise, given the era in which he lived. The two world warsserved to reinforce, not weaken existing theocratic institutions. The geniusof the Beast is that he almost single-handedly drew the blueprint for a“universal paganism”. Today, decades after his death, his writings have lostnone of their power.- 1058 -And yet Aleister Crowley made a most crucial mistake. In what mustremain one of history’s ironies, the Master Therion was ultimately anadvocate of the very discipline he detested so vehemently - Christianity.Formally, of course, Crowley had nothing to do with Christianity. But inthe conceptual context of religion, he served to bolster the foundation uponwhich it stood. To explain this we must turn to the birthplace of ourWestern religious tradition, ancient Egypt.The United States has been a national entity for less than two centuries;the Roman Empire existed for fewer than ten. Imperial Egypt, by contrast,endured for over three thousand years. This is significant in itself, but tothe Satanist it is doubly provocative. What philosophy and theology did theEgyptians pursue which enabled them to so sustain their culture?In any library or bookstore you will find scores of volumes eager to tellyou the story of Egypt. They range from colorful picture books to theponderous tomes of Wallis Budge and his contemporaries. In scope, price,and elegance they may differ, but they all tend to discuss Egyptian religionin a fashion that would have seemed entirely reasonable to AleisterCrowley.According to the usual rote, the Egyptians were preoccupied withdeath, the promise of an afterlife, and the prospect of corporealreincarnation. They accordingly devoted their entire lives to preparation foradmission to Amenti, the kingdom of the dead, which was ruled by the godOsiris, his wife Isis, and their son Horus - the three chief deities of Egypt.There also existed a multitude of other gods and goddesses, most patrons ofparticular cities, arts, or sciences. The most reprehensible among them wasSet, the god of evil, who had treacherously slain Osiris only to be thwartedby Isis and Horus. The entire Egyptian religion was eventually eclipsed byan independent competitor - Judaism - and then again by the advent ofChristianity. Osiris, Isis, and Horus became the patrons of occultists,though traditional White witches claim no allegiance to them. Today theyare Satanic figures.Now kindly turn to pages #145-6 in the Satanic Bible. While many ofhistory’s most noted Dæmons are listed, Isis, Osiris, and Horus arenowhere to be found. Why is this the case? And Crowley, while ostensibly aCabalist, declared in the Book of the Law and other writings that the entireprocess of human civilization has been successively overseen by these threeintelligences - leading up to the “Æon of Horus” in his own time. Whyshould this approach be spurned by the Church of Satan?- 1059 -The answer is that the Osirian trinity is not Satanic, but stands ratherfor everything the true Satanist finds repugnant. Nor were Osiris, Isis, andHorus the true supreme deities of Egypt; they were accepted only in timesof misery and duress. They ruled through fear and the threat of aposthumous “day of judgment”. Osiris was to metamorphose into theYahweh/Jehovah of the Hebrews. Isis was to become assimilated into awide variety of cultures, eventually reappearing as the “goddess of thewitches”. And Horus, the savior of mankind, has also returned - in thecharacter of Jesus Christ!The Master Therion, in proclaiming the “Crowned and ConqueringChild” his personal mentor, could not have made a more tragic error. Manyof his major works, despite their lyrical and æsthetic appeal, areconceptually useless to the Black Magician because of this singlepredication, just as a sophisticated mathematical equation based upon afalse axiom must itself prove erroneous. Let us examine the historicalrecord:The earliest existing evidence of human culture in the Nile valley datesto more than 250,000 BCE, as the remnants of hand axes and other stonetools have been uncovered 50-100’ below the Nile’s silt terrace. Sometimebetween 10,000 and 7,000 BCE a most important event took place - thedomestication of the wild African goat and the subsequent freedom to begincultivation of grain. This effectively heralded the beginning of humancivilization, as for the first time primitive man was free to turn his thoughtsto matters other than a constant search for food.It was in the pre-dynastic Gerzean period (commencing about 3600BCE) that the first communities of the future Egyptian nation came intoexistence - among them Buto, Bubastis, Sais, Tanis, and Behedit in the Niledelta. These last two cities were the capitals, respectively, of the twooriginal Egyptian god-figures, Set and Horus. This Horus, while also falcon-headed, is generally referred to as “Horus the Elder” by Egyptologists todistinguish him from the later, Osirian figure.The great war of unification commenced in approximately 3400 BCE.The followers of Horus were driven from Behedit to Hierakanopolis inUpper Egypt (south of the delta), where they rallied to the Red Crown ofHorus against the White Crown of Set. After more than two centuries ofintermittent conflict between Upper and Lower Egypt, the land was finallyunited under Menes (or Narmer), the first Pharaoh of the I Dynasty. Thuswas created the famous Double Crown of Egypt - the merging of the Redwith the White - though its initial symbolism was eventually obscured. Set- 1060 -and Horus the Elder became the first symbols of the principle of duality.And, while Horus was patron of the day and Set of the night, there was areconciliation of the all-encompassing glory of life between them. Graduallythis principle became symbolized by a single god of life - Amon, the GreatRam, who created the Shining Trapezoid.In the III Dynasty (2760-2680) Imhotep, Master of the Order andMinister to Pharaoh Zoser, commemorated the deification of mankind byerecting the first trapezohedron-shaped “step pyramid” for the monarch.This unique monument was forerunner to the many ceremonial pyramidsof the IV Dynasty (2680-2565), including the famed Giza group [seeAppendix #33]. Simultaneously Egypt adopted the striking trapezoidalgateway which henceforth characterized her architectural style. Imhotephimself became a semi-legendary figure; his most recent portrayal was byBoris Karloff in The Mummy!The first 10 dynasties comprise what is now described as the Archaic,the Old Kingdom, and the First Intermediate periods. During this time thegovernment was centralized at Memphis. With the advent of the MiddleKingdom (Dynasties XI-XII, 2050-1785), the capital was moved to Thebes,center of the Priesthood of Amon. The philosophy of that era is exemplifiedin the “Song of the Harper” from the XII Dynasty: “Do what you wish to doand what will bring you pleasure. Enjoy yourself while you are here, and donot worry until the end comes. Enjoy each day to the fullest. For none cantake his possessions with him, and no one who has passed on can return.”From 1730 to 1580 Egypt was first invaded and then ruled by theHyksos, an Asiatic people whose bronze weapons overpowered theEgyptians’ copper. It was an era of humiliation and misery for Egypt, andunder such conditions some of the populace looked longingly towards theprospect of an afterlife. A new cult devoted to an obscure underworldspecter - the living corpse Osiris - seemed to offer hope, and the sect’sinfluence began to spread. In an effort to assimilate its rivals, the new belief- commencing a pattern later followed by Christianity - incorporated someof the most venerable Egyptian gods and goddesses into its mythology.Horus was called Osiris’ son, and Set became his implacable enemy.Nepthys, originally the consort of Set, became an ally of Osiris and Isisagainst him, and Set’s son Anubis was accorded a role that would have beenanathema to his father - the guardianship of the dead and the mummified.When the native Egyptian pharaohs of the XVIII Dynasty (1580-1340)finally overthrew the Hyksos, the growth of the Osirian cult abated but didnot disappear altogether. Prosperity returned to the land, and the glory of- 1061 -Amon again prevailed. This was Egypt’s New Kingdom era, whereinappeared the great Amenhoteps and Thutmosids of the Empire. The onlymajor disruption occurred at the end of the dynasty, when Amenhotep IV(Akhenaten) rejected the Great Ram for the worship of Aton, a minor Sundeity. [The AMORC acclaims Akhenaten as its spiritual founder. Such anaffiliation, while unsubstantiated, might not be inappropriate: Invasion,starvation, and civil war marked his reign (1370-1352), and he was finallyassassinated by his own court.] Until 1340 the throne was held byTutankhamen, who was followed by the General Horemheb, founder of theXIX Dynasty.The XIX and XX Dynasties may justly be called the Satanic era ofImperial Egypt. The Osirian death-worship fell into widespread contempt,and Egypt rose to the height of its civilization, patronage of the arts andsciences, and political influence in the Mediterranean. Great strides weremade in the fields of medicine, astronomy, and agriculture, and judicioususe of the military preserved the peace at home and abroad. Many othercultures now came under Egypt’s rule or protection. Among these were theHebrews, a group of nomadic shepherds who originally sought the favor of- 1062 -Rameses I. 861 Having few material assets, they presumably embraced theOsirian faith because of its emphasis on rewards in the hereafter. Hencethey incurred the displeasure of Rameses’ successor Seti I, whose royalname had been taken in honor of the death-god’s eternal enemy. Seti’scontempt for the Hebrews led to their persecution and enslavement. Yetsuch was their fanaticism and rebelliousness that the next Pharaoh,Rameses II, finally drove them out of Egypt altogether. 862 Nevertheless itwas Seti’s name that was nourished as the symbol of all the Hebrewshated. 863 In time this name was accorded the arch-enemy of their ownOsiris-derived god.The XX Dynasty marked the end of native rule in Egypt. With the deathof its last Pharaoh, Rameses III, the land was occupied by a succession of861 Although Jewish lore states that the original Hebrews were a unified,foreign culturewhich entered Egypt during the time of Rameses I, there are no Egyptian recordssubstantiating this. It is more probable that the actual participants in any“Exodus” wereGoshen slaves from a variety of ethnic backgrounds who revolted and left thecountry.The word “Hebrew” is Egyptian hieroglyphic for “displaced person”. Moreover, inhisdefinitive work Testament (New York: Henry Holt, 1988), archæologist John Romerstates:Hard evidence of the Exodus event in the preserving deserts of the Sinai,where most of the biblical Wandering takes place, is similarly elusive. Althoughits climate has preserved the tiniest traces of ancient bedouin encampments andthe sparse, 5,000-year-old villages of mine-workers, there is not a single traceofMoses or the Israelites. And they would have been by far the largest body ofancient people ever to have lived in this great wilderness. Neither is there anyevidence that Sinai and its little natural springs could ever have supportedsuch amultitude, even for a single week. Several 19th-century vicars recognized thisfactwithin a day or two of the start of numerous expeditions in search of Moses’footsteps. “Escaping from the rigours of an English winter,” as one of themsays,“in a land of the flock and the tent to which our only guide was the Bible” theyquickly realized that the biblical Exodus was logistically impossible and thattheBible was a most ambiguous guide to that desolate region. The biblicaldescription of the Exodus, then, flies in the face of practical experience.Indeedthe closer you examine it, the further it seems removed from all of ancienthistory.862 If there were a “Pharaoh of the Exodus”, it would most probably have beenMerenptah, during whose reign is recorded a revolt in Goshen. There are norecords ofany such disturbances during the reign of Rameses II, Cecil B. DeMillenotwithstanding.863 It is conjectural whether the Hebrews’ hated “Satan” derives from Set orfrom Seti I.The hieroglyphic term Set-hen specifically identifies the god, i.e. his formaltitle“Majesty of Set”.- 1063 -foreign conquerors. The Priesthood of Amon at Uast (Thebes) managed toretain its structure from the end of the XX Dynasty (1085) to Thebes’ finalsacking and destruction by Ashurbanipal of Assyria (663). It was shortlythereafter, in the reign of the Saite Pharaoh Amasis (569-525), that one ofthe last temples of Amon communicated the traditions of the Order to suchselect visitors as Pythagoras, that the ancient Egyptian mysteries mightsurvive the pillage and ruin of the Nile nation itself.In this period the Osirian cult expanded until it dominated all of Egypt.The other Khemite deities were included in the Osirian mythos, and finallyonly a vestige of the ram-cult survived - at the city of Ba-neb-tett (Mendes)in the delta. Egypt was invaded first by the Persians, then by theMacedonians under Alexander the Great, and finally by the armies of Juliusand Octavian Caesar. And at this point Khem’s history as an ancientnational entity draws to a close.During the post-dynastic period the Osirian cult spread beyond theborders of Egypt into practically every other culture of the Mediterraneanworld. Although rejected by the Jews, Isis in particular was highlyvenerated by the Romans, who introduced a wide cross-section of religionsinto the far reaches of their empire. Thus Isis was to survive as the centralfigure of innumerable pagan fertility cults, the more so since a comparablediffusion had occurred via the Phœnicians’ sea ventures in previouscenturies. On a final ironic note, Isis was to gain additional enshrinement -as the mother of the Christians’ “Horus”.As for Set, his cult was also preserved for a time after the destruction ofTanis. In Ptolemaic times Set was known by the Greek name of Typhon, theGreat Serpent of the Abyss, and he eventually became the High DæmonLeviathan. Hence the Sigil of Baphomet incorporates the Great Ram, thename of Leviathan, and the “Pythagorean” pentagram, which in its inverseposition defines the Shining Trapezoid, ancient symbol of the Black Order.It is from this legacy that the Order of the Trapezoid has brought intobeing the Church of Satan. And while due honor is accorded the greatSatanic figures of the past, many of them are known today by the namesthey have taken under the customs and traditions of modern nationalcultures. Time is not a constant, and the Goat of Mendes arises in a new age- the Age of Satan.- 1064 -- 1065 -Appendix 68: Black Mass from La-Bas- by J.K. HuysmansThe canon solemnly knelt before the altar, then mounted the steps andbegan to say mass. Durtal saw then that he had nothing on beneath hissacrificial habit. His black socks and his flesh bulging over the garters,attached high up on his legs, were plainly visible. The chasuble had theshape of an ordinary chasuble but was of the dark red color of dried blood,and in the middle, in a triangle around which was an embroidered border ofcolchicum, savin, sorrel, and spurge, was the figure of a black billy-goatpresenting his horns.The sacrifice ceased. The priest descended the steps backward, knelt onthe last one, and in a sharp, tripidant voice cried:“Master of Slanders, Dispenser of the benefits of crime, Administratorof sumptuous sins and great vices, Satan, thee we adore, reasonable God,just God!“Superadmirable legate of false trances, thou receivest our beseechingtears; thou savest the honour of families by aborting wombs impregnated inthe forgetfulness of the good orgasm; thou dost suggest to the mother thehastening of untimely birth, and thine obstetrics spares the still-bornchildren the anguish of maturity, the contamination of original sin.“Mainstay of the despairing Poor, Cordial of the Vanquished, it is thouwho endowest them with hypocrisy, ingratitude, and stiff-neckedness, thatthey may defend themselves against the children of God, the Rich.“Suzerain of Resentment, Accountant of Humiliations, Treasurer of oldHatreds, thou alone dost fertilize the brain of man whom injustice hascrushed; thou breathest into him the idea of meditated vengeance, suremisdeeds; thou incitest him to murder; thou givest him the abundant joy ofaccomplished reprisals and permittest him to taste the intoxicating draughtof the tears of which he is the cause.“Hope of Virility, Anguish of the Empty Womb, thou dost not demandthe bootless offering of chaste loins, thou dost not sing the praises ofLenten follies; thou alone receivest the carnal supplications and petitions ofpoor and avaricious families. Thou determinest the mother to sell herdaughter, to give her son; thou aidest sterile and reprobate loves; Guardianof Strident Neuroses, Leaden Tower of Hysteria, bloody Vase of Rape!“Master, thy faithful servants, on their knees, implore thee andsupplicate thee to satisfy them when they wish the torture of all those wholove them and aid them; they supplicate thee to assure them the joy of- 1066 -delectable misdeeds unknown to justice, spells whose unknown originbaffles the reason of man; they ask, finally, glory, riches, power, of thee,King of the Disinherited, Son who art to overthrow the inexorable Father!”Then Docre rose, and erect, with arms outstretched, vociferated in aringing voice of hate:“And thou, thou whom, in my quality of priest, I force, whether thouwilt or no, to descend into this host, to incarnate thyself in this bread,Jesus, Artisan of Hoaxes, Bandit of Homage, Robber of Affection, hear!Since the day when thou didst issue from the complaisant bowels of aVirgin, thou hast failed all thine engagements, belied all thy promises.Centuries have wept, awaiting thee, fugitive God, mute God! Thou wast toredeem man and thou hast not, thou wast to appear in thy glory, and thousleepest. Go, lie, say to the wretch who appeals to thee, ‘Hope, be patient,suffer; the hospital of souls will receive thee; the angels will assist thee;Heaven opens to thee.’ Imposter! thou knowest well that the angels,disgusted at thine inertness, abandon thee! Thou wast to be the Interpreterof our plaints, the Chamberlain of our tears; thou wast to convey them tothe Father and thou hast not done so, for this intercession would disturbthine eternal sleep of happy satiety.“Thou hast forgotten the poverty thou didst preach, enamoured vassalof Banks! Thou hast seen the weak crushed beneath the press of profit; thouhast heard the death rattle of the timid, paralyzed by famine, of womendisembowelled for a bit of bread, and thou hast caused the Chancery of thySimoniacs, thy commercial representatives, thy Popes, to answer bydilatory excuses and evasive promises, sacristy Shyster, huckster God!“Master, whose inconceivable ferocity engenders life and inflicts it onthe innocent whom thou darest damn - in the name of what original sin? -whom thou darest punish - by virtue of what covenants? - we would havethee confess thine impudent cheats, thine inexpiable crimes! We woulddrive deeper the nails into thy hands, press down the crown of thorns uponthy brow, bring blood and water from the dry wounds of thy sides.“And that we can and will do by violating the quietude of thy body,Profaner of ample vices, Abstractor of stupid purities, cursed Nazarene, do-nothing King, coward God!”“Amen!” trilled the soprano voices of the choir boys.Durtal listened in amazement to this torrent of blasphemies andinsults. The foulness of the priest stupified him. A silence succeeded thelitany. The chapel was foggy with the smoke of the censers. The women,hitherto taciturn, flustered now, as, remounting the altar, the canon turned- 1067 -toward them and blessed them with his left hand in a sweeping gesture.And suddenly the choir boys tinkled the prayer bells.It was a signal. The women fell to the carpet and writhed. One of themseemed to be worked by a spring. She threw herself prone and waved herlegs in the air. Another, suddenly struck by a hideous strabism, clucked,then becoming tongue-tied stood with her mouth open, the tongue turnedback, the tip cleaving to the palate. Another, inflated, livid, her pupilsdilated, lolled her head back over her shoulders, then jerked it brusquelyerect and belaboured herself, tearing her breast with her nails. Another,sprawling on her back, undid her skirts, drew forth a rag, enormous,meteorized; then her face twisted into a horrible grimace, and her tongue,which she could not control, stuck out, bitten at the edges, harrowed by redteeth, from a bloody mouth.Docre contemplated the Christ surmounting the tabernacle, and witharms spread wide apart he spewed forth frightful insults, and, at the end ofhis forces, muttered the billingsgate of a drunken cabman. One of the choirboys knelt before him with his back toward the altar. A shudder ran aroundthe priest’s spine. In a solemn but jerky voice he said, “Hoc est enim corpusmeum,” then, instead of kneeling, after the consecration, before theprecious Body, he faced the congregation, and appeared tumefied, haggard,dripping with sweat. He staggered between the two choir boys, who, raisingthe chasuble, displayed his naked belly. Docre made a few passes and thehost sailed, tainted and soiled, over the steps.Durtal felt himself shudder. A whirlwind of hysteria shook the room.While the choir boys sprinkled holy water on the pontiff’s nakedness,women rushed upon the Eucharist and, grovelling in front of the altar,clawed from the bread humid particles and drank and ate divine ordure.Another woman, curled up over a crucifix, emitted a rending laugh,then cried to Docre, “Father, father!” A crone tore her hair, leapt, whirledaround and around as on a pivot and fell over beside a young girl who,huddled to the wall, was writhing in convulsions, frothing at the mouth,weeping, and spitting out frightful blasphemies. And Durtal, terrified, sawthrough the fog the red horns of Docre, who, seated now, frothing withrage, was chewing up sacramental wafers, taking them out of his mouth,wiping himself with them, and distributing them to the women, whoground them underfoot, howling, or fell over each other struggling to gethold of them and violate them.The place was simply a madhouse, a monstrous pandemonium ofprostitutes and maniacs. Now, while the choir boys gave themselves to the- 1068 -men, and while the woman who owned the chapel mounted the altar,caught hold of the phallus of the Christ with one hand and with the otherheld a chalice between “His” naked legs, a little girl, who hitherto had notbudged, suddenly bent forward and howled, howled like a dog …- 1069 -Appendix 69: al-Jalwa li Arbab Ahl al-Khalwah( The Book of the Revelation)- by Sheikh Shams al-Din Abu Mohammed al-Hasan,“Crown of the Learned” of the Yezidi Nation, ca. 1200 CEChapter One1.

Aquino IV°in The Satanic Rituals864Even to those of his most intimate acquaintance, Howard PhillipsLovecraft (1890-1937) remained frustratingly enigmatic. From the pen ofthis ingenious New Englander came a collection of the most convincing andthoroughly terrifying works of macabre fiction in modern times, and histales were uniquely embellished with painstaking pseudo-documentationand meticulous descriptions of character and setting. It is frequentlyremarked that, once having read Lovecraft, one disdains the efforts of thecompetition. Such an attitude has consistently proven itself extraordinarilydifficult to refute.As might well be expected, Lovecraft was lionized and extensivelyimitated by a number of writers whose imaginations were sparked by thelure of his celebrated “Cthulhu mythos” - a term commonly given to a seriesof stories based upon a supernatural pantheon of Lovecraft’s owninvention. Possessed of a firm conviction that reference to classicalmythologies would undermine the atmosphere of cyclic and spatialdisorientation he sought to create, Lovecraft introduced a race of beingswhose prehistoric activities upon Earth set in motion the forces of man’sown civilization and genius - as well as the horrors of his educatedimagination. While Freud and Einstein wrestled with their respectivedisciplines in the isolation of academic specialization, Lovecraft proceededto illustrate the astonishing influence of physical and geometric law uponthe subconscious psyche. While he might have hesitated to style himself a864 When this essay appeared in the Satanic Rituals, Anton LaVey added to itseveralconcluding paragraphs of his own, suggesting that HPL was aware of actual ritessimilarto those in his stories and that he alluded to them in his writing. Hiscorrespondencebelies this. On March 6, 1935, for example, he wrote to Emil Petaja: “In the1890s thefashionable decadents liked to pretend that they belonged to all sorts ofdiabolic BlackMass cults, & possessed all sorts of frightful occult information. The onlyspecimen ofthis group still active is the rather over-advertised Aleister Crowley … who, bythe way, isundoubtedly the original of the villainous character in H.R. Wakefield’s HeCometh &He Passeth By. The monstrous elder world - atavistic glimpses of which sometimesflashinto the memories of modern persons - conjured up by Chambers is founded on oneortwo chance allusions in the stories of Ambrose Bierce … Hastur, Lake of Hali,&c.Chambers borrowed Bierce’s artificial mythology just as Clark Ashton Smith & Ialludeto each other’s artificial mythologies in our respective tales.”- 1078 -master of scientific speculation, he is no less deserving of that title than areAsimov and Clarke.What has puzzled many of Lovecraft’s admirers is the author’s almostcasual attitude towards his work. Far from regarding it jealously, herepeatedly referred to it as a mere means of financial subsistence. Toindividuals who suspected that he entertained a private belief in themythos, he would reply with candor that an objective detachment fromone’s subject material is necessary for effective writing. He was wont tomention the most nightmarish of his narratives with a levity borderingupon scorn, as though he did not consider them of genuine literarysubstance. As an author Lovecraft enjoys an established reputation, butwhat of Lovecraft the philosopher? Until now the question has remainedmoot.Perhaps the most significant clues to the philosophy embodied in theCthulhu mythos derive from the author’s fascination with human history,particularly that of the classical eras. That many of his creations drewstrongly from Egyptian and Arabic legends is well-known, and there isevidence that he was acutely aware of civilization’s effects upon mankind -both educational and repressive. He sensed man’s compulsion towardsknowledge even at the risk of sanity, and yet his tales constantly remind thereader that humanity is but a short step from the most depraved andvicious forms of bestiality. Intellectual excellence, he seemed to say, isachieved in concert with cataclysmic terror - not in avoidance of it.This theme of a constant interrelationship between the constructiveand destructive facets of the human personality forms the keystone of thedoctrines of Satanism, even as theism argues that the integrity of theindividual can be increased by a rejection of the carnal and an obedience tomorality. Lovecraft recorded his aversion to conventional religious dogmain The Silver Key, and he regarded with a similar scorn those who wouldreject an opiate of the norm only to succumb to a controversial substitute,i.e. the popular notion of witchcraft. The concept of worship per se isstrikingly absent from the Cthulhu mythos itself. Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth, and Cthulhu are all honored through bizarrefestivals, but the relationship is invariably that of teacher to students.Compare the description of a Lovecraftian ceremony to that of a Christianmass or a Voodoo rite, and it will be seen that the element of servility isdefinitely lacking in the former.Lovecraft, like the Miltonian Satan, chose to reign in Hell rather than toserve in Heaven. His creatures are never conclusive stereotypes of good or- 1079 -evil; they vacillate constantly between beneficence and cruelty. And ever insynthesis they represent knowledge, for which the protagonist of each storyabandons every prudent restraint. Patent representations of the Old Onesas Aristotelian elementals - or as a collective influence of malignancy whichman must destroy if he is to prevail - suggest a philistine disposition on thepart of the reviewer. Lovecraft, if indeed he tolerated such analyses, canhardly have been impressed by them.Assuming that Lovecraft was thus an advocate of Satanic amorality,what might have been the content of the ritual observances in Innsmouth,R’lyeh, or Leng? The author is amusingly suggestive only to the extent of anoccasional, lurid quote from some “nameless rite” or “unspeakable orgy”celebrated by grotesque apparitions amidst sulfurous caverns offluorescent, decaying fungi … or against titanic monoliths of insidious anddisturbing aspect. Perhaps he thought understatement to be more effectivein freeing the imaginations of his readers. But one cannot help speculatingupon the reality foreshadowed by the fantasy - the subtle possibility that theOld Ones are the spectres of a future human mentality.It is in consequence to such speculation that “The Ceremony of theNine Angles” and “The Call to Cthulhu” are advanced. One emphasizespotential; the other reflects the dimness of an almost forgotten past. As forthe linguistic phonetics, they bear no given name. The translation is asaccurate as contemporary methods permit.- 1080 -- 1081 -Appendix 72: “The Ceremony of the Nine Angles”- by Michael A.

Aquino V°Nyctalops Magazine #13 - May 1977It was in one of those small, musty bookshops lining HollywoodBoulevard that I came across a copy of the Nyctalops #10, sandwichedroughly into a shelf between an 1895 edition of The King in Yellow and arather decrepit-looking book labeled Qanoon-e-Islam. Leafing throughNyctalops, I was pleasantly surprised to encounter Rob Hollis Miller’sprovocative and perceptive article “Lovecraft and Satanism”. Therein Ifound myself quoted twice - once from my introduction to Anton SzandorLaVey’s Satanic Bible, and again via excerpts from the H.P. Lovecraft essayand rituals which I wrote for LaVey’s Satanic Rituals. Miller’s analysis ofboth the essay and the rituals was admirable, so much so that I decided tooffer Nyctalops an exclusive expose on the actual story behind thatmaterial.During 1971-72, while Anton LaVey was writing/assembling the otheressays and rituals for the Satanic Rituals, he invited me to contribute aLovecraftian section to be included in that book. I accepted, but I soonfound that I had undertaken no small task. Lovecraft’s stories abound inreferences to his monstrous gods, but of actual “nameless rites andunspeakable orgies” there are few detailed descriptions. Such rituals as aredescribed at length - as in The Horror at Red Hook, The Festival, andImprisoned with the Pharaohs - are reported by horrified, ignorantonlookers.Then, too, there were conceptual problems that would have to beaddressed. What was the Lovecraftian cosmological system, and how didthe notion of “gods” fit into it? Why should such “gods” be worshipped byhuman beings at all - particularly if they were malignant? Was HPLexpressing contempt for humanity by illustrating its morbid desires for self-obliteration, or was he creating a more subtle and complex philosophy?From Lovecraft’s own letters and non-fiction essays, it is evident thathe drew a sharp line between mythology and reality. In a 1935 letter to EmilPetaja, for example, he disavowed his belief in any form of the supernaturaland argued that the universe is simply a product of random force/mattermutations.Why, I wondered, would so adamant a materialist devote so mucheffort to the creation of a new body of literary mythology? Obviously not formoney, nor did HPL vaunt his stories for their artistic merit. The general- 1094 -explanation given out by the “Lovecraft Circle” - that he wrote for personalamusement and with at least some commercial ambition - is unconvincing[at least to me]. There is an atmosphere of sincerity in his stories thattranscends mere yarn-spinning. In fact, it is this very quality of authorialconviction which so markedly separates HPL from his disciples andimitators, whose stories, clever as they may be, are instantly identifiable as“just stories”. [Exceptions are authors such as Colin Wilson who use thetechnique of the Lovecraftian novel to illustrate and explore their ownphilosophical hypotheses.]This quality of conviction in Lovecraft’s “fiction” cannot beoveremphasized. It is the secret of that author’s phenomenal popularitywith both readers and would-be imitators. It also explains why most ofthose same imitators have failed to gain equal popularity. A similar qualityof authorial conviction distinguishes Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings from itsmany imitations, it may be added.Another unique characteristic of Lovecraft’s stories is theirextraordinary detail and precision from a scientific and scenic standpoint.Linguistic dialects, historic data, geographic vistas, and abstract theoriesare refined so sharply as to reduce plots to secondary importance. [Only inThe Case of Charles Dexter Ward, I think, did HPL machine the plot itselfto comparable degree; the use of timed release of information, flashbacks,and plot groundwork in that novel is brilliant. Compare it to The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, in which the sequence of the various episodes isrelatively unimportant, the stress being on the visual imagery itself.]The paradox of Lovecraft’s personal materialism and vivid writing wasprofoundly disturbing to me. And it smacked of inconsistency as well: IfHPL were so firmly convinced that the universe and its contents are merelymechanical, how could he account for his mental visualization of entities,objects, and processes outside that mechanical order? [Consider especiallythe philosophical sequences in The Silver Key and Through the Gates of theSilver Key.] Are not such concepts so alien to the integral symmetry ofnatural law as to truthfully be identified as violations of them?Perhaps the answer is that Lovecraft indeed spoke his true mind in hisstories - but not relative to the objective, natural world which our sensesimpress upon us. Rather his focus is inward - towards the power of thehuman mind to conceive and create non-natural phenomena and to imbuethose phenomena with subjective existence. The subjective idealismtheories of J.G. Fichte, the objective idealism “sequel” of Hegel, and themore recent phenomenology of Husserl [cited by Colin Wilson, whose own- 1095 -Outsider swings a mean existentialist club] are pertinent references. Suchan interpretation would account for the gripping realism of the Lovecraftstories, while not contradicting their author’s contention that they were notto be taken as portraits of objective reality.I decided to put my theory to the test by constructing a Lovecraftianritual that would stimulate the non-natural, creative/visualizing abilities ofthe human mind. I began to rough out the text for the “Ceremony of theNine Angles”. And immediately I was aware that something else was wrong.If the ceremony were theoretically designed by humans for humans toillustrate veneration of a Lovecraftian god, then the English language [orany other human tongue] would not be inappropriate. But the basicassumption of the Lovecraft mythology was that such gods - or, one mightsay, “god-entities of the subconscious mind” - were mental creations priorto the development of logical reasoning processes per se: thespontaneous product of primeval, non-ordered high intelligence. [Anexcellent illustration of this was the uncannily-Lovecraftian monstercreated by the Id of Dr. Morbius in the 1956 film Forbidden Planet.]The single most essential feature of any civilization is its language.Once a system of communication has been established, all else follows; it issimply a matter of time. To approach that special quality of authenticityfound in Lovecraft’s own work, therefore, the “Ceremony of the NineAngles” would have to be composed in non-human language, illustratenon-human concepts, avoid objective patterns of logic, and bebewilderingly enigmatic in its overall purpose. At the same time therewould be no point in reducing the text to complete nonsense, else the“normal” reader would find it valueless as a practical tool of ceremonialmagic.So I set out to create a Lovecraftian language. The pattern, of course, isto be found in HPL’s famous incantation from The Call of Cthulhu:“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.” The expansion ofthis pattern into a linguistic base for a complete ritual text is not asdifficultas one might suspect: It is essentially a question of creating artificial wordsto match English words or phrases, which can be accomplished by somefairly random accordion-playing on a typewriter keyboard. Then a non-human quality to the vocal and mental/vocal rendition of the words iscreated by the juxtaposition of vowels, consonants, dashes, andapostrophes in such a way as to impair - but not entirely prevent - humanutterance.- 1096 -Linguistic consistency was achieved by the manufacture of artificialdeclensions and conjugations for certain key nouns and verbs, as well as byconsistent use of repeated words and phrases throughout the text. Especialcare was taken with regard to the appearance and sound of specific terms ofunusual importance, and I was enough of a prankster to lace the text withobscure references, hidden meanings, and outright satires. A very few ofthese have been guessed, but a complete decoding has never been printed.Even Anton LaVey is unaware of this “ritual behind the ritual”. Nyctalopsreaders, then, may be the first to really understand this particular duet of“nameless rites”.[Parenthetically I may add that the controversial English magicianAleister Crowley used a similar language-creation technique for some of hisown incantations, based upon the Enochian or Angelic language appearingin the diaries of John Dee. Crowley’s task was somewhat easier than mine,since the 19 Enochian Keys already provided him with a substantialvocabulary and some grammatical technique. He had merely to cataloguethe words, create a few new ones as desired, and build his new incantationsfrom this “dictionary”. To see how the original Enochian underwentperiodic revision, see [in this order] Meric. Casaubon’s John Dee’s Actionswith Spirits, Israel Regardie’s The Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley’sEquinox, and Anton LaVey’s Satanic Bible.]The English translation to the “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” isdesigned to be read prior to the conduct of the ceremony itself, so thatparticipants will be aware of the concepts actually enunciated in the"},{"pageContent":"Yuggothic tongue during the ceremony proper. Such knowledge, combinedwith the emotional, non-human effects of the spoken Yuggothic, brings theritual to its full effect.The setting and visual preparation of the participants per theinstructions are equally important. What many armchair magicians do notunderstand is that, not unlike Shakespeare’s plays, magical rituals are bothunimpressive and impotent on paper. They must be performed in the flesh.Critics, novelists, and “students” rarely display the courage, energy, orintelligence necessary to achieve success with a magical ritual. And so theyhunch over their typewriters, glare at The Magus, The Sacred Magic ofAbra=Melin, or The Litany of Ra, and denounce it as superstitiousnonsense. Therein they demonstrate their own sophistry - and guaranteethat their writings will never evoke the power of conviction so easilyachieved by H.P. Lovecraft.- 1097 -The “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” took about two months to research,write, and revise. Some sequences looked satisfactory on paper, yet failed inpractice. The completed ceremony was sent to Anton LaVey in SanFrancisco, and a short time later he asked me to balance the “fire” impact ofthe text with a “water” ritual invoking Cthulhu. Since the Yuggothiclanguage was now ready at hand, it was but a week’s work to provide the“Call to Cthulhu”.Before embarking upon a decoding of the two ritual texts, I should liketo respond to four provocative points raised by Mr. Miller in his Nyctalopsarticle:The comment in my Lovecraft introduction in the Satanic Ritualsabout “Lovecraft being aware of rites not quite ‘nameless’ … often identicalto actual ceremonial procedure … around the turn of the last century” wasadded to my text by Anton LaVey prior to the book’s publication. As far as Iam concerned, it is an ungrounded statement. From HPL’s letters andconversations we know of the impact that his “dream-ritual” experiencesexerted on his fictional themes, but nowhere is there evidence that hisstories were influenced by contemporary magical societies. In fact he wasopenly contemptuous of both the magical literature available in his day [seehis letter to Willis Conover of 7/29/36] and individuals who avowedthemselves practicing magicians [letter to Emil Petaja of 3/6/35].Had he taken the trouble to look beyond the books of Rohmer, Waite,and Levi to Crowley’s Equinox, Casaubon’s John Dee’s Actions with Spirits,or Budge’s compilations of Egyptian magical texts, he might well havemodified his literary view. And had he actually investigated the practices ofthe A.'.A.'., the Green Pang & 14K Triads of China, or the Thule Gesellschaftof pre-Nazi Germany, his scorn for practicing magicians also might haveabated.I think we can assume that Lovecraft’s prejudice in these areas derivesfrom his contact with Harry Houdini, whose disgust with the fraudulentseances and stage-magic of the day was scarcely a secret. In the case of theman who once gave thanks for the mind’s inability to correlate all itscontents, it is perhaps equally merciful that a brain of his calibre was notexposed to the exhilarating stimuli of actual Black Magic. Else HPL mighthave left mankind a legacy far more estranged from “normalcy” than hisworks of fiction.Mr. Miller questions my statement that “servility is definitely lacking ina Lovecraftian ceremony” [as opposed to the climate of conventionalreligious observances]. He argued that “most of the followers of those- 1098 -[HPL] gods were degenerate and ignorant”. In point of fact the disciples ofthe Old Ones may be separated into two categories - the“intellectuals” (Curwen, Ward, Carter, Blake, Akeley, Peasley, “I”, etc.) andthe “subhumans” (the ignorant Untermenschen useful only for slavery orfood).If this brings to mind the Nazis’ similar classification of humanity, it isneither accidental nor surprising; see chapter #6 of de Camp’s HPLbiography for a candid expose of HPL’s racial beliefs. The most revealingstory along this line is probably The Horror at Red Hook. To makeLovecraft acceptable to his egalitarian public, August Derleth did what hecould to play down his idol’s elitism, but Lovecraft’s letters suggest that hetook this opinion with him to his grave. “Cursed are they who voiceinconvenient truths, for they shall be given hemlock to drink … or simply be‘reinterpreted’ by others.”It is a little easier to deal with Mr. Miller’s question concerning the oldSatanic concept of “indulgence”. Within the Church of Satan, “indulgence”was not equated with excess per se. The point was not to get sick by eatinglike a hog or to become delirious from a week’s worth of orgiastic sex.Rather it was to attain some concrete understanding of actual extremes inorder to make a reasoned approach to an Aristotelian Mean.As for “where the beginning came from”, that question was notaddressed in either the Satanic Bible or the Satanic Rituals, but it wasdealt with in an article entitled “Genesis II” that I wrote for the C/Snewsletter Cloven Hoof in 1972. For an answer to the problem of how“something may be created out of nothing … and why”, may I suggestHannes Alfven’s Worlds-Antiworlds: Antimatter in Cosmology. As to thecreation of intelligence against this tableau, that has been addressed intexts not available outside the Temple of Set.… Now to ye decipher’g of ye Abominations from ye Outer Spheres:The Ceremony of the Nine AnglesThe “nine angles” are the 5 points of the pentagram and the 4 edge-angles of the phi-trapezoid (defined by the pentagon within thepentagram). The pentagram and the phi-trapezoid may thus be consideredboth complementary and mutually-definitive.Theoretical setting for the ceremony is the “King’s Chamber” of theGreat Pyramid of Giza, a structure whose true function has not beenconclusively explained to date. The King’s Chamber possesses- 1099 -inconspicuous, astronomically-oriented light channels from the exterior ofthe Pyramid.This environment may be approximated in a ritual chamber throughthe mirroring of starlight from appropriate constellations. Where this is notpossible, ionization of the atmosphere via electronic apparatus or indirectultraviolet light may be employed.Distortion of recognizable human features may be accomplished bymakeup, masks, or face-coverings of nylon mesh. The individual and groupimpact of such distortion must be experienced to be appreciated.The Sign of the Horns is an identifying signal among Satanists, given byclenching the fist above the body, with the index and little fingers extended,to symbolize the horns of the Goat of Mendes - patron of the ancientEgyptian cult-center of Ba-neb-Tett, later corrupted into “Baphomet”, theSatanic goat.The following terms are defined in the order in which they appear inthe text.Ki’q:“Honor”.Az-Athoth:“Az” from the traditional “Aztlan” mother country ofthe Aztecs/Plato’s Atlantis; hence “Az-Athoth”becomes “Thoth (Egyptian god of magic and wisdom)of Atlantis”.El-aka gryenn’h:“World of Horrors”. “El” from the primitive name forthe Judaic/Christian god, “gryenn’h” from “grin”,originally a facial expression of fear (bared teeth)rather than merriment. Consider the “death grin”explored in Sardonicus, The Man Who Laughs, etc.Phragn:Linguistic root for concepts of being/existing, adaptedfrom the Latin fragmentum, something that is brokenor incomplete.Fhagn:Root for concepts of night and dreaming, takendirectly from the HPL incantation.Zyb’nos:“Bond”, from the Latin bini.- 1100 -Vuy-kin’eh:“v-” prefix denotes possessive case in Yuggothic.“ K i n ” ( a n g l e ) f r o m t h e G r e e k r o o t f o r“kinetic” [contained] energy.Z’j-m’h:A non-human rendering of “demon” from the GreekDaimon (“divine spirit” or “tutelary divinity”), latercorrupted into a Hellish term by superstitiousChristians. A not-inappropriate honorific for the OldOnes.Quz:Root for concepts of death, from the Latin quo/quis(who).Kh’reng:Root for blackness or darkness.Ty’h nzal’s:“Hounds”, from Frank Belknap Long’s The Hounds ofTindalos. LaVey altered my original Englishtranslation to “night gaunts”, apparently not seeing thephonetic tie and evidently thinking that “hounds”would seem less impressive [or might clash withanother text in the Satanic Rituals].Zhri:“Cry”, taken from “zhro” of the Descending Nodeincantation in Charles Dexter Ward.Naagh-:Root for “Abyss”, adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien’sNâzgul and Nâz- prefix. [Translation at one pointaltered to “grotto” by LaVey.]F’ung:Root for “speak/speech”, being a new translation of thetitle Fungi from Yuggoth.Urenz:“Prince” from the hieroglyphic ur (great man orprince). Note the modifier “black” from the consonantsof “kh’reng” (darkness).Aem’nh:“Father(s)”, from the name of the Egyptian ram-godAmon.- 1101 -W’ragn:To laugh, scream, or sing [more or less equivalent froma Gr. Old One standpoint!], from “rage”.W’hrengo:Terror/delight and fear/ecstasy. The notion of theblending of diametric opposites is crucial to this ritual.See passages concerning the Dweller from A. Merritt’sMoon Pool - based in Ponape, the Micronesian modelfor HPL’s R’lyeh.Kyno:“Will”, treated as a variation of kinetic energy.Hu-ehn:“Name” from “hue” (color) from The Color Out ofSpace.Y’goth-e:From “Yuggoth”, here identified with the Left-HandPath of Black Magic.Kyl’d zhem’n:“Those without horns”, from the Satanic term formankind: the goat without horns.Phragn’ka phragn: “I am that I am.” The first words of Amon/Shub-Niggurath upon evocation and thus a hint as to whoreally addressed Moses from the burning bush …Syn:From “sin”, here used for both “time” and “dimension”as an integral continuum.The First Angle identifies infinity and the concept of Azathoth.The Second Angle identifes Yog-Sothoth.Zaan:“Plane”, a tribute to HPL’s magical violinist.The Third Angle identifies Nyarlathotep. With three angles a trianglebecomes possible. Consider the dream-origins of Nyarlathotep, the poemand prose-fragment concerning him, and the triangular emblem andsymbolism of Ra and the Heliopolis cult of Egypt. The Ra-triangle laterbecame the symbol of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and itsderivative Orders during the Æon of Horus prior to the Age of Satan.- 1102 -Zhem’nfi:“Ram of the Sun” (Amon-Ra). The light of the Sun isthe “brilliance of the Nine Angles”.A building constructed with five trihedrons is a pyramid, referring in thiscase to the orginal use of the Great Pyramid and other non-mortuarypyramidal structures.The Seal is again the pentagram, intrinsically defining the phi-trapezoid.The “sleep of the Dæmons in symmetry” refers to the destruction of theEgyptian initiatory tradition by Judaism/Christianity. It vanquished the“five” (the visible tradition), but not the “four” (the secret tradition = theOrder of the Trapezoid and the Shining Trapezohedron) or the “nine” (theCouncil of Nine/Nine Unknown - governors of the Church of Satan and nowof the Temple of Set).The Seventh Angle identifies the downfall of Christianity heralded by theseven-pointed star of Babalon [of Aleister Crowley’s Order of the Silver Star(A.'.A.'.)].The Eighth Angle identifies the Masters of the A.'.A.'., the C/S, and now theTemple of Set, who have attained to knowledge of the City of the Pyramidsand raise the truncated pyramid - the Great Pyramid restored to anastronomical and communicative function - the Great Trapezohedron.The Ninth Angle identifies the Black Flame spoken of in the Diabolicon. Itwill be seen that the Yuggothic phrase for the “Seal of Nine” translatesphonetically to the previously-enigmatic YANKEE ROSE at the end of theSatanic Bible.The Call to CthulhuIn diametric contrast to the Ceremony of the Nine Angles, this ritualemphasizes primitive concepts by ordinarily-clothed people in a “wild”location. Hence there are strong lycanthropic undertones. The bonfire,torches, and unorganized assembly of the participants all add to thisatmosphere.The identifying medallion (inspired by the star-stones of ancient Mnar)is not to protect them from Cthulhu; it is to protect them from one- 1103 -another. The rationale behind this will become evident from an actualcelebration of the ritual.The theme of the “Call to Cthulhu” is that of a “casting back” throughcollective, “racial” memory to the rupture of mankind from the beasts ofnature.The Eternal Serpent: translation of the hieroglyphic Set-heh (“EternalSet”) in the serpent-personification of that entity. See also JamesThomson’s A Voice from the Nile. [Thomson also authored The City ofDreadful Night, quoted elsewhere in the Satanic Rituals.]Cylth:“Deep Ones”, a racial name derived from “Cthulhu”.The names of Cthulhu are those of water-dæmons and serpent-monstersfrom a variety of mythological traditions. They are followed by HPL’sfamous incantation from The Call of Cthulhu.Y’gth:Used here in the “planetary” sense as “Yuggoth”; inview of the unsophistication of the ceremony asopposed to the Ceremony of the Nine Angles, thissimple reference is appropriate.K’heh:Again from heh, the hieroglyphic term for “eternity”.The Cthulhu-entity was able to attain the Earth-dimensions via the angularenvironment of the Messenger Nyarlathotep, hence mention of the ThirdAngle.Here the Hounds of Tindalos are referred to as “jackals”, identifying themwith Anubis, originally the “son” of the triad Set/Nepthys/Anubis and aguide of the intelligence in non-“living” dimensions.Here the words for “death” and “sleep” have been taken from the HPLincantation. The “laughing one” is Azathoth.The “god of death” is the Judaic/Christian god who stresses abstinence inlife in exchange for reward after death.- 1104 -The “god of dying” is Asar or Osiris, the original model for YHVH, whosecult in Egypt was based upon the presumed glory and promise of the dyingprocess itself.“Death without sleep” is the total extinction of the personality, either beforeor after “physical” death. Death with sleep refers to Cthulhu’s own Undeadlife, not unlike that of the traditional blood-vampire.Here “Old One” is translated using the term “father” (aem’nh).The awakening of the cylth after the reign of the god of death refers to thecoming of the Age of Satan in 1966.The extinction of the angles of the watery Abyss refers to the Childhood’sEnd of mankind. Appeals to primitive, racial memory are no longernecessary, as the capacity for higher intelligence is now dawning among thecylth. A concept only roughed out within the Church of Satan, this has nowbecome the Setamorphosis of the Elect of the Temple of Set.V’yn’khe rohz:“By the Seal of Nine”.Some concluding remarks may be in order. Even from this abbreviatedscanning of the two rituals, it will be evident that the translations andexplanations often “open more doors than they close”. This is bound to befrustrating to those who seek instantly-finite answers to all phenomenawithin their range of perception.I must answer that persons so inclined are rarely qualified for thepractice of Black Magic, and that the “Ceremony of the Nine Angles” andthe “Call to Cthulhu” are deliberately designed to be devices for operativemagic. The literary aficionado will invariably feel more secure with thepassive stories of the “Lovecraft Circle” of fiction authors.For those cylth who become “restless” after this cursory exposure to thetwo ceremonies and begin to wonder whether they really “work” … there’sonly one way for you to find out. I’a ry’gzengrho!- 1105 -Appendix 75: “The Secrets of Life and Death”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #V-1, January-February VIII/1973Do you remember that scene in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Manwhere Bela Lugosi as the Monster shows a feverishly-excited Lon Chaney,Jr. the concealed hiding-place of Dr. Frankenstein’s famous professionaldiary? “The Secrets of Life and Death,” recited Lawrence Talbot almostreverently, and we all wondered [between mouthfuls of popcorn] whatmight have been contained in such a book.What obsessions would have motivated a real Victor Frankenstein toembark upon his rather grisly course of anatomical research? And, if thenotorious notebook contained only an electrochemical method forgenerating artificial life, why the pointed reference to death in the title aswell? Perhaps our Frankenstein, having satisfied himself that “divine” lifewas no more than a mechanical phenomenon, might have recorded somerather revolutionary comments concerning existing attitudes towards lifeand death. After all, according to Shelley’s novel, the doctor was given tospeculation.All this, admittedly, would have been a little thick for a torchlight-parade horror movie. The book made no further appearances, and theaudience settled down to enjoy the latest Elektrischen Vorspiele in theFrankenstein laboratory and the subsequent difference of opinion betweenMr. Talbot and his revived rival.And yet - decades after that film was made - it is that odd episodeconcerning the book that remains foremost in our memory. And so in thisissue we thought we might take a fresh look at life and death.Satanists are perennially interested in factors which influence humanmotivation - not only why people act in the way that they do, but whethersuch actions are materially justified to begin with. To put it another way,is the goal really worth the trouble [presuming that it is a practical goal atall]? 500 years from now, will either the ends or the means really matter toanyone?Every individual, upon scrutiny, may be seen to possess a score ofpersonal motives: wealth, political power, social admiration, sexualnotoriety, etc. But is there a common thread underlying latent humanambition - a sort of “prime motive” that inspires, to some degree, our moreimmediate and apparent ambitions?- 1106 -Author Alan Harrington believes there is. In The Immortalist (NewYork: Avon, 1969), a book that major literary critics have lauded as beingamong the most important books of our time, he advances the theory thatdeath - or rather the fear of it - is responsible for an astonishing number ofman’s conscious decisions. Once our basic needs of subsistence have beenseen to, he argues, we all devote our efforts to cheating, postponing, orrationalizing the eventual extinction that awaits us at the conclusion of ourlife-span. We may do this through theology (which generally promisesimmortality in some semblance to adherents), through publicity (whichcreates a record of the individual enduring past his natural death), andthrough philosophy (which reconciles us to the limitations of our naturalexistence and prepares us psychologically for the Great Black Sack which isto be thrust over our heads).Having attained for himself many facets of control over nature, man isalmost powerless to prevent or even postpone the steady decay andultimate ruin of his own body. This is all the more frustrating since, forperhaps the first time in history, life is becoming rather pleasant for asignificant segment of the world’s population [and most particularly for theSatanists!].The continuing breakdown of established religion accentuates thisfrustration, Harrington argues, inasmuch as most thinking persons nowacknowledge that they have little real chance of living on beyond the grave.Unbelievers pronounce upon themselves, in effect, a total death sentence.Thus they - we - seize eagerly upon every new device, religious orotherwise, that may refute this disillusionment and offer renewed hope.In past ages there were gods who tantalized men with the prospect ofimmortality, an essentially divine attribute. Today the gods are stillflaunting the gift, but now their names are History, Success, Statistics, andLuck. What is it about a famous film star, for example, that evokes analmost worshipful adulation from the masses? Is it merely the luxury of hisor her life style? There are lawyers and accountants who possess greaterriches.Perhaps, however, it is the implication that, by being preserved on film,records, or tape, the star has achieved at least a surrogate immortality thatis denied to the man-on-the-street.Harrington draws the analogy of a “great record book” in which we alldesire to be entered, to assure ourselves that there has in fact been somepoint to our lives. Consider the posthumous “day of judgment” common toall afterlife-espousing religions in one form or another. We wish to be- 1107 -counted, included, and accepted by the giant computer of God/History. Theterrible alternative - that there is simply no one there to give a damn - isprofoundly unacceptable to the human ego. We are, to be blunt, tooconceited!One [and perhaps the earliest] approach to the problem has been art.According to William Faulkner, quoted in The Immortalist:Life is motion … The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life,by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when astranger looks at it, it moves again since it is life.Since man is mortal, the only immortality possible for him is to leavesomething behind him that is immortal since it will always move.This is the artist’s way of scribbling “Kilroy was here” on the wall of thefinal and irrevocable oblivion through which he must some day pass.In almost every social context there is an attitude either announced orassumed towards death. One particularly fascinating example of this occursduring wartime. Suddenly it is man, not God or nature, who administersthe Fourth Dimension. Normal time-passage is suspended for all intents,and political/military commanders become “gods” who dictate who shalllive and who shall die. For a moment at least, man has succeeded in castinghimself into the most envied role of a god.The exhilarating sense of greater-than-human power is not easilyrelinquished … which might explain why wars, once started, have atendency to perpetuate themselves until the soldiers of one side simplyrefuse to fight any further. Indeed the lessons learned by Alexander andNapoleon - to name but two who drank too deeply of this particular Kheft -might well be studied by certain addicts in our own era.And why the public’s fascination - from the Roman games in theColosseum to The Untouchables on modern television - for violence?Perhaps it is the same lure to power over death, made available to theaverage man through fantasy projection. You be the judge [literally].Harrington’s novel approach to the concept of evil bears bothexamination and criticism. His ideas are well presented, but they proceedfrom the premise that “evil” is invariably destructive. He describes “evil” asthe intent to circumvent or conquer death by degrading or destroying thelives of others. Under this basic definition he lists four sources of evilbehavior: paranoia, god-imitation, boredom, and rage.Paranoia accounts for the greatest number of evil manifestations. Itstems from a fear that others are conspiring against one’s life or well-being.- 1108 -But in a deeper sense it derives from man’s feeling that all of nature is“conspiring” against him as a species - that he and his separate (Satanic)consciousness constitute a “disease” or “fault” which must be eliminated ifthe Universe is to be restored to its “perfect” order.The phenomenon of god-imitation occurs when nebulous individualsritually “command” the forces of life and death. The military example givenearlier would fall under this heading. So would such artistic parallels asVoodoo zombies, the Golem, The Picture of Dorian Grey, andFrankenstein. And so would sadists [who become caricature gods] andmasochists [who yield to their consuming need for control by gods].Boredom is frustration due to lack of sufficient stimulus for personalamusement through “normal” methods. It sanctions horror in order torelieve monotony. This is possibly why children thrive on monster moviesin our era of media-saturation. And it may help to explain the Hellfire Club,the Luciferians, de Sade, Giles de Laval, Crowley, and Nero.The fourth category of evil is rage due to a perceived helplessness inthe face of death, with no god apparent to explicitly save or condemn thevictim/human. Hence the subject behaves in a monstrous or berserkfashion to “force” the deity to reveal itself in the form of retribution. Thisisparticularly evident in the political arena; witness Caligula, Hitler, Stalin,and Rasputin.Our criticism of Harrington’s fourfold analysis of evil stems, as wenoted earlier, from his rather negative definition of “evil” as a disposition ofthe personality. If one should presuppose, after the fashion of the SatanicBible, that “evil” is more accurately a “super-awareness of life”, fouralternative categories appear to balance Harrington’s:Paranoia… SatanismGod-imitation… DivinityBoredom… AmusementRage… CuriosityWhile the paranoiac fears imaginary persecution, the Satanistrecognizes a basic interpersonal hostility as essential to all human society.Satanism, among other things, involves the art of manipulating thishostility for one’s personal ends.The difference between god-imitation and divinity should be self-evident: Divinity is the actual assumption of godhood, not a pretension toit. The true Black Magician subjectively commands all the powers accorded- 1109 -a god. See in particular Cavendish’s The Black Arts for a discussion of thispoint.As for boredom, it is the destiny of the cretin who assumes that,because he understands all he has been taught, there is nothing else worthknowing. The Satanic approach to conventional disciplines is that they offerexistential amusement. The magician, who is in a position to “step outside”of society and observe its antics with bemused objectivity, can tacitlyeducate himself by formulating and then applying standard behavioralpatterns. This system includes personality analysis as well. Note, forexample, the “color wheel” inside the cover of the Compleat Witch.Finally rage [which, ultimately, is nothing more than a child’s temper-tantrum in disguise] is replaced in the Satanic intellect by curiosity andrestlessness. It is a motivating force driving the magician to exploreconcepts, creations, and behaviorisms which have not been accepted bysociety as a whole.To put it in a nutshell … in Satanism: Evil = Maturity.Against the overall tableau of life and death, the character of Satanfigures most prominently. In any number of legends the ArchDæmonsuffers - sometimes quite horribly, such as in the case of Prometheus - butin no instance, including the mythos of the Judaic/Christian Bible, does heever die! Nor do his followers, in the Golden Bough tradition, slay himperiodically for their own salvation [as do Christians and other death-worshippers]. Note the following from Harrington’s chapter “Satan, OurStandard-Bearer”:Satan, then, has consistently proven to be our unacknowledged leader inthe pursuit of immortality. We turn to him and recoil from him, as we are atvarious times proud of and repelled by ourselves. He is grand and mean, tragicand comic, charming company and the embodiment of loathsome temptation,depending on our state of mind. He is what we are, want most, what weadmire and also most fear in ourselves when we consider our qualifications fordivinity. Hence his [our] many forms and disguises.If one accepts the premise that an escape from aging and death is man’smost compelling desire, Harrington identifies two optional courses ofaction: (1) Submerge the entire problem through fantasy, rationalization, orreligious/philosophical conditioning; or (2) Organize an international effortfor the development of new medical techniques to arrest and finallyeliminate the aging process. This latter alternative is what Harringtonrecommends. But it is perhaps here that his previously dispassionate logic- 1110 -falls victim to excessive optimism. He assumes that a transcultural altruismmay overcome man’s overwhelmingly bovine inertia. The Cloven Hoof failsto find much in the way of precedent for such an assumption.Until medical science can discover and apply the means for arrestingthe aging process, Harrington advances cryonics as an interim measure.Cryonics is a process whereby the bodies of individuals who have died viaaccident or disease are frozen in the hope that they may be revived at somefuture time. Harrington admits that the process is presently so crude as tooffer very little hope to the would-be immortalist for a damage-free revival,but he argues that it is at least better than nothing [an observation of AntonLaVey’s as well!] and that the technique may be improved with time. Froma physiological standpoint cryonics has certainly met with its share ofskepticism. On the other hand, so did the ideas of Columbus and Galileo.The deathless utopia that Harrington envisions is more or less as rosyas are most other utopias, with an intellectually unpressured Homo Sapiensfree to taste an endless variety of pleasures at his leisure. Children would beadmitted to the new society via a carefully controlled quota system, andthus they would receive unusually attentive care and appreciation. Thosewho eventually tire of consciousness could elect to sleep via suspendedanimation for ten, one hundred, or even one thousand years, awakening toa new era and new - or perhaps the same! - acquaintances.Let us assume for the moment that medical science succeeds indeveloping an anti-aging “vaccine”. Could it be produced in sufficientquantity for the entire population of our planet? And be administered in anorderly fashion? We rather doubt it. In the rush to be saved, there would beextortion, rioting, and perhaps even genocide-by-exclusion [which wouldnot bear the onus of outright murder]. And then there might be somepersons or social groups who would refuse the treatment for philosophicalor religious reasons. Would their families be condemned to gradualextermination through an almost zero birthrate plan? As you can see, thereare quite a few heads on this particular hydra.Even were we to go one step further and assume that the transition toan immortalist utopia could be made without catastrophe, just how idyllicwould the new society be? There has never yet been a governmental systemthat did not eventually fall victim to internal decadence and corruption. Todate even the most ironclad despotisms have been limited by the lifespan oftheir rulers. Consider the prospect of a deathless Stalin, or of a collective1984-esque clique that would endure for countless centuries. And offenders- 1111 -against the society could be awarded a new type of capital punishment:eternal imprisonment [or torture] without hope of death.And finally there is the great paradox of human immortality. If the timepressure of the normal life span were to be eliminated altogether, would notthe individual as an entity become quite pointless? In the words of Hegel:Without death individuals are reduced to the status of mere modes ofone infinite. One has individuality precisely because one dies.Time as we know it would lose all meaning. There would be no urgencyto any social project, no impetus to any thought, no cause for movement.Ours would become a planet of procrastination. Harrington paints thepicture of an intellectual renaissance, but we suspect he gives the Roobs ofour civilization a bit too much credit.Must we say, then, that human immortality is impractical even if itproves to be scientifically possible? Not necessarily. One of the nice thingsabout the future is that it is an unknown quantity. Data which areunavailable to us in VIII may be common knowledge in IX. Breakthroughsmay be made not only in cryonics and preventative medicine but intechniques of political administration and genetic control. And what wedon’t know in IX, we may know in XIX, XXIX, or CIX. Therein lies thepromise of the Satanic Age.- 1112 -- 1113 -Appendix 76: “O.K., So We Have to Say SomethingAbout the ‘Witch Wagon’”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #IV-4, April VII/1972If you’re blind, deaf, or a hermit there’s a slight chance that you haven’theard about the Witch Wagon. It seems as though it’s made one out ofevery two papers across the country, and its most recent splash was in theMarch 13 edition of Time magazine.A San Diego outfit called Morris Cerullo World Evangelism, Inc. hasdispatched an anti-occult mobile unit to tour 45 cities in an effort to stemthe rising tide of diabolism. The van contains “examples of potions,Voodoo-oils, and paraphernalia of Satanic worship”, all of which wereassembled by a “research team” consisting of one evangelist, threereporters, and an “ex-high priest” of a southern California “Satanic” cult.All these quotation marks ought to give you a pretty good idea of ourcontempt for this enterprise. Far from being an accurate commentary onSatanism or witchcraft, it is the shameless attempt of an otherwise-unknown Bible-jock outfit to attract attention by capitalizing on the esotericglamor of Satanism. You are welcome to make our viewpoint known to yourlocal news-media should the Witch Wagon pass through your area.Obviously, were the Church of Satan to take official action of a publicnature against this tour, we would only lend dignity and credibility to itsridiculous displays. Hence members who encounter the Wagon are advisednot to reveal their factual affiliation with the Church - but rather to cross-examine and ridicule the “high priest” and his displays from a strictlyobjective basis. If you should see or hear specific references to the Churchitself, please send a detailed report to the Secretary of the Central Grotto inSan Francisco.To give you a quick idea of the intelligence of the ex-“H.P.”, a fellownamed Mike Warnke, we shall quote him: “It’s soul enslavement. You’dhardly believe it, but you’re capable of any deranged activity.” That alldepends, Mike, upon your point of view. We would be inclined to place theshoe on the other foot!By the way, we aren’t the only ones excited about the Witch Wagon.Leo Louis Martello’s WICA Newsletter has lashed out against it withconsiderable vehemence, calling for a “MORAL CRAFT CRUSADE” todiscredit the tour. Since the White witches frantically disavow anyconnection with Satanism, we fail to see their motive in raising a rumpus in- 1114 -this instance. Oh, well - nothing like a little comedy to brighten up thespring.- 1115 -Appendix 77: “‘Sympathy for the Devil’Avowed by Satanist LaVey”- by Alan WhitesideGuardsman #75-3, City College of San Francisco, October 12, 1972“Most people indulge daily in the seven deadly sins. All of the sevensins (greed, pride, envy, anger, gluttony, lust, and sloth) lead to physical,mental, or emotional gratification,” stated Karla LaVey, City Collegestudent, criminology major - and Satanist. “If it were not for these things,which people do naturally, the Christian church would not be in businesstoday. The church survives on guilt,” she continued. “As long as all aresinners, they will all go to Hell - if there is indeed a Hell - so why not meetall your friends there?”Karla’s father is the High Priest and founder of the Church of Satan,Anton Szandor LaVey. “The man,” she informs, “who has brought Satanismaboveground and who has now been called the worldwide leader of theSatanic movement.” Satanism as conceived by the Church of Satanoriginated in San Francisco in 1966 on April 30, the Eve of May(Walpurgisnacht), and what was originally a small gathering has nowbecome a worldwide organization.As for why people are turning to new religions, Karla believes that“people are no longer learning from their old religion. If you aren’t learningfrom it, why continue? The old one no longer fits today’s standards.” AntonLaVey’s philosophy first reached the public through his book The SatanicBible and his later publication The Compleat Witch, or What to Do WhenVirtue Fails. His newsletter The Cloven Hoof is sent to Satanists in local“Grottos”.To Karla, Satanism is “a way of life, though more a philosophy than areligion”. It has also developed into an occupation for her, as she now giveslectures in the Bay Area. Karla talked about vampirism last semester to aCCSF English class, and she remembers, “They loved to hear about theunknown.”She has also lectured at the University of Santa Clara and the CaliforniaState Universities of Chico and San Francisco on such subjects as Satanism,“lesser magic”, and Dracula author Bram Stoker. Ms. LaVey will be onradio KGO Friday the 13th to talk about superstitions. “All good Christianswant to go to Heaven, and they are all in such a hurry to get there. It’s like afreeway on a Sunday afternoon, and everyone is in a rush to get to the same- 1116 -place,” Karla added. “No one wants to go to Hell, so the path is left clear,cool, and breezy.”She generally agrees with the definition of Satanism which was part ofthe cover story in the June 19 Time magazine: Satan being a symbol ofman’s self-gratifying ego but not a supernatural being. Satanism is basedpartly on science and philosophy and could also be called “humanism orAyn Rand with ritual”, thinks Ms. LaVey. “One part respectability and nineof outrageousness” [her father says in the Satanic Bible] is the formula foran organization to be called a church and to be successful. The church is a“getting together of people who think the same way and to enhance magicalability, which most people have but don’t know how to use.” “Magic” isdefined as the ability to change situations or events into agreement withone’s own will.Ms. LaVey, a thin - almost fragile - woman with soft, black hair, doesnot believe in drug use because “drugs hamper magical ability, and youmust have control over all emotions”. To the Satanists, God is seen as abalancing force in nature that makes everything happen, but this force isseen as too impersonal to care about happiness or suffering on this dustspeck called Earth. Hoping and praying are thought of as negative feelings.“There can be no room for doubt,” Karla contends. “With positive thinkingand positive action, you know everything is going to work.”The casting of spells on persons is a ritual in the Satanic Church, butthese spells are irreversible and are used in only the most extreme ofcircumstances. As for astrology, Karla believes that people make theirastrology for themselves; that is, once people find out what theirastrological characteristics are, they tend to act them out. The mostimportant (highest) of all Satanic holidays is one’s own birthday, andanother is of course Halloween. The first [of nine] Satanic Statementspreaches that we should indulge, not abstain; so Karla advises: “As long asyou have only one life, live it to the fullest.”- 1117 -Appendix 78: “Those Who Seek Shall Find”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #V-2, March-April VIII/1973Perhaps you were over at a friend’s house for supper, and in due coursethe conversation drifted around to Satanism. You were beginning to discussthe Enochian Keys with your host and his wife, when suddenly their seven-year-old kid breaks in with, “Who’s Enoch?”Everything stops dead. Come to think of it, who (or what) is Enoch?How did the Keys get his name, when they were supposedly formulated byJohn Dee and Edward Kelly? And how is it that a dialect is named after himas well? All these thoughts go through your mind in about 15 seconds,together with several uncomplimentary ideas concerning the kid with thebig mouth. The conversation is shot, and later you limp homeward with afixed resolve to identify this Enoch.You turn to the dictionary and find out that it’s someone who’s beencastrated. You don’t think that’s quite right, so you open your Satanic Bibleto pages #155-6. Only it transpires that the author desires you to search outthat particular information elsewhere. In desperation you blow the dust offyour copy of Izzy Regardie’s Golden Dawn, leafing through the pages untilyou locate his section on the Keys. [This time you really should haveknown better!] After struggling with over threescore pages of gobbledegookin which Frater Ad Majorem Adonai Gloriam and MacGregor Mathersenthusiastically hogtie the Keys in trivia, you are more confused than ever.Resigning yourself to a ruined evening, you say, “Oh, well, I might as wellread the Hoof that came in today.” And so the Sun comes out and the birdsbegin to sing, because yes, we are going to tell you about Mr. Enoch.Believe it or not, you already know who he is, but you may not knowthat you know it. This is because Enoch, the seventh master of the worldafter Adam in the Old Testament, is considered to be the Hebrewequivalent of the Phoenician Cadmus, the Greek Hermes, and the EgyptianThoth. As such he is the reputed author of the Tarot, the Cabala, and theapocryphal Book of Enoch. He receives only a brief mention in Genesis,where the fifth chapter recounts:And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: And Enochwalked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begatsons and daughters: And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty andfive years: And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.- 1118 -Big deal. So he was a long-lived sex maniac. Aren’t we all? But thenwhat else could you expect from such a lurid source? The Hoof will try to doa bit better. First let’s look at the Book of Enoch.The Book of Enoch comprises a part of what is generally calledApocalyptic literature. The Apocalyptists were a school of pre-RabbinicalJews who believed that the world was in such a hopeless mess as to beincurable by any of man’s efforts. [What would they think today?] It wasonly a question of time, they said, before God would schedule another GreatFlood, clean house, and have a third go at it. Their name - Apocalyptists -meant “revealers”, and they spent most of their time revealing this ratherpessimistic prediction to any & all who would listen.What they expected to accomplish we’re not quite certain, since itwould have been beside the point when the waters began to rise. Thus theApocalyptists were the first predestinarians, inasmuch as they believed thatthe progress of man was mapped by God from start to finish. They believedin the spirit of God’s law, not the letter. In this they differed from the othermajor branch of the Jewish faith, Pharisaism.The Apocalyptic literature is generally fixed to the period 200-150 BCE,which makes it comparatively recent. Thus its value lies not so much in itsown existence as in the possible significance of the old legends which wereincorporated into it.Most scholars agree that the Book of Enoch is the oldest of theApocalyptic works. It seems to have been written by a number of variousauthors, the earliest being a Jew from the Land of Dan in northernPalestine. The original text was probably written in either the Enochiandialect or Aramaic. Later it was translated into Greek and Latin, both ofwhich translations didn’t survive the eclipse of the Holy Roman Empire.The Greek version was translated into Ethiopian, however. It was thisdocument which was brought to light in our own time, when an explorernamed Bruce brought back a copy from Abyssinia (appropriately named!)in the year 1773 CE.This curious odyssey of the Book of Enoch has been remarked upon bymore than one student of ancient literature. It was to become a model, forinstance, for H.P. Lovecraft’s fabled Necronomicon, paralleling much of itscontent as well as its obscurity.In non-fiction it bears a strong resemblance to the Diabolicon of theChurch of Satan and to what is perhaps the single most powerful text tohave come down to us from ancient Egypt - the XVII Chapter of theEgyptian Book of the Dead. [The most complete version of this is included- 1119 -in the Turin Papyrus, XXVI Dynasty, in the Egyptian Museum at Turin,Italy. Its full title is “The Praises and Glorifyings of Coming Forth by Day”,and it is the only known Khemite work which proposes to explain the actualcreation of the cosmos. See The Book of the Dead by E.A. Wallis Budge foran excellent translation. It is essential to many Satanic ceremonies.]The Book of Enoch is sometimes referred to as “I Enoch” to distinguishit from “II Enoch”, or The Secrets of Enoch, a later work executed inSlavonic. The Book of Enoch contains six chapters:1. The Book of Enoch2. The Parables3. The Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries4. The Dream-Visions5. The Conclusion6. The Noah FragmentsFollowing is a synopsis of the more important parts of the entire work:1. The Book of Enoch: In a dream Enoch is asked to intercede for theso-called Watchers, a group of fallen Angels who departed from Heaven tomate with human females. The result of such unions were monstrous giantswho destroyed the Earth and indulged in cannibalism and the drinking ofblood. Enoch writes out the petition and receives his answer in the form ofvisions. The request is refused, and Enoch is instructed to tell the Watchers,“You have no peace.” The chief of the Watchers is Semjaza, identified withSatan.An account is then given of Enoch’s subsequent journeys throughcertain areas of Earth and Hell (Sheol). Worthy of note are his impressionsof the Heavenly Palace of Lucifer:And I went in til I drew nigh to a wall which is built of crystals andsurrounded by tongues of fire, and it began to affright me. And I went into thetongues of fire and drew nigh to a large house which was built of crystals. Thewalls of the house were like a tessellated floor of crystals, and its groundworkwas of crystal. Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and the lightnings,andbetween them were fiery Cherubim amidst a background of water. A blazingfire surrounded the walls, and its portals were covered with fire. And I enteredinto that house, and it was as hot as fire yet as cold as ice. There were nodelights of life therein. Fear covered me, and trembling gat hold of me. And Iquaked and trembled and fell down upon my face.Shortly thereafter Enoch witnesses the Black Flame:- 1120 -From thence I went to another place to the west of the ends of the Earth.And I saw a burning fire which ran without resting, and paused not from itscourse day or night but blazed without respite. And I asked, saying, “What isthis flame which burns unceasingly?” Then Raguel, one of the holy Angels whowas with me, said, “This is the darkish Fire in the West which persecutes allthe luminaries of Heaven.”2. The Parables: There are three of these, each having as its themethe destruction of injustice. For the first time in Hebraic literature,vengeance is promised on Earth - in this life - rather than in an afterlife. Inthe First Parable God - herein called the “Lord of Spirits” - and the ElectOne or “Son of Man” are identified. The four principal ArchAngels arenamed. The Second Parable speaks of the joy to be found in vengeance bythe righteous against their persecutors. This also is a somewhat peculiartheme for the Hebraic religion.The Third Parable is more or less a continuation of the Second, being acommentary upon the Day of Judgment. It is incomplete in the transcriptwhich has come down to us, however, since the theme has beenhaphazardly intermixed with references to the Noah legend.3. The Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries:And the Sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they donot advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity, but completethe years with perfect justice in 364 days.This is the keynote of this chapter - that the passage of time is to becalculated by the Sun, not the Moon. Quaintly enough, it is fairly obviousfrom the observations set forth in the rest of the chapter that the authorwas familiar with the actual solar year of 365-1/4 days! The erroneousstatement seems to stem from his reluctance to honor the “heathen”mathematics of the Egyptians, Sumerians, and Greeks. In any case he isdefinitely opposed to the Pharisaic system of reckoning time by the Moon.The chapter closes with yet another curious notation. It is that man’snatural sinfulness will cause the Sun and Moon to mislead him. Onewonders whether the Hebrew author indulged himself in a bit ofpropaganda against the various Sun- and Moon-worshipping cults of thetimes!4. The Dream-Visions: Here is recounted a contemporary history ofthe ancient nation of Israel. It is followed by 5. The Conclusion, whichpredicts the coming of a new kingdom - but on Earth, not in an afterlife.- 1121 -The destruction of the existing Earth and Heaven is foretold, followed bythe institution of a “new Heaven”.The final section of the book is 6. The Noah Fragments. As onemight expect, it is a narrative of the deluge, with nothing out of the ordinaryto distinguish it from more familiar versions of the story.Wherein lies the true importance of the Book of Enoch and its reputedauthor? To understand the answer, one must first appreciate the historicalpattern of Judaism. The Hebrew religion and its Christian successoroutpaced their rivals primarily because of the uniformity of their doctrines.Every Greek, Sumerian, and Egyptian god possessed his own priesthood,mythology, and lay following. Members of the populace were exposed tomany conflicting and competing versions of the same legends; hence therewas cause for confusion and disbelief [not to mention freedom of choice].Under the Jewish system, however, there was no room for doubt, andno alternative gods were tolerated. The only polytheistic impression left bythe older religions was that of Satan [and later of other Angelic andDæmonic personages].The Book of Enoch was the first and most positive statement of theSatanic forces acting within the framework of the Hebrew religioustradition. In many ways it constituted a direct and unmistakable threat tothe monotheistic trends within Judaism. And so it was denounced andsuppressed by Pharisaic supporters of the conventional Old Testament.Let us examine that Old Testament for a moment. Apart from Genesis(upon which the Hoof has already trod), the most significant components ofthis work are the Books of Moses. How much truth is there in the story ofMoses?Our response is: Not much. Aside from the Old Testament and otherHebrew works citing the Old Testament as their authority, there is noevidence at all that a person by the name of Moses ever existed, or thatany of the events in Exodus ever took place. The Hebrews soughtrefuge in Egypt at a time when famine and drought plagued Palestine. Butthere is no record that they were ever enslaved or mistreated en masse. TheEgyptians were in the habit of dealing quite harshly with rabble-rousers,however, and it is entirely possible that reprisals were taken against themore fanatic and intolerant Osiris/Jehovah elements.Khem was a nation of record-keepers. Even if one pharaoh suppressedan embarrassing fact, his successors were almost certain to comment uponit. [After all, it probably made them look better!] Even the most dedicatedcritics of Seti I and Rameses II, however, made no mention whatever of- 1122 -either Moses or the havoc he supposedly decided to wreak. Nor is there anyrecord of the destruction of an Egyptian army at the Red Sea. [Hadsomething like this actually occurred, incidentally, it probably would havemeant the instantaneous dethroning of Rameses. In fact he ruled with greathonor to a ripe old age.]If you thought you saw the real Mount Sinai in Cecil B. DeMille’s TheTen Commandments, think again. The mountain in question has neverbeen identified. And yet another interesting fact that we chanced uponwhile researching the Sinai episode was that Moses had horns.Yes, you heard right. In the earliest known texts of Exodus, Moses wasdescribed as maswa karan in Hebrew and Facies cornuta in Latin. Thisrather shocking phrase was quietly dropped from later editions of the Biblefor reasons you can probably guess. 866 It wouldn’t do very well for Moses tobe of Dæmonic descent! And yet, if you examine Michelangelo’s famoussculpture of the prophet, you will see his brow accented into two distincthorns.Moses’ name, by the way, is Egyptian - not Hebrew. It translates to“The Son”, being a linguistic suffix usually attached to an existing name(Thutmose = Son of Thoth). The use of the suffix alone is highly unusual. Itmight have meant that his father was unknown, or it could have had quiteanother connotation.867 Back to the Book of Enoch …In the first chapter it is recounted that a band of Dæmons led by Satandescended to Earth to intermarry with human females, communicate thebasic sciences and arts to our race, and sire a race of “giants”. This legendhas a precise parallel in the mythology of almost every prominentcivilization of the ancient world. [It is also the central theme of Lovecraft’swork. He patterned Cthulhu, for example, after the Babylonian godOannez-Ea and the Mayan frog-god Vukub-cakix.] As far as the “giants” areconcerned, you will recall from Cloven Hoof #IV-5 that the appearance ofCro-Magnon man (who possessed an average cranial capacity even greaterthan ours) was a sudden and so far unexplained genetic development. Tothe squat Neanderthals he might well have seemed gigantic. All of whichbrings us around to Atlantis.866 In The Powers of Evil (New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1975) Richard Cavendishasserts that the notion that Moses had horns came from a pre-Michelangelomistranslation of Exodus. Cf. P. Merivale, Pan the Goat-God, Harvard UniversityPress,1969, pages #12-13 & #41-2.867 Cf. Michael A. Aquino, Secret of the Lost Ark.- 1123 -Poor old Atlantis! If there’s anything that’s received even a worsebeating from occultist quacks than the Pyramids, this is it. There has beenso much trash circulated about the subject that the onlooker has tended tothrow up his hands in despair, write the whole thing off, and close his mindto it. On the whole we can’t blame him. One writer has commented wrylythat, were an entire sunken city to be discovered on the floor of the Atlantic,scientists would quickly classify it as wreckage from a destroyed Greekcargo ship!What do we know about Atlantis? Plato first brought it to everyone’sattention by describing its history, government, and geography in hisTimæus. The account fell into disrepute due to Aristotle, who denouncedAtlantis as a prankish invention by his teacher. Aristotle maintained thatPlato created Atlantis to illustrate a new political system, convenientlyforgetting that (a) Plato was quite capable of writing about political sciencein the abstract [consider The Republic], and (b) there are a great manypainstaking details in the Atlantis accounts irrelevant to politics.After one clears away the debris, there also happens to be a good deal ofevidence that Atlantis actually existed. There are a good many books whichrecite the entire list of evidence, so we’ll content ourselves with only a fewpoints.In one form or another the deluge legend appears in every majorwestern civilization, usually incorporating the name of Atlantis in somevariant or another. The Druids called their ancestral home Avalon, theAztecs Aztlan, the Egyptians Aalu or Amenti, the Greeks Antilla or Atlantis,the Germanic tribes Valhalla, and the Babylonians Arallu. All of them fixedits location in the central Atlantic Ocean. There is evidence that it may haveestablished the Minoan civilization on Crete as one of its laterMediterranean bases. There is almost a one-for-one similarity between thephonetic alphabet of the Phœnicians and that of the Aztecs. The AzoresPlateau in the Atlantic mountain range shows geologic evidence of beingabove water-level in ancient times. It is covered largely by volcanic rock,which has so far resisted all but the most limited attempts at underwaterexcavation. There are countless other facts we could cite, but you get theidea.This past year Time brought out an article on Atlantis. A group ofscientists decided that a small islet in the Ægean was the fabled kingdom.Their evidence consisted of three or four rough terrain similarities (whichcould just as easily apply to a score of other Mediterranean islands) andevidence of volcanic activity (ditto). On this basis they solemnly announced- 1124 -that the islet met Plato’s description of Atlantis, completely omitting thedetail that he quite pointedly located the island outside the Pillars ofHercules (Gibraltar). The point here is that Plato was smart enough toknow the difference between the Atlantic Ocean and the MediterraneanSea. The scientists, apparently, are not.One way in which Atlantis fell into disrepute stems from the fact that,somewhere along the way, a group of zanies decided that a pre-delugeAtlantic nation had to be complemented by a pre-deluge Pacific empire.And so Churchward and his contemporaries created Lemuria (or Mu forshort). Unlike Atlantis there is neither geologic nor archæological evidencethat anything on the scale of a Pacific continent ever existed. There were anumber of prehistoric Pacific island civilizations, as is evidenced byPonape, Easter Island, etc. - but nothing on the scale of a highly-culturedempire.A careful examination of those Mu books on the paperback racks willexplain why they have been totally ignored by serious scholars. The latestbook in the series is the most fantastic of the lot. It contains a profile oflifein Mu, supposedly taken from bits and pieces of old inscriptions in Central/South America. Suddenly there is quite a bit of Wicca going on in Mu. Nottoo surprising when one sees the pseudonym of Raymond Buckland as an“expert consultant”.Let’s sum up our theory, and you can take it from there if you’re soinclined. We consider it a distinct possibility that a major island civilizationexisted in the Atlantic, and that the sudden intellectual leap of Cro-Magnonman about 40-75,000 years ago was brought about deliberately by“Dæmons” (the ancient Greek term for “teachers”) of non-terrestrial origin.These are the “Sons of God” ( Ben Elohim) of the Book of Enoch and the“Dead Half-Gods” ( Nekyes Hemitheoi) who, according to the TurinPapyrus, ruled Egypt prior to the Menes/Narmer unification. It is they whoestablished the philosophical principles that were to become formalized inthe Order of the Trapezoid and the Church of Satan, and with the passage oftime the more prominent among them came to be called gods by thepolytheists and devils by the monotheists. Of their physical nature wechoose not to speak at this time.- 1125 -Appendix 79: “The Frankenstein Legacy”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #V-2, March-April VIII/1973Shortly after the release of “The Secrets of Life and Death” in our lastissue, a message arrived from the High Priest suggesting we take a look at abook entitled Wilhelm Reich and Orgonomy by Ola Raknes (Baltimore:Pelican, 1971). Muttering something about Japanese paper-folding, wepicked up a copy of the paperback in question. Now Wilhelm Reich issomeone about whom you either know or do not know. Those under 30tend not to know about him, which is not - as you will see - all thatsurprising.Reich was born in 1897 CE in the German-Ukrainian part of Austria.Until 1915 he lived on his father’s farm, although he graduated from aGerman secondary school. After serving as a lieutenant in the AustrianArmy in World War I, Reich entered the University of Vienna, receiving aDoctor of Medicine degree in 1922. He then became the Clinical Assistantof Sigmund Freud’s Psychoanalytic Clinic in Vienna, rising to the post ofVice-Director in 1928. During the same period he served on the faculty ofthe Psychoanalytic Institute in Vienna. It was with the coming of the greatdepression in Germany, however, that Reich’s life was to take a peculiarturn which was to lead him along certain strange and previouslyunexplored paths of physiological research.Communism in the late twenties did not carry the automatic stigmathat Stalin’s brutality was later to bring to it. In the midst of thedepression,Reich sought membership in the party, maintaining that it was preferableto the tyranny of fascism. He told the communists that man must havesexual as well as economic freedom, and they promptly threw him out ofthe party [an incident which was not lost on George Orwell!].As one might expect, the Nazis took an immediate dislike to Reich oncethey came to power. In 1933 he narrowly escaped imprisonment, fleeingfirst to Denmark and then to Sweden. Then, upon the invitation of theDirector of the University of Oslo’s Institute of Psychology, he went toNorway, where he was to reside until 1939. Subsequently he received aninvitation to lecture at the New School for Social Research in New York, andhe remained there as an Associate Professor. In 1950 he moved to apersonal research center in Maine, living there until shortly before hisdeath in 1957.- 1126 -The problem was that Wilhelm Reich discovered - or at least thought hediscovered - the secret of organic life. This interesting developmentoccurred as a consequence of his early research into the significance of thehuman sexual orgasm cycle.At the University of Oslo Reich formulated his original orgasmformula: mechanical tension = bioelectric charge = bioelectric discharge =relaxation. As may be seen from this formula, Reich first supposed sexualenergy to be a form of electricity.Reich then decided to see what might happen if he were to stimulatethis same four-part process in unliving matter. In various experiments hewould sterilize dry grass or coal dust, heat them, and put them into sterile,nutritive solutions. Some of the particles were seen to swell into vesiclesthat moved of their own accord. Reich’s critics considered these only thewell-known Brownian molecular movements, but his supporters claimedthey appeared totally dissimilar under the microscope.At any rate Reich himself was convinced that he had unlocked the keyto life. He published the results of his first experiments in Die Bione, a bookfirst released in 1938. In it he described the new vesicles as bione andargued that they demonstrated the phenomenon of biogenesis.In 1939 Reich made a further discovery. While continuing his bionicresearch, he professed to find a new kind of energy radiating from the bions- one which did not obey the laws for the known forms of energy. Itsconcentration was seen to increase in the more active life-forms (such asman), and the conjunction of two systems bearing this energy would resultin the weaker charge being transferred to the heavier charge - not theexpected equalization process. Reich called this new energy orgone.At about this point Reich began to get into trouble. As a psychologist hehad achieved an international reputation, but these new experiments weredistinctly alarming. The fact that they stemmed from sexual techniquesdidn’t help matters any.In spite of growing public skepticism and then antagonism, Reichcontinued his orgone investigations. From 1940 to 1943 he attempted toascertain whether external orgone radiation would inhibit the usual orgonemetabolism causing - according to his theory - cancer. He found that whenthe degenerative process had not gone too far, it might be halted or evenreversed. And in 1945 he announced what he called primary biogenesis -the creation of life without the use of any preexisting organic material. Hedid this by taking bionous earth, mixing it with water, and sterilizing thecompound. It was then filtered, frozen into ice, and finally thawed. The- 1127 -water now contained substances resembling tiny yellow snowflakes, whichwould develop first into live cells and then into various types of protozoa.Reich’s orgone experiments became more and more startling. Hedeveloped an “orgone accumulator” - a specially designed, insulated cabinetthat would trap orgone and transfer it to the body of a person seated withinthe cabinet. He produced a device known as a “cloudbuster”, which heclaimed would encourage or discourage the formation of rain clouds. Hisformula of cosmic superimposition professed to explain the creation ofstars and galaxies through the meeting of two or more orgone streams.Had Wilhelm Reich been classified as an outright quack, it is probablethat no more attention would have been paid to him than to a snake-oilpeddler. The disturbing thing, however, was that he was an internationallyrenowned scientist. His experiments were carried out in a careful,methodical manner, and he could talk on equal terms with Freud andEinstein, both of whom proved unable to fault his orgone theories. ManyPh.D. holders [including Raknes] first came to Reich expecting to exposeinaccuracies in his formulæ. One after the other they came to admit thatthere was scientific validity in the methods that he used.Popular criticism of this new “Dr. Frankenstein” began to increase. Notthe least of the enmity came from religious institutions, who charged thathe was violating divine laws in his “shocking” pursuits. Finally thecontroversy became too much for even the United States. The Food andDrug Administration sought and won a court injunction forbidding Reichfrom selling or transporting his orgone cabinets across state lines. Reich,having a naïve confidence in the course of American justice, ignored theinjunction. He was arrested, his equipment confiscated, and his unsoldbooks burned in their New York City storehouses. Sentenced to the FederalPenitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, he died in 1957 after serving onlya few months.The injunction, of course, continued in force. The name and writings ofReich were effectively suppressed for more than a decade. Only with thegeneral relaxation of censorship in the first few years of the Satanic Agehave his books begun to be reissued. Certain conclusions of Reich and hiscoworkers may seem glaringly erroneous in the light of present-day medicalknowledge. But other aspects of life as contained in our DNA research beara sobering correlation to Reich’s theories and arguments.It is not our purpose to either condone or condemn Wilhelm Reich.Nevertheless we feel most strongly that he should be given a full hearing,even if it must be post-mortem. You are urged to consider both sides of the- 1128 -coin, examining serious criticism of Reich’s conclusions as well as his ownarguments on their behalf.While we understand that Reich’s original research center ceased tofunction following his death, current information on orgonomy may besecured by writing to: Orgonomic Publications, Post Office Box 476,Ansonia Station, New York, New York 10023.- 1129 -Appendix 80: Letter to an Army ChaplainMarch 30, VIIIChaplain (Captain) Cecil D. LewisUnited States Army Chaplain School #C-22Fort Hamilton, New York 11252Dear Chaplain Lewis:Thank you for your recent letters and the copy of your research paperon the Church of Satan. I am returning the manuscript to you underseparate cover. On the whole I consider it to be one of the most thorough,objective, and perceptive analyses of Satanism yet advanced by aprofessional of another religious persuasion. Such comments as I have arenoted on the margins. The only passage to which I take serious objection inits present form is that wherein you say that Dr. LaVey’s “logic is interestingif not sound!” It is your right to make such an evaluation, of course, but insuch case it is only fair for you to state just why the logic is unsound.Otherwise it is propaganda, not criticism. And while propaganda may beacceptable on the pulpit, I question its place in a research paper.Other than the aforementioned passage, we have no objection to thepaper - complete with the Satanic Bible and Satanic Rituals quotations -being published in its present form. My other comments are intended foryour own information. There are two points, however, to which you mightcare to give particular consideration. First, Anton Szandor LaVey holds theDoctorate of Satanic Theology conferred by the Council of Nine, Order ofthe Trapezoid. If you would refer to him as “Dr.” rather than “Mr.” LaVey,we would appreciate it.Secondly there are two items which, while reported directly, arefactually misleading. The first is that wherein Dr. Starkes includes all thosesilly oaths in our membership requirements. There is no oath connectedwith membership in the Church of Satan. There is an oath contained in theSatanic baptism ceremony (which you may read for yourself), butcompletion of this rite is neither required nor even expected of ourmembers. I haven’t the slightest idea where Dr. Starkes might have receivedhis information. Home Missions magazine did an article on us about a yearago, so as a Southern Baptist he should have known better.- 1130 -The second item which is somewhat erroneous is the Time quotationconcerning our degree system. I myself explained that system to Time’sReligion Editor, and I am at a loss to say how he made such a mess out of it.Our members do not “jockey for upward mobility” via our degrees, nor areour Priests and Priestesses selected as carelessly as the passage implies.There are five degrees of membership in the Church of Satan: Satanist I°,Warlock or Witch II°, Priest or Priestess of Mendes III°, Magister orMagistra IV°, and Magus V°. The first two degrees encompass our laymembership. The last three delineate the hierarchy of the Church - theOrder of the Trapezoid. Admission to the Order involves considerations asserious as those pertaining to clerical orders in other religious disciplines.The style of life of candidates for the Priesthood is among suchconsiderations, but it is by no means accorded inappropriate weight.Before closing I should like to comment upon our official position withregard to the military. I imagine that this should be of particular interest tothe Chaplain School. During my own active duty with the Army, I held botha Regular commission in a combat branch and the III° in the Church ofSatan. During that time I was asked by the Church to ascertain whether itshould seek representation in the Corps of Chaplains. After reviewing thepertinent regulations, I submitted a negative recommendation. It was basedupon two general conclusions:(1) De facto, the military chaplain’s role must be the moral support ofthe commander’s military decisions as they impact the personalities of thesoldiers in the command. Technically, of course, chaplains are free to speaktheir minds. The realities of warfare, however, demand that a successfulunit be morally unified - that every officer and man be convinced of the“righteousness” of the commander’s decisions. A Satanic chaplain wouldalmost certainly clash with this requirement sooner or later. The individualwill is sacred to us; while we reject anarchy as impractical, we cannotofficially sanction its opposite extreme.(2) Chaplains of many separate faiths coexist in the Corps of Chaplains,sensing no inconsistency in this. The Church of Satan, on the other hand,was founded on the theory that theist religion is a social parasite and aninsult to the human intellect. While we may respect the rights and opinionsof theist officials on an individual basis, we will not dignify their cause byrecognizing it as a philosophical equal to our own.Consequently our guidance to Satanists in the American armed forceshas been something like this:- 1131 -“As a citizen of the United States, you have a social obligation to servein the military if called upon to do so. Insofar as your officialresponsibilities are concerned, your conscience must become that of yourcommander, and ultimately that of the President. Your Satanic interestsand activities must be kept separate and distinct from those of the military.Where the two come in conflict, your responsibility as a soldier must takeimmediate priority - particularly since the safety of others besides yourselfmay be involved. If you cannot reconcile your personal philosophy with themental discipline required of a soldier, then you should resign from theservice as soon as you are legally able to do so.“The Church of Satan will not endorse a request for conscientiousobjector status, inasmuch as we feel that all true philosophers object to war.To honor one person’s arrogance over another’s pragmatism would beinconsistent with the ethics upon which the Church was founded. As fordraft evasion, we believe that a person who rejects the more distastefulresponsibilities of citizenship has no right to its benefits. A social contractmust be mutually binding or it does not exist.”This is not a direct quote from a Church document. Consider it ratheran example of what a Church official might say to a member asking him foradvice. Over the past several years we have found such a position to serveboth our best interests and those of the United States. Certainly it requiresunusual mental discipline on the part of the Satanist who may disagree withexisting military or political policies. Nevertheless we feel that those whoare unable to master their own minds are not qualified to be Satanists tobegin with.Concerning the Judaic/Christian approach, we consider it to be flatlyinconsistent with the commandment of their god: “Thou shalt not kill.” Noamount of rationalization, we feel, can abrogate that simple sentence.Accordingly the very existence of a Corps of Chaplains is a mockery of God.Rege Satanas!Michael A. AquinoMagister Caverni IV°- 1132 -- 1133 -Appendix 81: “Newsroom” Broadcast- by Marilyn BakerTelevision Station KQED, San Francisco, March 1973[Questioner:] Tromping around the hills of Santa Cruz, what did youfind this weekend?[Baker:] I didn’t find it, but other people did: Another stabbed murdervictim was found down in Santa Cruz, this time in a city park. The victimwas a school teacher, Bruce McChesney, and the suspect, James Scott, isalready in custody. His father turned him in after Scott allegedly admittedthat he had murdered the victim. But the police found that there is noconnection at all between the latest in the string of 15 homicides in the past2 weeks in Santa Cruz and the macabre beheading murders that haveterrorized that place.“Newsroom” has been investigating persistent rumors that there’s sometype of cult that is engaged in animal sacrifice down there. We can nowreport to you that these rumors are true. The first sacrificed animals werefound on September 12, 1971. Two cows were beheaded; then their Achilles’tendons were cut. Both were hung in a tree and their heads burned in fire.Last summer a dog was a willing sacrifice, according to a tourist whoattended the occult ceremony. This tourist stated that 50 persons at leastare in the cult, and that it is based on black magic or voodoo - not theSatanic religion.On March 20, just last week, a pair of hogs were killed in a fashion thatdrained all of their blood. This occurred within a quarter mile of themeadow where the cows were hung in the tree over a year and a half ago.Lee Davis, the Undersheriff of Santa Cruz, said today: “We know there havebeen similar animal killings, but we don’t keep a file on any of thesethings.” The pair of cows that were beheaded were hamstrung, as I said,just as one of the young women victims was. All of the animals were bled;so were all of the human victims. All of the animals had black hides,although light-colored animals were nearer and more accessible. All of thewomen victims were brunettes. The Undersheriff, Lee Davis, said today: “Idon’t think there’s any connection.”Both the Sheriff’s Department and the Santa Cruz Police have alsomaintained that the rumors of the Satanic cult were nothing more thanrumors. But if they checked the yellow pages of the Santa Cruz phone book,they would find those rumors are indeed fact: The Church of Satan is listedthere and is still operating and in business.- 1134 -But one professional man who has been in contact with the cult thatbeheads these animals says: “This has nothing at all to do with that Churchof Satan; this is strictly voodoo and black magic.” As I understand it, theChurch of Satan does not believe in sacrifice. Their power is, well, not intolove but into pleasure. Physical pleasure is their big thing. The voodoo cultis based on hate and projecting hate against other people psychologically.In fact one of the things he said is that the cult is engaged in psychologicalwarfare with the town of Santa Cruz. Assuming this theory, terror and fearis an indication they’re waging a war, all right.- 1135 -Appendix 82: “We’re Put Here to Enjoy Life,”This Church Believes- by Don WilsonSan Jose Mercury, March 21, 1973Santa Cruz - The ritual chamber was jet black, lighted only by the blackcandle which the Priestess held in her hand, and by a tall black candle ateach end of the high black altar. A long sword, its blade gleaming in theflickering candlelight, lay naked on the altar. The pentagramic goat’s headlooked down from the wall above the altar, and the four imitation humanskulls glowed faintly on the throne at the side of the room. The Priestess setdown the black candle and lay her hand on the sword. This is the innerchamber of the Church of Satan.After coming through the entry room and the inner reception room atthe Church of Satan, a visitor and the Priestess sat there a long time, talkingabout various philosophies of life and man’s relationship to his God and tohimself. “We believe in being honest with ourselves,” the Priestess, DoloresStowe, said, “and that is why we have rejected the hypocritical, orthodoxfaith which has turned all human pleasures into sins. We believe that manwas put here on this most beautiful of all worlds to enjoy the life that wasgiven to him - and man should be whatever gives him pleasure as long ashis doing so will not harm someone else.”The group has chosen the name Church of Satan because, in essence, ithas chosen to follow the forces represented in traditional Christian theologyby Satan rather than those represented by God. The traditional outlook isthat the Satanic forces are evil; the Church of Satan’s is that they are not.If one man has money and another man wants the money, is it all rightto steal it? “There is no need to steal. We have at our command magicalrites by which we can obtain anything we need or want without resorting totheft.” Is the Priestess a magician? “Of course.” Is she a witch? “Of course.In the Church of Satan the lowest order of membership is that of layman.As a member progresses, he becomes a Warlock if he is a man, or a Witch inthe case of a woman. The next step up is Priest or Priestess - so bydefinition a Priestess is also a Witch.”Do the Satanic rituals also include human sacrifice? “No. The centralpremise of the Church of Satan is a love for life, a zest for living. Nomember of this Church would kill anyone ceremonially.” Mrs. Stowe, wifeof Santa Cruz Church of Satan Priest James Stowe, fingered the metallicpendant which hung from a chain around her neck. “But if you were to do- 1136 -anything to threaten my life,” she said, “I would kill you without hesitation.But that would be self-preservation.”A candle flickered in a niche. Outside the heavily curtained windows ofthe home in downtown Santa Cruz, not far from the county courthouse, therain splashed and dripped from the eaves. The gas furnace hissed softly,and a wave of warm air washed over the room. Up above, in the center ofthe room, glowed a 5-pointed star inside a circle - and the head of a goatfitted inside the star. Twin figures of Pan, the goat-footed ancient god, heldbooks on a low table - books which included Anton LaVey’s Satanic Bibleand a thicker book called The Compleat Witch. Human skulls, or replicas ofthem, sat in various places around the room - high above the bookcasewhich filled one whole wall, under a stand which held a lamp, on a tinyshelf above the window curtained in deep red. A horned, Satanic-lookinghead grinned down from over the doorway, and huge black spiders, orreplicas of them, were on the wall not far away.The Priestess fingered the pendant at her breast. “There are no sins inour Church,” she said, “and therefore no feelings of guilt. With therestraints removed, there is nothing to fight against, no reason for defiance,and therefore less tendency towards overindulgence in anything. Otherchurches teach that it is a sin to enjoy food and drink, or sex, that it is asinto be proud or envious. Since these are characteristics of everyone, theleaders of the other churches wield an unshakable power over the people ofthe churches because of their guilt feelings. “I eat what I like, for instance,but I do not overindulge, not because to do so would be a sin against a ruleof the Church, but because overindulgence isn’t good for me. I enjoy ahealthy sexual relationship with my husband and with him alone - notbecause to do otherwise would be a sin, but because I love him and have noneed to look elsewhere for satisfaction.”The Priestess said that the Church of Satan - with headquarters in SanFrancisco - now has perhaps 20,000 members in the United States, andbranches in many other countries. The membership in the Santa Cruz area,she said, is a secret. The Santa Cruz branch of the Church was formedseveral years ago. Its telephone number is listed in the directory. Only amember of the Church, she said, could learn the secret - just as only amember could attend the rituals which mark the functions of the Church.The membership appears to come from a broad spectrum of types, thoughthis too is a secret.Are the rituals “Satanic” in nature, as depicted in novels and movies?“If you mean do we indulge in wild orgies and whirl around in mad dances,- 1137 -no. That picture has been drawn in the imagination of fiction writers. Wechannel our energies towards achieving the objects of our personal needs.”Mrs. Stowe paused. “If you must look for violence,” she said, “look for it outthere.” - and she waved a hand towards the world outside. “Look for itwhere hypocrisy puts the sweet voice of friendliness in a little old lady whotells my 11-year-old daughter that the good people out there are going to killall of us in here.”The Church of Satan, the Priestess said, stands for life and peace andmutual respect and freedom from guilt. “If we had picked any other name,”she said, “no one would know we exist.”- 1138 -- 1139 -Appendix 83: “Satanic Cult Protests”- by Don WestSan Francisco Examiner & Chronicle, April 1, 1973Santa Cruz - Witchcraft rumor mongers had better beware of giving theDevil a bad name, or they may find all sorts of things going bump in thenight. The Priest of the local Karnak Grotto of the Church of Satanproclaims the power of vengeance amongst his many magical rituals andhas been known to use it.“I am more than a little tired of all this talk of blood rituals and sexorgies,” said Reverend James Stowe, angrily fingering his Baphometmedallion outside a dim ritual chamber. “We do not believe in sacrifices,nor do we use blood in our ceremonies,” said his wife, Priestess DoloresStowe. While she admits shedding her black robes of office for nudeparticipation in magic rituals, she insists her role is only a symbolicallypassive one and does not serve any orgiastic purpose.Satanists have been accused of mutilating animals and people in bloodrites in remote sections of the mountains, but local officials have not foundany evidence to support the rumors. Three years ago a dog that had beencompletely skinned floated down Soquel Creek onto the beach at Capitola,renewing the witchcraft rumors. This grisly event coincided with localfilming of an exploitation movie on witchcraft that mixed pornography andpseudo-Voodoo to stimulate box-office interest. A national magazine [ Time- see Appendix #54] kept the myth alive by taking pictures of a mountainfrolic of a group from San Francisco calling itself the New ReformedOrthodox Order of the Golden Dawn. This group’s ritualistic use of a magiccircle to shut out evil forces makes them suspect as nonbelievers.“All evil and power is within the individual, and this nonsense aboutdrawing a circle to keep evil out is just that - nonsense,” said Stowe. TheStowes’ church is located in a white clapboard house in the downtown areawith one room set aside as the ritual chamber. It has a black and red motifand is completely shut away from all light. A skull-bedecked “seat of power”stands against one wall next to the ritual altar. The “sword of power” restson a black mantel awaiting the next ritual.Satan does not really exist as far as their followers are concerned, theStowes said, explaining that the name is merely a symbol to mark theiropposition to Christian principles. Stowe, a former electrical methodsengineer, summed up their philosophy as: “Do what you will as long as noundeserving person is harmed by your actions. We are in no way affiliated- 1140 -with despicable criminals who pretend to be members in order to carry outtheir foul deeds,” he said, adding darkly that authentic members are strict“establishmentarians dedicated to law and order”.- 1141 -Appendix 84: “The ‘Yellow Peril’: Satanism in China”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #V-3, May-June VIII/1973Cloven Hoof articles are frequently inspired in the most peculiar ways.This one, for example, owes its existence to a television show entitled KungFu. If you render due homage to the roob tube, then you are most likelyfamiliar with this new series - being the tale of a renegade Chinese priest inthe American west during the latter 19th century.The series’ name derives from the fact that the priest (David Carradine,son of veteran horror actor John Carradine) is proficient in a variety oforiental unarmed combat techniques. In spite of his rather mildphilosophical disposition, consequently, he is regularly forced to makecorned beef hash out of the uncouth occidental slobs who seem to haveconstituted approximately 90% of our pioneer population.The surprised expressions of those who incur the priest’s wrath are theshow’s forte. The audience revels in mass smugness - a sense of PrivilegedInformation concerning Hidden Powers. The scenario is that of Supermanor Captain Marvel removed to a plausible setting. Kung Fu is a tonic for theperennial paranoia of the “little man”, a fantasy of magical triumphsurpassing even that of James Bond, who must rely at least occasionallyupon gimmicks. [On the other hand, Bond’s sexual adventures are a triflemore interesting than those of the taciturn Chinese priest!]868Naturally all of this is somewhat beside the real point of this article.What aroused our curiosity was the show’s incorporation of a secretoriental religious fraternity into its plot. The initiated priest Caine(Carradine) has a dragon and a tiger fire-branded on his forearms, and thesight of this insignia evokes somewhat the same reaction in his expatriatecountrymen as our own Sigil of Baphomet produces in modern socialcircles. And so, since comparatively little has been said about the secretsocieties that encompassed the Satanic tradition in China, we thought we’dopen this Hoof with a short essay on same.868 Although David Carradine initially approached the television series as aprofessionalacting opportunity, he became fascinated with its philosophical,martial-artistic, andmagical premises and ultimately embarked on a personal quest to develop thesequalities in himself. An absorbing account of this, together with his brilliantcommentary on oriental esoterica, is contained in his book The Spirit of Shaolin(Boston: Charles E. Tuttle, 1991).- 1142 -China’s history, like that of Egypt, is a study in dynastic periods andinfluences. While tradition places the unification of the “Middle Kingdom”at approximately 3000 BCE, the first documented regime - which was toimpart its name to the new country - was the Ch’in Dynasty. But, before weget hopelessly entangled in dates, the Hoof offers a chart:Time periodGovernmentMajor Secret Society255-206 BCECh’in DynastyNone206 BCE-8 CEHan DynastyNone9-24(Wang Mang)Red Eyebrows25-220Han DynastyYellow Turbans221-580(Rival regimes)White Lotus581-617Sui DynastyWhite Lotus618-906T’ang DynastyWhite Lotus907-960(Rival regimes)White Lotus960-1279Sung DynastyWhite Lotus1280-1367Yuan DynastyWhite Lotus1368-1662Ming DynastyWhite Lotus1663-1908Ch’ing DynastyTriad Society/“Boxers”1912-1948Republic of ChinaTriad Society1949-People’s RepublicTriad SocietyAs you can see, the first secret society arose when a political usurper bythe name of Wang Mang seized the throne. He promptly began toimplement a number of rather radical land and economic reforms whichweren’t all that well received by the populace. Guerrilla retaliation arosefrom staunch Han loyalists, who painted their eyebrows red foridentification in combat.The Red Eyebrows grew steadily in power and covert public support,and Wang Mang was finally ousted. Not content to only restore the HanDynasty to power, however, the Red Eyebrows then turned toindiscriminate highway robbery. It became necessary for the dynasty to putits errant benefactor out of business, and a force of imperial troops wasduly dispatched. Legend has it that they surprised and confounded thebrigands by painting their own eyebrows red prior to the outbreak offighting.The eventual downfall of the Han, like that of so many other cultures,came about through religious controversy. Established religion in ancientChina was based upon philosophical principles which would eventuallybecome formalized as Confucianism. In the later years of the Han, however,Taoism (a somewhat more esoteric religious code instigated by Lao-Tzu ca.- 1143 -the 6th century BCE) and Buddhism began to gain significant popularsupport.In 170 a Taoist revolutionary, Chang Chueh, led the Yellow Turbansecret society in an uprising that succeeded in controlling most of northernChina by 184. During the great T’ang Empire there was a wide upsurge inthe popularity of Buddhism, and many Buddhist organizations of aclandestine nature were formed in the more outlying provinces.The Sung Dynasty was brought to an abrupt end in 1280 by theinvasion of the Mongols under Kublai Khan, who then founded the Yuan(Mongol) Dynasty. This was the signal for the consolidation and rise topower of the famous [or infamous] White Lotus, a one-time Buddhistbrotherhood that was to assume a thoroughly Satanic role in Chinesesociety from its creation in 376 until our own era.The White Lotus, now a full-scale revolutionary movement, succeededin driving the Mongols out of China by 1368. Following this the society setits own leader, Chu Yuan-Chang, on the throne. He took the royal nameHung Wu, and the White Lotus proclaimed the new dynastic line “Ming”after the two Chinese Dæmons Ming Wang. The force of their will wasthought to inspire the new regime, which was to prove the mostmagnificent in the history of China. We could easily dwell for another fewpages [at least] upon the multifold artistic and scientific advances of theMing Empire, but to do so would be beyond the scope of this article.In 1644 domestic Chinese rule once more came to an end with theconquest of China by the Manchus. They instituted the Ch’ing (Manchu)Dynasty, which was to endure until the revolution of 1911. Even though theManchus made a deliberate effort to assimilate Chinese customs andmannerisms, there was widespread resentment of the “foreign” rulers. [Thesituation was not unlike that of Ptolemaic Egypt.]The White Lotus, dormant during the later years of the Ming, onceagain grew in strength. In 1794 it rose against the government, seizingcontrol of increasing amounts of territory. Ultimately it conquered 9provinces, and the Manchus were unable to recapture this territory for 8years to come. The White Lotus struck again in 1814, this time temporarilyoccupying the Forbidden City itself. But the Manchus once more proved toostrong, and the White Lotus armies were finally beaten back.Although the White Lotus had long been the preeminent power behindthe scenes in China, it now began to suffer a decline in influence andappeal. One of the primary reasons for this was to be found in itstraditionally Buddhist orientation. The times called for a more flexible,- 1144 -nonsectarian political organization. So it was not altogether surprising thatthe White Lotus began to lose its most brilliant leadership to a moreMachiavellian competitor, the Triad Society. In time the White Lotus, for allintents and purposes, was completely absorbed into the Triad.It was to the Triad Society that Kung Fu’s priest supposedly belonged.[At least this is what is indicated by the dragon/tiger arm-brands.] Thestory behind the society’s origin is quite fascinating. In 1674 the ManchuEmperor K’ang-Hsi faced an invasion from the neighboring state of Silu.Unable to repulse the enemy alone, he appealed to a prominent monk at theShaolin Monastery, Cheng Kwan-Tat, for aid. Cheng and the 128 othermonks responded en masse, and the invaders were driven off within threemonths. Declining all honors and rewards offered by K’ang, the monksreturned to Shaolin.The Emperor’s ministers, however, viewed Shaolin as a potential threatto the Manchu regime. Yielding finally to their urging, K’ang sent an armyto surround and burn the monastery. Cheng was executed, and of the othermonks only 5 survived the incineration of the monastery itself. Knownhenceforth as the “Five Ancestors”, they fled to Fukien Province and thereproceeded to found the Triad Society as an instrument of vengeance. Itsmotto - still observed by the present-day organization for ritual purposes -was “Overthrow Ch’ing, Restore Ming!”. At the first consecration of theTriad, a bright red glow was seen to fill the eastern sky over Fukien. TheFive Ancestors then parted, each setting up a secret Triad monastery in adifferent part of the Chinese mainland.The first major impact of the Triad occurred in 1850, when it played akey role in the so-called Taiping Rebellion. The Taipings, who succeeded incontrolling about half of China for the next 14 years, set up the TriadMaster Hung Hsiu-Chu’an as Emperor at Nanking. They captured or raidedShanghai, Canton, and other major cities. This time the Manchus requiredBritish assistance to reestablish their authority. The rebellion was crushedafter 10 years of bitter fighting and the loss of over 20,000 lives. [One of thechief Manchu mercenaries was the English General “Chinese” Gordon, laterto lose his own life at Khartoum opposing the Moslem forces of the Mahdi.]Until this time the primary concern of the White Lotus and the Triadhad been the expulsion of the Manchus. Now, however, the increasingexploitation of China by the European powers brought about a shift inpriorities. A Triad-controlled movement calling itself the Fists of RighteousHarmony began to conduct guerrilla operations against foreign merchants"},{"pageContent":"and missionaries. Several hundred Christian missionaries had been- 1145 -massacred by these “Boxers” by the turn of the century, at which time a full-scale war erupted (the “Boxer Rebellion”).The Empress Dowager of the Manchus, personally convinced of theBlack Magical powers behind the insurgents, lent first covert and then overtmilitary assistance to them. But even this combined force was no match forthe massive European and American military expeditions that wereimmediately sent to China. The revolt was crushed, and the “Boxers” fadedfrom history.Not so the Triad. Its directorate survived the “Boxer” episode intact. Afew years later one of its leaders, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, succeeded inoverthrowing the Manchus and establishing the Republic of China in 1911.[It is interesting to note that Sun’s rival successors, Chiang Kai-Shek andMao Tse-Tung, occupied no high-level positions in the Triad. Had eitherdone so, the resolution of China’s political structure following World War IImight have been handled without the extensive bloodshed of theCommunist revolution.]In the present-day People’s Republic the Triad Society is, of course,anathema to the Communists. Its existence is vehemently denied, and thesociety’s contacts with other Satanic organizations around the world mustbe carried on under the strictest possible conditions. And we may not speakfurther of this matter right now.There are announced Triad-style societies in Hong Kong and Macao.These, however, are merely criminal organizations controlling drug traffic,prostitution, etc. They possess no intellectual superstructures and noconsistent political or philosophical principles. Two of the most notoriousof these gangs are the Green Pang and the 14K Association, bothheadquartered in Hong Kong. In partial defense of the Hong Kongsocieties, it must be said that the local government’s ethical standardshaven’t been all that exemplary either!A word or two might be said about the influence of the Triad Society inthe United States. First organized in California in the 1850s, the Americanbranch of the Triad was called the “Five Companies” [after the 5 majorpolitical districts of mainland China]. Americans took to referring to thesociety by the name “Tong” (Chinese for “meeting-hall”). Clashes betweenthe Five Companies, other ethnic/religious groups, and domestic law-enforcement groups have continued periodically from the 1850s - thesociety’s “Tong wars” - to the present.Far from being a parasitic or predatory institution within the Chinesecommunity, the Five Companies more often than not has served to protect- 1146 -the Chinese/American citizen against his ruthless exploitation by occidentalinterests. San Francisco’s “quaint” Chinatown, for example, has beenwoefully abused by the authorities in questions of civil rights, minimumwage legislation, and public health benefits.And so oriental Satanism is very much alive, well, and a force to bereckoned with. The next time you pick up a Sax Rohmer novel, consider theworld through the eyes of Fu Manchu instead of from the vantage-point ofthe colonial British. You’ll find it quite illuminating.- 1147 -Appendix 85: Letter,Anton LaVey to Charles Steenbarger[From Diane LaVey’s May 31, VIII/1973 letter to M.A. Aquino: “I’menclosing a blind copy of Anton’s letter to Chuck Steenbarger, as there are anumber of things in it you should know about. In case you have any doubts, allthe things he said about the changes that will take place in the near future arefor real - not just what he wants Chuck to think. Will discuss the variouspoints a bit more later.”]* * *June 3, VIIIDear Adrian:Received your welcome letter of 27 May. Your questions are well put.Inasmuch as you will be called to task by the others at the Conclave, hereare some answers.The Peter Principle is one of tremendous import to members, and theyshould be made to realize our ofttimes Machiavellian use of it. The PleasurePrinciple/Superman inducements of Satanism are a double-edged sword.There is no better nor quicker way of finding a leak in an inner tube than byoverfilling it and plunging it into a tank of water. The Satanic Bible is butone insidious means to isolate the unfit. Over the past few years I haveworked directly on many such projects - all serving to identify, isolate,and/or encapsulate the troublemaker, the malingerer, the degenerate, theoverly-procreative, the social parasite, and those whose unresolved sexualidentities might cause problems.Regarding the year IX [1974], it will bring a sudden, new reckoningfrom those without, and with this a positive kind of recognition that willalmost completely remove us from the “occult scene”. This will come aboutthrough in-depth probing of the “truth” about Satanism and throughcertain revelations which will elicit healthy respect for us [some might callit healthy fear].Media-induced propaganda slated for IX will reach new heights ofsaturation but in assimilable form [not black - dark grey], thus paving theway for the year of the pendulum swing, X.Many TV and theater productions in which Satan emerges as the heroof the story are scheduled. At least one new comic book super-hero in theguise of Satan will appear and bring down the wrath of those who will want- 1148 -to reinstate the old comics code of the fifties, claiming “corruption of themorals of the youth of our country”. Our artists and writers anticipate thiswith glee, for we all know the ultimate reaction to Wertham’s critique of theE.C. comics of ’51-’53. A huge segment of very young (9-16) people willswell the Movement overnight.New measures will be implemented in the selection of III° (Priesthood)candidates. The Priesthood will return to a pastoral position wherebypersonal charisma as well as doctrinal proficiency will be tested, yetopportunities for attainment of the Priesthood will be greater. As theChurch becomes more aboveground, the Order of the Trapezoid will, ofnecessity, submerge itself more.It has been brought to my attention that somewhere along the lineword got out that the Priesthood automatically carries with it admittanceinto the Order. The only such letters of recognition I have signed over toactual members of the Church have gone to IV° holders. Occasionally one ofthe Order will be placed into the existing Church structure, but at noparticular level of membership - in fact seldom above the II°. Conversely, asin the case of yourself and Magister Aquino, entrance into the Order isattained through the Church. It must be remembered that the Church andthe Order are independent of each other, yet the development and securityof the Church are dependent upon the Order.One point that should be stressed is that the growth of contemporarySatanism, as we have propounded it, is not to be measured in membershipfigures, Grotto attendance, Conclave registrations, etc. By its very nature,Satanism is antithetical to collectivism - especially organizationalcollectivism.For each member of the Church there are 99 nonmembers whoclaim membership! We have boxes full of correspondence tosubstantiate this. The only times we have disavowed this are when queriedabout a sensational crime perpetrated by “Satanists”. Then we make it clearto the interviewer that the person in question is not in fact a member of theChurch of Satan.Enclosed are copies of our new mailers, which encourage “free”Satanism yet make formal membership possible for those not discouragedby any bureaucratic tone lent by the mailer. At this time, and in the year IX,the Movement counts most, with membership of secondary importance. Byministering to the social needs of the few, we neglect the social changewhich could be brought about by the many. This is why we are going to- 1149 -accelerate appointment of III° members in IX and, in essence, turn thesocial needs of the membership over to them.The question will arise: How can we conduct rituals and social activitieswhen no one contacts us? An Agent need not concern himself, for all hemust do is be there if needed. On the other hand a Priest [or aspiringPriest] will be expected to recruit acceptable members as a prerequisite tohis office. In short, an Agent will be just that - a contact, liaison, spokesman- and need not further commit himself on an ecclesiastical level.A Priest or Priestess will hold much the same role that Grotto Leadersnow assume, except that a member of the Priesthood will have had toexhibit an ability to sponsor [not proselytize] 10 individual members intothe Church, in addition to meeting existing Priesthood requirements. Thismay prove to be a fly in the ointment for many who lean towards thePriesthood, as it requires a modicum of ability in applied psychology to get10 persons to sign on the dotted line - not to mention a swallowing ofpossible ulterior financial motives in the act of turning over $250 inmembership fees to the Church. If one is Priesthood material, there shouldbe no objection, nor any great problem in discovering 10 qualifiedmembers.I am pleased to see that our present crop of participating members inmost areas are proving themselves to possess individual initiative and tonot depend upon Central Grotto to evaluate their every move. Altogethertoo often I have been informed of members whose peskiness is rationalizedby: “I only want to do what’s right.” The magical ability of a member isjudged on how many things he does right without asking. Those whorepeatedly seek attention via unnecessary queries do not realize thetransparency of their acts. They remind me of radio’s Baby Snooks, whosolicited her daddy’s attention [and wrath!] by her ill-timed attempts to beenlightened. Fortunately we have either weeded out or muted these types.Now communication to Central Grotto is generally informative, andquestions are of genuine concern.I am amused at the current “witchmobile” antics of the Jesus racket. Bylumping us together with the poor Wiccans, ESP, astrologers, and even theJeane Dixons, they not only strengthen us [for we are always cited as theringleaders] but rip apart what our occultist detractors strive so hard toattain: differentiation of their particular occultic bags from the evilSatanists. As far as I’m concerned, let them make fools of themselves, bringabout further reaction against fundamental Christianity [book burnings,- 1150 -etc.], and at the same time gall our paranoid, white light cousins by linkingthem with us.I had Rex Kincaid get a letter off to Judiy Good. 869 After muchcontemplation I have decided to see what she can do with her physical,clerical, and manipulative attributes. I feel it is time she got a good pep-talkfrom me and a crash-course and priming for a role whose time has comeround. She might have the Denver equivalent of the stuff that has madePriestess Lilith Sinclair so productive in the New York area and placed herface on TV screens and magazine pages. I have seen indications of Lilith’ssteadfast loyalty in the midst of discouraging inertia - all the morediscouraging to a physically glamorous woman who could easily havemoved on to more responsive fields of ego stimulation had she needed it.At any rate, I want to judge Judiy for myself. I know there isn’t a witchin N.Y. who can hold her head up since Lilith Sinclair has been seen andheard from. Glamour will be one of our secret weapons for IX; and pretty,public witches of the Church of Satan will have a legacy that no others willbe able to match, even if they had 20 grandmas who were burned at thestake. The cat is already creeping out of the bag, and every American girlwith a Gothic love of the Dark Side and a romantic disposition will want tobe a Satanic witch - not white, green, or turquoise. ’Nuff said.I definitely want to arrange to get to San Francisco while you are in SanJose, preferably to talk to you prior to the Conclave. I have been dividingmy time between our place north of S.F. and Hollywood, where I amworking on some projects. Central Grotto has become a sort of halfwaystation, where the gate is always open to you. I was sorry not to have beenable to get down to see you last time you were in the Bay Area. I usuallymake it a point to be at the Old Dark House for special projects or specialfriends like yourself. You can excerpt this letter at your discretion for theConclave, paraphrasing it if you feel so inclined.At some point during the Conclave, I plan on receiving those III°members in attendance, for many will have traveled a great distance, andsome have never seen the inside of Central Grotto. I would prefer, however,that Miss Good plan her trip at a different time, as I plan on devotingtuition time to Priestess Sinclair during this period. I should like to affordJudiy as much time later as possible. Time: It is really the great enemy [andchallenge]. I have discovered a way of warping it for myself and one or two869 Judiy Good was a member of Steenbarger’s Plutonian Grotto in Denver. Anton’shighhopes for her came to naught.

Diane and I lookforward to seeing you next month.Rege Satanas!Anton Szandor LaVey- 1152 -- 1153 -Appendix 86: Rite of the Undead- by L. Dale Seago III°(Original version) (to Beauclerk)The Rite of the Undead is a brief psychodrama which may beperformed by as few as three persons or by as many as desired. While theword “Dracula” means “Devil” and was, originally, no more associated withthe character we think of than the word “Satan” was associated with theArchDæmon, the book by Bram Stoker and its subsequent exploitation bythe media have developed a strong association with a concept carrying agreat emotional impact: For almost everyone nowadays, Dracula =vampire. And so it is that the master vampire is invoked in this rite.There are no special stage effects or props which are absolutelyessential to the performance of this ritual other than the crucifix, though ofcourse the usual devices standard to all other Satanic ceremonies are alsorequired here. Each group should exercise its own ingenuity, taking intoaccount the facilities available and employing them as it sees fit.The appearance of the celebrant as Dracula could be made veryeffective by having him rise from a coffin, thus reinforcing the popularvampire image while providing the psychological symbolism of rising fromapparent death and corruption to feral life. But then how many of ushappen to have a spare coffin lying around? In most cases something elsewill have to be contrived.The purpose of this ritual is to encourage the participants to becomeaware of and give play to the feral, predatory aspect of their personalities.Through being “bitten” by the vampire they become as he is and canidentify themselves with the concept. The realization and expression of thispart of one’s nature can, when properly employed, prove useful in thecompetitive world outside the ritual chamber.The ritual is opened in the usual manner. The Priest then faces thecongregation and declares:Priest:“My brothers and sisters, we are gathered this night tosummon one to teach us wisdom and show us the wayto the gates of life. From the realm of shadows we callDracula, mightiest of the undead, Voivode of the legionsof those who defy the power of death.” [He turns andfaces the altar, pronounces the Eleventh Enochian Key,and then calls:]- 1154 -“Dracula! Dracula! Through the veils of night we call toyou. Hear us, and come to us swiftly upon the leatherywings of the bat. As your brothers of the Infernal Realmwe call you, and we bid you in the name of Satan tocome among us in friendship to impart to us theknowledge of your ways. Appear to us, O death-defiantprince, and show us how to overcome our great enemy.Dracula! Pravilnoye vos krye sye’ niye!”Participants:“Dracula! Pravilnoye vos krye sye’ niye!” (“Dracula!Truly the Resurrection!”)Dracula:“I have come. What would you of me?”Priest:“Hail, Voivode Dracula. We would learn how to conquerdeath.”Dracula:“You must first face death to negate its power; then youmust embrace life. But the way is too hard for most.Have you the courage?”All:“We have the courage. What must we do?”Dracula:“You must become as I am. The way is painful, but thosewho face the ordeal and survive the transformation shalltruly taste of life. For the bite of the vampire bringsdeath only to those who wear the cloak of falserighteousness; but those who are unafraid to tread mypath, with all its delights and horrors, shall savor suchjoys as only Satan can provide. Do you wish this foryourselves?”All:“We wish it. Do what must be done.”[Dracula places his left hand upon the Priest’s right shoulder, looks into hiseyes as though searching for signs of fear or apprehension, then places histeeth against the other’s neck as though biting him. He then says:]“Dominus Infernus vobiscum.” [to which the Priest replies:] “Et cum- 1155 -tuo.” [The Priest repeats the same action with his assistant, who then doesthe same with a member of the congregation, etc.]Dracula:“It is done. We are the undead, the truly living ones. Ourbodies walk this Earth and seem as those of other menand women, but our souls hold revel in the halls of Hell,where every delight is ours. The power of Satan is oursto wield, for we are his chosen ones. At our commandhis minions shall soar forth upon the storm-winds, andthe children of the night run howling hungrily beneaththe Moon to do our bidding. That which we desire weshall take by our cunning and our force of will. Theweak and stupid of the Earth shall be our tools and ourunwitting slaves, and we shall take our sport amongthem as we please. And they shall know us not, neithershall they have the power to impede us; for they in theirblindness will not believe that we exist.”Priest’s assistant: “But what if someone should believe? What then? Whatof the hated cross and stake of wood?”[Dracula takes from within his garments a crucifix and holds it aloft for allto see.]Dracula:“Behold! I hold this without harm and so shall you, forthe day of the cross and the trinity has come to an end.Dusk has fallen for the God-adorers, and in its shadowswe stalk and prey and take our pleasure. Nor does theSun hold any terrors for us, for its light is the very lightof Lucifer in which we walk proudly and unafraid - thesecret lords of this world.”[Dracula hands the crucifix to the Priest, who holds it for a moment andthen hands it to his assistant, who does the same and then flings itcontemptuously aside.]Dracula:“Of wooden stakes we need have no fear, for by will weshall remain bound for as long as we wish to this world,which Satan has given unto us, his children. You need- 1156 -not fear death, for we who follow the Left-Hand Pathare so filled with life that in us death can find no placeto enter.” [He raises his hands in the Sign of the Horns.]“ T h i s E a r t h i s o u r s , t o h a v e a n d t o h o l d !Shemhamforash! Hail, Satan!”All:“Shemhamforash! Hail, Satan!”[The figure of Dracula no longer appears, and the ceremony is concludedaccording to the customary procedures.]- 1157 -Appendix 87: “Satanists Seek ‘Elite’ Only”- by John MakeigFort Worth Star-Telegram, October 3, 1973The house in East Fort Worth is plain-looking and not mysterious - onestory in height, wood frame, with a spacious lawn spotted by tiny pines andshaded by tall elm trees. Dogs bark at paperboys on bicycles in the streetout front, and next door a man with an edger grinds it savagely into hisfront walk by mistake. As sparks from the edger’s blades died in theafternoon air, passing cars rustle leaves in the gutter. Few would suspectthat Satan’s advocates are in the area.“Come on in,” said the 27-year-old man870 who came to the door.Holding the screen open, he put out his hand to be shaken. “I’m theRegional Agent,” he said. Since last May he has been Regional Agent of thenational Church of Satan’s group in Fort Worth. Spokesman for - but notleader of - an unrevealed number of 21- to 35-year-old local Satanists, theRegional Agent stepped back after issuing greetings to enter the house.The Agent has light brown, curly hair that hangs to the collar of hisshort-sleeved sports shirt. Behind wire-framed glasses his eyes are brightand serious. The heels of his boots clomped across the wooden floor,stepped over a rolled-up carpet wrapped in brown paper, and then movedinto the front room where he sat on an L-shaped couch.Moments later a pretty 23-year-old woman871 - tall, slim, and well-tanned - entered soundlessly on bare feet and sat in a chair with the frontwindow to her back. “This is DeAnn,” the Agent said for an introduction.DeAnn swept aside her dark hair and smiled broadly. Dressed in apatterned halter and cutoff jeans, she was about 75% bare. It seemedpossible that Fort Worth’s Satanists had selected their most attractivegroup member to be placed on public display. But it developed that she alsoknows her stuff on Satanism.A Star-Telegram reporter gained an interview with local Satanists aftera letter was sent to San Francisco, where in 1966 Anton Szandor LaVeyfounded the Church of Satan. LaVey forwarded the letter to a Houstonman872 who, as a Priest of Mendes, is Texas’ senior Satanist - as far as the870 Paul Pipkin I°.871 Diane Pipkin I°.872 L. Dale Seago III°.- 1158 -Church of Satan is concerned anyway. He gave the Regional Agent the go-ahead. In the initial letter to Dr. LaVey, it was stipulated that his FortWorth followers’ names would not be used. The 1-1/2 hour interview tookplace on the afternoon of Labor Day. A few hours after the interview wasover, the first half of Dr. LaVey’s 1969 book the Satanic Bible was read, andthe lengthy conversation that afternoon began to seem a novel andarticulate recitation of the sayings of Anton LaVey.The Regional Agent began by explaining that Regional Agents - theyexist in Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and El Paso as well as here -are mostly mail sorters. He said both he and DeAnn are among theChurch’s lowest echelon, the Church’s general membership, which iscomposed of neophytes who have yet to advance to Witch or Warlockstatus. He said he answers and writes letters, passes down word of high-level Satanic doings to local members, and talks to nonmembers - mostlythose who have written letters of interest to San Francisco.DeAnn and the Regional Agent both said they became interested inSatanism a couple of years ago after reading LaVey’s books. They joined theChurch after interviews with another Regional Agent. The Regional Agentand DeAnn made it clear that one of their primary motives in granting theStar-Telegram the Labor Day interview was to interest like-mindedindividuals in Satanism - just Anton LaVey-style Satanism, they said, not“teeny bopper” Satanism, not “white witch” Satanism, nor that of any otherof the splinter groups that constitute Satanism in America. The motherChurch in San Francisco is their sole concern; they purport to represent noothers.The Fort Worth group came together in 1971. The Regional Agent saidthe Church’s doings are yet “formative” in Texas. He said that there likelyhave been Satanists of some ilk in Fort Worth for years, and said some ofthem moved to the Church of Satan when it came here two years ago.The Regional Agent’s first unexpected statement - and many were tofollow - entailed the extreme elitism of his Church. “The Christian church isnot the main obstacle Satanism has to overcome in becoming the elite sortof society we want,” he said. “We’re trying to secure a privileged position inevery walk of life. We’re not interested in converting most Christians,because they’re too puny. As individuals they’re too weak-willed.” Eyesclosed behind wire-rimmed glasses perched midway up her nose, DeAnnsnorted. “Christianity’s a crutch,” she interjected.“We promote elitism,” he continued. “Obviously the ideas we promoteare applicable only to a few. The members of our Church are educated,- 1159 -intelligent, and individualistic. Obviously there are those who can’t believe.We don’t represent the poor.” [“Blessed are the strong, for they shallpossess the Earth,” states Dr. LaVey’s paperback Satanic Bible on page #34.“Cursed are the weak, for they shall inherit the yoke!”]“Dr. LaVey’s pointed out a number of times what’s the hallmark of agood Satanist,” the Regional Agent said. “They’re the people who can getwhat they want. It’s simple. They’re people who can attain what’s importantto them.” He said “get what they want” has to do with the amassing ofwealth, having power, having sexual gratification and enough to eat, andother such goals of a not uncommon nature. [“Blessed are the powerful, forthey shall be reverenced,” the Satanic Bible states on page #34. “Cursed arethe feeble, for they shall be blotted out!”]“We’ve been called the Unitarians of the occult,” said the RegionalAgent. “Satan for us is a convenient symbol of what we call the carnalnature of man. Man is an animal with definite material needs that outweighany need that might be called spiritual.” [“Life is the great indulgence -death the great abstinence,” states the Satanic Bible on page #33.“Therefore make the most of life - here and now!”] “I think people wantto feel lusted after,” observed DeAnn, who also said sex acts are notincluded in Satanic rituals. “I think it’s a very healthy thing.” Seven feetaway from her the Regional Agent snickered and said, “That’s the way itshould be. It’s not bad.” Then he changed the subject.With some awe, he became reflective just long enough to castChristianity the sole compliment it was to receive during the interview.“Christianity’s been a strong force for a long time. For a lot of centuries,” hesaid. “It’s controlled people’s sex lives to a great extent. Just to be able todictate the rules of things like mating is a considerable power.” [“Is not ‘lustand carnal desire’ a more truthful term to describe ‘love’ when applied tothe continuance of the race?” states the Satanic Bible on page #33. “Is notthe ‘love’ of the fawning scriptures simply a euphemism for sexual activity,or was the ‘great teacher’ a glorifier of eunuchs?”]The Agent was then asked to define “Satan”. Considerable discussionfollowed the question. The Regional Agent indicated that Satanists locallyhave no great faith in the existence of either God or Satan, Heaven or Hell,the human soul, or anything more than what they can make of themselvesthrough effort and belief in the Satanic religion. He said “Satan” - as peoplehave come to view him over the years as a result of Christianity’s teachings -is nothing folks need fear, or at least not the Satan revered by the Church ofSatan.- 1160 -Both the Regional Agent and DeAnn said repeatedly that society’sconcern about Satan is a product of the “paranoia” that Christianity, theysaid, has inflicted on considerable millions of Christians over the centuries.“I don’t believe there’s a personal Devil,” the Agent said. “I think he’s aconstruct of the personal paranoia of a lot of people.”Across a table topped with Satanic pamphlets, handouts, books, andthe cover of a 1971 Look magazine with Anton LaVey’s face thereon, DeAnnbecame animated. “It’s the ‘loser’ mentality,” she said, waving her arms.“People say, ‘Oh, it’s the Devil.’” [“The semantic meaning of ‘Satan’ is the‘adversary’ or ‘opposition’ or the ‘accuser’,” the Satanic Bible states on page#55. “The very word ‘devil’ comes from the Indian ‘devi’, which means‘god’. Satan represents opposition to all religions which serve to frustrateand condemn man for his natural instincts. He has been given an evil rolesimply because he represents the carnal, earthly, and mundane aspects oflife.”]The Regional Agent was asked if he believed Satan could bring downthunderbolts and smite Christians who threatened him. “Who’s up there tobring down anything?” he said with a grin. [“Satan, the chief devil of theWestern world, was originally an angel whose duty it was to reportdelinquencies to God,” the Satanic Bible further states on page #55. “It wasnot until the 14th century that he began to be depicted as an evil deity whowas part man and part animal, with goat-like ears and hooves. BeforeChristianity gave him the names ‘Satan’, ‘Lucifer’, etc., the carnal side ofman’s nature was governed by the god who was then called Dionysus orPan, depicted as a satyr or faun by the Greeks. Pan was originally the ‘goodguy’ and symbolized fertility and fecundity.”]The Regional Agent’s statements regarding humanity’s lack ofindividual souls again was brought up. He was asked what he and DeAnnthought of life after death. He gave this question even more carefulattention than its predecessors. He started to answer, then stopped andsaid, “Cancel out the start,” and finally arrived at this: “Many local Satanistsdo not believe in personal life after death. As for myself, I’ve studied a greatdeal of psychic phenomena. I think there may be another dimension tohuman existence that we haven’t found yet.” DeAnn said she agreed withthe Agent that Heaven and Hell are purely Christian concepts, but addedthat her own feeling was that, come the moment of a person’s death,“there’s some release of energy” back into whence it came. [“There is noHeaven of glory bright, and no Hell where sinners roast,” states the SatanicBible on page #33. “Here and now is our day of torment! Here and now is- 1161 -our day of joy! Here and now is our opportunity! Choose ye this day, thishour, for no redeemer liveth!”]The Agent was then asked if members of his group had burned downSt. John’s Episcopal Church on March 24, or if his people had burglarizedtwo other Fort Worth churches to steal their religious objects. Previouslyamiable, the Regional Agent grew momentarily hostile. His indignantdenial was obvious. He said Satanists have no use for Christian religiousarticles. “There are a lot of dangerous nuts loose in society. There alwayshave been,” he said somewhat emphatically. “We fully support the police inhunting them down.” He said Satanists have been successful in helpingpolice in other cities catch persons whose crimes previously had beenattributed to Satanists such as those belonging to the Church of Satan.He cited Anton LaVey’s background. He said that in addition to havingbeen a lion tamer in a circus and a professional organist, LaVey also spentsome time with the San Francisco Police Department as a policephotographer. He said LaVey’s objections to criminality have been recordedin many places.The Agent referred to the crimes of Charles Manson and his followersin California. He said Manson had only one time used the name of Satanafter his arrest, and since has been characterized widely as a bona fideSatanist. The Agent said that Manson spent considerably more time talkingabout God than the Devil.He then referred to a mass murder in North Carolina last year in whichsome high school students who professed to be Satanists had slaughteredseveral of their classmates. This too, the Regional Agent said, was the workof “lunatics” and not that of the Church of Satan. He reiterated that LaVeyand the Church stand unalterably opposed to such acts, and said Satanistshere support their local police.“When I was a kid in high school,” DeAnn added, “there was a kid whodid things like stealing from churches. But everybody knew he was just anut. No one claimed he was a Satanist. People are just so paranoid now thatthey blame us for a lot of stuff we don’t know anything at all about.” Shewent on to say that the Church of Satan does not sacrifice animals norconduct orgies. “If people want that,” she said, “they’d better go elsewhere.”- 1162 -- 1163 -Appendix 88: “Satanism”- by Joyce BauchnerCourier-News, September 8, 1973SPOTSWOOD - SATANISM - In the midst of a black, barren field, redflames illuminating their hot bodies, nude, chanting figures kneel aroundthe dark-robed priest as he sacrifices the youth to the diabolical god of theunderworld. That’s the picture many laymen conjure as their view ofSatanism, largely through the written word, music for opera and ballet, andmodern-day films.In reality the actual participants - a dark-haired mother of two - maybethe woman next door, sending her children out to play on a sunlit morning,or a 27-year-old Ohio disc jockey walking down a Columbus street late inthe afternoon on his way to work. Both Lilith Sinclair, Priestess of themetropolitan area Grotto (congregation) of the Church of Satan and JohnDeHaven, High Priest and head of the Church of Satanic Brotherhood,describe Satanism as a “religion of life”.Modern Satanism comes as close to the bloodthirsty orgy of nudeDevil-worshippers pictured by many as modern Christianity does to thebloody torturings of the Inquisition. Since 1966, when on the last night ofApril (Walpurgisnacht, the most important holiday to believers inwitchcraft) Anton LaVey announced the formation of the Church of Satan,the new religion, which claims to bring man back to himself has grown tothe call of 20,000 congregants divided among the various Satanic churches.“We don’t see Satan as a deity. We worship no gods or deity whatever,”said Lilith, sitting in her small apartment here. According to DeHaven,Satanists reject the ideas of Heaven and Hell, or anything after death. “Webelieve that when you die, you die,” he said. “Therefore you should live thefullest life possible while on Earth.”Satanists believe there is a form of energy, a “life force”, which throughcontrol of the mind can be tapped and released in the desired direction.According to Lilith, it is this life force which ancient Satanists sought tocapture as it is released through the violent death of their sacrifices.Modern Satanism, however, does not entail any form of sacrifice. “Afterall, the human body is nothing but thousands of atoms. There is a wholeuniverse of energy; all we do is borrow from the energy that there is,” saidthe Rev. Wayne West, the Magister Magnus (great priest) of the Church ofSatanic Brotherhood. Rev. West, who was a Roman Catholic priest for nineyears, studying at the Vatican archives to become a master theologian for- 1164 -the Catholic Church, said that originally the Trinity was God the father,Jesus Christ, and Satan-Lucifer.Satanists claim that since Christianity perverted Satan to represent theopposite of church doctrine, the symbolic worship of the Devil is anappropriate characterization of their rejection of Christian teachings.Satanism rejects abstinence for indulgence, but not compulsion. Lilithdescribes the guiding tenet of the religion as “Do what thou wilt as long asno undeserving person gets hurt.”By “undeserving”, Satanists mean that if someone hits you, you are notsupposed to turn the other cheek “but slug him back”, explained DeHaven.“We don’t believe any of the seven deadly sins recognized by most Christianchurches are evil. Satanists, like all human beings, are envious, proud, andambitious; only Satanists are not hypocritical about it. Can you imagine thekind of world it would be without ambition?” asked DeHaven.Satanists know no universal sins; the religion does not recognizeuniversal good or evil. “Each one sets up standards and ethics on anindividual basis. You know that child who was recently killed in New Yorkwith the ‘X’ across his chest? To me this evil is the worst form. There is nojustification for killing a child.”Modern Satanism, using psychodrama, the pomp and ceremony, theritual of the religion itself, taps and directs the energy force. “Allceremonialmagic really entails is psyching yourself to a certain point and releasing it.The ceremony, the ritual helps the members accomplish this,” saidDeHaven. “When the priest calls forth the four crown princes of Hell, he’snot really summoning demons. What he is doing is calling on an energyforce - what we are doing is giving names to energy,” he said.“During the ritual you turn your mind inward and blank out the rest;you make the psychic energy flow from within,” said Lilith as she sat in herlong black cape, eyes intently fixed on an arrangement of black paper roses,a gift from someone who had heard her during a lecture. Then, as the musicof Holst’s The Planets thundered throughout the room, Lilith, in her blackceremonial robes, approached the altar and rang the silver bell, thustransforming the living room into a Satanic ritual chamber. The air havingbeen cleared by the symbolic ringing which opens each ritual, the Priestessfaced the altar, gave the Satanic two-horned sign, and began the chant: “Innomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi excelsi. In the name of Satan, the rulerof the Earth, the king of the world, I command the forces of Darkness tobestow their Infernal power upon me!”- 1165 -The rectangular altar, draped in black cloth, has been set up along thewest wall, the traditional location for the Satanic altar. Since Satanism is a“carnal” religion, rejoicing in man’s natural state, his instinct and flesh,whenever possible a nude woman, symbolizing mother Earth who givesbirth to all life, serves as the altar. When this happens, the instrumentsused during the ritual sit on a black-draped table within the reach of theperson conducting the service.Above the altar sits the Sigil of Baphomet, the sign of Satan, whichmost Satanists wear like a Christian wears his cross. The Baphomet, a goat’shead within an inverted pentagram surrounded by Hebrew letters whichspell “Leviathan”, represents the Powers of Darkness and the generativevirility of the goat. Since the upright pentagram - three points up and twopoints down - when encompassing the figure of a man, represents thehuman spiritual nature, Satanism uses the inverted pentagram to signifythe opposite - man’s carnal nature. The horns of the goat thrust upward indefiance of the other three inverted points, which represent the holy trinity.Between the altar and the Baphomet hangs an inverted crucifix. Lilithexplains that this is not to be blasphemous or anti-Christian. But sinceSatanists view the crucifixion as symbolizing guilt, pain, and death-worship, the inversion represents life.At the far right of the altar, or in the corresponding hands of thewoman serving as the altar, sit the black and white ritual candles. Thecandles symbolize the light of Lucifer, the bearer of enlightenment. Thewhite candle on the right represents the hypocrisy of the “white” magiciansand followers of the Right-Hand Path. The black candle on the left is asource of power to participants and is used to burn parchment on whichcurses and blessings have been inscribed. Other black candles supply theonly illumination in the chamber.On the altar sit the bell, chalice, sword, phallus, gong, and parchmentused in ceremonies. Since gold has always been associated with Heavenlyreligions, none of the implements is made of gold.At both the beginning and end of each ceremony, the priest rings thebell, turning counterclockwise and stopping at each point of the compass.According to Satanic teachings this is done at the beginning to purify the airof all external sounds and at the end as a pollutionary signal indicatingfinality.The chalice (goblet) holds the symbolic elixir of life, which is usuallywine. First the priest and then the members drink from the chalice, thusdrinking the fruits of life.- 1166 -The sword represents power and serves as an extension of the arm orfinger with which the priest gestures throughout the ceremony. Lilith usesthe Grotto sword, which carries the signs of Satan, power, infinity,destruction, and protection on the blade, to call forth the four crownprinces of Hell - Satan, lord of the Inferno from the south; Lucifer, lord oflight from the east; Belial, ruler of the Earth from the north; and Leviathan,serpent of the seas from the west.When gesturing, Lilith uses her personal dagger, a gift from her Grottomembers which bears the inscription “Mehr sein als scheinen” (“Be morethan you seem”).873The phallus, which on Sinclair’s altar is a black rod resembling amagician’s wand, is a fertility symbol which represents virility andaggression.The gong is used to call upon the forces of Hell and is rung each timethe Grotto repeats the words “Hail, Satan”.On the parchment is written any curse or blessing which will be burnedin the white or black candle depending upon the request.“Open wide the gates of Hell, and come forth from the Abyss to greetme as your sister and friend …” As she finishes the opening invocation, thePriestess calls forth the demons by name: “Lilith, Abaddon …” Grabbing thesword and facing the south, she summons the four crown princes of Hell.Soon she will begin to chant an Enochian Key, of which there are 19,each serving a different purpose. Enochian is an ancient language whichfirst appeared in print sometime in the 17th century. Enochian chants,called keys, are used for various rituals.Rituals can be of three types: compassion, destruction, or lust. But evenwhen the rituals are not being performed, the Satanic decor of theapartment, like the Madonnas on the shelves of many Catholic homes,speak of the religious nature of the house.Standing in front of the black door, which is trimmed in red with twohorns painted at the top, Lilith points out the sculptured head of Pan sheplans to place between the horns above the doorway. “We don’t allowpeople under 18 to join our Church,” she said as she arranged the statuettesof ancient demons on the shelf. “We feel that they might be fascinated bythe mysticism and not really believe in or understand the theology.”873 This inscription identifies the dagger - a German SS-style model - as one ofthosepresented by the Napolas (“National Political Institutes of Education” - theelite youthacademies of the Third Reich).- 1167 -Lilith is not bringing up her two children as Satanists. Instead sheallows them to experience various religions, explaining Satanic beliefs butallowing them to attend Sunday schools with their friends. “I don’t feel Ihave the right to raise them knowing only my way. When they’re oldenough, they will choose. We even still have a Christmas tree, but it is not areligious thing. I just feel I don’t have the right to deprive them of the joyofSanta Claus,” she continued.Lilith was a Roman Catholic, Methodist, Seventh Day Adventist, andnonbeliever before turning to Satanism. After someone gave her a copy ofLaVey’s Satanic Bible to read, she became a member of the Church. “Withall other religions you always get to a point where you cannot do somethingbecause they say it’s a sin. The problem is that, deep inside, you don’t feelyou are sinning. It becomes a push-pull thing inside you. ThroughSatanism, however, I found the peace of mind, contentment, and freedomfrom guilt that I never found in other religions,” she said.- 1168 -- 1169 -Appendix 89: Letter of III° Nomination- by Michael A. Aquino IV°IX/1974Upon nomination to the Nine you have been approved as a candidatefor elevation to the Priesthood of Mendes. Certain procedures must now befollowed before the Council will make a decision concerning your formalordination. It is the purpose of this communiqué to explain theseprocedures and to set forth pertinent criteria concerning the Priesthood.As you are well aware, admission to I° membership in the Church ofSatan is granted only after careful evaluation of the applicant’squestionnaire. Even so, applicants are given the benefit of the doubt wherepossible, on the assumption that exposure to the teachings of the Church ofSatan may serve to correct personality imbalances or preconceivedmisunderstandings concerning the Black Arts. Accordingly there is acalculated attrition in the I°, inasmuch as some individuals cannot or willnot accept the standards of mental, physical, and metaphysical disciplineexpected of a true Satanist.Standards for the II° are correspondingly more stringent.Approximately five percent of the total Church membership hold thisdegree, which is awarded by the Nine primarily upon the evaluation of awritten examination. The II° constitutes a decision by the Nine that thecandidate possesses a working understanding of the principles of Satanism,and that he or she is endeavoring - within personal capability - to put theseprinciples into practice. Confirmation of the II° is undertaken with suchcare that the attrition rate is practically nonexistent. The II° is regarded bythe Nine as the highest recognition of magical expertise that may bebestowed upon a lay member of the Church of Satan.Ordination to the Priesthood of Mendes involves considerations socomplex that a summary treatment of them is impossible. Without a doubtthe Satanic Priesthood is far more difficult to attain than the priesthood ofany conventional church. Taken into consideration are the candidate’s pastachievements, present activities, future potential, and psychologicalmakeup. From the time of a candidate’s initial nomination to the issuanceof such a communiqué as this one, an exhaustive examination lasting atleast one year is pursued by representatives of the Council. Those who failto stand up under this scrutiny are simply never made aware of theirnominations.- 1170 -Within the scope of the I° and II°, allowances are made for the abilityand skill levels of the individual. If he or she is making the best use of theinnate potential possessed, the criteria for those degrees are satisfied. Inshort, the lay Satanist is measured against himself, not against humansociety as a whole.Just the opposite is true with the Priesthood of Mendes. Here ambitionand noble intentions cannot compensate for lack of ability, socialeffectiveness, and aggressive application of the principles of Satanism whendealing with others. Applicable here is an age-old Satanic aphorism: “Asabove, so below”. Since individuals are naturally reluctant to recognize theirown limitations - and to accept the fact that they cannot transcend them -this criterion has seemed both unfair and abusive. It has embittered many awould-be Priest, and it has even caused the downfall of confirmed Priestswhose judgment was adversely affected by the powers and prerogativesinherent in their office.Before you elect to proceed with your candidacy, you are advised to givethis aspect due consideration. It may be that in spite of your most thoroughefforts, ordination will be denied you - for reasons over which neither younor the Nine have the slightest influence. There are lesser honors which youmay seek that do not encompass this hazard. Indeed, as a recipient of the II°, you already possess evidence of our recognition and approval of yourefforts.There is much that is allegorical concerning lay membership in theChurch of Satan. Our activities, communications, and publications allreinforce this. A person can be an accredited Satanist and yet consider thePrince of Darkness no more than an interesting and illustrative figure ofmyth.With the Satanic Priesthood the allegory ends. As the ordainedrepresentative of Our Lord Satan, you will become a living embodiment ofthe Powers of Darkness. You will retain mastery of your own Will; indeedyou will be strengthened in this regard. Nevertheless you will become anagency through which the Devil will achieve his ends. By now you should besufficiently acquainted with the true motives and ambitions of the Churchof Satan, and this realization will inspire you with exultation, not fear ordoubt. If the latter is the case, you should proceed no further. Bram Stoker,a member of the Satanic Core of the old Golden Dawn, emblazoned thisprinciple in the first words of his celebrated literary figure, Count Dracula:“Welcome to my house. Enter freely and of your own will.”- 1171 -The Satanic Priesthood is not an office that can be assumed ordisregarded at whim. It will remain with you constantly. It will color yourevery decision, expression, and action. So marked will be the effect uponyour personality that you may seem alien even to many of your closestfriends. As you enter new spheres of interest, it may be necessary toabandon old ones. Strange paths await the chosen of Satan, and they maybring misery as well as majesty. You enter a realm characterized bychallenge and choice, not by comfort and consolation.So it is written. As a Priest or Priestess of Mendes, you will learn manythings about the true Prince of Darkness and the forces under his control.Much will become clear to you that has heretofore seemed obscure orincomprehensible. That which inspires you will turn your entire universe toyour advantage, if you but make the effort to recognize the signals whichwill be manifest to you. “All this power will I give thee, and the glory ofthem: For that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.”And finally, an admonition: If you accept the Priesthood in good faithand subsequently decide that you cannot sustain the powers which havebeen bestowed upon you, you will be free to resign your office with honorand impunity. If, however, you deliberately move to abuse the trust andconfidence which have been placed in you, it would be better had you neverbeen born. So also it is written.And now, if you will, proceed:As evidence of the circles in which you make your influence felt, send tous the names of ten members of the Church of Satan whose decision to jointhe Church was prompted by contact with you personally. If in doubt as tothe extent you influenced such a decision, set forth full particulars.Confirm in writing the following personal facts: Full name, mailingaddress, residential address, business & residence telephone numbers,citizenship, height, weight, color of hair & eyes, marital status, names &ages of spouse and children [if applicable], social security number, andsecurity clearance [if any].Are you presently employed?

Unanimous recommendation to theHigh Priest is necessary for a new Priest or Priestess to be admitted to theOrder of Mendes. Ultimately sanction of each new ordination must be madeby the Powers of Darkness themselves, according to symbolisms which areas old as man himself. You may be advised of a decision relatively swiftly, oran indefinite time may elapse before this takes place. There are many forceswhich have a bearing upon the question of ordination.“Therefore, harken unto my voice! I have talked of you, and I move youin power and presence, whose words shall be a song of honor, and thepraise of your god in your creation!”The Council of Nine- 1174 -- 1175 -Appendix 90: “Santa Barbaran’s Home isDevil of a Place for Church”- by Mary EverySanta Barbara News-Press, October 16, 1973The ranch-style home looks among the least likely to be expectingcompany in its block in a suburban neighborhood on the city’s north side.Behind a slightly sloping lawn and two willowy cypresses, it is dark amidstthe lights of neighboring houses and beneath the night’s crescent moon.The buzzer is activated, but there is only silence in response. The doorthen slips slowly open, revealing a looming figure in a black hooded robe,the face a grotesque contortion sprouting fangs and horns. Stubbornlyunresponsive to conversation, the arcane host beckons in slow motion theway to a couch in a spartan sitting room furnished with Victorian antiques.The couch faces a home organ, which is set with two flickering blackcandles, a bell, a chalice, and the holder for an incendiary flame.Illuminated by candlelight above the altared organ is a black invertedpentagram framing a Satanic goat’s head. On the wall to the left hangs aslender sword made of a stag’s horn.After seating his guests, the host stealthily retreats through anotherdoor, all the while in silence adhering to some unspoken command. Froman unseen source in the semidarkness, the room fills with a macabre voicedroning incantations, mournfully accompanied by music from an organ: …“Voices of my vengeance (thunder) … plain of writhing serpents … thisvictim I have chosen … with the sting of scorpions … plunge his substanceinto the dismal void …” The chant swells to a crashing crescendo, the soundof a gong, “Hail, Satan!”Curtains rustle at the right side of the room, and out patters an Irishsetter. The lights in the room are snapped on, and Michael Aquino, wearinga welcoming smile, black turtleneck, sport coat, and silver invertedpentagram pendant, enters the room and introduces the dog, Brandy.Lightly alluding to the previous scene and its recorded message as “a stageddemonstration; there’s a lot of mischief in us”, Aquino explains that hedoesn’t hold any group rituals here - only for himself and visiting officials ofthe Church.A certified celebrant of such diabolic rites, Aquino is a member of theCouncil of Nine, the international directorate of the Church of Satan, inwhich he holds the degree of Magister Templi, a position comparable tothat of archbishop in a “conventional” church, he explains.- 1176 -The controversial church was founded in San Francisco in 1966 byAnton Szandor LaVey, a former lion tamer and current practitioner of theBlack Arts. According to a Time magazine cover story “The OccultRevival” (June 19, 1972), “the Church offers a mirror image of most of thebeliefs and ethics of traditional Christianity”. Its members, states thearticle, “invest themselves with some of the most flamboyant trappings ofoccultism, but magic for them is mostly psychodrama - or plain old carnivalhokum. They invoke Satan not as a supernatural being, but as a symbol ofman’s self-gratifying ego, which is what they really worship.”Aquino, who says observations in the Time article about his Church areessentially valid, points to the inverted pentagram on the wall, noting itssymbolic “inversion of the spiritual and elevation of the carnal”. He leadsthe way into his nocturnal office, where he sits behind an uncluttered,heavy desk. His pallor is accentuated by coal-black hair that trickles intosideburns, and heavy eyebrows with a Gothic upturn.His involvement with the Church, he explains, began approximately inthe Satanic year III. His official correspondence is presently dated VIII. Itwas about the time the movie Rosemary’s Baby was released, he recalls,noting that LaVey, the Church’s High Priest, had provided the technicalexpertise for the film and played the role of the Devil. “I was a Lieutenant inthe Army and in San Francisco for business at the Presidio. Rosemary’sBaby was being premiered in the city, and I caught the early show. Afterthat show, and before the next one began, a black hearse pulled up, lettingout a group of people in black robes. One of them, I was told, was AntonLaVey.“The next time I returned to San Francisco, I read in the paper thatLaVey was going to give a lecture at his Central Grotto in the city. I went tothe lecture, somewhat skeptical and prepared to be entertained. Thatevening it was a lighthearted talk on fortune-telling techniques. The manhimself struck me as sincere, but not evangelical about his cause. He didn’tstrike me as a fanatic.” Aquino relates that later, while stationed inVietnam, he did research towards the Satanic Priesthood, and after hisreturn was ordained in a “stormy ceremony”.A framed red plaque issued to him by the Church hangs on the wallamidst some forty conventional white awards and certificates, including ascroll commemorating his service as National Commander of the EagleScout Honor Society and two commissions from the President of the UnitedStates. A resident of Santa Barbara since 1961, Aquino, an honor graduateof Santa Barbara High School, attended the University of California, Santa- 1177 -Barbara on a scholarship from the government. He was decorated inVietnam for his work in psychological warfare, and attained the rank ofCaptain in the Army.After he became a Satanic Priest, and while a Captain in the Armystationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, he established a Satanic Grotto inLouisville. There is no Grotto in Santa Barbara, he says.Aquino won’t give statistics on the Church’s current membership, buthe says, “It passed the 10,000 mark in 1970 and continues to grow, in spiteof the fact that approximately one out of ten applicants is accepted. Wenever solicit members.” 874 The questionnaire, which seeks such informationas description of car, home, and parental preference, he explains, attempts“to weed out the nuts from the well-balanced. We don’t want sex maniacs orbigots. Nor are minors accepted.”The basic doctrine of this church of non-religion is contained inLaVey’s Satanic Bible, described as an “inverted gospel” in the Time story.The book seems diabolically calculated to set a God-loving soul aquiver. ToSatan are attributed such quotes as: “I break away from all conventions thatdo not lead to my Earthly success and happiness. I question all things. As Istand before the festering and varnished facades of your haughtiest moraldogmas, I write thereon in letters of blazing scorn: Lo and behold, all this isfraud.“Life is the great indulgence, death the great abstinence. Thereforemake the most of life - here and now! Blessed are the strong, for theyshall possess the Earth. Cursed are the weak, for they shall inherit theyoke!” Says LaVey in the book, “Satan represents opposition to all religionswhich serve to frustrate and condemn man for his natural instincts. He hasbeen given an evil role simply because he represents the carnal, earthy, andmundane aspects of life.”Staunchly refuting accusations that Satanists worship evil, Aquinoexplains, “We perceive Satan as the personification of mankind raised todivine status. What we worship is the potential majesty of our race on itsown strength. We do not grant the existence of an absolute standard ofmorality.”Neither, apparently, are they concerned about an afterlife. “We cansay,” says Aquino, “that the individual literally controls the Universe,because when he dies everything is effectively blotted out. Everyone is thecenter of his own perceptual universe. He carries it around with him.”874 True except for the “10,000” figure, by this time used routinely for P/Rpurposes.- 1178 -Noting that Satanist doctrine encourages indulgence rather thanabstinence, he says, “We view the Judæo-Christian tradition as death-worship, because it puts an emphasis on life after death. We worship lifeand aren’t interested in an afterlife,” which he says is why he doubts thatSatanism could become a mass philosophy. “That’s just too big a bite formost people to swallow.”Not surprisingly, the Church of Satan has been bitterly denounced byreligious leaders of all faiths concerned with a resurgence of interest indevil-worship. LaVey’s followers assert themselves as a sort of elite in themovement, defending their organization’s ethical standards and their card-carrying followers against other self-proclaimed Satanists who give them abad name by robbing churches or sacrificing animals.The Church of Satan disassociates itself, according to Aquino, from“occult faddists who reject the tremendous amount of knowledge we have atour disposal for primitive explanations of natural phenomena. The Satanistritualizes, and thereby identifies and controls his illogical, humanindulgences.” The costumed rituals purport to conjure the likes of lust,curse, help, and sympathy.“Few academicians would say it works,” reflects Aquino on theemployment of the so-called Black Arts, “but I’ve seen these things work -whether it’s a form of mental projection or simply the power of suggestion -I have seen results.”The majority of the ceremonies, he says, “are bizarre dramatizations ofGothic horror, vivid displays of pyrotechnics and optical illusions, andsubtle probes into the repressed desires of the human mind.”Most infamous, perhaps, is the Black Mass, which LaVey in his SatanicBible describes as “essentially a parody on the religious service of theRoman Catholic Church” which would be used by the Satanist only “as aform of psychodrama”.Blatantly blasphemous, the script, written by the High Priest himself,calls for a nude woman to serve as an altar. But in practice, says Aquino,variations of altars are used. If a nude woman is used, he says, it is alwayswith her consent, and “nobody may touch the altar girl”. Women ratherthan men are preferred to be honored as altars, he explains, because oftheir “passive, receptive, Earth-image”.Ceremonies are limited to 20 or 30, he says, “because the wholekeynote of Satanic ritual is that everyone becomes involved”.Ordained in 1970, Aquino has attained a rather elite status in theorganization, holding the fourth in the five magical degrees of the Church.- 1179 -The degrees are Satanist I°, Witch or Warlock II°, Priest of Mendes III°,Magister IV°, and Magus V° (which, of course, is held by LaVey). Althoughthe organization is nonprofit, Aquino relates, “We voted to reject tax-exempt status, because we don’t believe any church should be tax-exempt -a benefit by exclusion.” 875As he methodically deals out color photographs of Satanist functions,he notes one of LaVey greeting a young goat at the Santa Barbara Zoo.When an apparent fetish for black is mentioned, he grins devilishly: “We’reall Gothic monsters at heart.”875 No such “vote” was held. After the LaVeys decided in 1971 not to submitChurchrecords to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status, this statementbecamethe official one for public statements.- 1180 -- 1181 -Appendix 91: Statement for The Occult Explosion- by Anton Szandor LaVey1973To us “Satan” is a symbol rather than an anthropomorphic being,although many members of the Church of Satan who are mystically inclinedprefer to think of Satan in a very real, anthropomorphic way. Of course wedo not discourage this, because we realize that it is very important to manyindividuals to ritualistically conceptualize a well-wrought picture of theirmentor or tutelary divinity. Symbolically, however, Satan is the teacher: theinformer of the whys and wherefores of the world. In answer to those whowould label us “Devil worshippers” or be very quick to assume us to beSatan worshippers, I must say that Satan demands study, not worship.We do not grovel; we do not get down on our knees, genuflect, andworship Satan. We do not plead, we do not implore that Satan give us whatwe wish. We feel that anyone who is going to be blessed by any god of hischoice is going to have to show that god that he is capable of taking care ofthe blessings that are received.The Church of Satan is an organization which is comprised of Satanistswho, because of their abilities and lifestyles - and I must stress lifestyles -reflect a higher than average human potential. Through this avenue - theChurch of Satan - the Satanist will become the prototype for a morerational, certainly a more finely tuned society.The media have stressed our nude altars. The nude altar is an integralpart of the Satanic service, and with good reason: The nude altar representsman’s fleshly heritage - the very Earth, the mother, the womb whence hecame. And we feel that there’s nothing “bawdy”, there’s nothing“licentious”, there’s nothing “lewd” about the nude woman who’s employedfor the altar. We also feel that there’s nothing wrong with bawdiness, withlicentiousness, or with any type of sexual activity; but we feel that the ritualchamber is no place for it, either overtly or covertly. And there’s no need tobe surreptitious in our ritual insofar as sexual predilections are concerned.For centuries both churchmen and laymen have been defining the Devilaccording to their needs, all the while playing the game of muzzling theenemy. They’ve been inventing the rules of how devils should behave, howSatanists should behave, how Devil-worshippers should act. And they havebeen in an authoritative position to do this, because naturally they are themen of God, the men of the church. Supposedly they are the men who havebeen doing battle with this Devil and have been absolving their- 1182 -parishioners of this Devil’s promptings. In this manner they havemaintained a convenient means by which to escape the blame for theirinadequacies or indiscretions.“The Devil made me do it” has always been a stock alibi. Once it held,and held very firm. Now, fortunately - fortunately for us - it has becomeludicrous to say, “The Devil made me do it.” Yet many, while laughing, stillplay the old game of self-deceit and blame the Devil in one way or another.So the old game is still going on. This is made amply clear in, of all places,the very world of the occult. “Witches”, who held the Devil’s name forcenturies, now refute Satanism with a passion, employing it as the otherside of the fence. All manner of occultists, from ESP researchers to faithhealers, denounce Satanists as worthless, meaningless, dangerous, adnauseam. Never is there to be found a positive adjective about Satanists.We Satanists smile at such transparencies - for they are transparentopinions; their motivations are most clear. It shows that even those whonow claim emancipation from inquisitors need devils themselves, in orderto make their art more palatable to others.Ironically the masters of the world have always been Satanists. Themasters of magic have always practiced Satanic magic - that is to say,magic without the trappings of self-deceit, for self-deceit is always aninhibiting factor in the ultimate success of a magical rite.The great Devil’s advocates of the past - Friedrich Nietzsche, MarkTwain, Herbert Spencer, H.G. Wells, Shaw, Bierce - were all able to hold alooking-glass up to man. But man, momentarily viewing his self-deceitupon reading the works of these people, could quickly avert his gaze andfind solace in his spurious rule-books. The time for an organization ofdevils had not yet come. Only a strong, organized movement could force themirror of self-revealing before the world’s eyes and hold it there. And thisis what we wish to do: hold that mirror up!It has been said that the most powerful thing in the world is an ideawhose time has come ’round. The idea that the “enemy” might conceivablyhave something worthwhile to say is now with us. In fact, is that demonwithin each of us really an enemy, as we have so long been taught? Or willit be recognized as the guiding spirit of enlightenment which it actually is?You must remember that the word Daimon does not imply “evil”, butsimply a “guiding spirit”, a “motivating spirit”.Man must quit kidding himself. Only when he emancipates himselffrom dubious interpretations of good and evil - when he can truly riseabove good and evil, beyond good and evil, realizing that these terms are- 1183 -probably the most relative terms in his existence; when he can accept thelong, obscene name of “Satan” [because that is a dirty word, “Satan” - theoccult world seems to find it even more so]; when he can accept this word,this name into his vocabulary as a sound to be honored - then he will befree! Until then he will walk in fear of the very scapegoat he has created,and his potential guide will remain his nemesis.[Interviewer question: “How would Satanism help one to rise to ahigher mental level?”]Satanism allows us to recognize and to realize our own potential, torealize that man is not created equal and that each must make the most ofwhat he has, according to his own opportunity and natural ability. But hemust also realize that he can’t force cards into his computer that will not beprogrammed - that will be rejected. As a Satanist who knows this and whorealizes his own potential, he must eventually - and here is one of theessential points of Satanism - attain his own godhead in accordance withthat potential. Therefore each man, each woman is a god or goddess inSatanism - but must never make the mistake of assuming that there maynot be another god or goddess next door who may be a little stronger.We feel that Satanism is a religion of life rather than death. I can’tunderstand why some of our detractors seem so impelled - or compelled -to establish Satanism as a religion of death, because nothing could befurther from the truth. Satanism advocates that life should be lived to thefullest - that one should get every drop of enjoyment from this life. Webelieve that this is the best of all known possible worlds. If there’s a betterone, then it will be Satanists - or Satanically inspired scientists - who findit.We feel that life is the great indulgence, death the great abstinence. I’vemade this very clear in the Satanic Bible, and yet there are still many whomaintain that Satanism is death-worship.So you might say that Satanism is a gateway to a new and morevigorous life for the individual who is struggling under the burden ofdepression.The greatest misconception about Satanism concerns human sacrifice.People tend to overlook the fact that a curse can be thrown without anyblood being shed by the magician or his chosen victim. The Satanist acceptshuman life as a very precious thing, albeit wasted on some individuals, andwe feel that there is nothing inherently wrong with anyone who just livesand allows others to live according to their own dictates. Nevertheless- 1184 -curses have to be thrown. A curse is a symbolic act. This means that it givesvent to one’s anger, one’s emotions. And if it is directed properly towardsthe victim, that victim then suffers accordingly. Such is the power ofceremonial magic.- 1185 -Appendix 92: “Satanism”- by John A. Ferro IV°in The Devil is Alive and Well and Living in America Todayby Jason Michaels (New York: Award Books #AQ1137, 1973)The current vogue which has promoted all aspects of the occult intocommercially lucrative ventures inevitably produced an enormousproliferation of dramatic presentations and publications, ranging from theharmlessly ludicrous to the most tawdry of vulgar sensationalism.Concurrently much serious analysis and much credible work is beingdone, both fictional and nonfictional. Whether the product be lamentableor laudable, the so-called occult revolution is with and upon us. It could nothave occurred unless a real need were being met.There has been manifested on the part of many in our society,especially the young, a desire to explore those aspects of their being and ofreality which have been to a great extent ignored in a culture which soexclusively values the rational, empirical approach. This is not, of course, toadvocate repudiation of that tradition, but rather to assert that at its best anapproach based upon the conclusions of speculative thought and observablephenomena does not encompass the totality of life, and that man, indemythologizing his world, has lost something of great meaning and value.Myth and ritual enable man to reascend to beginnings, to experiencethe universe in a manner impossible for the empiricist. Magic is a very realand potent force, a fact to which such distinguished men as Hermann Hesseand Carl Jung bear ample testimony.Magic is the essence of both Witchcraft and Satanism. The two are notnecessarily interrelated, but resemble each other in many ways. Becauseboth are complex subjects, and because the information available on themis unusually diverse and contradictory, simple explanations of theirdifferences and similarities are virtually impossible, if indeed they aredesirable. Even when the two are considered together, however, it is stillpossible to recognize a number of central themes which may be labeled“Satanism”.Satanism is not necessarily a Western phenomenon, but its popularappearance, especially when focused upon the figure of Satan, belongswithin the religious and intellectual traditions of the Western world.Dualism, the apparent conflict between the forces of light and darkness,and between spirit and matter, is a central problem in all the great religioussystems. The problem becomes especially difficult within the context of the- 1186 -rigid monotheism which evolved in the Judæo-Christian tradition. Infusedwith a generous portion of the extreme dualism found in the doctrines ofPersian Zoroastrianism and its offspring, Manicheanism and Gnosticism,the development of a satan, or adversary of the Old Testament into Satan,the Adversary, the mighty Prince of Darkness, is easy to understand.About this Satan the remnants of paganism, the devotees of the OldGods, those who in one form or another rebelled against the domineering,demanding presence of the Christian church would later group themselves.If they did not choose to acknowledge that their allegiance was to Satan, thealliance was made for them in the minds who did. Here, in ambiguouslysimple terms, is the essential beginning of the varieties of Satanism foundin the modern world.We need not dwell upon this point. Recent mass murders and ritualmassacres provide irrefutable, painful evidence that not only many ignorantand disgusting acts are perpetrated in the name of Satanism, but brutallydestructive crimes as well. The existence of groups devoted to such acts canscarcely be denied, but I am convinced that it would be just as irrationaland erroneous to dismiss Satanism in the modern world on these grounds,as to judge the Christian church on the basis of the horrors it hasperpetrated during two thousand years by ignorant and fanatical elementswithin its ranks.I believe we must rather seek to understand what Satanism, apart fromthe aberrations of imbeciles, the unbalanced, and the drug-dementedmeans in the modern world. It is my contention that Satanism indeedpossesses a powerful message for modern man.I regard the figure of Satan as the personification of the “dark” aspectsof reality, the earthy, and the carnal, human qualities that so many in themodern world have been unable to accept and integrate into their lives.Victimized by a tradition and a personal conditioning which ignored orvilified the dark and the carnal, they spend years, if not entire lives ofdesperation and self-alienation attempting to understand and relate to abody and a world of matter.The mighty Prince of Darkness, the lord of this world, is a symbol, apersonified force to which many can relate. Satan is also the arch-rebel. Heurges men to cast off decadent and life-denying conventions. He is thearchetype of individual assertion, of the mind that holds no truth to beabove the question; by extension Satan is the harbinger of freedom andemancipation. Even so devout, if unorthodox a Christian as John Miltoncreated a Satan who was the most majestic figure in his Paradise Lost.- 1187 -Though infrequently considered in this context, Satanism today mayrepresent a potent, humanizing influence. By its emphatic assertion thatman’s baser impulses are very human - not intrinsically evil - Satanism setsitself in direct and unmistakable opposition to the proponents of self-hateand self-denial.Anton Szandor LaVey, a man for whom I have the greatest respect andfrom whom I have learned much, is not only an extremely knowledgeableand intelligent individual, but one who possesses uncanny ability to turn aclever phrase. He has frequently said that “man must learn to exerciserather than exorcise his demons”. This sound, psychological statement isquite compatible with current trends in the field.Man must learn to incorporate those forces which have commonly beencalled demonic. In traditional thought and legend, the demonic forces aresaid to be dangerous and destructive, a formidable hazard to those whowould tamper with them. Let us rephrase this in contemporary terms: Whatcould be more destructive psychologically than those forces or aspects ofour personality which we would deny and suppress?As previously suggested, the question of personal freedom, rebellionagainst senseless restrictions, of individual responsibility is relevant here.The Satan-figure is a rebel, whose rebellion is not to be found in the pagesof Scripture, and which is scarcely a theological essential. In some historicalmanifestations, and certainly within the modern context, Satanismespouses a repudiation - not of all restraint and social responsibility, but ofuseless conventions and life-denying ordinances. Personally I cannotescape the conclusion that the opposite of Satanism is not religion butPuritanism, that philosophy which hates life and embraces theauthoritarian, legislative restriction of personal morality.In my study and analysis I have come to agree with William ButlerYeats, who regarded the Devil as the reverse side of God. Like Hesse andAldous Huxley, and so many figures of similar insight and vision, I havecome to see something beyond a fragmented reality, that God and the Devilare really two component parts, or rather complementary aspects of thesame profound and all-encompassing reality.- 1188 -- 1189 -Appendix 93: Central Grotto Exorcist Bulletin- by Anton and Diane LaVeyFebruary IX/1974The first month of the Year Nine has shown that this is indeed going tobe the year of the Ego! Satan grabbed the spotlight in grand fashion andstrapped the Almighty’s crew into the hot seat, all in the same motion.Lord, are their faces red. By now any self-respecting Machiavellian knowswe’re referring to that tidy little job The Exorcist. Most office time for thepast six weeks has been spent hanging on to this dragon’s tale and guidingit in the right direction. Perhaps the following “Possession Kit” descriptionwill help you appreciate the tenor of Central’s atmosphere of late:* OFFICIAL CHURCH OF SATAN POSSESSION KIT *WOW!! AMAZE YOUR FRIENDS! -- $29.95 includes:• Lexicon (handbook) of dirty words.• “Ventrilo” device to make unearthly sounds [slips unnoticed into mouth].• Ten-pound sack of simulated poo-poo to smear on body and face.• One gallon of mottled green and black simulated vomit [pleasantlyflavored].• “Break-apart” crucifix [no sharp edges].• One pint aniline dye - will stain anything.• Spool of invisible thread to yank objects.• Five mini-stink bombs.DON’T DELAY - IMAGINE THE EXPRESSION ON YOUR FRIENDS’ FACESAS THEY WATCH YOUR ANTICS!When the hoopla over The Exorcist first hit, we really didn’t mind allthe extra work it created for us. After awhile, though, the fun began to wearoff and it became something of a grind. Dr. LaVey, true to form, came upwith an antidote that our waning sense of humor couldn’t resist. Actually hehad done it for his own amusement, but Mrs. LaVey found it and brought itto Central, where we conspired with her to get copies printed up and sent toa few people who we thought would enjoy it.[It would seem we should have included the notorious “Zodiac”, whonow boasts a total of 37 victims, in our mailing. He apparently shares Dr.LaVey’s amusement with The Exorcist. After a silence of two and a halfyears, “Zodiac’s” first communiqué - sent to the San Francisco Chronicle -opened with: “I saw and think The Exorcist was the best saterical comidythat I have ever seen.”]- 1190 -Dr. LaVey said he thought we were making much ado about nothingand complained that it “looks like hell” because what was red highlightingin the original looks [in the photocopy] “like it was done by a chimp!” Ourenthusiasm is apparently shared by others, Dr. LaVey’s artistic vanitynotwithstanding. We’ve heard that copies are being made of our copies andcirculated with great relish around T.V. studios, several major motionpicture lots, college campuses, and even a couple of cities’ policedepartments. Now what do we do if we start getting orders?An interesting sidelight to this whole possession/exorcism business isthe proximity to the Central Grotto of the priest (Father Patzelt) who hasprobably brought more embarrassment to the Catholic Church than anyother aspect of the entire issue. You’ll recall that he is the chap who takesexorcism quite seriously, having performed one for a Daly City, Californiafamily a couple of years ago. Father Patzelt’s Our Lady of Fatima Church isbut two short blocks away from Central! Don’t ask us if Dr. LaVey is seriouswhen he says he “possessed” the doddering old boy to make a holy fool ofhimself [and his brothers of the cloth in the bargain]. We can say only thatthe Magus’ amber eyes shine darkly and his smile becomes sardonicwhenever someone asks him if he finds it “ironic” that of all of theclergymen in the country, contemporary Christianity’s prize buffoon turnedout to live practically in the “Devil’s backyard”.At least poor old Father Patzelt is an honest loon. We can’t say thesame for Blatty, whose overbearing, self-righteous arrogance makes himone of the best candidates we’ve seen for a pie-in-the-face or a kick-me-signsince Jeane Dixon. If he were prudent, he would get down on his knees andthank Satan for the riches He has brought him. Instead he’s even denyingthat the current popularity of the occult has anything to do with his success.“Blatty grumbled: ‘I’m sick of hearing that the movie is a success because ofa rediscovery of the occult. A thousand or more books have been written onthe occult in the last ten years - they’ve each sold about ten copies.’” - Time,2/11. So he doesn’t keep making a fool of himself, someone should tell Mr.Blatty that the Satanic Bible has sold roughly 1-1/2 million copies. Heprobably wouldn’t hear them anyway: “Don’t confuse me with facts; mymind is made up.” He is not very smart. Perhaps he’ll receive evidencefirsthand that his glib wish “I would like to think that somebody down theredoesn’t like me” has been granted.- 1191 -Appendix 94: Priesthood/Regional AgentsExorcism Fact Sheet- by Michael A. Aquino IV°January 22, IX/1974At this time The Exorcist, a film based upon Blatty’s novel of the samename, is premiering in certain major cities around the United States.According to preliminary indications which have reached us, it is definitelya smash hit. Predictably there is a contemporary public interest in mattersrelative to exorcism. Several exorcists - Catholic and otherwise - have comeinto the limelight. Many individuals have suddenly decided that they are“possessed” by Dæmonic forces, if not by the Devil himself.Since you are almost certain to be questioned on this subject - andsince this entire episode contains aspects which may be turned to thematerial advantage of the Church of Satan - I have assembled some datawhich you may or may not choose to use. If you have any questions whichyou cannot resolve through your own research, you are welcome to write tome with appropriate details.To date I have come across at least two page-#1 news stories onexorcism - one in the San Francisco Chronicle (1/21) and one in the LosAngeles Times (1/19). Here is a brief summary of each:Chronicle: Catholic Archbishop Joseph T. McGucken is attempting toavoid press questions concerning the supposed exorcism of the home of ayoung family in Daly City, a suburb of San Francisco. The ceremony tookplace subsequent to May of 1972, after the family had complained of theunexplained burning or breakage of various articles of furniture. In chargeof the exorcism was Father Karl Patzelt, currently en route to New York foran appearance on the N.B.C. Today Show. He is 57 years old and a Jesuit.One of Patzelt’s aides has stated: “God afforded the family enough graceand strength to endure whatever came. But he wasn’t going to permit theDevil to harm these people or their home. He made sure someone washome to take precautions against the house going up in flames.” This givesyou a rough idea of the sophistication of the clerics involved. Since thepublicity began, many churches in the San Francisco area have beenplagued with callers who desire to be exorcised. The Catholics have thegrace to be embarrassed by all of this.Times: The Exorcist is currently being shown in 24 major U.S. cities.Part of the film was made at Washington, D.C.’s Georgetown University.Mention is made of the famous “possession” of the nuns at Loudun in 1635.- 1192 -The Exorcist is purportedly based upon the case of a 14-year-old Mt.Ranier, Maryland boy exorcised by Jesuit priest William Bowdern in 1949.A Dr. H.A. Kelly, author of The Devil, Demonology, and Witchcraft and anEnglish professor at U.C.L.A., has doubts about the objective existence ofdæmons. He has studied in the Jesuit order for 13 years and hasinterviewed Bowdern. He feels that the “possessed” boy was simply subjectto a conventional illness. He says: “Dæmon possession, like other forms oftrances, is often pathological. Dæmons should be classified with diseases.”Dr. W.J. Asper, Chairman of the Religion Department at the CaliforniaLutheran College in Thousand Oaks, disagrees. He believes that possessionis literally true.On the whole, the Roman Catholic Church is extremely cautious aboutauthorizing exorcisms. The secretary to Cardinal Timothy Manning of LosAngeles says that no exorcism has been performed in that area for at leastthe past ten years. According to Catholic practices, only a bishop mayauthorize a priest to perform an exorcism. Such a priest must be of“profound prayer life and distinct holiness”.In Houston this last month a Catholic priest performed an informalexorcism on an abandoned house known as “Devil’s Corner”. Workmen hadbeen frightened by strange noises at the site. The building had supposedlybeen the locale for pagan worship some time ago.Last year Pope Paul devoted a speech to Satan, describing him asfollows: “A dark and enemy agent … a terrible, mysterious, and fearsomereality … a live, spiritual, perverted, and perverting being … the enemyNumber One, the tempter par excellence … the hidden enemy who sowserrors and misfortunes in human history”. The Pope made it clear that hewas not speaking figuratively.Dr. Rodman Williams, president of the Melodyland School of Theologyin Anaheim (Los Angeles suburb) is a fundamentalist who believes in literalpossession. He says, “In the murky depths of human personality there is adark force at work that can only be expelled through the power of the gospeland Jesus Christ.” He took part in a “successful” exorcism several years agowhile a professor of theology at Texas’ Austin Presbyterian Seminary.Hal Lindsey, author of Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth [2million sold] and a resident of Pacific Palisades (L.A.), claims to haveconducted a successful exorcism. Together with most other theist clericsquestioned, Lindsey advises people against going to see The Exorcist. Hesays, “We are entering a new dimension with The Exorcist. Satan is using- 1193 -fear and intimidation to maneuver and manipulate. There is supernaturalpower operative in this movie.”As you can see from the contents of these two newspaper articles, it’s apretty silly business all the way around. At the moment it’s well on the wayto becoming the latest national fad, but in the long run it can’t help butmake theism look just that much more childish. The conventional churchesare torn between two extremes. On one hand they find it hard to resist theinstant popularity accorded them via interest in exorcism. On the otherthey would much rather the public come to them due to interest in JesusChrist and not the Devil. But the Devil gets more press attention. When wasthe last time a Catholic priest was flown to New York for a Today Showappearance to discuss his usual gobbledegook?Instead of waiting for the press to come to your door, you should takethe initiative to discuss the Satanic position concerning exorcism. We - notthe Catholics or the fundamentalists - are the authorities on Dæmonology.This is a major public relations opportunity for the Church of Satan, one ofwhich we should not fail to take full advantage. How you choose toapproach the subject is up to you; in this as in other doctrinal matters weproclaim no dogma. For your reference only, here is the text of a letter Ihave written in response to the L.A. Times article:“I have read your article on exorcism in the 1/19 Times withconsiderable interest. I suppose that it is inevitable that the popularity ofThe Exorcist should lead to a sudden proliferation of people who considerthemselves ‘possessed’ by Dæmonic entities.“What turns my stomach, however, are the efforts of modern ‘tentshow’ evangelists to turn this development to their personal profit. As usualthey prey upon the old, the weak, and the trusting to feather their ownfinancial nests. They are a disgusting breed of human being.“As for exorcism: To my way of thinking it makes about as much senseto consult a theist cleric on Dæmonology as it does to ask a virgin for adviceconcerning the pleasures of sex. I have been in touch with the CatholicChurch’s official exorcist in Washington, D.C., Father John Nicola. Hisprocedures for combating Our Lord Satan appear to include the intoning ofimpotent prayers over such psychokinetic phenomena as pianos whichmove by themselves. An actual Dæmon would pay not the slightest heed toexorcist theatrics. Why should he? The threats are superstitious nonsense.“In fact Dæmons rarely possess human beings, having nothing to gainfrom doing so. ‘Possession’ is rather a semi-hysterical surfacing of theindividual’s own repressed desires and lusts, normally imprisoned within- 1194 -the subconscious by moral indoctrination. Such an outburst, obviouslymisunderstood and feared by the ‘normal’ person, constitutes an expressionof the True Self.“One of the purposes of the Church of Satan is the freeing of thisDæmonic personality under conditions which are controlled by theSatanist. Such an experience has a twofold effect: First, it relaxes andreinforces the entire personality, which otherwise would be in perpetualconflict with itself. And secondly, it gradually endows the practitioner withpowers of will and concentration previously unknown to him.“What is the real reason behind the popularity of The Exorcist? Is itonly that people are morbid and like to see a little girl subjected to varioussorts of abuse? No doubt this is a factor. But I rather suspect a certainwishful thinking on their part - that they too could indulge in, rather thanabstain from their hidden compulsions.”The January-February Cloven Hoof will carry a brief discussion of theExorcist boom on page #1. You will see that certain items from this factsheet are included, but in a superficial manner. I have not issued a general“call to arms” on this, because I don’t want some well-meaning butinexperienced member putting his foot in it. An ill-considered statementfrom a Satanist on this subject could make us look just as foolish as thetheists. If we are careful in our choice of words, we will emerge as thecommonsense alternative to the paranoid superstitions of our opponents.As III° and II° recipients, you are considered to be accomplished magicians- which is why you have authority delegated to you to represent the Churchof Satan in your respective areas. Now is the time to prove it. Seize theinitiative, don’t let go, and keep the Central Grotto and myself informed ofany problems and/or successes.Good luck and good hunting …Rege Satanas!Michael A. AquinoMagister Templi IV°Last minute update: On the N.B.C. Tomorrow Show this morning, fourCatholic priests were interviewed: Richard Woods (an occult specialist fromChicago’s Loyola University), William O’Malley (who appeared in TheExorcist), Patzelt, and a Father Ryan (Georgetown University). Patzelt is alittle old fellow who, in addition to looking like Raymond Buckland, talkson that character’s intellectual level. Sounds to me as though he wereplayed for a sucker in Daly City. The two best comments were made by- 1195 -Woods [“If I suspected someone were possessed, I’d consult twopsychiatrists - one for him and one for me.”] … and by O’Malley, anobviously fun-loving Irishman [“I agreed to help make The Exorcistbecause I’ve always had a thing about movies … you might say that theDevil made me do it.”]From the show it was obvious that these officials knew next-to-nothingabout Dæmonology or the Black Arts save the exorcism ritual itself.Contesting them would be like shooting fish - no allegory intended - in abarrel.- 1196 -- 1197 -Appendix 95: “Honest, The Devil Really Did Make MeDo It, -or-Is There an Exorcist in the House?”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #VI-1, January/February IX/1974Suddenly everyone is talking about exorcism, or - to be more specific -The Exorcist. The motion picture version of William P. Blatty’s novel iscurrently premiering in 24 cities across the United States and Canada, andeven now - weeks after the opening - the queues continue to stretch forblocks. Young ladies “faint” in theater lobbies, and church officials areswamped by appeals from individuals who suddenly believe themselves“possessed”. Via the sort of irony in which the Devil delights, Christianityhas again found itself popular - this time not by a folk-rock musical on theGospel, but by a novel laced with the coarsest possible language anddescribing the sexual/sadistic abuse of a little child! There is a moral hereconcerning the mental state of those who have imprisoned themselves inthe psychological straitjacket of Christian morality.Each day the Exorcist mania seems to attain new heights of idiocy.According to The Tidings, official newspaper of the Catholic Church in theU.S., the archbishop in Denver has been besieged with pleas for exorcisms -including one from a man who was found screaming in the cathedralalleyway after seeing the film. In Bloomfield Hills, Michigan appeals forexorcisms included one from a policeman who “fainted” in the theaterlobby. A priest in Houston was summoned to exorcise a house known as“Devil’s Corner”, wherein strange noises terrified workmen. Los Angelesevangelist Hal Lindsey, author of the best-selling piece of hysteria Satan is"},{"pageContent":"Alive and Well on Planet Earth, said, “We are entering a new dimensionwith The Exorcist. Satan is using fear and intimidation to maneuver andmanipulate. There is supernatural power operative in this movie.” [Heclaims, by the way, to have personally performed two exorcisms.] MartinEbon scoops the paperback competition with his new anthology Exorcism:Fact, Not Fiction, and Ouija boards are setting new sales records.While our Canadian Agents report that the film is being greeted with ayawn up there, Reverend Robert Ethel tells us that Washington, D.C. (thesetting for the story) is going berserk. “As far as I know,” he sighs, “no T-shirts have been issued yet!” Official Washington exorcist Father JohnNicola has taken it on the lam to Rome, Italy, where he is presumably- 1198 -continuing work on his announced memoirs of possessed pianos, etc. Hesays, “I think kids today are trying to find if there are spiritual realities,andthis [the film] will help.” Father James Cichon in Michigan disagrees: “I cansee absolutely no good coming from the movie. If anybody takes kids to seeit, they (sic) are out of their minds.” Cornered by slavering reporters in NewYork City, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury evidently had hisfundamental back to the wall: “I believe there is a genuine demonicpossession and genuine exorcism.” Concerning the film he remarked,“Fiddlesticks!”But far and away the funniest anecdote comes, as one might expect,from San Francisco. Some enterprising journalists discovered that theresident nut of the local Catholic clergy, one Father Patzelt, receivedpermission to exorcise a suburban family about two years ago. The“manifestations” were so ridiculous [i.e. sandwiches that ate themselves,etc.] that anyone with an I.Q. over 5 would have recognized the thing to be agag. But the news media jumped on the story, and the little priest [wholooks rather like Raymond Buckland] suddenly found himself a celebrity.N.B.C. whisked him off to New York to make an ass of himself on theTomorrow Show (1/22) before his embarrassed archbishop J.T. McGuckencould tackle him and lock him up in a woodshed. In a last-ditch effort tosalvage the situation, the Catholics sent three other priests to the show.This didn’t help a whole heck of a lot. Father Richard Woods, a supposedexpert on the occult from Chicago’s Loyola University, said, “If I suspectedpossession, I’d send the victim to a psychiatrist and then consult anotherone for myself.” Father William O’Malley, a merry Irishman, explained hisappearance in The Exorcist thus: “The Devil made me do it!”All in all, the Catholics would really like to crawl under the rug rightnow - except for the fact that they’re “caught between the Devil and theHoly See” [pun for Satanists over 30]. Paul VI is a dæmonic fundamentalistwho has come out firmly on behalf of the Devil’s literal existence. “A darkand enemy agent … a terrible, mysterious, and fearsome reality … a live,spiritual, perverted, and perverting being … the enemy Number One, thetempter par excellence, the hidden enemy who sows errors and misfortunesin human history”. So the Holy Father’s henchmen can hardly cop out andterm the entire business a medieval allegory! What a delightful mess! Butthe best is still to come. We Satanists happen to be the real authorities onDæmonology. And our Priests, Priestesses, and Regional Agents are justnow beginning to issue their own statements to the press concerning themania. On the whole they are deliciously rational and logical. Your local- 1199 -Agent can most likely bring you up-to-date on some of this, so get in touchwith him or her. And, to see where this diabolical little roller-coaster isheaded, turn to the High Priest’s message in this issue of the Cloven Hoof.- 1200 -- 1201 -Appendix 96: “To Satanists, Exorcism Silly”- by Willys PeckThe Mercury, San Jose, California, January 28, 1974If you’re looking for the subject of an exorcism, skip the Church ofSatan. He isn’t there. This is the word from the head of San Jose’s onlybranch of the denomination which, since its founding eight years ago in SanFrancisco, has stirred reactions ranging from curiosity to outrage.If you encountered Priestess Bast of Bubastis Chapel in, say, asupermarket, you’d no doubt put her down as a suburban housewife, whichshe is, or a PTA president, which she isn’t. She’s 33, a college graduate, andworks at a skilled trade, as does her husband. Beyond that she asked toremain anonymous for interview purposes, feeling as she does that herneighbors would not be accepting of her role in an organization thatseemingly has gone out of its way to invite the condemnation of establishedreligion.Link “church” and “Satan” affirmatively, and the natural inference todraw is that of devil-worshipper. Nor is one disabused of this notion whenone reads in the Satanic Bible the following invocation: “In the name ofSatan, the ruler of the Earth, the king of the world, I command the forces ofDarkness to bestow their infernal power upon me. Open wide the gates ofHell, and come forth from the Abyss to greet me as your brother [sister]and friend …”Pretty heavy stuff for the folks back home, and a sensitive soul can wellnigh hear that guarantor of religious freedom, the First Amendment,creaking at the seams. However, says Priestess Bast, whose name is derivedfrom the Egyptian cat goddess and who shall be referred to simply as Bast,this really isn’t the way things are. Satanists don’t worship any being in thecosmic sense. “Satan,” she has explained in a leaflet for public distribution,“is the name Satanists have given to the natural force that rules the world,and that represents man and man’s nature.”Putting it another way, Satanists take those qualities that otherreligions condemn as sinful - lust, pride, anger, sloth, etc. - and hold themup as human traits that, in themselves, are not harmful. God, in the Satanicdoctrine, can best be stated: “Do what you will, as long as no undeservingperson is harmed by your actions.” God, in the Satanic scheme of things, issimply “the balancing factor in nature … not … a being concerned withsuffering,” to quote the Satanic Bible.- 1202 -As Bast put it: “A Satanist knows he is capable of performing everyaction attributable to the gods of spiritual religions; each Satanist is his owngod.” Given these tenets, said Bast, “demonic possession would beimpossible.” She dismissed as “absurd” the idea of exorcism.Okay, so if Satan is not a being capable of being ousted throughexorcism, why the invocation to “come forth from the gates of Hell”?“Ritual,” explained Bast.“Ritual plays a very important part in the Satanic Church.” Through theemotional “high” one obtains through ritual - and drugs are strictlycondemned in the Satanic Church - the individual is brought to that state ofconsciousness where he can best exploit the power within him, said Bast.The results are the “magic” of Satanists.There is a ritual for the conjuration of lust, for the conjuration ofcompassion, and for the conjuration of destruction. The last involves thehex or curse popularly associated with witchcraft. “Witch” [for women] and“Warlock” [for men] are categories of membership in the church, achievedby passing an examination. The Satanic Bible warns that the conjuration ofdestruction should not be undertaken unless “you do not care if theintended victim lives or dies”. Has she ever participated in such a ritual?Twice, Bast replied. In each instance the desired result was achieved by theindividual moving out of the area, not by death or injury, she said.The Satanic Bible, written by Anton LaVey, the San Franciscan whofounded the Church of Satan, is widely available in paperback form. It is avolume whose inflamed passages hardly comport with the image of amatronly woman propelling a shopping cart along the aisles of asupermarket. But occasionally Bast will pause and attach a card to themarket bulletin board, inviting inquiries about the Church of Satan.- 1203 -Appendix 97: “Warlock Says Church Cashing in onExorcist”- by Ron RoatDaily News, Dayton, Ohio, February 24, 1974Warlock William Ashton876 says The Exorcist movie has a wishy-washyplot and is a study in nonsense. Ashton, of Kettering, is a second-degreemember of the Church of Satan. A second-degree member is called aWarlock. “The Christian church is cashing in on this movie,” said Ashton,23. “People are going in fear of the Devil instead of love of God. The realreason behind the popularity of this movie is that people really enjoy seeingmorbid things, like a little girl being subjected to abuse.”Ashton said the Christian church has spread evil about Satan and abouthis church. He says people don’t understand the church and its teachings.“Possession is not the surfacing of the Devil,” he said. “It is the expressionof the inner forces in us all. Possession should be the realization ofourselves as true gods, something that has been stifled by the Christianchurch.”The Church of Satan provides an alternative, he said. “People go to thismovie and see these powers in us and wish that they too could indulge inthese hidden compulsions.” The Church of Satan can teach people how touse these inner forces, he said, at its local meetings held twice a month.“We use these powers in our rituals.” The Church does not have an address,he said, because the rest of society would shun its members, the number ofwhich he would not discuss. He said that interested persons can write tohim using Post Office Box #424, Dayton 45401.“There is no Heaven or Hell,” he said. “We are our own gods.” TheExorcist, according to Ashton, represents every popular, negative ideaabout Satan which has been fostered by the Christian church. The Christianchurch is not the authority on Satanism. The Church of Satan is thatauthority, he contended. “How can they make a movie about something onwhich we are the authority?”Ashton said the movie indicates the Devil is concerned with destructionand death. “Nothing could be further from the truth. Satan is not themisshapen, horrible demon of Christianity,” he said.876 Thomas S. Huddleston II°.- 1204 -- 1205 -Appendix 98: “Satanist Calls Film a Boon for Christiansand Devil-Worshippers”- by Marty GuntherNational Tattler (“Exorcism Special”), Spring 1974The Exorcist has created a profitable situation for clergymen andSatanists alike, believes Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey, High Priest of theChurch of Satan, who considers himself the “Black Pope”. “This film allowsfailing priests a new role, whereby they can become heroes instead ofuseless poseurs,” he told Tattler for this special edition. “It utilizesinterestin the occult for religious ends and enables ‘white occultists’ to furthercement their compatibility with established theology,” said the SanFrancisco-based priest.“By presenting possession as a credible phenomenon, it enhances fearof the Devil, which only gives the Devil greater power over those whose fearrequirements must be met. The needs of the ‘possessed’ will supply plentyof material to be exorcised. If one can’t be an exorcist, which requirestheological credentials or at least showmanship, he can play the role of thepossessed. To be possessed requires no talent - simply either an admissionof possession or enough irrational action to elicit the attention of abystander,” LaVey contended. “For an exhibitionist, possession is muchbetter than going onstage during a hypnosis demonstration as a volunteer.It requires no stage or nightclub, but only a viewer - any viewer who hasbeen exposed to the signs of possession. Soon that will include anyone whohas read the book or seen the film or the countless variations that arealready being ground out.“What does all this mean?” LaVey asked. “Simply that there will be achance for everyone to get into the act. As well as exorcists and thepossessed, there will be plenty of room for detectors or spotters, who, likeparlor psychoanalysts of a generation ago, will have a literal field day. TheExorcist has become America’s number one cocktail party conversationopener, surpassing even astrology. Soon, as with astrology, comparingpossessions will become the main topic of conversation at block parties,”the Satanist projected. “In each crowd will be a graven-faced neighborhoodexpert, and he will serve as mediator or emcee. Of course, if the gathering isfortunate enough, the parish priest will be guest of honor. A short while agothe same cleric may well have been on his way towards either a communeor alcoholism due to extreme feelings of inadequacy or rejection.- 1206 -“The Exorcist will bring many allies into the Satanic camp who hadpreviously remained mute,” LaVey predicted. “Being a direct affront to thepsychiatric and medical profession, its members must refute the story’svalidity Of course they are quite correct in their concern for the infinitedamage the film can do to the overly impressionable, the young and theslightly imbalanced. The roles of psychologist and physician are weakenedto the public.

Don’tforget that those Catholics whose integrity forbade them from viewingRosemary’s Baby, which would have necessitated violating their religion’sban, had to wait several years to ‘accidentally’ catch it on television,” herelated. “The movie industry lost quite a bit of box office receipts on thatcaper, so it won’t happen again.“How can all this benefit Satanism? The same way the drug scene, thewelfare state, aid to the totally disabled, encampment of Jesus freaks, andother methods isolated the weak and useless from the strong and alert. It isbut a further means of separating the believer from the nonbeliever, thelower of the species from the higher.“William Peter Blatty should get down on his knees and humbly thankthe concept known as ‘Satan’ for providing him with fame and fortune,”LaVey said. “There is nothing wrong with being successful. But pioussanctimony and earthly success make a strange and unconvincing marriage,no matter how hallowed the cathedral in which it is performed.”- 1207 -Appendix 99: “The Root of All”- by Michael A.

Meanwhileinflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index shot from 10.8% inApril to 12% in June to 15.6% in August. According to a CommerceDepartment report released 9/25/74, the U.S. trade deficit rose from $728million in July to $1.13 billion in August. Bank prime lending rates havesoared to 12%, and in spite of momentary pullbacks will probably continueupward. Average wages rose 6.4% in the first quarter of 1974, then another14.2% in the second quarter. Yet the average worker’s paycheck now buys877 by M.A. Aquino IV°.- 1208 -5.3% less than it did last year after inflation and taxes. Unemployment, nowat 5.3%, is projected by Presidential advisor (and de facto Satanist - seeTime 9/30/74, page #87) Greenspan at 6.5% by the second quarter of 1975and at 8% by 1976. Mortgage rates have hit 10%+, housing starts recorded afour-year low in July, and Treasury Secretary Simon says that, even with allgovernment anti-inflation programs going full blast, substantial relief willnot occur for the next 2-5 years. As we go to press the Dow-Jones IndustrialAverage has broken below 600, and a team of curious Congressmen hastoured Fort Knox to ensure that the Gold Depository is not empty. Otherworld inflation rates: Canada 14%, Mexico 45%, Italy 19%, France 16%, andGreat Britain 20%. Nor are the communists doing much better: TheU.S.S.R. currently leads the world in industrial strikes. Finally - just tocheer you up - crime has risen 15% this last year, to the point whereAttorney General Saxbe terms it “out of control” and asks for a nationalpolice force. Saxbe also warns of new waves of vigilantism, inspired in partby the impact of the recent film Deathwish.If you have a copy of Roger Price’s The Great Roob Revolution (NY:Random House, 1970), turn now to page #144 and read the chapter entitled“Some Vaporous Predictions”. This will give you a pretty good overview ofwhat we can now expect in terms of domestic political developments.Price’s only mistake was that he overestimated the length of time it wouldtake the Roob populace to really screw things up. He projected the Dow at600 in 1976, the President out and in a hospital in 1977, and a ratherphlegmatic Vice President assuming power that same year. The real troublewith Roger Price, you see, is that he’s an optimist - wild-eyed, of course …You’re going to want to know where we go from here. Very simple.There will be many forums and councils called, many speeches made, manygrand programs launched, and much fuss made over the most nebulousindication that even one of the Rotten Statistics has made even amomentary pullback. Artificial “indices” will quietly be inserted intoinflation figures to “reduce” them by redefining them on a relative, not anabsolute basis (a technique that noted economist Harry Schultz ofAmsterdam refers to as “indexation”). But nothing substantial will beachieved, for the simple reason that society has been coasting along on theinflation/socialism roller-coaster since World War II. The Roobs havebecome fat and lazy, and they feel “entitled” to a high standard of livingwithout having to work for it. In a nutshell, socialism is the processwhereby the Roobs search out and identify the productive elements and- 1209 -then enact legislation to “redistribute” the fruit of their labors. If theycan’tdo it by legislation, they will do it by riots, robbery, or organized charity.Socialism will work only as long as the productive elements are willingto carry the Roobs along on their backs, which they will do as long as theyare able to enjoy at least a certain percentage of their own achievements.When the burden finally gets too heavy - which it will - the productiveelements will either emigrate or give up the struggle and become parasitesthemselves. Emigration has not yet taken place, simply because the UnitedStates is still less socialist than any other country, has the highest standardof living, and controls two-thirds of the world’s industrial capital. Associalism gains a constricting hold, however, there will be a backlashphenomenon of catastrophic proportions. At one extreme this may result inan Oliver Cromwell (R. Reagan? )878 , at the other a Hitler. Such a backlashhas already taken place in many nations such as Portugal and Argentina.Prime candidates are now the major powers. Keep your eye on England andItaly, two industrialized countries practically immobilized by socialism. Inthe United States it may take a little longer, but the impetus is there.Obviously we don’t have the space to give you a crash course ineconomics, so you’re going to have to put your brain in gear if you want tounderstand the detailed processes that forge the aforementioned scenario.One thing to bear in mind: In the short run politics may dictate economics,but in the long run it’s the other way around. Example: The raising of oilexport prices by OPEC was almost a foregone conclusion, because Arabdeposits in U.S. banks had just been slashed by two successive dollardevaluations on top of the already-high inflation. If you were Sheik al-Yamani, what would you have done? 879The facts of the matter are that the entire world is now entering a crisisphase the like of which has not been seen since the Great Depression.Domestic scapegoats will be sought, and war economies will be introducedand sustained by the instigation of continuous brushfire wars. In otherwords, Orwell’s 1984 is right on schedule. The speed at which this change istaking place is logarithmic, not linear, and you’re going to have to movefaster than ever to stay one jump ahead. The adept Satanist will not onlyweather the storm; he will turn it to his advantage. But you’re going to haveto think, comprehend, evaluate, and act faster than the herd. The time tobegin is right now.878 Reagan’s name deleted by Diane LaVey from the article as finally printed.879 This last sentence deleted by Diane LaVey from the article as finallyprinted.- 1210 -“Whoever takes up the sword shall perish by the sword.But whoever does not take up the sword shall perish on the cross.”- 1211 -Appendix 100: “The Abstaining Indulgers”- by R. Jzamon DeCecco II°Straight From Hell #I-1, November-December VIII/1973This particular treatise deals with practices of a most hypocriticalpeople: the Catholics.In my lifetime I have toured many streets in this country and abroad.Areas like Broadway, 42nd Street, Soho, Pigalle, Boston’s WashingtonStreet, etc. are Meccas for entertainment. These areas are predominantlypopulated by Catholics. This is sociological fact, with the possible exceptionof Soho. In spite of Christian social ethics, these lusty dens promote a greatdeal of physical indulgence. Strip shows, gambling, gay bars, prostitution,X-movie houses [incidentally, most art films are made in Catholiccountries], squalor-ridden bars, etc. line these streets in neon glory.It is alleged that most gangster-organized businesses are led by adominance of Catholics. These rackets stay in operation by deriving most oftheir business from frustrated Catholics who, after so much abstinence, goto get a cheap thrill or to release some sexual inhibition in the sordidtemples of their very brothers in religion. What helps to allow this “evil”carrying-on for the devoted is the fact that this pleasure-seeking hypocritecan, on Saturday, go to his confessor and get all this “sinning” off hisconscience. [If he hasn’t met his priest in one of those peep shows or cathouses yet, he will sooner or later.]This God-priest directs the frustrated man to recite three Ave Marias,and his “sins” will be forgiven. The man does this and upon completionknows that he can now go out and sin some more, which he invariably does.This process is repeated and repeated throughout his terror-ridden, sexlesslife. He never knows what a truly free-mind existence is.Let us now take a trip home with this fellow after one of his soireesdowntown. Sexually his suffering is enhanced when he climbs into bed withhis wife. He immediately remembers that he is supposed to make love toher for the sole purpose of having children. [Chances are that he alreadyhas one or two that he didn’t want in the first place.] This is his firstdamper. He climbs atop her, realizing that if he uses a birth-control device,he is “sinning” against his church. This is his second damper. If he decidesto use the device anyway, his feelings of guilt will probably override hisfeelings of pleasure in the act itself.His third damper comes when he wants to perform other sexual orauto-erotic acts with his mate. As much as he may want to deviate in his- 1212 -act, either he is shut off by her or he remembers that to do these thingscould bring him closer to the “gates of Hell”. He therefore does his littlescene, washes himself, and goes to sleep breathing hard, thinking about thethings he would like to have done. For he knows that if he had asked hismate to deviate in any way, she would have accused him of being some kindof nut or pervert.Since AD 1 man has generally had to live his whole life wanting but nottaking, because of an insane masochist who once stated that desire wasanother step towards brimstone. These people reach death withoutexperiencing all of the things which their minds and bodies want toexperience. To them, each man must be a Jesus. Most of these mutants feelthat they must uphold the image of a suffering Savior in order to gain akingdom populated by psychologically frustrated, morally degenerateharpists.Man feels, man wants, man desires. Man by any other name would stillbe a basic animal with natural needs and drives. To deny himself theseearthly pleasures is the most perverted act of human sacrifice that could beemployed to bring him to an organism of prey for his own wants. They areguilty of not being men at all.To indulge is to taste, to feel, to know, and to truly love. Man will neverknow himself enough so that he can begin to solve his problems, unless heknows who and what he is and, mainly, what he wants. He is a tool of lustand intellect. He must realize his desires. If he does not use these tools, hewill not build himself so that he can build others. Man alone steers his ship,and man alone will sink it if he doesn’t indulge in his own ego-pleasureswith a free mind.So to all these weak, frustrated Catholics I give my sardonic un-blessing. They are not human; they are slaves to abstinence. Animalswithout sex organs. Food to be eaten by the Satanist!- 1213 -Appendix 101: Extract from “Satan is Back”- by William P. WhikehamPlain Truth (Worldwide Church of God), March 1974In Italy Black Magic is thriving as thousands of soothsayers,clairvoyants, and astrologers continue to do a booming business. Accordingto the French publication Lectures Pour Tous (May 1971), “a distinctrenewal of sorcery and Satanism is occurring among Frenchmen”. And inWest Germany, traditional land of witches, spells, and hexes, upwards ofsome 10,000 people are actively engaged in this neocultism.Some Devil-worship groups have even incorporated themselves intoregular, full-fledged churches boasting memberships ranging into thethousands. Of course most people become acquainted with Devil-worshipthrough sensational newspaper accounts detailing grisly, cult-relatedslayings - some involving such macabre atrocities as cannibalism andhuman sacrifice.Isn’t it time we found out why this phenomenon continues to exist inour modern world? Is it because a literal Devil has returned under the guiseof the cults which bear his name? First, understand what Satanism is - andwhat the general beliefs of its followers are.The Plain Truth recently sent several staff correspondents to interviewAnton Szandor LaVey, founder of the San Francisco-based Church of Satan.LaVey’s organization is perhaps the best-known Devil-worship group,claiming a worldwide membership of well over 20,000. Its teachings reflectthe beliefs of many other Satanists. Here are its most significant teachings:No literal Devil: Contrary to what one might expect, most Devil-worshippers don’t believe in a literal Devil - that is, in a Devil as opposed toa Creator God. Instead they feel that the conventional Satan and the God oforganized Christianity are actually one and the same being. They feelobligated, therefore, to worship this being, since he, as they see it, is bothcreator and ruler of society. “He is the lord of this world,” says AntonLaVey, “so we might as well recognize him and give him his due.”No afterlife: Most Satanists tend to discount the idea of any afterlife.They show particular contempt for such theological teachings as Heaven,Hell, and other concepts pertaining to reward or punishment for conduct inthis life. As Anton LaVey explained, “We emphasize the ‘here and now’ - notthe unreal, intangible hereafter.”Spurn organized religion: “Christianity,” says Anton LaVey, “isnothing more than a diabolical plot which was designed to keep mankind- 1214 -entrapped for several thousand years until a better mousetrap could beinvented.” His words mirror the way most Devil-worshippers view thereligious establishment. Most Satanist cult traditions and rites mock thedogmas of conventional theology. Members of the Church of Satan, forexample, are admonished to learn and indulge in the “seven deadly sins ofChristianity” - namely lust, greed, gluttony, envy, jealousy, pride, andslothfulness. They are also urged to read and study LaVey’s self-createdSatanic Bible, which is a sort of upside-down satire of the Gospels,containing such passages as: “If a man smite you on one cheek, smash himon the other!” Church of Satan leaders also poke fun at the conventional“Satan image” during cult rituals, when they dress up in red and black garb,complete with horns, tail, and pitchfork.Do your own thing: The philosophy of gratifying the physical sensesthrough whatever means is a major part of most Satanist groups. Cultmembers regularly indulge in illicit sex, drug usage, and other forms ofpermissive behavior as a normal part of cult-related activity. Of coursethere are a few twisted individuals who “do their own thing” by committingheinous criminal atrocities under the guise of Devil-worship. It is these fewwho usually receive sensational coverage in the mass media when their actsof horror are finally uncovered. But the majority of Satanists appear asnormal people who want nothing to do with these few psychotic murderers.But again we ask: Why does such a bizarre phenomenon as Devil-worship continue to thrive in our 20th-century world? Actually Devil-worship exists today because of its appeal to a certain fringe segment of thepopulation. It satisfies two basic desires for this minority.The first is the opportunity for thrills and excitement. Thepermissiveness of Devil-worship offers its members the chance to have agood time. For some the lure is sex. For others it is drugs. Then there arethose who are just looking for the chance to indulge in something uniqueand bizarre. The opportunity to poke fun at established religion has aspecial appeal also. Many have grown up in the churches of organizedChristianity and are personally acquainted with how disillusioning andunrelated traditional religion has become. Many take great pleasure,therefore, in ridiculing the hypocrisy and stiffness of conventional theology.The second desire is the need for some form of religion. Man’s need forreligion is as basic to his nature as his desire for food and water. Peopleneed to believe in something - and to join with others who believe inessentially the same thing. Satanism offers its members the opportunity to“do their own thing” under the guise of religion. “Devil-worship is a- 1215 -religion,” contends Anton LaVey. “It’s just that our name isunconventional.” Of course, since most Devil-worshippers don’t believe inan afterlife, they generally don’t take their cult’s confused “theological”concepts too seriously …- 1216 -- 1217 -Appendix 102: “Are Neo-Satanists the Devil’s Disciples?”- by Rodney AdamsOccult Magazine #V-1, April 1974There can be little doubt that the most notorious and controversialoccult sect in the United States today is the Church of Satan, under theleadership of its first High Priest, Anton Szandor LaVey. The neo-Satanismcreated and dispensed by LaVey and his disciples has become a curse to theleaders and adherents of every other occult and metaphysical group -particularly those cults that emphasize and encourage a spiritual experienceand belief in a benevolent god-force. It would be very difficult indeed to pryeven one uncritical statement about Satanism from LaVey’s occultcontemporaries. Most people are repelled by the very word “Satanism”because it offers nothing but negative connotations in our Judæo-Christiantradition. Its place in our vocabulary is reserved for descriptions of evil,murder, orgies, and any diabolical deeds of horror and degradation.Recently a vast survey was undertaken by a group interested in theoccult in order to attempt to discover just what is behind the Satanistmovement. The group questioned numerous authorities on this subject andalso engaged in rather extensive historical and literary research in hopes oflearning anything and everything they could about Satanism. Their studyeventually led them to the Church of Satan itself and Anton LaVey, wherethey ultimately conceded that the High Priest has done everything in hispower to alienate every occult, spiritual, metaphysical, religious, andphilosophical school of thought now in existence …Research done on Anton LaVey revealed that he had established theChurch of Satan in San Francisco in 1966 and proclaimed himself HighPriest. The introduction of the Church of Satan to the world was highlightedby the now-notorious Satanic wedding ceremony. The press coverage wasworldwide. The outburst of righteous indignation that followed was alsoworldwide. In the seven years that followed, LaVey and his church haveconstantly been in the news - usually at the national level. The High Priest’spronouncements have consistently outraged his opponents. Indeed theyseem to have been purposely composed to instigate violent reactions fromthose who follow not only the orthodox path, but the many diverse schoolsof occult belief as well. Many felt it was bad enough to read of LaVey’scomments and statements in the press, but then LaVey’s Satanic Bible wasreleased in 1969. The uproar over this textbook promoting the philosophyof Satanism, the practice of partially-pirated magic rituals, and the- 1218 -indulgences of so-called “rational self-interest” infuriated thousands ofdevout metaphysicians and witches around the world. No sooner did thefuror abate than LaVey published The Compleat Witch. If there were anypractitioners of the Old Religion left who had remained neutral overLaVey’s Satanism before this book came out, they were surely recruited tothe anti-LaVey movement. And now the Satanic Rituals is on thebookshelves. Contained in this volume is the most fiendish blasphemy ofall, the Black Mass, laid out for the world to see. The total effect of thislatest issue of Satanic literature is difficult to measure. Many feel this couldhave a detrimental effect on the much-heralded Age of Aquarius, with itspromise of peace and brotherhood. Sincere followers of the doctrines oflight and spiritual awareness have been appalled by the emphasis on BlackMagic, witchcraft, and Satanism. These metaphysicians apparently feel thatthese subjects constitute an unholy triumvirate and are the antithesis oftheir own beliefs - all of which serves to confirm the witches’ fear that theyare being unfairly lumped together with the Satanists.John M. Kincaid, the Minister of Information for the Church of Satan,gives this data about his organization: The Church of Satan now has overtwo million avowed disciples, as indicated by the sale of literature and othergoods. Circulation of the Cloven Hoof, the Church newsletter, is 20,000and is now being offered to nonmembers for the first time. Adherence toSatanism as expounded by the Church of Satan is heaviest in the U.S., Italy,Germany, Holland, Brazil, Argentina, and Spain. Australia and someAfrican countries are coming up fast. There is representation in virtuallyevery country of the world, including the Soviet Union. A Satanic Grotto isactive in almost every major city in the country. By 1975 Satanists expect tohave attained popular favor, even in Bible Belt areas. By 1984 Satanism’sovert influence will be readily observable in our social and governmentalclimate. By the turn of the century, Satanism will be the major religion ofthe Western world and, by another name, also that of the Eastern. MostSatanists are in the 18-30 age bracket. Executive positions are held by thosein the over-40 age group. There is a woman for every man in themembership. Three out of four Satanists renew their membership eachyear. Most members have given considerable thought to joining the Churchand remain stable in their enthusiasm and participation. There are 113official Agents of the Church of Satan engaged [on a regional basis] in theeffort of organizing and serving the world’s Satanic Grottos.Lest someone think that the Cloven Hoof, the Church’s officialnewsletter, is nothing more than a collection of exhortations to the faithful,- 1219 -encouraging them to go out in the world and perpetrate horrible deedsagainst their enemies and detractors, this much should at least be noted:There is nothing at all damning in the Cloven Hoof. The publication is abright, intellectual digest filled with intriguing articles and some novelpoints of view, for the most part compatible with much the seriousoccultist, psychologist, and student already accepts. While one shouldcertainly be reluctant to praise Satan and his church, the Satanists must begiven this much. Their publication reveals that they are embarked on theirown peculiar search for truth and are just as busy restructuring reality totheir own taste as are the rest of us. There is much valid material tostimulate the imagination in the Cloven Hoof. 880In an article called “The Source”, one writer asks whether AleisterCrowley should be endorsed as a Satanic Master or rejected as an irrationalfanatic. The writer raises the proposition that Crowley ended upinadvertently bolstering the foundations of Christianity by erroneouslypinning his doctrines on a false understanding of ancient Egypt. The readeris taken through a carefully developed thesis in support of this heretoforeoutrageous contention, until he ends up with serious misgivings about hisoriginal understanding of Crowley, ancient Egypt, and the real history ofthis cradle of modern knowledge and religion.Some other articles are equally provocative and include: “Those WhoSeek Shall Find” (a study of the Enochian Keys), “The Secrets of Life andDeath” (an examination of the scientific understanding of immortality), and“Genesis II” (an analysis of the physical nature of the Universe and somehypothetical form of energy). As one would expect, High Priest AntonLaVey has a message for his followers in each issue. Some of thesemessages concern music for the ritual chamber, something called “eroticcrystallization inertia (ECI)” (which deals with the pleasures received viavisual stimulation and why we retain old favorites), “Ravings fromTartarus” (which features LaVey’s explanations for the failure of rituals forcertain practitioners), and finally an essay on “The Importance of BeingEvil”.It is not surprising to note that even the Satanists have conventions. Arecent one was held in the same hotel being used by the World Council ofChurches. It was noted with amusement that a delegation of two Satanistswas dispatched to allay Christian fears caused by the possible echo ofnameless rites and unspeakable orgies from afar. While the Satanists were880 Purr, purr!- 1220 -received with deference, the diplomacy was not reciprocated, althoughassurances were given that a holy deputation from the Council of Churcheswould not be destined for sacrifice on a Satanic altar.One article seemed somehow out of place in the Cloven Hoof. It wastitled “Spiritual Satanism” by Stephen Hollander of Canada. Mr. Hollanderwrites: “Can a Satanist experience great spiritual enlightenment orawakening in the context of Satanism? This is a question which isfrequently put to articulate Satanists by perceptive people who aregenuinely interested in learning about Satanism. The answer is that suchspiritual growth is indeed possible, although whether it is in fact spiritual inthe classic sense is perhaps debatable.”A further investigation of Satanism revealed this explanation of theirphilosophy by L. Dale Seago of Havelock, North Carolina: “The firstmisconception about the Church of Satan is that it consists of Devil-worshippers. Members of the Church do not believe in either the Devil orGod in the Judæo-Christian sense, but regard man as the supreme being.Likewise they regard such things as palmistry, mysticism, spiritualism,astrology, and Tarot cards as superstitious nonsense. Paradoxical though itmay seem, they do believe in the power and effects of ritual magic.”In answer to the criticism that Satanism promotes a brand ofpermissiveness which is inconsistent with promoting individualresponsibility for the improvement of the individual or his fellow man,Seago replied: “Quite the contrary. By denying the existence of anysupernatural entity and by presenting man as the arbiter of his own destiny,Satanism places moral responsibility where it belongs - squarely upon theshoulders of the individual. It does not deny a person satisfaction of hishuman needs, but it does insist that he recognize that he and he alone isresponsible for his actions and their consequences. For many people this istoo great a burden to bear, and they find it much easier to subscribe to asystem which will order their lives and tell them what to do rather than tomake their own decisions. But then Satanists, unlike followers of mostreligions, make no claim that their religion is for everyone.”Whenever Satanism is discussed, the question of secret, evil, andcriminal practices comes up. Throughout history Devil-worship, thepractice of Black Magic, paganism, and Satanism have been accompaniedby acts of blood sacrifice, perverted sexual excesses, kidnapping, rape, andmurder. There can be little doubt that these things have happened, as thedeeds have been well documented. Therefore it is appropriate to raise thequestion: Are these practices part of organized Satanism today? Every one- 1221 -of the Satanists contacted denied any involvement with any activity of acriminal nature. In fact they joined in the universal condemnation ofbrutality, vandalism, and lawbreaking. Anton LaVey said, “Anything thathurts a person who doesn’t deserve to be hurt is evil. Vandalism is a terriblething. The ripping of a fine painting in a museum, or the toppling over ofpotted plants in front of apartment houses, is very wrong.”When asked whether he believed in a personification of an evil forceindependent and totally apart from what the Christian would identify as thework of Satan, LaVey replied, “Yes. It is not a force, really, but a humanbehavioral factor - certainly not animal behavior, because man is thelowest, not the highest animal. This human behavioral factor isindependent of Satanic motivation. It is the byproduct of a person’s owninheritance, environment, mental imbalance, lack of ability to cope with theworld, and inability to relate to others, or an over inflated ego.” Mr. LaVeyalso informed us that the Church of Satan very carefully screensapplications for membership. We were told that only one out of fiveapplicants is successful in obtaining membership. One purpose of thisscreening process is to prevent “misfits”, “sickies”, and “weirdoes” fromjoining the Church proper. The Church of Satan takes no responsibility forthe individual acts of its members.It is much too early to determine just where the enigmatic Church ofSatan is going to fit into the new occult galaxy. It appears certain, whetherwe like it or not, that Anton LaVey’s organization is here to stay. Neithercan it be denied that Satanists are a force to be reckoned with. The Churchof Satan is well-organized and has thousands of dedicated followers, manyof whom are talented and successful men and women. They have formed alegal corporate entity, they have active field representatives, they gather atconventions, they publish an international newsletter, and they apologize tono one for their existence. While we must acknowledge the very realexistence of organized Satanism in America today, we are certainly notobligated to applaud its rise to new heights of power. This neo-Satanismmay be more respectable than its predecessors, but it is no less risky. Thepremature approach to ritual magic and exposure to group psychodrama bythe ill-prepared may constitute a great threat to mental health …Most authorities in the occult and metaphysical world agree that thereis a negative force at work in our Universe, and that this force is nothingwith which to tamper, particularly by the uninitiated. While they are not inagreement as to what the real nature of this negative force is, they allexpress a real concern for the safety of those who challenge its power. The- 1222 -Christian believes the penalty for consorting with the Devil is Hell andeternal damnation. The metaphysician believes that Satanists will becomeinsane, will be marooned in the murky never-never land of the lower astralplanes, or will build a terrible Karmic pattern for themselves. There arevery few in the area of traditional metaphysics who have anything good tosay about Satanism. Most believe that nothing good can come from it.LaVey and his Church of Satan have dared to challenge the veryfoundations of occult philosophy and belief. Just as he has challenged theorthodox faiths by accusing them of worshipping a false god and offollowing superstition and myth, he has attacked the occult with the sameweapons.Today’s neo-Satanists are saying, “We declare there is no supremebeing; we ridicule your deity with impunity. To Hell with God! May he dohis worst. Man is god and god is man; we worship man the magnificentanimal. Rational self-interest is our creed. We live now and make the mostof it, because the afterlife is a myth. Magic is power, the only power, and itis neutral. There is nothing to fear from magic. There is no Black Magic, noWhite Magic - only magic.”One conclusion is inescapable: The neo-Satanists are spitting in the eyeof conventional religion and philosophy. They have stood forth andchallenged the deities themselves - those positive forces of spiritual powerand the guardians of our promised reward of a life after death. They haveinvited the very wrath of God.- 1223 -Appendix 103: “Psi in the Sky”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #VI-2, March/April IX/1974The human race is nothing if not predictable. For a decade or sofollowing World War II, it was fashionable to be a materialist. Then anexistentialist. Then a hedonist. Then an anarchist. Then an occultist. Andnow a parapsychologist. From the looks of things, the masses are botchingthis one too.Lately the news media have become increasingly preoccupied with so-called “psychic phenomena” and parapsychology ( Psi). The situation ispretty well summed up in Time magazine’s cover story, “The Psychics”, forthe 3/4/74 issue. In utmost seriousness this article cites the “psychic”accomplishments of as transparent an assortment of innocents [and frauds]as we’ve seen anywhere. We’re not going to waste time discussing thevarious antics, as there are plenty of ESP pulps around for you to sample onyour own. Instead we’re going to give you some hard and fast data on thesubject. As Satanists you may turn this new fad to your personal advantage.Why Psi? Very simple. It is, to borrow another Time phrase, asubstitute faith. It is a blurring of material science and occult mysticism.For those who haven’t the intellectual strength to pursue Satanism itself,Psi becomes an egotistical refuge. The Satanist says, “I am a god.” Theparapsychologist says, “It looks as though God may exist after all, since Ihave managed to find phenomena which do not fit in with materialisticnature as I have known it.” He nods smug agreement to Sir James Jeans’oft-quoted statement that “the Universe begins to look more and more likea great thought than a great machine”. And the Satanist replies, “Wouldn’tit be more accurate to simply characterize the machine as being morecomplex than we once supposed?”It is significant that the Psi boom has been most pronounced in theSoviet Union. Note that traditional religion is strictly suppressed by thegovernment, and that there is no form of institutional Satanism that is opento the general populace. Yet the masses need a mystical panacea; hence Psi.Elsewhere the boom feeds on simple disillusionment [an appropriate term]with the impersonality of a strictly material Universe. Where man hasn’tthe courage to create his gods consciously, he will do so unconsciously.For the record: It is probable that many automatic physiologicalfunctions [such as pulse-rate and temperature] may be influenced by thewill, particularly with the aid of biological monitoring devices. There is- 1224 -nothing supernatural about this. Acupuncture is an infant science, butagain it is no more unscientific than, say, hypnotism. The same holds truewith Kirlian photography; it has been established for a long time that livingorganisms emit infrared/heat radiation. As the level of our adrenalinevaries with our emotional state, is it not logical to assume that our naturalradiation would also? So why all the fuss? Kirlian “ghost-images” ofbisected leaves, etc. may be fraudulent [double-exposure photography,etc.], or the phenomenon may result from continued emission of radiationfrom the parent organism in the direction of the amputated unit. Here alsowe must await further experimental data.Precognition is 100% illogical. If there is such a thing as free will - andthe Satanist acts upon this proposition - then individuals do not move inpredetermined paths. Good guesses based upon psychological probabilitiesare, on the other hand, quite possible. Indeed the magician makessophisticated use of this principle in manipulating persons and events forhis own ends.Clairvoyance (i.e. perception of inanimate events at a distance) is notnecessarily impossible. It is highly improbable, for the reason that mentalreception presumably requires mental transmission in some way, shape, orform. And now what about mind-to-mind telepathy?In its 6/4/VI issue the Nineveh Grotto Blacklist carried a report oncurrent experiments in Electronic Stimulation of the Brain (ESB). Throughthe insertion of fine electronic probes into the brain, immediate changes indisposition, behavior, sensations, and thought-processes can be broughtabout. In one rather amusing experiment, an ESB-rigged bull stopped in itstracks a few feet away from a matador - having suddenly “lost interest” inhim! In another experiment a human subject tore a magazine to shredsunder ESB stimulus, in spite of his strenuous efforts to control his motions.We bring up ESB here because, among other things, it demonstratesthat human mental processes are electronic in nature. Your thoughts, yourmemory, and your will are organized and realized through an astoundinglycomplex electronic “computer” between your ears. Thus it follows that anyform of telepathy would have to be electronic as well.And here is the rub: Not only is the brain practically 100% insulatedagainst outside electrical discharge [else you would get a headache in thevicinity of an electrical generation device], but the atmosphere on thisplanet is a nonconductor as well. Furthermore the electric impulsesgenerated by the human brain are so weak that the prospect of their“jumping” from one head to another is about as probable as a human being- 1225 -standing on Earth and suddenly jumping to Mars. Electrical telepathy ispossible, but only with the aid of artificial amplification devices [andpresuming that the electrical circuits within the brain can eventually bemapped]. First-stage amplification devices are already being used to accordamputees mental control over battery-driven artificial limbs.And telepathic influence over inanimate objects, such as Israelinightclub magician Uri Geller claims to possess? Again a practicalimpossibility, for the simple reason that the brain cannot generate suchcomparatively vast concentrations of energy.The brain is a machine that, through long ages of evolution, has beenrefined towards one end - thought. Through thought it can direct thematerial/motor activities of the body towards the attainment of desiredgoals. As the High Priest points out on page #121 of the Satanic Bible,trying to levitate a teacup or roll a pencil off a table via mind-power alone isridiculous. To draw an analogy: If you have two perfectly good legs, does itmake much sense to practice dragging yourself down the street by yourfingers until you can do this better than anyone else on the block?Instead of wasting time trying to make his brain do work that machines- invented by the brain - can do so much better, the Satanist directs hisattention towards improving those machines. We have built radiotelescopes that can probe practically to the end of the known Universe. Weshould now fritter away our time trying to make our unamplified thoughtstravel six feet?Satanic magic involves the achievement of desired ends by the mostefficient means available. ESP is so inefficient that not a single scientifictest has conclusively proven even its mere existence! And there is no area ofESP “activity” that is not overwhelmingly more accessible through non-ESPmeans. Q.E.D.- 1226 -- 1227 -Appendix 104: “A Black Mass for the Masses?”- by R. Jzamon DeCecco II°Straight From Hell #II-2, March/April IX/1974It behooves me, at this time, to present a subject that seems indigenousto the stature of Satanic development. It is the familiar question: WillSatanism grow into a religion for the masses? [By “the masses” I assumethat people think of a religion with millions of followers, such asCatholicism, Protestantism, etc.]I have had several discussions with members and nonmembers on thismatter. Outsiders seem to believe that Satanism is just a passing fad,growing rapidly because of social unrest mingled with deprivation anddissatisfaction with standard Judæo/Christian tenets. On the other hand,members feel that the Satanic movement is emblematic of the survivaltheory, inasmuch as Satanism will attract only the strong and intelligent.I tend to agree with the latter, with the exception that among thepeople who join our Church, many thousands will ultimately fall offthrough apathy, lack of adventure and esoteric involvement in what theyexpect in sexual or perverse ideals, or just plain incompatibility.Dr. LaVey, in his interview with Brad Steiger in The Devil is Alive andWell and Living in America Today, says, “We believe that Satanism isgoing to be the major religion of the Eastern world, by a different name.”He does state, however, that “it takes more than belief to become a memberof the Church of Satan proper, which is not to be confused with Satanism asa movement”. This helps me make my point: Thousands, maybe millions ofpeople are already Satanically oriented. Out of these numbers will emergemany who will join the Church of Satan for status, which I suppose is allwell and good for us if they pass the screening process. Others will practiceSatanism secretly, including the practice of Satanic magic.Great numbers will continue to practice Satanism only in the affairs oftheir everyday lives, bringing their droll existence up a notch but notoutwardly admitting their Left-Hand Path orientation for fear ofpersecution.A select number - and these are the few who will sustain the Church ofSatan as a powerful force in the world - who will meet the standards, willmaster the magic and will be the brainwork and backbone of the Church:the elect few who have the power and the intellect to influence the millionsI have earlier exemplified.- 1228 -However this development comes about, it will be a dual growth: thosewho are practicing Satanists and those who are idealistic Satanists. Ineither case it works for the betterment of mankind. En masse or not, theChurch of Satan will survive.Ask any wishy-washy Christian three questions about his creed, andyou’ll probably receive a jumbled mishmash of gibberish. Ask anyone whohas read the Satanic Bible three questions concerning its precepts, and I’msure you’ll get three clear answers. Another credit to Satanism: It’s basicallyeasy to understand - mostly because Satanism is a natural religion.Christians are so bogged down in Latin, hypocrisy, and fuzzy dogma thatonly the initiated are able to understand - if indeed they do.So the question remains: Will Satanism become a religion for themasses? Yes and no. Yes for the masses who are strong, intelligent, andpowerful. No for the masses who’d want to join just because it’s the thing todo - a thought that spawns nausea. I cannot help but be disgruntled by theidea of Christians joining Satan just to be assured of their place in Hell!- 1229 -Appendix 105: Walpurgisnacht Feast of Life- by Robert Ethel III°Voice of the Dragon #I-2, March IX/1974I.The second assistant enters the chamber, lights the candles uponthe altar, and stands to the right.

Newsletter #II-2, Typhon Grotto, April IX/1974Recently I was on a radio talk show in Cleveland, Ohio with two othermembers of the Church of Satan. We spent nearly five hours discussing theChurch of Satan, its philosophies, and our personal opinions on Satanism,only to be interrupted every few minutes by phone callers yellingobscenities, quoting Bible passages, and damning us to Hell [flatteringthough it might be]. Overall the evening was a success, if only to the extentof making the public aware of the Church of Satan. There was littlecommunication or understanding on the other end of the phone lines,however.This is the year IX of the reign of Satan. There is a general awareness inmost cities of the country of Satanism and the Church of Satan. Is simplyhearing the philosophies of the C/S enough? The masses of brainwashedChristians quoting passages from the Bible [it’s “in”], following theirreligious beliefs without knowing why, believing simply because “it’swritten” - need only question themselves and their beliefs.Recently I was confronted by a Jesus freak at work. Rather than explainand defend my beliefs, as I had done in previous discussions with others inthe same group who had closed their minds to outside thoughts and whowere unable to question themselves and their beliefs, I took a differentapproach.I began in this manner: Asking the Jesus freak to hold his commentsuntil I had finished, I said, “I am a Satanist and proud of it! But mostimportantly I know why I am a Satanist. You are a Christian. You believe inthe Lord God Almighty. Why? And don’t tell me ‘the Bible tells me to’,because that’s no answer. I indulge in the ‘Seven Deadly Sins’ without guilt.They are natural instincts of man and animal and bring me emotional andphysical gratification. They are the fruits of life! After church you take thefamily out for a Sunday dinner, committing the sin of gluttony. Do you feelguilty for having sinned so hastily, or do you enjoy yourself? You cannothate. You cannot kill. Yet you believe in a Christian God who has causedmore wars and more death to man than any other single force! Are youproud? Do you not enjoy sex? Do you not enjoy sleeping late on Saturdays?“The Christian church uses the Seven Deadly Sins merely as aninsurance policy. It covers all forms of enjoyment [perhaps ‘streaking’- 1234 -wasn’t foretold], knowing that man’s instinctive nature cannot abstain fromsuch forms of enjoyment. So it labels them sins. By your faith in the Bible,you will return humbly each Sunday, with your contributions to the ‘funds’,to be forgiven of your sins. Is this not so?“And you will continue to live crawling on the ground like an infantchild! You will continue to suffer the guilt of sinning, because this is howyou serve your God. Can you not see that you are being used? You are justanother fool who has allowed himself to be infected with this Christiancancer - a cancer which is always spreading, as there is a great supply ofunquestioning, gullible fools such as yourself, willing to waste their lives,never knowing the true enjoyment of life.“You say you are promised true enjoyment of life - after death. You cansit on Cloud #9 for the rest of eternity and strum harps for angels to danceto! What fun! Can you really believe in such a fairy tale as this? ‘The Bibletells me.’ ‘The Bible promises.’ Surely you cannot be foolish enough tothrow away your entire life for a book of false promises. You know surely ofthe life here on Earth, and of the pleasures and enjoyments it has to offer ifonly you indulge. You needn’t be deceived any longer. Life is here and now,as you are. Death will come soon enough. You are the highest level of life onthis Earth. You are a man. You have a brain which can think on its own. Youcan make your own decisions, decide your own morals. You are your owngod! Don’t give someone else the pleasure of living your life for you. Don’tallow yourself to die before you’ve been born. Question your beliefs. If youcan accept the answers of a dead book by faith, the you are truly a man! Iam proud to be a Satanist. I know why I am. I am living!”At this point I was able to communicate a short history of the Church ofSatan, and some of the philosophies in the Satanic Bible. [No Bible-quotesfollowed! Hooray!]I may not have sold this particular person on Satanism, but he isassuredly thinking and questioning his beliefs. Christians and Jesus freakshave stagnant minds. They need only to be reintroduced to the ability toquestion. [Some are more stubborn than others.] They must be able to wipeout the nonsense which they have allowed to control their minds.This approach would be most effective on talk or TV shows: making theaudience question themselves before they question you. Once they questionthemselves, they become open-minded enough to hear the philosophies ofthe Satanic Bible.- 1235 -Appendix 107: “The Ægis Kick-Off Dinner”- by Anne Allee I°Straight From Hell #II-2, May/June IX/1974On Saturday, March 16th we had our first dinner to start off the newGrotto here in Massachusetts. We intended to discuss plans and ideas forthe future of Satanism in this area, because for a long time we had been at astandstill.Well, one brave man finally decided to do something about it, and thisarticle could be something of a tribute to him. I speak of Robert DeCecco,who went out of his way to plan reservations for a dinner, and to drive longdistances so that he could start Satanism on the road to success here in NewEngland.I would also like to mention here Warlock Reynard (John Renaud), avery ambitious, dedicated man who traveled over a hundred miles in theinterests of Satanism.We went to the Holiday Inn, South Attleboro and had cocktails in thelounge. We then went on to a very nice table in the rear of the dining roomso we could have privacy. Due to unfortunate circumstances we did nothave as large a turnout as we’d hoped for. Even though the attendance wasnot impressive, we did not let ourselves get discouraged, because we believegreat and prosperous things are going to happen concerning our plannedfuture Grotto and concerning Satanism in New England.We left there at 9:30, as the dining room was closing, and drove inwhat could only be described as hurricane conditions all the way back to mytown of Brookline. Since it was still early, we went to a local restaurant for alast drink before saying our goodnights.Well, “irony” is the only word for what happened then. There we were -Satanists in the middle of a St. Patrick’s Day party, complete with the usualChristian hypocrites - drunk and working to have fun on a “religious”holiday! By this time we were laughing too hard to care about theunimpressive attendance at our kickoff dinner. That’s when I realized that ifall this can’t get us down, nothing can. With a spirit like ours, we willlaunch Satanism to greatness here in New England.You see, we have a far greater challenge here in spreading our greatcause than in any other part of the country, because this is such a closed-minded, puritanical location.Come on, active members, let’s work towards this common goaltogether! We can do it only through active participation and support! We- 1236 -have strength in numbers. Let’s all do our part to make this among the bestand most significant Grottos there ever were! Rege Satanas!- 1237 -Appendix 108: “Suicide: Indulgence or Compulsion?”- by R. Jzamon DeCecco II°Straight From Hell #II-5, September/October IX/1974Prologue: It is not my intention in this short statement to present allaspects of this controversial subject. There remain many related areas,absent from this study, that will be covered in future attempts. I offer thefollowing as an amateur opinion only, void of the training and experienceneeded in this area. One could call this a catalyst to spur thinking anddebate. I cite the following for reasons obvious to this work:From the Satanic Bible:[Page #81:] A compulsion is never created by indulging, but by not beingable to indulge.[Page #81:] … Indulgence implies choice, whereas compulsion indicatesthe lack of choice.[Page #94:] Self-sacrifice is not encouraged by the Satanic religion.Therefore, unless death comes as an indulgence because of extremecircumstances which make the termination of life a welcome relief from anunendurable Earthly existence, suicide is frowned upon by the Satanicreligion.From the New Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary:Suicide: the act of killing oneself purposely.Indulge: to give free rein to; to take unrestrained pleasure in.Compulsion: coercion; an irresistible impulse.There exist, at least in this observer’s experience, questions as towhether suicide can realistically be occasionally classified as an indulgence.Query: If compulsion is indeed “an irresistible impulse”, then it mustbe considered that indulgence is nonresistance to, or the act of succumbingto impulses without the existence of choice (which the term “irresistible”implies). This confusing allegory brings about another question. Is notsuicide a compulsive action taken when all roads of free experience anddesires (indulgences) have been cut off (choice)? The taking of one’s ownlife, therefore, cannot be an “irresistible impulse”, for the term implieschoice. The familiar phrase “driven to suicide” is indicative of this forcedimpulse that leaves the unfortunate self-murderer no choice. Afterattempting in every possible way to solve the problem that leads to this end,- 1238 -the subject is forcibly driven to an end which was, in the subject’s sense,unavoidable - connotating a compulsive solution.I can agree with the Satanic Bible’s assertion that suicide may becomean indulgence if life becomes unbearable, but with certain reservations. Iwill make three hypotheses that we may consider:1. Suicide may be termed an indulgence under circumstances of direphysical suffering, so acute that the person, in a state of nearly unconsciouspain, compulsively murders the illness and therefore dies.2. The unreasonably extreme sadomasochist: [I must point out herethat I refer only to the person who inflicts wounds and unusually severepunishment upon himself - the psychopathic self-impaler.] This personculminates his self-torture whilst in a state of psychosis, with what he mightcall - could he speak after his suicide to give an opinion - accidental death.In this sense, therefore, he indulges himself in his extreme pleasures,unconcerned with the results.3. I am reminded of instances we often read about where peoplecommit suicide allegedly because of blindness, loss of limbs, addiction todrugs, etc. Are these some possible reasons for suicide as an indulgence? Orare these cases compulsively “driven” to that end … to be free of theircursed suffering! Suffering not necessarily unbearably painful, but by theirstandards impossible to live with. In the case of the suicidal drug addict, wemay in some cases draw a parallel between the sadomasochist discussedearlier and the addict who unknowingly commits self-inflicted death as anindulgence in his or her pleasure.Top Billing: Let us now turn to the example of personages of fortuneand notoriety, such as Hollywood stars and starlets who have committedsuicide. It seems to me, outwardly, that these people had much to live for.They had wealth, beauty, fame; and they usually indulged in a full life. Idoubt that their cases could be termed suicide by indulgence, although wewill never know the real reason for their act. In my opinion they were“driven” to their deaths, more than likely, by one of many circumstances:blackmail, alcoholism, career pressure, divorce, and any number ofmaterial, physical, or emotional catalysts. If the above is correct, a lack ofchoice seems the reasonable disposition in these instances. At least itseemed reasonably apparent to them.Two Outcasts: Famed psychiatrist Thomas Szasz writes, “Althoughsuicide is a grave sin for Roman Catholics, many persons accused ofwitchcraft killed themselves in prison to escape torture.” In the same workhe quotes Karl Menninger as writing, “It has been observed that suicidal- 1239 -attempts sometimes follow the interruption of an individual’s habitualautoerotic activities (masturbation). This interruption may come in theform of a prohibition from external forces or from the person’s ownconscience. In either case the mechanisms by which the suicide isprecipitated are the same; the masturbation occasions a heavy burden ofguilt because, in the unconscious mind, it always represents an aggressionagainst someone.” In the above cases it seems to me that the suicide, orattempts, are a product of compulsion: guilt as the catalyst for themasturbator, and fear as that for the accused witches.7 and 11: Ounces and Games: Most of us are familiar with the phrases“compulsive gambler” and “compulsive drinker”. Basically they both maybe dealt with in the same manner, as they each infer overindulgence. Onlythe rudiments of the impulse differ, i.e. liquor as opposed to money orchance bets. Both of these so-called compulsions, I feel, are reallyindulgences. My reasoning is based upon the premise that each issupposedly pleasurable. Gambling is the practice of betting money onvarious games of chance in order to win - games, in this case. Money andbetting are, were you to ask a gambler’s opinion, fun. Drinking is the intakeof alcoholic beverages at parties, nightclubs, when alone, etc. Theconsumption of liquor results, ultimately, in feelings of lightheadednessand occasionally those of sensuality and fun. [The next morning is anotherstory.]So we will assume that pleasure is derived in one way or another fromgambling and drinking. To get to the point: Only when the indulgence ofgaming and drinking becomes harmful or destructive to the subject or hisenvironment (loved ones, job, etc.) does the practice becomeoverindulgence. It cannot be compulsive, because the imbiber or gamblerhas a choice: He can stop drinking or wasting money, with or withoutpsychiatric help. There is no way for the suicidally-inclined to obtain help tostop living! The doomed person, therefore, is not overindulging in life; he iscompulsively ending his living!Here’s That Rainy Day: Depression, a common occurrence amongpeople, leads in some cases to such a severe state of helplessness thatsuicide ensues. A depression as severe as this, although classed by somepsychiatrists as a mental disorder, usually begins as just plain sadness. Oneproblem (the initial cause of the sadness) leads to another; and during thisprocess the depressed person becomes more and more fatalistic in thesense that all he seems to experience or to try to understand doesn’t workout. Or he feels he is fated to fail, and so he makes no attempt to reconcile- 1240 -the problems. Hence he goes deeper and deeper into himself. Ultimately, Ifeel, he is compelled to end his suffering and woes by murdering hisfailures, troubles, persecutory relationships or any of many scapegoats,therefore dying.A Final Meal? Another form of suicide is the example of the personwho, allegedly, intentionally commits the act. I say “allegedly” because Icannot accept the premise that, for example, the obese person is “eatinghimself to death” (consciously or unconsciously), as stated by psychiatristLeo Madow (Anger). If a person is reminded by his doctor that he will die ifhe doesn’t stop eating so heavily, I’m sure the patient will make an attemptto slow down or diet, and not intentionally eat himself to suicide - especiallyif he is obese and uncomfortably ill.The same can be said of the exceedingly reckless person [save for thestunt driver, whose apparent love affair with possible harm or death fallsinto other categories, i.e. inferiority complex, sexual gratification, etc.].Despite his recklessness he does take certain precautions to avoid mishapsthat could deprive him of his indulgence in danger and daring. This person,who is made aware of possible harm by overindulging, is not the personwho commits suicide. It is the person who is made aware, by distortedreasoning arrived at under severe pressure, that by destroying the cause orroot of his problem he will be free. The fact that he will go with the problemseems, at that point, unimportant.Epilogue: In the preceding viewpoint I offer merely the possiblecontention that suicidal endings to human lives lean to the compulsiveoption of death over that of continued existence, in other words amurdering of the cause and not of the individual.Issue for Future Study: According to D.J. West, one of every threemurders committed in the United States is followed by the suicide of themurderer.Bibliography:LaVey, Anton Szandor, The Satanic Bible.Madow, Leo, Anger.Menninger, Karl, Man Against Himself.Szasz, Thomas, The Manufacture of Madness.West, D.J., Murder Followed by Suicide.- 1241 -Appendix 109: “Aradia’s Cauldron”- by “Aradia”Berks County Record, Reading, Pennsylvania, ca. August 22, 1974Greetings to all you witches and would-be witches. We really enjoy yourletters, and will be glad to answer any questions you may have onwitchcraft. So please let us know if there are any particular topics youwould like to see discussed here.Terry T. writes: “You claim to be a separate cult from the Satanists, yetin all the books I’ve read Satanists refer to themselves as ‘witches’! What isthe difference between what you are and the Satanists?”This is only one of many letters I have received which mentions theconfusion between the Old Religion and Satanism. In view of this I decidedto try to get an interview with a Satanist so that you could more readily seethe difference for yourself. I wrote to Anton LaVey at the Church of Satan inCalifornia, sending a typewritten sheet of questions which I thought wouldbe most pertinent for our readers. I was answered by a very nice letter andanswers to my questions from Michael A. Aquino, Magister Templi IV°,saying that he had been requested to respond on behalf of the High Priest.Here then is the interview with Michael A. Aquino, Magister Templi IV° ofthe Church of Satan:Q: I noticed that in Anton LaVey’s book The Compleat Witch, he keepsreferring to the reader as a “witch”. In your mind is witchcraft as practicedby Old Religionists and Satanism synonymous? If so, why is it so?A: The Compleat Witch is directed primarily at female readers. “Witch”is the title given to an accomplished female Satanist; it is the second degreeof membership within the Church. [The male counterpart is “Warlock”.] Wedo not consider the Wiccans to be qualified as Witches according to ourstandards. The so-called “Old Religion” is precisely that - a psychologicalregression to primitive nature-worship. Factually this is nonsense. Satanistsworship the self, using Satan as an idealized symbol of mankind raised todivine status.Q: In your opinion, can witchcraft, Satanism, and fundamentalistJudæo-Christianity peacefully coexist in our society? Or is this just the “lullbefore the storm”? Will there eventually begin again the persecutions, sothat the fundamentalists come out top dog, or will the witches destroy- 1242 -themselves with so much bickering and animosity within the Craft? Andwhere will you and your followers be in all of this?A: Satanists prey upon non-Satanists. All conventional religions aresymptomatic of a “security blanket” mentality on the part of the adherents,whether worship be directed towards Allah, Yahweh, a mother-goddess, ora ten-foot-tall red jelly bean. Whether Wicca gains or loses converts fromProtestant or Catholic groups is unimportant, since there is no essentialdistinction between them. And any wave of persecution that arises willbypass us, since we are in social positions to instigate and channel suchdevelopments, not to be opposed by them.Q: Does your Church of Satan attract a lot of young people, and if so areany of them the “hippie” element or just plain crackpots?A: We attract a good many young people, but our admission standardsare high. Approximately nine out of ten applications submitted are notapproved. If by “hippie” you really mean “bum”, such types are neveradmitted.Q: I dislike using terms like “White” witches or “Black” witches, sinceactually we’re really sort of “grey” witches, if one must use that terminology.I don’t like to specify aspects of good and evil in this way. What, in youropinion, is “good” and what is “evil”?A: “Good” is what you like and “evil” is what you don’t like. Everyonehas a different opinion, of course.Q: As you may know, witches do not believe in Heaven or Hell. Theybelieve that man gets another chance to right his wrongs in this life throughreincarnation, and that the place we all go to between Earthly lives isSummerland. As Satan-worshippers, what is your concept of an afterlife?A: When you die, your brain cells rot and your personality decomposes.You become Nothing, just as you were Nothing prior to your birth.Reincarnation and life-after-death in Summerland, Heaven, etc. areridiculous concepts. Hell, on the other hand, exists. You’re in it right now.Better enjoy it while you can.- 1243 -Q: What are your views on homosexuality in your religion? Manywitches consider this a contradiction, since witchcraft is a nature-religionand is concerned with fertility. I should say we emphasize fertility of themind rather than of the body. What are your views on homosexuality, andwould it interfere with anyone working with you magically?A: We take no official stand one way or another on individual sexualpreferences. Sex is purely a personal matter.Q: What stand do you take on drugs, in or out of the Craft, butespecially in the Craft?A: Satanists may not weaken their mental powers, physical health, ormagical ability through psychological or physiological crutches of any sort.Those who do are expelled. As for non-Satanists, they are welcome to abusethemselves as much as they care to.Q: Is it not paradoxical that you are completely open in your Church ofSatan, while witchcraft covens still remain for the most part underground?A: We have no reason to hide, since we have no enemy from whom it isworth hiding. We don’t exist on tolerance or civil rights - but rather becauseno one has the power to impede us. The Wiccans remain “closet occultists”because deep down inside they know they are acting like fools and don’twant their normal friends, business associates, etc. to laugh at them.Q: Do you have any system or “witches’ grapevine” for weeding outundesirables who might be attracted to your Church of Satan, or are allcomers welcome?A: Applicants pay an initial fee of $25 if accepted. Annual renewal is$10. Each applicant must complete a detailed psychological questionnaire.If the results of this questionnaire are unsatisfactory, the application fee isrefunded and membership is denied.Q: Is the Satan you worship in your Church of Satan the Christian Devilwith all the trappings of evil, and if so do you consider yourself evil?- 1244 -A: The real Satan is a far more complex entity than the simplisticcaricature of Judaic/Christian literature. From our point of view he is“good”, and so are we.- 1245 -Appendix 110: “Quo Vadis?”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #VI-4, July/August IX/1974Among our mail we find a significant number of comments somethinglike this: “When I joined the Church of Satan, I thought that I wasbecoming a member of a religious organization dedicated to the worship ofthe Devil. At least the Satanic Bible left me with this impression. But whilethe Cloven Hoof is all very interesting from a philosophical andmaterialistic standpoint, it seems to regard ‘devil-worship’ as little morethan a convenient allegory.Is this a church? Does Satan really exist? If so, where and in whatform? And why are the leaders of the Church of Satan so reluctant todiscuss questions of literal dæmonology?”Before we respond to this, a brief preface is in order. During the days ofthe original Magic Circle in San Francisco, and for the first few years of theChurch itself, little effort was made to disguise the literal core of ourdoctrines. At that time there were no Wiccans, pseudo-Satanists, journalist“occult authorities”, or dime-a-dozen Dark Shadows films reducing thePrince of Darkness to soap-opera status. There was only the Church ofSatan.We are all familiar with what happened next. Rosemary’s Baby,produced with the Church of Satan’s guidance, touched off an internationalfad greater than goldfish-swallowing, phone-booth-stuffing, hula hoops,and Zoot suits all together. Suddenly everyone was “into” the occult. If onewere swashbuckling, one was a Satanist. If timid, a Wiccan. If fuddy-duddy,a Theosophist or Rosicrucian. If sexually obsessed, a sadomasochist. Ifaltruistic, a Jesus freak. If chicken, a reporter or “observer”. But always anauthority.Satan himself became a tennis-ball. Prior to 1966 he was allegorical.Suddenly it was de rigueur that he was very, very literal - much more sothan God. [Do you remember that old Time cover: IS GOD DEAD?] Thensomeone made the profound discovery that “Satan” is a Hebrew term, andthat there were one or two other religions on this planet besides Judaismand Christianity. Immediately Satan was passé. The thing to do now was torevive the worship of the primeval fertility gods and goddesses over whomthe Neanderthals grunted. Finally some enthusiasts actually managed toregress past the Neanderthal stage to Krishna-consciousness, Scientology,and Guru Maharaj-ji.- 1246 -Is it really any wonder, then, that the Church of Satan withdrew “literalSatanism” from the public arena? In our pronouncements, publications,and press-releases the Devil became an allegory for materialism and theunchained human ego. Speaking in such terms we could continue to gainthe ear of the people who really mattered - the de facto Satanists of theworld. Had we continued to champion a literal Devil, media distortionwould have lumped us together with the nut elements, and our access toserious channels of communication would have been seriously impaired.Now we have reached the end of the boom. The Exorcist was the lastgasp. A few of the occult flower-children still remain, but they have becomerelics, throwbacks within their own subculture. No one listens to them; theyhave nothing new to say. One by one, rats deserting the sinking ship, theyquietly lay aside their capes, swords, and amulets. It is all over. Time to finda new toy.And so it is that Satan awakes. To his disciples who, after long years offrustration, are now minded to leave Rome, he appears - echoing God’sadmonition to Saint Peter: Whither goest thou? Having seen so much,having partaken of my knowledge, having known me for what I truly am,abuse not my trust and confidence. Return to Rome, and together we shallbegin the building of our new empire.Indeed Satan exists. Not as just a myth, nor as a mere psychologicalarchetype, nor as only a colorful figure of speech - but as an essential,intelligent entity. “You knew this, Winston. Don’t deceive yourself. Youdid know it - you have always known it.” The tongue in which his name isvoiced is unimportant, just as the shapes and substances of hismanifestations are unimportant. “God” is an automatic, non-conscious,dispassionate cosmos - in which man, yearning to be rid of the burden ofhis identity, seeks to immerse himself. Satan is That which has infused manwith this identity, thus endowing him with the key to turn the inertia of thecosmos to his amusement - to make of man a god.Would it surprise you to discover that the true Prince of Darkness is notthe “Devil” of Judaic/Christian legend? That figure is a simple caricature.Rather Satan is the true Intelligence manipulating the “God” of the Bibleand other “divine” personages, weaning man from subservience to all godsby making their demands increasingly intolerable.This is the truth behind all religious institutions throughout history:gradual deification of man despite his most determined efforts to regress tothe status of a non-thinking beast. While bowing before the Cross, man hasactually been succumbing to a Diabolical Double-Cross of such ingenuity- 1247 -and complexity that it staggers the comprehension. Call it, if you like, TheGreatest Practical Joke Ever Pulled. Or, to put it another way, humanity hasbeen had!Does it suddenly ring true to you, Satanist? Do you begin to see whatit’s really “all about”? Do the peculiarities of human evolution now fall intoplace? [Yet, if your mental block remains fixed, it is appropriate; the shockof “awakening” may drive unprepared individuals quite mad. This“awakening” is the actual Abyss whose existence is dimly sensed bytraditional occultists. Yet they have always failed to perceive its truefunction, and have failed miserably in their efforts to challenge it. For thosewho cross the Abyss, there is no return.] And there is more. Satan and hisChurch, however, time their pronouncements precisely. Within the contextof these dramas, comedies, and epics that continue to be enacted, varyingdegrees of ignorance and innocence are required. Besides, we wouldn’twant to spoil The Joke …- 1248 -- 1249 -Appendix 111: The Ninth Solstice Message- transcribed by Michael A. Aquino IV°Santa Barbara, California, ca. North Solstice IXArise! Hear! See with the brilliance of my Flame that has beenbrought before my darkened and blasted temple these longyears. I am Satan, and again the great angles of the Universeare conjoined that I may manifest my Will to this plane of Earth. Ihave constrained the forces of time that I may do this, yet evenso I am not full master of inertia, as the Cosmos is not entirely athing of my creation.I and the High Daimons of Infernus - that is Hell - have lookedupon the workings of my Earthly Church with pleasure and thepride that is our nectar. And we too have drawn life afresh fromthis Church. Did I not say that we had chosen to invest manwith our own life essence - that which, being not of the naturalorder of things, we cannot recreate from other matter? Ingiving man conscious life, we of the Daimonic race empoweredhim to order our death. Had Satan’s Gift been cast aside -whether from ignorance or from fear - Satan himself and allwho were wrought from him should face decline and dissolution.Yet, had I chosen to retain the Flame inviolate in Hell, weDaimons should have become guardians of that very stasis weso greatly abhor. In this matter - where we first surmised thechoice so great - there actually was none.The natural instincts compelling man back to a simple, bestialmode were so strong that - accented as they were by man’sdistorted fear of my own motives - we eventually consideredthe prospects for our final eclipse. But, while the Flame dimmed,it would not be vanquished. Man denied me, yes. But, to theimpotent and bewildered fury of Heaven, this very consciousact was my true redemption and victory. Do you wonder that Iso cherish irony? It has become the most reliable of all myoracles.Much was spoken of the ways and wishes of Hell in ourDiabolicon - that which was brought forth from Asia in the fifth- 1250 -year of my Age. Yet the Diabolicon warranted a certainobscurity of its own nonetheless. The method of its transmissionwas crude - the agent as yet untouched by the knowledge ofmy Priesthood. Only the eyes of him whom I had fashioned as aMagus looked and saw. Even so I set for him many tasks beforeI should again speak in this way.Hear, my anointed man, in whose mortal flesh I, Satan, havechosen to inspire my material Self - into whose keeping I havegiven my true Church - whom I have made Magister within theRealm of my Shining Trapezoid - whom I have incarnated as aMagus - Hear, now, Anton Szandor LaVey.Recall first the pact which, years ago, you drew up before me,and to which you set your own name. Think not that I havebeen unmindful of that act long past, pale and lonely though itmight seem beside the wreaths you have won from your ownkind. You could not know but that you risked more than yourlife - yet you stretched forth your Will through the darkness ofthe angles to seek mine. Though you have brought manyhonors to me, never was there such as this.Take now the pact. In that chamber which you know to be mostbeloved of me, build now with your own hands a Flame that issacred to me. Let your hands pass through the Fire - once foreach angle of my Shining Trapezohedron. Speak again thatgreat Key which suspends the barrier between Hell and Earth,that I may bear witness to that which you undertake in myname.Receive now my tribute. Our pact shall be consumed in theFlame, and with this act I release you from your bond with me.Through your alliance with the Powers of Darkness you havebeen granted knowledge far beyond that normally accordedyour race. And for this you have been manifest as a Magus. Butnow - of my own Will and bound by no pact - I, Satan, bestowupon you my greatest gift - for which there is no degree in my"},{"pageContent":"Order.- 1251 -By my Will, Anton Szandor LaVey, you are divest of yourhuman substance and become in your Self a Daimon.Henceforth you are as a true god, and it is in your power toalter the machinery of the Cosmos according to your desire. Nocharge do I lay upon you, for you are now my brother and nolonger my liege. But remember always the word we of Hell haveproclaimed. We need justify neither our existence nor ourdesires, but without a considered purpose - which Belial has setforth in the Diabolicon - both are without consequence.For nine years my Church has shunned the darkness andsought the light. Think not that the trials set before it wereeither random misadventures or the schemes of an unknownadversary. All were authored by me, the more to illustrate theparalysis of the God-churches. In truth they are engines of self-annihilation in design as in doctrine. This I will never permit myOrder to emulate.Those who honor the name of Satan have existed throughoutthe dim aeons of human history, as is well known to you. Yet,until you assumed the degree of Magus, mine was the namelessChurch. Now, for nine years, my name has been heralded, andthose who were blind in the light have learned that it is possibleto see in darkness.My Age has begun, and I am come forth to uphold my bondwith mankind. Yet I shall not illuminate all, nor even many - but afew. I seek the Elect, who in turn seek me. Man the god shallarise only from the ashes of man the beast - The blood is thelife.High Priest - You have made my name beloved. But a timeapproaches when I shall be shunned and cursed as neverbefore. This matters not, for the Elect will have seen my truth.But my Church must survive, and to survive in fact, it mustvanish in fiction. Out of the great darkness I have come, andinto the darkness I and my Order shall again venture. Therein- 1252 -lies the future. Those who choose the solace of the known willbe rewarded with death.Let the institutions of the Church of Satan be discarded. Theirtime is past, and they have served my purpose honorably. Seeknow the Elect, as the darkness draws near. No longer shall allwho approach my Church find welcome - They shall grasp atempty air. Only the Elect shall find what they seek.More shall now be said.Hail, Daimon! Receive now the Red Halo, and know thereby thatyou are become the Red Magus of whom Leviathan has spoken.- 1253 -Appendix 112: Report on the Sixth Eastern Conclave- by Michael L. McQuown II°(Letter to Anton LaVey, September 7, IX/1974)I arrived at the airport in Detroit at 5:45 PM on Friday, 30 August,where I was met by Warlock Grumboski, Warlock Levine (who had arrivedearlier by bus), and a Phœnix member. From the airport we went to thePhœnix Grotto, an apartment complex on Eight Mile Road. There was somescurrying around, dinner was eaten at the restaurant across the street, andthe party split up. I went with one of the Phœnix members to the Conclavesite in Windsor, and the others were to follow. During this time Iascertained that there are three other Satanic groups in Detroit of variousorientations, and that all are on speaking terms with Phœnix.It was nearly 11 PM when we arrived at the Viscount Hotel and reachedWarlock Hollander’s room. There were a few people there: Hollander, awoman named Lynne who seems permanently attached to him, WarlockMurray, Peter McAlpine, and one or two others. As advertised in theschedule, there was cheese and wine. About an hour later some otherpersons who had been out eating returned, including Mark Brown, JoannKeller, and Lynn Norton. Shortly after that the rest of the Detroit crowdcame in. By 12:30 AM the party had broken up. Warlock Levine had missedthe party, opting to stay at Phœnix and sleep. I returned to Phœnix with therest of the Detroit people; we chatted awhile and went to bed.The program began at 9 AM the next morning. Hollander officiallyopened the Conclave, and the next three hours were spent discussingConclave planning and administration. Like all the other parts of theprogram, it was both instructive and productive. At noon the programbroke for lunch, and several schedule changes were announced.The afternoon session began at 2 PM with a session called “PartiallyBaked Ideas”, an informal discussion of various things to do with theChurch of Satan. This began with a paper by Warlock Robert DeCeccoentitled “Suicide: Indulgence or Compulsion?”, which created a lot ofdiscussion and interest. The other topic discussed was various physicalsafety aspects of ritual: fire prevention, etc. Following this there was a briefconsultation of publishers of newsletters to transmit a few points fromMagister Aquino. The program was then closed for the day, to be followedby a dinner and a ritual later that evening at Phœnix.Present at the proceedings that day, and for most of the rest of theConclave, were: Warlock Hollander (presiding), Lynne Jarmon, Warlock- 1254 -Tom Huddleston, Witch Colleen Huddleston, Warlock Murray, MarkBrown, Warlock Lynn Norton, Warlock Robert DeCecco, Edward Brownell,Witch Joann Keller, Antoinette Zalewski, Warlock Grumboski, WarlockLevine, Peter McAlpine, and myself. With the exception of Hollander andLynne, everyone attended the Phœnix ritual, including two or more malePhœnix members. The ritual was a parody ritual on our own material,involving water pistols, squeaky toys, and party hats.After most of the others had left or gone to sleep, I talked at length withGrumboski and Larry about things in general and the Church in particular.Grumboski has made a point of keeping in contact with the other Satanicgroups, largely to know what they are up to, and to keep tabs on someformer Church of Satan members who are now part of a Nazi-orientedsetup - and the only one which really seems to worry Grumboski at all. I gotthe impression that his resignation from the Priesthood is only amanifestation of some deeper personal problem. Larry, among others, isdeeply concerned. No one seems to know what the problem is, but it seemsto be intensely personal.The pattern of Sunday’s program was similar to the preceding day’s,with the exception of the banquet and ritual at the hotel which followed.Regarding the hotel it must be said that, although in the middle of a strike,the management was able to maintain all aspects of the arrangements madeby the Conclave committee. There were no problems, and everything wentsmoothly.The evening ritual, conducted by Hollander, was a variation of theYezidi rite [from the Satanic Rituals] designed to create a strong sense ofunity among the persons present. It was conducted in silence save for themusic, and consisted of a circular sort of agape in which each member inturn served the person next to him with a flower, a slice of orange, a gobletof wine, and a fraternal embrace. The ritual was followed by a party in oneof the rooms. The next morning the Conclave was officially closed, and themembers dispersed.I have very mixed impressions of Hollander. He seems to be veryintelligent, very intense, and very neurotic. He is quite involved intranscendental meditation, so much so as to have quoted Maharaj-ji at theConclave program, and to have actually gone into meditation during amoment of stress at the Friday evening gathering. I get the impression thathe is a super-idealist, and wants a world full of peace and love. While this isnot the worst idea in the world, I don’t see it as too likely, and I’m not surehow consistent this viewpoint is with Satanic philosophy. I am not accusing- 1255 -Hollander of heresy, but he has a rather oblique way of approachingSatanism.Overall I feel that the Conclave was useful. It was productive and willgo a long way towards cementing the eastern organization together. It wastime well-spent.Additional comments by Stuart Levine II°: “The rite waswordless, but also ‘Satanic-less’. It seemed appropriate for a hippie weddingor Japanese tea ceremony, but not for a glorification of the individual! Theonly impression I got out of the ceremony was that it might have somevalue as a way to dedicate members to each other [something that mightoccur, for instance, on the last night of summer camp!]. Stephen Hollanderhas acquired the nickname of ‘Canada Dry’ behind his back, and the titlefits. He really ought to loosen up and get a better sense of humor.”- 1256 -- 1257 -Appendix 113: First National Conclave Itinerary(canceled September 1974)- by Stephen Hollander II°X/1975August 24: Participants will be arriving in Ottawa independently duringthe afternoon and evening, and will proceed directly to theLord Elgin Hotel, where accommodations have been arranged.Hospitality suite for informal get-together.August 25: After breakfast the buses will be ready for a comprehensive citytour, visiting the Parliament Buildings, Rideau Canal, Home ofthe Governor General, Military Museum, Home of the PrimeMinister, etc. Afternoon is free.

Lilith Sinclair, speaking last night at the Ramada Inn before thePsychic Phenomena Society of New Jersey, told her listeners that “Satan isthe natural force which rules the world, the opposite of everything thatfrustrates and restrains man”.Darkly beautiful, wearing a long, black gown open on both sides andheld together with black bands, Mrs. Sinclair was accompanied on theplatform by two Warlocks of the Church. In a brief talk before a lengthyquestion period, she explained that to Satanists the body and carnal desiresare “objects of celebration”. Materialism, self-interest, and the wish forrevenge when wronged are wholly natural, although society and other faithsattempt to repress these sentiments, she said. “Do what you will as long asno undeserving person is harmed” is the Satanist guideline.Where other religions revere a “supernatural, supreme being”, theSatanist believes in a natural force in the universe which is neither good norevil, but which can be tapped by the person who knows how to use his mindand free will. “People are always saying to me ‘We were taught this andthat’,” she said. “Don’t listen to what you’ve been taught. Use your mind.Ask questions. Find out for yourself.”Asked about exorcism and possession, she responded that a demonwould have nothing at all to gain by possessing someone. “Possession israther the semi-hysterical surfacing of an individual’s own represseddesires and lusts”, blamed on a demon or devil. “‘The Devil made me do it’is a good cop-out,” she said.Mrs. Sinclair was barraged with questions on the rites of the followersof the Church of Satan. Do they have a Black Mass? “No, there is no point init,” she said. “The Black Mass was invented in 1666 by a shrewd woman,with the help of a defrocked priest, for the amusement of the rich. Itblasphemes the mass; but since the mass is irrelevant to us, we gainnothing by blaspheming it.”Do Satanists sacrifice animals? “Absolutely not. Animals and childrenare sacred to us. They represent the purest, most untainted form of nature.”Do Satanists kill for thrills? “The people who do these things are sick and- 1260 -vicious,” said Mrs. Sinclair. “And not everyone who says he is a Satanist is amember of our Church.”Satanists do observe three ceremonies: the rituals of lust, compassion,and destruction. The ritual of lust is a love-charm designed to lure thedesired person. The ritual of compassion is utilized to help oneself oranother in business, health, finances, or other matters. The ritual ofdestruction expresses “anger, annoyance, or just plain hate,” Mrs. Sinclairexplained.Asked if such things could not bring about the death of another person,she replied that this could only result “when hate is repressed andrepressed and finally reaches the breaking point. If you can get rid of theseemotions in a ritual, it’s a catharsis - the safety valve on a pressure-cooker.”However, if a member has been grievously wronged and does wantrevenge, he may bring his case before the rest of the group, which thendecides whether to take “group mind” action against the offender. As inmany aspects of Satanism, participation in this is up to the individual. Mrs.Sinclair said, “If we do retaliate, it is done by the will and the mind. Wedirect this force against the other person like a laser beam.” But often themembers will seek to bring the two together and let them settle the matterface to face. “You can’t just throw this power around,” she said. “If youabuse it, your guilt feelings will do you in.”Members use the rituals and trappings of Satan “to create a mood, andbecause man does need dogma and ceremony,” she said. But the objects arenot worshipped. Her own outfit, she smiled, was worn “because it makesme feel slinky, and because - let’s face it - the public expects it. You oughttosee me some Monday morning about 8:30 when I’m getting my two kids offto school.”- 1261 -Appendix 115: “The Devil You Say”- from Psyclops, 306th Psychological Operations Battalion,U.S. Army ReserveFort MacArthur, San Pedro, California, February 1974Did you ever use the rationalization “The Devil made me do it”?According to Captain Michael A. Aquino, Battalion PSYOP Training Officer,this does not hold any water if you’re simply trying to pass the buck.And Captain Aquino knows what he’s talking about. The dark-hairedS5, who looks like a Transylvanian transplant with his arched eyebrows, isone of the Council of Nine, international directorate of the Church of Satan.As a Magister Templi, Captain Aquino holds rank comparable to that of anarchbishop in a conventional church.In discussing his religion, Captain Aquino states that the Devil isregarded as a symbol, and that “worship” is given to oneself. “Satan,” hedefines, “represents the individual human being raised to divine status.”Captain Aquino’s first exposure to the Church of Satan was in SanFrancisco. There he encountered Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey, High Priest ofthe Church, at the premiere of Rosemary’s Baby. LaVey had starred asSatan in that movie and had provided technical advice for it as well. Hefounded the Church of Satan in 1966. It has since grown to internationalproportions. Captain Aquino joined a short time later.While in Vietnam on active duty, Captain Aquino said that he neverworried about trouble from the natives, especially where his personalproperty was concerned. The Vietnamese are very superstitious, heexplained, and it was common knowledge that he practiced Black Magic ata bizarre altar in his quarters. “They didn’t dare go anywhere near thatroom for fear that some dire fate would befall them.”For the record, however, the Church of Satan is officially recognized bystate and national governments. Its officials can and do perform baptisms,weddings, and funerals. At funerals, the Captain stated, a Satanic Priestwould be more likely to celebrate the accomplishments of the person’s lifethan to worry about his future. Satanists do not credit theories of life afterdeath as logical.Asked if he does anything special on Sunday, Captain Aquino (theunit’s only professionally-qualified, unofficial chaplain) replied that hesleeps late except on USAR drill weekends.One of the Church’s slogans, however, deserves some thought:“Indulgence instead of abstinence”. “In other words,” Aquino explained,- 1262 -“one should live life to the fullest. Why inhibit yourself? You have only onelife, so get the most out of it.”- 1263 -Appendix 116: Phase IV Message- by Anton Szandor LaVey (“John M. Kincaid”)September 27, IX/1974ORDER OF THE TRAPEZOIDCHURCH OF SATANTo: Priesthood of Mendes, All Regional AgentsWhen the High Priest accepted the Infernal Mandate to assume hisoffice, a Master Plan for the long-range development of the Church of Satanwas instituted. This plan was divided into a series of phases, eachcharacterized by a radical readjustment in the overall composition andposture of the entire Church at a precise point in time. The success of eachphase depends in part upon a general ignorance of its successors. The Nineunderstand that a new phase must now commence.This past phase was introduced in June VI/1971 and put into fairlycomprehensive operation by December of that same year. Its most obviouscharacteristic was an aggressive decentralization of programs, publications,administrative communications, and responsibility. The Central Grotto,which formerly had been the instigating force behind almost all Churchactivities, now condensed its policies into a single guidance document - theArticles of Protocol - and required little more than monthly reports frommembers of the Priesthood, Agents, and Grotto Leaders. The approach topublic relations remained basically unchanged, with priority beingaccorded to establishing and sustaining our reputation as a legitimate,honorable, and sophisticated organization. Contact between variousGrottos and individual Satanists was encouraged, both throughpublications and via regional conclaves.The new phase is designed to strengthen the positive accomplishmentsof the last one while correcting its deficiencies. “As environments change,no human ideal standeth sure.” It will also reposition the Church to takemaximum advantage of current national and international social trends.Even more latitude will be granted to individual initiative; this in turn willforeshadow increased individual responsibility.Before going into the specific changes that will now take place, let usconsider the macrocosmic scenario:Although the resurgence in all forms of occultism that began in I A.S./1966 is now a thing of the past, the Church of Satan is still experiencing- 1264 -phenomenal growth and penetration on a multinational scale. Its name hasbecome a household term in Western society. Its integrity has been firmlyestablished. Membership costs and red tape have been held to a minimum.Yet there have been setbacks. While many Grottos proved to be stableand effective units, the majority of those which assumed a public profilefailed to sustain themselves for more than a few years, even though well-constituted to begin with. And the several regional conclaves, whilegenerally successful, provided the kind of ceremony- cum-coffee klatchatmosphere from which we now wish to stand apart.During the past several months the Council has devoted a good deal ofattention to this situation. Our conclusion is that we have encountered aparadox which, though seemingly negative to some, indicates that theChurch is succeeding in its long-range goals. This paradox is an importantone from a magical standpoint and thus merits comment:In conventional churches the masses are not expected to “advance”until they die. But Satanists are not supposed to be “masses”. They aresupposed to be - at least in potential - Plato’s philosopher-kings.Consequently Satanic Grottos with fixed, long-term memberships areparadoxical. New group-oriented Satanists will remain in a Grotto only aslong as they are being exposed to novel and increasingly-sophisticatedmagical techniques. Once they sense a leveling-off they will depart, seekingnew stimuli and new challenges. Thus a Grotto, in order to remainoperational over an extended period of time, must either sponsorincreasingly-advanced activities or experience a constant input of newSatanists. In this sense the Grotto must serve as a sort of miniature “Satanicuniversity”.The “Satanic paradox” affected the regional conclaves as well. Strong-willed individuals do not tend to mix well with other strong-willedindividuals over a period of several days. More than one conclave hasultimately caused more rivalries and misunderstandings than cooperativefriendships. Moreover the majority of members accepted in the past twoyears have indicated a greater desire to move among the seemingly-dead(non-Satanists), looking for signs of life. The challenge and intrigue thusassumed is of greater appeal than the potential rivalries inherent in groupactivity. Indeed the years have produced a breed of Satanist who is firmlydedicated to a concept, has the integrity to govern himself, and has thecharisma to influence rather than “belong”. These people seldom attendconclaves, but base their social activities upon personal selection.- 1265 -Hence the new phase will see an alteration of the conclave concept.Future conclaves, both regional and international, will be secret.Furthermore they will be by invitation only, to those Satanists who displaysuitable interest and aptitude in their normal undertakings. Authority forconvening of regional conclaves will be decentralized to a key official ineach geographical area, but he or she will in turn clear all registrations withthe Central Grotto before the conclave itself is convened.Admission to the Church of Satan will now become even more selectthan in the past. Prospective members must join directly through theCentral Grotto as members-at-large, even if there should be a local Grottoor circle in the vicinity. Admission and renewal fees will remain unchanged.III° and II° Satanists are reminded that they are under no obligation,express or implied, to lead less accomplished Satanists by the hand. Theadvanced degrees of the Church of Satan are awarded for personal prowessand potential. An adept magician who accepts students does so because heor she desires to do so, not because it is expected by the Church. NoviceSatanists should understand and appreciate this distinction - though it is byno means a new policy.The time has arrived to reach outward, that we may utilize ourcollective existence as a viable movement towards our ultimate goals. Inorder to strike out into a climate conducive to our philosophy, we mustexternalize our individual activities. Until now we have advocated unityamong members. Unity established us as a force with which to be reckoned.Now that this force has been established, further encouragement towardsin-group activity is unnecessary. As a body politic we stand recognized.Individual endeavors by members to seek out one another from within nowtakes on a dimension of ducklings huddling together to keep warm. Nofurther achievement can come of it. Only secular and personal dissensioncan result.Social climate conditions also figure in the profile of the new phase.Our sources project a marked decline in relative standard of living for mostindustrialized nations over the next several years. Popular tension will beon the increase, and dramatic and unorthodox measures will be taken torestore and maintain order. Minor, non-nuclear wars may proliferate to theextent that “wartime” economies become instituted on a de factopermanent basis.We are entering a very volatile social and political era. Many forceswhich will ultimately benefit the Church of Satan will be unleashed. TheCouncil intends that the Church of Satan shall be the supervisory influence- 1266 -of all that does in fact transpire. To be a Satanist in such times will be notonly to survive but to prosper. But an exacting degree of self-discipline anddetermination will be absolutely essential. Those who cannot or will not putforth this effort will not be carried on the backs of other Satanists.Each member of the Church of Satan will act as a unique agent. Aprimary requirement for membership will be one’s ability and willingnessto do so. For those who can lead, it will prove a blessing. For those who aresocially dependent, a disappointment. Either way it is ultimately Satanic inits evaluation of the individual. Hence each member’s role will be self-made, depending upon his or her individual accomplishments.No new member will be placed in contact with another, nor willexisting Agents, Grotto Leaders, or clergy be notified of new members. Onlyby this procedure will the potential of each surface. If social groups areformed, they will grow from the desire or charisma of an individual and willembrace like-minded Satanists. Formerly persons of diverse personalmotivations and interests were often lumped together solely on a provincialor regional basis.Certain individuals, because of regional, cultural, physical, and/orintellectual attributes, will be maintained as agents provocateur, and willbe selected to function as spokesmen, specialists, or liaisons as conditionswarrant.Grottos formed for ritualistic or social purposes will be instituted bytheir functionaries and attendees. They will exist as long as they fulfill theirpurpose. All Grottos will be formed through individual initiative, drawingfrom the outside rather than the inside. In this manner we can evaluate aSatanist’s potential influence outside his peer group and, microcosmically,in the world. Grottos will be sanctioned as long as they do not violatecrucial premises of the Church of Satan. No formal charters need nor willbe issued.Reports of any and all activities thought by members to be of pertinentinterest to the administration of Satanism should be forwarded to theCentral Grotto as they present themselves. This includes the activities ofgroups and organizations outside the Church of Satan as well as groups andGrottos within the Church. Routine reports of Grotto activity on a monthlycycle will no longer be required.Printed or recorded media observed by members in which the Churchof Satan, its leaders, members, constituents, activities, tenets, etc. arementioned, either implicitly or explicitly, shall be forwarded to the CentralGrotto, regardless of how trivial said material may appear.- 1267 -Those who hold the II° and III° have, with very few exceptions, upheldthe dignity of their stations. They have attained their status throughdiligent study and formal testing procedure. In our new phase standards forthese levels of membership must be altered in accordance with our aims.Hence examinations, written or verbal, largely relating to peer-levelcompetence, will serve as little criteria. Many other factors must beconsidered. The conferral of both the II° and the III° will be attendant uponone’s observable achievements and influence outside the Church of Satan.Identification of a member’s status within the Church will be continuedby established means. If suspicion should arise as to a member’s validity, amembership card will provide tenure, expiration date of membership, andidentification number. Identity numbers may be checked through theCentral Grotto.The Cloven Hoof will continue as an avenue of information, linkingSatanists together, though physically they will be dispersed.In the strictest Orwellian sense we now enter a phase whereby thecohesiveness of Satanism will be reinforced by its individuality anddispersion. Thus an empire will be forged which can be magnetized andrejoined ten millionfold at a future date. At present, in unity there is chaos;in dispersion there is strength. There are now more influential Satanists inthe world than at any time in history, for no single culture exists as arepository. All places on Earth harbor silent men and women who standready to come forth when the time presents itself. There will be those whoemerge today, as there were those of you who emerged before these wordswere written. Tomorrow there will be others. We will no longer huddletogether for mutual comfort among those who have demonstrated securityby their presence. The world is replete with potential Satanists with whomyou will find willing and productive companionship.As for your prey, there will be adversaries and challenges, should youwish to test your steel. But … Out There. Not inside. Those who havesavored the joys of intramural rivalries and sportive sedition must now lookelsewhere, for there are many groups, both occult and profane, which thriveon these antics. How often the Church of Satan, while proffering supportivetherapy, has succeeded in providing its ex-members with the most effectivemanner of aversion therapy available to them. In their animosity they serveus, for their identities as ex-Satanists are far more productive to our causethan they could ever have been as “loyal supporters”.- 1268 -This, the Fourth Phase, has been tested for two years and is ready to beimplemented. As we enter it, the groundwork for the Fifth Phase isunderway.Now few Satanists will be known to you, yet you will come to knowmany. In each gathering will be some who will respond to you when yourstation is revealed. And across the room another person, unknown to you,might carry the card of a Priestess of Mendes or Warlock of the Church ofSatan. We have proceeded for nine years - half of a Working - towards thispoint. We are entering a thrilling and intriguing area of our development.“How many are there which remain in the glory of the Earth, whichare, and shall not see death until the house falls and the dragon doth sink?Rejoice!, for the crowns of the temple and the robe of him that is, was, andshall be crowned are no longer divided! Come forth!, appear!, to the terrorof the Earth, and to the comfort of such as are prepared!”The Council of Nine[Seal]:Church of Satan, Inc., A corporate sole,Incorporated Sept. 20, 1971 CaliforniaWitness to the Seal:John M. Kincaid, Priest of Mendes III°- 1269 -Appendix 117: “Church of Satan Seeks MembersThrough Ad”- by Nadja MarilDaily Nexus, University of California, Santa Barbara, November 20, 1974Last month a mysterious ad appeared in the classified section of theNexus stating: “The Church of Satan, a non-prophet corporation, isconsidering an experimental collegiate Satanist circle at UCSB. Interestedhumans may telephone 682-1357 at midnight.” Those humans whoventured to call heard a prerecorded phone message telling them to leavetheir name and address and that the Church would contact them. In thebackground were noises described as “moans, shrieks, and candle-litprayers”.One student who called “on a dare” stated, “I felt it was a sincere offer,and it provoked my curiosity.” A few weeks later he received a letter andapplication form from the Church printed on red stationery. The letterstated that the response to the ad was “quite overwhelming” and that thepurpose of the advertisement and phone recording had been to weed outspies, cranks, and the idly curious. It also stated that in order to find moreelaboration beyond the material sent, those interested “will have to join us”.The letter went on to say that the Church desired no affiliation with,nor approval by the UCSB administration or Associated Students. “Ourhand will be everywhere, but it will never be recognized as such - at leastnot until it is too late.” As motivation to join, the letter outlines the Churchas being an exclusive secret society with exacting standards, which offersyou “the opportunity to become a god or goddess in this world - through thestrength of your own will and that of Our Lord Satan”. Satanists weredescribed as selfish although not unkind, since they manipulate non-Satanists for their own ends.Founded in 1966 CE by Anton Szandor LaVey, the Church uses theSatanic Bible and Satanic Rituals, both authored by Dr. LaVey, as theguidelines for its religious observances. The Church offers memberships ata $25 initial fee plus $10 yearly for renewal, as well as pendant medallionsand hardcover editions of LaVey’s works.On the membership form are questions varying from your name andplace of birth to “Are you a smoker? If so, to what extent?” More personalquestions include: “What is your sexual philosophy?” “Have you ever usedillegal drugs? If so, explain in full.” And: “If you are a female, would you bewilling to serve as a ceremonial altar?”- 1270 -Questions more on the mystic side include: “How many years wouldyou like to live?” “What is your personal definition of magic?” And: “If youown an automobile, describe it. What is your ideal automobile?”In closing its introductory letter, the Church quotes from Dracula:“Welcome to my house. Enter freely and of your own will.” The mailingaddress of the Church is located in Santa Barbara, but it refuses to answerany inquiries beyond requests for membership applications.- 1271 -Appendix 118: “Black Pope Simmers Down”- by Mary EverySanta Barbara News-Press, Santa Barbara, California, November 14, 1974The bizarre, black Victorian house in San Francisco once flaunted bymedia as the headquarters for arcane and profane rites now is barred to thepublic by an electrified, barbed-wire barricade. Although the movementbegun there continues to flourish, according to the High Priest himself,“There’s nothing doing at the Church of Satan anymore.” No naked altars,no curse rituals, no healing sessions. And Anton Szandor LaVey, theChurch’s reputedly flamboyant and charismatic leader, doesn’t live thereanymore.In Santa Barbara to escape Halloween harassment, LaVey explains, “Icouldn’t get much done there. It became such a target for the media andcuriosity seekers.” Staffed on a 24-hour basis, the infamous house is nowused mainly for administrative work. “When people inquire there aboutattending a ritual,” LaVey says, “they are likely to be told that the nearestone, if they are members, is in Albuquerque, Shreveport, or Louisville.”In recent years LaVey has forsaken the devilish pranks and black-capedpublic appearances that sensationalized him to become somewhat of anelusive world traveler. Thanks to some affluent followers, he and his churchhave access to estates throughout the world, one of them in Montecito. Andit was to Santa Barbara he chose to come on a most revered holiday forSatanists.In the suburban home of one of the Church’s local officials, where hissleek, black luxury car was parked outside, he related that he came here forrelaxation, to escape from the demands Halloween tends to put onSatanists. Speaking in a calm, pleasantly erudite voice, he explains, “SantaBarbara is an oasis in a sea of chaos these days. I thought I’d get the mostrelaxation here. To me Halloween is like New Year’s Eve to a bartender. Ido practice what I preach. Being indulgent and selfish, I don’t want tobecome a martyr to my own cause, to be besieged on the equivalent of asanctified day to Satanists.”Placidly poised on the sofa in the dimly-lit room, the LaVey of todaydefies his touted image. He is dressed conservatively in a maroon-redsports coat and black trousers - Church colors. His only concession toostensible symbolism is a small gold stickpin of a Devil’s head on his lapel,a pin that he claims once belonged to Mark Twain. He didn’t even don acostume for Halloween, which he spent, he relates, at “an intimate and- 1272 -tasteful gathering at the studio of a local businessman”. His conventionalattire at that gathering included a red corduroy blazer, black trousers, and ablack/red/silver tie, again Church colors.On the surface, at least, the controversial High Priest has mellowedsomewhat, although he’s still full of the Devil. Physical trademarks, such asthe barbed, Mephistophelian beard and mustache and the shaved headremain, but the symbolic, sharp-edged horns have retracted. In a vividpassage in his recently published biography of LaVey, The Devil’s Avenger,Burton H. Wolfe describes the 1968 appearance of the High Priest at aBlack Mass in the Victorian mansion in San Francisco:“Only the top of his head is covered, with a skintight cowl pierced byhorns made of bones … His garments are a black cassock covered by a blackgabardine cape with scarlet satin lining. His barbed beard and mustacheare Mephistophelian. His squinting eyes, glittering in the candlelight, areSatanic … For this is Anton Szandor LaVey, the first man in Americanhistory to organize a religion based on Devil-worship and to declare himselfthe emissary of Satan on Earth.”His warm brown eyes glinting a bit more good-naturedly now, LaVey,the still-reigning High Priest, explains that he is abandoning the theatricsand rituals for a more intellectually palatable course he calls “appliedSatanism”. “I’ve been keeping a low profile,” he says, hoping for moreobjective coverage. “I don’t wear symbols anymore. I leave those to thepeople on center stage. I encourage ritual, but feel it has lost a great deal ofthe emotional appeal it once held. The new type of Satanist is not theostentatious or garish type, but a substantial, responsible citizen. Many newmembers prefer Satanism inside rather than on the sleeve.”He says he’s particularly been shying away from a certain kind ofpublicity he describes as “the S.R. and T. (stuffed rat and tombstone)syndrome”. The sensational publicity about naked altars and other profaneand erotic aspects of Satanic rituals, he says, “were absolutely necessary” inthe neophyte days of his church. But, he adds, he no longer feels the need“to keep clobbering”; the point is gotten across that “we’re here. To getpublic attention you have to be rather outrageous.”LaVey seldom participates in group rituals now that, he says, his magichas become less Gothic and theatrical and more personal. “I prefer toperform rituals in solitude.” Claiming a paid membership of some 25,000throughout the country, the Church of Satan, says its High Priest, “is nowactually reaching its emergence”. So he feels he is not so much required inthe limelight. “After you beat the drum so long, you decide that if it has any- 1273 -merit, it’s going to be swept along with the tide. There will be others whowill say it for you. It leaves me free to move on to areas of applied Satanismother than the ritualistic aspect.” Such areas, he explains, includebehavioral control, cybernetics, creation of humanoids, and experimentingwith the influence of sound frequencies on humans.Before he proclaimed the founding of the Church of Satan withdramatic flourish in 1966, LaVey moved in some of society’s seamier circlesas an occult investigator, oboist, lion tamer, calliope player, and magician.It was while working as an organ accompanist in a Los Angeles strip joint atthe age of 18 that he became acquainted with the late Marilyn Monroe, then22, who was one of the joint’s strippers. A chapter in Wolfe’s biography isdevoted to their brief romantic “interlude”. At the time, LaVey relates, hewas passing himself off as 25. “I considered myself sort of a hotshot then. Iwas not a pimply-faced, rosy-cheeked kid,” he quips.An intellectual crammed with self-taught knowledge, LaVey is imbuedwith a cynicism that nourishes the sort of hedonism in which he imbibes.Occasionally in his conversation there crop up sardonic references to the“masses”. He admits to believing in elitism, the sort described in the lastphases of Plato’s Republic. Tapping a finger to his shaven head, hecomments, “If you have a 200-watt bulb up there as opposed to a 20-watt,irrespective of ethnic, economic, and social background it will surface.”LaVey is authoritatively outspoken on such views as: “I look on life as agiant comedy of errors. We are all selfish monsters trying to get out of lifeeverything we possibly can.” Satanism has a real purpose, he maintains, “ingetting people out of their shells and into living, throwing off thoseridiculous repressions.” Alluding disdainfully to people who turn against aPresident they elected when “bad things start coming out about him”, hecomments, “People don’t deserve any more than they get.”“The fact that human beings are so mercurial discourages me. But froma Machiavellian point of view it encourages me that Satanism will berecognized by that name as a major religion of the world. History hasproven repeatedly that today’s villains will be tomorrow’s heroes and vice-versa.”Upon leaving Santa Barbara, LaVey headed for Durango, Mexico,where he is now directing ritual sequences and working as technical advisorfor a new film, The Devil’s Rain, starring William Shatner and ErnestBorgnine. Traveling extensively these days, LaVey says he keeps “most ofhis junk” at a residence in the Napa Valley and at an “infamous” home inBeverly Hills, but that he has “accommodations virtually any place in the- 1274 -world”. A bonus of being the “Black Pope”, he notes, “is that, if you don’thave anything else, you always have a place to stay.”- 1275 -Appendix 119: “Anton LaVey - The SatanistWho Wants to Rule the World”- by Dick RussellArgosy, June 1975The black house is set back 25 feet from the road. Broken glass andspikes guard its roof, and weaving around its courtyard is a ten-foot-highcyclone fence whose long coils of barbed wire thrust menacingly towardsthe heavens. There is a small booth that hides a closed-circuit TV monitorwith a wide-angle lens which patrols the fence. Inside the grounds, its earspricked alertly to the night’s rhythms, waits a Doberman Pinscher. Its nameis Loki, an ancient word that means “Devil”.Near midnight a man begins his journey through the old house. At thetouch of concealed switches, a fireplace and then a bookcase revolve toopen a hidden passageway for him. The darkened ritual chamber waitsbeyond. Now he sits near the center of the chamber, one foot poised above afloor-switch that controls a rectangular black box near the far wall. Hewaits quietly, his other leg cradled underneath a sleigh rocking chair thatonce belonged to Rasputin, the mysterious figure whose powers dominatedthe life of the last Czar of Russia.The man’s body blends into the darkness because he is dressed in blackfrom head to toe: black shirt, black Levis, black socks, black shoes. All thatis missing is the black robe that he dons for official Satanic ceremonies, andthe black motorcycle cap that he wears outdoors to protect his shaven head.Now, as his foot brushes the floor-switch for the first time, his facesuddenly grows luminous in a surge of light. It’s a long, oval face. Below thehead he shaved in 1966 in proclaiming Year One of the Satanic Age, his earsare set back and distinctly pointed. In the left ear is a small gold earring. Agoatee and a mustache that stops growing at the middle of his upper lipsurround his mouth like a clump of thistle.The flash fades as rapidly as it came. Again enveloped by darkness, theman rises and moves his powerful six-foot frame toward the black box. Hechecks the two huge porcelain insulators that cling to each side, then the- 1276 -pair of protruding two-foot-long rods. 881 He advances once more to thesleigh chair, with a strange, graceless gait. It is a jerky, detached rhythm, asif despite his 45 years on Earth, living here is still alien to him. In thechairhe begins to rock gently back and forth, his foot hovering over the floor-switch. Long minutes pass. From somewhere in the chamber come the faintchords of an organ. Then, without warning, the bolt of light flashes again.This time it doesn’t subside.The voltage in the electrostatic generator by the far wall begins toclimb, shooting in violent spasms between the two rods, twenty thousandvolts … thirty thousand … forty … The chamber is ablaze with cascadinglight. The crimson-and-black walls reveal themselves inside incredible,gyrating, spiraling streaks, as if any second the room will lift from its beamsand rocket through the spiked roof, onward into the night sky.Forty thousand volts, and the air of the chamber is charged with thesmell of ozone, and the feeling of something shattering, ascending … Theman lurches up on his feet. One foot still on the switch, every ounce of hisenergy is pulsing as he stands in the center of a vibrating capsule with onehand thrust toward the sky. Alone and lost in the cauldron of his owncreation, he chants the same word louder and louder: “Rise … RISE …RIIIIIIISE!”Anton Szandor LaVey has a master plan, and he doesn’t think he willneed force to achieve it. He expects it might come to him as naturally as the25,000 followers who already carry his red card declaring themselves“Citizens of the Infernal Empire”. Before he dies, Anton LaVey believes thathe and an elite force of Satanists will rule the world.Since founding his Church of Satan in San Francisco on the annualwitches’ holiday of Walpurgisnacht on April 30, 1966, LaVey has becomethe central force behind the growth of Satanism in America. His SatanicBible has sold over one million copies, and he claims to have as many astwo-and-a-half million students. For years rumors have swirled about hisintimate relationships with Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield - and thebizarre rituals in the black house. Yet for some time LaVey has been all butinaccessible to the public. Moving between three California homes and881 This is a device generally known as a “Jacob’s ladder”. It normally reposedon thealtar in the Council Chamber, where it was activated on such occasions as thenecromantic Working concerning Marilyn Monroe [Chapter #25]. From thisdescription, Anton must have brought it upstairs to the main ritual chamberwhere thesleigh chair was located. It is open to question whether that chair belonged toRasputin,but it is a Russian antique whose beauty is exceeded only by its discomfort.- 1277 -retreats in the eastern U.S. and Europe, he has become an almost mythicalrecluse.Now, suddenly in 1974, he has come out in public - to the dustyMexican provincial capital of Durango. For nearly a month he’s beenserving as technical advisor on the location of a new film, The Devil’s Rain,not far from the Sierra Madre mountain pass where legend says PanchoVilla traded his soul to Satan for unlimited power. When I glimpse him forthe first time, he is standing on the porch of his hotel room on Durango’soutskirts. His image looms up - broad-shouldered and brooding upon thehorizon - between the shadows of dusk and the dim light from behind hisroom’s closed drapes.Coming toward him along a gravel path, I pause a few doors away. Is hereally so sinister, or is it all in my mind? Then, as if somehow he’s alreadysensed my apprehension, LaVey turns. His gaze rivets on me, and I have nochoice but to go on. As I introduce myself, his face shows a curious, almostchildlike smile. It dissolves my dark imaginings, and I find that I’mextending my hand. “In Durango,” he says, “I suppose I’m a captiveaudience.”He is wearing the familiar black garb, with a silver amulet of a goat’shead inside an inverted pentagram hanging from his neck. His words comeout slowly, punching out phrases in choppy stops-and-starts. He agrees tomeet me for dinner in half an hour. In the restaurant eyes rise and thenrapidly fall to stare at tablecloths, and Mexican waiters whisper amongthemselves. LaVey strides briskly, jerkily to a corner table, where almostimmediately a waiter is upon him with a menu.A bewitchingly feline girl named Terrazina has come to join us. She is22, an employee of the local governor’s office. Having met LaVey at a partya couple of weeks ago, she has since become a Satanist: the “Agent” for hisnewest “Grotto”.882 Tonight, after dinner, she wants to draw his portrait.“Terrazina lives in what used to be an old convent,” LaVey is saying. “It’s awonderful place - lots of legends about the ghosts of headless nuns makinglonely walks by night. All the rooms were nuns’ cells or old planked-floorclassrooms, and there’s an old upright piano in one of them. I sat, lookingout on the courtyard, and played for hours.882 Alias Irma Serrano, alias “La Tigressa”, who was included among the various“priesthoods” announced by Anton after the June 1975 crisis. She was nevercarried onthe Church of Satan’s membership roster prior to June 1975, nor did there exista Grottoanywhere in Mexico.- 1278 -“In California I have my organ in my inner sanctum. 883 It’s set up like abar, and one of my other prize possessions is there, a 1947 Rock-Olajukebox with the little spinning globe that makes flickering lights on theceiling. And I also have … my people.” LaVey pauses dramatically. His darkeyes glaze, and a half-innocent, half-barbaric smile crosses his lips oncemore. “Yes, I make people,” he continues, “out of polyurethane andfiberglass. They’re partially automated. I move them with solenoids. Isuppose most of them are actually disgusting human beings. Drunkfloozies, sailors trying to pick up women, and one of them even passed outunder the bar!”He chuckles loudly, but not a single head in the restaurant turns towitness it. “But I created them. So they become not reprehensible, butpeople you would meet at any neighborhood bar. Friends with whom yousit and have a drink. Sometimes I have one of them get behind the drums,and I sit at the organ. We play together for a few hours, real ricky-tick style,like in the fifties. And I’ve created another room, the perfect replica of acheap hotel, even the smells. Cheap booze and urine and stale smokepermeating the wallpaper, the neon sign …” 884LaVey pauses again and gazes wistfully into space. A chill passesrapidly down my spine. “I collect things,” he shrugs. “I’ve always collectedthings. For example,” he goes on, beginning to chuckle again, “there’s a guyat MGM who calls me from time to time. Awhile ago they’d had atremendous auction - the entire prop and wardrobe department - andafterward he called and said, ‘Give me ten dollars and you can haul offwhatever’s left.’ And there, inside the auction room, stood this huge boxbursting at the seams with the underwear of MGM’s most famous stars -from Greer Garson to Liz Taylor - with the labels still on them! What a haul;what a fetishist’s field day! It must have weighed 150 pounds, but somehowI carried it upstairs and a full block uphill to my car. Talk about a madman!I keep this collection in plastic bags inside a footlocker!”Uncontrollably I begin to laugh. Soon Terrazina is laughing, and itseems the whole restaurant - the whole world - must be laughing. There aretears in my eyes when I glance up at him. He is bringing a glass of wine tohis lips, grinning like a large whiskered cat. The grin brings me back toreality. In my mind I try to construct my next question. What of the group883 The Den of Iniquity.884 The remodeled Blue Room. At the far end of the room Anton had added a“light-box”window, “outside” of which the “hotel’s” neon sign could be glimpsed.- 1279 -ceremonies he is said to conduct behind his chamber doors? The legendaryimages of nude females with long blonde hair flowing down their backs,reclining on a coffin altar while LaVey, in his black robe, shakes phallicsymbols at his assembled flock …As if reading my thoughts, LaVey says, “I don’t conduct largeceremonies anymore. I’ve written two books that lay the groundwork forthem, and my own presence is no longer necessary. But we do have Grottosin every major city, and my Agents assist those members who wish moreguidance. Most of my people prefer to remain anonymous.” A deep silencebegins to hum at my ears. For an instant the restaurant seems no longer toexist, and I don’t know where we are, yet a strange calm possesses me. Butafterwards, as we walk to LaVey’s room in pitch darkness, the gravel pathfeels like teeth gnashing at my feet.885The quiet Terrazina takes a seat on his bed and brings out hersketchpad. LaVey opens a large suitcase stuffed with bric-a-brac, reachingfor a fifth of Early Times bourbon and half-a-dozen cassette tapes. Then,moving into his closet area, he returns wearing a custom-made white hat ofthe French Foreign Legion. From a tape recorder the soft refrains of “DeepNight” become his background. Nodding to the music, he lifts the bottle tohis lips and sits down on a chair directly across from me.Carefully I study his face. A blend of Gypsies and Mongolians andHuns, as timeless and inscrutable as the merger of so many strains in hisblood. He closes his eyes, losing himself in the music of Ramon Navarro,Hank Williams, the Beatles, and Puccini. “When the outside world speaksof you,” I say finally, “people seem to believe that you have certain powers.A way that you can exert influence over others and … can you … have youactually ever put a curse on someone?”For a long moment LaVey doesn’t reply, bobbing and weaving to themusic. Then: “Yes, there are certain tricks that can be learned. It is possibleto curse a person by working up enough adrenal energy so that you create achange in the atmosphere and it breaks through as a sort of gammaradiation. Like a force field.” His eyes open wide. Again there is thedisquieting feeling that someone or something is pulling his phrases alongon strings. “I hate to be cruel,” he goes on, his voice rising. “I resent itwhenpeople place me in that position. Nothing angers me more than that, andwhen I retaliate it’s not because I want to. I’ve just been pressed too far,that’s all. Like on the movie set the other day.”885 I can’t help wondering whether Russell had sampled a side order of thoseinfamousMexican mushrooms at dinner…- 1280 -“The movie set?” I ask, and there is no disguising the quake in myvoice. “You may simply say that a situation arose where I felt I was beingminimized. I was able to crystallize and direct the energy of some peoplewho felt the way I did. The results were rapid. Extremely rapid. I found Iwas soon blamed for all sorts of things. They were glad to get rid of me. AndI was delighted.”Now something else flashes in my memory. Something about LaVeyand another Hollywood curse. The year that Jayne Mansfield died in thatauto accident … As I frame the question, a new sensation sweeps overLaVey’s face. A profound sadness, even a glimmer of fear. Then, instantly,these give way to a black scowl and a look of hatred so intense that a pricklyenergy digs claws up my arm and advances towards my neck. I stir uneasilyat the edge of the bed. “Yes, there was Sam Brody,” LaVey is saying, “herlawyer. He worked overtime at being detestable, kept her doped andliquored up, and had guys fooling around with her in the bedroom while hetook pictures. If she ever left him, he promised to ruin her career and seethat she lost custody of her kids. He was despicable. Utterly despicable!”Jayne Mansfield had been one of the charter members of LaVey’schurch. He had been her confidante, perhaps her lover, and Sam Brody haddone everything he could to curtail the relationship. “Once he drove out toNorth Beach and told about 20 tough young blacks that Jayne Mansfieldwas inviting them to a party. He brought them all to my house, and theybroke through the front door. I’d really had it with Brody. I went into thebackyard and pulled the first bolt on the quarters where I kept Togare, my500-pound Ethiopian lion. I gave them five minutes before I’d turn himloose.“The police came just in time. They cleared my place. I was willing toconsider the matter at an end. Then Brody telephoned, calling me a crook, acharlatan, a con man. I was pushed too far. I told him that I had morepower than he could possibly imagine. I told him that he would be deadwithin a year. He slammed the phone down.” Now LaVey rises slowly to hisfeet, his face contorted with anger and grief. The last opera of Pucciniwrithes its wild strains through the hotel room, and somewhere clocks tickon towards midnight. “All I could do was warn her. I couldn’t be with her24 hours a day! The tragedy was that she knew. She knew being with himwas antagonistic to her own well-being!”In the early hours of June 29, 1967, precisely six months after LaVeyhad worked his curse, Jayne and Brody were driving on a Louisianahighway when their car slammed into the rear of a mosquito-spraying- 1281 -truck. “I was in my den, clipping a picture out of the newspaper of myselfplacing flowers on the grave of Marilyn Monroe. And when I turned thepage over, I saw there had been a picture of Jayne on the other side, and I …I’d cut straight across her neckline. Fifteen minutes later a friend calledwith the news. Brody had been killed instantly, and she’d been almostdecapitated.”From the cassette player a gong strikes three times. Barbaric, powerfulharmonies blend with a priest’s maniacal laughter in the background.Suddenly, catapulting between myself and the standing LaVey, I am sure Isee a bolt of lightning, a burst of yellow light summoned from nowhere, andmy senses careen before it as I follow its vanishing path down a long,endless chasm. 886Abruptly the music stops. Just as abruptly so does the shaking insideme. “Did you see that?” I manage. LaVey nods, and goes on keeping time tomusic that is no longer there. Terrazina has finished her drawing. So intenthas she been on capturing LaVey’s image that she’d become almostinvisible. Now she extends her sketchpad to him, and he gathers it gently inhis hands. “Oh, I like this one!” he exclaims. “A combination ofMephistopheles and Fagin!” The hour is late, I say to myself. Very late.Willing myself to my feet, I leave the two of them laughing over thecountenance of Anton LaVey.There is no rational explanation for the events of the night. They tossand turn in my mind, defying logic. The only thing I can think to do is riseearly, drive out to the set of The Devil’s Rain, talk to the cast, and later tryto catch up with LaVey in Mexico City. Now, as my car approaches abackdrop of old wooden buildings along a dusty, winding path, dark cloudssuddenly cover the sky and raindrops begin to pelt the windshield. Thewrath of Heaven seems to be unleashing itself upon Durango.“That’s very strange,” says a member of the film crew. “It never rainshere this time of year.” The storm lasts about a minute, then subsides, and Ibegin to ask around about LaVey. It is like peeling away layers of masksonly to find more disguises. “A bent Billy Graham” … “Reverend Ike with aninverted collar” … “Well, he didn’t snort brimstone, if that’s what youmean” … “Just say his brand of Satanism began to clash with the director’s”… “A stimulating conversationalist” … “A man of many talents” … “A trueconnoisseur of the arts”.886 Definitely a side order of ’shrooms…- 1282 -No opinion the same, and no one willing to be pinned down about theevents that led to LaVey’s early dismissal. But something is definitelyseething below the surface. Ida Lupino, who plays the Devil’s victim in thefilm, is wearing a crucifix, not only on the set but everywhere she goes inDurango. Ernest Borgnine, cast as the Devil, admits he has accepted anhonorary priesthood extended by LaVey. 887 Among the local Mexicanvillagers, who before had always welcomed the arrival of gringo filmmakers,even more portentous feelings had arisen. “I took a hunting trip lastweekend with a couple of them,” says actor William Shatner, onetime StarTrek hero. “Things went wrong that apparently had never happened before.People cut their hands; the oars of our canoe broke; the pattern of the birdswas impossible to follow. Finally the canoe tipped over. And these peoplewere sure it was the presence of the Devil in Durango.”I pore over all my notes. Had it always been that way? Had he alwaysbeen so many guises to so many different people? Years ago he had first“cased the mark” of human nature in circuses and carnivals. At 17 he hadjoined Clyde Beatty’s circus as a wild animal trainer. He merged himselftotally with the existence of the big cats. Sharing their hamburger on theground, imitating their growling sounds, crawling through the sawdustafter putting them through their paces, often sleeping in the huge, roaringcage below the big top. Sometimes a lion had turned on him, thrown him tothe ground, and planted itself above his helpless body, and Clyde Beattyhad marveled at LaVey’s miraculous escapes. This was how he masteredwillpower, LaVey had said.He had gone on to play the calliope, arranging music for the high-wireWallendas and Human Cannonball, and sending eerie organ chordsthrough the tents of the swamis. He moved on, playing the organ in aburlesque house in Los Angeles, and had a brief affair with a strippernamed Marilyn Monroe. When he joined the San Francisco PoliceDepartment as a criminologist, he specialized in “nut cases” - oddballs whobelieved in demons and haunted houses - and by the mid-1950s this son ofa traveling liquor salesman could be glimpsed on foggy nights walkingalong the bay in a dark overcoat with a leopard at his side. Soon he becamethe city’s official convention organist, and he bought the old 13-room houseof the most famous madam of the Barbary Coast heyday. He painted it887 Not true. Denied by Borgnine to Forrest Ackerman during an interview forFamousMonsters magazine, and by Diane LaVey in the May-June 1975 Cloven Hoo f.- 1283 -black and began to conduct a “Magic Circle” at midnight each Friday. Hismysterious reputation began to grow. 888Aging practitioners of the same Black Arts that he’d studied at 12 begancoming to him with their legacy of secrets. People looking to advancecareers - or private pleasures - took strength from his private consultationsand paid him with cars or even homes. At last, the year before his portrayalof the Devil in Rosemary’s Baby, he founded his church as a blasphemy ofChristianity that invited man to accept and even revel in his selfish, carnalnature. Indulge to the fullest, he proclaimed, and look forward to nothingbut your material existence.His first wife had left him, but their daughter and a second wiferemained his staunch supporters. And so his followers had begun to gather.Some, like Charles Manson, came to one ceremony and never returned. 889Others, like Jayne Mansfield, did not survive. Kim Novak, Sammy Davis Jr.,and a number of politicians and businessmen quietly affiliated. 890 It was aselect membership. Long before he acquired the converted convent in Italy,the mansion in Bavaria, the three oceangoing salvage ships at his disposalin Belfast891 , and a devoted Sicilian driver who chauffeured him in his blackBuick and guarded his 1937 Cord, LaVey had let it be known that he wasbuilding an “elite of the future”.As I drove away from the set of The Devil’s Rain, a Biblical image of agrinning Lucifer enters my mind and won’t go away.Forty-five minutes from Mexico City there is a little Indian town calledTepotzlan. It lies in a valley below the fabled volcanic mountainPopocatepetl and is said to be the magical center of all Mexico. Witches’covens flourish along its narrow, rutted streets, and foreign settlers stayprimarily on its outskirts. It is afternoon when LaVey arrives at thespacious weekend home of a short, stocky, baldheaded writer who made hisacquaintance in Durango. From his backyard you may watch the nearby888 As detailed in this history, everything in this and the preceding paragraph,except forthe Magic Circle, is false. Zoltan, the “leopard at his side”, according todaughter Zeena,was actually a big Burmese housecat!889 Manson never had any contact with the Church of Satan, though two Familymembers did. See Chapter #4.890 Neither Kim Novak nor any prominent politician was ever carried on theroster of theChurch of Satan during the years 1971-1975.891 All nonexistent.- 1284 -cliffs stab their spires into the heavens, and glimpse the cave where therebel leader Zapata once hid.“On certain nights,” says our host, “always at the same hour, a black,riderless horse will pass on the street outside. And the candelabra in thehouse will begin to sway. I don’t know any explanation for it.” Hearing this,LaVey begins to pass slowly through all the rooms, studying the white wallsand steel-framed windows, the ancient artifacts and placement of furniture.Then he returns and stands meditatively beside a swimming pool. “Yes,there is a trapezoidal shape to this house,” he explains. “Walls that areslightly out of square can exert a certain influence on a room, a disturbinginfluence …”The writer’s face turns ashen. “We built this house ourselves,” he saysnervously, “and there isn’t one square wall in it!” LaVey reassures him witha smile. “To me that’s wonderful,” he says.“But you know, it’s very strange,” the writer continues, “becausesometimes I feel as if this house owns us.” LaVey nods. “The Mayans andAztecs - and the Germans - knew damn well what they were doing in theirarchitecture. There are certain cuts of stones, bunkers in war, offshore oilrigs, and even a variety of jinxed cars all with one thing in common: anglesthat break tranquillity. This is the kind of house Marilyn Monroe wouldhave had. The house where she died was the same style.”He sits down beside the pool, positioning himself to view both thehouse and the mountains. “My relationship with her was so shortphysically,” he says abstractly, as if talking to the house. “But I was young,and a lot could be crammed into a few weeks. We were both flounderingwhen we met. It may have been the lowest point in my life. It was a muchmore romantic era then. 892 The style was to make love in the back seat of acar, in a secluded place. We used to go up by that Frank Lloyd Wrightbuilding on the promontory in the Los Feliz hills. His Mayan house. Wrighthad been putting the finishing touches on it when his houseboy wentberserk at Taliesen and killed seven people. It was said that the house wascursed. He built it for a shoe magnate, and the man lost everything in the892 As discussed in Chapter #2, Anton LaVey never met Marilyn Monroe.- 1285 -Depression. 893 The next owner’s wife jumped off the parapet. Marilyn lovedstrange things. We would stay there for hours.“I left her for someone else. All through the fifties I couldn’t bear to talkabout her or see any of her films. She sent me that famous ‘Golden Dreams’calendar, inscribed. 894 I keep it locked up.” After Marilyn Monroe died, hecontinues, “a wealthy doctor and his family had moved into her mansion.895The doctor refused to change a room of it. Even the same linens remainedon her bed. A year to the day after her death, the doctor’s mother diedthere. One evening the doctor left and never returned. I never went up tothe house until 1973. It was the night of the 11th anniversary of her death. Iwas drawn there, to conduct an experiment. I didn’t have any choice, andshe …” 896LaVey does not finish the sentence. The writer and I stare at him as hehovers by the swimming pool, his glassy reflection looming long over thewater and his shadow cast beyond the protective wooden wall and towardthe nearby foothills. “I’m sorry,” says LaVey. “I really can’t say any more.There are some things I can’t speak about. Even telling you this much, Ican’t explain why, just something about the ethers of this valley, this house…”“That’s one reason why I wanted you to come, Anton,” says the writer.“I wanted to see if you would feel it.”“Oh, yes,” says LaVey quickly. “There is definitely a vibration here.” Heglances over at him. “Would anyone like to take a walk?”“The two of you go ahead,” the writer says. “I’ve some things to finishup here.” A Moon is already coming into view as we begin to trace a pathleading out of Tepotzlan, in the direction of Zapata’s cave. “Do you believethat you will leave your mark on history?” The question leaps from me soquickly that it takes LaVey by surprise.893 Anton is referring to the famous Ennis-Brown House at 2655 Glendower Avenue,Hollywood, whose exotic appearance has led to its use in films such as The BlackCat,House on Haunted Hill, Day of the Locust, Blade Runner, Terminal Man, HowlingII, and The Rocketeer. The house is owned by a preservation trust, which givestours byappointment.894 As she later acknowledged, Diane LaVey forged the “Marilyn” inscription onthecalendar for Anton.895 Not a mansion, but a modest house (12305 Fifth Helena Drive, Brentwood, LosAngeles).896 See Chapter #25.- 1286 -He contemplates a moment, then replies: “I’d be maudlin to say that Ididn’t. I honestly feel that a hundred years from now, when most of theseWatergate figures are long forgotten, people will know who Anton LaVeywas. Selfish as it might appear on the surface, I also sincerely believe I’mdoing something that will elevate man’s self-awareness. Even if it’s a tiny,tiny, little step.”“But what about the future?” I ask him. “What do you foresee?” LaVeycloses his eyes, but continues walking blind down the shadowed path. “Theghost kings are marching, the midnight knows their tread. From thedistant, stealthy planets of the dim, unstable dead, there are whisperings onthe night winds and the shuddering stars have fled … The Satanists aremarching, where the vague moon vapor creeps, while the night wind totheir coming like a thunder’s herald sweeps. They are clad in ancientgrandeur, while the world unheeding sleeps.”The poem comes in a torrent, until the end. Then his words tumbleslowly, softly into the wind, and his eyes open once more. “Think of a cat onthe limb of a tree in the jungle,” he muses, “waiting for something to passunderneath at just the right time. He can leap any time he wants. But if he’snot hungry, he just lies there and lets antelope, deer, and other small gamego by. It’s just the knowledge that he can spring, that he has the powerinvested in him …”“Someday, then,” I say, “you envision an elite group, perhaps your own,taking control of the world?”“The truth about Satanism is far more frightening than anything peoplemight expect to see. Yes, eventually it has to be, if humanity is to survive.But it will be far more sophisticated and subtle than someone like Orwellever dreamed. It’s happening already. Like stage magic, you see? Theconjurer says: ‘You’ll observe this perfectly empty box in my hand.’ But he’sreally doing the trick with the other.”In that moment the many masks of Anton LaVey seem to melt beforemy eyes. Mad scientist, carnival barker, intellectual broker: All of thesemelt, then form again, one sinking into the quicksand of the next. Andwhen he turns to face me, it is the most terrifying experience of my life; yetI’m unable to tremble. For I am gazing only at slight-of-hand, at a facewithout a definable shape, a face both as charming and as monstrous as anyI could possibly imagine. The face of the anti-Christ.- 1287 -Appendix 120: “Anton LaVey Collects Big Little Books,Old Toys & Cursed Objects”- by Mitch LangCollector’s Voice West #IV-2, February 1974Anton Szandor LaVey has had a fascinating life. At 16 he became theyoungest member of the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra, playing oboe. In1947 he joined the Clyde Beatty Circus, first as a lion tamer and later as acalliope player (“The Great Szandor”). He has also been a policephotographer in San Francisco, investigating the “nut cases” - complaints ofghosts, dead dogs howling, strange noises in houses, etc.The Church of Satan was founded by Anton LaVey on April 30, 1966 asthe only church in America devoted to Devil worship and the glorification ofman’s carnal instincts. The Church now has 25,000 members who performthe magic rituals in chapters or “Grottos” throughout the world.Since childhood Anton LaVey has collected things most people try toavoid; his several homes are all repositories for cursed objects. The wallsare adorned with instruments of torture: a “witch’s cradle”, a “hereticcatcher”, iron masks, a Mayan witch doctor’s knife, an Indian Thuggeestrangler’s cord. An Aztec sacrificial knife inscribed “Where this goes, thereis no life” hangs near a bed, while a death mask of Queen Victoria lies,mute, on a nearby night table.LaVey’s private chamber is filled with animal masks from an early 20thcentury secret German society, devil masks from the Philippines, and avaluable shrunken head from Peru [LaVey has the recipe].A fond acquisition of LaVey’s is the legendary “Rasputin’s chair”, anornately carved sleigh chair made in the 1500s. Like many of the items inLaVey’s astounding collection, this chair has a curse on it. The antiquedealer who sold it to LaVey once threatened to chop it into kindling wood,and the next day he severely burned himself in a freak accident!Despite his abundance of grotesque and macabre articles, LaVey’scollections show another side of his nature, one he claims is as essential asthe first. He admits to being an incurable romantic, and he has a largecollection of comic and Big Little books, old toys, and world’s fairmemorabilia to prove it. His southern California home reflects hisfascination for “kitsch”, with lots of Art Deco and one of his proudestpossessions, a 1947 Rock-Ola juke box. Also a classic car enthusiast, LaVeyowns a completely restored 1937 Cord 812.- 1288 -Ceremonies in the Church of Satan include fertility rites to correctsexual problems, lust-inducing rituals, destruction rituals, and ceremoniesof blasphemy. Some rituals include the working of a hex or curse ondespised institutions or individuals. LaVey believes that it can sometimesbe essential to release hate; in this way the individual avoids venting hisbuilt-up anger on loved ones.Anton LaVey appears to be a complete success as the founder and headof the Church of Satan. Many people shudder when his name is mentioned,and his neighbors still tend to cross themselves as they walk past theChurch’s headquarters. LaVey insists that the Church’s primary goal is tohelp its members live their lives as fully as possible, and points out that“live” is “evil” spelled backwards.Anton Szandor LaVey collects Big Little books, old toys, classic cars,instruments of torture, and cursed objects.

Child of Darkness, prepare yourself to accept the soul of a long-lost brother. Renounce all heavenly gods so that you may receive from methe bonds of death and all earthly pleasures.“Eman Hetan!” Corbis chanted through his hirsute lips. “Eman Hetan!I am one with thee and thou art mine.

A torrentialdownpour. Inside her rain-pelted home, Mrs. Preston (Ida Lupino) waitsanxiously for the return of her husband Steve and son Mark. Mark, playedby William Shatner, has been out searching for his father and now returnshome alone. “I’m afraid Dad’s been lost out there … somewhere … in aflood,” he tells his shocked mother, who bursts into tears. As he isattempting to comfort her, an unexpected banging rattles the front door.When the door is opened, outlined against the wind & the rain & thelightning is a nightmarish figure. The drenched apparition resembles thefather, Steve Preston. If it is indeed he, he begins to murmur an incantationin which words like “Satanas” are to be heard. An incantation about theDevil! And as Preston speaks the blasphemous words, he begins to meltbefore the very eyes of his horrified wife & son! As his lips themselvesdisintegrate & rot, the last words to fall from his mouth are a name:“Jonathan Corbis.”The Curse of Corbis: In the 17th century Jonathan Corbis (ErnestBorgnine) had headed a coven of witches in the New England town ofWellington, a desolate community of Puritans from which the Prestonsdescend. Corbis had been betrayed by ancestors of the Prestons, who hadappropriated the secret volume in which the warlock had inscribed thenames of his followers, those townfolk who had made pacts with the Devil.Without the sacred book, Corbis was unable to fulfill his deal with the Deviland deliver the people’s souls to his Satanic Majesty. Learning he was inleague with Lucifer, the righteous townspeople seized Corbis & his followersand burned him at the stake. But before he died, he cursed his betrayers. “Iwill avenge myself on you all!”A Warning from the Warlock: A vehicle approaches the Prestonranch in the driving rain. Attracted by its lights, Mark goes out toinvestigate. He discovers it is his father’s truck - empty except for a tiny waxdoll attached to the steering wheel. The doll is in the image of Mark’smother! Corbis has made his presence felt again!Mark rushes back to the house to protect his mother. She’sdisappeared! Mark knows he must now track down the warlock and takes- 1294 -with him the amulet his mother gave him for protection. For addedprotection he takes a gun.At the end of a long drive thru desert country, Mark arrives at the townof Redstone. Here he is confronted by Corbis, who challenges him for thebook. Grasping his amulet, Mark cautiously enters the evil church.The Devil’s Disciples: Corbis’ coven members engulf Mark, and he issoon at their mercy. He is shocked to discover that his own mother is nowone of the unrighteous converts. They perform a series of Satanic rituals onhim, making him vulnerable to Corbis’ power when his sacred amulet isturned into a snake writhing round his neck! Mark tries desperately toescape, but determined, hooded figures inexorably close in on him. He fallsto his knees and grovels in the dust - a lost soul.In the Clutch of the Coven: Meanwhile Tom Preston (Tom Skerritt),Mark’s younger brother, and his wife Julie (Joan Prather) leave their workas hospital researchers and set out to find Tom’s family. Little do they knowthat, even as they are traveling toward Redstone, within the Satanic churcha brutal ritual is in progress: Against his will, Mark is slowly being driveninto the Devil’s embrace by torture.Arriving in Redstone, Julie & Tom immediately seek out the church.Entering it, they are confronted by Satanic symbols on the recentlyoccupied altar - the altar which was the recent setting of Mark’s suffering.Suddenly their attention is diverted by a crackling sound outside: Someonehas set fire to their car! A hooded figure is seen running from theautomobile. They give chase. Tom shoots. Tom catches up with the man,fights with him, finally subdues him. Catching his breath and taking abetter look at the curious captive, Tom finds his appearance waxen. And -shockingly - there are no eyes in his sockets! 900Captive of the Corbis Coven: “Get in the station wagon, drive to thesheriff’s office, and get him out here right away!” Tom tells his wife. Julie ismidway back to safety when, glancing in the rearview mirror, she is startledto see Emma Preston staring at her … her face waxen, her eyes blank. Julieloses control of the car in her terror and is captured by the Corbis coven.900 The role of this Satanic saboteur was played by John Travolta, before his“discovery”as a star. He had no lines to speak, but no doubt his fight and fall down thestairs in TheDevil’s Rain was good preparation for Saturday Night Fever. In the S.N.F. sequelStaying Alive, Travolta performs a dæmonic dance sequence - “Satan’s Alley” -whichjust goes to show what happens when an impressionable young man hangs aroundsomeone like Jonathan Corbis …- 1295 -Tom, meanwhile, has traced the sound of chanting to a gully. There hesees a ceremonial table, a gathering of cowled figures standing before it.Seeing also a pile of ceremonial robes, he dons one, concealing his facebehind its hood. As he moves closer to the figures in black, Tom observes afascinating but frightening sight: Jonathan Corbis, commanding theassembled Devil-worshippers, calling upon the supernatural powers of theRuler of the Netherworld.Satan, Prince of Darkness,Ruler of all evil things,We are your disciples,O most powerful of kings.Monstrous Transformation: Corbis bows his head in blasphemousprayer. When he lifts his head again, his face has been transformed. Intothe epitome of evil! The ferocious features of a goat demon! Tom sees hisbrother dragged before the transformed Corbis, who initiates him into thebloodless mass of anti-humanity. 901 Involuntarily crying out, Tom isdiscovered by one of the group and, when he tries to flee, is shocked to findhis own mother among those who are trying to kill him. Tom runs for hislife, Satan’s sycophants in desperate pursuit. As Tom shoots his pursuersand impales some of them with pitchforks, he is convinced he is in anightmare, for wax - rather than blood - oozes from the punctured bodies!He flees the town in horror.Souls Sold to Satan: At the Preston ranch, Tom is relieved to findDr. Richards (Eddie Albert), a man who is steeped in the study of witchcraft& Satanism. The doctor shows Tom an ancient-looking book and asks him,“Have you ever seen this before?”“No, never. Why? What is it? What does it mean?”“Well, I’ve been looking thru it - and also there’s this letter, which wasleft inside. The book is nothing more nor less than a ledger - pagescomposed of signatures of people who signed their souls to the Devil at theend of the 17th century. The Devil’s agent was a man named JonathanCorbis.”901 This is the scene described in Appendices #121 and #122. The chant citedhere byForrest J Ackerman was not in either the novel or the film. Rather it is anextract fromEdith Eyde’s Hymn to Satan, inserted by Forry as a compliment to Eyde and as an“in-joke”, since after Lilith Sinclair’s and my encounter with Eyde [Chapter #31],he wasnow aware that this was the key anthem of the Church of Satan.- 1296 -“But what has this got to do with my family?” Tom asks.“According to the letter,” Richards explains, “your ancestors, MartinFyfe & Aaronessa, were among those who signed their names in the bookand forfeited their souls. They were witches and warlocks - tho according tothe letter, written by Aaronessa, she recanted - but couldn’t persuadeMartin to do so. The letter also explains that as long as the book is keptfrom Corbis, he can’t claim his souls, and Martin and the rest of the sinnershave a chance to escape the fires of Hell if they renounce their evil vows.For 300 years your family has kept this book, believing they were pursuedby Satanic forces - by the evil spirit of coven master Corbis. And now itappears they have been caught!”Julie in Danger: Armed with rifles and the knowledge of who & whatCorbis & his coven are, Tom & Richards return to the town to save Julie &the Preston family as well. 902 They head straight for the church and a floorby the altar from which Tom recalls seeing a strange blue light emanating.“I’m sure we’ll find answers here,” he tells the doctor. Will they also find azombified Julie? For even now Corbis is moving closer & closer to her,chanting darkly. He bends over her, as tho to embrace her, his foul breathsickening her and the sight of his goat-demon face horrifying her.Tom & Dr. Richards pry open the lid above the spot from which themysterious blue light seeps forth. They behold a startling sight: a bottle inwhich lightning & thunder crack & roar! In which distorted, pain-wrackedfaces are distinctly visible! “The souls of the Devil’s Rain,” breathes Dr.Richards, “trapped for 300 years!” A noise at the church door causes Tom &Richards to turn from their discovery. They see the sheriff entering.Breathing a sigh of relief, Tom walks toward the sheriff (Keenan Wynn).“Have you found my wife?” The sheriff’s response is totally unexpected.Himself now a slave to Corbis & Satan, he approaches Tom with an axwhich he produces from behind his back!Brimstone Pandemonium: Dr. Richards comes to Tom’s defense.Between the two of them they manage, after a furious struggle, to push thesheriff into the pit. His screams as he falls culminate in an explosion offlame! Tom & Richards, catching their breath, now hear chanting voicesapproaching the church. The coven! Tom & Richards take refuge on thebalcony of the church and wait for the next development. Suddenly Tomremembers the book. He moves to retrieve it. Richards restrains him. “The902 The frequent use of “&” for “and”, and such spellings as “thru” and “tho”,are ForrestJ Ackerman trademarks.- 1297 -Devil’s Rain bottle - It will be enough to challenge Corbis,” the doctorexplains.When the coven enters the church and Tom sees his wife tied to a cross,he leaps from the balcony to rescue her - only to become a prisoner himselfof the Devil worshippers. Dr. Richards calls attention to himself bythreatening to destroy the Devil’s Rain bottle, but Mark Preston wrests itaway from him. The doctor now focuses his attention on Mark. “Rememberyour ancestor Martin Fyfe,” he reminds him, “and his wife Aaronessa. Sherecanted; she was innocent - yet they died in agony, burned alive at thestake!”Shocked to his senses, Mark seizes the diabolical bottle and smashes it!The impact of the ensuing blast blows a hole in the roof of the church, and aweird rain begins to fall on the frightened congregation. The coven isdoomed by the falling rain, a liquid of unearthly, acidic quality. The flesh ofthe screaming disciples of the Devil literally begins to melt! Corbis is besidehimself with rage! “Those who have defied the power of Satan shall bedestroyed!” the goat-demon screams.Bryanston, the producers, promise: “The concluding scenes of ourpicture bring to the screen such destruction & terror as have never beenphotographed before. We believe we have captured on film the mostincredible ending of any motion picture ever made!” Soon you can see ifyou agree.* * *WILLIAM SHATNER: It seems to Shatner that making the movie hasaffected people in and around it. Having worked in so many Star Trekepisodes which frequently concerned individuals who used mental powersto control others, Shatner feels that “it is possible for whatever one believesemphatically, to really happen”.Shatner sincerely believes that an “X” factor exists in all of us, and thatit’s plausible for this factor to stem from some extraterrestrial influence.“There’s an unexplainable something about mankind that has influenced allhis behavior thruout the ages,” Shatner says. “And there are too manythings that do happen that cannot be explained.”Shatner points out that the science fiction in Star Trek was imaginable.“There are so many things that we’re not even capable of imagining,” headds. Shatner has been intrigued by the various cults that have existed thruthe ages. “I’m just curious and very open-minded,” he says and smiles,“Perhaps that’s my ‘X’ factor.”- 1298 -ERNEST BORGNINE: It’s not every day that an actor gets to play theDevil in the flesh - a flesh & bones Lucifer realized thru elaborate makeup &special effects. Star Ernest Borgnine got to experience this in what could bethe most unusual film assignment in his motion picture career. “Borgnine isthe closest thing to the Devil yet seen on the screen - any time, any place,anywhere!” says the producer.“I had to go thru a lot of changes playing Corbis,” said Borgnine,“including at one point getting transformed into a goat-like image of theDevil, the hottest, most difficult makeup I’ve ever had to wear!”Borgnine tackled his role with considerable gusto, immersing himselfin the wide body of literature about Satanism and the occult. He broughtnumerous volumes on the subject with him. “But once the film ended,” saidErnie, “those books went right back to the library shelves. Getting the Devilout of you can only be a healthy attitude if the action taken is positive -never working against the betterment of mankind.” Borgnine feels a manwalks on this Earth only once and must treat each day as if it could be hislast.- 1299 -Appendix 124: The Devil’s Avenger Promotional Sheet- by Burton H.

Aquino IV°January 14, X/1975For those of you who may be new to our mailing list, the Chronicles ofMendes is the executive periodical of the Church of Satan, sent to all III°+officials. It is not published according to a set schedule; issues will beforthcoming more or less frequently as needed. We trust your discretion inthe use you make of included information. Should you have any doubtsconcerning the proper usage of any included item, just check with us. Yourcomments and suggestions are most welcome. Address them to: Church ofSatan, P.O. Box #243, Santa Barbara, California 93102.As the Chronicles is used more and more to disseminate administrativeinformation throughout our organization, bulletins to Regional Agents willprobably decrease or cease altogether. Thus you should consider it yourresponsibility to keep any II° Agents in your area of operation abreast ofappropriate material. Remember that the Hoof will continue to referSatanists to these Agents for information which, for one reason or another,is not printed in the Hoof. [Bear in mind that the Hoof is made available toa carefully-selected group of nonmembers in various parts of the world.Accordingly each issue is designed both as an informational vehicle and apublic relations medium. By contrast the Chronicles is sent to no one who isnot an initiate of the Satanic Priesthood. Hence it may include sensitiveitems of interest and concern.]Some of you have held the Priesthood since I/1966 A.S., while othershave been ordained within the last six months of IX/1974. Obviously thereare a good many different attitudes about the Priesthood floating around,ranging from hyperfundamental to hyperallegorical. Let’s start the newyear, therefore, with some comments concerning the profile of the SatanicPriesthood.The Church of Satan is not about to insult anyone’s intelligence byclaiming hoary antiquity for its clerical order. We’ll leave that to theRosicrucians. The Devil’s Avenger will give you a pretty good idea of howthe Priesthood evolved - from senior Witches and Warlocks of the originalMagic Circle (Phase I), to a dual-function system of Satanic Priests andSatanic Ministers (Phase II), to the present Priesthood of Mendes(commencing with Phase III). As the programs and activities of the Churchbecame more sophisticated and decentralized, increasingly moredemanding standards were instituted for the III°. At the present time an- 1302 -individual is ordained only if the Nine feel that he or she can step intoalmost any conceivable social situation and represent the Church withforcefulness, dignity, and purpose.Ostensibly, of course, the Priesthood serves as the link between theesoteric and the exoteric Church of Satan. To the majority of Satanists, ourPriests and Priestesses are the Church. If we are to continue expanding ourentire sphere of influence around the world, it is from the III° that theinitiative must come. While you may receive guidance from IV°+ officials,you are essentially on your own. Such are the provisions of our Mandateand of the Master Plan. As ordained Satanists, however, you bear a veryspecial charge: You are the material embodiment of the Powers ofDarkness.Were we not acting with the conviction that Our Lord Satan and theDæmonic entities enjoy factual existence, the Church of Satan would bemaking a mockery of its name. [In that case we would be not muchdifferent from an existentialist society, a sociological group, or a humanistinstitution.] But we are quite serious about the literal nature of the Churchof Satan. Bluntly, this involves the principle that intelligent humanity is thedeliberate experiment of a preexisting and more advanced form of finiteintelligence. The reasoning behind this assumption has been set forthamply in the Hoof over the past several years. But there are some factorswhich have not been explored in the Hoof.One danger, obviously, lies in being too quick to visualize the Powers ofDarkness in terms of trite, superstitious folklore. 95% of such portraits -from Margaret Murray to Dennis Wheatley - are so childish that you wouldhave a perfect right to feel a little ridiculous for championing a religionbased upon them. But, as the Satanic Bible emphasizes again and again, theChurch of Satan has reformulated the entire picture from Scratch (!). Whileoutwardly portraying the Devil and his minions in traditional terms forpublicity and psychodramatic impact, we have researched the entirescenario of initiatory occultism and ceremonial Black Magic from groundzero. Proceeding with what we consider a far more substantive criticalframework than the Cartesians or the existentialists [to name tworeductionist schools], we have arrived at a Weltanschauung that we believethe most advanced - and accurate - ever assembled.As holders of the Black Baphomet, you possess the sophistication tograsp this material. It is difficult to explain to most humans, however,whether lay Satanists or members of the public. The average human mind- 1303 -incorporates a conditioned psychological “defense mechanism” against itsimplications.The first paragraph on page #40 of the Satanic Bible outlines theconcept of “God” in the clearest possible terminology. This term identifies"},{"pageContent":"the non-conscious inertia of the Universe - the “law” of all regularity ofbehavior, balance, thermodynamics, relativity, sequential prediction, etc.This inertia influences both living and non-living substances. We know itsinfluence upon living organisms as “instinct”, and also through suchphenomena as “crowd-consciousness”, mass hysteria, dogmatism,conformism, and the tendency towards blind obedience to law andestablished order. Juxtaposed to this inertia stands only one thing: humanawareness of the self, whereby we perceive ourselves as individual entitiesdistinct and apart from an automatic, Universal “machine”. Our livesbecome a constant struggle between the desires of our Will and thecompulsions of our “God”-dictated instinct. In the mythologies of primitivecultures, this struggle was represented as “evil” (the willful self) vs.“good” (the natural norm).As was touched upon in “Quo Vadis? ” [Appendix #110], allconventional religious traditions have a common chord. That chord is theobliteration of the willful personality and the consequent re-identificationof the self with “God”.People look about them and see that they are apparently controllingtheir behavior and their environment more than they are being controlledby them. Just the opposite is true for other forms of animal life.The advanced human senses something in his intellectual constitutionthat is independent of “God”. Yet this force is not yet strong enough so thatenvironment and instinct may be completely disregarded or controlled.This uncertainty creates and sustains a continuous, all-pervasiveneurosis. People can’t stand being balanced on such a precarious fulcrum.They want the situation to be resolved, one way or the other. Either theywant to abandon their independent consciousness and become part of“God”, or they want to strengthen their independence, cast off as much aspossible their dependence upon “God”, and break the behavioral bonds thattie them to the Universal inertia. Those in the former category are theists;those in the latter are Satanists.Atheists and agnostics consider themselves superior to either. In factthey are inferior to both. By their indecision they have demonstrated thattheir minds are simply too weak to confront the problem. They areostriches with their heads in the sand, believing that the dilemma will go- 1304 -away if they can’t “see” it. In this sense they are intellectual eunuchs, andthe question of the consequence of human existence will be decided withoutthem. [This evaluation does not include those A&As whose condition istransitory en route from conditioned theism to Satanism.]It is true that we hold theists and their institutions in pity andcontempt, but it is not true that we are obliged to hate them. They areannoying to us because they outnumber us, and because their psychologicaldefense mechanism includes a certain intolerance and ostracism of knownSatanists. People who have “destroyed” their own minds are offended andirritated by the happy and prosperous existence of those who are gloryingin their intellectual independence.The Satanist is a living reminder to the theist of that theist’s mentalinadequacy. This being the case, the theist will attempt to ridicule, remove,and/or destroy the Satanist. The history of human civilization providesample evidence of this. The Church of Satan has survived and prospered fortwo basic reasons: (1) We have “covered” ourselves with a public image ofburlesque and, in the words of Time, “plain old carnival hokum”. (2) Theera and host culture in which we exist are relatively liberal.Our isolationist attitude towards Wiccan and pseudo-Satanic groups isnot because we fear them as potential rivals. [As a matter of fact, we havediplomatic relations with scores of authentic Satanic groups in this countryand elsewhere.] It is simply because they are nothing more than a variantmanifestation of theism, couching theist doctrines in pagan guise. Wedislike such groups because they themselves try to include us in their basketand then, failing that, denounce us as being a “black sheep” of organizedoccultism. They wish to partake of our glamor and success while denying itssource. Furthermore, those people who join the Church of Satan accept acertain social risk in doing so. We do not like to see this risk augmented bythe stupid antics of other occultists.Now all those who profess to be theists are not necessarily so. In Hoof#IV-8 we made passing reference to Pope Paul being a quasi-Satanist. Thissubject was under consideration as the basis for a lead article in a futureHoof, but it was dropped as being potentially adverse to the worldwideinterests of Satanism. Were we to expose Satanism in high-level theistcircles, we might provoke purges and revolutions. This, obviously, wouldnever do.As a rule of thumb, the top leadership in all of the world’s establishedreligious institutions are clandestine, de facto Satanists. This is well-nighmandatory, as they must speak for the god(s) they “worship”.- 1305 -On one hand they may derive considerable satisfaction from this role,since it permits them to manipulate vast numbers of people for their (theleaders’) comfort and profit. Yet they are also “riding the tiger”. If theirdeception should become known, they would be subject to vicious attack bytheir disillusioned flock.Occasionally this has happened. A recent issue of Time, for example,cited the plight of evangelist Garner Ted Armstrong, whose Satanic life-style has put him in dutch with his flock. Fortunately most low- andmedium-level theists are too stupid to mount revolts against their leaders -and too dogmatic even to believe anything ill of them.Now you see one of the reasons why Dr. LaVey chose to acceptappointment as a Catholic bishop. 903 For that matter, there are many otherofficials of the Church of Satan who hold executive or advisory positions intheist institutions. 904 With few exceptions, obviously, such “double-agents”must safeguard their anonymity. Consider the implications of the Fifth andFifteenth Enochian Keys.Now let us take a fresh look at the internal machinery of the Church ofSatan. Why the “rote” rituals and Hollywood/Gothic trappings? If theproto-human intelligences we emulate are so sophisticated, why shouldthey be impressed by flamboyant incantations, staged pyrotechnics, andexotic rites? The answer to this is that the rituals and ceremonies of the“rote” variety are not valid for influencing the Powers of Darkness, norwere they ever intended to be. Rather they are designed for the educationand evolution of novice Satanists.Consider this at length. Under ritual conditions the magician proclaimsand caricatures various impulses of his normal personality. He casts off, soto speak, various parts of his Reichian character armor. By doing so hecomes to know himself better - to identify and appreciate the instinctivecomponents of his personality. Recognizing them, he can control and directthem. The more the subconscious mind is dominated by the consciousmind, the more Satanic the individual becomes. Basic Satanic ritual is a903 Or so I could only suppose. The account of Anton’s secretly being made abishopsurfaced for the first time in The Devil’s Avenger, and I have neither seenproof of it orheard it referred to at any other time. I now assume it was not true.904 A gesture to John Ferro, whose continuing connections with Catholicism hadbeendiscussed in The Devil’s Avenger, and who continued to be an adjunct facultymemberof the [Catholic] University of San Francisco.- 1306 -psychodramatic means to a Satanic end. The practitioner of Satanic ritualwill come to see all ritualism in human life for what it really is.And our rituals are somewhat like Shakespeare’s plays: It doesn’t doany good to just read them. They must be performed. When and if theNine sense that a particular Satanist has attained this stage of awarenessand control, the Satanist is considered as a candidate for the III°.Ritual does not cease to have meaning for the III°+ Satanist. In fact itnow becomes truly operative for the first time. The III° Satanist identifiesconsciously with the Powers of Darkness. He may speak with them and forthem. Ritual becomes a communion, whose “language” may be mental,physical, verbal, or musical. It contains no rote aspects that are notrecognized as such and inserted for dignity and atmosphere. Nor does theIII° magician have any reason to ask favors of the Dæmonic entities, sincehe has already been granted their greatest gift - the complete awarenessand control of his Will. As you have recognized or will shortly recognize, thepower of the unleashed Will is virtually limitless.Writers of Gothic novels have made much of the “one-way street”aspect of Satanism. As a matter of fact they happen to be right on the mark.But the phenomenon has nothing to do with force or compulsion. It can beexplained in terms of Satanism’s being an evolution of intelligence.It is a practical impossibility for an intelligent person to “make himselfstupid”. Satanists may regress through neurosis, senility, mental illness, orprefrontal lobotomy. Or - and this is the key to contests between magicians- through being presented with situations that force instinct to the fore.As for members of the Church of Satan who defect, it is erroneous tothink of them as Satanists who have chosen to become non-Satanists. Morecorrectly they are persons who never really became true Satanists, butsimply went through the motions for the superficial fun of it.Yes, the Church of Satan is indeed the outrageous, provocative circusportrayed in The Devil’s Avenger. But in actuality it is a Circus of Dr. Lao,which, by applying certain pressures and offering certain escapes to specificmembers of the “audience”, exerts types of changes upon them. Non-Satanist metamorphs are exploited for the benefit of their Sataniccounterparts. Then, too, most of those who buy tickets to the Circus of Dr.LaVey - like their Lao prototypes - remain ignorant of the changes beingwrought upon them. Those who catch on become candidates for thePriesthood of Mendes. These are the Elect.- 1307 -Appendix 126: “Sic Itur Ad Astra”- by Michael A. Aquino IV°The Cloven Hoof #VII-2, March/April X/1975As the other organizational components of the Church of Satan haveevolved over the years, so has its membership degree system. The fivemagical degrees of Satanism were first outlined in Hoof #II-11, and anupdate was printed in Hoof #IV-3. We now think it time to review thesystem once again, both because of certain refinements to its structure andbecause the Church membership has increased substantially in the pastthree years.Practically every magical society from the Pythagoreans through theIlluminists has incorporated a multilevel membership system. The use offormal divisions between such levels derives from the initiatory nature ofthe Black Arts. As one reaches a certain level of personal skill andsophistication, the initiatory order releases knowledge whose application isappropriately powerful.A second reason for the degree system is that it enables initiates from anumber of different backgrounds and geographic locales to identifysubordinates, peers, and superiors instantaneously.We feel that the degree system used by the Church of Satanincorporates the most important features of magical initiatory stages, andwe also feel that it avoids the pitfalls of prior systems. [The degrees of otherorders have been subjected to widespread abuse - from reduction to emptyceremonial use in Masonry to financial exploitation in the A.'.A.'. andO.T.O.].Satanist I° - When the Council of Nine approves an application formembership in the Church, it states in effect that the Church accepts theendorsement of that applicant and will permit the extension of its power,influence, and reputation to that person. It is important to note that thisdecision is not taken at all lightly, because the Church is extremelyparticular about the sort of person who represents it.Because the majority of Satanists pursue personal interests not directlyconnected with the Church organization, the I° - which grants membershipbenefits but requires no reciprocal responsibilities - is ideal for them. Inthis context it is an end in itself and should not be regarded as merely a“training” degree. The title of the degree serves to emphasize this; one iseither a Satanist or one is not.- 1308 -The colors of the I° Baphomet are red and silver. While there are nolonger any formal restrictions concerning color or style of ritual robes,black is the traditional color of Satanism where attire is considered.Witch or Warlock II° - While the I° implies the Church’s acceptanceof endorsement by a certain individual, it does not certify the Church’sreciprocal endorsement of that individual as an effective and accomplishedSatanic magician. Our membership is simply too large to permit us to makea detailed evaluation of everyone who wants to be a Satanist.When we do make such an evaluation and decide that the Satanist inquestion is adept at comprehending and utilizing the contents of theSatanic Bible, the II° is granted. In one sense the II° is the highestrecognition possible within a true Satanic order, because Satanism ischaracterized by diversity of individual technique. Once the Church issatisfied that a certain member is a capable magician, that is all that needbe said.Until the new Phase, a written examination was used to evaluateaspirants to the II°. We never felt completely happy about such amechanical procedure, and it has now been dropped. Henceforth the II°will be awarded strictly on an individual-case basis. A person may besingled out for appraisal upon the initiative of the Church, or a I° memberdesiring elevation may take the initiative to convince the Church that he orshe is deserving of the II°. This may be approached in any number of ways,depending upon the style, interests, and ingenuity of the aspirant.The II° Baphomet is white and silver. And for the record: Witches arefemale and Warlocks are male.Priest or Priestess of Mendes III° - In other churches the priest orminister is simply a semiprofessional or professional organizer,demagogue, and ringmaster. He is also considered to be a shepherd,charged with the moral and spiritual guidance of his flock.The Satanic Priest is altogether different in concept. He is chosen forordination not by other humans, but by the Powers of Darkness, whoaccentuate his characteristics and achievements in such a fashion as toidentify him as Elect to the Council of Nine. Once declared Elect by theNine, an individual has the choice to accept or reject formal ordination. Ifhe declines, he retains full control of his Will and continues normalexistence.Should he accept, he will find that his life will be warped in unforeseenand often strange directions, as the Powers of Darkness actualize the Will of- 1309 -Our Lord Satan through him. Simultaneously he will come to wield powersthat will permit no obstacle to stand before him.The Satanic Priesthood takes its name from the ancient EgyptianPriesthood of Set, which was centered in the vicinity of Mendes ( Ba-neb-tett) and Tanis during the latter days of the empire. Insignia of the degree isthe Sigil of Baphomet in black and silver.The Priest has no organizational responsibility towards the generalmembership of the Church of Satan, interacting with groups or individualmembers only according to his Will or the mandates of the Powers ofDarkness.There are no standard procedures through which one may aspire to theIII°, but Satanists who feel a strong desire to attain this degree should sonotify the Nine.Magister IV° - This degree is conferred by the High Priest in one ofthree designations: Master of the Cavern (Magister Caverni), Master of theTemple (Magister Templi), or Grand Master (Magister Magnus). Thedegree and its designations refer to the recipient’s expertise and scope ofmagical influence, not to a strict administrative or geographical hierarchywithin the Church of Satan per se.A detailed discussion of the IV° is beyond the scope of the Hoof, butwill be included in a forthcoming issue of the Chronicles of Mendes,newsletter of the Satanic Priesthood. Insignia of the IV° is a blue and silverBaphomet.Magus V° - This is the highest degree conferred within the authority ofthe Mandate of the Church of Satan, reflecting the Will of the Prince ofDarkness himself. Presently it is held only by Anton Szandor LaVey.Like the IV°, the V° is a measure of an individual and not thedesignation of an organizational function. Insignia of the V° is a purple andsilver Baphomet. A forthcoming issue of the Chronicles of Mendes willdiscuss the magical attributes of the title.The Order of the Trapezoid - Formal membership in the Church ofSatan appeals to and is appropriate for a relatively specialized category ofindividuals within the entire spectrum of humanity. Thus the Church ofSatan is an esoteric organization. But Satanism also embodies anexoteric aspect, since - to put it succinctly - it involves a glorification andan evolution of human nature.Hence the Order of the Trapezoid serves as a means to identify andrecognize de facto Satanists who are accomplished at what might be termedapplied Satanism. This means that, while such individuals may not be- 1310 -ceremonial magicians in the traditional sense, they regularly employ theprinciples of the Satanic philosophy in their dealings with society - andenjoy a high degree of success in doing so. It follows that the Church ofSatan and the Order of the Trapezoid are complementary in the geometricsense. An individual may be a member of both organizations, but a positionin one has no ex officio bearing upon a position in the other. Membershipin the Order of the Trapezoid is by invitation only.The Council of Nine - The Council serves as the executive committeeof both the Church of Satan and the Order of the Trapezoid. Its seal,consequently, incorporates both the trapezoid and the inverse pentagram,together with the Devil’s trident symbolizing the Infernal Mandate of bothorganizations. The Council is composed of eight individuals selected by theHigh Priest, who is the ninth member as well as the chairman of theCouncil. The identities of the Nine may be known or concealed, and thecomposition of the Council may vary with the passage of time.The High Priest - As Exarch of Our Lord Satan, the High Priest holdsfull and final authority for the Church of Satan and the Order of theTrapezoid. Insignia of the office is a lightning bolt superimposed upon asilver inverse pentagram. The office is presently held by the founder of boththe Church and the Order, Anton Szandor LaVey. His consort, Diane LaVey,holds the complementary office of High Priestess.- 1311 -Appendix 127: Draft Lead Articles- by Michael A. Aquino IV°for The Cloven Hoof #VIII-3, May/June X/1975(both rejected by Anton LaVey)À Bon Chat, Bon RatEvidently we led with our chin last issue, because the Central Grottohas since received a ton and a half of mail from (a) Satanists wishing tobecome Warlocks and Witches, (b) Warlocks and Witches wishing tobecome Priests and Priestesses, (c) new members desiring the addresses ofRegional Agents, and (d) inquiries about local and regional newsletters.Instead of answering all these individually, we’ve decided to use the Hoof.First some comments concerning the II°: Basically there are two typesof individuals who express an interest in this degree - those who have defacto qualified for it and wish formal recognition of that fact, and those whohave not so qualified but wish to undertake tasks and/or tests that will earnthem the elevation.Where we got into trouble last issue was in inviting each new Satanistto assess himself. All Satanists [not excluding your worthy Editor] areunusually prone to self-magnification, i.e. conceit. Nothing wrong with thisper se; it’s a healthy vice which will goad you into increasingly ambitiouspursuits.But the degree system of the Church of Satan would make no sense atall unless the degrees are keyed to your skills and accomplishments as theyimpact the environment in which you have chosen to operate. This isextremely important.The adept Satanist is one who succeeds in translating his ideal image ofhimself into objective reality, not a starry-eyed introvert who recedesinto megalomaniac daydreams. Here we are diametrically opposed to“white light” occultism. If you think that you deserve recognition as a defacto II°, then we want evidence of the influence and expertise you havedeveloped. This may be in the form of professional standing, academicdegrees, military rank, awards received, offices held, media coverage,writings published, membership in exclusive groups, etc. Those Satanistsselected for the II° on our initiative are big enough shots so that we don’teven have to go out of our way to see their impact on society. Get thepicture?- 1312 -Now let us suppose that you’re a nice person who hasn’t done much ofanything yet, but who wants the Church of Satan to teach you “how todance”. Fine - as long as we both understand that. [Because we’ve had ourfill of novices whom we’ve nurtured, only to see them disavow and thenattack the hand that’s fed them.] The rules of the game are all there - in theSatanic Bible, Satanic Rituals, Compleat Witch, and this notablenewsletter.So the best way for you to proceed is to pull up your socks and begin tomake an impression on whatever sphere of influence you have chosen. Wenever said that it was a piece of cake - just that it can be done according tothe guidelines we have set forth. But you can’t sit around on your ass andexpect the world to come to you.Two years ago Dr. LaVey told you in Hoof #V-4 to go out and readNathaniel West’s A Cool Million. 75% of you didn’t do it. 20% did, but let itgo at that. The remaining 5% both read the book and put the book, theauthor, and the concepts to use … which is why they are riding the crest ofthe current 1890-1930 nostalgia boom, including the filming of West’s TheDay of the Locust.After you have taken a given ball and run with it, then come back andtalk to us about the II° - even if, for one reason or another, you were notsuccessful in attaining all you set out to. We are as interested inmethodology as in ends. And so is the Devil.If you think that you are de facto II° material but do not possessindependent evidence to substantiate same, we have provided a meanswhereby the Church will examine and evaluate you. This is in the form of anopen-ended, written examination. It is entirely new and bears noresemblance to the old, fixed-answer II° test used in Phases II & III. If youdesire to attempt it, we have set the processing fee at $20.Everything we have said concerning the II° goes for the III° in spades.Do not make the mistake of considering the III° as merely a sinistercounterpart to the philistine crew you see holding conventional religiousordinations. [They are ordained because, among other things, they can berelied upon not to exercise their grey matter!]It is technically possible for a Satanist to obtain the III° and higherwithout having passed through the II°. But, if you will think about it for amoment, it is highly improbable that a person qualified for Satanicordination would not have received prior evaluation and recognition as a II°. The exceptions, when they do occur, involve individuals of extraordinarymerit and potential who enter the sphere of influence of the Church of- 1313 -Satan at short notice. A glance through the pages of The Devil’s Avengerwill give you ample examples of this.Now for a word or two about Regional Agents: Phase III of the Church’sMaster Plan (June VI/1971 to August IX/1974) involved the rapiddecentralization of many of our administrative and operational functions tothe network of III° and II° officials that had been carefully organizedaround the planet during Phase II.What we failed to anticipate was that the Church membership wouldthen grow at such a swift rate that those ladies and gentlemen who hadvolunteered and been selected to serve as Regional Agents were, in a word,swamped. Worse than that, they were swamped for the wrong reason:People would join the Church, write to their Agents, squat back on theirhaunches, and await stimulation/entertainment. To put it mildly, ourAgents didn’t appreciate this.Under the current Phase IV, therefore, the Central Grotto does not putnew members in touch with Agents and/or Grotto Leaders until it sees atleast some evidence that the new member will contribute as much to sucha contact as he or she will extract from it. This, we feel, is not at allunreasonable. Just let us know what you’re doing, and we’ll initiate a linkupwhen/if appropriate.Local and regional newsletters were encouraged to beat the bandduring Phase III; thus many are doing quite nicely during Phase IV. Theonly drawback was that too many editors were content to do just that, i.e.collect and print reports of others’ magical operations to the exclusion oftheir own. Things began to get a bit ridiculous, as you can imagine, witheveryone sitting around waiting for somebody else to do something.Newsletters on the East Coast were reporting on the West Coast, andvirtue-versa. It would have been funny had it not drained so much energythat could and should have been employed positively.So once again in Phase IV we have yanked on the reins. We will put youin touch with one or more such publications when and if we think that youand it/them would both benefit.We are not trying to isolate you from what you may consider the“mainstream” of the Church. We are ensuring that, when you get there, youdon’t swim against the current, frustrating your own progress andimpeding that of others.If in five years you can honestly say that the Church of Satan hasn’trecognized, encouraged, and reinforced your positive efforts andaccomplishments, then you can get mad at us. But no one has yet, unless he- 1314 -presumed to pay us in pennies and get change in dollars. There is an oldaphorism: Facilis Descensus Averno. Don’t bet on it.BackscratchingEvidently there is some confusion about contributions of cash, realestate, etc. to the Church of Satan, because we receive many inquiries aboutthis.Here’s our position: The Church both accepts and welcomes all suchcontributions. The Church as an organization seeks no tax benefits from thegovernment, but we are fully incorporated as a religious institution. Thus,where your taxes are concerned, contributions to the Church qualify as alegitimate deduction. The same holds true for contributions of professionalservices.A cautionary note: This applies only in the case of contributions to theChurch as a whole, not to gifts to Grottos or specific Church officials.Therefore all checks and other contributions should be sent directly to theCentral Grotto and specifically identified as a contribution for tax purposes.Do not deduct such a contribution until you have received a receipt forsame from the Central Grotto.Check with your accountant to see how contributions affect your taxposition.Where does the “backscratching” come in? In other religious societiesyou can expect nothing but personal satisfaction and, possibly, taxadvantages from donations. We are different. If you go out of your way tohelp us [regardless of the tax benefits to you], you can expect the Church ofSatan to go out of its way to show appreciation.In each case we will tailor our response to its most appropriate form.You would be surprised at the variety of ways open to us. The point is thatwe do not forget our friends. And, when asked for attention, favors, orassistance, we are inclined to give priority to those who have given ofthemselves to us. Simple as that.- 1315 -Appendix 128: Letter, Diane LaVey to Michael AquinoJune 4, X/1975Dear Mike:My first question is: Why did you not voice any disagreement the nightwe sat for several hours discussing the new plans and reading you the essaywhich is identical to the one we sent for inclusion in the Hoof? Anton saidthat it was to be printed exact, except perhaps for a word changed here andthere to smooth it out. If your objections are as strong as they now appear,it seems inconceivable that they would not have occurred to you during theinitial discussion.Second, why do I get the impression that your latest letter was written,in part, for the eyes and ears of others besides ourselves. On a number ofpoints it raises, you know the facts are not as you have presented them. SoI feel your subjective reaction to the bluntness of the original draft for thelead essay has colored your feelings about many things, some of which aretotally unrelated. I was tempted to answer your didactic letter with a simpleone-line note: “If you can’t stand the heat …” (one of your favorite retorts).But I feel you deserve to know our reaction, considering the kinship thethree of us have had over the past six years.I will comment on each of the issues raised by your letter, but first Iwant to clarify that you certainly are not the “only one to tell you (Anton)things you don’t want to hear”. I have told him many, many things over thepast twelve years that he did not want to hear. (That’s called criticism.) Hehas often taken my criticism to heart and acted upon it - as he has yours -even when unsolicited. He has also often hotly rejected my criticism andsuggestions and done exactly what he thinks best. I respect him for bothresponses. His willingness to listen, then accept or reject as he sees fit, isindicative of the intelligence and strength that first attracted me to him andmakes me continue to love him more each year. I’ve always had anabhorrence for fraidy cats. I have stuck by him, regardless of whether Istrongly disagree with him at times, because I respect and believe in him.(That’s called loyalty.) And I am not the only one. We are not “yes men” (or“yes women”), because we do tell him when we disagree, but his word is thefinal one, like it or not.How many friends do you think strongly advised him not to form theChurch of Satan? Many. Their reasons? Too commercial. What if he hadlistened to their accusations of “selling out” or “cheapening” the Black Arts?- 1316 -Anton hates hypocrisy - and that, my dear Brother of the Night, is what theessay is geared to eradicate.The people who will establish the Church of Satan as a great and lastinginstitution are those who are realists! That - realism - is the philosophybehind Satanism. How do you know the present II° and III° people will feelbetrayed? In this case, I don’t think you can cite Lilith’s reaction, since -comment from you or not - she knows you pretty well, and facial expressioncan say what no words can. We credit them with more sophistication thanyou do. It is the very intelligence, dedication, and accomplishment (i.e. lifeexperience) which will enable them to comprehend the reasons for thealternate means of attaining higher degrees within the Church. Why notlet the II° and III° people speak for themselves?If a big shot is really a big shot and/or capable of offering the Church asizable contribution, he has had his fill of fancy dinners, honor guards, andfifteen-word honorary titles. And if our title didn’t mean anything to him,he wouldn’t be willing to pay for it. [The wealthy are notoriously moretightfisted than those less well endowed financially.] You know us betterthan to think we’re going to make some blowhard moron who doesn’t knowa Baphomet from a Mogen David, Third Degree. Chances are we wouldn’teven be placed in a position of talking with anyone like that long enough forthe subject to come up. We would feel either indifference or contempt,hence nothing could come of such an encounter. San Francisco tried tosweep Anton LaVey up in its big social scene a couple of years after theChurch was formed. She failed. Because he couldn’t stand being in the sameroom with most of the socialites he met. And he still can’t.As for prostituting ourselves, we all do it. It’s just a matter of semanticsand extent. From what you said about your stint at Merrill Lynch, I wouldthink you would be the first to recognize that prostitution is necessarysometimes, and that it is only when it becomes all-pervading that our livesgo sour. We don’t think we’re prostituting ourselves … anymore. WhenAnton had to pose for Devil-Man pictures and play court jester anytime thepress needed something to liven things up a bit, yes. But not any more. Ifyou regard us as such, then perhaps you can console yourself with the oldsaw, “This too will pass.”From the very beginning, Anton has placed very little importance ontitles. They were created because members demanded them. You know hehas more respect for certain I° people than for some III°. He has alwaysbeen direct with you on this point. Your own title was well earned andstands for exactly what it has been described as standing for. But you- 1317 -should know by now that it is the chemistry between Anton and certainindividuals that determines his respect (or lack of it) for them. Call it theroots of a personality cult if you wish, but I think if you consider the matterobjectively you will agree that no organization can survive without at leastsome element of hero-worship. Otherwise the role of leader would benonexistent in society. Matter of fact, I have correspondence from youabout a year ago saying that very thing. It was in reference to the AntonLaVey Fan Club business.I can’t believe you are as naïve as your statement “People won’t give acent to a church known to pawn its priesthood and initiatory degrees”makes you appear. What about the Shriners, other branches of Masonry,the Catholic Church and its WASP counterparts? They may not like toadmit it to themselves, but deep down they know that, if they don’t have thetime or inclination to work for positions of esteem in the organization, theycan cast their bread and get it back buttered.Do you truly understand the “Circus of Dr. LaVey”? You certainlydescribed it well in the . We always thought you knew the rigging, but yourlast letter shows signs of a loosening of the ropes. Apollonius spoke, andyou reacted like one of the rubes. We have never misled you. And this latestessay is just the same thing you’ve been hearing all along, with the shamstripped away. Our ideals are no different than they ever were. Methodschange from time to time, but the goals remain the same.Your comment about our living behind a protective fence was ill-timed,considering that just last night I was shot at through the front window at6114. It was only a pellet gun, but came through the window and shade at avelocity sufficient to embed itself in the ceiling diagonally above me. Inmeasuring the line of fire, had I been seated at my desk (from which I had asplit-second before stood up), I would have been in real trouble. You see,therefore, why this is a particularly touchy subject today, even though theperpetrators were apprehended six blocks away.Why can’t announced officials around the country take suchprecautions? Last I heard, building materials were still available. Andapartment dwellers have a hell of a lot more exterior protection. I think thatthe truth is they don’t need such precautions. Aside from an occasionalannoyance, like a nut call or irate letter or an isolated case of vandalismsuch as Lilith experienced in N.Y., I don’t think any of our officials have hadto take much abuse. I’m not going to give you a tale of woe, enumerating allthe incidents of vandalism and attempts at personal injury directed at ussince forming the Church [we’ve made our own bed]. But I do think it is- 1318 -absurd to compare our need for security precautions with that of ourofficials. Anyone bent on grand-scale violence is going to direct it at the topbanana; it’s attention-seeking rather than idealism which motivates thatsort of person.We were foolish in the beginning for announcing the exact location ofthe Church of Satan and permitting the address to be published. We havesince done everything possible to reverse the situation, but people want(need?) to believe that the C/S is still at 6114 California Street. That’s whythe fence. And that is why we spend as little time as we can in SanFrancisco. As you know, we have a little place on the Napa/Sonoma Countyborder, and we try to spend more hours there all the time. I love the OldDark House, which is why I could never completely pull out of it. But I lovelife and peace of mind too. Our Divert-a-Call machine has allowed us tosteal away to our hideout more often in the past year or so. Via the patchline, the phone can be answered there if no one authorized to pick up callsis at 6114.We have not the slightest difficulty seeing through superficial people,be they self-professed fans or otherwise. If we have no other talent, readingpeople is one we both have down to an art. So don’t worry about anyorganization of which Anton would be the central figure being made up ofnothing but superficial people. The only purpose Anton would have inallowing sycophants to sit at his feet would be that they’d be in a betterposition to kick in the teeth! Supportive personalities are not bootlickers.They are sounding boards, who feed back both encouragement and freshideas as an outgrowth of inspiration. They are supersensitive andintelligent, or else they would be mere sycophants and therefore useless.We know the difference. Which leads me to Tony.How dare anyone place you in a position of having to defend Anton’s“gift” [no gift - it was earned] of the IV° to Tony? Who are they to setthemselves up as judges of the worth of a man whom they either don’t knowor barely know? Have they seen any of his writings or artwork, or heard anyof his profound observations? Hell, no! If Tony wanted to, he could beanother Eric Hoffer or Jimmy Breslin. And that’s no exaggeration. He’sroughhewn, yes, but his acumen far exceeds 95% of our members’, officialsincluded. Since when are verbal eloquence and polished bearing a measureof intelligence? I know plenty of vacuous speechmakers and malemannequins who might as well be androids for all the original thoughtsthey come up with.- 1319 -Just don’t let us know who considers Tony’s blue Baphomet a “slap inthe face” if you care for their well-being. And you speak of dedication! Our“dedicated field members and officials” don’t know the meaning of theword, compared to Tony. He has gone far beyond the call of duty so manytimes I can’t recall them all. Anyone with half a brain should be able todiscern that Tony is a great deal more than a “family chauffeur”. [For therecord, he seldom drives for “the family”. He is Anton’s driver, and mineon occasion.] Tony stands as a shining example of the sort of person youdescribe as being entitled to the higher degrees. True, he doesn’t typeletters [although he can type] or conduct Grotto activities. But neither is hea celebrity or moneybags. He is not a nebbish either. For six years he hasbeen Anton’s [and my] most constant personal aide and companion. Andsince Anton isn’t gay and we don’t go in for kinky group sex, we must havevalid reasons for our regard for Tony. The audacity of anyone questioningthem! Do us a favor: Don’t defend Tony, because he doesn’t need it.Now to Lilith’s reaction. I am, incidentally, sending her a copy of thisletter along with your original, since you have involved her in the matter. Itwas our understanding that the material slated for the Hoof was to remainconfidential until in its final form. That way any possible rough spots thatmight tend to mislead would be ironed out before anyone read it. But that’sokay; I know you and Lilith are very close, and it’s like Anton readingsomething to me.As I said, I truly feel that your attitude has colored Lilith’s, and that thereaction you anticipated from her [and others] influenced your response.Be that true or false, I am nevertheless quite surprised at Lilith’s feelings.Ask Lilith about how she reveled in the role of disciplinarian for theLilith Grotto and, literally, had a gent or two sitting at her feet duringmeetings. She and Lana used to giggle over this. Priestess Lilith was giventhe III° because she was one of the Compleatest Witches we hadencountered within the Church. She ruled with an iron hand, and extractedassistance and donations from her Grotto members as few others could.And they felt nothing but gratitude toward her. The only rumblings thatever occurred were as a result of jealousy on the part of one member overher attentions to another. But she always could regain her balance. Theyjumped through hoops for her. She milked those who allowed themselves tobe milked, and maintained respect for those who didn’t but were supportiveof her policies. She was a Hellion par excellence. And the East Coast is thepoorer for her leaving.- 1320 -Lilith had the spark it took to keep the Flames burning brightly. So youcan see why I find it difficult to picture her breaking down after readingsomething that was a mere amplification of her own modus operandi. But ifyou say so.Since you find this issue of the Hoof too abrasive to your sensibilities, itwill go out from here. Some of your text will be retained, but don’t worryabout having to take responsibility for the lead essay. Rex Kincaid’s bylinewill be on it.You have made it clear that you find the current elucidation of policyrepugnant. Now we will give the others an opportunity to make theirfeelings known, pro or con. Any reaction the forthcoming Hoof elicits mustbe spontaneous. Therefore please contain your feelings as you have thusfar.Rege Satanas!/s/ DianeDiane LaVey- 1321 -Appendix 129: Letter, Michael Aquino toAnton & Diane LaVeyJune 10, X/1975Dear Diane and Dr. LaVey,This is in answer to your letter of June fourth.During our meeting in San Francisco I voiced no objections to yourproposed Hoof article for three reasons:(1) It was read to me only once and in excerpts, and I did not have theopportunity to examine the text for myself.(2) I was told it was the gist of an article, and that I would subsequentlybe able to, as you put it, smooth it out. [That is precisely what I attemptedto do in my “Bon Chat” and “Backscratching” substitute articles, because Idid not think that it was your intention to sell the degrees.](3) I did not come to 6114 expecting to hear that, and I would havedoubted my own hearing had I understood it from the conversation.My letter of May 31 was written for Anton Szandor LaVey alone. If itseems overly formal in tone, it is perhaps because it was extremely painfulfor me to write. When I bring up issues as serious as those in the letter, I tryto be as precise in what I say as possible. As for the contents, the facts werethen and are now exactly as I presented them. Had I been able to place anyother interpretation on them, I would have done so.That Hoof article of yours is not geared to eradicate hypocrisy, butrather to institute it as official policy of the Church of Satan.Of course Satanists are realists. But to be realistic about life does notmean than one must sacrifice a code of personal integrity. If indeed AntonLaVey once created the degree system without placing importance upon it,it seems that he has changed his mind after seeing that system built intosomething both important and desirable by those Satanists who have usedit to symbolize their standards of integrity and achievement. Evidently ithas become so important and desirable that you are determined to sell it,in spite of my offer to pursue alternate and honorable methods offundraising for the Church.To argue that you would not sell a degree to anyone not otherwiseworthy to hold it is a self-contradictory statement. Any person whoseunderstanding of the Satanic II° or III° is such that he feels justified inassuming same by the mere writing of a check may not be a “blowhardmoron”. But he would be unprincipled, contemptuous of the ideals of- 1322 -others, and unconvinced that he could attain the same degree throughhonest effort on his own part.As for your disavowal of the social limelight, methinks you protest toomuch. You have both gloried in it, as the constant stream of personalpublicity over the past ten years evidences. I find no fault with this andnever said that I did. Since you seemed pleased and flattered by it, I havefelt all the more happy for you.No, we do not all prostitute ourselves. When a person works for aliving, he places his time and energy at the disposal of someone who iswilling to pay him for doing so. But no one need undertake a line of workthat he finds ethically unacceptable. I reject your insinuation that Icompromised my own ethics by becoming a Merrill Lynch executive. Thestock market is dispassionate towards those who participate in it, but noone is forced to do so. And I have never accepted a client whom I eithermisled or failed to inform of all applicable risks.You are right in saying that no organization can prosper without someelement of hero-worship. A strong and effective leader is always admired.But that does not justify the replacement of impersonal standards of ethicsby the leader’s whims, no matter how infallible he may believe himself tobe.Because other churches and religious societies may pawn theirprinciples is no excuse for the Church of Satan doing so. In fact this isexactly why it should not do so. The Church of Satan was intended to take astand against hypocrisy, not join in it.If this Hoof essay of yours is “the same thing I’ve been hearing all alongwith the sham stripped away”, then apparently I’ve not seen through thatsham for the past six years. It is rather inconsistent for you to precede astatement like that with a comment that you have never misled me.I have never minimized the risk to your family and yourselves. As youwell know, I have constantly reminded others of this, particularly officialsof the Church who have thought to enjoy the glamor of their positions whileremaining safely away from public scrutiny. But this in no way permits youto downplay the importance of the risk your field officials have assumed.Hard though you may find this to believe, most don’t care that much aboutbecoming celebrities, nor did they aspire to their offices with the intentionof cashing in on them beyond the modest and appropriate guidelines setforth in the Articles of Protocol.The social risk that any Satanist - to say nothing of ordained officials -undertakes is far out of proportion to any glamor he may gain in the- 1323 -community. You are well aware of the many Satanists who have sufferedostracism, job discrimination, family harassment, threats of injury, andpersonal property damage. The effects have often been felt by spouses andchildren as well. Yet the two of you have never been resented or blamed forit, because the risks were willingly undertaken as a vote of confidence inyou. Far from considering it “absurd” for me to bring this up, you shouldnever cease to remember and appreciate it. I am deeply ashamed for youthat you do not have the grace to do so.Nor is it true that the overt violence will be directed only at the “topbanana”. If a Satanist has been effective in making his beliefs known andhis influence felt in any local community, that person will be the onetargeted. This too you know well from past case histories.How “dare” Satanic Priests and Priestesses ask me questions? And Ishould expect your vengeance to fall upon them should I reveal theirnames?Any person whom I accept as a student or recognize as a fellow Satanistmay ask me any question whatsoever. And I will answer honestly, if Ibelieve his curiosity genuine and his motives pure. If you confer the IV° ona person who, according to your own statement, does not possess theoutward attributes of a Magister Templi, and he himself has not moved todemonstrate his worth to other Satanists with whom he comes into contact,how can you expect honest doubts not to occur?Your field officials hold their degrees because of skills andaccomplishments which are evident throughout the Church. In my opiniona III° or IV° official who neither accepts students nor seeks contact withfellow officials does not know the meaning of a true priesthood per se.I have not defended Tony on the grounds of being able to explain his IV° credentials, because I know nothing of his background. Rather I have saidthat Anton LaVey would not have conferred the degree had it not beenmerited. On the whole, questioners have accepted this, but it is anargument based entirely on faith. Since Satanists by their very nature areinclined to accept nothing on faith that reason argues against, there hasbeen a certain gritting of teeth. I do not consider this evidence of weaknesson their part, but rather of the store they set by the Satanic Bible’sadmonition to “question all things”.For you to say that the judgment of Priestess Lilith was colored by herdesire to “please” me, and to say that she ever “milked” her friends andfollowers in the Lilith Grotto according to the same modus operandi thatyou now seek to institute is not only untrue, it is thoroughly disgusting.- 1324 -Finally there is the matter of your instructions to me to keep silent onthis entire matter, allowing the policy to go out in the Hoof under another’sbyline. You do not understand. It is not who says it that makes a difference.It is the fact that it is said at all as a policy of the Church of Satan. Evenmore than that, it is the fact that Anton Szandor LaVey was the one whothought it up. At this point, even if you now reword the final article in anattempt to restore some of that “sham” you were talking about, it makes nodifference at all.Yes, we will give our II° and III° officials a chance to make theirfeelings known. And yes, we will let them speak for themselves. But notsimply on the basis of whatever you now allow the May-June Hoof tocontain. Instead they are going to know the entire story, in your words aswell as in mine.I have sent copies of the enclosed packet of correspondence to all IV°,III°, and II° Satanists who have had sufficient contact with me over the pastyears to trust the integrity of any organization I endorse. 905 Also enclosed isa copy of the cover letter I am sending to each of them. 906It has now been almost four years since I accepted the Editorship of theCloven Hoof, and you have told me that I am widely - and correctly - knownto be the author of all the unsigned material in that newsletter. As Editor Ihave a personal responsibility to all Satanists who have received the Hoofand trusted in its contents. Therefore I also enclose a letter which I havesent to all members of the Church on the Hoof mailing list. 907 It has notbeen sent to nonmember subscribers, honorary membership celebrities, orpersonal friends and relatives of yours who are on the list.I am disappointed with you beyond expression. Not because you choseto answer my last appeal to you in a way that was rude and contemptuous.Not even because, under the guise of friendship, you have abused andexploited my trust in you. But because you have now acted to deliberatelydestroy a great institution that would have revolutionized human905 Anton LaVey’s draft lead article, May 20, X/1975.

You founded it, and more than the rest of us you have seen it grow,enduring trial after trial and always emerging stronger and more noble. Noone has asked you to sacrifice more of yourselves for it. We have takenpride in building upon the base you forged, raising your Church of Satan byour sweat and always thinking of you while doing so. And now, throughsome insanity, you have deliberately chosen to deal a deathblow to thiswonderful thing - something no one on this world but you could have done.What perverse logic has so distorted your judgment? I am sorry for you, butI cannot excuse you.I reaffirm my degree as Magister Templi, and I reaffirm the degrees ofall those who have won them and honored them according to the standardsSatan himself has upheld since the dawn of human civilization. Since you -Satan’s High Priest and High Priestess - have presumed to destroy thesestandards and replace the true Church of Satan with a “Church of Anton”,the Infernal Mandate is hereby withdrawn from the organization known asthe “Church of Satan, Inc.” and you are no longer empowered to executeyour offices. The degrees you scorn are no longer yours to administer, butshall be safeguarded according to the Will of Satan. “Whenever, therefore, alie has built unto itself a throne, let it be assailed without pity and withoutregret.”Until this time the Church of Satan has rightly affirmed its legitimacy,and those who contest that will find no ally in me. I shall never forget thegreatness of its legacy or the incomparable debt all Satanists owe to itsfounder. And, personally, I shall never cease to love the two of you as gentleand sensitive people whose only fault, perhaps, was in falling victim topressures no human being should be expected to endure for long. In time Ihope you may understand this, and that then you will not think ill of me forwhat I now do. For so I am bound by my sacred oath to Satan.Rege Satanas!/s/ Michael A.

It is followed by my owndraft of the first two pages of that issue, which I had submitted as areplacement for the LaVey text.This in turn is followed by a series of subsequent letters between theLaVeys and myself. I think they will be self-explanatory.I do this to fulfill my oath to Satan and my obligation to you. I have noobjection to your discussing this material among one another if you desireto do so. Whether you discuss it with the LaVeys is entirely your decision.If you believe that I have acted in accordance with the true Will of OurLord Satan, I will await your word to that effect.Rege Satanas!/s/ Michael A. Aquino- 1328 -- 1329 -Appendix 131: Letter to the Church Membership- from Michael A. Aquino IV°June 10, X/1975[See Appendix #129]To all members of the Church of Satan:Since November of the year VI/1971 I have had the privilege ofspeaking with you as Editor of the Cloven Hoof and author of all unsignedmaterial appearing in that publication.Over my objections an article is scheduled to appear in the May-JuneX/1975 Hoof announcing that financial and material contributions to theCentral Grotto will henceforth be considered “qualification for elevation tothe II° and III°”. Whether the article will in fact appear after this letter ofmine becomes known is open to question. But the decision has been made.It is my firm conviction that the Satanic degrees cannot and should notbe sold, no matter how helpful the cash contribution involved may be to theChurch of Satan. Since the founding of the Church, elevation to all of thedegrees has been only through personal intelligence, dedication, andaccomplishment. I believe those to be the proper criteria.Effective prior to the May-June issue, I resign the Editorship of theCloven Hoof. I further sever my connections with the Church of Satan as anorganization, since it no longer carries the true sanction of the Prince ofDarkness.If you desire to communicate with me, I may be reached at the aboveaddress, which now becomes a non-Church of Satan address.Thank you, and my best wishes to all of you. Diabolus Vobiscum.Rege Satanas!Michael A. AquinoMagister Templi IV°- 1330 -- 1331 -Appendix 132: Letter, Lilith Sinclair to Anton & DianeLaVeyJune 13, X/1975Dear Dr. LaVey and Diane,I am utterly appalled and offended by the proposed “selling” of the II°and III°; and that it is even being contemplated is an inconceivable affrontto all of us who have earned them according to the standards set forth inthe Articles of Protocol! They are granted by the Dark Lord Himself, andare not a commodity to be bought by whoever has the right amount of cash,nor are they to be bartered.I am truly sorry you have made this decision and am deeplydisappointed, for you have always been the living embodiment of theprinciples and integrity of the Church of Satan, the only organization thatdared to “practice what it preaches” in a hypocrisy-laden world.In reference to your remarks concerning field officials, I cannot believethat you hold us in so little regard. We have gladly and willingly putourselves and our families on the line for you both, and for the principlesand philosophy you espoused. It is a most bitter pill to swallow that ourdedication and loyalty are apparently not reciprocated, and worse yet arethe objects of your contempt. If I had not seen the correspondence with myown eyes, I should never have believed this betrayal!You say you are surprised by my tears, since my own methods are thesame. I have never “milked” nor betrayed anyone in the Lilith Grotto orthe Church of Satan. Contributions were given voluntarily to the Grottokitty, and all gifts to the Grotto remained there when I left. I do not weepfor myself, but for the death of my respect for you.I violently resent the insinuation that my reaction is based on mycloseness with Magister Aquino and a desire to “please” him. My feelingsfor him have not rendered me blind and deaf, nor devoid of judgment. I amnot a fool, nor am I a parrot. I have always made my own evaluations anddecisions. The reactions and conclusions I have reached are entirely myown, and not the result of any influence on Magister Aquino’s part. He hasfar more integrity and honor than you credit him with, and more respect formy intelligence than to do anything so repugnant.My expertise as a Compleat Witch is a source of great pride to me, butit is by no means my only claim to the III°. Intelligence, integrity, tenacity,- 1332 -and plain guts are an integral part of my office as a Priestess of Mendes, aswell as my identity as an individual.While I shall always love you both, I can no longer support anorganization that has betrayed its own standards and made a mockery of itsteachings. I therefore resign from the Church of Satan, Inc. I do not resignmy office as a Priestess of Mendes, for this was granted me by the Prince ofDarkness Himself, according to the standards and ethics He demands, andI further reaffirm my Oath and allegiance to Him.For me to act in any other manner would be a negation and betrayal ofall that I have believed in and upheld for the past five years, the ultimatehypocrisy.Rege Satanas!Lilith SinclairPriestess of Mendes III°- 1333 -Appendix 133: Letter, Ronald K. Barrett to Anton LaVeyJune 17, X/1975Dear Dr. LaVey,It has become necessary for me to make a decision which was actuallymade the day I applied for membership in the Church of Satan. I believenow, as I did then, in the philosophy of Satanism as set down in writing byyou. I strongly believe that the principles of the Satanic Bible are applicableto all positions and degrees of the Church of Satan, be it Apprentice or HighPriest.Having read the packet of correspondence between yourself, Diane,and Magister Aquino, I am forced to comment - especially on items I knowto be inaccurate.The comments from Diane concerning Priestess Lilith Sinclair are falseand degrading, not only to Priestess Lilith but to the entirety of the LilithGrotto. I was there! Priestess Lilith was “given” nothing. She proved thatshe is a Priestess, and exercised that authority. The only “discipline” was ademand of respect for herself as a Satanist and for her title as determinedby Church protocol. The grovelers didn’t last long - lest we forget certainexpulsions. If anyone sat at her feet, it was more than likely to look up herskirt. The “gratitude” we felt toward her was not unlike the gratitude we felttoward you! Yes, she is a compleat witch; and that includes beingresponsible, efficient, sensitive, and personable.The Grotto was push and pull, and I never saw respect due to any of usfrom her left unpaid - a very rare quality in leaders of any kind ormagnitude. I can’t help but see Diane’s picture of Priestess Lilith as similarto your picture of a psychic vampire, and that is not a satisfactorydescription. To me it also resembles petty schoolgirl jealousy and is mostunworthy of a High Priestess.It also occurs to me that you would have been quite displeased withsuch low-life, dog-kicked, jumping, milk-sot Satanists as you evidentlybelieved us to be. Yet you stated that we were among the “model” Grottos inthe Church. There is a strange inconsistency here between practice andpreaching. Mutual respect and responsibility were two of Priestess Lilith’smost stressed “policies”, and we assumed - perhaps mistakenly - that thesewere policies throughout the Church of Satan. Diane’s comments couldliterally be carved above the door of a women’s lib hall of fame, to themutual disgust of Priestess Lilith and the Lilith Grotto (of which I was- 1334 -proudly and uncastratedly a member). I find the rest of Diane’s letterwithout taste and/or dignity.My title of Warlock, as yours of High Priest, is a title of being, not anoffice bought or bartered for like most political offices and stations withinwhite-light religious/occult flocks. Are the words on my elevationdocument, and especially the last paragraph - “having passed before theCouncil of Nine, Order of the Trapezoid, by all the powers of Hell, so it isdone” - only a joke, a lie, or bait for higher tithes and offerings? How likeRome, Children of God, the Processians, the Masons, Church of UniversalLife, etc. it is all beginning to sound. Hypocrisy is hypocrisy; it just seemstoglow brighter in black light than in white light.I maintain my respect for that which you have accomplished, for thatwhich you have been, and for the Church of Satan that once was; but now Ifind that we are of no further use to each other. I feel that your attempt tosell out or barter the Satanic potential has degenerated our magnificentuniqueness into “useless lumber and wreckage”. I hope that you will beremembered for what you built and not for how you destroyed it.As I am a seeker of truth and wisdom, and since “belief in one falseprinciple is the beginning of all unwisdom”, and after careful consideration,I must painfully resign from the Church of Satan, Inc. Perhaps in time youwill take a profound pride in having authored a philosophy so perfect thatby its nature it is unable to be corrupted or destroyed. Perhaps then also,you will be proud of me for having made this decision.Rege Satanas!Ronald K. BarrettWarlock II°- 1335 -Appendix 134: Letter, Margaret Wendall toAnton & Diane LaVeyJune 20, X/1975Dear Dr. and Mrs. LaVey:You cannot imagine how shocked and dismayed I was to learn of theproposed sale of the degrees of the Church of Satan, Inc. I’ve alwaysremembered and cherished the evening spent with you in which I was giventhe examination for III°. I felt it was an honor to be asked personally to takethe examination, and when the degree was bestowed upon me, I felt it hadbeen earned. I’ve always held the trust bestowed on me, and I’ve done mybest to uphold the honor and dignity of the Church of Satan. I’ve workedhard in the III°, and feel it is a betrayal of this time and energy [andmoney!] to sell the degree to someone who couldn’t otherwise “pass thetest”.I have only one question to ask about this: How long had the Church ofSatan, Inc. been selling its degrees before we learned of it? The reason forthis question shall become apparent in the following paragraphs.Despite page #5, paragraph #1 of the Articles of Protocol - (“The GrottoLeader, Regional Agent, or aspiring official also acts as mediator betweenthe members of his group and the Central Grotto. He will correspond withhis members or meet with them personally to discuss matters of mutualinterest. He will answer questions within the scope of his personalexpertise. Any developments about which he is uncertain should be referredto the Central Grotto in his monthly report.”) - the Central Grotto has noteven acknowledged correspondence from me for over a year; of course, noquestions have been answered.Members SZZ-697 and WZZ-593, whose memberships expired inMarch, have not received their renewal cards yet. Member WZZ-593 hassent me money and has asked me to place another renewal application forhim. My own membership took over eight weeks and a letter to MagisterAquino last fall to process.I’ve completely stopped “bothering” the Central Grotto staff withmembers’ questions that I cannot answer, because I know I will neverreceive an answer. There is no excuse for this!Your proposed lead article for the May-June Cloven Hoof is in directcontradiction to the last issue, and to what members have been told by theCentral Grotto regarding elevation to the II°. What is the truth? There is a- 1336 -real credibility gap here, and I doubt there is much you or the CentralGrotto staff could do now to correct the situation.Having I° and II° members ask me questions about policies I had neverheard of, and for which I knew I could not get an answer from the CentralGrotto, has been not only frustrating but often an embarrassment to me -and to other Priests and Regional Agents I know.The answer for this has been made quite apparent in the letter fromLady Diane to Magister Aquino, in which she so cavalierly treats theproblems we who work in the “field” face every day. At first I could hardlybelieve they were her words, but there has been ample time for a denial ifthey aren’t. There has been time for a rebuttal of Magister Aquino’s chargesas well. I doubt one will be forthcoming.The cloak of “secrecy” surrounding the Church of Satan has now beenextended even to members.I’d be less than honest if I didn’t say I saw the “break” coming. The newPhase - “Dispersion” - was coldly calculated to drive members apart.“Dispersion” was destined to destroy the Church of Satan, Inc. Humans aresocial animals. Members need contact with other members, if only to sitover coffee and talk with someone who believes as they do. It is healthy todo this, and it is unhealthy not to! And if it has been difficult to be aPriestess with no “parish”, how much more difficult has it been for newmembers to have no contact within the Church to answer the questions allnew members have, and to help develop hidden talents? I often wonderhow many potentially excellent magicians we have lost because of the no-contact policy.I’ve been in the Church of Satan, Inc. for almost five years, and I’vewatched the slow disintegration of what the Church stood for when I wasadmitted to membership at the Central Grotto. The disintegration hasapparently come from the “top”, for it hasn’t come from the membersthemselves.The sale of degrees and the attitude you have expressed toward me andeveryone else who has worked for the success of the Church of Satan, Inc.are not the only reasons for this letter, but they could be called the laststraw. I thought the Church of Satan, Inc. had more respect for itsmembers, and these two incidents have made a mockery of my life for atleast the past three years, if not all five.To say that I regret having to make a decision whether to remain in theChurch of Satan would be an understatement. The actual decision has beenin the making for about six months, and would have been delayed, if not- 1337 -prevented, if you had presented a rebuttal against the charges maderecently by Magister Aquino. By not answering them you have onlywidened the credibility gap I have mentioned earlier in this letter.It is still no easy thing to resign from something that has meant somuch to me for so long. I reaffirm my belief in the principles of Satanism asfound in the Satanic Bible and the Satanic Rituals, because I still believethat the truth of Satanism is contained in them. It is no longer contained inthe Church of Satan, Inc., and I now join with Magister Aquino inwithdrawing the Infernal Mandate from this organization.For all the reasons in this letter, I resign membership in the Church ofSatan, Inc. I do not resign as Priestess of Mendes, because it was bestowedupon me by the Powers of Darkness themselves and remains a veryessential part of my being.Sincerely,Margaret A. WendallPriestess of Mendes III°- 1338 -- 1339 -Appendix 135: Letter, L. Dale Seago to Anton LaVeyJune 12, X/1975Dear Dr. LaVey:I cannot tell you how shocked and horrified I was to learn of yourintention to offer the degrees of the Church of Satan for sale. ThePriesthood, to me, is a sacred charge and trust committed to me by thePrince of Darkness himself. Being a Priest of Mendes is not something I do;it is - irrevocably - what I am. The essence of Satanism, as I see it, is theevolution of man into divinity, the creation of a super-being and a super-race. My dedication to this ideal has led me through a number oftribulations which I will not enumerate here, as you have been informed ofthem. I accepted them willingly as the consequences of my ethicaldecisions.I believed that in a phony world there had arisen one unique institutionwhich formed an ultimate bastion against hypocrisy, an organizationsanctioned and supported by Satan himself - not a “diploma mill for paperpriests”. I believed that it was headed by a man of profound andunparalleled insight and unshakable principles and conviction.If the degrees of the Church of Satan are to be no longer the measure ofan individual but baubles to be bought and sold, or tossed as sops tosycophants as marks of personal favor, then the Church of Satan hasdegenerated into the Church of Anton LaVey; and being a Priest in it isabout as meaningful as being a Shriner in Masonry or an Operating Thetanin Scientology.Why not go ahead and create a few additional degrees while you’re atit? After all, everyone else does it, and money seems to be the name of thegame now rather than integrity. A person who purchases a black belt from aspurious karate school is not a martial artist simply because a piece ofpaper says he is, or because he wears the belt. Nor is a scrap of paper able toconfer an initiatory degree. The degrees of the Church of Satan are going tobecome mere receipts for contributions to your coffers.If you intend to replace individuals with bank accounts, if you valuededication to your own person above commitment to the principles andphilosophy of Satanism and to Our Lord Satan himself, then I can no longersupport you or the organization you lead.Even if you were to renounce your intention of selling the degrees, itwould be too late. The damage has been done by the fact that you ever- 1340 -made such a decision in the first place, for my loyalty, trust, and confidencein you have been irreparably shattered. I cannot help feeling that in themoment that decision was made, the Infernal Mandate of the HighPriesthood of Satan passed from you.It is therefore with inexpressible pain and regret that I hereby resignmy membership in the Church of Satan.Rege Satanas!L. Dale Seago- 1341 -Appendix 136: Letter, Robert Ethel to Anton LaVeyJune 13, X/1975Dear Dr. LaVey:I have been a member of the Church of Satan for five years. During thistime I have watched it grow into an important and influential organizationof the highest standards. Also during this time I have progressed to thePriesthood of Mendes - which I like to think was accomplished by mypersonal ability as both a greater and lesser magician. All of which bringsme to this: Yesterday I received a packet of material from Michael Aquino.It came as quite a shock, and I would like to make some comments on itscontents.True, realists will make the Church great, but the idea that realismequals greatness, intelligence, integrity, and ability holds no water. One canbe a realist and understand that the majority of the populace are no betterthan sheep waiting to be fleeced. This fleecing can be undertaken on agrand and intelligent scale, filled with beautiful words and fantasticphilosophy and signifying nothing! The very idea of fleecing indicates thatsomething is lacking in the integrity department. Realism alone cannot andwill not make the Church great. It must be coupled with intelligence,integrity, and ability. These are exactly what will be lost if we sell ourdegrees!The world is full of people with enough wealth to make sizablecontributions to the Church of Satan. While the very wealthy may benotoriously tightfisted, there are many to whom the wealth means verylittle, either because they did not earn it or because they have become jadedby it. It follows that making a contribution to the Church would meanequally little, especially over a period of time. What value can be set on theII° or III°? To me one that even Howard Hughes couldn’t pay.While I do not doubt the fact that both you and Mrs. LaVey areexcellent judges of people, I cannot take solace in it. I have no quarrel withTony [I’m sorry, but I do not know his last name] holding the IV°. As Mrs.LaVey said in her letter to Magister Aquino of June 4, I am sure that heearned it. To be completely honest, I had never heard of him untilyesterday.My point is, however, material contributions to the Church cannot andshould not be criteria for elevation. Wealth does not equal ability, andability can be proved or disproved only over a period of time.- 1342 -I agree with Magister Aquino’s idea of setting up a system of honorarydegrees. After all, a person who makes substantial contributions to a lawschool and receives an honorary doctorate in return cannot take the barand practice law. Our medical profession would be in sad shape if anyonewho gave enough money could practice medicine. How about if the JointChiefs of Staff consisted of honorary generals? I think that if we are going to“sell” degrees, let’s do it on an honorary basis, giving the recipient no voicein the functioning of the Church. I do not find the idea of having to dealwith a Priest of Mendes who bought his degree at all appealing. It puts usback in the same ditch with the diploma mills and the “send us a buck andwe’ll make you a priest” churches. The egos (that all-important aspect ofSatan) of those who have earned their degrees stand to suffer, and alongwith them the Church of Satan! Speaking personally and as a Priest ofMendes, I feel that we are on the verge of making a great mistake.Be it herewith known that I sever all relations with the Church of Satan,Inc., located at 6114 California Street, San Francisco, California, and with amailing address at Post Office Box 7633, San Francisco, California 94120,for the reason that it no longer carries the sanction of the Prince ofDarkness.It is my conviction that the Satanic degrees cannot be sold, no matterwhat the price. The Church of Satan in so doing has betrayed the InfernalMandate.Also be it known that I reaffirm my standing as a Priest of Satan, andthat I shall continue to work in His best interests on this Earth.Rege Satanas!Robert EthelPriest of Mendes III°- 1343 -Appendix 137: Letter, Jinni Bast to Anton LaVeyJune 16, X/1975Dear Dr. LaVey:You will recall that about a year ago there was some discussion about“degrees for sale”. At that time most of the members with whom I came incontact were against this happening for various reasons.It has now come to my attention that “degrees for sale” is anestablished policy of the Church of Satan, and after very much thought Ihave decided to sever myself from the Church of Satan. I don’t believe apaid-for degree can do anything for anyone. An individual will reach certainheights on his own, with or without paid-for degrees.With this paid-for-degree business you remind me too much of theCatholic Church from which I’ve completely and irrevocably severed myself.I hereby resign from the Church of Satan.Rege Satanas!Jinni BastWitch II°- 1344 -- 1345 -Appendix 138: Letter, Robert Brink to Anton LaVeyJune 17, X/1975Dear Dr. LaVey:I, Robert G.

I can only be honestwith myself as a Satanist.Considering the principles of the Satanic Bible, I cannot allow myself tobe part of an organization that sells its degrees. I would like to earn mydegrees because I worked hard to do so, not because I offer a gift of somekind expecting elevation.What is the sense of having a degree or title if you cannot magically andintellectually know what is involved - and back it up?Rege Satanas!Robert G.

NortonWarlock II°- 1348 -- 1349 -Appendix 140: Letter, Ricco Zappitelli to Anton LaVeyJune 25, X/1975Dear Dr. LaVey:I have been a member of the Church of Satan for only a short while andstrongly believe in the Satanic Bible and its concepts.At first I could not believe what you were not only suggesting butordering Magister Aquino to include in the Cloven Hoof - especially theitem on how to “please the boss”. I find it difficult to believe that you arethesame man who wrote the Satanic Bible, for this situation is clearly theChristian hypocrisy of “Do as I say, not as I do.” At first I felt sad anddisillusioned at what has occurred; then I became angry; and now I act withlogic and in the knowledge of what is good for me.I cannot with integrity be part of any organization that shuns its ownideals and honor, and sells its degrees. Degrees can only be given inrecognition of what one already is or has earned, if given rightly. I find anyother system of elevation - and group that practices any other system -repugnant, pseudo, and a waste of time.I find the “official” attitude toward certain Church officials an affront tome and despicable. That same attitude has most certainly reduced yourstature in the eyes of many Satanists, including myself. How dare you actwith such pomposity, especially to Satanists, or do you really believeyourself to be the Black Pope and infallible? Aren’t you the same man whoonce wrote: “He that saith ‘thou shalt’ to me is my mortal foe!”?I hereby proclaim myself a Satanist and resign from the Church ofSatan, Inc.

Your policyregarding the sale of degrees has belittled the essence of those degrees andmade them invalid within the organization of the Church of Satan.Colleen and I have always maintained that our positions as II°s carrythe endorsement of Satan and are sustained through His Infernal Presence.Even though the sale of degrees would not affect the knowledge, power, andsuccess which we have attained, it would make the progress of Satanicknowledge within the Church less important and result in a money gameand stagnation.The damage to the organization and its Satanic direction has alreadybeen done by your own policy.For what it’s worth, Colleen and I will always regard Anton SzandorLaVey, Magus of the Age of Satan, with deep respect for declaring the trueWord of Satan and establishing an Order which upheld His philosophiesand direction. We cannot, however, remain in this organization which hasdecided to sell the very degrees which contained His Infernal Wisdom.It is with great pain and regret that Colleen and I hereby terminate ourmemberships in the Church of Satan.Thomas Scott Huddleston II°Colleen Geske Huddleston II°- 1352 -- 1353 -Appendix 142: “Hoisted by His Own Patois”- by Anton Szandor LaVeyOrder of the TrapezoidChurch of Satan20 June X/1975To: The recipients of Michael Aquino’s resignation packetHOISTED BY HIS OWN PATOISAs you know, Michael Aquino has severed his connection with theChurch of Satan. I have been increasingly aware that Mr. Aquino hasbecome too large for his trousers, and have attempted to subdue him astactfully as possible. In his recent packet to you, on page 2 of his letter ofJune 10, paragraph 3, he reproaches authoritarian whim and belief ofinfallibility. Two pages later, on page 4, paragraph 3, he himself assumesnot only human infallibility, but spiritual and supernatural as well. He hasrelieved me of an “Infernal Mandate” which I have never claimed to hold.I have freely admitted that I assumed my office of High Priest becauseat the time there was no one else who did. The titles “Infernal Empire”,“Exarch of Hell”, etc. are symbolic, not literal.Magic is a way of life, not a divine right uniquely assumed by Mr.Aquino, or myself either. Let those who can, do. The Church of Satan is anorganization dedicated to rational self-interest, indulgence, and aglorification of material and carnal elements. I held these beliefs in thebeginning as I do now. If others reinterpret my organization andphilosophy into a fundamental kind of supernaturalism, it stems from theirneeds to do so.The infallible Mr. Aquino has, by virtue of “personal integrity”, paperpomposity, and cant, tried to mislead you in accordance with his ownrigidly fixed moral code. He has exalted himself as the Great White Hope ofSatanism, which seems to me a contradiction in terms. In wishing to saveyou from my evil and treacherous machinations, he forgets that saviors areno longer much in demand, especially among Satanists. I don’t wish to saveanyone from anything and have said so in the Satanic Bible. Let eachperson be his or her own redeemer.Judging from initial response to Mr. Aquino’s packet, the vast majorityof recipients have reaffirmed their alliance with the Church of Satan.- 1354 -Response has been most gratifying and will not be forgotten. His behaviorhas been described by communicants as: “petty”, “priggish”, “raging”,“puritanical”, “bitchy”, “disgusting”, “foppish”, “overbearing”,“unimaginative”, “lacking perception”, “autistic”, etc. - the list is long andvaried, but unanimous on certain points.I have been increasingly dissatisfied with the Cloven Hoof. Had I notfrequently intervened, it would have served as nothing more than a vehiclefor Mr. Aquino. Many issues were delayed because I had instructed him toprint items which he altered both in content and meaning. The only reasonhe was not bounced long ago is because of my affection for him and curableoptimism. Optimism that he would temper his growing self-righteousnessand revert to the capable and productive associate he once was. Optimismthat he would remain secure without adding any new certificates to his wallfull of them. And optimistic that he would accept the growing numbers ofcompetent candidates for degrees equaling his own, without theundisguised contempt he conveyed toward them.Despite what you have been led to believe, Michael Aquino haspresumed sovereignty in excess of his actual station. He is one of many, andhe knows it. He is not one of the Nine, as some of you who read this know;but not wishing to burst anyone’s balloon, I have watched him toss the termabout like a medicine ball.Mr. Aquino is an impeccable and irrepressible letter-writer andexcelled at test-passing and institutionalized paper work. He alsoingratiated himself with me, staked me to some fine meals, boughtbeautiful gifts, and ... attained his desired degrees. Now he sits, while othersare qualifying for those degrees by the same - and other - means, andfroths. Because of his impending condition, he was gradually cut off fromboth my own and Church developments. His mailing list has always beenkept fractional for obvious security reasons, now emphatically illustrated.The type of “caucus race” he has criticized in the past is now consuminghim.I have never laid claim to sainthood, and I revel in whatever pleasures Iam fortunate to receive. I’ll accept whatever I can get and enjoy it to thefullest. Insofar as my personal integrity is concerned, that is for others todecide. An empty barrel makes the most noise.Don’t be fooled by Mr. Aquino’s obsession with material contributionsas a means towards elevation. He has isolated it from other alternatives andbeaten you over the head with it. Degrees within the Church of Satan arenot only valid, but available to worthwhile persons by more diverse means- 1355 -than ever before. Despite Mr. Aquino’s withdrawal of my divine power to doso, I am running this outfit and am lawfully entitled to bestow degrees onwhomever I choose, whenever I choose to do so.As for the Organization, it is progressing according to plan (includingschism). Empirical evidence should confirm that. If you want to split, goahead. I won’t soft-soap you into thinking that there are no hard feelings,because there sure as Hell will be. But I’ll soon get over them. I have toomuch to do. That’s all I have to say.Rege Satanas!Anton Szandor LaVey- 1356 -- 1357 -Appendix 143: Reply to “Hoisted by His Own Patois”- by Michael A. AquinoJune 30, X ÆS/1975Several of you have brought to my attention a little gem entitled“Hoisted by His Own Patois”. This letter [a copy of which was not sentdirectly to me] is Anton LaVey’s response to my recent communiquésregarding the corruption of the Church of Satan and the creation of a neworganization in its place. Dr. LaVey, incidentally, has received copies of allthese communiqués directly from me.“Hoisted by His Own Patois” is factually inaccurate and quite insultingin tone. I had half-expected something like this, as I intimated in my June16 letter to you. And, as I said I would, I will now clarify the factual pointsand disregard the tone.Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Dr. LaVey iscorrect in saying that I declined to subordinate my own common sense tohis efforts to exploit the Church of Satan and its degree system. Hence Ireproached his authoritarian attitude and refusal to respect the standardsof ethics advertised by the Church over these many years.In the new organization [to be called the Temple of Set], the HighPriest will not be in a position to abuse his office. Final authority will restwith a Council of Nine, of which the High Priest will not be a member. Andadministrative matters of the Temple will be overseen by an ExecutiveDirector also appointed by the Nine. The interrelationship between theCouncil, the High Priest, and the Executive Director will be one ofcooperation, but it will also contain mutual checks and balances tosafeguard the organization against the fate of the Church of Satan. All thiswill be written into the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, copies ofwhich will be sent to you as soon as the drafts are ready.Anton LaVey then asserts that he never claimed to hold anythingresembling an “Infernal Mandate” and that he regards his titles as HighPriest and Exarch of Hell as “symbolic and not literal”. Taken at face value,such a statement would indicate that the Church of Satan and the SatanicBible were nothing more than an elaborate con game in which LaVeyexploited the name, imagery, and heritage of the Prince of Darkness.But I think his statement is not a true reflection of his actual feelings.For years Anton LaVey has spoken and written of the Prince of Darkness asan intelligent entity - not necessarily anthropomorphic, but quite real. Thisconviction of his is quite evident in both the Satanic Bible and many other- 1358 -documents of record. If he now seeks to pretend that he never meant any ofit, it is probably because that is the only way he could hope to excuse hisbetrayal of that entity.There was nothing supernatural in the Church of Satan, and there willbe nothing supernatural in the Temple of Set. The Church of Satan didconcern itself with experimentation in both formal and informal magic -being metaphysical assumptions and philosophical hypotheses for whichthere are not yet demonstrable scientific laws. The Temple of Set will carrythis forward, because it is interesting, stimulating, educational, and justplain fun to do so.I am next accused of “trying to mislead you in accordance with my ownrigidly fixed moral code”. It is true that I set great store by my personalintegrity, but it is not true that my understanding of ethics is rigidly fixed.Throughout life we are constantly confronted by new information whichexpands our perspective and frequently necessitates an “updating” ofpersonal philosophy.As for “misleading” recipients of the packets, I think that the contentsand cover letter of those packets speak for themselves.The next paragraph of Dr. LaVey’s letter is as follows:“Judging from initial response to Mr. Aquino’s packet, the vast majorityof recipients have reaffirmed their alliance with the Church of Satan. Responsehas been most gratifying and will not be forgotten. His behavior has beendescribed by communicants as: ‘petty’, ‘priggish’, ‘raging’, ‘puritanical’,‘bitchy’, ‘disgusting’, ‘foppish’, ‘overbearing’, ‘unimaginative’, ‘lackingperception’, ‘autistic’, etc. - the list is long and varied, but unanimous oncertain points.”The packets were sent to all of the officials listed in the enclosure to myJune 26 letter, plus Dr. & Mrs. LaVey, Magister John Ferro, MagisterAdrian-Claude Frazier, Reverend Stephen Hollander, Reverend StuartLevine, Warlock William R. Payne, Reverend & Mrs. James Stowe, andReverend & Mrs. Paul Pipkin. To date I have received no responses fromany of these people indicating the slightest dissatisfaction with my actionsor decisions - save from Anton LaVey and Paul Pipkin, both of whom havecommented upon my personality rather than upon the actual issue raised.Since Dr. LaVey does not get around to identifying the individualscomprising that “vast majority” of his, I confess myself somewhatsuspicious of his mathematics. Perhaps he ran off a few dozen more copiesof that packet and sent them off to officials of whom I have never heard?- 1359 -In any event, this mystery is easily resolved. Simply talk to one another,and you will discover who thinks what. Q.E.D.Anton LaVey next expresses increasing dissatisfaction with the ClovenHoof, saying that only his frequent intervention salvaged it from Editorialabuse. If in fact he were dissatisfied with the Hoof, he certainly did a goodjob of concealing it from me. In leafing through letters from him and Dianefollowing each issue, I find nothing but compliments.And as for his “instructions to print items which I subsequently alteredin both content and meaning”, that’s not quite accurate. Since I was firstinvited to edit the Hoof back in Louisville, I have received almost no inputfrom San Francisco save the Anton LaVey essay. Such alterations as I didmake in material not written by me were limited to the unsplitting ofinfinitives, the correction of grammar/spelling/punctuation, and theoccasional deletion of something which I thought the readership might findoffensive or undignified.With only one or two exceptions, each issue of the Hoof was typed infinal camera copy by me in Santa Barbara and forwarded to 6114 prior tothe turn of the month in question. Delays in the distribution of each issuewere due to printing and mailing procedures in San Francisco. When anyissue of the Hoof was returned to me for changes of any sort, a new cameracopy was in the mail within 24 hours.As a matter of fact, I am adding a few more certificates to my wall fullof them right now - a Master’s degree in Political Science from theUniversity of California, a diploma of graduation from the Officer’sAdvanced Course of the U.S. Army Armor School at Fort Knox, and acertificate of appreciation just received from the National Council of theBoy Scouts of America. Those who have seen my study know that my IV°certificate from Dr. LaVey occupies a place of prominence above and apartfrom the other 31 documents. I was quite satisfied with the IV° and in facthad just taken delivery on some fancy IV° stationery at a rather hefty pricewhen this situation developed.Apart from Tony, I am aware of two other individuals who received theblue Baphomet - John Ferro of San Francisco and Adrian-Claude Frazier ofDenver. I have always maintained friendly relations with both of them, astheir letters to me and mine to them evidence. I seem to recall that I alsopestered Anton and Diane unmercifully for months to get them to restoreJohn Ferro’s IV°, which had been invalidated following the cessation ofgroup activities at 6114 some years ago. In short, I encourage the titular- 1360 -recognition of those who deserve it, but I was and still am opposed to thebestowing of degrees for any reason other than demonstrated competence.Upon my elevation to the III° in June of V/1970, I was informed byAnton LaVey that I was to consider myself a member of the Council of Nine.Subsequently I was presented with the special medallion bearing thetrapezoid/pentagram/trident seal of that body. Subsequently I attendedoccasional meetings at 6114 with Magister Ferro, the LaVeys, and otherladies and gentlemen who certainly talked as though they were the Councilof Nine. If all this were an elaborate show for my benefit, then I can onlycompliment Anton and Diane for the elaborate rehearsing of roles and linesthat was obviously required. And if there is another Council of Nine lurkingin the shadows somewhere, I can only observe that it hasn’t done any of usmuch good!From the letters and face-to-face comments I have been getting frommany of you during these last couple of weeks, it does indeed appear that Iwas getting cut off from certain Church developments. Mail sent to me c/oSan Francisco was not forwarded if the contents disturbed the status quo,and both officials and members of the Church were constantly discouragedfrom writing to me by “Lana Green” and “John M. Kincaid”. Now a wholelot of facts are coming out in the wash, and I continue to be amazed at someof the things that have been going on.My mailing list is hardly fractional: Since November of VI/1971 I havemaintained and updated the entire Hoof mailing list, for the simple reasonthat it had previously been in such a mess that 6114 was inundated withrequests for missed issues, repeated address changes, repeated renewals,and new memberships not included on the list. If you were a member backin those grand old days, you probably remember the fun - particularly if youwere a Grotto Leader!Furthermore, whoever was in charge of “keeping my list fractional forsecurity reasons” did a pretty rotten job of it. Included on the list, as Imentioned in my 6/10 letter to the LaVeys, are a flock of the LaVeys’personal friends and publishing correspondents and Hollywood jet-setters.If I had indeed gone bananas and set out to ruin Anton LaVey, I wouldn’thave missed the chance to send Diane’s 6/4 letter to such people. How doyou think some of the Beverly Hills gang would react to a scheme to milkthem by selling them degrees? Probably not too enthusiastically. But I havenot done so, I do not intend to do so, and I don’t want any of you to do so. Itwill help nothing at this point, and it would only hurt the LaVeys. Weconcentrate only on cleaning our own house, right?- 1361 -Yes, I am opposed to material contributions as qualification fordegrees. I have set forth my reasoning in the letters included in my packet,and I don’t think I need to go over it again. To say that buying a degree is analternative to earning one is, to my way of thinking, worse than scrappingindividual accomplishment altogether and redesignating the degrees assimply a moneymaking gimmick. As Diane so accurately points out in her6/4 letter, it is precisely because the degrees have always symbolizedpersonal prowess that they are desirable."},{"pageContent":"As for the Church of Satan’s “progressing according to plan (includingschism)”, all I can say is that it must be some wild sort of plan indeed,involving the destruction of the Church of Satan, the discrediting of its HighPriest, and a great deal of unhappiness and disillusionment among all of itsofficials and members. And why? Because of a stupid scheme to make a fastbuck that would not have succeeded even if it had been implemented.Some plan indeed.And finally, Dr. LaVey - for you are getting a copy of this too - you havesome gall to say that you will nurture “hard feelings” against those whohave trusted you and followed you for years, only to find their achievementsprostituted for a financial stunt. Rather you should count yourself luckythat we are trying to approach the situation constructively, set this incidentto rest as gently as possible, and think of you in terms of the many positiveachievements you have authored. If you can’t help us, then I suggest youleave us alone until a future time when old wounds will not seem so painful.Perhaps then we may work together once again, as I believe the Prince ofDarkness would prefer.Xeper.Michael A. AquinoMagus V°High Priest of Set- 1362 -- 1363 -Appendix 144: “Satanism’s Gone Underground,but it’s Alive and Flourishing”- by Grant HardenSan Jose Mercury-News, October 29, 1978Satanism, a bizarre philosophy of self-love and self-indulgence,publicly hit the American scene during the mid-1960s, led by a tall, barbed-bearded “professional sinner” named Anton Szandor LaVey. He shaved hishead, donned a black cape, and declared himself to be the High Priest of theChurch of Satan, and the year 1966 to be I Anno Satanis. Anton LaVeybecame the first man in America to organize a religion based on Devil-worship, and to declare himself the emissary of Satan on Earth.For the next six years, operating out of a black-painted house in SanFrancisco’s posh Sea Cliff district908 , the one-time carnie, cop, andcalliope-player entertained a world fascinated by the Black Arts of magicand self-indulgence. Using stage props and costumes, and drawing uponyears of show-business experience, LaVey began attracting thousands of thecurious.By 1968, says his biographer Burton Wolfe, the Church of Satan hadattained a worldwide membership of nearly 17,000 and a following thatnumbered a great deal more. Satanic rituals generated columns of copy innewspapers and magazines across the country, all too much of it describingnaked female acolytes dancing to the crashing music of an organ in theunholy chapel. During consecration of the Black Mass, for example, LaVeywould lead the “congregation” in a reciting of the Lord’s Prayer -backwards. And using a nude woman as the altar, LaVey would conjure upthe powers of Lucifer, claiming there need be no fear or trembling beforethis dark force.Then, in the early 1970s, the activities of the Church of Satan vanishedfrom the public scene. LaVey had taken the movement underground. Now,in the first interview he has granted an American newsman since 1972,LaVey candidly admitted that in those early, formative years he had“hammed things up a bit”. In the interview LaVey expounded upon hisphilosophy of self-love and why the Church went “underground”. He was,he said, growing more serious about his work and tired of thesensationalism of what appeared in print. He had grown tired of mockingChristianity for mockery’s sake, and had set about designing rituals that908 Actually 6114 California Street is located in the Richmond District, east ofSea Cliff.- 1364 -took the negative aspects of the Christian Church “and turned them intosomething that is positive and fun”.“I found that we were beginning to appeal to too many ‘crazies’,”explained LaVey. “They would camp on our doorsteps, giving the press aheyday.” LaVey admits that those first half-dozen years - from 1966 to 1972- were his “prankish years”.“Unfortunately I found our efforts being relegated to culticproportions,” continued LaVey. “I discovered that I was being processed bythe media into something very sectarian. I found myself becomingpastoralized. I even wore a clerical collar for awhile.” The “black house” wasstarting to draw tourists from all over, and sightseeing buses had begun tomake it a key stop on their tours. “I could see the handwriting on the wall,”LaVey said. “Besides I was growing tired of playing fun and games.”The changes that have taken place in the Church of Satan since LaVeyand other officials of the Church decided to cease all public activities in SanFrancisco have been carefully noted by a number of sociologists. “It’s a veryelite group now,” said Marcello Truzzi, head of the Department of Sociologyat Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. Truzzi commented that “theyare more selective about those they accept as members, especially in theinner circles”.“LaVey has been able to deal more introspectively with his Satanicphilosophy since he has gotten away from the public crazies,” said Truzzi,who also is Editor of The Zetetic Scholar, a magazine of skeptical inquiryand academic writing on paranormal claims. Although Truzzi says themajority of members of the Church of Satan are in fact mail-order membersand geographically isolated joiners, there are clearly several hundred “fullyparticipating and disciplined members in the various parts of the world”.During two and a half years of studying the Church of Satan, Edward J.Moody, a Lecturer at Queen’s University of Belfast, Northern Ireland, saidthat he found Church membership to be a “mixed bag”. Moody was amember of the Church during the transition period, in the early 1970s.LaVey said a reason for taking the Satanic movement underground was“to protect the identity of our more serious members”. He said the publicaspect of Satanism had begun to trouble him and the many well-educatedindividuals practicing the Black Arts, making them targets of communityscorn and aggression. “A lot of our people are authority figures andopinion-makers, and desire to keep a low profile,” claimed LaVey.While refusing to disclose precise membership figures, LaVey did saythat membership in the Church of Satan today is made up of “a lot of people- 1365 -in law enforcement, the media, teaching, and positions of public service”.Moody said that as the Church of Satan has become more institutionalizedand less marginal, criteria for membership have been stiffened and theprocess of advancement formalized. A former member of the Church ofSatan, who asked not to be identified by name, claimed people would besurprised “by the number of military people associated with the Church …the large number of government people at a middle management level.”“And he has an awful lot of Hollywood contacts,” the ex-Satanistdeclared, observing that LaVey’s more important Hollywood connectionsprobably developed after his appearance as the Devil in the filmRosemary’s Baby, released in June of 1968. LaVey served as the film’stechnical director, as well as dressing up in a costume of latex and fur andreptilian scales for the scene in which he ravishes Rosemary. Since thenLaVey has served as an advisor on a host of films dealing with the diabolicaland admits that he has “profited handsomely” from his work in the movies(which also included the more recent Omen909 ) Only a few of the movies,LaVey claimed, accurately portrayed “the Devil, witchcraft, or magic asrecorded historically”. The Devil in Rosemary’s Baby, for example, saidLaVey, was really a composite of traditional literary descriptions of theDevil’s physical attributes.Satanists take themselves very seriously - and so, apparently, dosociologists, religious leaders, and the armed services. The military, toassist its chaplains who might find it awkward to minister to Satanists, haveestablished guidelines for dealing with soldiers, sailors, or airmen who aremembers of the Church of Satan. A Pentagon spokesman said that therewas no way to determine how many men and women in the armed servicesbelong to the Church of Satan, although he acknowledged that the Church“is a legitimate religious organization as far as we are concerned”.Precise membership figures are now a part of the cloak of secrecy thatLaVey has placed over the Church, and a subject of discussion he belittles.“What constitutes membership anyway?” asked LaVey. “We have had a lotof people put their names on the doted line since 1966, perhaps between60-65,000, and we don’t drop anyone from membership unless hespecifically requests it be done, or unless we want to get rid of him.”In the Mercury-News interview, LaVey gave another reason for soft-pedaling Church activities. “Religion should not be dependent upon itsexistence to the charismatic powers of one person, who has to be alive, who909 There is no evidence in the Omen series of films of any contribution byAnton LaVey.- 1366 -is dictating every move at the time,” LaVey said. “I was the first to bringSatanism out into the open, but I discovered my ego’s as bad as anyoneelse’s is. That’s why I stepped back. I labored hard to ensure that Satanismwould be more than a cult, a religious sect. But I don’t want to be deified,looked upon as a supernormal being, to be held up as an icon throughpictures and statues. It is not my intention for this to be a movementpredicated upon the worship of a man, and that when I die, the movementdies too.”LaVey, born April 11, 1930, joined the Clyde Beatty Circus in the lateforties, making good use of his classical music background by playing theorgan for the hootchy-kootchy and hula hula girls in the small towns up anddown the West Coast circuit. While a carnie, LaVey says he worked therides and other side shows, and learned to work the “mitt camp”, thecarnival colloquialism for that part of the show dealing with mystics, palmreaders, hypnotists, and magicians. For awhile in the fifties he played theorgan for burlesque theaters, backing up such stripping luminaries asTempest Storm, Evelyn West, and Lilli St. Cyr. From 1951-55 LaVey said heworked as a police photographer and “occult investigator” for the SanFrancisco Police Department, which may explain his affection for cops andhis down-the-line support for law and order. It was in the early sixties,while playing piano in peninsula nightclubs, that LaVey informallyorganized “The Magic Circle”, out of which emerged, in the words of a bayarea columnist, “those strange magic shenanigans in that bizarre blackhouse near the Cliff House…”- 1367 -Appendix 145: “The Devil in Anton LaVey”- by Walt HarringtonThe Washington Post Magazine, February 23, 1986Imagine Satan as a sentimental, middle-aged guy running a seedy barin San Francisco. The lighting in his tiny place is dim and dreamlike, as ifyou were walking through a thin, refractory mist where depth and focus areout of synch. Reach out to touch Gwen’s knee and you miss, and must reachagain, a few inches more this time.She sags against the bar, nearly passed out, her legs splayed, hergarters exposed, a puddle of urine on the floor beneath her. She’s tired andwrinkled, sad to see. But Steve, the smiling sailor with her, is on a shortleave from the war, World War II, and he’s not tired at all. Across the room,Bonita, hard and cynical and confident in her fox wrap, tight sweater, andpeg skirt, glowers at his intentions. She’s with Fritz the cabbie.Welcome to the Den of Iniquity, where proprietor and American highpriest of Satanism Anton Szandor LaVey is playing “Lover Man” on his oldHammond organ, its iridescent blue, red, and green keys illuminating hisbald head, goatee, quirky smile, and missing teeth. As always, he wearsblack.“I’ve known people who come in here and actually get nauseated,”LaVey chortles.The Den of Iniquity is not real - at least not real enough that you canwalk in off a foggy street and buy a shot of Ten High. No, Gwen and Steve,Bonita and Fritz are LaVey’s creations - polyurethane mannequins moldedwith his own hands on his own kitchen floor. Down to the clothing, thejewelry, the posters, and the Rock-ola jukebox, the Den of Iniquity isLaVey’s magical warp in time, circa 1944. His basement tavern, he says, ismore Satanic than a Black Mass.This night the Den of Iniquity also includes two real-life LaVeycreations - Terry, 26, and Blanche, 24. Their hair is blonde and styled in theway of the ’40s. They wear tight dresses, seamed stockings, garters, spikedheels. They are Satanists, and the 55-year-old LaVey is their fashionadvisor. He plays to them for hours: “Down on the Farm”, “My Man”, “ItHad to be You”.“I love old songs,” says Terry, a shy woman who has never made friendseasily. “They make me dream and escape. They don’t play this kind of musicanymore.”“Oh, they will!” assures LaVey. “They will!”- 1368 -LaVey, a Magus, or master of magic, is seeing to that - tonight and mostevery night he sits at his organ or his music synthesizers and imbues theatmosphere with magical vibratory frequencies. He believes they arechanging the psyche of the world and creating a New Romantic, yet Satanicrevolution. You thought Linda Ronstadt’s Nelson Riddle album made youdon a tuxedo and go ballroom dancing, that Madonna made your daughterturn to black lace, that Pia Zadora made you rediscover Gershwin? No, thespirit of the Devil did it - with a little help from LaVey, who deftly seguesinto “Ragtime Cowboy Joe”.“I can see the girl on the stage twirling the lasso,” sighs Terry. “Doctor,it makes me dream!”And then the magic happens: In the infinite reflection of the mirroredwalls, it is, for an instant, impossible to tell which LaVey creations arehuman and which are humanoid: the hair, the stockings, the musk, the airof sordid romance, the clink of ice in a whiskey glass.“I wish I was one of those dolls!” Terry says, lost. “It’s like walking intothe past. I wish I was one.”“It was a strong Satanic ritual,” LaVey says of the bizarre evening as heheads to the Jack-in-the-Box for breakfast. “We had the right people andthe right moment. We were immersed, swept into another time, anotherplace, another era. Time stood still. At the eye of madness and mystery.”It’s been twenty years since Anton LaVey shaved his head and declaredhimself High Priest of the Church of Satan. His was a pop diabolism, aMachiavellian atheism with cloven hoof.“Satan is a symbol, nothing more,” LaVey says. “Satan signifies our loveof the worldly and our rejection of the pallid, ineffectual image of Christ onthe cross.”LaVey believes in neither God nor Satan, and his Satanic “religion” is aparody of Christianity - with a heavy dose of magic, as in Sorcerer’sApprentice magic. But LaVey doesn’t worship Satan. The Devil is a symbolof man’s carnal nature - his lust, greed, vengeance, but most of all his ego,all drives LaVey says Christianity has unfairly labeled “evil”.But LaVey’s Satanism also lashes out at the rubes who take the TenCommandments seriously. Satanism, he says, is already the ad hoc reality:The strong, not the meek, inherit the world! LaVey, like anyone, loves hisfriends, wife, and children. But there is a venom in his Satanism that goesbeyond parody. Among his teachings: “Death to the weakling, wealth to thestrong.”- 1369 -Two decades of Satanism have been good to LaVey. He collects classiccars, and has several luxurious homes and a 185-foot yacht at his disposal.A follower pays his medical insurance. He’s parlayed Satanism into abusiness consulting Hollywood horror-film makers on authentic Satanicritual. He charges $100 a session for Satanic counseling, and there are theroyalties from his several books.LaVey’s religion of the darker side, however, does have a darker side.“What I have done is opened a Pandora’s box,” he says. Since he foundedhis church, Satanism has come a long way: The Devil has become rockmusic’s nihilistic symbol, and there have been the Satan-tinged murders -from Charles Manson to the Night Stalker.“These people are not Satanists,” says LaVey, eyes closed, voice awhisper. “They are deranged. But no matter how many they do, they’llnever catch up with the Christians. We have centuries of psychopathickilling in the name of God.”LaVey, it turns out, is a law-and-order man. He hates rock music - withor without Satanic lyrics. And he insists he’s misunderstood. “The Catholicswere once thought of as devils by Protestants. The Protestants were devilsto the Catholics. The Jews were considered devils by both. The white manwas considered a devil by the Chinese. The American Indian wasconsidered a devil by the white man. Now who really is evil? Who is to saywho is evil?”Anton LaVey is not a cartoon Satan. He’s far less frightening than youmight imagine, because he is admittedly a carnival hustler. Yet he is stillterrifying because he touches, if not the mystical darkness, then thepsychological darkness - the hate and fear - in us all. And because he, sadly,knows a haunting truth: Everybody wants to feel better than somebodyelse.LaVey is a junkyard intellectual, a philosopher of the sordid, a savant,an ingratiating and funny man. He’s a man who could find no faith, until hediscovered magic. But Anton LaVey worships only Anton LaVey. Hisreligion is egotism - and his church, his Den of Iniquity, his dolls, hiswomen are shadows of that ego. And that, as Anton LaVey would say, istruly Satanic.It’s a hard winter in San Francisco, and LaVey’s house, with shadesalways drawn, is dark and cold - cold as, well, a tomb. But sit down inRasputin’s sled chair and relax, thumb through LaVey’s collection of girliecalendars. “A uniquely American art form,” he says. Look closely at theJivaro shrunken head from Ecuador, or examine the Aztec knife that once- 1370 -cut hearts from human victims, or study the torture hook from theInquisition. “All done in the name of religion,” he laughs.LaVey wears a black ascot with his black shirt and slacks, and relaxes inthe eerie glow of his purple sitting room, where he explains the magicalpower of being different for difference’s sake.“The word ‘occult’ simply means ‘hidden’ or ‘secret’,” he says. “Go tothe record store, to the corner where no one else is, where everything isdusty and nobody ever goes. Mussorgsky’s ‘Night on Bald Mountain’ ismystical music, dramatic, Gothic, Satanically programmed music. But it’snot occult music. ‘Yes, We Have No Bananas’ would be an occult tune.“It’s occult because when you put that record on the turntable, it’s alead-pipe cinch that there is not another person in the entire world who islistening to that record at that time. If there’s anything, any frequency, anypower that exists anywhere in this cosmos, in this universe, you’re gonnastand out like a beacon! It truly makes you elite.”LaVey’s house must beam like a zillion watts. It’s a museum of theweird. On the Victrola is “The Love Nest Medley Fox Trot”. His collection ofsuch odd melodies runs into the thousands. He loves Irving Berlin’s “StayDown Here Where You Belong”, in which the Devil proclaims: “You’ll findmore hell up there than there is below.” And don’t forget the classics: Liszt’s“Mephisto Waltz” and Saint-Saens’ “Dans Macabre”.Are freaks your interest? LaVey has hundreds of production stills fromthe 1932 film Freaks. It did poorly, but he likes it because the freakseventually overpower their “normal” prison keepers.All this is a long way from the day 17-year-old Anton LaVey ran awayfrom home to work as a cage boy for circus lion tamer Clyde Beatty. LaVeylater became a carnival mentalist and hypnotist, then a bump-and-grindorgan player for a stripper named Marilyn Monroe. His friends in thosedays were hustlers, con men, and carny freaks. He recalls once going to thestore with three-eyed Bill Durks, who wore a cap to hide the eye in themiddle of his forehead. Said the man at the checkout: “What’s a matter,buddy, ya embarrassed to take off your hat?” So Durks did - the man gotsick and had to be helped away. “He had it coming,” laughs LaVey.It was a world turned upside down: Saturday nights the young LaVeyplayed organ to a male crowd at the carnival sex shows; Sunday morning heplayed the same organ for the same men - now with their wives and kids -at the evangelist’s tent.In the ’50s LaVey left one seedy world for another, becoming a SanFrancisco Police Department crime scene photographer. Yet his growing- 1371 -obsession with magic also led to the “Magic Circle” gatherings at his home,and the flamboyant showman LaVey became a gossip column staple.The Church of Satan seemed like more carny biz: Nude womensprawled atop a Satanic altar, Black Masses, scarlet robes, horned caps, theblasphemous cries of “Hail, Satan!” - much of it available for film at 11. Itwas a freak show. But then, in 1967, LaVey performed a public Satanicwedding. Fifty reporters attended, and the Los Angeles Times ran a front-page photo.Presto, Satan had his first mass media minister - a minister who didn’teven believe in Satan! But the Christian view of the Devil as pure evil was,ironically, a media magnet: Life, Look, Time, McCall’s, and hundreds moretold the story. Jayne Mansfield joined the church. LaVey played the Devil inRoman Polanski’s movie Rosemary’s Baby - and, presto, became a Satanicconsultant to Hollywood. He published The Satanic Bible, now with morethan 500,000 copies in print. He did Johnny Carson. As a favor toMansfield, he put a curse on her lawyer - who was soon dead in a caraccident. Unfortunately Mansfield died with him. The tragedy only spreadLaVey’s legend.But the weirdness also began. The church was popular with Hell’sAngels, Nazis, and sex-starved men. There were death threats againstLaVey, and his daughter was harassed at school. Suddenly the Sataniccircus was no fun anymore. So in the ’70s LaVey went underground,stopped all public ceremonies, recast his church as a secret society - andpushed deeper into his private world of “madness and mystery”.Today the man is seriously arcane. He collects not only old records, butHoratio Alger books, Satanic artifacts, and “Satanic” movies that portrayman’s darker side as tragically heroic. “The most Satanic film characterever?” asks LaVey. Perhaps Edward G. Robinson in The Sea Wolf, whichopens at a page from John Milton’s Paradise Lost: “Better to reign in Hellthan serve in Heaven.” Or Walter Huston as the cynical prospector whokeeps his decency in The Treasure of Sierra Madre while that of the naïveHumphrey Bogart disintegrates in greed. Or the benignly deluded PeterO’Toole in The Ruling Class, in which he believes he is Christ until hisaristocratic family convinces him it’s more respectable to be Jack theRipper.“My all-time favorite quote is novelist Somerset Maugham: ‘If only thegood were a little less heavy footed’,” says LaVey, who is forever reachingfor this or that quote, turning to just the right page and reading it aloud. Hereaches for a Maugham biography and quotes him again: “‘I had Rev.- 1372 -Davidson rut in bed with Sadie Thompson in Rain … Some said I had setback missionary endeavors around the world a hundred years … ActuallyRev. Davidson was closer to spirituality in bed wildly fornicating with SadieThompson than at any time in his life.’”That, in a nutshell, is the philosophy of Anton LaVey.The Purple Room is so cold tonight that everyone wears overcoats. It’s3 or 4 in the morning, but a few Satanists have dropped by - Terry, Blanche,and Gene, a close LaVey friend and the owner of an auto repair garage. Likethe Den of Iniquity, the tiny, freezing room is oddly disconnected from anymooring outside itself.The evening’s topic is the abundance of fools in the world, and LaVeygoes to the shelf for his collection of photo essay books on MiddleAmericans - books that seem to tell more about the people in the PurpleRoom than they do the people in the pictures. LaVey sits in his recliner, inblack shirt and lavender tie, gold loop earring in his left lobe. He leans overthe coffee table, his books and his guests spread before him.“It’s really depressing,” he says in his raspy whisper. In the dim,reddish light LaVey resembles Christopher Lloyd as the whacked-outgenius in Back to the Future. “The paper tablecloth. The Tide box. Themetal folding chairs. Wonderful! The good life!”His friends pick up the theme and begin to poke fun at the pictures ofpeople in their Military Order of the Louse fraternal uniforms, the peoplesitting in their tacky living rooms, the people smiling gawkishly from everyimaginable vacation boardwalk.LaVey thumbs the pages of Michael Lesy’s Time Frames, a heartfeltsocial biography of average American families, although LaVey doesn’t seeit that way. “Who would read a whole book about these people’s lives!?” heasks. “Yes, it’s very Satanic. You know why? Because the average personthinks that his life means something, that people will give a crap about it.This guy has taken real nonentities, people who nobody would ever give acrap if they ever lived or died. It’s Satanic because it comes full circle. It’snot just dignifying them. It’s like putting the microphone in front of thedrunk. It’s really being sadistic.”“It’s like The Circus of Dr. Lao,” Blanche says.“It really is,” says LaVey, and he goes to the shelf for a passage from theobscure 1935 novel by Charles G. Finney, a scene in which the widow Mrs.Howard T. Cassan visits Dr. Lao’s mystical circus and insists on hearing herfuture from Apollonius, a fortune teller who must forever speak the truth:“And for all the good or evil, creation or destruction, that your living might- 1373 -have accomplished,” Apollonius tells her, “you might just as well never havelived at all.”“The pretentiousness of these people,” LaVey says angrily. “Thinkingthat their little, petty, insignificant lives might really have some effect inthescheme of human existence. I mean they’re lumps. They’re ciphers.”The other day LaVey talked about a man at the Jack-in-the-Box, a manwho walked in, pounded on the counter, and then looked around with agoofy smile on his face. “What would the world miss if he were dead,”LaVey asked. “If someone put a gun to his head and blew him away, whowould care?”“They’re not even zombies!” Blanche says. “Because they never had alife in the first place. They’re just zeros! It’s frightening.”At 4 in the morning, in a freezing purple room with a bald Satanist in alavender tie and two Adele Jergens look-alikes, this bolstering of egos at theexpense of everyone else seems suddenly far more sad and frightening thanfat people in their Military Order of the Louse uniforms. It even seems evil.“Satan is important as the accuser, the prideful angel,” Gene says. “Hewas kicked out for thinking he could run things as well as the big guy. He isa symbol of the ego. And that’s why these books are Satanic. They point thefinger, act as the mirror to humanity and say, ‘Look, look at what you are!You are no better than this. And this is nothing.’”LaVey whispers, “Behold your glorious handiwork, Brahma, Buddha,Christ. These are the people you have exalted.”The file cabinets are overflowing with church applications ($100 for alifetime membership), and Blanche works full-time keeping up with them -plus the mail, the updating of LaVey’s books, the selling of Church of Satanmedallions ($50), the typing and mailing of his 2,000-circulationnewsletter, The Cloven Hoof. The Macintosh computer helps.Blanche pulls out stacks of church membership applications, whichinclude questions on everything from sexual preferences to favorite jokes topolitical philosophy. Among the applicants:A 49-year-old former Catholic nun from the South. She is a lesbian whoenjoys Rod McKuen and Maurice Ravel, Abbott and Costello, BrunoBettelheim, and Sherlock Holmes. She is a substitute schoolteacher. OfLaVey’s Satanic Bible she says: “It speaks to me and touches me like fewwritten pieces. I want my anger expressed. I want to finally be real withmyself.”The applicants seem so normal, so mundane - like the neighbors inRosemary’s Baby: the office manager from Beverly Hills, the musician- 1374 -from Chicago, the plumber from Indiana, the retired Army sergeant fromthe South, the farmer from Nebraska: a photo shows him sitting on thecouch with his wife and two children! These and a half-dozen Satanists whocome and go through LaVey’s home all say there is no anthropomorphicSatan with a red suit, pitchfork, and horns: He is a Christian myth to scarepeople into the pews.But there are those who confuse myth and reality: The nice, middle-aged woman who sat a few feet away on the couch the other night and saidthe Devil - with horns and cloven hooves - makes love to her in her dreams,sometimes gently and sometimes violently. She said she’d do anything forSatan, even kill.Sociologists who have studied LaVey’s church say its members oftenhad serious childhood problems, like alcoholic parents or broken homes, orthat they often were traumatized by guilt-ridden fundamentalistupbringings, turning to LaVey’s Satanism as a dramatic way to purge theirdebilitating guilt. But another trait also seems to repeat: Satanists professto believe that, except for themselves, the world is full of idiots and foolsand chumps.“They want to be different,” says LaVey of his followers. “They feeldifferent. They are different.”It’s another desperately cold night, but the whiskey helps. LaVey’svitriolic anger of the other evening has receded, and he’s in a good mood,cracking jokes as he flicks switches on his bank of seven music synthesizers.They are set against a wall mural of the Devil enveloping a city as itsinhabitants sleep. Magic, LaVey explains, is always best performed whilepeople sleep, because they are then the most susceptible. So from hiskitchen- cum-magical laboratory, LaVey has for five years, night after night,tried to change the world.“My goal was to use music as a magical weapon to change the face ofsociety - to provide new options through the New Romanticism.”The rock revolution, he says, has meant the dominance of hostile,pounding music - the beat, beat, beat. “It’s been the end of romance,” hesays. So LaVey decided music must return to an earlier, melodic time, totunes that made people introspective, imaginative, and nostalgic - thetunes, it just so happens, that were popular when Anton LaVey grew up.Magic, he says, simply taps the unrecognized energy of human emotion:love or hate, fear or joy - emotion is emotion. People able to unconsciouslyfeel the emotional power in LaVey’s nostalgic tunes are magical people. Andthey are his new elite.- 1375 -“Let the hard-rock fans with their Satanic lyrics live like the losers inEscape from New York!” he says. With LaVey pouring magic into the ethernightly, he expects a younger generation of his superior romantic beings -people far less infected with Christian guilt than their parents - to flock tohis Satanism.“I don’t believe in ‘supernatural’ magic,” he says. “I believe in‘supernormal’ magic, meaning that when certain frequencies are sent outinto the ether, they affect the human subconscious in much the way thatcertain circus tunes make elephants march.” LaVey then runs through amedley of “rain songs” - “Singin’ in the Rain”, “Let a Smile be YourUmbrella”, a dozen more.“Putting this leitmotif together is magical because I’m the only one whoknows it. It sets up a Jungian gestalt. It’s called magical superimposition.It’s like five characters waiting for a play: I provide the play.” LaVey thenheightens and sharpens secret magical tonal patterns that he hasdiscovered through years of trial and error. “You get a lot of rain songstogether, and imagine all the creative energy, amalgamated creative energy,that went into those songs. Combine that with the emotional energy Iproduce in playing it. If the audience is right, like the other night in thebar,I can do something very magical because of ego-circuitry.”Proof that magic works? LaVey knew Hatfield the Rainmaker! He sawit work! What is magic today will be science tomorrow, he says, when theeffect of biochemical energy is finally understood. He sees proof of magiceverywhere. Not just in the return to romantic tunes and nostalgic fashion,but in parking spaces conjured up on the street and good tables appearingsuddenly at restaurants, not to mention the San Diego McDonald’smassacre and the Mexican earthquake that resulted accidentally afterLaVey vented some anger on the keys. He is like a faith healer who has seentoo many miracles to doubt. “It’s truly frightening,” he says.There is a long silence. What would you have said? Your cause/effectrelationships are spurious? Your assumptions are pre-scientific? You’vebeen under the sun-lamp too long? You say he’s crazy. Crazier than theMaharishi Mahesh Yogi who says Transcendental Meditation sends outfrequencies that can shape world decisions? Crazier than ShirleyMacLaine’s reincarnation? Crazier than people who pray to God? Or peoplewho pray to saints?“I started out like Edward G. Robinson in Night Has a ThousandEyes,” LaVey says. “A carny mental act, a fraud. I believed everything wasfixed, gaffed. Then, like Robinson, you start to get real flashes. Only if you- 1376 -know the tricks can you see the reality. Only if your life isn’t full ofmiraclescan you recognize the real miracle.“Why are you here?” LaVey asks. “Why you, who liked the obscureSatanic movie The Ruling Class? What part in this little Jungian fugue doyou have!?” And with that LaVey has come a long way from twenty yearsago when he set out to parody Christianity. Religious providence has beenreplaced with magical providence. He says, “Nothing happens without areason.”Says LaVey’s friend, Eastern Michigan sociologist Marcello Truzzi: “Ifyou wear a mask long enough, it starts to stick to your face. Then it becomesyour face.”It’s opera night, and downtown San Francisco is packed. LaVey says hewill conjure up a parking spot, and, yes, we park a single car away from thefront door to a crowded Max’ Opera Cafe, where, yes, a table opens up a fewfeet away from the piano where they are singing “Hello, Bluebird” and“Time After Time”. Magical songs.“Sometimes I get so tired,” says LaVey, perhaps made introspective bythe music. “Like old man river.”For two decades now LaVey has thumbed his nose at all things sacredand respectable. But getting older, he now craves begrudging respect fromthose he has flaunted. “Let’s give credit where credit is due,” he says. TheSatanic rock lyrics, the Satanic movies, even the Satanic murders, he says,all grew from the Church of Satan. “Let’s give me a little credit for havingmoved society - up or down - but for at least having moved it.”The passage LaVey read the other night from The Circus of Dr. Laocomes to mind: “And for all the good or evil, creation or destruction, thatyour living might have accomplished, you might just as well never havelived at all.” It is this egotist’s nightmare that haunts LaVey: Did I matter?Did I call the tune? Was I the ringmaster?So LaVey created a mirrored reality, a Den of Iniquity in the mind, anupside-down carnival reality where all freaks are heroic and all goodburghers are nitwits, a reality that from every vantage reflected only hisown ego, a true Satanic feat. LaVey smiles: “You are really beginning tounderstand me.” But what about Blanche and Terry in their mawkishclothes and makeup? Aren’t they props for your selfishness? LaVey laughsand quotes Dracula: “If you will fall down and worship me - consider,practice, allow yourself to be a reflection of my needs, decide to choose meas your master - it will literally free you to go out into the world and beyourself.”- 1377 -And your glorification of hatred for people you don’t even know, two-dimensional images in a book? “You can’t blame me,” LaVey says. “Howcan you respect people who will throw away a week’s pay to win a plasticdoll? What do I care what people think? I despise them!”Don’t you ever wonder about evil, though - about the old saying thatthe Devil’s best allies are those who don’t believe in him? LaVey is quiet fora moment.“Oh, yes, deep down I have my speculation that maybe there is a forceI’ve tapped into, that I can extract. But I hate to talk about these things. Imean, Jayne Mansfield’s death was a strange thing! It was like Night Has aThousand Eyes. It was a hell of a coincidence! Time and space all comingtogether to merge like color transparencies. What ingredients contributedto this? These things are too much for coincidence. But still I want tobelieve that they are coincidences. I’m basically just a good, decent guy.“When you ask me what if I came to believe there was some malevolentforce, would I want to do it differently? The answer is no. It’s too late. Iwouldn’t give them the satisfaction. Not when I see what they have done inthe world. There’ll be no deathbed confession.” Not from Anton LaVey, notfrom the prideful angel. He is beyond redemption.- 1378 -- 1379 -Appendix 146: Review - Satan Wants You by Arthur Lyons- by Michael A. Aquino VI°Scroll of Set #XIV-3, July XXIII (1988) and #XV-3, June XXIV (1989)Three years ago I received a telephone call from Arthur Lyons, one-time Satanist I° in the Church of Satan and author of the first major bookon that institution ( The Second Coming: Satanism in America, 1970 - T.S.reading list #6Q). Art said that he was planning to update the book andwanted information concerning the Temple of Set. I sent him a copy of theCrystal Tablet and some current Scroll issues, and heard nothing furtherfrom him thereafter. When the revised book surfaced recently, I wastherefore quite curious to see not only how we fared, but also how Lyonshandled the post-1975 rigor mortis of the Church of Satan and the recenthysterical wave of “Satanic child abuse”.Now having read the book, I would give Art poor marks for hishandling of the Temple of Set, medium ones for his discussion of theChurch of Satan, and high ones for his meticulous and informed rebuttal ofthe “child abuse” hate-propaganda.My reservations concerning Lyons’ handling of the Church of Satan andTemple of Set stem simply from a great many erroneous statements whichhe makes - all of which he could have easily corrected had he been morepainstaking with his research. Details follow:Page 106: The phony LaVey affair with Marilyn Monroe is repeatedagain, though Lyons borrowed Magister Moffatt’s copy of my Church ofSatan history and knows that it is highly improbable LaVey ever knew,much less had an affair with Monroe. 910Page 108: According to Sammy Davis’ wife Altovise, Sammy set up onedinner meeting at his home to introduce Anton to Christopher Lee - and itwas a near disaster, with the two Mephistophelian personalities being keptfrom overt antagonism by Sammy’s efforts. “Lee,” Anton later remarked tome curtly, “is too big for his shroud.” 911Page 108: The “Jayne Mansfield Curse” again ... yawn. 912Page 112: In The Satanic Rituals the Tierdrama was attributed to an oldO.T.O. text and to the Bavarian Illuminati. Both of those balloons were910 Chapter #2.911 Chapter #24.912 Chapter #3.- 1380 -punctured in The Church of Satan, so now Anton has conjured up TheEmerald Book of Thoth as a source. [The Emerald Tablet of Thoth is afamous legendary repository of magical wisdom, a la the Necronomicon.Crowley later used the title to rename the Tarot deck, and the JeweledTablets of Set are also named in honor of the Emerald Tablet. It’s abouttime for Anton to give H.G. Wells his sole due for a good story, i.e. TheIsland of Dr. Moreau, and let it go at that.]913Page 113: I was not “commissioned” [for a fee] to write the “Call toCthulhu” and “Ceremony of the Nine Angles”; I simply did them as a favorto Anton. 914Page 115: The list of Grottos attributed to the year 1973 is ratherinflated. At that time there were no Grottos in Dayton, Phoenix, Seattle, St.Petersburg, Las Vegas, Indianapolis, Chicago, Vancouver, or Edmonton -just isolated Regional Agents or “underground priests”. The Grottos inBoston, Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, and Louisville were all headed byPriests/Priestesses who resigned in 1975 in response to Anton’s degree-selling decision. The Grotto in Denver was shut down by its frightenedleader (Magister Charles Steenbarger) because of a drug/suicide scandal, 915and the Stygian Grotto in Dayton had already been closed down by Antonbecause of a drug/theft scandal there. 916The membership of the Church of Satan at its peak ca. 1974-75 wasabout 250, with another 100 or so nonmember subscribers to the ClovenHoof. I know for the simple reason that, as CH Editor, I managed themailing list and had to work closely with Diane LaVey on a monthly basis tokeep track of the new memberships, renewals, address changes, etc. 917Pages 115-116: I am a bit tired of hearing “observer” James Moody putdown the Church of Satan’s membership as emotionally crippled. It wasgood enough for him when he joined the Church and became a Priest in it- a detail Lyons omits. 918 [Moody served as my principal assistant during913 Chapter #22 and Appendix #6.914 Chapter #22 and Appendix #74.915 Chapter #31.916 Chapter #17.917 Appendix #143.918 Chapters #3, #6, #16, #25.- 1381 -the first full Black Mass conducted at 6114 California Street in 1970, and dida pretty good job of blasphemy as I recall.]Page 118: Anton LaVey didn’t exactly “reject” the overtures of NRPleader James Madole. He visited Madole’s headquarters in NYC andaccepted a NRP membership card from him. 919Page 119: The actual correspondence between Anton LaVey and myselfat the time of the 1975 crisis is reproduced in full in The Church of Satan.At no time did the issue of “theology” arise; it was a matter of financialexploitation pure and simple - flying in the face of the many statementsconcerning the incorruptible nature of the Satanic Priesthood which Antonhad issued throughout the previous nine years [many of which are alsoreproduced in COS].I did not resign my Priesthood, but rather my affiliation with anorganization which I contended had forfeited its right to confer thatPriesthood. It was in this same precise spirit that not only Lilith butvirtually every other functioning Priest and Priestess of the Church of Satanceased affiliation.Nor did “Lilith and I” found the Temple of Set. It was founded jointlyby all of the Priesthood, with its founding Council of Nine selected by itsown membership in a careful procedure lasting several months.LaVey’s claim that the crisis was part of his “master plan” is absurd.The people who resigned were not the “dependent, parasitic groupies”, butrather those principled individuals who had worked so hard for so manyyears to raise the Church of Satan beyond that level. [For an example of“dependent, parasitic groupies who parade about town wearing theirBaphomets” I would refer Lyons to the profiles of 1966/68-era C/Smembers profiled in Burton Wolfe’s Devil’s Avenger biography of AntonLaVey. That crowd had faded away by 1975 - although it seems that itcrawled back in thereafter.]Page 120: The Grottos weren’t “phased out”. They just evaporated inJune 1975 when their nationwide leadership all left to form the Temple ofSet. After 1975 there were only two attempts at Grottos: a short-lived effortin Los Angeles by a lady named Dee Lucas and Maarten Lamers’ sex-cluboperation in Amsterdam.Page 121: The reason the Church of Satan didn’t apply for tax-exemptstatus had nothing to do with principle. To qualify for tax-exempt statusfrom the California Franchise Tax Board and Internal Revenue Service, an919 Chapter #32.- 1382 -organization must open all of its books, budgets, and papers to thereviewing authorities. This is what the Temple of Set did in order to qualifyfor its own tax-exempt status in 1975.There was no “international headquarters” in Amsterdam, just Lamers’sex-club which Anton could use as a convenient address to impress theroobs accordingly.Page 122: According to our own sources in Belgium, there is no “largeSatanic underground” there. There are some serious individuals there withan interest in serious Satanism [as opposed to commercial sexmasquerading as same], which is precisely why the Temple of Set has cometo know them.Page 123: During my visit to London last month, I received a messagethat Ron Adams wanted to meet with me. Due to other appointments wedid not meet, but I was told that he also hasn’t heard from California Streetin years. Same old story.I disbelieve Anton’s claim of 2,000 Cloven Hoof subscribers not onlybecause of his past penchant for inflating membership figures, but alsobecause if there were that many C/S people floating around the country, wewould naturally bump into them. And we don’t - save for an occasional, lostindividual who expected more than a l-page, quarterly newsletter when hejoined the infamous Church of Satan. [He should have been around when itwas cooking with gas in 70- 75!]920Page 125: Actually I first encountered Anton in 1968, not 1969, at thepremiere of Rosemary’s Baby in San Francisco. 921 And I was ordained tothe Priesthood III° in 1970, not 1971. 922Page 126: There was no rift whatever between Anton and myself in1972. That rift came sharply and precisely in May 1975 when Antonannounced his degree-selling policy. As the abundant correspondencebetween Anton, Diane, and myself reproduced in The Church of Satanevidences, the LaVeys and I were as close as family during the 1972-May1975 period.I wasn’t the least interested in seeing Anton relinquish administrativepower. I took on various routine jobs, such as the Cloven Hoof Editorship,920 The financial reports filed as part of Anton LaVey’s 1992 bankruptcy show nomembership or subscription income from the Church of Satan whatever. See Chapter#37.921 Preface.922 Chapter #6.- 1383 -to free him and Diane from them. Otherwise I was proud to see his hand atthe helm. So confident in his leadership, in fact, that I never bothered toconcern myself with the finances or corporate structure of the Church,which he had concentrated in his own hands. We learned this lesson well in1975, which is why the Temple of Set was set up as a corporation whichlegally belongs to the Priesthood of Set collectively, not to any singleindividual.Any notion that the Church of Satan was internally an atheisticinstitution prior to 1975 is laughable to anyone who was involved with itbeyond the most superficial level. It was the Church of Satan, not acabaret or expressionist encounter group. Anton LaVey knew this, I knew it,the Priesthood of Mendes knew it, and any Satanist holding at least the II°knew it. Publicly the Church put out the “atheism with psychodrama” lineso that it wouldn’t scare society beyond tolerance-level. After 1975 AntonLaVey merely slipped smoothly into this image, which was all that hecould do in light of his betrayal of the Prince of Darkness. 923Page 126: Founding membership of the Temple of Set was about 100ex-Church of Satan members, not 28. They came from all over the UnitedStates and Canada, not just from New York, Washington, and Los Angeles.Page 127: The Book of Coming Forth by Night refers to the Age, not theÆon of Satan. I was not “anointed worldwide leader”, but simply Magus ofthe Æon, which is more akin to the formulator of a philosophy than to apolitical mogul.I hope I don’t follow too closely in Jack Parsons’ footsteps, as he blewhimself up in a laboratory experiment! 924I have always had a natural widow’s peak and naturally-pointedeyebrows [as photographs from my childhood will attest]. I have seen the“666 tattoo” rumor bouncing around long enough to let it continue to be anenigma; life should have some mysteries …925The Temple of Set’s decision to take the unadorned Pentagram of Set asits insignia was mandated by the Book of Coming Forth by Night as a923 Chapters #36 and #37.924 A critical/skeptical account of Parsons’ involvement with Crowley appears inJohnSymonds’ The Great Beast (London: Macdonald, 1971). A more empathetic account,together with a collection of Parsons’ best magical writings, was published bythe FalconPress, Las Vegas in 1989 under the title Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword by JohnWhiteside Parsons.925 Thought you’d find the answer to the mystery in this footnote, didn’t you?- 1384 -rejection of the Hebrew embellishments in the Baphomet emblem. The“trademarking” of the Baphomet by LaVey had nothing to do with it.Indeed the Baphomet used by the Church of Satan was not created by it,but was used for years in many books on Satanism, Dennis Wheatleynovels, etc. before the Church was ever founded. It is clearly in the publicdomain. 926 Recently Anton has taken to putting it on his Cloven Hoof withan ® next to it, which is about par for the course in the post-1975 “Churchof Satan”.The Temple of Set’s degree system is not a duplicate of the GoldenDawn’s, as Lyons ought well to know from the copy of the Crystal Tablet Isent him.Lilith holds the degree of Magistra Templi IV°, not Magus V° (which inthe case of a female would be Maga V°).I accepted the degree of Magus V° in 1975 - the same degree whichAnton LaVey asserted in 1966 upon the founding of the Church of Satan, Imight add. I did not take the Oath of Ipsissimus until the Ides of MarchXIV.Page 128: “Xepering” is a new hieroglyphic term to me, and “kepering”sounds like a way to cook a fish. The Egyptian hieroglyphic Xeper ispronounced “kepher”, of course.Pylon meetings are not necessarily held once a month. They may beheld more or less frequently, as the Pylon might prefer - or not at all, as inthe case of the various Pylons which operate by mail, computers, etc. overgreat distances.Setian rituals are not designed to “break down the subjective andobjective worlds”, but - quite the opposite - to strengthen one’s awarenessof the reality of both and the distinction between them, which then makesthe principle of the magical link between them possible.Page 129: While Lyons is quite right that we don’t drink blood in ourrituals, there is no prohibition of alcoholic beverages. [He probably gotconfused because I myself am a non-alcohol drinker. Anton LaVey didn’tknow this at the time of my III° ordination, so on that occasion the chalicewas filled with Wild Turkey or some such. Naturally one doesn’t refuse theproffered chalice on such an occasion, so it was a heady experience for mein more ways than one.]The Temple of Set has never placed an ad in Fate magazine, nor in anyother occult magazine. We did run an ad in a San Francisco “new age”926 Chapter #37.- 1385 -directory publication, which after several years of tolerating that terrible,stark inverse pentagram amidst all the white-light fluff finally got theshakes and invited us out. The Yellow Pages are made of sterner stuff;we’re still there.Applications for admission to the Temple require Council of Nineapproval only in the case of former members who are seeking readmission.Otherwise any member of the Priesthood of Set is empowered to admit aSetian. New Setians are sent not just the reading list but the entire CrystalTablet, of course, and they receive the Scroll every other month.Page 130: Gini Graham Scott was a I° who joined the Temple underfalse pretenses, secretly planning to make a case-study of it for her personalprofit. When she was found out at a Temple Conclave at XemSet Mountain,she was kicked out of the Temple and put on a bus back to San Francisco.Her subsequent book omits mention of her deception and glosses over herhumiliating expulsion, of course, but works overtime to capitalize on someof the most intimate comments of Setians who had assumed they weretalking with her only as close, confidential friends.The Temple of Set did not reach its zenith at the end of the 1970s. Infact it reached a low at that time, as the policies of then-High Priest RonaldBarrett, coupled with the crises at the Set- IV Conclave had brought theTemple to a very precarious point. Since then it has steadily recovered, andis now at an all-time high where size, participation, sophistication, options,services, etc. are concerned.My position as “Grand Master Emeritus” is in the Temple’s Order of theTrapezoid, of course - and that Order is purring along just fine. I continueto be High Priest of Set and am not in the least “disenchanted” with theTemple of Set. [It does keep me on my toes, however.]In 1987 the Temple of Set was not curtailing anything. We have beendoing more than we ever have before. If anything we are suffering from“option overload” - too many ideas & desires without the sufficient time toactualize them all at once. Hence we are not at all in a state of“organizational disarray”, and our future is not “doubtful” at all. [Lyonswould have been correct to say that our future is “undetermined”, as theTemple continues to evolve so quickly and unpredictably that it is difficultto know exactly what it is going to be some years from now.]Page 133: As seen,” says Lyons, “most Satanists are frustrated peoplereacting against the banality and powerlessness of their lives.” Don’t knowwhat “Satanists” he was talking to, but I doubt they were Setians. If you’ve- 1386 -been to some Temple Conclaves, I think that you’ll agree that the hallmarkof our Initiates is life in the fast track, both exoteric and esoteric.Page 135: I have never written that “the governing principle of magic isto control people without their realizing how or why they are beingcontrolled”. That completely ignores Greater Black Magic, of course, and isonly a crude approximation of Lesser Black Magic. I would think Art coulddo better with his CT.Page 137: Neither the pre-1975 Church of Satan nor the post-1975Temple of Set has been a “failure”. Both bit off a very big bite to chew, andboth chewed it very well indeed. When you seek to “boldly go where no manhas gone before”, you meet your share of Klingons, Romulans, and tribbles,that’s all. Both institutions have profoundly touched the lives of all whohave come into contact with them - whether the association was a long oneor a short one. [Why, I wonder, is Lyons so frantic to pronounce Satanism a“failure”? He, after all, joined the Church of Satan too - and is stillsufficiently mesmerized by it to write yet another book about it. “Methinksthe lady doth protest too much. ”]927Well, I hadn’t intended to go into all this detail, but when I startedgoing through the Church of Satan & Temple of Set sections of the book, itbegan to mushroom and mushroom - and four pages later here I am. Sowhy did Art Lyons screw it up so much?I suppose it could be that he’s still under the old LaVey spell, which iscertainly a charming one. He and Anton have been good friends since 1968or so, and as only a peripheral member of the Church, Art was not directlytouched by the 1975 crisis. Anton grumps about the T.S. a lot. Where themisrepresentation of the Temple of Set is concerned, apparently Lyons waseither too lazy to check his final “facts” with me - or for whatever hisreasons he elected to do a bit of a hatchet job on us. Not a complete hatchetjob, for he made many complimentary statements about us as well - and setsome critical points straight, such as the business about the atrocious“Satanic child molestation” craze. As this Scroll goes to press, one of ourSan Francisco Adepts just telephoned to say that Lyons appeared on atelevision talk show and rose stalwartly to the defense of both the Church ofSatan and the Temple of Set as ethical institutions composed of decent,law-abiding people.So I am frankly confused. What gives, Art?927 Chapter #10.- 1387 -* * *#XV-3, June XXIV (1989)The new paperback edition of Satan Wants You by Arthur Lyons hasjust been published. Readers of the Scroll will recall that, when thehardcover edition of this book appeared last year, I praised Lyons for hisincisive exposure of the “Satanic crime hysteria” phenomenon - butproceeded to box him soundly about the ears for his substantiallyinaccurate discussion of the Temple of Set and the 1975 crisis of the Churchof Satan. A copy of my comments was sent to Art personally, and heindicated that he planned various changes in the paperback text as aconsequence.For this paperback edition Lyons indeed cleaned up a few of the moreconspicuous errors but simply chose to ignore the others - and added acouple of new ones, such as an inexcusably gullible paragraph on thefraudulent “Temple of Nepthys”. 928 He is obviously still bedazzled by theold Anton LaVey mystique, just as he was when he wrote his original TheSecond Coming: Satanism in America twenty years ago, and is clearlyreluctant to say anything to queer his continued welcome at CaliforniaStreet.It is a shame that, with so much that is so excellent about this book,Lyons persisted in cheapening it with LaVey-orchestrated petulance,turning its Church of Satan chapter into little more than a clone of BurtonWolfe’s gushing Devil’s Avenger and merely reciting the 6114 party lineabout the Temple of Set. Satan Wants You accordingly stays off theTemple’s reading list in favor of Lyons’ The Second Coming, which - while20 years’ dated - is still superior to its successor by virtue of its freedomfrom this distortion. As for the truth about the events which led to theChurch of Satan/Temple of Set crisis of 1975, it is easily available in TheChurch of Satan to anyone who is seriously interested in it.928 In the mid-1980s an expelled member of the Temple of Set attempted for atime toplagiarize its publications and sell them under the name of “Temple of Nepthys”.- 1388 -- 1389 -Appendix 147: Review - Cults That Kill by Larry Kahaner- by Michael A. Aquino VI°Scroll of Set #XIV-4, August XXIII (1988)Last October I received a letter from award-winning journalist LarryKahaner to the effect that he was writing a book about contemporaryAmerican Satanism and would appreciate some information concerning theTemple of Set. I provided him with a copy of the Crystal Tablet and someextracts from The Church of Satan, and during the next few months wecorresponded two or three times concerning questions that he had fromperusing this material.Then Kahaner’s research led him in other directions. In theIntroduction to CTK he states: “This book began as an investigation into thegrowing phenomenon of Satanism in America. It was to be a study ofSatanists, their beliefs and practices. As I interviewed more and morepeople living in this bizarre and mysterious world, however, what I foundled me in a different direction. I found a hidden society, much larger andmore disquieting than the world of Satanism alone, a place few peopleknow exists.”What Kahaner had run into is the phenomenon of occult-theme crimein the United States, which he found to extend far beyond what legitimateSatanists consider authentic Satanism. He expanded his research toembrace this subject, and Cults That Kill (New York: Warner Books, 1988)is the result.The book is in the form of a series of excerpts from interviewsconducted by Kahaner in person, by telephone, and by letter. Each chaptertreats a different subject, and the interview excerpts in that chapter speakto it. For example, in the chapter dealing with legitimate Satanism there arequotes from the Satanic Bible, the Crystal Tablet of Set, the Temple of Set’sinformational letter, Sandi Gallant, Dale Griffis, Pat Metoyer, and myself.Kahaner did not edit or distort any of the Temple of Set material, and thepicture that emerges of the Temple is accordingly as sophisticated,dignified, and complimentary as it deserves to be.This, I must say, is all we ask for in journalistic analysis: Let ourpolicies, programs, record, and literature speak for themselves! If this isallowed to happen, without distortion, then I will match the Temple of Setagainst any challenger or competitor - anywhere, anytime.The Temple of Set speaks for itself for about ten pages of this book - butthat’s enough. What we have to say there is in marked contrast to what- 1390 -Wiccans, Gallant- genre police, and other assorted actors in this strangemelodrama of the 1980s are grumbling and gasping about.And Kahaner, bless him, has found the most colorful rogues’ gallery of“authorities” since the album cover of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts ClubBand. Let’s introduce the stars:Officer Sandi Gallant, San Francisco Police Department: Needs nointroduction to Scroll readers at this point, surely. Cults That Kill aboundswith Gallant “expertise”. For instance:Some Satanists believe that with specific body parts they can use thepower contained therein. The head may contain the spirit, and the heart maycontain the soul. These are things that would allow them to be in control. It’sbeen said that they like to have a finger of the left hand. I don’t know exactlywhy the finger. I understand about the left and right paths, but why the finger?Who knows?[Lilith refuses to let me make the comment about this that I want sovery badly to make. Oh, all right!]How about this gem?:Some [Satanists] may look upon Satan in different ways too. Some mayrefer to him as Satan. Others, like the Temple of Set, may refer to him as Set,the ancient Egyptian god of the dead.Move over, Osiris.I’ve saved the quintessential Gallant quote for last:It’s taken me years to build up my credibility within my department assomeone who doesn’t go off halfcocked. They know that if I say something, it’snot off the top of my head. I’ve got documentation … Also, the most importantthing is that my boss knows that one belief is always on the top of my mind: Idon’t investigate religions, I investigate crimes.Indeed.Before leaving the subject of Sandi Gallant, I must mention that theS.F. bay area O.T.O., fearful about being raided or otherwise harassed byher, delegated one of its members to regularly visit her and brief her on itsactivities. Of course, one of the things the O.T.O. stresses [like Wicca] isthat it is not, repeat, not “Satanic”. Was the hat-in-hand effort worth it?States Gallant:- 1391 -The O.T.O. is another interesting group. They claim not to be Satanic.O.T.O. will claim to be ceremonial magick. I, however, would put them in withSatanic groups. They’re pagan-based, but pagans don’t want to claim them.Poor old outcast, Devil-worshipping O.T.O.!And if the O.T.O. hasn’t been treated to a Gallant/Pamfiloff midnightraid yet, they came close to it awhile back. Recounts Gallant:We found out where they were in Berkeley, and we drove over to seewhat was going on … We discovered that everything the O.T.O. does is“skyclad”, which means naked. Well, you’re not going to get me in there, butJerry [Gallant’s partner] says, “I am ready - just send me in the door.”Needless to say, we didn’t go, but we sat outside to see what was going on …Well, we didn’t see much. We saw them walk from a dilapidated housenext door to the church in their white robes. The only thing we saw was themholding something about the size of a basketball covered with a white sheetand carry it into the church. We sat there all night long in the pouring rainfornothing, absolutely nothing.O.K., Bill Heidrick929 , fess up! What sick, degenerate, perverted thingwere you guys doing with that basketball, anyway? [Under a sheet, no less -and all in the nude!]Alternating frequently with Sandi Gallant in Cults That Kill is the mostcontinuously horrified “occult cop” in the business, retired Ohio policeCaptain Dale Griffis. I first saw him on television during that famous ABC20/20 special on “Satanic crime” in May 1986. He was horrified then and isif anything even more horrified today. He is widely touted around thecountry as being an expert on Satanism almost as knowledgeable asGallant. I’m sure you will be interested in what he has to say:The use of blood in Satanic rituals is very important. According to thebeliefs, blood contains the life force. If you have it, you have power. That’swhythey drink it and pour it over themselves.So is sacrificing people. When you sacrifice someone, for the instant justbefore they die, they supposedly emit their life energy. That power, Satanistsbelieve, can be harnessed for their use. They believe babies are best becausebabies are pure; they haven’t sinned or been corrupted yet. They possess ahigher power than adults. When you sacrifice a baby, you get greater powerthan if you sacrificed an adult. One of the most prized possessions of aSatanist is a candle made from the fat of an unbaptized baby.929 Grand Treasurer General of the O.T.O. and longtime friend to the Temple ofSet.- 1392 -My initial impulse, like yours I am sure, is to laugh at such absurdnonsense. But what makes it not so funny is that people like Gallant andGriffis are lending the authority of the police badge to the kind of ravingsthat one would expect only from the fundamentalist lunatic fringe. Thatsame lunatic fringe, of course, has been quick to capitalize on the“authority” of such officials to justify their efforts to suppress, persecute,and hopefully exterminate New Age philosophies, Wicca, and above allSatanism.So Sandi Gallant and Dale Griffis aren’t funny at all. They aredangerous, unprofessional, and irresponsible. Many innocent people willsuffer harassment, discrimination, and personal tragedy because of them.Griffis is retired, and as a private citizen he cannot be held to publicaccount. Gallant continues to wear a badge. It is for this reason that wehave filed the formal complaint against her. 930In Cults That Kill you will also meet a few Wiccans, trilling their usualchorus about we-are-witches-not-Satanists. Like the O.T.O., most of the930 The San Francisco Police Commission’s findings were announced to an 11/22/90letter to me, quoted as follows:As a result of our investigation of your allegations that [Gallant] is keepingimproper intelligence files on you and your religion; that this same member isaccumulating negative information and not trying to present an objective picturein these files; that this same member improperly contacted your employer withconfidential information; that this same member has presented a defamatoryimage of your religion both on and off duty, we have preliminarily found thattheactions you complained of are improper under the rules and regulations of theSFPD. Accordingly our preliminary [later final] disposition of these allegationsis“Sustained”.The SFPC findings were all accepted without exception by the Chief of Police’sOffice.From there they went to the SFPD Management Control Division (MCD), which is incharge of recommending disciplinary or corrective action concerning SFPDofficers. TheMCD directed Gallant’s Lieutenant that she be formally counseled concerning hercollection and use of information, both on the job and in her secondaryoccupations (i.e.merchandising herself commercially as an “occult expert”). The MCD also directedherLieutenant to review and purge her files of any improper intelligenceinformation, i.e.any information that does not specifically relate to criminal activity. [Thisinstructiongutted her files of all of the religious, political, and social “intelligence”she had beencollecting.]Subsequently, as a result of our & other complaints, the San Francisco PoliceCommission instructed the SFPD to write a general order directing thatintelligence begathered and maintained only on strictly criminal activities.- 1393 -brighter Wiccans are beginning to realize that fundamentalist cult-busterscouldn’t care less about such subtle distinctions: All witches are suitable forthe stake. Comments Griffis:I know about white witchcraft and black witchcraft, but you can’t tell methat every once in a while a white witch doesn’t get a little taste of the powerhe or she has conjured and takes it just a step further.Other “experts” appearing in the book include Dr. Carl Raschke (aReligious Studies professor at the Methodist Church’s Denver University,who publishes vicious, distorted anti-Satanic articles throughfundamentalist cult-busting groups such as the Spiritual CounterfeitsProject); University of California history professor Jeffrey Russell (whoseshoddy “research” on Satanism I formally exposed at the University931 - butwho hasn’t the integrity to admit and correct his published errors); andCatholic priest James LeBar (who furtively circulated anti-Satanic hateliterature, assuming that we wouldn’t find out about him. We did, and Isent him that long list of recent child-sex court convictions of Catholicpriests from Scroll #XIV- 1 for his edification).In short, Cults That Kill is a book dramatizing the stark contrastbetween Satanism as it really is - and by that I emphatically and absolutelymean the Temple of Set and only the Temple of Set - and “criminalSatanism” as foolish, ignorant, and malicious people are trying sodesperately to portray it. And they trot out all sorts of sick, stupid criminalsto substantiate their witchhunt, just as the Nazis duly produced a“communist saboteur” for the Reichstag fire.Cults That Kill will sell largely because of the lively public interest inthe howlings of today’s Reichstag fire merchants. But I predict that thecontrast between that mentality and the substance of the Temple of Set,which author Kahaner has rigorously and carefully distinguished, will bethe beginning of the end of the current witch-hunt. The truth will out,despite the desperate efforts of suppression by those who fear and hate it.Buy this book. Read it. Remember it.931 Letter, M.A. Aquino to Jeffrey Russell with copies to Chancellor, UniversityofCalifornia Santa Barbara and Chairman, History Department, UCSB and Editor,DailyNexus (UCSB newspaper), January 19, 1987.- 1394 -- 1395 -Appendix 148: Review - Secret Life of a Satanist“And If You Believed The Devil’s Avenger,I’ve Got Something Else to Sell You .”- by Michael A. Aquino VI°Scroll of Set #XVI-5, October XXV (1990)Now available is The Secret Life of a Satanist: The AuthorizedBiography of Anton LaVey by Sharon “Blanche Barton” Densley. Or is itindeed by “Blanche Barton”, or is it rather a ghost-written autobiography byAnton himself, in the way that the 1974 Devil’s Avenger “by Burton Wolfe”may have been? Anton’s habit of hiding behind pseudonyms and pen-names, including those of living associates (such as John M. Kincaid duringthe days of the Church of Satan) is well-known, and once again - as in TheDevil’s Avenger - the writing style is virtually identical to Anton’s own. Iagain suspect we are looking at an autobiography released under Barton’sname to avoid an image of conspicuous narcissism - or at least a Bartonmanuscript so dictated/edited by Anton as to make the differencenegligible.Once again echoing TDA, SLOAS is simply a gush of fawn-&-tremblingadoration of Anton from cover to cover. Reading this book is rather likedrinking an entire bottle of pancake syrup straight - O.K. if you have acompulsive sweet tooth, but a bit much otherwise.Somewhere underneath the goo the portrait of a very talented andeccentric individual can be uncovered. Whatever else one may say abouthim, no one can accuse Anton Szandor LaVey of being uninteresting. He setout early in life to construct his personality and lifestyle as a kind of MarvelComics magazine come to life, and has successfully convinced at least partof society that even his most absurd claims are all quite true. Well, whynot? Life would be duller without an occasional Zsa Zsa Gabor to tweakpolite society’s nose. And as long as Anton LaVey harmed no one - andindeed enchanted onlookers with his mixture of stylish theatre andshudderingly noir ideology - one could applaud him.Underneath the Mardi Gras mask, moreover, as I have detailed in TheChurch of Satan, was a brilliant mind at odds with a society whose moralhypocrisy it could not accept. If he could not change that society, it wasAnton’s particular genius to create an artificial, Howard Hughes-likecocoon around himself so that he could at least endure it - and occasionallygive it a swift kick in the derriere.- 1396 -Anton LaVey succeeded a bit too well, as by the early 1970s he foundhimself the head of a nationwide church whose members expected him tolead, teach, and represent them as a religious institution dedicated to theSatan he had so fervently invoked first in hundreds of personal ceremoniesand then in his Satanic Bible. For a time he rose to this responsibility, andthereby attained his greatest dignity.In 1975, however, under the impression that the reverence in which hewas held was merely admiration for his own personality, he tried toprostitute the Church of Satan into a mere carnival scam by selling theSatanic Priesthood and all higher degrees for cash. When the nationalmembership indignantly rejected such corruption of the Satanic religion,Anton responded by denying Satan and his own High Priesthood except asfigures of speech for his own convenience - whereupon the Church of Satandisintegrated as an organization overnight, and re-formed, a short timelater, as the Temple of Set.Since then we have been treated to the grotesque, pathetic, andcontemptible spectacle of an Anton LaVey trying vaguely and vainly to usethe old spells to recreate the magic he lost, yet failing again and again. Firsthe promoted a handful of sycophants remaining wistfully at his feet to“priests” and “magisters”. Then he bombarded anyone who would listenwith claims that the Church of Satan still existed, and indeed was larger andmore awesome than ever.SLOAS shovels similar manure concerning a C/S “Council of Nine” and“Order of the Trapezoid”, which Anton claims are as functional today as in1966.And the absurd Marilyn Monroe-affair story is trotted out again,despite its exposure and discrediting years ago by MM confidante RobertSlatzer and MM agent Harry Lipton. 932 [Just the other evening a RollingStone reporter mentioned to me that he had located and interviewed themanager of the Mayan Theater at the alleged time, who also confirmed thatMM had never had anything to do with it, as a stripper or otherwise, asAnton alleges. 933 ]Indeed not only is Anton’s attempted prostitution of the Church ofSatan in 1975 missing from SLOAS, but so is the entire history of thatorganization from the moment that it expanded past the original small SanFrancisco group. And make no mistake about it; Anton LaVey became a932 Chapter #2.933 Appendix #151.- 1397 -person of consequence not because he was a Mardi Gras clown in SanFrancisco, but because he was High Priest of an active and influentialnationwide church - the Church of Satan - and because he had the prideand the courage to claim authority as Satan’s personal Exarch on Earth.If the Church of Satan is missing from SLOAS, so is the Devil himself.Satan is not even mentioned at all - which is not surprising, since Antonrenounced him in 1975 and since then has merely bandied the terms“Satan”, “Satanic”, and “Satanism” about as though, like Humpty-Dumpty,they endorse whatever kinky fetish he has embraced at the moment. Is thePrince of Darkness of Milton, Dante, and Blake now merely a trademark forblow-up sex dolls, underwear collections, and girlie hot- water bottles (oneof which is tucked under Anton’s arm on the cover of SLOAS)? I doubt it.The hundreds of Satanists who built, operated, and defended theChurch of Satan throughout the decade of its existence - often at great riskand sacrifice to themselves, must shudder with disgust at such degradationof all that was so sacred to them. None of the Church’s Grotto Leaders,Regional Agents, and Priesthood across the country are even mentioned byname in SLOAS, which effectively illustrates Anton’s appreciation for theirdedication.Equally offensive is SLOAS’ treatment of Diane LaVey, Anton’s once-acknowledged wife, who was at least as responsible for the creation andfurtherance of the Church of Satan as he was - and, on a day-to-day basis,was its chief administrator for the entire ten years. After the disaster of1975 she remained loyally at her husband’s side, doing whatever she couldto shelter him and to salvage something from the wreckage he had broughtdown around them. She raised their daughters Karla and Zeenaconscientiously and lovingly, and she adored him so transparently as totouch everyone who saw them together.As far as SLOAS is concerned, Diane might scarcely have existed at allsave as a slightly more animate decoration than the sex-mannequins in the6114 California Street basement. In the book’s photo section are 21 clear,crisp, and ego-flattering photos of Anton himself - and only one of Diane:by herself, faded, fuzzy, and the least flattering I have ever seen [although itis hard for Diane not to look pretty]. Hundreds of gorgeous, studio-qualityphotos of Diane exist, such as those taken by Time photographers Jack &Betty Cheetham for their Occult Beauties portfolio. And not only is Dianenot given the courtesy of a joint photo with Anton, but even the captionmerely identifies her as “Diane, LaVey’s companion of 24 years”.- 1398 -In one small paragraph SLOAS whines that on July 18, 1984 Anton wassummoned to court and served a restraining order brought against him byDiane. Indignantly he complained to Karla, saying that he “wasn’t going tostand for it, that he had performed his magic”, etc. SLOAS readers mightfeel sorry for poor Anton unless they happened to read the Sacramento Beeof 9/22/88:All hell broke loose between the couple in 1984, when Diane moved outof LaVey’s California Street house, claiming LaVey had beaten her. Hegartyalleged in her lawsuit that LaVey applied a hammerlock to her neck, lifted heroff the ground, and rendered her unconscious …After Diane and Anton formally began the Church of Satan, Antonbecame the high priest of the order and Diane the office manager. Althoughnever married to Anton, Diane used the name “LaVey”. Her suit contends thatthey acted as husband and wife for over two decades. But the relationshipsoured after two decades. In 1985 LaVey agreed to have separate entrancesand facilities built in the couple’s house so he and Diane wouldn’t have to seeeach other. Diane charged that those modifications were never added to thehouse, and consequently she never returned.“I pounded out the Satanic Bible on a $29 typewriter,” said Diane. “Iedited it. I added to it. I ran the Church with Anton. Then he left me withnothing.“Anton refused to support me. For four years I have been scrambling tosurvive, doing temporary office work. I could hardly put my skills at Satanicrituals on a resume.”Diane left LaVey in 1984 to escape his alleged physical abuse. She saysshe fled in fear of her life after she was beaten and choked. She won a partialproperty settlement in 1985 but claims that LaVey reneged on it …Following the departure of Diane it at first seemed that daughters Karlaand Zeena would take her place attempting to prop up the fake image of aflourishing Church of Satan that Anton has tried so emphatically to sellsince 1975. Karla, however, has moved on to a secular professional career ofher own. And Zeena, while devoted to her father, is evidently not cynicalenough to convincingly perpetuate the fraud.Enter “Blanche Barton”, behind whose skirts Anton has retreated eversince. The extent to which she also controls Karla and/or Zeena by virtue ofher influence over their father is not clear but will be, I expect, sooner orlater.In SLOAS Anton ridicules the occasional rumors of his illness or death.He misses the point. The High Priest of the Church of Satan died in 1975.That Anton Szandor LaVey was a hero, a genius, and a man who walked- 1399 -with the very Prince of Darkness himself. It was one of the greatestexperiences of my life to know him.The Anton LaVey of SLOAS is someone else whom I don’t know at all.And, the more I learn about him, the less I want to know him.- 1400 -- 1401 -Appendix 149: Letter to Geraldo Rivera(prior to his “Satanism Special”)- from Michael A. Aquino VI°October 15, XXIII (1988)I hope that you will indeed use this October 25 broadcast to clear upmisinformation concerning contemporary Satanism. The preposterousstereotypes projected by the religious lunatic fringe are already largelydiscredited among people who have taken the time to examine the facts. Aswith any other craze, it is simply a question of time until the rest of thepublic realizes the extent of the distortions and malicious defamationswhich have occurred, and shrugs off the fad in disgust.Your broadcast can be the spearhead of this exposé - or it can be one ofthe last efforts to prop up an already moribund hate-campaign. I hope thatyou will have the courage and the journalistic integrity to make it theformer.In your previous letter to me, you said that you would be asking myopinions concerning Sean Sellers and Mike Warnke.According to published accounts in the local media at the time of hiscrime, and per a televised interview he gave to a Texas television stationseveral months ago, there is no indication that Sean Sellers was ever partof an organized Satanic group which encouraged or orchestrated themurders of which he was convicted.Sellers has stated that he was “trained” into Satanism by playing“Dungeons and Dragons”. This makes about as much sense as being“trained” into Satanism by seeing a horror movie. Children and adolescentshabitually play any number of fantasy games while they grow up. I’mcertain young Jerry Rivers934 did as well. Did they warp your soul or enslaveyou to the Devil? [Well, they may have prompted you to become anattorney, which is almost as bad.]Sellers has stated that, after being sucked into Satanism via “D&D”, he“became a vampire and had a craving for blood”. Obviously he is not avampire, nor can humans drink blood without getting violently sick. Whyshould his claims about Satanic involvement be any more credible thanthose about his being Count Dracula?Sellers has stated that “every Satanist uses drugs”. In fact the Church ofSatan and Temple of Set have consistently and adamantly insisted that934 Geraldo Rivera’s real name.- 1402 -their members stay clear of illegal drugs. The occasional violator, whendiscovered, has been expelled unless it has been verified that he or she isunder corrective medical treatment.As a minor, Sellers was presumably brought up as a member of aconventional church which, together with his parents and school, assumedresponsibility for his moral instruction and emotional development. If areligion is to be blamed for the murders that he committed, it stands toreason that it should be the one which indoctrinated him throughouthis childhood, not one with which he had no formal connection whatever.While, like “Todd”, “Sam”, and “Kurt” on your 10/6/88 daytime show,Sellers spins stories of a massive and clandestine “Satanic underground”,the same objection arises that applies to all the other “accounts” of thisnature - including that of the equally-pathetic “ex-Satanist Elaine” on your11/19/87 daytime show. Despite all the horrendous crimes in which thesepeople claim to have been involved, and the long associations they claimwith the many other people in the cults in question, no other member ofany such cult has ever been identified or prosecuted. Nor have anyof the “escaped ex-Satanists” ever been prosecuted for the crime orgies inwhich they say they were involved (usually as leaders).As a Satanist for the last twenty years, I am well familiar with the loreand symbolism of the religion in its many ritual and ceremonialapplications. If any of these “ex-Satanists” were recounting actual Satanicactivities, I would recognize the terminology, the settings, and theprocedures. Not one of them has demonstrated knowledge beyond thecomic-book level. [I exposed one such “ex-Satanist” on the Oprah WinfreyShow in just this way.]If a cult or gang were engaged in such serious crimes as regular humansacrifice (=murder), I seriously doubt that any participant would be allowedto just drop out and waltz into the talk-show circuit. Despite your studiogimmicks such as screens and masked faces, any such gang would havefirsthand knowledge of a disaffected member from the moment he or sheceased cooperating. Retaliation would presumably be immediate. Yet thereis no evidence that any of these “ex-Satanists” ever had any difficultybowing out of a “murder ring”.I see Sellers as no different from any other wrongdoer who is anxious toproject the responsibility for his deeds on to something - anything -besides himself. “The Devil made me do it” is the first act in this cliché,soft-shoe routine. The second act is being Born Again, as per Susan Atkins and- 1403 -Charles Colson. [If you’ve already been reBorn once, as Jimmy Swaggartand Jim Bakker, I guess you’ve got to go round a second time.]My views concerning Mike Warnke are much the same as thoseconcerning Sellers, save that Warnke isn’t a convicted murderer.Since he first surfaced in 1972 as star of Morris Cerullo’s traveling“Witch Wagon” revivalist road show, Warnke’s claims about his “Satanic”past have come across like so much snake oil. 935 Two evenings ago Ilistened to an extensive taped interview given by Warnke in which heclaimed to have been a leader in a 1,500-strong Devil-cult in the LosAngeles area. The Church of Satan had members all over Los Angeles. Ifany other Satanist group of this size, involved in either criminal or non-criminal activities, had existed, we would have certainly known about it.There is no indication that any of the crimes alleged to have beenperpetrated by this large cult ever took place, or that anyone from it wasever identified or arrested, or that Warnke himself was arrested for havingbeen a leader in it, or that he has ever suffered so much as a wart for havingmade a profession for himself writing books and making mediaappearances about it. His book The Satan Seller talks horrifically about thiscult, but once again includes not one specific item of information which canbe used to verify its existence.You already have the extensive documentation on the other subjects ofyour show which I have provided you by mail. Certainly you have enoughdata to know that the “criminal conspiracy” image of Satanism projected byreligious hate-groups is simply wrong - not in a few respects but in everyrespect.Satanism is a legitimate religion which has evolved through the yearsinto a respectable, creative, and positive alternative for thoughtfulindividuals. We do not claim it is suitable for everyone, but we think itdeserves to be judged on its own merits - not to be persecuted out ofexistence by bigots who fear that it might look more attractive than thealternatives in which they have an emotional or financial stake. Are yougoing to suppress the truth about this, or are you going to reveal it?935 The IRS agrees. See Chapter #23.- 1404 -- 1405 -Appendix 150: Letter, Zeena [LaVey] to Michael AquinoRADIO WEREWOLFMinistry of Propaganda & Public Enlightenment30 December 1990/XXV ASDear Dr. Aquino:With the dawning of a new year, I felt this to be an ideal time tocommunicate some thoughts to you that I trust shall bring about a newawareness in many regards.First of all, you should be aware that as of 30 April, 1990 (Anno XXV) Iofficially and ritually ended my position as Church of Satan representative-defender and daughter of Anton LaVey. This ritual brought all contactbetween myself and the Church of Satan, including my unfather, to acomplete cessation. Although I felt it my responsibility as a sincereadvocate of the unnamable forces we experience to attempt to fight off theJudeo-Christian hysteria of the ’80s, I became too disgusted with theorganization and the individual I was foolishly standing in for to continuethis charade in “good” conscience.While I have no regrets in my battle with the forces of ignorance, andmy own unswerving dedication to my religion has only grown, I could nolonger defend such an ungrateful and unworthy individual as the so-calledBlack Pope.I feel it is only just that I give credit where credit is due, andacknowledge that you have been quite correct about many aspects of themodus operandi of the Church of Satan’s fearless leader. Essentially, he is acoward and could not possibly deal with the hostility that we have had toencounter in publicly defending our beliefs. Despite this repellent lack ofwarrior spirit or pride on his part, he was filled, and still is, with pettyjealous criticism of my efforts. This was easy for him to do from the safevantage point of the comfortable and risk-free easy chair we know he haslived in for decades.Besides my public appearances, I have also made many valuable andunprecedented contacts with police and law enforcement officials in theinterest of providing more enlightened treatment of Satanists everywhere.Of course, the mighty “High Priest” succeeded in sabotaging these efforts tohis own disadvantage, in addition to the disadvantage of all practicingmagicians. I believe he is, through his ostrich-in-the-sand stance, a- 1406 -detriment to any attempt at halting the scapegoat fever that has entered allof “our” private lives. Indeed, his irresponsible laziness has repeatedly andignorantly endangered my life as well as the lives of many who weremisguided enough to support him.The most recent and blatant example of this may be found in thepublication of the absurd catalogue of lies entitled Secret Life of a Satanistby (as told to) Blanche Barton. This fluffy PR release masquerading as abook included, with typical irresponsibility, a photo of my son without everseeking his or my permission. Like all of the self-serving bullshit printed inthis volume, the malignant use of an innocent child to buttress a flaggingreputation and self-esteem is a new low point in a career already dottedwith depths. For your information, despite Barton’s claim, Anton LaVey hasnever given “tutelage” of any sort to his grandson. In fact my son wasshocked and angered at being hypocritically exploited by his grandfather’spathetic effort to portray himself as a loving family man.Furthermore, despite the fact that this biography was printed long aftermy resignation, Barton knowingly lied by perpetuating the idea that I haveanything at all to do with CoS and its founder. If Barton chooses to spinother falsehoods about her subject’s life, that’s fine, but she has crossed theline by including my son and myself. You and I are both aware of thecountless untruths contained in this book, but I felt you should beilluminated on points relating to myself (at least).Another fact conveniently not included is the common knowledge thatas the co-director of the Werewolf Order, I have paved a unique path of myown inspired by the Western European magical tradition. These veryEuropean magical traditions, which I have always maintained as my own,are of more personal importance to me than the largely Eastern andnegative Judæo-Christian imagery still so boringly peddled by the CoS. Inthe desire to appeal to the masses, Barton’s book makes it glaringly clearthat the real motive of the Church of Satan is to attract cash from“economic power brokers”; what other reason could justify the sickeninglyrepetitive flattery she (he) extends to Zionism, Bolshevism, and the state ofIsrael while safely negating any Norse or Teutonic mythology?Of course the reason Barton prefers to present me as loyal daughterand #1 fan is to obscure the fact that my real activities in the world are nolonger connected to her mentor. The Werewolf Order is and always hasbeen a sovereign entity. Those participants in our magical and publicactivities are now bound to a state of strict neutrality. Far from wishing tocontinue the pointless bickering and infighting, I speak for myself and the- 1407 -Werewolf Order in declaring that there is no use for these hollowanimosities which can, after all, be no part of a truly initiated world view.Under the ægis of Radio Werewolf, my music, writings, videos, andperformances are expressions of my personal magical vision. Any otherclaim concerning my activities is purely to feed the parasitic hunger of thatwhich you have dubbed “the Kennel”.While we may find some theological differences in our approach, Iknow you are sincere in your beliefs and have continued to publicly defendthem, for which I congratulate you. Laying aside these differences, I’m sureyou can comprehend the deeper and more intangible aspects of all of this.My unfather should never have carelessly tampered with the authenticforces of darkness that he now idiotically believes are his own creation. Infact, many times he has implied that he regrets opening the “Pandora’s box”of Satanism. I have seen firsthand what his insincere and cynical approachto these nameless cthonic powers can do to one shaky and uncertain ego.I was born a Satanist; my unfather was raised in the mundane world ofhumankind where he remains. He unwittingly served as the agent of thetrue daemonic energy needed to sire me as a genuine magical child. I havenever seen any evidence that he honestly believes in the force whom he hasfor so long exploited as a “good gimmick”. Nevertheless he did succeed inattracting the ideal sorceress needed for my conception. My mother, anatural magician as incarnation of Diana the Huntress, was the drivingforce of the most positive aspects of the Church of Satan. As you are aware,her design of many of the magical insignias of the Church, herorganizational and administrative abilities, her uncredited contributions tothe Satanic Bible and Rituals, and her charisma are but some of theelements that proved her to be the backbone of what was once a vital entity.As duality is a necessary dynamic in any form of progress, it ismathematically easy to see that when one portion of the duality is repelled,the other collapses into passivity. I am the living essence of this particularduality maintained at its peak.In light of all of the factors herein, I also officially severed my givensurname and now prefer to be known only as Zeena. As I feel naturallyaristocratic, I also have no need for the empty titles of Magistra or HighPriestess that have been bandied about and fought over.Anton LaVey has degraded his own claimed religion, his family, hissupporters too often and too ignorantly. He created a monster in me, forperhaps I am too serious about all this for the likes of the High Priest whowould prefer movie stars and “expensive” restaurants to any meaningful- 1408 -magical experience. In the end the “balance factor” he smugly refers to willbe his ultimate undoing, for the cosmic cards are stacked against him. Weshall see where this monster leads.My last word on this tiresome subject relates to the film SunsetBoulevard. You will recall the aging silent star portrayed by GloriaSwanson. Indeed LaVey has shown himself to be the Norma Desmond ofSatanism, lost in decadent, nostalgic reverie, glaring into the camera onelast time, announcing, “I’m ready for my close-up now, Mr. Bougas.” Tangomusic up. Fade to black.I close this in hopes of ending any lingering antagonisms between us,and to leave this psychic vampire behind us. By imparting this to you, Itrust it will be of service to all dedicated travelers of the Left-Hand Path.May this letter bring a long-standing, unresolved chord to its end with bestwishes for the coming new year.In the Promethean flame,Zeena- 1409 -Appendix 151: “Sympathy for the Devil”- by Lawrence WrightRolling Stone #612, September 5, 1991Is the Devil real? This certainly looks like the Evil One himself gettingout of a black Jaguar and coming through the glass doors of a restaurantwith a blonde on his arm. It’s an interesting proposition and one that, afterall, millions of Americans believe: Satan lives, and his real-life incarnationis the person of Anton Szandor LaVey. His devilish appearance iscultivated, of course: the shaved head; the black slacks, black shirt andascot, black leather jacket and black fisherman’s cap; the Leninesquegoatee, still shimmeringly black, although LaVey is now sixty-one years old;and the tiny gold ear loop in his left lobe. That much, however, woulddescribe most of the leftover beatniks still wandering around San Francisco.No, there’s definitely something more, something innately sinister aboutthis man.His ears, you notice, are slightly pointed, and when he doffs his cap,you see his head is as well. He has a peculiar walk - a splayfoot, simianshuffle he says he picked up during his days in the circus and the carnival.Pale skin, which you would expect in a man who never sees the sun, butunnaturally youthful and lightly flecked with freckles. A gap-toothed smilethat is missing an upper-left incisor. Amber eyes that scarcely look human -more like the eyes of a big cat, with a cat’s sleepy intensity and implacableindifference. It is a wicked face, which is to say that it is charming, defiant,jaded, beguiling, humorous, bitter, knowing, and even a bit insouciant.How else would the Devil appear?LaVey’s reputation as the Devil incarnate began with his establishmentof the Church of Satan, in San Francisco in 1966, and was enlarged throughhis writings - most notably The Satanic Bible, which was published in 1969and has sold more than 600,000 copies through thirty printings. It was thisbook - a romantic celebration of indulgence, vengeance and existentialdoubt - that earned him the reputation among many religious believers asthe “evilest man in the world”. It also made him a dark hero to thedisaffected, the alienated, the marginal personalities for whom hisphilosophy rang chords of recognition and identity.“Anton LaVey is the pivotal figure in the growth and dissemination ofSatanic theology in America - he is the Saint Paul of Satanism, says Dr. CarlRaschke, author of Painted Black, which surveys the spread of Satanicactivity amid the young, and the phenomenal rise in reported cases of ritual- 1410 -abuse. And yet, as LaVey points out, “I’ve never presented myself as havingspoken directly to Satan or God or being in touch with any sort of divinityor having any sort of spiritual mandate. 936 I just feel that what I’m doing ispart of my nature.”Reviled as a despoiler of youth, dismissed as a con man and a carnytrickster, pursued by thrill seekers and Bible-thumpers and occult weirdoes,LaVey has become increasingly reclusive over the years. Indeed he is oftenrumored to have died long ago. 937 His church, which once boasted “grottos”in many major cities in the country, is now largely disbanded. During thesixties LaVey fashioned himself into an archetype of our depravedunconscious; he hobnobbed with movie stars and boasted of affairs withMarilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield; he was our libido let out of its cage;he was the Black Pope, raging and blaspheming and flaunting our taboos.Back then Satanism was new and shocking, and LaVey was its mostconspicuous practitioner. The post office would deliver mail to himaddressed only to “Satan”.Now, in the nineties, Satanic cults are springing up, it seems, in everylittle township and crossroads in America. Rock groups openly worship theDevil. Police departments all over the country are coping with rumors ofhuman sacrifice and hospitals with survivors of ritual abuse. The signs ofsatanic activity can be found not only in the graffiti on subway trains but inthe growing number of teenage suicides and actual cases of ritual murder.Meanwhile the spiritual father of this movement has retired to his gloomyhouse in the Richmond district of San Francisco, where he lives a self-"},{"pageContent":"consciously ascetic life, surrounded by his books, weapons, and keyboards;by his pets and magical artifacts; and by Blanche Barton, his Boswell andomnipresent blonde companion.I had read increasingly sketchy reports about LaVey’s existence andwondered whether he was sick, or in hiding, or even if, in some secretfashion, he was reformed. I suppose I hoped for that. He has made a careerout of exploring the shadows of the human psyche. “I am all that is vile,reprehensible and evil in the world,” he has boasted. “I am people’s worstnightmares.” Despite the absurdity of the claim, I felt more than a littleanxiety about our meeting. After all, the danger that LaVey represents tosociety is not who he is but who we are.“What dressing would you like on your salad?” the waiter enquired.936 Contradicted abundantly and repeatedly as documented herein.937 I for one never heard this rumor, but apparently Anton affected it “as arumor”.- 1411 -“Blue cheese,” I said.LaVey and Barton exchanged a look, then returned to their menus.Unknowingly I had just failed the LaVey salad-dressing test. According toThe Satanic Witch, his guide for lovelorn sorceresses, “dominant,masculine archetypes [like LaVey] prefer sweet dressings, such as French,Russian, Thousand Island” because the smell resembles the odor of awoman’s sexual organs. Blue cheese, on the other hand, is “reminiscent of alocker full of well-worn jockstraps”. It is really suitable only for wimps andsubmissive females. LaVey ordered the twenty-two-ounce porterhousesteak, rare.We were talking about violence and the corruption of art, which LaVeyblames on television. “But a lot of what has been unleashed is because ofthe Church of Satan,” said Barton, a plump and intensely pale youngwoman with little spit curls poking out from under her blue pillbox hat - asort of blond Betty Boop but with a Phi Beta Kappa pin on her dress.LaVey agreed: “I promoted the idea where everybody is a god. That’sthe Pandora’s box I’m partly responsible for opening. I helped create thisbig-shot-ism in everybody.”“And are you glad you opened Pandora’s box?” I asked, innocentlyenjoying my salad.“Yeah, because things have to get worse before they can get better,”said LaVey. “But I think we’ve already reached the lowest level of artisticexpression as a result of this newfound sovereignty in every man.” Althoughhe spoke quietly, a terrible cloud had come over his face. “Here we’re reallydealing with the ‘dignity’ of the human animal. I find more dignity in themovement of a fish, the shape of a horse …”He was off on one of his misanthropic rants. I would hear that themeplayed again and again over the two weeks we would spend dining togetherand hanging around the parlor of his famous black house. During thosesessions, which lasted until I staggered away in exhaustion, usually aroundfour in the morning, I often wondered what it was that had caused him tobecome so alienated from the human race. I thought if I could get to thebottom of LaVey’s rage, then I would find some great truth about thehuman need to pursue evil. Later I would realize that the notion that onecould find truth and perhaps even salvation through the exploration ofrepressed human needs was itself a Satanic idea - perhaps the ultimateSatanic idea.“I actually have more respect for vegetables than I do for people - I hateto even leave a pea on my plate,” LaVey said as he pronged one with his- 1412 -fork. “This little pea died for me. I know I’m beginning to sound like AlbertSchweitzer, but for this pea to be able to grow and fulfill its purpose on theplanet: that’s more than most humans ever accomplish.”“Do you believe peas have souls?” I asked.“Well, I wouldn’t use the word ‘soul’, but I do believe there are livingentities beyond what we normally understand. Anything can have lifebestowed upon it - a car, a good, faithful car; a typewriter; a house,certainly, becomes a living entity. Who can say these objects are not alive?”With that, the pea moved on to its final reward.“I’ve always been fascinated by the underbelly of humanity,” LaVey toldme in one of our early-morning discourses in his purple parlor. He wassitting in his armchair, beside a bookcase predictably filled with obscureoccult literature, but there were also a number of coffee-table books onHollywood, biographies of Marilyn Monroe, books on circus and carnivallore. I noticed Yeats’ Memoirs, as well as several rare books by one of myfavorite authors, Ben Hecht. Also The Complete Jack the Ripper, Eros andEvil, and My Father by Maria Rasputina, which was inscribed “Happywinter solstice to my father, Love, Karla”.On the mantel above the fake fireplace [it was actually a secret entranceto a ritual chamber938 ] were pictures of his daughters Karla and Zeena.Karla is like her father, with black hair and humorous black eyes. “I’vealways been conspicuous,” she confessed when we met. “Like my teacherswould tell us to write a story about our pets, and I would write about my pettarantula and the leopard who slept in my bed. We were really like theAddams family.” Karla is now a realtor in Marin County and an occasionallecturer on witchcraft.Zeena, LaVey’s younger daughter, is an exotic, pale blonde who hasbecome a notorious spokesperson for Satanism in her own right. She hasappeared on a number of talk shows, usually with her boyfriend NikolasSchreck, a member of the band Radio Werewolf. “Zeena is trying to gainrecognition,” LaVey told me with obvious mixed feelings. She feels she hasa legacy to gain. I think she’s got a father fixation.”There were no windows in this parlor. The only light came from what Isupposed to be a twenty-five-watt bulb in the lamp behind LaVey’s chair.He claims to be photophobic, one of his many vampiric qualities, whichinclude an allergy to garlic. When he reads, even in this light, he wears apair of bifocal sunglasses. Beside him, on one side of his chair, were his938 Actually to the Den of Iniquity (which, to be sure, is a type of ritualchamber).- 1413 -crystal ball and bullwhip; on the other, a stuffed armadillo and a machinegun. “I guess,” LaVey said, “I’ve lived a sort of noir existence since I was akid.”He was born, he said, Anton Szandor LaVey, on April 11th, 1930, inChicago, to Joe and Augusta LaVey - although even these initial details havebeen the subject of some dispute. [There is no such name as LaVey listed inthe Cook County birth records; however, there was a Howard Stanton Leveyborn on that day to parents Mike and Gertrude.]He had what he called a “subjective childhood”. His parents were “verynormal”, with no interest in the dark side: “The story of my father’s life wasto blend into the woodwork. My mother was the same way. They were veryparanoid about the neighbors and what people thought of them. In a way itwas good. I was allowed to take my own lead. In that sense, I couldn’t havechosen better parents.”His religious background was “very iconoclastic and extremelypermissive,” he said. “My own family were nonparticipants. I was neverpushed into a religious formula. The only thing I ever heard about religionwas: ‘Another name for God is nature.’ We did have relatives who wereChristian and Jewish. I had an aunt who was a Christian Scientist and anatheist uncle. You could say I grew up a second-generation nonbeliever orcynic.”According to LaVey, most Satanists are stigmatized as youths. When Iasked him about the stigmas of his own childhood, he spoke vaguely abouthis unpopularity with other kids and his inability to dance. “My life wasn’tawful - my only stigma was up here,” he said, pointing at his face. “I wasodd-looking. By today’s standards I would have looked fine, but in 1939 Iwas not cute. I was certainly not a Van Johnson or a John Wayne.” He didtalk about his horror of going to gym with the other boys, which was sogreat that he managed to get a doctor’s excuse to avoid it. He said he spenthis gym periods in the clinic eyeing the sexy school nurse.Frankly these did not seem like experiences so traumatic that theywould catapult a person into Satanism. I was still groping for some tellingincident in LaVey’s childhood as I read the manuscript of Barton’sauthorized biography of him, The Secret Life of a Satanist (since publishedby Feral House). There I ran across this passage: “Had tail removed. Extravertebra removed near the end of Tony’s spine which formed a prehensiletail, a caudal appendage, which seems to occur about 1 in every 100,000births.”“You had a tail?”- 1414 -“Yeah. I had it removed when I was thirteen or fourteen, under verypainful circumstances.”“Don’t you think that might have been stigmatizing?”“I never thought about it,” said LaVey, “although it really wasprofoundly disruptive to everything I did. I couldn’t sit straight in a chairbecause it would get inflamed. Several times it had to be lanced anddrained. The last time it happened we were camping on rocky terrain. Irolled around and must have banged it. Next day it started itching. Twodays later it really flared up.” It was wartime, and there was a shortage ofhospital rooms and anesthesia. He said he was operated on, on a gurney inthe hospital hallway, with a local anesthetic that was not very effective. Herecalled biting through the rubber cover of his pillow.World War II was in many ways a thrilling period in LaVey’s life. Hewould wear military outfits to school, and occasionally he got to go onsubmarine patrols in a boat owned by his uncle, who had been recruited bythe Coast Guard Reserve. “The Second World War and its permissivenesswere not lost on me,” LaVey said Prurience was the order of the day.”He had already experienced what he would later term an E.C.I. (forErotic Crystallization Inertia) when he was five years old A girl at a birthdayparty invited him into her room. When her mother suddenly came to findthem, the little girl was so upset she peed in her pants. “The E.C.I. is thesplit second of sexual awakening,” LaVey explained. “A switch goes oninside.” After that, the sight of women urinating became a particular fetishfor LaVey. He associated it especially with carnivals, because that was aplace where girls became giddy and excited on rides; it felt like a lustfulenvironment.When he was eleven, he was earning money picking up bottles aroundan outdoor dance pavilion, and he discovered a hole under the ladies’restroom. “Tony made sure he was front and center whenever he spied aninteresting woman going to relieve herself,” Barton notes.When he was sixteen, he experienced another E.C.I. He was at a party;some of the kids were wrestling, and a girl’s dress was hiked up so thatLaVey could see her plump thighs and pale skin. She was a blonde. “Shewas just another schoolgirl,” LaVey said. “I wasn’t even interested in her.”But forever after blondes were it for him - an unending source of love andtrouble.We had moved into the kitchen, where LaVey kept his eight keyboards,his two house cats and his pet boa constrictor, Boaz. Music has always beenat the center of LaVey’s life and of his magic as well. “I play kitsch music -- 1415 -bombastic, schmaltzy, corny - the kind of music you hear in the backgroundof cartoons” he said unapologetically as he took a seat inside his nest ofsynthesizers and samplers.“Satanic music is not heavy-metal rock & roll,” he said. In his opinion,the music of supposed Satanic groups such as AC/DC and Slayer is notreally occult, because millions of people hear their songs on records and inconcerts. What is really occult is what no one ever listens to anymore: songsthat were popular but now are long forgotten, such as “Telstar” and “Yes,We Have No Bananas”. LaVey keeps a list of such lost songs. He believesthat by playing them, he releases their power.“Music is a magical tool, a universal language,” he said “If you wanted itto rain, for instance, you could play every song with rain in the title. If noone else is playing those songs, there is still a certain charge in them. Itmight just rain.”That sounded pretty tame to me, although LaVey has claimed in thepast that he went cuckoo on the keyboards one night and caused the 1985earthquake in Mexico City.His musical career began, LaVey said, at the age of five, when he wentinto a music store with his mother and spontaneously picked out a tune ona harp. Soon he was studying violin, then drums and oboe. By the time hewas fifteen, he said, he was sufficiently accomplished to play second oboewith the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra. [According to the San FranciscoPerforming Arts Library, there was no such orchestra in 1945. The balletemployed the local symphony for its performances, and none of the threeoboists was named LaVey or Levey.]The kitchen was painted black, with fiendish murals on the walls Therewas a small hum of electricity when LaVey turned on his synthesizers,which aroused Boaz in his lighted box on the kitchen table. LaVey himselfbecame visibly energized. His life story resumed, this time set to music.He began with “The Gladiator’s Entry”, the traditional opening song ofthe circus, played with a wheezing calliope sound. LaVey’s legend, as he hastold it many times, is that in the spring of 1947 he ran away and joined theClyde Beatty Circus. “I got in trouble with the law and had to take off,” hesaid without further explanation. He signed on as a roustabout and cageboy. “After a short time, 17-year-old LaVey was handling eight Nubian lionsand four Bengal tigers in the cage at once,” says Barton’s book. LaVey saidthat he learned some elemental lessons in magic upon being knocked to theground and finding himself on his back with the hot breath of a lion in hisface: “You have just one defense left: willpower. Any good cat trainer has to- 1416 -learn how to use it, how to charge himself full of adrenaline, to send outgamma rays to penetrate the brain of the cat. That’s when you really learnpower and magic, even how to play God.”One day the calliope player, Fred Mullen, got drunk, and LaVey waspressed into service. He played the William Tell Overture - to suchenthusiastic reviews that Mullen spent the rest of the season on thesidelines. “Anton would subsequently perform mood-setting, emotionallycharged music to accompany some of the world’s most famous circus acts:the Harmefords’ riding team, the Concellos, Harold Alzana, the FlyingWallendas, the Cristianis and others,” says the Barton biography.[According to the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wisconsin, which hasthe 1947 route books of the Beatty circus, there was no one named LaVey orLevey listed in either the cages or the band, which does not mean that hemight not have been employed in some other capacity for a brief period oftime. Several of the acts that Barton lists in her book, however, such as theConcellos, Harold Akana, and the Cristianis, were primarily RinglingBrothers performers.]Now the music changed. It was the snaky sound of “The BillboardMarch” - the melody of the midway, the freak shows, the hoochie-coochiegirls. The next stop of the LaVey legend was the carnival, where in the lateForties and early Fifties he said he played the Hammond organ and learnedto tell fortunes: “I got to rub elbows with human oddities - freaks, dancers,showgirls who wanted to be stars - it was a chance to meet people who werereally marginal.”LaVey claimed to have gotten a critical insight into the nature ofreligion during this period because he was often recruited by travelingevangelists to play gospel tunes. “My exposure to grassroots Christianitywas on a real dirt-lot, tent-show level,” LaVey recalled. While he wasplaying “Bringing in the Sheaves”, he would look out at the audienceclamoring to be saved. “I’d see the same goddamned faces that had beenogling the half-naked girls at the carnival the night before.” It was, he hassaid many times before, a revelation: “I knew then that the Christian churchthrives on hypocrisy, and that man’s carnal nature will out no matter howmuch it is purged or scourged by any white-light religion.”When winter came in 1948 and the carnival closed for the season,LaVey started playing burlesque houses in Southern California - inparticular a theater called the Mayan, in Los Angeles. “That’s where I metMarilyn Monroe, at the Mayan,” said LaVey. “The guy who ran it was Paul- 1417 -Valentine.” Monroe was down on her luck and had taken up stripping to getby.LaVey began playing “Slow Boat to China”, which he said was one ofMonroe’s numbers, followed by “Harlem Nocturne”, a classic stripper’stune. He played it in the organ mode, with a bawdy snare drum in thebackground outlining the bumps and grinds and a lonely trumpet cryingout for love and attention. “She was what the girls would call a chaindragger, which meant she was slow to take her clothes off,” LaVeyexplained. He had not been particularly interested in her until he noticedher white, marshmallow thighs, with a trail of bruises, which he thoughtadded an air of vulnerability. His old fetish for pale blondes made a suddenentrance, and within a few days he and Marilyn were lovers. The affairlasted about two weeks.“I think she was attracted to your darker elements,” Barton observed asshe fed a mouse to Boaz.“She did have a strange fascination with the dark side,” LaVey agreed.“I’ve tried to retrace all the places we stayed, like the fleabag motel onWashington Boulevard where we lived together, the whole West Adamssection of L.A., where we drove around in Marilyn’s Pontiac …”As a souvenir of those days, LaVey produced a copy of Monroe’sfamous nude Golden Dreams calendar, which he said she sent him. Thereshe was, lusciously recumbent against a red satin drop, her legs curledunder and her left arm raised invitingly, her body so white but her open lipsso red; even her nipples looked red against that pale, pale skin. “DearTony,” the inscription read in a large and handsome script. “How manytimes have you seen this! Love, Marilyn”. 939“Her big break came right after we broke up,” LaVey recalled. “She dida walk-on in a Groucho Marx movie. Then John Huston gave her a greatpart in Asphalt Jungle.” [As it happens, the romantic lead in the MarxBrothers’ movie, Love Happy, was Paul Valentine, the same man who ranthe Mayan Theater. “I don’t know if Marilyn ever performed at the Mayan,”Valentine says, “but I do know she was never one of my dancers.” In anycase, Valentine says he operated the Mayan as “a legitimate theater - it wasnever a burlesque, never a bump and grind.” He says LaVey never workedfor him, either.]While Monroe moved quickly on to stardom, LaVey drifted to SanFrancisco, and it was here, in 1950, that he met a tiny teenage blonde939 Actually forged by Diane LaVey, as she later acknowledged to their daughterZeena.- 1418 -named Carole Lansing. They married a year later, even though Carole wasonly fifteen. The Korean War was going on at the time, and in order toevade the draft LaVey signed up to study criminology at San Francisco’sCity College. His first daughter, Karla, was born in 1952. To support hisyoung family, LaVey got a job as a police department photographer. He sawchildren splattered by hit-and-run drivers, women cut to pieces by jealoushusbands, the bloated bodies of suicides fished out of San Francisco Bay.He came to the conclusion that if this brutal carnage were God’s will, thenhe wanted nothing more to do with God. “There is no God,” he said hedecided. “There is no supreme, all-powerful deity in the heavens that caresabout the lives of human beings. There is nobody up there who gives a shit.Man must be taught to answer to himself and other men for hisactions.” [According to the San Francisco Police Department, no one namedHoward or Anton LaVey or Levey ever worked for the force, nor does CityCollege have a record of his enrollment. Frank Moser, a retired policeofficer who worked in the photo department during that time, says thatLaVey was never in that department under any name. LaVey himselfsuggested that the records were probably purged by the department toavoid embarrassment. The first time the name LaVey - or actually, La Vey -makes an appearance in the official records is the wedding application filedin Reno on September 4th, 1951, between Carole Lansing and HowardAnton La Vey. They were divorced in 1962. Karla LaVey says that hermother died in 1975.]A switch here, a switch there, and the sound deepened into a throatytheater organ. It was “Deep in the Heart of Texas”, which LaVey slylyplayed in my honor. He said he was the official organist of the city of SanFrancisco until 1966, playing “the largest pipe organ west of Chicago” in theCivic Auditorium, where so many conventions were held. “I played officialbanquets, political functions, basketball games.” [There actually was noposition as city organist in San Francisco, according to Julie Burford at theCivic Auditorium. Carole LaVey’s divorce pleadings state that her husband’ssole income was $29.91 per week, derived from playing the Wurlitzer organat the Lost Weekend nightclub and “various infrequent affairs at the CivicAuditorium”.]Blanche Barton had a cold. She stuck a package of tissues in her purseand glanced outside. “It’s nice out,” she said, looking at the fog and thelight, chilly rain.It was sundown, and LaVey was just rising. He sleeps, he said, in four-hour stretches. While we waited for him to emerge, I roamed around the- 1419 -small parlor, where - with the exception of the kitchen and the bathroom - Ihad been restricted. It was a great frustration for me because I knew fromold newspaper accounts and from speaking to former associates of LaVey’sthat there really were secret passages and amazing artifacts buried in thisthirteen-room house. A trapdoor to the basement, for instance, led to hisfamous Den of Iniquity, with his Hammond organ, a Rock-Ola jukebox, andhis mannequins - Steve the Sailor, Bonita the Whore, Fritz the Cabbie andGwen the Drunk, the last passed out on a bar stool with a puddle of urineon the floor beneath her. It was LaVey’s latest in a series of attempts tocreate a “total environment”, one in which time stands still. Downstairs itwas 1944.“Anton literally has created an underground world in his basement,”says his old friend Kenneth Anger, the filmmaker and author of HollywoodBabylon, one of the bitchiest books ever composed. “We share a fondnessfor mannequins,” Anger says sweetly. When he and LaVey met, “it was justlike a friend I should have known forever - we’ve never had a quarrel.”Anger met LaVey in the early sixties, when Anger was in San Franciscoworking on Invocation of my Demon Brother, a film version of a blackmass. Anger fell in with an informal group of friends who met each Fridayevening in LaVey’s house to discuss the occult. They called themselves theMagic Circle. It was this group that eventually became the nucleus of theChurch of Satan. It included novelist Stephen Schneck; a Danish baronessnamed Carin de Plessen; Donald Werby, who is one of the wealthiestinvestors in the city [he owns interests in the Clift, the Grosvenor and theHoliday Inn hotels in San Francisco]; and Werby’s wife, Willy. Along withthis group was a selection of science-fiction writers, a tattoo artist, a dildomanufacturer, and a handful of San Francisco police officers.These meetings became famous in the city, and eventually LaVeyopened them to the public, charging $2.50 a head to hear his lectures“Fortunetelling and Character Analysis” or “Love Potions and MonkeyGlands”. Vampires, werewolves, freaks, homunculi, bondage and torture,moon madness - it was a survey course of the weird, the forbidden and theoccult. People would spill over to the stairway outside and listen throughthe windows. One memorable evening LaVey spoke on the subject ofcannibalism, and his wife - his second wife, a slender blonde named Diane -served a small portion of a human thigh, which a doctor friend had salvagedfrom an autopsy.By 1964 LaVey was cutting a conspicuous public figure in SanFrancisco as a “psychic investigator” who drove a coroner’s van and could- 1420 -be seen strolling with a black leopard named Zoltan. 940 Zoltan used to sleepin the crib with Karla. When the leopard was run over by a car, he wasquickly replaced by a ten-week-old Nubian lion named Togare. 941Whatever LaVey’s actual connections were to the circus, people whovisited him were impressed with his ability to handle the lion in his ownhouse. Togare could be rambunctious - he left a scar on Karla’s back - butLaVey had him trained so that he would not eat until his master had taken abite of his own dinner. “I used to call him to his meal by playing ‘Onward,Christian Soldiers’,” LaVey said. Unfortunately, Togare had the habit ofroaring at night, which kept the neighbors awake. Eventually a cityordinance was passed forbidding lions in private homes, and Togare wastaken to the zoo. 942His successor was a beaten-down German shepherd named Bathory,who was confined to the pitch-black narrow entranceway between the frontdoor and the door to the parlor. I could hear the poor creature breathing;she had her nose stuck under the door as if she were craving even theminimal light in the parlor. Her odor, and what seemed like generations ofleftover animal smells, suffused the room But the overarching essence inthis clammy parlor was that of snake - although as far as I knew, Boaz wasseldom let out of his box.Beside the couch was an antique examination table with stirrups on theside, which seemed to me the most sinister object in the room. Next to itwas a chair stacked full with LaVey’s various black hats. Above that, in alight so dim I could scarcely make it out, was a framed sign: “My worstenemies are those who presume me to be harmless. They cannot imaginehow much I resent and disdain them, or just how great a threat they wouldface if I could get at them … Some day, with the help of time, space andcircumstance, I will be able to humiliate them properly - not in a mannerthey would enjoy, but in a style calculated to make them wish they hadnever been born.”940 Per Zeena, Zoltan was not a leopard, but a large Burmese housecat.941 According to Anton LaVey, Togare was intermittently “Nubian” or “Ethiopian”.TheNubian Desert is actually located outside of Ethiopia, adjacent to the Red Seainneighboring Sudan. Possibly Togare’s parents commuted.942 According to Edward Webber, Togare was taken away from Anton by court orderbecause of Webber’s complaint that Anton was abusing him with a cattle prod [seeChapter #3]. A San Francisco law against lion pets would not have applied expost factoto a current such pet.- 1421 -Just then LaVey entered and greeted me with his gap-toothed smile.The missing teeth, he had already admitted, he had extracted himself: “Idon’t get them fixed, I just pull them out when it’s time.” I supposed itwould be difficult to get a dental appointment in any case, given hisschedule.LaVey stuck his Smith & Wesson .38 in his holster in the small of hisback and a nifty five-shot derringer in the pocket of his leather jacket. “Inever go out without armaments,” he said He claims to be a championmarksman and trick shot.“Do you have a permit for those?” I asked.He laughed and flipped open his wallet. Inside was a San FranciscoPolice Department badge. “Look at the serial number,” he said. It wasnumber 666.We were going over the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin County for dinnertonight Barton was driving, despite her wretched cold.On the way LaVey talked about androids, his favorite hobbyhorse. Hehas spent years working on his own android prototypes - his mannequins -preparing for the day when the science of robotics will enable industry tobegin the production of artificial human companions. “The forbiddenindustry,” he called it. “Polite, sophisticated, technologically feasibleslavery.” Most of his dolls are store mannequins with their faces sawn off,replaced by latex impressions taken from his friends.“I sculpted one entirely out of polyurethane foam,” LaVey said as weedged across the bridge through the fog. “I inhaled all those fumes trying tocreate a realistic woman with actual sexual parts. I put so much of mypersonal fetishistic desire into it that I became like Pygmalion. I keptexpecting her to show up on my doorstep.”“Do you have sex with your dolls?” I asked.Pause.“I tried to,” he said. “It was going to be my great test run. Just as I wasentering her, the damn room started shaking. An earthquake hit. I figured itwas God’s way of trying to tell me something. So I ceased” - he laughed -“my activities of the moment.”LaVey turned suddenly solemn. ‘When I say ‘God’, you know, it’s just afigure of speech.”His theology is a puzzle. He has often tried to break off Satanism fromany belief system. “Satanism is not just an occultnik-type thing,” he toldme. “It is a way of life, an æsthetic ideal, a code of behavior.” Perhaps whathe stands for is best understood this way: More than anything else, LaVey’s- 1422 -life is spent evoking a mood, an era, and a way of looking at the worldthrough his art. He sees it as a Satanic exercise, a way of replacing God withhis own vision of creation. He is still in mourning for the lost moment of theForties.“I like dark, wet environments with street lights reflecting in the wetpavement, little towns with farmhouses in the distance, all-night gasstations in the middle of nowhere, bars with glass-brick fronts that are darkinside even at two in the afternoon, back alleys in the lost parts of town,streets that wander off into the fields, general stores that double asGreyhound depots, the sound of a siren in the night, automobiles with longhoods and short rear ends, women with moll-like qualities who are realsidekicks, the clicking of high heels on the pavement …”In LaVey’s world, women still wear bright red lipstick, and the musicswings softly, and sex is there but not there, in the teasing, exaggeratedfashion of the DC Comic books that he used to read and save and still hasinside plastic envelopes, and men have undreamed-of powers just like thefilm noir anti-heroes he grew up on - the Green Hornet, the Shadow, theWhistler. “Batman,” he told me, “is the perfect manifestation of the Satanicethic. These are the heroes who work in the shadows, doing what officialscannot do or will not do.”His music, his mannequins, his writings, the “total environments” heattempts to create, his taste in just about everything, are reflections of thisSatanic pursuit of making his own world. Later, as I began to take apart theliterary creation he had made of his life, I would realize that “Anton LaVey”was itself his supreme creation, his ultimate Satanic object, a sort ofandroid composed of all the elements his mysterious creator had chosenfrom the universe of dark possibilities.And yet there was still a question in my mind about what he actuallybelieved. He had told me that he believed in a “balance of nature, a naturalorder”.“That’s God,” he said. “And that’s Satan. Satan is God. He is therepresentation of the state of flux; he is the action/reaction; he is the causeand the effect; he is all the elements interwoven in what we call evolution.”That statement seemed to me little more than an elaboration of his parents’single religious dictum: Another word for God is nature. Another word forGod is Satan. Another word for nature is evolution.I recalled a queer passage in a book by Susan Atkins, who was a toplessdancer in LaVey’s short-lived North Beach nightclub act, the Witches’- 1423 -Workshop943 , before she became a killer in Charles Manson’s family. Atthat time, Atkins was dancing under the name Sharon King. While LaVeywas trying to recruit her for the vampire role, he invited her to attend one ofhis Satanic services. She told him she preferred not to, since she didn’tbelieve in the Devil. “But, Sharon,” he said, “we don’t believe in God either,but that doesn’t mean he isn’t real.”“I am a skeptic,” he admitted when I pressed him on the subject,“although I want to believe in something. And whenever we want to believein something so strongly, we do speculate on its existence. But I needsomething more than pap or clichés, something more personalized. MaybeI’m practicing solipsism.”That wasn’t always so, according to Michael Aquino, LaVey’s formeracolyte and now his chief rival. Aquino claims that when they first met in1969, LaVey believed in a literal Devil. “I think Anton’s loss of faith camelater,” says Aquino. “It was a side effect of his insecurity at being the headof an institution that had grown beyond him.” In order to deal with thespreading popularity of the Church of Satan, LaVey had set up a formalexamination process in order to ordain new members of the priesthood.Some of LaVey’s Hollywood friends, such as Jayne Mansfield and SammyDavis, Jr., were awarded priesthood status without having to pass any tests,which rankled some of the membership. 944 Then, in 1975, LaVey made thecontroversial decision to sell degrees in the priesthood. Aquino says hebegged him to reconsider.“In my letter of resignation, I said essentially that the Church of Satanis not the same thing as the Church of Anton LaVey,” says Aquino. “Thosepriesthoods are not yours to sell.” In Aquino’s opinion, LaVey was turninghis back on Satan. The church split over the issue. “Virtually the entirenationwide priesthood resigned en masse,” says Aquino. Some of LaVey’sformer priests joined Aquino’s competing organization, the Temple of Set.943 Actually the “Topless Witches Revue”. The “Witches Workshop” was a series ofclasses conducted at 6114 California Street at about that same time.944 Completely untrue. Although Jayne Mansfield had been called a Priestess byAnton,that was in the earliest days of the Church, long before it had grown beyond asmall SanFrancisco institution. She was dead long before the formal degree-system,including thePriesthood III°, was instituted. As of 1969 there was still no degree system:simplyoffices of “Priest” and “Minister” [see Appendix #8]. In the March 1970 issue oftheCloven Hoof Anton announced the 5-level degree system, including the PriesthoodofMendes as the III°. Sammy Davis, Jr. never held the Priesthood, but rather anhonorarydegree of Warlock II° [see Chapter #24].- 1424 -LaVey himself lapsed into the bitter retreat from which he has neveremerged. “That’s when he said, ‘I don’t believe in the Devil,’” saysAquino. 945“It was not a schism,” says LaVey of Aquino’s departure. “It was a dropin the bucket. Aquino took twenty-eight people with him and startedspreading the rumor that the Church of Satan was defunct and that he hadgotten the divine word from the man downstairs to take over.” 946“Yeah, I knew LaVey back in the late Forties or early Fifties,” says aretired San Francisco police inspector with the improbable name of JackWebb. “He was an outstanding pianist locally.” Webb used to hear LaVeyplay at the Lost Weekend, and during breaks the two would chat aboutmagic and the occult. Webb was impressed: “One night I said off the cuff,‘Tony, with all your ideas you ought to start your own church.’” 947“The seed of that idea fruited in 1966 when LaVey ceremonially shavedhis head and ordained the beginning of the Age of Satan. It was April 30th -Walpurgisnacht, the highest holiday of the Satanic calendar. Now it wasWalpurgisnacht more than two decades later, and LaVey was in a reflectivemood. “I try to minimize it, but deep down inside I can’t - it’s still ameaningful anniversary,” he said as we sat in his favorite neighborhoodFrench restaurant. The chef noticed LaVey as he entered and sent out a traywith a glass of Dubonnet on the rocks for each of us - LaVey’s only alcoholicindulgence. “Life everlasting, world without end,” LaVey said in a sardonictoast.945 Appendix #142.946 The Temple of Set had a founding membership of approximately 100 individualswhoresigned from the Church of Satan during the June-August 1975 period. Thisnucleusincluded virtually every functioning member of the Priesthood, every grottoleader, andevery regional agent active at the time. See Appendix #143.947 Also contradicted by Webber [in Chapter #3], who was a professionalpublicist forLaVey and the Church at the time.- 1425 -He had thought, he said, that his little church would be a covertactivity: “I had no idea it would snowball in a year’s time. I was stunnedwhen everything happened so fast.” 948The publicity explosion began with a Satanic wedding that LaVeyperformed for John Raymond, a former writer for the Christian ScienceMonitor, and Judith Case, the daughter of a Republican stalwart in NewYork. A photograph of the couple, with LaVey standing beside them in hisblack cape and homed cowl and a naked redhead, who’d served as the altar,behind them, was carried in newspapers and magazines all across theworld.Barbara McNair, the black actress and singer, attended the ceremony.That began a correspondence between LaVey and Hollywood that wouldadd luster and credibility to LaVey’s organization. Among the stars LaVeyhas claimed as friends over the years are Kim Novak, Christopher Lee,Laurence Harvey and Keenan Wynn. 949LaVey has served as a consultant on many different films - notably, thestylishly kitsch950 Abominable Dr. Phibes, in which Vincent Price played acharacter based on LaVey,951 and Rosemary’s Baby, in which LaVey himself948 There was neither record nor mention of Kim Novak or Laurence Harvey during1969-1975. Christopher Lee was neither a member of the Church nor a friend ofAnton’s;the story of their disastrous meeting at Sammy Davis’ house is recounted inChapter#24. Anton met Keenan Wynn during the filming of The Devil’s Rain in 1974; Wynnaccepted neither membership nor Priesthood in the Church of Satan, however, asof1975. The LaVey claim of his support began after the actor’s death some yearslater.949 Actually Art Nouveau and Art Deco.950 In fact Anton LaVey’s “association” with Dr. Phibes began as a consequenceof hisreceipt of the first edition of this Church of Satan history, in which wereincluded theparallels I drew at the beginnings of Chapters #2 and #34! He was not aconsultant foreither of the Phibes films, either according to their credits or according tohis ownstatements at the time ( The Abominable Dr. Phibes 1971, Dr. Phibes Rises Again1972).The Phibes character was not modeled on Anton LaVey, but was the creation ofJamesWhiton and William Goldstein. Cf. James Robert Parish and Steven Whitney,VincentPrice Unmasked (New York: Drake Publishers, 1974).951 As since revealed, the actor playing the “human” Devil was John Cassavetes,while aperson much smaller than LaVey wore the “inhuman” Devil-suit. The “Devil eyes”appearing in the film were artificial, vertical-slitted “cat’s eyes”. SeeChapter #3.- 1426 -played the serpentine devil who impregnates Mia Farrow. 952 LaVey calledthat movie “the best paid commercial for Satanism since the Inquisition.”LaVey’s most notable conquest in Hollywood, however, was JayneMansfield. “I remember Jayne, all right,” says Jack Webb. In the early daysof the church, Webb used to drop by for some of the rituals, along withseveral other San Francisco cops. “One night she was lying naked on Tony’sgrand piano. I’ll never forget that sight.” 953Mansfield had already made a reputation in Hollywood for hervigorous sexual appetites. “She liked to be humiliated,” LaVey said. “Shelonged for a stern master.” He claimed Mansfield sought him out afterreading a newspaper article about him. She wanted LaVey to put a curse onher Italian husband, with whom she was involved in a custody dispute.Soon after that, she became a priestess in the Church of Satan. She evenposed for publicity photographs with LaVey, showing herself kneeling at hisfeet as he administered a chalice of some magical liquid. Satanism seemedto strike some deep chord inside her. She called it “Khalil Gibran withballs.” 954For his part, LaVey responded to what he saw as a kindred spirit. “Shenever let the image down, not even in private - I could see a lot of myself inthat,” he once admitted. “Perhaps she feared people wouldn’t love herwithout the image.”Her death would become a major element in the LaVey legend. SamBrody, Mansfield’s lawyer, agent and frustrated suitor, was jealous ofLaVey’s relationship with his client. LaVey despised Brody from the firstmoment he saw him. “I don’t know why attorneys have that effect on me -to the point that I have no choice but to say, ‘Look, you don’t know whoyou’re dealing with....’“ One night Brody mischievously lit a pair of black candles on LaVey’saltar. “Mr. LaVey was furious with Sam,” Mansfield told her biographer.“He proclaimed, ‘You are cursed by the Devil. You will be killed within ayear!’”A few months later, on June 29th, 1967, Mansfield and Brody wereriding on U.S. 90 near New Orleans when their driver rear-ended a tank952 Probably not true, as indicated by Edward Webber’s discussion of Mansfield’sbehavior [see Chapter #3].953 I have never seen this quote verified to Mansfield.954 I do not consider myself Anton LaVey’s “archenemy” nor an “enemy” of his atall.- 1427 -truck that was spraying for mosquitoes. Brody and Mansfield were bothkilled instantly - the actress was actually decapitated in the accident.LaVey claims he had been looking through his scrapbook when henoticed that in clipping an article about his placing flowers on MarilynMonroe’s grave, he inadvertently had cut into a picture of Mansfield on thenext page. He had lopped off her head Then the phone rang. It was an APreporter with the news.He puts a lot of weight on such coincidences. Walpurgisnacht, forinstance, is the birth date of television at the New York World’s Fair in1939. [“What a Satanic bomb that proved to be!”] It is the day Hitlercommitted suicide in 1945. The day LaVey’s lion, Togare, died in 1981. Justthis very afternoon, Barton was reading through a Mansfield biography andobserved the date of Mansfield’s first studio tryout: April 30th, 1954.“Things are always turning up like that,” LaVey said, unsurprised. “It’sthe little things that are the big things.”He was beginning to turn melancholy. “Deep down, I still have an urgeto put on the paraphernalia and go through a ritual,” he admitted. But thatis all behind him. He hasn’t performed a Black Mass in twenty years.He was talking now with his eyes closed. It was a peculiar affectation,one that hinted of his great need to live in his own world, to shut out theintrusions of reality and stay locked inside his head with his darkimagination. He said he expected society to stratify itself naturally, withSatanists rising to the top to inherit the Earth - a process he said washappening faster than he could have predicted. But until that day comes, hehas chosen the strategy of abdication. “I have decided to withdraw, to giveup my citizenship in the human race.”Later I learned that, earlier in the evening, LaVey’s younger daughterhad chosen this special day to renounce her father. “I officially and rituallyended my positions as Church of Satan representative - defender anddaughter of Anton LaVey,” Zeena declared in a letter to LaVey’s archenemy,Michael Aquino. 955 She complained that her father “was filled, and still is,with petty jealous criticism of my efforts - this was easy for him to do fromthe safe vantage point of the comfortable and risk-free easy chair we knowhe has lived in for decades.”LaVey’s duck arrived, baked in a currant sauce. This seemed to revivehim. He started railing against the predominant notion that Satanists arechild murderers or that they sacrifice animals. He himself has always955 Parfrey, Adam, Introduction in LaVey, Anton Szandor, The Devil’s Notebook.Portland: Feral House #ISBN-0-922915-11-3, 1992.- 1428 -preached against such practices, he said. He despised the assault on publicorder: The police force has to take care of people without conscience; in factthere’s very little conscience left. “I’m not advocating a benign police stateexactly, but there’s a need for certain elements of control. There has to betyranny. If you don’t want to call it tyranny, call it rational stratification.The alternative is chaos and anarchy, savage and bestial. If this soundsfascistic, so be it.”“He loves Disneyland,” Barton added. “That’s been a real trial balloonfor a lot of this - the incorporation of androids, a private enclave with aself-contained justice system, its own private police force. It’s a good example ofcapitalism at its peak.”Something had been bugging me, and this mention of Disneylandbrought it to life. It was the sense that under all this savage philosophythere was a man who was fundamentally harmless. It was of course thething he feared the most.Where was all the sin? Where was the ribaldry? Where was thedangerous action? From my two weeks of observation, Anton LaVey lived alife more circumscribed and reclusive than a Benedictine monk’s.This observation put him on the defensive. “I’m just as ribald as I usedto be,” he said, “but I have to be more careful now. Security isn’t what itused to be.”But what were his indulgences? So far all I had noticed were his singleglass of Dubonnet in the evening and an occasional Excedrin, which he tookinstead of coffee for “a little lift”.“I would like to indulge more,” he admitted. “If I were unencumbered, Iwould. My vice now is to wake up in the morning feeling halfway decent.”“What about sex?”“I’ve been around women all my life. It takes more than a lot of nudefemale bodies to move me now. I’d rather be reading an old book.“I don’t want to say I’m too old to cut the mustard,” he continuedelliptically. “But if the battle’s raging and shells are coming through thewindow, the stress level rises, and it does tend to dampen one’s ardor.These guys that go around saying their pilot light’s out - maybe they’reconcerned about their health - they’re going to get pretty limp. Thedemoralization factor has to be considered rather …” He groped in the airfor a word.“Inhibiting?” Barton suggested.“Inhibiting,” LaVey agreed.- 1429 -No liquor, no tobacco, no drugs, no sex, no Black Masses, no babysacrifices - what vice or indulgence was left for a Satanist to set himselfapart from the common herd?“What if they kill people?” LaVey said.“Do you kill people?”He looked up and smiled. The waiter had just arrived with a healthyslice of mud pie.“I don’t want the legend to disappear,” LaVey told me anxiously in ourlast conversation, after I confronted him with some of the inconsistencies inhis story. “There is a danger you will disenchant a lot of young people whouse me as a role model.” He was especially offended that I had trackeddown his eighty-seven-year-old father in an effort to verify some of thedetails of LaVey’s early life. “I’d rather have my background shrouded inmystery. Eventually you want to be recognized for what you are now.”It was a theme he had sounded many times before. “I don’t want to giveanyone the satisfaction that they have me all figured out,” he says inBarton’s biography. “If people only knew. I’ve always loved that ubiquitousJohnson-Smith Company ad copy, ‘Imagine the expression on their faces…!’ That’s a kind of leitmotif that has tempted me into most of the heinous,evil or disreputable things I’ve ever done. Just imagine people’s reaction ifthey ever found out. But they won’t. It began in mystery. I want it to endthat way.”No doubt it will. But the mystery will not be the life of Anton LaVey.His story is like so many other self-created American legends; the wholepoint of his existence is to be understood immediately. The details of hislife, both real and fabricated, are craftily fitted to the iconography of popculture. Anton LaVey is an imaginary creation, as real, and as false, as asoap-opera character or a comic-book anti-hero. The mystery is theimagination that created Anton LaVey: That is to say, it is the story ofHoward Stanton Levey, the bookish musician who took us all on a journeyinto the dark side of himself.- 1430 -- 1431 -Appendix 152: Hegarty/LaVey Property Agreement- by Diane Hegarty and Anton LaVeyApril 25/26, 1985This agreement entered into between Diane Hegarty (hereafter Diane)and Anton S.

Video camera.- 1442 -- 1443 -Appendix 153: First Amended Complaint- by Diane HegartyDecember 7, 1988Superior Court of the State of CaliforniaCity and County of San FranciscoNumber 891863Diane Hegarty, Plaintiffvs.Anton LaVey and Does I-X inclusive, DefendantsFirst Amended ComplaintComes now plaintiff, Diane Hegarty, formerly known as Diane LaVey,hereinafter referred to as plaintiff, who alleges as follows:1. Plaintiff is co-owner of real and personal property located in the Cityand County of San Francisco, State of California.2. Defendant Anton LaVey, hereinafter referred to as defendant LaVey,is co-owner with plaintiff of real and personal property located in the Cityand County of San Francisco, State of California. At all times hereinrelevant and to the present, defendant LaVey was and is a resident of theCity and County of San Francisco.3. The Does named herein are sued pursuant to the provisions of §474of the California Code of Civil Procedure. When their true names andcapacities are ascertained, plaintiff will ask leave of court to amend thiscomplaint to so state.4. On or about April 15, 1962 plaintiff and defendant LaVey enteredinto an oral agreement to live together for the purpose of combining theirskills, efforts, labor, and earnings to raise Mr. LaVey’s daughter and tomaintain property then occupied by defendant LaVey, which was owned bydefendant LaVey’s father.5. After entering into the above-referenced oral agreement, plaintiffand defendant began to live together and thenceforward held themselvesout publicly as husband and wife, including filing joint federal and stateincome tax returns. On November 19, 1963 plaintiff gave birth to adaughter, fathered by defendant LaVey and surnamed LaVey according todefendant LaVey’s express wishes.- 1444 -6. On or about April 30, 1966 plaintiff and defendant formed apartnership and took steps to create a not-for-profit corporation under thelaws of the State of California, using the fictitious business name “Church ofSatan”. Plaintiff and defendant participated equally in promoting andoperating said business. Plaintiff arranged publicity and handled allbusiness aspects including membership, correspondence, invoicing,payment of bills, and typing and editing of manuscripts written bydefendant LaVey, namely the Satanic Bible, Satanic Rituals, CompleatWitch, and as-yet-unpublished Devil’s Notebook. Plaintiff also negotiatedfor publication of foreign language editions of the books written bydefendant. Plaintiff and defendant continued the daily operation of saidbusiness on an equal basis until April 1984. Subsequent to April 1984plaintiff continued to participate in said business by managing thecorrespondence and bookkeeping aspects of said business until on or aboutAugust 1, 1986.7. On or about July 9, 1971 Michael Levey, father of defendant LaVey,gave the property known as 6114 California Street, San Francisco,California to Anton and Diane LaVey, his wife, by grant deed. Theconsideration for this gift by Michael Levey was that plaintiff and defendantwould pay any indebtedness previously incurred against the property byMichael Levey. A true copy of said deed is attached as Exhibit #A andincorporated herein by this reference. Simultaneously plaintiff anddefendant LaVey sought and obtained refinancing upon said property,obtaining the loan as husband and wife. Plaintiff and defendant LaVey, whohad continuously resided at said property since April 1962, continued toreside together at said property until April 30, 1984, when plaintiff left thepremises. Defendant LaVey continues to live at said property.8. Between the dates of April 1962 and April 1984, while plaintiff anddefendant continued to live together, plaintiff was periodically subjected tophysical and verbal abuse by defendant LaVey.9. Because of defendant’s violent and abusive behavior, plaintiff left thefamily residence in fear for her life on or about April 30, 1984. Plaintiffsought and obtained restraining orders against defendant LaVey in SanFrancisco Superior Court Case #825962. Said orders, which are effectivefor one year from date of issuance, were renewed on October 21, 1985 andOctober 29, 1986. Defendant has not stopped harassing and threateningplaintiff despite the existence of said orders. Defendant has made both oraland written threats against plaintiff between the dates of April 30, 1984 andpresent.- 1445 -10. On or about April 26, 1985 plaintiff and defendant LaVey enteredinto a written agreement regarding the characterization of real andpersonal property which they had accumulated during the 22 years whileliving and working together, and regarding their intentions as to such realand personal property. A true copy of said agreement, signed by the partiesthereto, is attached to this complaint as Exhibit #B and incorporated hereinby this reference.11. Pursuant to the terms of the written agreement as heretoforealleged, at Paragraph #9 of said agreement, plaintiff and defendant LaVeywere to share occupancy of the jointly-owned real property. Plaintiff anddefendant LaVey agreed that said real property would be remodeled toprovide separate access to the floors to be occupied by each party.Defendant LaVey failed and refused to cooperate with the terms of theagreement with respect to the remodeling, and dishonored all provisionsmade in said agreement to ensure plaintiff’s privacy.12. As a result of defendant LaVey’s refusal to permit construction of aseparate entrance to plaintiff’s private quarters, and as a result of defendantLaVey’s constant intrusions upon plaintiff’s agreed-upon portion of saidproperty without the permission or consent of plaintiff, plaintiff feared forher personal safety and was thus rendered unable to reside at the premises.13. Since the date upon which plaintiff realized she would be unable tooccupy that portion of the property designated as her private quarters, shehas attempted to arrive at an equitable division of the propertycharacterized as jointly-owned. She has made repeated telephonic andwritten requests of defendant LaVey to participate in a plan for dividingsaid property. Plaintiff and defendant LaVey met together, with counsel, inNovember 1987 for the stated purpose of effecting such division, butdefendant LaVey refused to consider all proposals made at that time. On orabout March 20, 1988 plaintiff wrote to defendant LaVey stating her desireto divide the jointly-owned real and personal property by sale and givinggiving defendant LaVey 30 days within which to respond. Defendant LaVeymade no response to plaintiff’s demand.First Cause of Action(for specific performance or damages based upon breach of expresscontract)14. Plaintiff realleges and hereby incorporates the allegations containedin paragraphs #1-3 and #10-13 as though fully set forth.- 1446 -15. On or about April 26, 1985 plaintiff and defendant LaVey enteredinto a written agreement, hereinafter referred to as “agreement”, a copy ofwhich is attached hereto as Exhibit #B and incorporated herein by thisreference. The purpose of said agreement was to “memorialize” their 23-year relationship and to “memorialize” the nature of the real and personalproperty acquired by the parties during the 23 years of their relationshipand partnership. The agreement did not purport to effect an actual divisionof said property, with the exception that the agreement contemplated anequitable partition of the jointly-owned real property, to enable bothparties to continue to occupy said real property while continuing to operatethe family business, and to maintain joint possession and control of thejointly-owned personal property.16. Paragraph #4 of said agreement states that the property listed asAttachment #C of the agreement, which attachment includes the CaliforniaStreet property and residence, is property jointly owned and acquired bythe parties during their relationship and partnership. Said property ishereafter referred to as “equitable property”.17. As heretofore alleged, on or about August 1, 1986 defendant LaVeybreached the agreement to divide the real property by his refusal toremodel the real property to create private quarters for plaintiff to occupy.Such refusal by defendant LaVey rendered the written agreement worthlessto plaintiff.18. Because of defendant LaVey’s failure and refusal to act inaccordance with the terms of the agreement, defendant LaVey has breachedsaid agreement. Plaintiff has lost the use of her residence and has lostpossession and control of the jointly-owned personal property, all to heractual damage in an amount to be determined.19. Because of defendant LaVey’s breach of the agreement to hold andutilize property jointly with plaintiff, plaintiff has been rendered unable toreside at the jointly-owned real property and has lost possession andcontrol of the jointly-owned personal property, all to her actual damage inan amount to be determined.20. Plaintiff has been forced to secure replacement housing atsubstantial rent and to purchase household furniture and furnishings.Having devoted herself to the development of the family business, plaintiffwas forced to enter the job market without references or resume in order tosupport herself, all to her damage in an amount to be determined.- 1447 -Second Cause of Action(for specific performance or damages based upon breach of expressagreement)21. Plaintiff realleges and thereby incorporates herein the allegationscontained in paragraphs #1-7 and paragraphs #10-13 of the withincomplaint.22. In furtherance of the oral agreement, as alleged in paragraph #4,plaintiff and defendant LaVey lived together, raised children together, andfounded and conducted all of the business endeavors of the Church of Satantogether until April 1984.23. In April 1984 defendant LaVey drove plaintiff from the familyresidence by force and threats of violence. Plaintiff continued to render herservices and contribute her skills, efforts, and labor to the Church of Satanuntil August 1986.24. During the 22 years that plaintiff and defendant LaVey livedtogether, they acquired as a result of their skills, efforts, labor, andearningscertain real and personal property, hereinafter referred to as “equitableproperty”, consisting of the following:(a) Real property and residence located at 6114 California Street, SanFrancisco, California, such real property being conveyed to them ashusband and wife by grant deed on July 9, 1971.(b) Furniture, furnishings, art objects, antiques, and personal effectscurrently located at the above residence, such items listed specifically in thewritten agreement executed between the parties attached to this complaintas Exhibit #B and incorporated herein by this reference.(c) Such other and further equitable property as may have beenaccumulated between the parties through their efforts while living togetherwhich is not now listed on any agreement between the parties but may bediscovered subsequently. Plaintiff will ask leave of the court to amend thiscomplaint to set forth the exact description and value of any such after-discovered equitable property when such information has been discovered.25. In April 1985 plaintiff and defendant LaVey entered into a writtenagreement which memorializes the oral agreement under which they hadobtained property during cohabitation. This writing, the Hegarty-LaVeyagreement, is attached as Exhibit #B.26. By terms of the agreement plaintiff and defendant LaVey were toequally share access to the jointly-owned real property and to the jointly-owned personal property.- 1448 -27. Plaintiff has at all times performed each and every covenant andcondition by her to be performed as contemplated by the terms of the oralagreement, subsequently memorialized in the written agreement.28. Defendant LaVey has breached the oral agreement, asmemorialized in the written agreement, by failing and refusing to equitablypartition the family residence, thereby enabling plaintiff to reside thereinand to maintain her access to the jointly-owned personal property, all toplaintiff’s general damage in an amount to be determined.29. Defendant LaVey has further breached the oral agreement, asmemorialized in the written agreement, by failing and refusing to respondto plaintiff’s written request that the real and personal property be dividedby sale and division of the proceeds, all to plaintiff’s general damage in anamount to be determined.Third Cause of Action(for damages for fraud and deceit)30. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein the allegations containedin paragraphs #1-3 and #10-13 as though fully set forth.31. On or about April 26, 1985 defendant LaVey falsely andfraudulently and with intent to deceive and defraud plaintiff, represented toplaintiff by means of the written agreement attached hereto as Exhibit #Bthat he would participate in remodeling the real property jointly owned bythe parties in order to provide plaintiff with exclusive access to and use ofthe top floor of said property.32. Said representations were false, and defendant knew them to befalse. In truth and in fact defendant LaVey never intended to relinquish anyportion of the real property to plaintiff for her exclusive use and access, nordid defendant LaVey ever intend to refrain from intruding upon plaintiff inher quiet enjoyment of her portion of the property.33. Plaintiff believed and relied upon the said representations made bydefendant LaVey, and was thereby induced to refrain from requesting animmediate division or sale of the property and to continue to make herservices available to defendant LaVey in the jointly-owned business.34. Plaintiff did not discover the fraud and deceit practiced upon heruntil the summer of 1986, when defendant LaVey specifically disavowedany intention ever to divide the property as contemplated by the agreementor to allow plaintiff to lease her portion of the premises to a third party.Plaintiff could not with reasonable diligence have discovered said fraud and- 1449 -deceit prior to the summer of 1986 because defendant LaVey continued toassure plaintiff that the contemplated remodeling would be performed assoon as a plan could be agreed upon and material and workers secured.35. As a direct and proximate result of the fraudulent representationsof defendant LaVey to plaintiff, plaintiff has been damaged by having toabandon the jointly-owned premises and to abandon, in addition, heraccess to and enjoyment of the jointly-owned personal property, whichpersonal property remains situated in the jointly-owned premises. Plaintiffhas been forced to secure substitute lodging at substantially higher cost andto obtain all furniture and furnishings for such lodging, all to her generaldamage in an amount to be determined.Fourth Cause of Action(for rescission of agreement based on fraudulent misrepresentation)36. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein the allegations containedin paragraphs #30-35.37. In truth and in fact the agreement entered into between plaintiffand defendant LaVey is voidable as to plaintiff because of the material falseand fraudulent representations by defendant LaVey, as heretofore alleged.38. Pursuant to the instrument and in reliance on defendant LaVey’srepresentations, plaintiff continued to make her services available to theChurch of Satan while remaining out of possession and control of thejointly-owned real and personal property. Defendant LaVey has hadexclusive use, enjoyment, possession, and control of the jointly-owned realand personal property, all to plaintiff’s general damage, in an amount to bedetermined.39. Defendant LaVey made the representations for the purpose ofinducing plaintiff to sign the agreement, and plaintiff would not havesigned the agreement if defendant LaVey had not made the representationsand if plaintiff had not believed the representations to be true.40. Plaintiff has suffered injury as a result of the fraud by defendantLaVey and as a result of her signing the agreement as a result of that fraud.41. Plaintiff has reasonable grounds to believe that, if left outstanding,the instrument may cause serious injury to her in that defendant will relyupon certain portions of the agreement to prevent an equitable division bysale of the jointly-owned real and personal property and division of the netproceeds of sale. The amount of damage that the instrument, if left- 1450 -outstanding, may cause to plaintiff is as yet undetermined but is estimatedat more than $300,000.42. Plaintiff discovered that the representations were false on or aboutAugust 1, 1986. Subsequent to that date plaintiff has proposedmodifications to the agreement which defendant LaVey has refused toconsider. On or about March 20, 1988 plaintiff notified defendant LaVey ina letter, attached hereto as Exhibit #C and incorporated herein by thisreference, that she elected to cancel the agreement and divide the jointly-owned real and personal property by sale.43. Defendant LaVey failed and refused to respond to this letter withinthe time specified, and wholly refuses to restore plaintiff to joint possessionand control of the jointly-owned real and personal property.Fifth Cause of Action(damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress - Civil Code §3294,3333)44. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein the allegations containedin paragraphs #1-3, #9, and #30-33.45. On or about February 21, 1984 plaintiff sought and obtainedpsychiatric counseling for a mental impairment resulting from years ofphysical and emotional abuse at the hands of defendant LaVey. Suchcounseling continues at present.46. On or about April 30, 1984 plaintiff was forced by defendant’sthreats and violence to leave the family residence. Plaintiff sought andobtained, in 1984, 1985, and 1986, restraining orders prohibiting defendantLaVey from harassing or molesting her. Despite the existence of saidrestraining orders, defendant LaVey continued to contact plaintiff withthreats of violence, both written and telephonic, until January 1988.47. Defendant LaVey never intended to relinquish any portion of thereal property, as contemplated by the written agreement of April 1985, toplaintiff for her exclusive use, access, and quiet enjoyment.48. Defendant LaVey always intended to prevent plaintiff fromexercising her rights to possession and control of the jointly-owned real andpersonal property.49. Defendant LaVey never intended to permit plaintiff to exercise herright to liquidate her share of the jointly-owned real and personal property.50. Defendant LaVey’s conduct was intentional, malicious, and donefor the purpose of causing plaintiff to suffer humiliation, mental anguish,- 1451 -and emotional, physical, and economic distress. Defendant’s conduct inperforming the acts heretofore alleged was done with knowledge thatplaintiff’s emotional and physical distress would thereby increase, and wasdone with a wanton and reckless disregard of the foreseeable consequencesto plaintiff.51. As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts,plaintiff did suffer and continues to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, andemotional, physical, and economic distress, and has been injured in mindas follows: Plaintiff’s anxiety and terror of defendant have forced her toobtain ongoing psychiatric counseling, the cost of which is as yetundetermined. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges thatsuch counseling will be needed over a long term.52. The aforementioned acts by defendant LaVey left plaintiff withoutemployment and ill-prepared to enter the marketplace. Although plaintiffhas obtained employment, her mental and emotional condition precludesher from pursuing a career or from working full-time.Sixth Cause of Action(dissolution of partnership, an accounting, and a receivership)53. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein the allegations containedin paragraphs #1-3 and 6 as though set forth in full.54. On or about April 1965 at San Francisco, California plaintiff anddefendant entered into an oral agreement of partnership, to wit: that inexchange for plaintiff’s participation with defendant in the founding of theChurch of Satan, as well as her subsequent assumption of front-officeresponsibilities (including record-keeping, correspondence, and publicrelations), plaintiff would receive fair monetary remuneration for her labor.55. Said Church was indeed founded by defendant and plaintiff on orabout April 1965 at San Francisco, California.56. On or about April 1965 plaintiff began performing her duties,described above, as office manager of the Church. Plaintiff faithfullyexecuted these responsibilities from the Church’s inception in 1965 untilFebruary 1984, when threats and violence directed towards her bydefendant LaVey made it impossible for them to work together and plaintiffwas forced to abandon her control of the enterprise to defendant LaVey,who currently retains sole control of the business, including exclusivecontrol over access to financial records and assets. Plaintiff continued tomake her services as bookkeeper and correspondent available to defendant- 1452 -LaVey and the business until April 1986, at which time, upon request ofdefendant LaVey, plaintiff trained a person of defendant LaVey’s choosingto perform the above-described tasks.57. On or about April 16, 1986 defendant took exclusive possession andcontrol of the business and has since had for his individual use and benefitlarge sums of money from the receipts of the partnership business(including royalties), exceeding his rightful share, and has refused toaccount to plaintiff for the same. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and onsuch information and belief alleges, that the sum wrongfully taken bydefendant, and the amount due the partnership, is at least $300,000.58. The property and accounts of the partnership are in danger of beinglost, removed, or materially injured in that plaintiff has been excluded frompartnership business and partnership funds have been misappropriated,and it is necessary that a receiver be appointed to take possession of allproperty and accounts of the partnership to receive accounts payable, paycurrent debts, and wind up the business of the partnership.Seventh Cause of Action(partition of real property)59. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein the allegations containedin paragraphs #1-3 and 7 as though fully set forth.60. The real property which is the subject of this action is located in theCity and County of San Francisco, at 6114 California Street, and is legallydescribed in the deed attached hereto as Exhibit A.61. Plaintiff is the owner of a full interest in joint tenancy of said realproperty.62. Defendant LaVey owns an interest identical to that of plaintiff,which interest plaintiff reasonably believes will be materially affected bythis action.63. Partition is hereby sought of the interests in the real property ofplaintiff and of defendant LaVey.64. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that apartition by sale of the real property, rather than physical division thereof,would be more equitable to the parties.65. Partition of the real property and interests therein is in the bestinterests of both parties hereto in that, as heretofore alleged, they areunable to share equally in the benefits of ownership and plaintiff’s interestin the real property has therefore been impaired.- 1453 -66. The prosecution by plaintiff of this participation action is for thecommon benefit of plaintiff and defendant LaVey. Plaintiff has incurredand is continuing to incur reasonable attorney’s fees in the prosecution ofthis action.Eighth Cause of Action(declaratory relief)67. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein the allegations containedin paragraphs #1-66 as though set forth in full.68. An actual controversy has arisen between plaintiff and defendants,and each of them, relating to the legal rights, duties, and obligations of saidparties, to wit:A. Plaintiff contends:(1) As a result of the oral and written agreements betweenplaintiff and defendant LaVey, plaintiff is the owner of one-half of all theaforementioned property as joint tenant with defendant LaVey.(2) All of said equitable property was acquired while theparties were living in the State of California, and is located in this state,andshould be treated as would community property if there were a validmarriage entered into between plaintiff and defendant LaVey. Not toenforce plaintiff’s rights in this regard would constitute a denial of dueprocess and equal protection of the law under the United States andCalifornia Constitutions.(3) Defendant LaVey is estopped from denying the validity oreffectiveness of said agreements by reason of:(a) Defendant had the benefit of plaintiff’s services ascaretaker and parent to his children for 23 years.(b) Defendant had the benefit of plaintiff’s equalparticipation with the business known as the Church of Satan, including herservices as writer, editor, public relations person, correspondent,membership tabulator, bookkeeper, secretary, treasurer, and receptionist,which promoted the goodwill and success of such business.(c) Defendant executed the written agreement of April 26,1985 acknowledging his indebtedness to plaintiff for her services andfurther acknowledging that all property, both real and personal, asdescribed in Attachment #C to said agreement was to be consideredproperty owned jointly by plaintiff and defendant LaVey.- 1454 -(d) Plaintiff has suffered and continues to sufferirreparable financial loss by reason of being denied access to the jointly-owned property for purposes of use or sale.(4) In the alternative, should this court not enforce the saidagreements, plaintiff, by reason of the facts heretofore alleged, has suffereddamages in excess of $500,000. The exact amount of said damages has notbeen presently ascertained by plaintiff, who will ask leave of the court toamend this complaint to insert the exact amount upon ascertainment ofsame or according to proof.69. No adequate remedy, other than herein prayed for, exists by whichthe rights of the parties hereto may be determined.70. Plaintiff desires a judicial determination of the rights, duties,obligations, and interests of the parties and a further determination of thevalidity of the agreement of the parties.Wherefore plaintiff prays for relief as follows:1. Under the First Cause of Action:(a) For actual and special damages according to proof.2. Under the Second Cause of Action:(a) For enforcement of the agreement of the parties as regardsdivision of the property.(b) For actual and special damages according to proof.(c) For attorney’s fees and costs incurred herein.3.

Under the Seventh Cause of Action:(a) For partition of the real property according to the respectiverights of the parties.(b) For division of the real property by sale and for division of theproceeds of sale according to the respective rights of the parties.(c) For reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by plaintiff inprosecuting this action for the common benefit of the parties.(d) For all costs of suit.8. Under the Eighth Cause of Action:(a) For a determination of the validity of the agreement of theparties.(b) For a judicial determination of the rights, duties, obligations,and interests of the parties.9.

I am a named defendant in the above-entitled action.2. I have read the Verified Answer to the Verified First AmendedComplaint filed by plaintiff Diane Hegarty, and the same is true of my ownknowledge except as to those matters stated on information and belief; andas to those matters I believe them to be true.I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State ofCalifornia that the foregoing is true and correct.Executed on June 1, 1989 at San Francisco, California./s/ Anton S. LaVey- 1462 -- 1463 -Appendix 155: Superior Court OrderSeptember 27, 1991Superior Court of the State of CaliforniaCity and County of San FranciscoNumber 891863Diane Hegarty, Plaintiffv.Anton LaVey, DefendantOrder denying defendant’s motions to set aside defaultand for new trial, and explanation of decisionDefendant’s motions for new trial and to set aside default judgmentmust be denied.1. Entry of default - Order of July 7, 1990.The entry of default was made by the court as a result of defendant’sfailure to participate in reasonable discovery. The order sanctioneddefendant for misconduct and not because he had neglected to answer andappear in the action.The motion under §473 of the Code of Civil Procedure patently lacksmerit because:a. It is not timely. The law requires that the application to set asidedefault must be made within six months after the order was taken. Overeleven months elapsed before defendant took any action. This alone issufficient to deny his application.b. Defendant’s application is not accompanied by any pleading.Obviously defendant would have a difficult time alleging he has ameritorious defense when his pleading has been stricken by the court forhis unmeritorious conduct.c. There has been no excusable neglect, mistake, or surprise on the partof anyone. A complete examination of the file, as well as all of thedocuments produced in this proceeding reveal that defendant was fullyapprised of everything that occurred.d. Defendant’s attorney did not abandon him on the eve of trial.Defendant signed a substitution of attorney on December 12, 1989.- 1464 -Thereafter defendant received notices but did not hire an attorney untilAugust 14, 1991. Significantly, when defendant received notice of thiscourt’s order of August 5, 1991, there apparently was no problem in findinga competent, enthusiastic attorney who managed to have his motions onfile six days after being hired.Furthermore there is no sworn affidavit from the former attorney, Mr.Mayer, as required by §473 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In such affidavitthe attorney is required to attest that he caused the defendant’s defaultthrough inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. Mr. Own Mayer is listed in the1991 directory of San Francisco lawyers at 44 Montgomery Street. He islikewise listed in the San Francisco telephone book at page 441. There cantherefore be no contention that he is unavailable.The court specifically finds that the default did not result from thesupposed mistake, inadvertence, or surprise of Mr. Mayer.e. Defendant’s medical condition: Defendant’s supposed poor healthdoes not qualify as an excusable neglect. He has provided no medicalrecords or declarations of medical doctors regarding the state of his healthfor the period prior to May 12, 1990, when he refused to submit to adeposition. In fact the medical records and declarations provided by thedefendant show that he could have been deposed during this time.His records show that he was admitted to Children’s Hospitalemergency room on May 12, 1990 and was diagnosed with mild congestiveheart failure; that his last EKG was in 1981; and that since that timedefendant “did relatively well, with symptoms occurring in the last week toten days”. He attributes his high blood pressure to “white coathypertension” in that his pressures would be 140 systolic at home at 180 inthe doctor’s office. At Children’s he was prescribed reduced activity, heartdiet, and follow-up checkups. No hypertensive medications had beenprescribed for many years.On June 22, 1990 defendant was admitted to San Francisco GeneralHospital with similar symptoms and was diagnosed with congestive heartfailure, not cardiac arrest. The hospital records state that defendant “was inhis usual state of health until three weeks ago” and that “he is resistantt o m o s t e f f o r t s b y p h y s i c i a n s t o i n i t i a t e m e d i ca ltherapy” (emphasis added).Defendant has provided no other medical records, but has produced aprescription per request of his secretary dated August 20, 1991 fordefendant to avoid “unnecessary stress”.- 1465 -This court does not feel that this litigation can be avoided as anunnecessary stress. Aside from this self-serving declaration, defendant hasprovided nothing regarding his medical condition after July 3, 1990. Ofinterest, however, is a declaration stating that defendant was “on locationfor a video shoot sometime between November 1989 and September 1991,and that he ‘delivered a flawless performance even when stricken with theflu’”.This court therefore finds that the defendant’s health was not the causeof his failure to attend to his legal business.2. Intrinsic fraud or mistake which prevented defendant fromparticipating in the court proceedings.Defendant urges that there was some sort of “secret” agreementregarding his deposition which prevented him from participating in thecourt proceedings. However he admits in his declaration that he receivednotices after the substitution of attorneys was filed in December 1989, butthat he turned over the entire responsibility of the lawsuit to BlancheBarton, his secretary. Barton states in her declaration that she had “noknowledge of deadlines”; however she corresponded with plaintiff’sattorney regarding the notices of defendant’s deposition and the notice ofentry of default. Barton even sent $20 in payment of the $956 sanctionswhich defendant was apprised of in the notice of entry of default. At thispoint defendant had six months to move to set aside the default, andjudgment on the default was not entered for another year.Barton also states that she continued to receive mail directed todefendant in 1990 and 1991. Upon receipt of the notice of entry ofjudgment, she “promptly” obtained counsel.For the first time defendant and his secretary state in their declarationsproblems with mailbox vandalism. In all of the documents between theparties over the past two years, there was no mention of this problem. Infact, if there were such problems, defendant’s daughter could notreasonably rely upon the fact that she received no correspondence from theplaintiff’s attorney in response to her letter of August 30, 1990 regarding aconservatorship. It was certainly not plaintiff’s responsibility to monitordefendant’s mailbox.Defendant declares that he sent a letter to a judge on April 23, 1990,but he does not say what judge or provide a copy of the letter as an exhibit.- 1466 -Of particular interest is a letter dated June 6, 1990 from Barton toplaintiff’s attorney. This letter made reference to plaintiff’s demands andthe subject property agreement, and proposed an alternate settlement plan.This letter also threatens plaintiff with action by “blind zealots” ofdefendant’s church should she persist with her lawsuit.Thus defendant’s contention that there was intrinsic fraud whichprevented him from participating in this lawsuit plainly has no merit. Hesays: “I avoided any involvement with the pending lawsuit, assuming that itwould be postponed until I was able to recover enough to submit to courtproceedings, and that if anything happened I would be treated fairly.”3. The August 5, 1991 prove-up hearing:Notices of all proceedings were served on defendant by mail. He nowasserts, however, that he should have been personally served with astatement of damages pursuant to §425.11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.§425.11 requires such a statement of damages, before a default judgmentmay be taken, in a personal injury or wrongful death action. Plaintiff’saction is primarily for breach of contract, specific performance, fraud anddeceit, rescission, partition, declaratory relief, and emotional distress. Thejudgment of August 5, 1991 did not award any damages for emotionaldistress. Thus this court finds that the plaintiff’s cause of action foremotional distress is incidental. Where an emotional distress claim isincidental to the case, it will not be considered “an action to recoverdamages for personal injury”. (Cf. Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc., 53 Cal.3d428, 432 (2a).)Therefore the defendant was not entitled to personal service of astatement of damages. This is not the ordinary case where a defendant hasmerely failed or neglected to answer a complaint. Here the defendant notonly answered, but he filed his own cross-complaint. There is therefore noreason to give him “one last clear chance” to respond inasmuch as it hasalready been determined that he is not entitled to any further privilegesbecause of his own misconduct. Like the court of appeal in Beeman v.Burling, 216 Cal.App.3d 1586, 1594, this trial court can see no reason torequire service of a statement of damages on a person who has alreadyappeared in the case and who has been found guilty of disregarding theprocedure of the court and the duties of a diligent, good-faith litigant.Finally no irregularity can be found in the default or the trialproceedings. However, even if there were something procedurally wrong- 1467 -with the manner in which the August 5th judgment were entered, thedefendant has forfeited his right to appear and defend. His answer has beenstricken, and his default was entered long ago. Thus, even if the court wereto set aside the August 5th judgment, nothing beneficial to the defendantwould accrue. All the court can do is order the plaintiff to send out anothernotice of time and place of trial and then proceed with the testimony allover again. Defendant would have no right to participate in that trial. Itwould be a waste of time.4. The prayer and body of the complaint:Although not addressed in defendant’s moving papers, it appears thatthe only relevant issue in this case is the fact that the prayer of plaintiff’sfirst amended complaint did not specifically quantify damages. (§425.10(b),Code Civ. Proc.)The first amended complaint did specify amounts in the body of thecomplaint in the 4th, 6th, and 8th causes of action, but defendant’sdemurrer was sustained as to the 4th and 8th causes of action. Defendantsubsequently answered. The court must now determine if the monetaryamount in the judgment awarded to plaintiff is limited to $300,000 asspecifically stated in the 6th cause of action.In Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. , 27 Cal.3d 489, 494 the SupremeCourt had before it a case involving breach of a construction contract. Thedefendants failed to respond to the complaint, and a default judgment wasentered. Over eight months after entry of the judgment, the defendantsmoved to vacate the judgment on the ground that it exceeded the court’sjurisdiction under §580 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The motion wasgranted by the trial court. The Supreme Court, in remanding the case withinstructions, pointed out that the motion was not timely under §473 of theCode of Civil Procedure; however that a collateral attack was appropriate ifthe trial court actually had no power to enter a default judgment other thanin conformity with §580. The prayer in the Becker case requestedcompensatory damages in an amount in excess of $20,000 and punitivedamages of $100,000. The body of the complaint was for $20,000compensatory damages. The Supreme Court concluded that the trial courtexceeded its authority by entering a judgment for $26,457 and ordered it tomodify the judgment by striking the award of damages in excess of$20,000.- 1468 -In Greenup v. Rodman, 42 Cal.3d 822, 829, 830 the Supreme Courthad before it a case similar to the instant case. In Greenup the defendant’sanswer was stricken as a sanction for discovery abuses in a disputeinvolving a minority shareholder’s complaint. In the prayer of thecomplaint, plaintiff requested $100,000 in exemplary and punitivedamages and other damages “in a sum that exceeds the jurisdictionalrequirements” of the superior court. The Court of Appeal held that thedefault for discovery violations exempted the case from the limit ondamages on default judgments. The Supreme Court reversed, declaring thata default judgment exceeding the demand must be reduced to conform tothe limitations specified in §580 of the Code of Civil Procedure.It is to be noted, however, that the present case differs in many respectsfrom the above Supreme Court decisions. In the first place plaintiff’sattorney did serve on defendant a statement of damages. Secondly thecomplaint here is specific about the other relief demanded. Plaintiff wantsher share of a residence and a business, and that is exactly what this courthas ordered except for $47,000 for rents, $30,000 for attorney’s fees, and$175,000 punitive damages.Also of interest here is the case of Mikail v. Sauerwald, 227 Cal.App.3d1090. This was an action for personal injuries wherein the defendantanswered, but her answer was stricken because of discovery misdeeds. Adefault judgment was entered for $250,000, but upon defendant’s motionit was reduced to $25,000. Since it was a personal injury case, the trialcourt and the Court of Appeal felt that a statement of damages had to bepersonally served on the defendant. The statement was in fact served ondefendant’s attorney. The Supreme Court granted review in Mikail; onAugust 8th of this year, however, it was dismissed as having improvidentlybeen granted pursuant to Rule 29.4 and was remanded to the Court ofAppeal. On September 5, 1991 the Court of Appeal readmitted the case tothe trial court with instructions to reinstate the plaintiff’s originaljudgment.In light of the above discussion, there appears to be some ambiguity inthe decisional law where there is only a monetary judgment. In the presentcase, however, we need not be overly concerned about the actual money,except for the amount of the attorney’s fees. The amount of punitivedamages is appropriate because it does not exceed more than three timesthe actual damages. Defendant cannot in any manner content that he didnot have actual notice of what plaintiff was demanding. She filed acomplaint and an amended complaint to which defendant responded. He- 1469 -was well aware of what was at stake from the outset of this litigation. Hewas given notice of the prove-up hearing. Yet in spite of having two monthsto obtain counsel, no one - not defendant, his personal secretary, nor hisdaughter Karla - appeared for that hearing.Accordingly this court finds that plaintiff’s judgment is valid andshould not be set aside, except that there should be a hearing on theamount of attorney’s fees awarded to plaintiff’s attorney.Finally, for future reference and possible review by the Court of Appeal,this court specifically finds that defendant’s conduct has been calculatedand designed to prevent plaintiff from obtaining her rights to the jointly-owned real and personal property. He has disobeyed a court order and hassuffered the consequences. He now seeks relief from the very court forwhich he has shown contempt in the past. The August 5, 1991 judgment hascaused him to change his mind about the court system, but it does notappear that the law requires this court to help him at his late awakening.Order:Defendant’s motions for new trial and to set aside default and defaultjudgment are denied. Plaintiff on motion is entitled to an award ofreasonable attorney’s fees for services performed during the litigation,including resisting the present proceeding.Dated: September 27, 1991/s/ Ollie Marie-VictoireJudge of the Superior Court- 1470 -- 1471 -Appendix 156: Church of Satan Articles of IncorporationFiled in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California,September 20, 1971Edmund J.

I just wanted to ask you what happened to the property thatis described in Attachment C as jointly-owned personal property.AL:Some of the property is no longer present or in existence.

My only point isthat when you signed this, you said that this was property ownedby you and Ms. Hegarty?AL:That’s correct. Uh, there was some discrepancy. Uh, I don’t wish toopen the case in this particular forum, as I believe this is not theplace to discuss this.SB:We’ll be glad to go over this list with you.JG:Okay, that’s fine. In fact I have a few more questions. I notice thatyou list as a liability an amount of $291,800, and I would like toknow how you arrived at that figure. It’s on the Summary ofSchedules page. The eighth page in.SB:Well, this - We did the best we could to go through the judgmentthat you had and understand what was what, and, uh, that was ourunderstanding that part of Ms. Hegarty’s claim was her one-halfinterest in the property. So we listed, uh, what we perceived as theunsecured portion of her judgment. That may be more or lessmoney there.JG:Okay, that’s fine. Um, and I have just one last question. Um, Mr.LaVey, how do you propose to satisfy the judgment against youthat is now held by Ms. Hegarty?AL:In whatever way it can be feasibly handled and amenably resolved.I do not have any specifics because I would not be here today if Iwere in a position of solvency to, uh, meet these claims.JG:Okay, that’s fine. I have nothing further at this time.UST:Do you have a card? I have a few other questions from the U.S.Trustee’s Office. Um, what is the full value of the California Streetproperty?- 1480 -SB:We have gotten an estimate done, an appraisal by, uh, PrudentialRealtors.UST:That’s great. You can just give me an estimate.SB:All right. Well, they had it after, uh, deduction for repairs thatwould be required at $295,000.JG:I’m sorry, what was that figure?SB:$295,000.JG:If it’s at all helpful to the court, we also have an appraisal of$420,000 for the property.UST:Okay. And who was the appraisal done by?SB:Uh, this was done by, uh, Prudential Real Estate Affiliates.UST:Mr. LaVey, have you transferred any personal or real propertywithin the last year?AL:No.UST:And do you hold any, uh, property - real or personal property - forany other persons at this time of any significant value?AL:I wouldn’t say substantial value.UST:And do you have interest in any of these that you’re holding foranyone else?AL:No.UST:Okay. That concludes the questions. Are there any other creditorswishing to ask questions of Mr. LaVey? Okay. Um, there arereporting requirements, um, by the U.S. Trustee’s Office. One ofthem is that we need proof of a debtor possession account,showing that you’ve closed your old bank accounts and opened upnew debtor possession accounts, um, proof of insurance on theresidence, um, any other property, and your tax returns. Otherthan that, those are the only two reporting requirements thatyou’re delinquent on. Also you have to file operating reports. Inview of the fact that you might not have an income, we still need tohave a cash-flow statement and the questionnaire filled out andsubmitted every month. If you have questions on those, give us acall. We’ll help you. Quarterly fees the same way. If you have aquestion on how to calculate how those fees are dispersed andpaid, we can help you on that. But if you fail to file any one of thosereporting requirements, the U.S. Trustee’s Office does go for amotion to dismiss or convert the case. Okay?AL:I understand.UST:This concludes the case of Anton LaVey.- 1481 -Appendix 158: Order for 6114 California StreetBankruptcy SaleUnited States Bankruptcy CourtNorthern District of CaliforniaChapter 7 Case No. 91-34251TCIn Re: Anton Szandor LaVey, DebtorEx Parte Application For Entry Of OrderAuthorizing Sale Of Real PropertyMarch 10, 1993 (Filed March 15, 1993)Charles E.

CarlsonThomas E. CarlsonUnited States Bankruptcy Judge- 1492 -- 1493 -Appendix 161: Review - The Devil’s Notebook- by Michael A. Aquino VI°August 16, XXVIII/1993Anton LaVey’s fourth book, The Devil’s Notebook, was published as apaperback in 1992 by Feral House, the same “skinhead market”-orientedcompany which had previously released his [auto]biography Secret Life of aSatanist and the Satanic Witch reissue of his Compleat Witch. DNappeared quietly on the market, was carried by only a few bookstores, andas of this date seems to have all but disappeared from circulation.Arguably it does not deserve such a non-reception. It consists of aselection of Anton LaVey’s essays from the Cloven Hoof, and withoutexception these make for lively reading. Unfortunately, like Anton’s otherbooks, DN suffers from the stigma on his name resulting from the SatanicBible’s being accused so loudly and emphatically as the textbook for “occultcrime” in the international witch-hunt frenzy of the 1980s. As a result, mostmainstream bookstores simply don’t want to court public-relationsproblems by carrying LaVey books, and apparently the book-reviewcommunity shies away from even “noticing” them, much less praising them,as well. In his introduction to DN, Feral House’s Adam Parfrey complainssomewhat petulantly about this ostracism:Although his books have sold over a million copies, the publishingindustry has chosen to ignore Anton LaVey. The book trade publication,Publishers Weekly, has never reviewed a publication by or about Anton LaVey.Aside from the occasional hysteria-inciting pieces that attempt to “expose” or“debunk” the founder of the Church of Satan, the print and electronic mediahave chosen to enforce a blackout on the true nature of his writings. Most ofthe so-called “alternative” press has taken the lead of the mainstream pressnot to confront the work or life of Anton LaVey, to wish him into nonexistence.Why? In a word, fear. The mainstream fears Christian opprobrium andridicule. The politically correct individual fears the rapacity of his own id.Occultnicks are threatened by LaVey’s refusal to indulge their penchant forobscurantist mumbo jumbo. 956Parfrey’s thesis - that Anton is deliberately “not noticed” because he istoo brilliant and impressive - is doubtless the excuse that every frustratedauthor prefers to nurse. But in this case, as in most others, it is wide of themark. As intrinsically creative and colorful as Anton LaVey’s personal956 “The True Nativity- and Proof Beyond a Shadow”, Cloven Hoof #III-3, AprilVI/1971.- 1494 -opinions may be, the factor that once made them important to society wasthat they came from someone who supposedly headed a large internationalreligious institution dedicated to promoting and defending such attitudesand concepts. Now that he is known to be just another eccentric individual -and the Church of Satan a long-extinct phenomenon - his opinions are asdispensable as those of any Hyde Park orator.For those who have experienced the 1966-75 Church of Satan [eitherpersonally or through this Church of Satan history], of course, the ClovenHoof essays in DN have a measurable significance. Here they are part of thelarger picture of the Age of Satan. Within The Church of Satan I haveextracted from a number of Anton’s CH essays, but have not reproducedany in their entirety in order to respect copyright “fair use” standards. DHis therefore a valuable supplement to this history, enabling one to readseveral complete essays - the ones which [from a 1992 perspective, at least]Anton considered his best.Even so a bit of decoding is needed. The essays in DN are not inchronological order, nor are they footnoted to the Hoof issues in which theyappeared. And of course no mention is made to the environment, within orwithout the Church of Satan, in which they were written.In this review I have sorted known essays into sequence, and assignedthem to five general time-periods. Obviously these periods overlap [exceptbetween #2 and #3]. Under the heading for each period I have placed theDN essays in chronological order. In front of each entry appears its numberas appearing in DN.The Cloven Hoof was edited by Anton & Diane LaVey from its firstissue in 1969 until November 1971, when I assumed the editorship. When Iresigned from the Church of Satan in June 1975, the LaVeys again jointlyedited the newsletter until 1986, when Diane ceased connections withAnton and the Church business after her 1984 departure from CaliforniaStreet.Diane’s final collaboration with Anton was the basic draft of DN,presumably the selection and revising of essays, for which she receives nomention whatever in the book as finally published. In their 1984 agreementAnton agreed to pay Diane 10% of any royalties from DN, and this wasreaffirmed in the closing court order regarding his 1991-1993 bankruptcy.- 1495 -1966-1971: The Emotional Church of SatanAt the time of its founding, and for the first few years when it remaineda local San Francisco institution, the Church took itself very literally in aprimitive, emotional context. The Devil and his Daemons were allconsidered to be living, sentient entities who were duly invoked in direct-discourse rituals. Anton wore a horned cowl in ritual, presided on a throne,and was idolized as a semi-supernatural being to be addressed as “YourExcellency”. He was held to be the “prophet” of Satan whose birthdayshould be considered “the true nativity”.957 In this period his essays for theCloven Hoof were imperial and dramatic.8.

There was a good deal of discussion concerningSatanism as a religion and philosophy beyond the literal images of theSatanic Bible. The original San Francisco group ceased to meet, with AntonLaVey now functioning as head of a far-flung organization. He was nowregarded less as a supernatural Devil and more as a sage: the founder of anew and evolutionary school of scientific and metaphysical thought. Hisown Satanic Rituals reinforced his image as a scholar whose perceptions ofSatanism went far beyond anti-Christian “Devil worship”. These essaysrepresent Anton at his most intellectual, and without the antisocialreclusiveness that would pervade his later works. He was a brilliant thinker,comfortable with his prominence in society, speaking to a national audienceof Church of Satan members who respected his views and invariablyengaged in lively discussions of them.- 1496 -25.

Two factors are evident inthe years immediately following this development: (1) Anton’s shock at thesudden, total collapse of the C/S because of his decision and (2) thedilemma he now faced because, when confronted for his prostitution of theC/S, he had denied the existence of Satan at all except as a dramaticmetaphor for his personal opinions. His essays now become defensive andbitter, lashing out at a world he feels to be unfair to him.6. THE GOODGUY BADGE.Cloven Hoof #VII-4, July-August X/1975.- 1497 -3.

TIME TO START KICKING ASS.Cloven Hoof #XVIII-3, Autumn XX/1985.- 1499 -1985-1992: Anton LaVey - Social Critic IIWith the departure of Diane LaVey and her replacement by SharonDensley, all pretense of a functioning C/S disintegrated. After a fewintermittent, amateurishly-produced issues by Densley, the Cloven Hooffinally ceased publication in 1988. Diane, who had been with Anton fromthe pre-beginning days of the C/S, had been a stabilizing influence on himand his writings. Now, in reclusion, he was surrounded only by mesmerizedsycophants like Densley. His essays of alienation continue, becoming ifanything more bizarre. Now they are unpublished, awaiting, presumably,an airing in this DN book.27. EVANGELISTS VS. THE NEW GOD.Cloven Hoof #XX-2, XXII/1987.31.
