It asserts that Satanism is a unique philosophy distinctly tailored to man’s life on Earth which, if followed, has the po- tential to increase the follower’s earthly success. This paper investigates the Church of Satan, its ideology, and its practices, and observes that the Church of Satan includes the same dynamics as can be observed in many other religions. In addition, the Church of Satan appears to deliberately mislead its members via conflicting policy statements and com- munication. The paper concludes that the Church of Satan is a personality cult that seems to have less interest in maintaining an ideology than in gaining members, and that the Church of Satan may be no more than the invention of a skilled con artist who saw an un- used opportunity. 1. The Church of Satan and Its Ideology When Anton LaVey (1930-1997, born Howard Stanton Levey) founded the Church of Satan reporting Walpurgisnacht (April 31) in 1966 as its birthday, † the organization de- scribed the event as the “opening the floodgates to a revolution” and proclaimed the event as “Year One,” announcing a new era in History [1]. Anton LaVey had regularly studied occultism at home together with his so-called “Magic Cir- cle” of devotees a few years earlier, and it was this group that was to become the Church of Sa- tan [2, p.29]. Membership figures are kept secret by the Church of Satan, leaving friends and foes guess- ing at membership figures differing by several orders of magnitude. The membership card provides no indication of the size of the organi- zation, as all membership cards issued today display the number 100261 (see Figure 1) . While the actual membership number probably lies between the guesses of just a few hundred and several millions, and while the influence of the Church of Satan is probably less than hinted by the organization itself and more than reported by its enemies (anti-cult fanatics excluded), the Church of Satan has established itself as the or- ganization that is usually mentioned in books describing Satanism regardless of opinion. An- ton LaVey himself is usually mentioned in com- pany with names such as Eliphas Lévi, Abbé Boullard, and Aleister Crowley, all of whom are considered leading figures in so-called “tradi- tional” (or “religious,” or “mythical”) and “modern” Satanism. Hagiographies such as The Secret Life of a Sa- tanist [3] and The Church of Satan [4], both by the Church of Satan’s former High Priestess and Anton LaVey’s third wife, Blanche Barton ‡ (Grand Priestess of the Temple), provide a col- † 1966 coincided with “year one” declared in Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby . Anton LaVey claimed to have been involved in the 1968 movie production as both a technical advisor and as an actor. Neither claim is supported—neither the detailed biography of the m ovie nor the size of the costume for LaVey’s purported role lend credibility to the claim. ‡ Some critics have suggested that Blanche Barton’s hagiographies of Anton LaVey and his organization were not written by Barton but LaVey himself. Comparing the literary style of the books with her style after LaVey’s death lends credibility to Barton as t he orig- inal author, albeit strongly inspired by LaVey. Figure 1.

The strong publicity that the Church of Satan and its founder have received is itself no indica- tion that the Church of Satan represents Satan- ism beyond its own claim to the title as the Dev- il’s henchmen, however. It can be argued that because in certain aspects of its literature the Church of Satan references Christianity in its departure from the creeds usually associated with common Christian ide- ology, in that sense at least it qualifies as an an- ti-Christian organization and hence by Chris- tian definition, Satanic. In particular, the first section (most of which was adapted with few modifications from Ragnar Redbeard’s Might is Right [5]) of The Satanic Bible [6] by Anton LaVey has strong anti-Christian proclamations. Anton LaVey has later explained that this section was intended as an eye-opener [5, p.5]. 1.1 Satanic Ideology Anton LaVey has claimed inspiration from, and ideological parallels with, several sources with leanings toward atheistic or non-Christian morality, including Mark Twain, Jack London, P.T. Barnum, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ragnar Red- beard, Orrin Klapp, Niccolò Machiavelli, Charles Finney, Adolf Hitler, Charles Darwin, Ayn Rand, Herbert Spencer, H.G. Wells, Yefi- movitch Rasputin, George Bernard Shaw, Sig- mund Freud, Ambroce Bierce, Sir Basil Zaha- roff, and Voltaire, to name just a few [3, p.24; 5, p.5-6; 2, p.492, 741; 7, p.xii; 8, p.51; 9]. Satan- ism, according to the Church of Satan, is a fu- sion of the thoughts expressed by these authors and philosophers, etc.: [Anton LaVey’s] ideas evolved from his enthusiasm for Satanic sympathizers and reprobates like George Bern- hard Shaw, John Milton, Goethe, [...] peppered with a liberal dose of the Johnson, Smith & Co. Catalogue of Jokes, Tricks and Novelties. [7, p.xii] That is, although neither thought alone was novel, no one before Anton LaVey had connect- ed the dots to synthesize a new religion based on the thoughts combined. The Church of Satan’s ideology states that man alone is responsible for his own success, and that there is no reward in Heaven or pun- ishment in Hell for man’s intents and doings on Earth. As The Satanic Bible states: 1. Life is the great indulgence—death, the great absti- nence. Therefore, make the most of life— HERE AND NOW . 2. There is no heaven of glory bright, and no hell where sinners roast. Here and now is our day of torment! Here and now is our day of joy! Here and now is our opportunity. [6, p.33] Man is thus given with the chance to live in in- dulgence only while alive, and had better make full use of it while it lasts. † This is a recurring theme in the second section of The Satanic Bible . Followers of the Church of Satan are encour- aged to make that of Satanism which suits each individual follower’s best needs: As far as Satanists are concerned, taking the way things are and taking what suits you best and dwelling on it— that’s what it is all about. [10, p.234] The Church of Satan generally uses Satan as a symbol of man’s nature as that of any other ani- mal, and rejects the belief in Satan as an anthro- pomorphic being. Some of Anton LaVey’s clos- er associates, however, seem to have been told a different story. For example, Michael Aquino, who resigned from the Church of Satan and formed a new organization, The Temple of Set in 1975, explains that the belief in a literal Devil: ... was axiomatic to all of our [Aquino’s and LaVey’s] conversations and collaborations [11] and Blanche Barton explained to The San Fran- cisco Chronicle at a press conference following Anton LaVey’s death in 1997 that Anton LaVey had believed in the Devil [12]. In an article in The Occult Explosion Anton LaVey had acknowl- edged that: ...many members of the Church of Satan who are mys- tically inclined prefer to think of Satan in a very real, anthropomorphic way. Of course we do not discourage this, because we realize that it is very important to many individuals to ritualistically conceptualize a well-wrought picture of their mentor or tutelary divini- ty. [2, p.740] He ventured on to explain that: In answer to those who would label us “Devil worship- pers” or ... Satan worshippers, I must say that Satan demands study , not worship. [2, p.740] Note that Anton LaVey did not reject the belief in Satan, only the worship of the deity. The Satanic Bible defines Satan somewhat am- biguously as a unified God (that is, not a god among others) which: ... is seen as the balancing factor in nature, and not be- ing concerned with suffering. [6, p.40] † In contrast to popular opinion among Church of Satan followers there is no implication that there is no life after death; the te xt only states that once one is dead, one will be unable to indulge in one’s desires."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 3 of 30 and Most Satanists do not accept Satan as an anthropomor- phic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns. He merely represents a force of nature ... [which] is an untapped reservoir that few can make use of... [6, p.62] This definition, in conjunction with the term “god,” lends itself to a theistic or deistic percep- tion of Satan in addition to the atheistic persua- sion also presented in the book. The Church of Satan’s Grotto Master applica- tion requires prospective “Grotto Masters,” who are individuals that lead a local chapter of Church of Satan followers, to perform a self-ini- tiation ritual: 15. Before you complete this application—when you sense the time is right—perform a ritual (using the ba- sic elements described in The Satanic Bible ) to petition Satan and the Dark Legions to accept you as a Grotto Master. Write down the ritual you performed and the results, if any. [13] Again, this ritual, requesting an infernal man- date, has theistic overtones. Part of the Church of Satan’s ideology specifi- cally appeals to people that feel a need to bol- ster their egos, feeling that they are more impor- tant than their social recognition reflects. The Sa- tanic Bible provides a salt water injection to such people’s egos with the assertion that Satanists are intrinsically superior people. Church of Sa- tan literature, such as The Black Flame , bulge with racist, fascist, and Nazi-oriented essays and imagery, all of which are recurring themes among people whose self-esteem is out of pro- portion with their physical or intellectual abili- ties. Organizations promising religious or simi- lar emotionally gratifying compensation for lacking achievements thrive on such people. The Church of Satan acknowledges an emotion- al link between its ideology and Nazism: Barton: It’s an unholy alliance ... The anti-Christian strength of National Socialist Germany is part of the appeal to Satanists. ... LaVey: ... The aesthetics of National Socialism and Sa- tanism dovetail. [10, p.236] Anton LaVey states in The Satanic Bible that there is evidence of an emerging Satanic age. At that time there was increasing focus on personal freedom, relaxed sexual morals, rebellion against authorities, and iconoclastic behavior, all cardinal to the hippie movement that was gaining foothold in the years before the Church of Satan was created. The first three clauses in the Church of Satan’s official, semi-political pro- gram, Pentagonal Revisionism , which was pub- lished in The Devil’s Notebook [14, p.93] demand stratification (which is a form of meritocracy that rejects undeserved power), taxation of churches, and separation of church and state. These issues were also important in the “free- dom movement” of the 1960es. Interest in An- ton LaVey’s pet projects, the construction of ar- tificial human companions and total environ- ments (i.e., fantasy worlds) had already peaked a decade earlier when robots were the big hit on the screen and popular literature, and the con- temporary fashion dictated a new home with a characteristic departure from traditional fur- nishing. Whether the evidence reflected a “zeitgeist” that was genuinely indicative of an emerging Satanic age or whether Anton LaVey simply de- fined social trends at that time as Satanic is diffi- cult to tell. However, lending itself well to the prevalent social trends the Church of Satan was certainly a product of its time. 1.2 The Satanic Bible The Satanic Bible formally defines the Church of Satan’s ideology, and the Church of Satan re- fers to the book as: a diabolical book, the basis for our philosophy. [1] The book was released in 1969, three years af- ter the establishment of the Church of Satan. Anton LaVey explains that he was prompted to write The Satanic Bible by his agent and publish- er’s suggestion with a tight deadline: Then [...] came the official commission to write a “Sa- tanic Bible”. My agent and publisher wanted the mate- rial I had already printed in tract form, with additional stuff, to make up the “Bible” as quickly as possible. [5, p.4] The Satanic Bible is comprised of, in the follow- ing order: 1. An anti-Christian diatribe. This section seems to appeal especially to those that were brought up in Christian homes and are fed up with that religion. The Church of Satan explains that this section is a wake-up call that is only necessary for some readers. 2. A level-headed refutation of Christian dog- ma; an assertion that there is no afterlife and hence no reward or punishment after one dies; and elaborations on different facets of a life lived accordingly. This section contains many examples of how even seemingly con- flicting behavior is Satanic according to the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 4 of 30 author, and effectively virtually any behavior is inherently Satanic. 3. Three recipes for magic focusing on aggres- sion, lust, and compassion. The magic in the third section obviously appeals to people that enjoy magic settings, but the Church of Satan accepts that some followers do not feel so inclined. The Church of Satan states that belief in liter- al demons is permitted within the confines of the ritual chamber and abandoned outside of the chamber. Presumably this argument also holds in rituals such as “The Satanic ‘Bap- tism,’” [15, p.212] which directly refers to the literal Satan. It is a valid argument, but the dual acceptance of belief and non-belief is al- so an effective tool for appealing to such strongly diverging groups of people as the- ists and atheists simultaneously. 4. A listing of eighteen “Enochian Keys.” Ironi- cally, this section contains the very occult- nick bunk that Anton LaVey prides The Sa- tanic Bible as being devoid of in the preface of the book. Both readers despising such bunk- ery and readers desiring it are generously satisfied. The Satanic Bible thus represents an occultnick slam dunk: most readers will agree with certain portions of The Satanic Bible as long as they are either atheists on a rational level, deists with symbolism but no supernatural beliefs, or even theists believing in God and/or Satan but not particularly caring about their sentences in their afterlives. Indeed, because most readers can find some- thing they agree with in The Satanic Bible almost regardless of personal belief, and because they are encouraged to pick and choose those items they agree with, the only obstacle to being a Sa- tanist per the Church of Satan’s requirements lies in the readers’ potential unwillingness to ac- cept the label “Satanist.” This conclusion is sup- ported by Blanche Barton’s welcoming state- ment on the official Church of Satan Web page, where she explains that: The philosophy really isn’t that esoteric and doesn’t take much pondering to understand. But it’s that loom- ing figure in the shadows, that majestic silhouette of Satan—leathery wings outstretched, standing proudly, backlit by the flames of Hell—that people find... dis- quieting. [16] Church of Satan officials have argued that parts of the The Satanic Bible were intended as sincere philosophy while other parts were in- tended to mislead the rubes begging to be mocked and derided. According to William Gidney (Priest of the Church of Satan): The Church of Satan champions the Machiavellian eth- ic of misdirection: You should try actually reading the philosophical content of The Satanic Bible far more carefully. What confusion we inspire is of no interest to us. [17] Hence, the inclusion of the so-called Enochian Keys, a hoax invented by John Dee and Edward Kelley, in The Satanic Bible might be an ironic at- tempt at misdirection put there to confuse the rubes, but any references to Machiavellian eth- ics would be sincere. Presumably only the elite (that is, whoever happened to read The Satanic Bible ) would be able to realize that the Crowley- inspired parts were misdirection, while the Redbeard and Machiavelli musings were sin- cere—or vice versa. Each follower of the Church of Satan is left with the impression that he or she and a few others understand the true mean- ing of Satanism, and everyone else does not. It is more plausible, however, that when An- ton LaVey wrote The Satanic Bible , he decided to take a dash of Crowley (whose interest in Dee and Kelley is well documented) from here, and a dash of Machiavelli and Nietzsche from there, and bake his Satanic cake appealing to the wid- est audience possible. The Church of Satan states that the contradic- tions are only apparent: It is then up to the rank and file members, as well as anyone else who has an interest in this material, to ana- lyze these ideas and synthesize the apparent contradic- tions into a “Third Side” that is the essence of Satanic understanding. [18] Or, in other words, the reason that there are contradictions is that there are none; and by perceiving the ideology as ambiguous, one has not gained Satanic understanding. As in Hans Christian Andersen’s popular story, The Emper- or’s New Clothes , where people would rather not admit to being stupid not seeing the emperor’s marvelous new (missing) clothes, followers of the Church of Satan would probably rather not admit they have no “Satanic understanding.” Inevitably individual Satanists will reach dif- ferent interpretations. The Church of Satan con- tinues: Will everyone arrive at the same synthesis? No. Sur- prised? You shouldn’t be, as Satanism is a religion which embraces the practice of individualism, not de- manding that all its members have some kind of lock- step sameness. [18]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 5 of 30 Different and contrary individual interpreta- tions do not warrant religious unity, however. People do not unite in dis agreement—not unless they join hands in a shared disagreement with something entirely different, such as Satanists’ pet demon: Christianity. If the Church of Satan does indeed unite its followers despite oppos- ing interpretations, their unity is not about its ideology at all. 1.3 Satanic Rituals and Magic The Satanic Bible formally defines magic as: The change in situations or events in accordance with one’s will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable. [6, p. 110] The statement echoes Aleister Crowley’s defi- nition, and in admitting to a rather broad defini- tion Anton LaVey refers to the equivalence be- tween the perception of magic and science, pos- sibly borrowing Athur C. Clarke’s famous Third Law, which stipulates that “[a]ny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Most interpretations ranging from mys- ticism to die hard science are thereby covered. Anton LaVey asserted that magic falls into three basic categories: anger, lust, and compas- sion [6, pp. 114-115]—feelings that are often dif- ficult to cope with in many societies. Two sec- tions of The Satanic Bible are devoted to the prac- tice of magic. One section contains three recipes for the aforementioned three categories of mag- ic. The other section lists the Enochian Keys. Anton LaVey has later conceded that he chose to include the Enochian Keys in The Satanic Bible simply because he was told that they were dan- gerous to mention [5, p.4]. When the Church of Satan uses the term “cere- mony,” it means “ritual” in sociology. When it uses the term “ritual,” it means “magic” in soci- ology. This document uses the sociological no- menclature. The rituals and magic that are publicly avail- able—the three basic types in The Satanic Bible and the ones in The Satanic Rituals —are free to use by anyone. The three basic types of magic can be performed solitarily, and can be expected to be the most widespread Satanic magic based on the ease of performance, and on the few ritu- al settings and/or participants required. The Church of Satan’s rituals, as explained by Anton LaVey in The Satanic Rituals , are intended to sustain the Satanic ideology: Generally, a ritual [i.e., magic] is used to attain , while a ceremony [i.e., a ritual] serves to sustain . [15, p.17] Rituals serve as self-programming devices that maintain the follower’s dedication to the reli- gion, and they have a transfusing effect on the person’s life. The Satanic Rituals includes the following ritu- als: 1. Le Messe Noir —a rite of passage intended to rid the follower of Catholic Christian dogma. 2. L’air Epais —an initiation ritual in which the participant symbolically dies and is reborn as a Satanist. 3. Das Tierdrama —a reminder of one’s animal heritage. 4. Homage to Tchort —draws inspiration from Russian folklore of various demons, which are summoned during the ritual. 5. The Ceremony of the Nine Angles —inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, it is intended to “emphasize potential.” 6. The Call to Cthulhu —also inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, it “reflects the dimness of an al- most forgotten past.” 7. The Satanic Baptisms —baptism rituals for chil- dren and adults. Rituals 4, 5, and 6 have no clear purpose. Michael Aquino, the author of rituals 5 and 6, explains that the fledgling organization’s theory regarding rituals was not all that deep or thought-through, and that the purpose of some rituals was only to act as a vehicle for the emo- tional or intellectual stimulation or pleasure of the participants [11]. Given no explanation of their purpose in The Satanic Rituals , it is likely that these three rituals fall into that category. Rituals actualize ideology, that is, they are physical manifestations of the abstract thoughts expressed by the ideology. Like birthdays are times where the birthday celebrant may think ahead or back, rituals typically act as reflective moments where participants stop and relate to their nature and situation. Rituals are not con- sidered in the everyday life, but require partici- pants to stop and act . It is not clear how inspira- tion from Russian folklore and Lovecraftian fic- tion actualizes the Satanic ideology as outlined in The Satanic Bible . It is remarkable that rites of passage, such as wedding and death, admission to adulthood (the Church of Satan has a concept of children vs. adults, as evidenced by The Satanic Baptisms , which come in those two forms), etc. are absent from the available material. Such rituals serve to sustain a religion and reinforce its ideology."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 6 of 30 Michael Aquino’s explanation above is believ- able, but after 36 years of existence it is surpris- ing to conclude that rituals that actualize the ideology still have that little weight. This topic is discussed further in Section 1.4, Lacking Ritu- als . A complete analysis of the Church of Satan’s rituals is beyond the scope of this article, but compared with rituals known from other reli- gions the Church of Satan’s rituals are consider- ably shallow: there is only limited correspon- dence between the Church of Satan’s ideology and what the rituals actualize; the rituals do not meet common needs; and they are based on terse research, not in-depth refinements and studies. The Church of Satan’s magic consists of substi- tute actions for goals that the participant cannot readily attain in real life. In keeping with the notion of living here and now, magic in The Sa- tanic Bible concentrates on meeting very short term goals, eliminating present frustration with sexual desire, aggression, or compassion, as mentioned earlier: † 1. Lust magic—to get sex. 2. Destruction magic—to get revenge. 3. Compassion magic—to help someone. The Satanic Rituals adds the following magic: 4. Die elektrischen [sic] Vorspiele —magic intend- ed to produce far-reaching, social changes. 5. The Statement of Shaitan —magic intended to influence human events. Presumably it is left to the magician’s discre- tion which social changes or influences are de- sired in this magic, because The Satanic Rituals provides no description. There seems to be no magic for individual long term goals. When a follower performs magic or rituals in solitude, the follower is not quite alone. Like when a believer in stone healing clenches his hands around a translucent stone and whispers a prayer by himself knowing that many other believers also do this, it creates a sense of com- munity and belonging, even if each believer is alone. The followers may be alone, but they are alone— together . Such magic and rituals bind the followers to- gether much like a regular church community does, only without the social interaction. The knowledge that others perform the very same rituals also creates the belief that the ritual is more important, or more effective, than if it were a home made ritual. The follower gets the impression that his behavior is meaningful, and it gains validity by social proof (i.e., the as- sumption that if many do it, it is inherently cor- rect or makes sense). Social proof also persuades people to engage in a behavior that they would not otherwise have displayed. Dressing up funny is less em- barrassing in a group of similarly dressed peo- ple than alone, for example; and followers that feel awkward about a ritual would similarly feel encouraged to complete it anyway knowing that many others do it. The effect is self-perpet- uating. The Church of Satan’s solitary rituals thus contribute to a sense of solidarity and commu- nity, and they satisfy the followers’ desire for rituals, if any. 1.4 Lacking Rituals As of this writing, the Church of Satan is 36 years old according to its reported foundation date, and obviously the religion has not yet had time to evolve significantly. It is nonetheless striking that certain elements of the religion that are often absent in new religions are still miss- ing. A religion that is more than a generation old should have had its share already of couples desiring to get married or individuals that have passed away. A wedding ritual has been writ- ten [2, p.604], but for all practical purposes it does not exist. ‡ In spite of an expected demand, rituals concerning marriage and death are thus effectively still absent. * Of rituals traditionally classified as rites of passage—events such as birth, marriage, and death—only (voluntary) baptism rituals are available for initiation of † It is a religious question whether this magic actually works, but if the chief purpose of the magic is to vent frustrations and “get it out of one’s system,” the magic probably has some self-therapeutic value. ‡ The wedding ritual may have been published in past issues of the Church of Satan’s newsletter, The Cloven Hoof , but back issues prior to no. 126 are not available. The ritual is reproduced in Michael Aquino’s The Church of Satan [2, p.604], but this book is not en- dorsed by the Church of Satan. The Church of Satan Web site explains which Enochian keys (listed in The Satanic Bible ) are associated with different types of rituals, and associates keys 2, 7, and 13 with lust and weddings and key 11 with funerals, according to Anton LaVey [19]. Hence, a preparation for such rituals is available, but the rituals themselves are not available for the followers. * Rituals concerning marriage and death may be said to be irrelevant to Satanism and therefore now ignored, but because religious people tend to carry old socio-religious habits with them as spiritual baggage when they switch religions, marriage and funeral are guaranteed to be a concern."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 7 of 30 new followers. This one, and rituals for mar- riage, funerals, etc. would generally be the first ones to be made available for the followers of a religion. The effective absence of such rituals even to- day suggests that followers of the Church of Sa- tan either abandon their religion quickly or do not take their religion particularly seriously in spite of their sometimes quite belligerent out- ward determination. Alternatively, it is a sign that the Church of Satan’s headcount is too low to enable such social events (couples never form, and friends or family members that die are never Satanists), or that the religion is strict- ly individualistic. The latter can be said to fit the Church of Satan’s statement that the religion is individualistic, but it is improbable that two fol- lowers are so individualistic that they refuse to marry, and that they refuse to use their pre- ferred religion in that situation. The lacking rituals indicate that the religion has yet to make a lasting impact, but a need for such rituals may eventually arise if followers gain interest or the religion gains momentum, depending on the reason why the rituals are lacking. Possibly the Church of Satan considers the only existing ritual too embarrassing for wide publication: the wedding ritual by Anton LaVey is unimpressive and quite short—about half a page—and devoid of virtually any effects. Section 3, Active Recruiting , argues that the Church of Satan is motivated to recruit new fol- lowers, but existing followers are mostly dead- wood in an economic and administrative sense, useful only as recruitment agents and combat units. It is therefore possible that the Church of Satan’s primary interest lies in recruiting fol- lowers (who will be looking for Satanic baptism rituals), but its desire to keep followers (who will be looking for wedding, funeral, and other simi- lar rituals) is slim or even against its own inter- est. The Church of Satan explains that a wedding ritual can only be performed by a Church of Sa- tan appointed official: The Official marriage Rite used by the Church of Satan was authored by High Priest Gilmore and is not avail- able online or to members or the public. It is now only presented to members of the Priesthood of Mendes who are about to perform it. [20] The explanation also reveals that apparently the original wedding ritual by Anton LaVey has now been replaced with a new one by Peter Gilmore (High Priest of the Church of Satan), which according to the Church of Satan is to be published in Peter Gilmore’s planned book, Sa- tanic Scriptures † [20]. This requirement ostensibly provides the Church of Satan with an ability to exercise a cer- tain control, albeit very limited in scope, or the Church of Satan may be keeping the ritual pri- vate to make it seem tantalizing as “forbidden fruit.” Whatever the reason, the Church of Satan evidently does not expect its followers to heed its own warning in the Satanic Bunco Sheet : 2. Look out for jargon and secrets to which only the “initiated” can be privy. Once you’re processed through the lengthy and strictly-enforced “degree sys- tem,” you’ll discover there are really no answers, just more gobbledygook. [21] 2. A New Religion The Church of Satan has referred to its ideolo- gy as a religion [22]. Although the founder may have had ulterior motives as indicated in the following chapters, it is ultimately the behavior of the organization that determines whether the movement qualifies as a religion. The Sai Baba movement is a religion, for example, regardless of the motives and moral or legal integrity of the founder, whose “miracles” have been ex- posed as clumsy stage magic in video clips. The Church of Satan is organized as illustrated in Figure 2. At the top level of the organization, the core is comprised of a relatively small group of people, which handles administrative tasks and issues guidelines. The Church of Satan has historically referred to its core group as “The Council of Nine”: [T]he Council of Nine [...] is the ruling body of the orga- nization [1] It is not clear whether it is comprised of nine individuals, and who these individuals are, but recently the core group seems to have included Blanche Barton, Peter Gilmore, Peggy Nadramia (High Priestess), and Jeff Nagy (Mag- ister) [23]. Only the core group has decisive power. † Satanic Scriptures will reportedly be a compilation of essays written by Peter Gilmore in various magazines. If so, it will rese mble Anton LaVey’s The Devil’s Notebook and Satan Speaks! , which are both compilations of essays that Anton LaVey wrote in various magazines."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 8 of 30 The soldiers, at the second-highest level, fol- low the guidelines issued by the core and take strong interest in studying what they consider Satanic ideology. The core and the soldiers ac- tively “present” Satanism to the outside world. Soldiers are not organized, but seem to occa- sionally or regularly talk with core group indi- viduals. They are usually energetically loyal to the Church of Satan, as the following statement attests: I am 100% loyal to the Church of Satan, and to its offi- cials. I will obey WHATEVER and EVERY proclama- tion and regulation that they set forth within the CoS as a corporate body ... . ... And again, I declare my loyalty AND OBEDIENCE not only to the CoS as a body, but also to certain offi- cials such as HP Blanche Barton, Magister Peter H. Gilmore, ... [etc.]. They tell me to do something, and I do it...This is rare, but I am more than happy to do whatever they say. Any order they give me would nev- er be for my detriment, only for my good. [24] One level further down, interested followers have read The Satanic Bible and some other doc- uments. They pursue further knowledge in what they happen to consider Satanic, but are generally unaware of guidelines issued by the core and do not actively represent Satanism. Finally, the periphery is comprised of people that may have read The Satanic Bible and other documents but do not pursue other knowledge. Their membership of the Church of Satan has the same value to them as perhaps a piece of jewelry. This organizational structure is common among religious groups. The structure is not formalized in the Church of Satan, and only serves to understand the dynamics of the Church of Satan as a religious organization. 2.1 Characteristic Religious Traits The core and the soldiers display the charac- teristic traits of new religious movements founded by charismatic leaders: 1. They believe the founder can/could perform miracles or other supernatural feats, and the founder is perceived as somehow more than human. The founder is considered infallible, or the founder’s faults are ignored or ex- plained away. [25, pp.184-218] The founder, Anton LaVey, plays a key role in the religion. It is very common to find that fol- lowers of new religious groups, sects, or cults revere the founder as more than human, capa- ble of miracles (or, in the case of Anton LaVey, curses), etc. with very flattering hagiographies written about the founder’s life. They ignore rampant inconsistencies in the founder’s pro- fessed past † and perceive ordinary actions as ac- complishments only a demigod could have per- formed. They are quick to accredit general trends to the founder; for example, on the Church of Satan Web page Peter Gilmore con- tributes today’s pleasure-oriented culture to Anton LaVey: Indulgence was the “watchword” chosen by Anton LaVey when he founded the Church of Satan in 1966. I think a case may certainly be made that this concept has in the interim made a lasting impact on human so- ciety. As we look through the landscape of what is cur- rently offered, we see that Dr. LaVey’s vision has had broad cultural effect, as the amount of freedom for per- sonal pleasure has abundantly increased on all levels of social strata. [26] Anton LaVey’s family is also seen as some- thing special. His wives and daughters auto- matically received titles as High Priestesses by virtue of their family relation to him. Again this illustrates how blood is more important than both ideological issues and the meritocracy that the Church of Satan’s “Pentagonal Revision- ism” (see page17) demands. ‡ Anton LaVey plays a key role on another term as well. Religious groups enjoy references to au- thority. Older, well established religions refer to Figure 2. The Church of Satan’s followers are roughly organized in four layers: the core, the soldiers, the in- terested, and the periphery, with an increasing num- ber of followers in each layer. Core Soldiers Interested Periphery Full-fledged religious behavior New Age behavior † The tendency to wholly desert the possibility that the founder is an ordinary person or even a crook is common among followers o f new religious movements. Even if a follower is presented with undeniable evidence somehow the follower does not comprehend the evidence. The thought is beyond their operational paradigm, beyond obscenity and blasphemy; it is unthinkable ."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 9 of 30 their ancient scripture (for example, Moslems refer to the Koran and Christians refer to the Bi- ble), but most new religious groups refer to sci- ence, albeit mostly in the form of pseudo- science such as creation science or faith healing. The Church of Satan cannot refer to science, be- cause most of its original claims of scientific foundation have been rejected by either the Church of Satan itself or modern science, or simply does not apply anymore in the post- 1960es world; the Church of Satan has just An- ton LaVey to lean on as an authority on Satanic religion. Being the single authority they can rely on, it is understandable that they defend him fang and claw. The Church of Satan’s current administration states that the interpretation of its ideology is straightforward: 9. ... Anton LaVey wrote The Satanic Bible , as well as his other works, in such a manner so that they can be directly understood—they are carnal and non-esoteric. No “teacher” is needed, no “guru” must interpret his words for you. [21] This is only true to the extent that the Church of Satan’s administration is exempt from this rule, however, because it takes on the role as inter- preter of the “correct meaning” of Anton LaVey’s writing when it excommunicates fol- lowers for reasons of differing interpretations of Anton LaVey’s writing. One follower received the following statements in his excommunica- tion: I don’t think you’ve ever had much admiration or con- fidence in me personally, and you’ve shown yourself to be increasingly critical of our founder’s ideas, as well. You’ve done your best to stir up dissension and purposely create misapprehensions about who we are and what Satanism advocates, despite attempts to guide, encourage and educate you. [27] These statements demonstrate that criticism of the founder’s ideas is frowned upon, and that the Church of Satan actively attempts to en- force a specific interpretation where “no ‘teach- er’ is needed.” The potential objections that this follower did not understand the ideology or was never appreciated are not valid, because Blanche Barton had written a personalized statement of appreciation for his efforts to the same person just half a year earlier [28]. Hence, only the Church of Satan’s administra- tion can provide a “true” interpretation of An- ton LaVey’s ambiguous writing. Anyone else making doctrinaire statements on the meaning of his texts is branded a heretic (as ironic as it may seem for a religion called Satanism—see Figure 3) who falsifies Satanism and misleads people. 2. There is strong contempt for organizations that follow the teachings of the founder without being followers of the founder’s or- ganization. [25, pp.200-201] ‡ Today, several members of his family have become an embarrassment to the Church of Satan, which now does its best to downtone their influence: Diane Hegarty is never mentioned; Karla LaVey was suddenly never really important to the Church of Satan once s he distanced herself from the organization to start The First Satanic Church; and Zeena LaVey was soon considered a dumb blonde whe n she parted with the Church of Satan, denounced her “unfather,” and joined the Temple of Set. Figure 3. Only the Church of Satan’s core group can provide a “true” interpretation of Anton LaVey’s ambiguous writing. Anyone else making doctrinaire statements on the meaning of his texts is branded a heretic who falsifies Satanism and misleads people."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 10 of 30 It is common to find remarkably strong hostili- ty against the new organization if eventually a group of people creates an organization of their own that follows the teaching of the founder without belonging to the founder’s own organi- zation. The Church of Satan is evidently no exception from the above rules, as described in Section 5, Desire for a Name Patent , and Section 6, Earned Hostility . The Church of Satan officially disap- proves of new organizations: Founding your own “satanic organization” is a detri- ment to our movement. [29] Sociologists have proposed the theory that by portraying the leader as a very special person, the followers feel that they themselves become very special people by proxy [25, p.69]. To each follower, the story told about the leader and the new religious group becomes an intricate story about himself or herself: the followers substitute their perception of their identity with that of their leader in the sense that they merge their own identity with the leader’s fabricated identi- ty. This also happens between the followers and the group’s perceived identity; that is, by be- lieving that the group is superior each follower feels superior—and it does not matter to the fol- lower that reality speaks against him or her. Focus is thus not on the ideology but on the identity one assumes by being part of the group; or rather, on the identity that one as- sumes by being part of the story about the group. In short, they create a modern myth (or have it created for them) then play a part in it. Consequently, if someone uses the leader’s or the group’s ideology outside of the story which is lock-stepped with the leader and the group (as is the case if someone founds a new organi- zation that follows the ideology), the followers feel that they have been personally robbed, be- cause their identity has become interwoven with the fictitious identity of the leader and the group. It is question of joining their story , not a question of joining their ideology. It has every- thing to do with the Church of Satan as an orga- nization and its founder, and nothing to do with its ideology. Supporting the above theory, the Church of Satan strongly emphasizes that Anton LaVey de- fined modern Satanism, placing Anton LaVey as the pivot point rather than the ill-defined ide- ology. For example: Anton LaVey originally defined the roots of Satanism, and we will continue to place our heritage in the con- text he provided. [30] The Church of Satan thus claims one true way- ism based on Anton LaVey , disregarding the ide- ology of spin-off organizations as a goal in itself. Such a behavioral pattern is personality cult be- havior in disguise. With the story of the leader and organization so closely anchored in the followers’ identity feelings, it is quite understandable that their re- action is that of someone that has been person- ally attacked if someone dares to criticize their leader or organization. 3. The religious group prefers to view itself as isolated from people outside of the group. [31, p.34] A religious group often sees itself as “saved” compared to people outside of the group. Its followers feel that the group’s path to success (earthly or otherwise) is the best path for them- selves. Groups may be more or less accepting of other groups, but usually do not acknowledge the routes taken by those groups as leading to the best final destination, wherever that be. The Church of Satan consistently describes it- self as an alien elite. Its followers are thought to constitute a peerless group of human beings whose conviction provides them with unique features above and beyond other human beings. Followers that associate with other Satanic groups tend to be met with distrust in the Church of Satan, as is association with non-Sa- tanic religious groups. There is no demand that its followers isolate themselves among fellow followers, as is customary among extremists groups. The Church of Satan is probably to be found among “moderate” groups in that re- gard, except for interaction with other Satanic organizations: [I]f you choose to affiliate with any pseudo-Satanic or anti-Satanic groups, you may well find yourself disaf- filiated from the Church of Satan. Forewarned is fore- armed. [21] Peter Gilmore summarizes the sentiments of both characteristics 2 and 3 in his refusal to co- operate with leading sociologist James R. Lewis in the field on a “Satanic Sourcebook”: I suspect that this book will be padded-out with a col- lection of writings coming from what I’d call the “pseudo-Satanic fringe,” the usual online rabble who have no real outlet professionally or via websites which have any significant traffic, let alone any coher- ent philosophy."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 11 of 30 As the truism goes, “You are known by the company you keep.” Thus, having our materials “rubbing el- bows” with the scribblings of these people would only give them credence that they do not deserve. [32] 4. The religious group prefers to describe itself as a philosophy that straddles a boundary between psychology and religion, not as a re- ligion. [33, p.35] The term “religion” has connotations that fol- lowers of religious groups often prefer to avoid. These groups typically make no direct use of anthropomorphic gods, which is a hallmark of traditional religions and silently implied by the term “religion.” Instead they see themselves as groups that follow a specific “philosophy” for- mulated by the founder. For example, The Tran- scendental Meditation program describes itself as a technique and spurns the term “religion” (and even went to court to avoid it), but sociolo- gists agree that the organization is a religion [31, p.20]. There are clear distinctions between religions and philosophies, † and the differences in the be- havior of followers of a religion and followers of a philosophy are reasonably well defined among sociologists. Thus, although some reli- gious groups may prefer the term “philoso- phy” to the term “religion” to avoid certain as- sociations, it is the latter that is correct. The Church of Satan does present itself as a re- ligion, but with few exceptions its followers prefer to think of their religion as a philosophy. The official Church of Satan Web page calls it the “iconoclastic philosophy” [34], and Blanche Barton refers to the religion as “Dr. LaVey’s dia- bolical philosophy” [16]. Documents such as The Satanic Bible and the behavior of its followers would nonetheless cat- egorize the Church of Satan as a religion. 5. The group believes to be founded on science rather than faith. [35, pp.72-74; 33, p.34] A related tendency among religious groups is a belief in justification by science rather than faith. The Church of Scientology is an unmistak- able example, as the reference to science is em- bedded in the religion’s very name, but many other groups revolving around UFOs, pyramid healing, astrology, psychokinesis, etc. also claim scientific evidence. Again, they may dislike the term “religion,” because it sets them on an equal foot with traditional religions which ad- mit their faith-based existence. The Church of Satan has similarly claimed va- lidity in science, and in The Cloven Hoof Blanche Barton not only claims connection with science but equates followers of the religion with scien- tists: ... Scientists need that ineffable combination of rigid objectivism and precision in their observations, unsul- lied by expectations or projected hopes, and a dream- er’s mind, capable of imagining methods and drawing conclusions that no one has devised before. They must be able to spend endless hours of boring observations, and then combine those data in new, revelatory combi- nations, and maintain their momentum and passion throughout those long, boring hours. Only the Satanic mind can come up with that rare combination. ... We should stand as the ones who are the most in tol- erant of sloppy science and imprecise thinking, arro- gant in our demands for precision... ‡ [36, p.26] 6. The religious group promotes itself using modern marketing efforts. [33, p.33] Many religious organizations, and especially relatively new organizations, promote them- selves by referring to celebrities that have joined. For example, the Church of Scientology uses celebrities such as John Travolta, Kelly Pre- ston, Kirstie Alley, Isaac Hayes, Lisa Marie Pres- ley, Juliette Lewis, Chick Corea, and many oth- ers to highlight its success [37]. Again, the Church of Satan fits the model, re- ferring to celebrities (albeit of much lesser fame) such as the individuals named in Section 4, Members, Priesthood, and Magistrate . The above traits of new religions fit the core and the soldiers in the higher two layers of the Church of Satan’s organizational structure in Figure 2. The individuals found in the lower two layers are somewhat different. † Among other differences, a religion divides the world into the mundane and the sacred, which a philosophy does not. Recent phi- losophies distance themselves from the metaphysical world often found in religions. In addition, religions make use of rituals, cere- monies, and/or prayers that are absent from philosophies. Religions also imply social bindings that philosophies do not offer. Religion also sets certain standards of conduct that philosophies do not require. The line between religion and philosophy may b e somewhat blurry at times, but it is ultimately the behavior of followers that determine whether they are religious or not, and c onse- quently whether it is a religion or a philosophy. ‡ Apparently this demand for precision does not seem to apply to The Satanic Bible , and the intolerance of sloppy science does not ex- plain why the Church of Satan insists on outdated and rejected scientific theories, such as those of Herbert Spencer and Sigmund Freud. If Satanists are inherently scientists, it is bizarre that not a single scientist ranks among the individuals usually fea tured in the Church of Satan’s self-promotion. At best, the Church of Satan has developed an intellectual beer gut caused by lack of mental t rain- ing, leaning back comfortably in a chair upholstered with ignorance."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 12 of 30 2.2 New Age Style From a sociological perspective the less active followers of the Church of Satan—the interested followers and the periphery—can best be classi- fied as New Age religious people and people with no actual involvement in the religion, re- spectively. New Age religious people are characterized by rather unorganized religious “training” [25, pp.316-317]. Like the religious people men- tioned earlier they typically consider them- selves followers of science-founded philoso- phies, but their relation to the founder and spin- off organizations is usually much more relaxed. The technical term for their form of religious study is “audience cult” † [31, p.207], which means that their understanding of their religion is self-taught via books and perhaps occasional meetings. They are free to pick and choose from various books and sources: a religious buffet. Ideologies vary greatly among New Age reli- gions, but a universal characteristic is that of personal development [31, p.206; 33, p.24-27]. Most of these religions emphasize individual- ism and self-realization where the follower works on himself or herself in some manner to- wards some concept of perfection. Mankind is perceived as a creature with a higher potential, which unfortunately is curbed by today’s cul- tures and traditions. The followers believe that they will be better off if the religion is allowed a place in the sun, where the follower: ... may come forth in splendor proclaiming “ I AM A SATANIST! BOW DOWN, FOR I AM THE HIGHEST EMBODIMENT OF HUMAN LIFE! ” [6, p.45] —Less restrained, perhaps, but otherwise the Church of Satan’s anticipation of human poten- tial is not different from those of other New Age religions in the world-affirming category. The Church of Satan’s use of rituals is typical for New Age religions. The designers of the rit- uals used in New Age religions describe each ritual in relative detail, but make no attempts at explaining how or why the rituals work [25, pp.320-321]. Followers accept the designers as authorities solely based on the designers’ per- sonal testimonials. If a designer says that a ritu- al works, the follower accepts it as fact and does not seek scientific or even theological explana- tions. For example, if a crystal healer states that speaking a particular sentence to a pink stone will improve the follower’s aura, the follower will unquestioningly do it, evidence and expla- nations be damned. Anton LaVey thus provides recipes for rituals in both The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals , but does not humor the reader with explana- tions beyond nebulous hints at bioelectricity, di- rected emotional force, adrenaline, cosmic push/pull effects, tumblers in a combination lock, etc. [6, pp.135, 143; 15, pp.17, 107; 14, p.35]. He does provide an explanation for not explaining, however: It will be said, by some, that these instructions and pro- cedures are nothing more than applied psychology, or scientific fact, called by “magical” terminology—until they arrive at a passage in the text that is “based on no known scientific finding.” It is for this reason that no attempt has been made to limit the explanations set forth to a set nomenclature. [6, p.110] One one account does the Church of Satan’s interested followers distinguish themselves from New Age religions. New Age religions are characterized by their large share of “seeking” people, who drift from one religion to another as they refine their views or gain new insights. The interested followers of the Church of Satan may also drift, but with a peculiar twist: Satan usually remains a common denominator in their religious affiliations when they move from what is essentially one religious group to anoth- er, unless they become “born again” Christians or otherwise leave the New Age milieu entire- ly. The ambiguity of the Church of Satan’s views allows its followers to even radically ad- just their views and still pay homage to the Devil. Instead of moving to another religion, they redefine their own religion to designate their new stance. It is a religious analogy to the warring states in Chinese history: each state might win against the Chinese empire, yet somehow it remained China. Followers may shift stance many times and still refer to themselves as Satanists, and a con- flict does not ensue until they are confronted with discrepant views held by other people al- so believing to be Satanists. It was not until the Internet became available for everyone that such discrepancies became widely evident. Where some New Age religions keep their fol- lowers in the organization via degree systems allowing followers into higher organizational † “Cult” is used here to refer to religious groups of people that are not part of traditional religions, and who often find themse lves in conflict with social norms. It is not used in any negative sense."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 13 of 30 levels with new secrets as their insights in- crease, or simply let the followers go, the Church of Satan thus takes a different route: if a follower revises his or her view, then the new view is Satanism, too. It is only when the fol- lower does not accept other views as Satanic that the Church of Satan administration typical- ly responds with an explanation that the follow- er’s “one true way” attitude is not appreciated. Such enforced dogmalessness ensures that dab- blers will not defect to another religion. The periphery does not travel that far in their quests for insight. These individuals read The Satanic Bible or wear a Baphomet symbol and consider themselves Satanists, but have only very limited insight and interest in their religion and can better be described as “identity Sa- tanists” than philosophical, ideological, or reli- gious Satanists. They are somewhat compara- ble to people wearing “hip hop” pants to dis- play a sense of belonging. 3. Active Recruiting The Church of Satan states that it does not so- licit memberships [1], but material such as Coop’s Church of Satan recruitment poster (Fig- ure 4) is a clear invitation to join. When present- ed with such initiatives by Church of Satan fol- lowers, the Church of Satan typically replies that it is not responsible for the actions of indi- vidual followers. Nevertheless, Coop’s poster has been described by Blanche Barton in the Church of Satan’s official newsletter, The Cloven Hoof as “the new Church of Satan recruiting poster,” [36] evidence that the Church of Satan endorses the follower’s artwork as a recruit- ment initiative. The welcome (“splash”) screen (Figure 5) on the official Church of Satan Web page greets the visitor with the text: We’re looking for a few outstanding individuals... [38] which is again an invitation to join the organiza- tion. Followers are sometimes inspired to join in the form of seemingly personal “form letters” [23]. A typical form letter is sent to the owner of a newly discovered Web page that deals favor- ably with Satanism. The form letter contains praise for a well-designed and informative Web page, followed by a question whether the per- son is a follower of the Church of Satan or in- tends to join it later, requesting a reason if not. Such letters are of course specifically designed to draw the person’s attention towards the Church of Satan with an eye towards affilia- tion. Other people receiving such form letters include those that post Church of Satan friend- ly messages to alt.satanism or various message boards on the Internet. The Grotto Master’s Handbook explains that Grotto Masters receive a discount on grotto fees if they recruit new followers for the organiza- tion: ... you'll receive $10 credit toward your yearly grotto fees for every direct Sponsorship of a new Church of Satan member. [39] This is an obvious incitement to recruit follow- ers for the Church of Satan. The Grotto Master’s Handbook is marked confidential by the Church of Satan. Figure 4. The Church of Sa- tan claims that it does not advocate membership, but the text “Join now!” on this recruitment poster by Coop is a clear-cut invita- tion to join. Explanations such as the Church of Sa- tan not being responsible for individual followers’ actions does not hold in cases like this poster where the Church of Satan openly and actively endorses the poster in, e.g., The Cloven Hoof , the Church of Satan’s official newsletter. Figure 5. The text: “We’re looking for a few outstand- ing individuals...” welcoming visitors to the official Church of Satan Web page somewhat contradicts the organization’s claim that it does not advocate mem- bership."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 14 of 30 4. Members, Priesthood, and Magistrate The official Church of Satan Web page main- tains that: individuals who resonate with Satan have always been an alien elite. [34] This statement does not imply that one must be a member of the Church of Satan to qualify as elite, but it does imply that followers of the Church of Satan automatically belong to an elite, since presumably they must have felt a resonance with Satan in order to join. Hence, the statement suggests that joining the organi- zation is equivalent to being part of an elite. If the above only hints at being a member of an elite by implication of a membership of the Church of Satan, any doubt is cast aside when the new follower receives the confirmation of membership from the Church of Satan, which declares that: You have successfully entered into an alliance with true Satanists, those who lead and innovate ... —you have established an unwavering bond with the rare others like yourself. Here you have found freedom. [40] It also promises if not wealth and riches, at least a potential for it: As a Satanic magician, you will develop your abilities to change things around you, to influence those you wish, and to draw forth the advantages you desire. [40] The individuals forming the elite are de- scribed just as ambiguously as the Church of Sa- tan’s ideology, and are vaguely referred to as those who “lead and innovate.” The Church of Satan Web page refers to itself and its followers as: a cabal of like-minded, highly independent individuals who don’t require a social support group. Such selec- tive folk, the aristocracy of the able, at times partake of the pleasure of finding those few who share their per- sonal interests. [26] Neither specifically state how the “alien elite” is an elite, but only describes them as somehow in charge and in positions as independent de facto leaders. When the Church of Satan gives examples of members of the elite, recurring names include: Sammy Davis, Jr., Jayne Mansfield, Kenneth Anger, Marilyn Manson, Coop, Timothy Patrick Butler, Michael Moynihan, Vincent Crowley, and Boyd Rice. Occasionally the list is extended with a few other people. Few people outside of the Satanic scene know any but the first four people mentioned, and at least two of those four people received their membership in the Church of Satan only as honorary memberships. The remaining list of people have had moderate success in their specific fields, but would hardly qualify as an elite. By joining the Church of Satan one somehow becomes part of the cabal formed by the elite, opaque as the definition may be. But if anyone becomes part of it simply by joining the Church of Satan, statistically the elite is really com- prised of people not particularly different from the new follower. If such logic escapes the new follower, the follower is free to invent any ideal- ized form of elitism and believe that he or she is now part of this made-up elite. “Registered” membership of the Church of Sa- tan is obtained by sending a sum of $100.00 and a signed statement that one wishes to join the organization to the Church of Satan [1]. It is reg- istered members that receive the confirmation of membership referenced above. “Active” membership requires followers to send detailed personal information to the Church of Satan, providing contact information and a photograph, and the answers to a ques- tionnaire with forty personal questions [1]. This form of membership is otherwise free. The Church of Satan does not explain why it requires such detailed personal information in the active membership application, but it is pre- sumably used when followers request contact with consenting followers in their area. The de- tailed information can be used to guarantee that people with diverging interpretations of the Church of Satan’s writings are kept apart. It is usually more productive to gather like-minded individuals than disagreeing individuals, but the separation also minimizes the risk of reveal- ing the ambiguity of the writings. The Church of Satan states that, among other reasons, the in- formation is used to protect its members: The protection of our members is one of the reasons we gather information through our extensive question- naire about the people who affiliate and wish Active Membership participation. [1] The Church of Satan has stated that its follow- ers are acknowledged with titles based on ac- complishments in the “real world”: Members of our Priesthood are people of accomplish- ment in the real world—they have mastered skills and have won peer recognition, which is how they have at- tained their position—“as above, so below.” [1] Some speculation on the nature of these accom- plishments has been made, as the accomplish- ments of some nominees have seemed rather"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 15 of 30 limited. A common trait across all nominations to priesthood or magistrate is that the nominees have influenced other people to join the Church of Satan, that is, their accomplishment is that of contributing to an increased membership count. (Incidentally, the Church of Satan’s self-image as an organization for people capable of real- world accomplishments is far from unique to the Church of Satan—it is common for New Age religions to cater to those very people that are socially well-integrated. [31, p.50]) A distinct group of people have received priesthood or magistrate degrees as honorary ti- tles. Most known among these are perhaps Sammy Davis, Jr., King Diamond, and Marylin Manson. The exact reason for their honorary ti- tles is somewhat unclear. Sammy Davis, Jr. was Jewish; King Diamond’s personal belief that centers around an afterlife and the existence of a human soul seems at odds with the Church of Satan’s fundamental stance even when the am- biguity of its ideology is considered; and Mary- lin Manson’s “outcast” style conflicts with the Church of Satan’s “elite” image—and besides, he later publicly distanced himself from the Church of Satan. These individuals have cer- tainly made accomplishments in the real world by figuratively raising the Devil in their stage shows, and the reason for their honorary titles may be that simple. However, the titles may al- so have been offered as a marketing scheme. By offering a honorary title to a successful person the Church of Satan acquires a marketing agent whose success becomes linked with Satan and the Church of Satan via the title in the organiza- tion. In 1975 Anton LaVey decided to sell titles for a fee, a decision that led Michael Aquino to con- clude that the Church of Satan had deviated from its path. Michael Aquino subsequently formed The Temple of Set to continue what he believed was the original intent of the Church of Satan [2, pp.407 – 412]. The reasoning behind the selling of titles may have been that the abili- ty to afford money on mostly useless titles was an indication of success in the real world, re- flecting the Church of Satan’s current stance on accomplishments as a metric of titular awards. Diane Hegarty’s letter to Michael Aquino indi- cates that this is the case: If a big shot is really a big shot and/or capable of offer- ing the Church a sizable contribution, he has had his fill of fancy dinners, honor guards, and fifteen-word honorary titles. [2, p.827] Intentional or not, the selling of intangibles is al- so a classical example of fleecing people that will pay for a pat on their backs. It is not clear whether anyone has taken the offer, unless the title as Grotto Master qualifies. (A Grotto Mas- ter is required to pay a yearly fee.) 5. Desire for a Name Patent The Church of Satan is the first organization in modern society to claim devotion to Satan; Aleister Crowley’s groups, its only arguable contesters to the title as Satanic organizations, have been linked with occultism per se rather than Satanism specifically, and the various “re- ligious Satanists” in the 1950es were clandestine and short-lived. The novelty granted the Church of Satan an implied patent on the name, and the Church of Satan has historically been rash to dismiss any group making claim to the name as a mere copy of the Church of Satan (see, e.g., the Church of Satan’s Satanic Bunco Sheet [21], which practical- ly defines any Satanic group beyond the Church of Satan as such a copy) that prospective or cur- rent followers should avoid. Although the Church of Satan does state that a person is born a Satanist and that membership of the Church of Satan is not necessary to be a Satanist [41], the Church of Satan does not tend to acknowledge people as Satanists unless they openly support the Church of Satan. In fact, ranking followers in the Church of Satan have habitually declared that only through member- ship of the Church of Satan does a person quali- fy as a “real” Satanist—in the words of a Church of Satan priest: And then there are two types of Satanists; those who are members of the Church Of Satan and those who wish they were. [42] Complaints to their superior in rank are nor- mally defused with the explanation that the ranking follower is entitled to his or her opin- ion, and that one should not otherwise take this follower too seriously. In the case of the afore- mentioned priest, Peter Gilmore explained to one member: He has his own personal style [...]. That has no bearing on you both at all, I simply am aware that this situation exists. [43] It is not clear how many people have been in- timidated by these declarations and felt re- quired to join as a result, but the author has en-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 16 of 30 countered people that have been insecure of their entitlement to the label “Satanist” as non- members of the Church of Satan because of such statements [23]. The Church of Satan aggressively defends its desired position as sole proprietor of Satanism on the Internet. Many organizations and indi- viduals have received intimidating emails with (hollow) lawsuit threats or have been subjected to harassment by Church of Satan followers per instruction from the Church of Satan’s adminis- tration. For example, Peter Gilmore wrote in an email to selected individuals that the adminis- tration would: ... like to see you perhaps interact with one another and coordinate your attacks on those who dare to try to be- smirch our organization [author’s emphasis], and those of us who I think have earned your respect as your leaders. [44] There are also examples that the Church of Sa- tan’s administration has divulged personal membership information about followers who turned on the Church of Satan [44], despite the organization’s claim in the affiliation informa- tion that: an individual’s membership is held in strictest confi- dence by the Church of Satan. [1] Other attempts to keep a monopoly on Satan- ism include the Church of Satan’s use of the Ba- phomet symbol (Figure 6) . Reportedly, the Church of Satan originally used an exact copy of the Baphomet symbol displayed on the front cover of Magic and the Supernatural [45] on mem- bership cards and other material, but has later produced a cleaned-up rendition [46]. The Church of Satan does not own the original sym- bol, but the Church of Satan has attempted to prevent other organizations from using any ren- dition of the symbol claiming it to be a copy- right violation against the Church of Satan [23]. † Because the precise rendition is less important than symbolism when it comes to religious symbols, the Church of Satan’s aggressive trademark protection indicates that there is something else at stake than the use of the reli- gious symbol. The Church of Satan often argues that if not for Anton LaVey, other organizations would never have thought of referring to themselves as Satanic. This argument is questionable, how- ever, because it is based on the improbable premise that no-one else would have designed an organization and called it “Satanism” dur- Figure 6. The Baphomet symbol was copied by the Church of Satan from the front cover of Maurice Bessy’s book, Magic and the Supernatural (left). The current edition of The Satanic Bible uses the same symbol (right), but with several clean-ups compensating for the somewhat blurred rendition on Bessy’s book. Although the precise rendi- tion is less important than symbolism when it comes to religious symbols, the Church of Satan has aggressively pursued other uses of the symbol as copyright violations against the Church of Satan. † In practice, it is the specific use of the Baphomet symbol in combination with the words “Church of Satan” that is protected by a trademark, not the symbol itself. Keeping tradition, the Church of Satan administration seldom pursues copyright “violators” dir ect- ly, but instead encourages followers of the Church of Satan to combat people that are followers of other Satanic organizations, and hence also those that use the symbol outside of the Church of Satan. This enables the administration to deny direct involvement using the plea of not being responsible for the actions of its followers."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 17 of 30 ing the three decades following the creation of Anton LaVey’s organization, especially because the interest in occultism and rebellion against authorities is still strong. The question remains what the Church of Sa- tan is competing for, and why other organiza- tions are seen as threats. The membership count cannot be important, because the membership count is kept secret, and the organization is hardly collecting souls. The best bets seem to be either the desire to be a large organization, hop- ing to eventually gain influence, or money. At a $100.00 registration fee per follower, followers are a profitable business, although far less prof- itable than systemized exploitation of members by means of tutelary charge, for example. Whatever its motives, the Church of Satan fiercely combats any alternatives to its desired monopoly. 6. Earned Hostility Most organizations laying claim to Satan’s name are hostile against the Church of Satan. According to the Satanic Bunco Sheet the Church of Satan views the attacks mostly as “sour- grapes” attacks, meaning that the organizations are envious of something that only the Church of Satan provides [21]. There is probably an ele- ment of truth in the statement, because a larger portion of the groups tend to select names that are very close to the name “The Church of Sa- tan,” indicating their primary source of inspira- tion. We thus find groups emerging named “The First Church of Satan,” “New Church of Satan,” “The Church of Satanic Brotherhood,” “The Original Church of Satan,” etc. Lending further credibility to the Church of Satan’s view the behavior of many new High Priests of vari- ous new and improved Church of Satans (not necessarily including or limited to the organiza- tions mentioned above) seem rather focused on being High Priests and little else. Finally, it is common to observe rebellious behavior against the original organization among break-out sects. It is easy to become a member of the Church of Satan and with the grapes thus within easy reach the Church of Satan’s sour-grapes argu- ment is not air-tight, however. Furthermore, varying versions of the sour-grapes argument tend to be uncritically used against any hostile non-follower, ex-follower, or organization, indi- cating that perhaps this argument provides an explanation that is too simple. There may be other motivations behind some of the attacks against the Church of Satan. Some doubt can be shed over the desire to be a copy of the Church of Satan. Inspiration from The Satanic Bible or several of the many sources that Anton LaVey cited is unescapable seeing that most other sources are Christian theology. Drawing inspiration from Anton LaVey is not equivalent to copying the Church of Satan. Split groups are inevitable, because tradition- ally such groups arise from different interpreta- tions of a religion, or because emphasis is placed on other elements of the religion than in the original organization. The vagueness of the Church of Satan begs for diversion and individ- uals focusing on each their understanding. In any religion, individuals that delve deeper into a case that they feel dedicated to usually desire less breadth in the organization’s conviction than necessary for the sustainment of the origi- nal community. They split off, not because they want to be a copy the original group, but be- cause they want to pursue their own, refined beliefs. The choice of a similar name is therefore not necessarily proof that the new organizations de- sire to copy the Church of Satan or otherwise ride on its coat-tails, as the Church of Satan ar- gues. Instead, the name testifies that the organi- zations wish to be what they thought the Church of Satan should have been or once was. The Church of Satan may misunderstand it as an attack when another organization clarifies its stance on some of the facets also found in the Church of Satan. It is also possible that Church of Satan followers feel that their religion is the “one true way” and that any other voiced opin- ion is a heretical attack. Perusing archived Usenet (newsgroup) messages on the Internet the Church of Satan is quick to scornfully de- merit any competition it receives, and typically with no other provocation than the announce- ment of a new organization that does not men- tion the Church of Satan. When attacked by other organizations the Church of Satan may have had motives to have cast the first stone triggering an aggressive reac- tion from the other organization. Pentagonal Re- visionism states that first of all the Church of Sa- tan desires stratification , meaning that: Water must be allowed to seek its own level without interference from apologists for incompetence. [14]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 18 of 30 It is a form of lassez-faire libertarianism, which on one hand implies that the Church of Satan should welcome competing organiza- tions as vehicles for stratification, and on the other hand should view them as threats. The Church of Satan evidently concentrates on the latter, attempting to level other organizations when natural stratification in the Church of Sa- tan’s favor is not prompt enough. Some of the other organizations are hardly in- nocent, but the Church of Satan evidently at- tempts to quell its competition by means of in- timidation as discussed earlier. Decrees issued by the organization’s very top, such as Syco- phants Unite! by Blanche Barton, demand that: [The Church of Satan’s] supporters and advocates must be prepared to recognize and battle our enemies, especially when they’re wearing black robes. [47] The enemies are defined as any other organi- zation laying claim to Satan’s name. The Church of Satan presumably has a large membership base compared with competing or- ganizations who are encouraged by the Church of Satan to attack first. Even without encourage- ment, for each person that attacks the Church of Satan for no reason statistically the Church of Satan can be expected to have many more fol- lowers that have made similar attacks out of the blue. The encouragement only exacerbates the hostility. It is very plausible that many attacks against the Church of Satan are results of harassment by Church of Satan followers acting on expecta- tions from the Church of Satan’s administrators. The CoS Files contain examples of conflicts that are initiated by the Church of Satan. [44] The competition from alternative Satanic orga- nizations is two-fold: firstly, the alternative or- ganizations threaten the Church of Satan’s re- cruitment as they provide additional options for those that would otherwise have joined the Church of Satan. If one was to believe the Church of Satan’s statement that it does not ad- vocate membership, it would seem unlikely that the Church of Satan would be provoked by a competition for followers. In fact, the Church of Satan often proclaims that it is better off with- out those followers that join other Satanic orga- nizations [48; 23]. As was argued in the previ- ous section, however, the Church of Satan ac- tively recruits followers, and the proclamation instead indicates that the Church of Satan itself is prone to sour-grape attacks over much small- er grapes. Secondly, the alternative organizations threat- en the Church of Satan’s monopoly on Satan- ism. But, this is inevitable, because as argued earlier virtually any view can be derived from the Church of Satan’s material, and as long as it is referred to as “Satanic,” it qualifies per the Church of Satan’s definition. Both the Church of Satan and other organiza- tions using the label “Satanism” have interest at stake, and to believe the Church of Satan’s pre- tence as a completely innocent organization en- during unjust attacks from vile renegades would be preposterous. On the contrary, the Church of Satan encourages its followers to pre- emptively attack other organizations. 7. Double-Talking and Two-Facing When inevitably followers or prospective fol- lowers of the Church of Satan have complained about the opinions of charismatic people in the Church of Satan, the Church of Satan has usual- ly used the eclecticism argument, replying that the religion encompasses a large array of differ- ing opinions which together form a greater whole, and that each follower should choose what makes him or her successful [23]. At the same time, followers and prospective followers that agree with the same charismatic people find that the Church of Satan reinforces their support stating that these people form the core of the Church of Satan’s ideology. It is unlikely that people with widely diverg- ing opinions will want to discuss religious de- tails with each other on a constructive level (they will rather just hiss at each other), and therefore unlikely that they will discover the conflicting support given by the Church of Sa- tan’s officials. If they do discover the conflict nonetheless, it can be resolved with a repetition of the above reference to richness and diversity of the religion. (That is, serving the Church of Satan’s purpose to “confound and confuse till the stars be numbered,” the people are being told that they are both right, and that they only do not have the insight to appreciate this fact yet.) This stratagem enables the Church of Satan to let many different people with opposing views interact with people of their own liking. In turn, these people are given the impression that Sa- tanism is exactly about their particular interpre-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 19 of 30 tation, because their “contact” in the Church of Satan is endorsed by the organization. By claim- ing support, not only does the Church of Satan persuade gullible people to join the organiza- tion believing it to be well suited to their per- sonal ideology; it also places the charismatic people in a role as active recruiters. It is quite possible that from the Church of Sa- tan’s view their role as recruiters may be their only justification and reason for titular reward in the organization, and that their ideological contributions are summarily ignored unless they are useful for luring more followers and their accompanying $100.00 into the organiza- tion. If the esteemed recruiters eventually begin to discourage more people from joining than they encourage to join, their titles may be re- voked or the recruiters may be expelled for du- bious reasons of sudden disagreement with the Church of Satan or its founder. 8. The 1975 “Turning Point” It is possible that the Church of Satan started as a genuine organization dedicated to the Prince of Darkness, but then deviated from its course and focused on perpetuating its pro- fessed alliance with the Devil only as a conduit for fraud. This is the view held by Michael Aquino of the Temple of Set. The fact that the Church of Satan was original- ly a home study group indicates that at the very least it was originally an ideological movement. Michael Aquino describes how the Church of Satan ostensibly later turned its back on Satan, 1975 being the year where the Church of Satan decided to sell priesthood titles at a fee followed by increasing charges for services and Baphom- et medallions; Baphomet medallions previous- ly sold at $20 already with a comparatively high profit of $17 were now sold at $50 a piece [2, p.420]. According to Michael Aquino, the Church of Satan practically ceased to exist as a religious organization by 1975, largely withdrawing from the public scene until the late 1980es when Peter Gilmore entered the scene after double-court- ing the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan. (This double-courting illustrates that Peter Gilmore used two-faced policies from the very beginning of his career in Satanism.) Michael Aquino argues that Anton LaVey had lost inter- est in Satanism and instead attempted to turn the organization into his personal cash cow, and that the organization’s continued activities were a financial scam. Michael Aquino shows evidence that a focus on finances did escalate in the months before 1975, and that 1975 may have presented a some- what drastic escalation. It is also believable that Michael Aquino’s relation of his concord with Anton LaVey on the belief in Satan is correct, judging from Michael Aquino’s otherwise ex- quisite memory and careful use of sources and documentation. The odds of Michael Aquino having a personal agenda that provokes the view mentioned above are low given the addi- tional documentation of Anton LaVey’s accept of, or belief in, the Devil cited earlier. In frustration over the new direction, which Michael Aquino saw as ideological treason, he claims to have performed a personal invocation of Satan in the form of the ancient Egyptian god Set. In The Book of Coming Forth by Night , Micha- el Aquino describes how Set explained that An- ton LaVey’s “infernal mandate” had been re- voked and passed to Michael Aquino as Anton LaVey’s successor: I [Set] raised him [Anton LaVey] to the Will of a Dai- mon, unbounded by the material dimensions. And so I thought to honour him beyond other men. But it may have been this act of mine that ordained his fall. ... Michael Aquino, you are become Magus V° of the Aeon of Set. [49] The Church of Satan has a case against Micha- el Aquino in terms of the postulated 1975 schism. Firstly, the Church of Satan advises that Michael Aquino’s revelation might have been prompted by a strong desire to be a new Anton LaVey or to take over the Church of Satan: This supernatural revelation supposedly gives him the right to supercede the Church of Satan. Doesn’t that sound familiar? [50] Thus noting that the revelation came at an op- portune moment when Michael Aquino found himself torn between loyalty with the Church of Satan and his personal interpretation of its ide- ology, the Church of Satan has a point: Michael Aquino’s revelation and his evaluation of the Church of Satan are to be taken with a grain of salt. Secondly, Michael Aquino’s conclusion as re- gards the Church of Satan’s departure from its ideology by turning its back on the literal Satan has a potential flaw. His statement that the Church of Satan included the belief in a literal Devil is probably correct considering Anton LaVey’s acceptance of a literal belief in Satan. It"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 20 of 30 is more doubtful whether this belief extended throughout the entire Church of Satan as Michael Aquino feels, however The Church of Satan argues that Michael Aquino overestimates his own importance in the Church of Satan, because in his book, The Church of Satan , Michael Aquino gives an im- pression that he played a much more important role in the Church of Satan than is reflected in Burton Wolfe’s hagiography of Anton LaVey, The Devil’s Avenger , [51] which was released pri- or to Michael Aquino’s conflict with, and subse- quent departure from, the Church of Satan in 1975. The book does not mention Michael Aqui- no, but other followers trusted by Anton LaVey are named. The Church of Satan sensibly argues that if Michael Aquino had been as important for the Church of Satan as indicated in his own book, he would have deserved at least a men- tion in Burton Wolfe’s book. Michael Aquino may have represented just one of perhaps several groups that were each given the impression of being important and privy to confided material. It is reasonable to as- sume in that case that Michael Aquino was de- liberately mislead to believe that he was a most important figure in the Church of Satan and that his views formed the foundation of the or- ganization, while other groups were told simi- lar stories about their views. Michael Aquino’s conclusion is thus valid, but accounting for his possibly limited influence the conclusion may apply to just the group that Michael Aquino knew of and possibly some others. Michael Aquino’s conclusion and its constrained application together indicate that if there were a 1975 schism, it applied to just some of the Church of Satan’s followers. Specifically, Michael Aquino’s conclusion would have been the same if: 1. The Church of Satan believed in Satan, but in 1975 it changed its course and became a scam. 2. The Church of Satan had deliberately echoed what each group wanted to hear, and Micha- el Aquino was led to believe that his view was shared with the entire Church of Satan. Signs that had become too clear to ignore caused the scales to fall from his eyes in mid- 1975. The latter seems more likely given that con- flicting interpretations and lies such as Anton LaVey’s and the Church of Satan’s fabricated past were produced prior to 1975 (see Section 9, Unsupported Claims ). Hence, instead of necessar- ily evidencing a change of course by the Church of Satan, Michael Aquino’s book may rather be a report on how one group became disillu- sioned upon realizing that the Church of Satan had other goals than the group had been led to believe. The first of the Church of Satan’s objections against Michael Aquino remains valid, because he received his revelation at a suspiciously op- portune moment. Its other objection is invalid, however, because Michael Aquino did have distinctive impor- tance in the Church of Satan. He was the editor of the Church of Satan’s official newsletter, The Cloven Hoof and held a IV° title (the highest title obtainable) in the Church of Satan [50], and had authored some of the Church of Satan’s rituals, two of which are available in The Satanic Rituals . His having held such positions open specula- tions as to why Michael Aquino was not at all mentioned in Burton Wolfe’s book. The explanation turns out to be simple enough: Burton Wolfe’s book covers the first few years of the Church of Satan, ending with 1970, just half a year after Michael Aquino had joined. Hence, the Church of Satan’s argument that the omission of Michael Aquino from the book owed to his lacking importance at the time when Michael Aquino departed from the Church of Satan is unfounded. It is reasonable to assume that Anton LaVey’s original home study group was honestly dedi- cated to an emerging religion whose backing ideology the group did not perceive as ambigu- ous for the simple reason that they had an un- spoken agreement on the understanding of Sa- tanism. Later, but possibly as early as the foun- dation of the Church of Satan as more than just a home study group, profit became a stronger motivator than occult studies and insight, or the interest faded. In conclusion, it seems that 1975 may have marked a time when Michael Aquino discov- ered a scam, but if the scam was not intentional from the very birth of the Church of Satan, it certainly must have been brewing before 1975. 9. Unsupported Claims Biographies of Anton LaVey make fantastic claims about his past, claiming that Anton LaVey had been employed as a lion tamer in"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 21 of 30 Clyde Batty’s circus, played in the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra, that he played the Devil in Ro- man Polanski’s film Rosemary’s Baby , that his grandmother was a gypsy who passed on to him legends of vampires and werewolves in her native Transylvania, etc. [3; 51]. In 1998 Zeena Schreck (Anton LaVey’s second daughter) and Nikolas Schreck compiled Anton LaVey: Legend and Reality [52], a list of refuta- tions of many of the fantastic claims that Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan had made about him and his life. The document includes a num- ber of remarks that may be debatable. For exam- ple, it relies in part on statements by Diane He- garty, Anton LaVey’s second wife, including testimonials that she had made during their di- vorce case. It is common for divorcing couples to accuse each other of mistreatment, and in- deed such allegations arose during the divorce between Anton LaVey and Diane Hegarty, too. Her accusations of violence against her commit- ted by Anton LaVey are a clear sign that the di- vorce was problematic but they are not neces- sarily true. Most of the remaining statements in Zeena and Nikolas Schreck’s compilation, however, are highly plausible and do not rely on state- ments by opinionated sources. For example, Anton LaVey asserted that he joined the Clyde Beatty circus in 1947 as a lion tamer [3]. If com- mon sense alone does not speak against the em- ployment of a 17 year old new hire as a lion tamer, the absence of the name “LaVey” or “Levey” from Clyde Beatty’s employment records strongly indicates that Anton LaVey fabricated the story. Similarly, with few excep- tions that provide no statistical weight, Anton LaVey has taken credit for curses involving the death or harm of his enemies only after the al- leged maledictions had taken effect. Like his professed circus employment and curses, most of his history is either unsupported, posthu- mously claimed, or contradicted by facts. It is clear that Zeena and Nikolas Shreck’s mo- tivation for making public the myths behind Anton LaVey in itself does not provide a case against the accuracy of the information. The lack of adequate refutation of the document by the Church of Satan or anyone else is telling. Considering the amount of attention that the Church of Satan has given the few verifiably true events in Anton LaVey’s, combined with the apparent need to fabricate stories it is re- markable how comparatively few noteworthy events must have taken place in his life and in the history of the Church of Satan. † One would expect any other memorable events to have re- ceived similar attention. Not surprisingly did the Church of Satan not approve of Anton LaVey: Legend and Reality . Faced with undeniable evidence against Anton LaVey’s claims, the Church of Satan instead de- fended its founder with the argument that the details of his life are less important than the fact that he founded the Church of Satan. Apparent- ly the Church of Satan does not consider this ar- gument when it attacks leaders of other Satanic organizations, because the Church of Satan is quick to track down and point out inconsisten- cies and potential fallacies in claims made by competing leaders [53, 54]. Unless the Church of Satan is a personality cult or otherwise revolves around the life of its founder, the Church of Satan’s appeal to irrele- vance is correct. The Church of Satan even turns the argument around, claiming that it is those who mention that Anton LaVey fabricated his past that have personality cult mentality—in the words of Michael Rose (Magister): Another common avenue of attack is to charge that members of the Church of Satan worshipped Dr. LaVey. These dolts cannot distinguish worship from respect. ... They imagine that by criticizing Dr. LaVey they can diminish, or cause us to reject, the Church of Satan. They do not attack the philosophy; they attack the philosopher. This makes it quite clear that it is they who are the personality cultists. [55] While it is true that an attack on the founder does not necessarily imply an attack on the ide- ology, it is false to state that the attack implies personality cult mentality on behalf of the at- tacker. The argument may apply to some peo- ple, but does not address the following cases, for example: † If anything, Anton LaVey seems to have been rather unsuccessful. He apparently never held a long term employment, and living off his only success (the creation of the Church of Satan) did not help him from dying broke in a cold and run-down house. He must h ave been bitterly aware of this fact unless his sense of reality was severely distorted. In The Satanic Bible Anton LaVey states that man: “ is worshipping by proxy the man that invented god [original emphasis]” [6, p.44]. If LaVey knew that he was a failure, one may speculate whether his motive behind the Church of Satan was a desire to be worshipped by proxy for a god that he invented. As explained in Section 2, A New Religion , in that respect he succeeded."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 22 of 30 • The leader’s false past and less than glorious demise is criticized with no ulterior motives, with motives of devotion to facts, etc. • The leader is criticized because it will affect those Church of Satan followers whose pri- mary devotion is Anton LaVey. It is under- standable why Church of Satan followers are perceived as people with personality cult mentality when, for example, Peter Gilmore solemnly states that: Dr. LaVey is our High Priest, because he is certainly the most advanced person in the Church of Satan. He is truly a brilliant man and one that we can all learn from. Actually, he never ceases to amaze me with, er, the wondrous things that he’s experienced and has to teach. [56] • When a Church of Satan follower reveres Anton LaVey as the foremost Satanist and at the same time considers his ideology to be a recipe for success, pointing out that Anton LaVey died bitter and broke in a run-down house serves to illustrate that the follower is wrong on at least one account. Hence, it is less than clear, and maybe even unlikely, that those who criticize Anton LaVey would be “personality cultists.” It is a twist of irony that cult mentality is defined as the pro- fession of great devotion to some person and the desire to follow that person almost without questions, when Michael Rose continues: I’ve never believed any of the tired accusations that these people have made ... Dr. LaVey blazed a trail. We who followed him be- cause we were traveling the same way will continue undeterred. [55] It remains that if Anton LaVey’s life were as ir- relevant as Church of Satan officials claim, it is remarkable that he would fabricate such fantas- tic stories, even if he did so out of personal vani- ty, or perhaps because had convinced his origi- nal home study group of an unusual past and was forced to keep up the appearance. Evident- ly the Church of Satan wants to draw from the mystery of a very special person, or the Church of Satan would have ceased to emphasize his “remarkable” life. It is noteworthy that the Church of Satan membership card shown in Figure 1 displays the text “Anton Szandor LaVey / Founder and High Priest,” because it is very unusual for a membership card to display another person’s name unless it is a fan club membership card. Although the Church of Sa- tan’s appeal to irrelevance is valid, clearly it does not reflect the Church of Satan’s use of An- ton LaVey’s sinister image. Lies provide a clue to one’s values, because a storyteller lies about that which he finds impor- tant, and the particular claims themselves are thus telltale of the Church of Satan’s values. It is therefore not surprising, based on the stories about Anton LaVey’s life, that the Church of Sa- tan invariably appreciates people involved in showbiz or “shock” art, sexual fetichism, and various forms of con artistry. (The “News” sec- tion on the official Church of Satan Web page [38] has strong emphasis on such engagements, for example.) One never hears about a Church of Satan follower accentuated by the Church of Satan as a lawyer, programmer, professor, etc. 10. The Barnum Effect The famous circus showman P.T. Barnum’s formula for success was: “Always have a little something for everybody.” The so-called “Bar- num Effect,” named after P.T. Barnum and his methods, takes advantage of the fact that when a person is confronted with an analysis or de- scription where many views are presented and both sides of each view are presented, the per- son perceives an apparent accuracy. It is an illu- sion based on the fallacy of positive instances, in which a person remembers the instances that confirm his or her expectations and forgets the rest [57]. Like palm readings, fortune tellings, horo- scopes, and other products of pseudo-psycholo- gy, a religion that is stated in such general terms that it can hardly miss will always contain “a lit- tle something for everybody.” Essays by Anton LaVey in, e.g., The Devil’s Notebook and Satan Speaks! and his general ad- miration of con artists including P.T. Barnum indicate that Anton LaVey was keenly aware of the methods employed by people making a liv- ing off the money they could trick from unsus- pecting victims. The Satanic Witch [58], also by Anton LaVey, and its extensive reference is a veritable cornucopia of useful techniques to be- guile unwary people into following one’s wish- es. The double-talking and two-facing of the Church of Satan’s current administration pro- vides followers and prospective followers with just what they want to hear, hiding the many opposing views, which are told only to other people that want to hear those views. In the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 23 of 30 world of con artists, this is a form of cold read- ing, except that the Church of Satan raises the temperature to both warm and hot readings, drawing on a priori knowledge about those that it addresses and tailoring the replies according- ly. Intentional or not, the ambiguous texts of the Church of Satan fit the traditional structure of statements characterized by the Barnum Effect, and the Church of Satan’s selective answers are those of the crystal ball gazer. Anton LaVey’s many references to other estab- lished religions as hoaxes may have been fully deserved, but they also drew attention from the possibility that his own ideology might be no better, much like a pickpocket may attempt to create a commotion that allows him to work un- disturbed. The references appeal to those that know they were fooled by the Christian reli- gion; their emotional reaction against their childhood religion is likely to compel them to believe Anton LaVey when he sells his ideolo- gy as the “real thing” that they missed earlier. 11. A Financial Scam? A scam is loosely defined as promising and charging for delivery without delivering. Michael Aquino argues that the Church of Sa- tan is a scam, because it deviated from the Dev- il’s path for financial gains while still claiming to pay homage to Satan (see page19). There is reason to believe that the Church of Satan knowingly attempts to fleece its members, and that some profit was planned from the very establishment of the Church of Satan. In an in- terview with Michael Aquino, professional pub- licist Edward Webber recalls suggesting to An- ton LaVey that LaVey: would never make any money by lecturing on Friday nights for donations [...] it would be better to form some sort of church and get a charter from the State of California [...] I told Anton at the time that the press was going to flip out over all this and that we would get a lot of notoriety. [2, p.27] Reviewer Jerry Carroll of The San Francisco Chronicle interviewed Anton LaVey over dinner one night in 1986, and reported: It was all an act for a marketing niche. “It’s a living,” as he put it. He didn’t hide his contempt for his followers [2, p.431] Occasionally opponents of the Church of Sa- tan have insinuated that the $100.00 member- ship fee is a scam. The Church of Satan has typi- cally replied that Anton LaVey could have cho- sen a more profitable scheme. This reply does not invalidate the accusation, however, because it only states that Anton LaVey was not focused on excessive income or that he made a poor choice. Another recurring reply to the accusation is that Church of Satan followers knew that the money went to Anton LaVey himself. This ar- gument is valid, but followers pay the $100.00 in appreciation of Anton LaVey’s creation of an organization that allegedly suits their ideology. But this is the scam : the organization does not match their personal ideology any more than Leo horoscopes fit Scorpio persons (which they do only because of the Barnum Effect). The Church of Satan’s reply is thus identical to stat- ing that the Church of Satan is not a scam sim- ply because the deceived people were con- vinced! However, although the replies from the Church of Satan do not reject the accusation, and although the yearly Grotto Master fees and the $100.00 registration fee that the Church of Satan receives for each membership do provide a continuous flow of money, there is ample room for improving this flow. The Church of Satan fits the pattern of any other religious group, and if money were its primary business the Church of Satan would probably employ several of the common financial engines of oth- er religions. The limited financial scam-like profiting may therefore be a perk for the religion’s leaders, but it is hardly their primary concern. More seriously, Michael Aquino has noted that Anton LaVey filed for bankruptcy as a re- sult of his and Diane Hegarty’s divorce. The bankruptcy was eventually completed after lengthy trials, and included the liquidation of the Church of Satan [2, pp.427–429]. Hence, the Church of Satan cannot demand payment from anyone, because there is no organization to receive the payment. Only it name exists as a group description, somewhat like the term “Christianity” can exist without a living Christ. Church of Satan officials and members argue that evidently the Church of Satan exists, be- cause the members are right there to argue its existence. This is a valid argument, but it ad- dresses a quite different issue. The argument proves that followers exist that embrace the Sa- tanic ideology (ambiguous as it may be), but it provides no proof that the Church of Satan ex-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 24 of 30 ists as a legal organization that can demand payments. It should perhaps be kept in mind that the Church of Satan is far from alone in financial speculations, which appear to be the rule rather than the exception among religious groups. † The Church of Satan is perhaps one of the lesser players as far as financial scam is considered. It would therefore be incorrect to conclude that money forms the Church of Satan’s motivation for existence, simply because the organization does not pursue financial gains that aggressive- ly. But, it would be equally incorrect to state that the Church of Satan has no interest in scam- like financial activity. 12. An Ideological Scam? It was argued in Section 2, A New Religion , that the Church of Satan provides a religion that is so vaguely defined that virtually any interpreta- tion is readily possible. Such a wide appeal en- ables the religion to gain a large number of members without explicitly supporting any of them. Many of the Church of Satan’s followers seem to revere Anton LaVey as exceptionally intelli- gent, and his oratory skills and literacy can hardly be denied. At first glance it may none- theless seem too flattering to Anton LaVey’s in- telligence to accredit him with the ability to mastermind a hoax that has gone unnoticed for almost forty years. Anton LaVey’s intelligence was probably well above average, and he was certainly not naïve but possessed a certain cunning and an instinc- tive ability to be in the right place at the right time. This is a character trait that fits most suc- cessful con artists. Beyond Anton LaVey’s skill as a con artist— and certainly his desire to be one—it may have been a question of luck. Just like The Satanic Bi- ble was pieced together facing an imminent deadline, the Church of Satan may have been established in a hurry with few thoughts to- wards a consistent ideology. The original Mag- ic Circle almost certainly shared an implied ide- ology, some of which was captured in The Sa- tanic Bible , some not. Once the Church of Satan had been established followers would ap- proach it with each their own understanding, often incompatible with those of other follow- ers, of the ideology expressed by the Church of Satan and The Satanic Bible . Given evidence in both directions, it seems fair to conclude that Anton LaVey did not plan the Church of Satan, and much less an ideological scam. Instead, Anton LaVey accidentally be- came involved in publishing and news events beyond his control, and being a con artist at heart he saw an unused opportunity that he half chose, half was forced to exploit. 13. Inconsistency Gone Unnoticed It may seem surprising at first that the ambi- guity of the Church of Satan’s ideology has gone unnoticed for decades. However, it is like- ly that faced with clear examples of ambiguity, followers will just ignore them. When it comes to religion, rational arguments against the reli- gion tend to fall on the followers’ deaf ears if only the followers feel that the religion suits their best interests. In such situations it is hu- man to err, and apparently even more human to stay in error. This section provides a number of possible ex- planations why followers may ignore rampant examples that they were fooled, and why the in- consistency and perhaps deliberate hoax is not acknowledged. 13.1 Followers of the Church of Satan As is also discussed in Section 2, A New Reli- gion , a follower may not acknowledge the ambi- guity and instead consider his or her own inter- pretation to be the only interpretation possible. The dynamics discussed in Section 2 that cause followers to isolate themselves from other influ- ences also act as a barrier against criticism. (Outside influence is a form of implied criti- cism, as it provides examples of alternative in- terpretations.) A person is less inclined to accepting a state- ment telling the person that he or she is wrong than a statement that confirms the person’s be- lief [59]. Because religious questions or person- al values are typically held without supporting evidence (as opposed to a rational stance), evi- dence pointing in another direction has an even lesser effect on the person if it is religion or val- † Most religions are speculative in that they make hypotheses that invariably fail the falsification principle. By definition, the y are usually scams because they fail to deliver what they promise. They do, however, deliver other products such as social networks, emo- tional gratification, comfortable illusions, etc., meaning that their followers do get something that they pay for—just not what was promised."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 25 of 30 ues that are questioned. The very key princi- ples behind critical thinking, which is required to acknowledge the fundamental flaws in the Church of Satan’s ideology, are antithetical to religious sentiments or personal values. A per- son that voices critique can be expected to be dismissed as either ignorant or a “shit-disturb- er,” a common term against critics within the organization. Sometimes in moments of self-re- flection followers may acknowledge that they “have not yet understood” an apparent contra- diction. Followers whose primary interest in the Church of Satan is a fascination with its founder may be impervious to critique for other reasons than religious conviction or personal values. Such followers display cult mentality, and be- cause the ideology has little importance to such people, a devastating critique of the ideology would produce no effect. Many followers may also feel that they re- ceived something genuine from the Church of Satan, even if the goods are intangible. Their $100.00, their time, and their efforts went to An- ton LaVey or The Church of Satan as a gift in re- turn for what they happened to gain emotional- ly from The Satanic Bible . Such followers create an illusion of accomplishment, leading them to feel that they did receive what they bargained for by this specific religion, when they might as easily have received the same emotional gratifi- cation elsewhere. The illusion of being part of a group that shares one’s ideology is adequate to some, whereas others feel their egos inflated by their membership. If they can display genuine accomplishment in the real world, they attribute it to their membership of the Church of Satan which is most likely inconsequential to their ac- complishments. If their accomplishments are faltering in the real world, usually they can boast of a mediocre achievement as a significant accomplishment instead. † Finally, contributing to one’s local church is considered common practice in the USA, where the Church of Satan appears to recruit most of its followers. This tradition lessens the suspi- cion that perhaps the contributor was cheated, because the contributors are usually not accus- tomed to receiving anything in return but the satisfaction of recognition for the donation. A critique of the Church of Satan and/or its ideology is thus not likely to produce any reso- nance among the Church of Satan’s followers. 13.2 Non-Affiliates of the Church of Satan Outside of the Church of Satan there may also be limited interest in such a critique. One possi- ble explanation is the fact that few people would have reason to accuse Anton LaVey of a poorly designed ideology. Disgruntled ex-fol- lowers would not happily admit that they be- lieved in something that made little sense, and if only a few ex-followers complain or if they complain about virtually anything related to the Church of Satan, they are not taken seriously; sociologists would not consider it unusual com- pared to other ideologies and therefore not par- ticularly worthy of mention; and his sworn reli- gious enemies, fundamentalist Christians, ac- cused him of anything with little concern for truth, burying minor offenses among more seri- ous and easily refuted accusations. The Church of Satan helps downtone the criti- cism. Disgruntled ex-followers that do object to the Church of Satan’s methods are usually ex- plained away by the Church of Satan as people who were never really important in the organi- zation, and who fell by the wayside because they did not have the high standards (implied: the high standards that followers stand to lose by defecting) required to be Satanists. The argu- ment seems thin, however, because these peo- ple include individuals that have been more successful on the Satanic scene than most other Satanists, and individuals that were invited in- to the Magistrate; even Zeena LaVey and Karla LaVey, Anton LaVey’s daughters, who were en- titled High Priestesses of the Church of Satan, were dismissed as insignificant when they eventually defected. If all these people had been that insignificant, they would hardly have achieved their high ranks. Those that receive the Church of Satan’s explanation may not be aware of such facts, however. But perhaps an even more likely explanation is that of lazy convenience. People tend to judge a person and his achievements by the person’s reputation, and drawing on the emotional pow- er of the word “Satan” and the flamboyant, dia- bolical scenery Anton LaVey became a conve- † Among Satanists, the Internet displays a large number of owners of poorly designed web pages that promote themselves as Web art- ists; writers of an article or two that promote themselves as authors; guitar players that cannot play for a living who promote them- selves as musicians, etc."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 26 of 30 nient identification of the embodiment of Satan. If, for example, a person is called “mediocre,” that is what the person becomes for reportorial purposes, and Anton LaVey may have sensed the need to firmly establish himself as an un- usual character even if it meant a radical alter- ation of his past. 13.3 Summary The persistency of the religion in spite of its in- herent contradictions and the many warning beacons can be explained by the commitment and consistency trap, which is well known among marketing experts. It exploits the human tendency to stay consistent with—and even de- fend—one’s decisions, even if the decisions are shown to be wrong. Once a person finds “a little something” in The Satanic Bible or other of the Church of Satan’s publications and subsequent- ly joins the organization, the person has com- mitted himself or herself to the organization, and will be disinclined to deviating from future consistency with this commitment. Ergo, the ideology is kept alive partly by fol- lowers that were deceived, because they act as agents rejecting accusations of an inconsistent ideology using arguments that, lacking tangible evidence, are essentially religious. Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan are handy metaphors for the Devil for both friends and enemies, and if a journalist or follower of the Church of Satan was to finally admit the truth about Anton LaVey’s organization the journalist or follower would necessarily admit that he missed it all the times before. There is a strong tendency to avoid this, and if it means that as a follower of the Church of Satan one ad- mits to paying a $100.00 penalty of being duped by a con man, one might be even less happy about it. Besides, it is unlikely that the person would even be heard among the larger group of people that had not made the discovery, be- cause such a discovery, after all, will hardly be a topic for the next episode of 60 Minutes . 14. Disclosing the Inconsistencies The Internet boom in the mid-1990es enabled followers of the Church of Satan knowing no other followers in their area to communicate with other followers at the speed of email or via instant messaging in IRC chat rooms † . In addi- tion, the Internet relies on written and hence documentable information. This level of com- munication between prospective followers and current Church of Satan followers must have boosted the organization’s membership count, but it also made it possible to quickly see so rampant differences between religious convic- tions that they could not possibly fit under one umbrella religion. In particular, the Internet en- abled followers to compare statements from the Church of Satan administration, revealing “form mails,” more or less veiled threats, and a pattern of saying what people want to hear. The CoS Files [44] contain numerous examples of the Church of Satan’s interaction with followers and competing organizations. The Internet provides the Church of Satan with a recruitment agent, but it is also a tool for unraveling the Church of Satan’s methods that was not widely available during the first three decades of the organization’s existence. The lacking interaction between Church of Satan fol- lowers until the Internet boom probably ex- plains part of the reason why the scam has re- mained mostly hidden. It is perhaps telling that the Church of Satan recognized the Internet’s contribution to grow- ing tension between followers with conflicting ideologies each believing theirs to be Satanic be- cause all ideologies fit the vague definition in The Satanic Bible , and issued several recommen- dations on the Internet and in The Black Flame [47] to either stay off the Internet or not debate with those people that one disagrees with. The Church of Satan’s reconciliation today is pro- vided on its Web page: [S]ince only a very small percentage of our members choose to interact with people online, it would be an error to think that your online experience is necessarily a reflection upon what your personal experience with the Church of Satan might be. [38] Apparently the author of this disclaimer ex- pects the unfortunate follower to believe that he or she happened to meet just the people that disagree, and that there are plenty of followers that agree lurking in the dark world off-line. 15. Conclusion The Church of Satan’s ideology appeals to such a wide range of people that the only obsta- cle to agreeing with it is a potential unwilling- † Instant messaging is an Internet service that enables people to communicate in writing in real time.

The wide application of the religion is explained by the fact that its ideology is inordinately ambiguous, fitting just about every conceivable view. The Satanic Bible and other Church of Satan docu- ments represent so many opposing views that readers are prone to committing the fallacy of positive instances, causing them to focus on statements that match their opinions and forget the rest: it is known as the Barnum Effect, which is utilized by fortune tellers, charlatans, and other quackery. Part of the religion suits people who feel lack- ing in some way, drawing from racist, fascist and Nazi imagery. Ideological scams thrive on such people, who are inclined to accept intangi- ble compensation for their tangible shortcom- ings. Titles admitting followers into the priesthood or magistrate are given in reward to those that persuade new followers to join. Despite its claims the Church of Satan actively recruits followers, and together with a very ag- gressive defense of its historical name patent is very hostile against other organizations. Fol- lowers are expected to antagonize other organi- zations by direct request from the highest-posi- tioned people in the Church of Satan, including Blanche Barton and Peter Gilmore. This behav- ior has earned the Church of Satan a significant level of hostility from other organizations. The Church of Satan maintains that other organiza- tions attack the Church of Satan out of envy, but although this may the case in many situations, it is not a catch-all excuse. There are examples that attacks were initiated by the Church of Sa- tan in the form of intimidation and harassment, and that counterattacks on the Church of Satan were motivated by several stones first cast by the Church of Satan. Anton LaVey’s alternate past is irrelevant for any ideology and must have served a purpose that a professed ideology alone could not satis- fy. It appeals to a fan club or personality cult mentality, which is a strong motivation to join for many people. Several of the indications that the Church of Satan deliberately deceives its members can of course be explained otherwise. For example, the detailed information required for active mem- bership might be genuinely used to match fol- lowers in groups with optimal productivity. In addition, the Church of Satan’s membership exhibits typical religious behavior. It may there- fore be incorrect to conclude that the Church of Satan necessarily has ulterior motives such as monetary or other reasons. It is more likely that the followers of LaVey are not different from other people in the New Age climate, such as a scientologist or a Sai Baba follower, considering that their behavior snugly fits the pattern of those people. Finally, Anton LaVey’s original home study group evidences that there was, at least in the beginning, genuine interest, and that the ambi- guity of their ideology compiled in The Satanic Bible was an accidental result of either implied agreement, sloppiness, or a too aggressive deadline. Yet, LaVey’s fascination with con artists and familiarity with their methods should be con- sidered, especially because the fabrication of a fantastic past is completely unnecessary for an ideology and useful only for religions and per- sonality cults, and for duping unsuspecting vic- tims. The two-faced policies of the Church of Satan and its very hostile stance towards orga- nizations competing for followers seem out of place for an organization claiming to desire peo- ple with high clarity only. Belief or disbelief in Satan, although a rather fundamental issue for the religion, has been claimed alternately, the answer determined by who was asking. Active recruitment is denied but encouraged and prac- tised nonetheless. The ambiguity of the Church of Satan’s religion today (mostly in the form of encouraging personal eclecticism) and the two- faced policies employed by the Church of Satan seem deliberate. There is ample evidence that the Church of Sa- tan has a very strong interest in gaining follow- ers uncritically of their ideological dispositions, and that it actively prevents other groups from gaining any. At a high membership fee of $100.00 memberships may not be an exception- ally profitable business, but it is money none- theless. These facts suggest that the Church of Satan’s interest in followers is in part based on an interest in profit. This speculation is under- scored by Michael Aquino’s documentation, which indicates that Anton LaVey lost interest in the Church of Satan and attempted turned it into a cash cow instead. This all leaves little doubt that the Church of Satan deliberately attempts to fleece gullible"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Emperor’s New Religion Copyright © 2002 Ole Wolf Page 28 of 30 victims. If not intentional from the very begin- ning, certainly this is what the Church of Satan eventually became. The current administration of the Church of Satan clearly uses two-faced policies and double-talking, and encourages hostility against other Satanic organizations. The reason that the Church of Satan’s opera- tion and inconsistent ideology have gone unno- ticed can be explained by psychological effects that cause people to be consistent with earlier errors, even when proven wrong. In addition, followers of different opinions seem to have been kept from each other. This is supported by observing that while Michael Aquino’s group considers 1975 a turning point in the history of the Church of Satan, apparently many other groups did not notice any change. It was not until followers began to communicate in writ- ing via the Internet that the many conflicting statements by the Church of Satan became very clear. It is inconsequential whether the Church of Sa- tan’s methods morally objectionable. It is also inconsequential that the Church of Satan’s reli- gion is inconsistent and tends towards hypocri- sy, because from a sociological point of view such incongruences do not disqualify an ideolo- gy or a religion if they are accidental or results of intellectual shortcomings. The noteworthy conclusion is that the Church of Satan today in- tentionally provides a rubbery religion and claims to be the foundation of nearly any ideol- ogy that (paying) followers happen to agree with. The Church of Satan is yet a young organiza- tion that has had very limited time to formulate an ideology. It is an unfinished product, which will either evolve (for example, via breakaway factions) or die. It is perhaps ironic that the many organizations that have broken off from the Church of Satan to practise their particular understanding of The Satanic Bible and other documents may be the very ones that, in con- trast to the Church of Satan, have genuine ideol- ogies to offer: ideologies that do not embody opposing interpretations with the intent to de- ceive the followers. 16. Acknowledgments I would like to thank Amina Olander Lap for her careful reviews and her clarifications on the dynamics of religious behavior. I would also like to thank Michael Aquino and the reviewers of this article for their corrections and sugges- tions. 17. Revision History The following revisions have been made since this article was first issued: • Section 1.4, Lacking Rituals : there was in fact no funeral ceremony or ritual available; the “celebration of death” ritual originally re- ferred to was not intended for funerals. • Section 8, The 1975 “Turning Point” : Burton Wolfe’s book ends with a description of the Church of Satan in 1970, providing a simple explanation why Michael Aquino was not mentioned in the book. 18.
