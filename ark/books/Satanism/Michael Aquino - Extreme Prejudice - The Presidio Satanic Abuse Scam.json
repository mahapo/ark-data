They were exciting tojoin orvisit; their rituals and ceremonies could be counted upon to be spooky,spectacular,scary, and slapstick. A local Satanist, or better yet Priest or Priestess of theChurch, wasa guaranteed draw for any kind of lecture, seminar, media talk show, orHalloweenparty.Even conventional churches, which one would think would be horrified at such asinister competitor in their midst, often found themselves enjoying the noveltyin spiteof themselves. After all, it gave them something tangible to righteouslydenounce. It gotthem into show biz too, because local television and radio stations quicklyfigured outthat the best debate opponent for a professional Satanist was a professionalChristian.And Hollywood happily fanned the flames. From Rosemary’s Baby in 1966 to TheExorcist in 1974, showdowns between the Devil and God were big box-office.When the Temple of Set was founded in 1975, indeed, those of us who had resignedfrom the Church of Satan to create this new institution felt that it was time tocalmdown a little. The Church had remained such a darling of the media thatSatanistsfound their time taken up largely by public relations events. There just wasn’ttime forserious Black Magic, which, after all, was what becoming a Satanist was supposedto beall about.Furthermore the Temple of Set was finally facing head-on what its predecessorhadbeen tap-dancing around for the previous decade: that there was a serious,sophisticated, and potentially very illuminating foundation for this “religionofotherness”. In this the Temple also benefitted from divesting itself completelyofJudæo-Christian mythology, ideology, and symbolism. We harked back instead topre-J/C ancient Egypt, and an interpretation of its metaphysics that promised toopen adoor to the divinity of each initiated individual. 2And so it was for the Temple’s first decade as well - with one difference: thatwedetermined from the outSet that our attention would always be devoted to our ownmembership’s benefit. We were not there to entertain, fascinate, or stimulatethe publicany more. So modest and private was the Temple of Set, indeed, that the outsideworld1 The Church of Satan is available through Amazon.com in both printed and Kindleebook editions.2 The Temple of Set is available through Amazon.com in both printed and Kindleebook editions.- 8 -scarcely knew we were there at all. That was just fine with Setians as wesettled down toexplore the great mysteries of philosophy, magic, and metaphysics.And we expected it would continue pleasantly on that way forever. None of us,myself included, ever anticipated the nightmare that awaited not justSatanists/Setians,but indeed the entire “occult subculture” - and many who weren’t actually partof it atall - in the 1980s.It began in 1977 when a man named Lawrence Pazder published a book entitledMichelle Remembers. In this book he alleged that his wife Michelle had as aninfantbeen kidnapped and sexually abused by Satanists, then had “repressed” allmemories ofthe experience until he elicited them from her as an adult through “therapysessions”.I remember that when we first heard of it, we all laughed it off as ludicrous,andcertainly too transparently so for anyone to take seriously. It was soon to befound on“remaindered” sale tables, from one of which I picked up my own copy.But away from our amused and contemptuous dismissal, it happened that manyother eyes were reading the book and taking it very seriously indeed. Or, moremalevolently, seeing in it a new technique for acquiring power, fame, and moneybyimitating its theme.Michelle Remembers was ultimately exposed as a fraud [see Appendix #1], but bythen its damage had been done, and that damage proved to be horrific andincalculable,destroying lives, families, and societies throughout many countries.The ominous consequences of Michelle Remembers first came to widespread publicattention in 1983, when a mentally-ill woman named Judy Johnson, on the sole“evidence” of her son’s irritated anus, made an accusation of “Satanic child-molestation” against the McMartin Preschool in Los Angeles. Although the child’sdoctor and father saw nothing unusual about the irritation, and although Johnsonwaslater diagnosed as an acute paranoid schizophreniac, the damage was done and theMcMartin witch-hunt was ignited. It was to end in court seven years later withnofinding of any abuse by anyone at the day-care center.The nationwide drama and sensationalism associated with Michelle Remembers andthe McMartin case ignited an epidemic of “day-care Satanic sex abuse”witch-huntsacross the United States. While many persons were prosecuted and convicted ofsex-abuse as a consequence, not one instance of “Satanism” in connection with eitherchildabuse or day-care center activity was ever demonstrated.By the 1990s law-enforcement and governmental agencies generally, which hadoriginally been caught by complete surprise concerning this bizarre fad, hadfinally hadtime to research it definitively. “Satanic ritual child abuse”:• does not exist in the United States, as reported by the FBI’s National Centerfor the Analysis of Violent Crime in 1992, after an 11-year study. “There aremany children in the United States who, starting early in their lives, areseverely psychologically, physically, and sexually traumatized by angry,sadistic parents or other adults. Such abuse, however, is not perpetrated onlyor primarily by satanists. The statistical odds are that such abusers are- 9 -members of mainstream religions ... For the last eight years American lawenforcement has been aggressively investigating the allegations of victims ofritual abuse. There is little or no evidence for the portion of theirallegationsthat deals with large-scale baby-breeding, human sacrifice, and organizedsatanic conspiracies.” ( Investigator’s Guide to Allegations of “Ritual” ChildAbuse, January 1992)• does not exist in the United States, as concluded by an exhaustive nationalstudy for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect: “In a survey ofmore than 11,000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the country,conducted for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, researchersfound more than 12,000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based onSatanic ritual, but not one that investigators had been able to substantiate.‘After scouring the country, we found no evidence for large-scale cults thatsexually abuse children,’ said Dr. Gail Goodman, a psychologist at theUniversity of California at Davis, who directed the survey. The survey included6,910 psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers; and 4,655district attorneys, police departments, and social service agencies. Theyreported 12,264 accusations of ritual abuse that they had investigated. Thesurvey found that there was not a single case among them where there wasclear corroborating evidence for the most common accusation, that there was“a well-organized, intergenerational Satanic cult who sexually molested andtortured children in their homes or schools for years and committed a series ofmurders,” said Goodman. (Daniel Goleman, New York Times, reprinted SanFrancisco Chronicle 11/1/94)But in the 1980s the “SRA” myth, and monetary/publicity scams based on it,continued to rage unabated nationwide. The Department of Defense community wasnot immune from the epidemic. By November 1987 there had been 15 child-sex-abuseaccusation scares at Army day-care centers and elementary schools alone. In late1986it was the turn of the Presidio of San Francisco.- 10 -Chapter 1: Gary HambrightCaveatThe accusations against Presidio day-care teacher Gary Hambright marked thebeginning of the Presidio “day-care sexual abuse” episode of 1986-87. Until inmid-1987 Chaplain Larry Adams-Thompson [hereafter abbreviated as “A-T” in mywriting] and his wife Michele decided to accuse my wife Lilith and myself aswell,Hambright was the sole target of parents, therapists, and investigators.From July 1986 to July 1987, Lilith and I were living 3,000 miles away inWashington, D.C., where I was a student in the Industrial College of the ArmedForces,National Defense University. We had no idea that this episode was going on atthePresidio, nor would have felt any personal concern had we heard of it. At thatpoint wesimply weren’t paying much attention to the McMartin Preschool and copycatwitch-hunts, considering them just another tragic example of fundamentalist extremismgoneberserk.Therefore I did not collect information concerning the Gary Hambright situationatthe Presidio, nor did I do so significantly subsequent to the Adams-Thompsons’attackon us. None of the other Presidio parents were accusing us of anything, andfrankly wehad no idea who Hambright was or whether he might actually have harmed anychildren. So we left him alone to handle his own predicament while we focused onourown.Hence this chapter is less comprehensive than subsequent ones, assembled fromwhat facts I did come across in the media and from one August 1989 officemeetingwith the public defenders who had previously handled Hambright’s case. But Ineverhad any contact with any of the accusing parents, and of course I never hadaccess toany of the investigative documents concerning Hambright or any of the childrenbesides Kinsey Almond/A-T.This chapter, then, represents the most accurate, factual, and comprehensivepictureI have been able to assemble of the Hambright events.Prior to the Tobin AccusationsThere were no allegations of any sort against Gary Hambright, a Baptist ministerworking as a teacher at the Presidio Child Development Center, prior to November1986. This is crucially significant because in the later onslaught of parentalaccusationsagainst him, he was accused of sexual abuse acts on as many as sixty day-carechildrenfrom May 1985 to November 1986. Does it seem conceivable that not a singleparentwould have noticed a single thing wrong with even one child beforeNovember 1986? Even one such doctor or hospital visit, or police notification,wouldhave rung an alarm bell instantly. No such notification ever happened, and thisis- 11 -the first and most glaring indicator that Hambright was in fact a completelyinnocentman who was unfortunate enough to be made the convenient scapegoat of a witch-hunt.So what did inspire and trigger that witch-hunt at the Presidio?On September 28, 1986 the San Francisco Examiner 3 began a series of eightextensive, lurid, and illustrated front-page stories sensationalizing thenationwide “daycare ritual abuse” epidemic. The texts of these articles appear here asAppendices #2-9.They not only describe the witch-hunt procedures employed throughout thecountry,but are indicative of the state of bewilderment and uncertainty oflaw-enforcement andprosecutorial authorities at that point in time. Caught by surprise concerningsuch abizarre epidemic, they haplessly surrendered control of local accusations to“satanicabuse” therapists, conviction-committed prosecutors, and lynch-mob-mindedparents.Also discussed in the articles and diagrams were the vast lawsuits and claimsfiled byparents, such as $110 million in 1985 for allegations concerning the day-carecenter ofthe U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York.The stage was now set for San Francisco and its Presidio.The Tobin AccusationsOn November 14, 1986, according to her later account in a 1988 magazine4 , JoyceTobin’s (wife of Captain Michael Tobin assigned to the Presidio) 3-year-old sonDavidcame home from a day-care visit complaining that teacher Gary Hambright hadbittenhis penis and inserted a pencil painfully into his rectum. Joyce gave a slightlydifferentaccount to KTVU television, saying that the child had made no complaints whenpickedup or arriving home, but that later that evening he pulled at his penis whenwatchingtelevision, and in answer to his brother’s inquiry, said that “Mr. Gary” did it.5Although a trained nurse, Joyce did not take David for a medical examinationuntil afull week later, after a Presidio chaplain to whom her husband spoke hadcontacted theArmy Criminal Investigation Division. 6 Then she took David not to thePresidio’sLetterman Army Hospital, but to San Francisco General Hospital, where Dr. KevinCoulter issued a report saying that David’s anus showed “tears” and wasenlarged.3 In 1986 the San Francisco Examiner was the city’s second major dailynewspaper. Years later itfailed, and in 2007 its masthead remains only on a small free daily paper.4 Linda Goldston, “Army of the Night”, San Jose Mercury News West, 7/24/88.5 “Nightmare at the Presidio”, KTVU Channel 2 television documentary special,4/10/88. In this filmpediatrician Ann Parker commented that it is not at all unusual for childrenover 18 months to showan interest in, and play with their genitals.6 While I have not seen the name of the specific chaplain identified in print,the signatures of Larryand Michele A-T appear immediately below the Tobins’ on an alarm-letter toPresidio parentscirculated in approximately April 1987. No other chaplain’s name appears. So Iassume that it wasindeed Larry A-T who initially called the CID to begin the Presidio scare.- 12 -In April 1988 on a KTVU television news documentary, Coulter admitted that hehad later retracted his initial report about “tears”, saying that David’s anusshowed only“normal grooves”. Nevertheless he said that the child’s anus had seemed“unusuallylarge”.On the same documentary pediatrician Ann Parker, M.D. was asked about thisstatement. She responded that there are many perfectly normal causes for anenlargedanus in a child of that age, such as large bowel movements. Joyce Tobin statedin anaffidavit that the child had been experiencing large bowel movements at thetime. 7Indeed she stated that he had had a large bowel movement that same evening.Otherthan commenting upon the size of the stools, Joyce made no mention of anydefecationpain, or of any blood in the stools, etc. that might have evidenced actual analpenetration earlier that same day of a small, delicate 3-year-old child.Neither in the adult Tobins’ account for the extensive Linda Goldston magazinearticle footnoted here, nor in the KTVU documentary, nor in any other publishedsource I have discovered, was any mention made of injury or damage to David’spenissuch as a bite with teeth might be expected to cause, particularly to a3-year-old child.This will become significant as discussed below, since ultimately all chargesagainstHambright would be reduced to this single one.Day-Care/“Satanic Ritual” Abuse ChecklistsLetters were mailed to 242 Presidio parents, and checklists of “symptoms” ofchildsex-abuse were circulated [see Appendices #10 and #11].Such checklists, created by “therapists” aggressively dedicated to “findings” ofsex-abuse, had become nationally notorious for their inclusion of virtually everynormalinterest or action of a child as a “symptom”. As a consequence of MichelleRemembers,the industry had also begun to dress up such checklists with imagined “Satanicritual”symptoms.One of the most well-known and widely-circulated such lists in 1986 was that ofCatherine Gould [Appendix #11]. Investigators later confirmed to me that thiswasindeed one of the lists circulated among Presidio parents.In this list it will be seen that many ordinary and even mutually-contradictoryformsof behavior are symptoms of “Satanic ritual abuse and sexual abuse”, for exampleachild who is either rebellious or compliant, who gets angry or play-acts or islazy inschool, or who touches his or her genitals. [Interlaced with these, hencelendingcredibility to them, are a few obviously valid warning signs, such as physicalinjury, thepresence of semen, etc.] The checklist also warns parents that any officialinvestigationwill be incompetent, and also that even the most excellent reputation of aschool orday-care facility means nothing. In short, a climate comparable to thewitch-hunts of7 KTVU, op.cit.- 13 -medieval Europe is created, in which anything and everything is “proof” ofwitchcraftand no defense is possible or admissible. 8Thus the mere fact of accusation meant that abuse had definitely occurred andHambright was definitely guilty. His denials and those of all the other teachersmeantnothing.9 The absence of any physical damage to any child meant nothing. Theabsenceof child complaints or allegations at any time in the 1-1/2 years prior to theTobinaccusation meant nothing. Indeed any inconvenient evidence of innocence wasautomatically ignored.Motives for AccusationSuch was the “day-care abuse” agenda which Presidio parents, administrators, andlocal law enforcement investigators were now pursuing, as in so many previousinstances of the national hysteria. Twenty years later it seems surprising thattheycould all have been so gullible and compliant. But it must be noted that theaverageAmerican adult in those days knew nothing whatever about child sexual predators,“abnormal” child behavior, or psychological therapy procedures. As for the“S-word” -“satanism” - for the vast public who had not actually encountered the Church ofSatan,it was a nightmare reference to secret cult activity so ghastly that the mindcouldscarcely picture it. 10 This played right into the hands of the “SRAtherapists”, who couldthus attribute whatever they wished to such faceless, anonymous, heinous“satanists”.A more opportunistic explanation is, as again in previous “day-care abuse”episodes,parents soon realized that multimillion-dollar claims could be filed, whiletherapistsand prosecutors saw an opportunity for headlines, fame, and professionaladvancement. Conveniently there was no risk for the parent and therapistaccusers,8 Obviously Gould and other “SRA therapists” neither knew nor cared that theirdescriptions of“satanic abuse” had no basis whatever in authentic religious Satanism as it hadbeen openly definedand practiced in the United States since the formation of the Church of Satan in1966.9 In the KTVU documentary the day-care teacher with whom Hambright co-hosted hisclass at thecenter, Susan Mihata, stated that there was no private area in the center whereHambright would havebeen able to take a child unobserved. She further stated that she would neverhave allowed Hambrightto leave her alone with the 30 children of the class, because that ratio ofsupervision would have beenagainst the law. Mihata said that she not only never saw Hambright abusinganyone, but that she wasnever once interviewed or questioned by investigators. Hambright’s class wasalso a “temporary dropoff/pick up” one, with parents arriving and departing unannounced all the time.This was verified onKTVU by Federal Public Defender Geoffrey Hansen, who stated that he had reviewedall of theCenter’s assignment/attendance records.10 As noted in the Introduction, we who had openly and authentically beeninvolved with the Satanicreligion since the 1960s never anticipated that such widespread ignorance andfear of it still existed inthe 1980s. To see popular fantasies of such depraved and vicious acts, sexualand otherwise,attributed to it was almost incomprehensible. The record would eventually be setstraight through ourpublic efforts and those of responsible academic and law-enforcementauthorities, but not in 1986when the “SRA” witch-hunts were at their height.- 14 -because they always insisted that they themselves were not accusing anyone -theywere merely “conveying the children’s accusations”. For adult accusers,therefore, itwas an ideal scenario in which they were sheltered from any consequences offalseaccusations. They proclaimed that “little children never lie about sexualabuse”, whichin 1986 still worked with enough juries to have sent numerous “satanic ritualabuse”-accused adults to prison on no other evidence whatever.That innocent victims might go to prison [and probably be severely brutalized orkilled there], and that their own little children would need to be indoctrinatedtobelieve and recite the most horrific and disgusting “sexual abuse” tothemselves, wereinconvenient, and therefore irrelevant considerations.First Arrest and Charges/DismissalIn December 1986 Hambright was arrested and charged with “lewd conduct,sodomy, and oral copulation of a 3-year-old boy” [David Tobin]. In March 1987,however, when a federal judge disallowed hearsay testimony from parents andtherapists, prosecutors asked that the case be dismissed. Apparently there wasno otherevidence of any crime. 11Debbie Hickey and “Play Therapy”The dismissal of the charges against Hambright was merely a momentary setback.By this time scores of children were in extensive programs of “play therapy”beingconducted by Major Deborah “Debbie” Hickey, a psychiatrist assigned to thePresidio’sLetterman Army Medical Center. According to the KTVU television documentary,Hickey proceeded to diagnose sex-abuse in several of the children, including herown.Parents were instructed not to question their own children at all - to leavequestioningexclusively to Hickey. 12Hickey repeatedly refused to speak with the KTVU reporters, either on- or off-camera. 13 When asked by KTVU why Hickey, as a personally-interested parent, wasallowed to diagnose and treat all of the children, Presidio Commander JosephRaffertyanswered only that the Letterman Hospital commander apparently did not think itimproper. 14The accounts, as later reported by the press, were of the fantastic andincoherentvariety exemplified by the Gould checklist. Children said that they had gunspointed atthem, that they had played baseball with human excrement, and that “Mr.11 San Francisco Chronicle 1/4/88.12 Colleen Parker, parent, KTVU, op.cit.13 Bob MacKenzie, KTVU, op.cit.14 KTVU, op.cit.- 15 -Gary” [Hambright] had a shark in a bowl on his kitchen table which he took achildhome with him to feed, and that they had “played penis guitar”. 15 All of thisfantasticnonsense was held to somehow validate mass sexual molestation at the center.No Physical/Medical EvidenceApart from Hickey’s “play therapy”, there are no published accounts I could everfind that prior to the November 1986 Tobin accusation any child attending thePresidiocenter was ever taken to a doctor or emergency room for examination/care becauseofan apparent adult rape/sodomy, or that upon the publicizing of the scandalitself anymedical examinations of any of the children had revealed any physical evidenceofsexual molestation. Other than Coulter’s waffling and uncertain statementsconcerningthe Tobin child, there was therefore no medical evidence that anythinghappened to any of the children. 16Chlamydia?Following medical examinations given to the children when the scare commenced,itwas announced to the press that some of the children had chlamydia, a venerealdisease which can be transmitted by sexual contact. 17 As this was the firstapparentphysical proof that the children had indeed been sexually abused, the pressrepeatedlymentioned it:According to [Presidio Commander Colonel] Rafferty’s letter, three of thechildrenhave tested positive for chlamydia, a curable, relatively common disease that ismostoften sexually transmitted. 18[Hambright’s attorney] Bondoc said Hambright was served with a search warrant“two or three weeks ago” so that authorities could test him for chlamydia, asexuallytransmitted disease. Four of the alleged victims in the case have contracted thedisease. 1915 Goldston; KTVU, op.cit.16 On the KTVU documentary, prosecuting U.S. Attorney Joseph Russinello stated,“In all but one ofthose ten cases [in the second Hambright indictment] we had no physicalevidence.” The “one” casewas presumably that of David Tobin, with Russinello referring to Dr. Coulter’sopinion concerning thesize of his rectum.17 “An internal Army memo of 19 November 1987 concluded that there were fiveconfirmed cases ofchlamydia.” Bob MacKensie, KTVU, op.cit.18 Edward Lempinen, “More Kids Involved in Molest Probe”, San FranciscoChronicle 8/12/87.19 Goldston, “10 More Claim Molestation at S.F. Presidio Child Center”, San JoseMercury News8/13/87.- 16 -Federal investigators have since [the first dismissal of charges] concluded thatatleast 58 children who attended the center were molested, and that at least ahalf-dozenhad chlamydia, a curable venereal disease. 20At least a half-dozen children had chlamydia, a venereal disease. 21There were five confirmed cases of chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease,including two of the four daughters of one family. 22Referring to the victims, the parents said, “… many have documented medicalevidence of sexual abuse, including rape, sodomy, and venereal disease.” 23Two of the Runyans’ four daughters were among the victims; both had confirmedcases of chlamydia. 24There were five confirmed cases of chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease. 25Upon being alerted to the chlamydia allegations, Hambright’s attorney hadn’twaited for the search warrant test:Bondoc, who said his client is innocent, said he sent Hambright to his personalphysician on the same day for a separate chlamydia test. “That came backnegative, andI was able to confirm that the government’s test was also negative. So hedoesn’t havechlamydia. 26 27It was later brought out, however, that the tests used to detect chlamydia weresoinaccurate that none of them could be used in court:The cases of chlamydia could not be used as evidence because the right kind ofcultures had not been taken at Letterman Army Medical Center. When one couplecalled20 Lempinen, “The Defense Strategy in Presidio Molestation Case”, San FranciscoChronicle 1/4/88.21 Lempinen, “Angry Parents Want Trial in Presidio Case”, San FranciscoChronicle 4/20/88.22 Goldston, “Army of the Night”, op.cit.23 Ibid.24 Ibid.25 Goldston, “AIDS Tests Urged in Presidio Case”, San Jose Mercury News 4/27/89.26 Goldston, “10 More Claim Molestation ...”, op.cit.27 I might note in passing here that after the A-T accusations were made,Lilith’s and my own medicalrecords verified that we had never had either chlamydia or any other venerealdisease either.- 17 -the U.S. Attorney’s Office to ask if they should take their children for anotherculture,the answer was no. 28Dr. Bonnie Dattel, “an internationally recognized expert on chlamydia”29, saidthatonly a preliminary screening had been done by Letterman Hospital, not theconclusive,follow-up culture testing. As the children in question had then been treated forthedisease, culture testing was now pointless.30According to San Francisco Chronicle reporter Edward Lempinen, chlamydia canalso be transmitted from a mother to her unborn fetus. 31 A Blue Cross pamphletelaborates:Chlamydia or NSU (non-specific urethritis). Cause: Bacteria. Symptoms:Discharge from genitals or rectum. Pain when urinating. There may be nosymptoms,especially in women. When they appear: 7-21 days. How acquired: Direct contactwithinfected mucus membrane (genitals, mouth, eye, rectum). 32In the absence of any sign of sexual violation of the children involved, it isreasonable to suppose that if any child had the disease, it could have beencontractedin any number of ordinary, accidental ways. I am aware of no evidence toindicate thatthe mothers of the children in question were examined and found to be free ofthedisease themselves, or had no medical history of being treated for it since thebirth oftheir children. 33 Presumably for officials to insist that this moreunremarkableexplanation be explored would have outraged the parents, who were alreadyvehemently criticizing the Army, to even greater vocal indignation.It is logical to conclude, therefore, that the absence of chlamydia in GaryHambright established that:• He could not have given it to any child who tested positive for it.• He did not contract it through oral/genital contact from any infectedchild.28 Goldston, “Army of the Night”, op.cit.29 KTVU, op.cit.30 Ibid.31 Lempinen, “Ex-Presidio Worker Under FBI Probe in Molestations”, San FranciscoChronicle8/11/87.32 Blue Cross of California Pamphlet, “How to Prevent AIDS and Other SexuallyTransmittedDiseases” 1994.33 Note the comment in the Blue Cross pamphlet that “there may be no symptoms,especially inwomen”.- 18 -So, although the media kept stating that several children had “confirmed casesofchlamydia” as though this “proved” the allegations of rape and sodomy againstHambright, in actuality - assuming those children did have the disease, it wasanexoneration of Hambright. This simple point was never, ever made.AIDS?A scare in the local media occurred when one child was initially reported astestingpositively for AIDS. This test result was later shown to be false. 34Nevertheless, as withthe chlamydia, this development continued to be brought up as “additionalevidence”that sex-abuse had taken place.A second AIDS scare occurred in 1989:The Army has recommended that more than 60 children who said they were sexuallyabused at the Presidio of San Francisco be tested for the AIDS virus …Bob Mahoney, speaking for the Presidio, said Wednesday the step is being takenbecause “there is a rumor going around that an individual who was suspected ofparticipating in the child abuse case has AIDS” …35That “individual” was Hambright, who at that time was known to be dying of AIDS.Ihave seen no information that, if any of the Presidio children were tested forHIV/AIDS, any of the tests were positive. If none of the children who had beenalleged tohave been orally, anally, or vaginally raped/sodomized by Hambright hadcontractedHIV/AIDS at that time, of course, this is additional proof that theHIV/AIDS-positiveHambright did none of these things to any of them.Second Arrest and Charges/DismissalApparently solely on the basis of Hickey’s “play therapy diagnoses”, GaryHambrightwas rearrested in September 1987 and charged with “two counts of oral copulationandten counts of lewd & lascivious conduct between 5/1/85 and 11/21/86”.By February 17, 1988 a federal judge dismissed all but one of the chargesagainstHambright as being unsubstantiated. Only a single charge concerning David Tobinremained: oral copulation. Apparently even Dr. Coulter’s fallback diagnosis ofDavid’srectum had been abandoned by now. “Oral copulation” at least could be argued toleaveno physical mark or damage - although David’s parents had originally insistedthat hehad complained of his penis being bitten (which would presumably have resultedinsuch marks and medical exam-detectible damage).On January 7, 1988 one of Hambright’s attorneys filed the following Declarationwith the court:34 Goldston, “Army of the Night”, op.cit.35 Goldston, “AIDS Tests Urged in Presidio Case”, op.cit.- 19 -I, Nanci L. Clarence, declare:1. I am an Assistant Federal Public Defender representing defendant GaryHambright in this case.2. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of a letter datedDecember15, 1986 sent from the Director of Personnel and Community Activities, Lt. Col.WalterMeyer.3. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of a letter dated 1May 1987from Joseph V. Rafferty and three pages of attachments.4. Attached hereto as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of a two-pagememorandum from Walter W. Meyer and two pages of attachments.5. In preparation of these motions, I have reviewed copies of FBI 302 reportsprovided to the defendant by this government. The quotations and paraphrases ofstatements made by parents and children involved in this investigation weretakendirectly and accurately from these 302 reports and/or other discovery providedby thegovernment. These documents have not been attached to this declaration in theinterestof protecting the privacy of the children and their families.6. I have reviewed the videotape of an interview of David Tobin, age 3,conducted bythe Army Criminal Investigative Unit (“CID”) on November 21, 1986 at thePresidio ofSan Francisco.7. During the interview, one of the interviewers introduced the topic ofpreschool byasking David whether there was anybody at preschool who should be spanked. Theinterviewer then asked David whether “Mr. Gary” was bad and whether he should bespanked. This question was asked repeatedly during the interview.During the interview, David made several other statements about the defendant.Inresponse to the interviewer’s questions about “what Mr. Gary did”, Davidanswered that“Mr. Gary” bit him on his penis. Moments later, David stated that “Mr. Gary” hadbithim on the arm and that Eric, another boy at daycare, bit his penis. DespiteDavid’sinconsistency on this subject, the interviewer continued to focus on thequestion of what“Mr. Gary” had done. In contrast, the interviewer failed to ask follow-upquestionsabout the alleged biting incident with Eric. At another point in the interview,Daviddenied that “Mr. Gary” had touched his penis or done anything wrong.During the interview, the interviewer encouraged David to make use ofanatomicallycorrect dolls, apparently in an attempt to assist David’s description of theallegedmisconduct. However, the techniques employed by the interviewer in using thedollsappeared to encourage certain responses to the questions. For example, at onepoint,the interviewer told David to “show him what Mr. Gary did.” Immediatelythereafter,the interviewer told David he could take the pants off the doll. This, and otherleading orsuggestive lines of questioning, were used throughout the interview.8. I also observed that David’s mother and father were each present at theinterviewduring different intervals, and that David sat on his parent’s lap during mostof theinterview.I declare under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct ofmyown knowledge.Dated: January 8, 1988/s/ Nanci L. Clarence- 20 -NANCI L. CLARENCEAssistant Federal Public Defender36“What I saw on the videotape,” said Clarence on KTVU, “was a very terrified3-year-old sitting on his mother’s lap being interrogated by a rather large,well-meaning, butsomewhat gruff officer.” 37Subsequently, on February 17, 1988, “the final count of oral copulation againsttheformer Southern Baptist minister was dismissed by U.S. District Judge WilliamSchwarzer after the parents of the alleged victim said their child could notwithstandthe rigors of the trial.” 38A different reason was given by the Tobins to Linda Goldston: David “was removedfrom the case a short time later on the advice of the boy’s therapist”. 39It is easy to see why that therapist would not wish to defend the coached andextracted “allegations of David” discovered by Clarence above, and it isdifficult to seehow that discovery could constitute any “rigor” to David. Indeed such “rigors”wouldapply instead to the adults present on that videotape: the “interviewer”,Michael Tobin,and Joyce Tobin.This final exposé of the manufactured witch-hunt against Hambright may havedemolished his formal prosecution, but it didn’t prevent the disappointedparents fromgiving “righteously indignant” interviews to the media:Ten Army parents whose children were among the 60 apparently abused at thePresidio day-care center rebuked federal prosecutors yesterday for failing totake thecase to trial ... They accused prosecutors of being “highly irresponsible” andchargedthat the Army’s response to the apparent epidemic of abuse has been “pitiful”.40Clearly acknowledgment of Gary Hambright’s innocence, and admission that thewhole sensational episode had ultimately been exposed as nothing more thananotherbaseless “play therapy ritual abuse” scam, was emotionally intolerable to theseparents- who, it must be noted, would in that case have no grounds at all for the $74million inclaims they had filed against the Army on the grounds that the “abuse” hadactuallyhappened.36 Declaration of Nanci L.

Readers of the San Francisco Chronicle, whosereporter Edward Lempinen had continually written uncritical and inflammatoryarticles about the Presidio witch-hunt throughout its duration, learned fromanotherreporter two years later:The Baptist minister accused of sexually abusing dozens of children at thePresidio ofSan Francisco’s child care center in 1986 has died of AIDS in Yakima,Washington,closing a chapter in the unsolved molestation case.Gary Hambright, 36, died November 8, his sister Carolyn Tatro of Yakima saidyesterday. Hambright, a Yakima native, was twice indicted for sexually molestingchildren at the Presidio Child Development Center. Both indictments weredismissed,and Hambright insisted on his innocence until his death.“This seems to be the sad, final chapter in the story,” said Nanci Clarence, oneof twofederal public defenders who represented Hambright in the child molestationcase.“Gary died with a clear conscience. It’s just too bad he had to spend the finaltwo yearsof his life battling these baseless charges.”Hambright’s sister said he returned to live with his family in Washington afterhebecame ill. “We loved him very much, and we wanted to be together,” she said. 41Implications of Information Presented in this ChapterNo children were sexually molested by Gary Hambright at the Presidioof San Francisco Child Development Center during the September 1985-November 1986 period of Hambright’s employment as a teacher there.Parents were predisposed to suspect molestation and “satanic ritual abuse”becauseof a wave of such accusations about day-care centers across the United States,and aSeptember 1986 series of front-page articles in a major San Francisco newspaperhighlighting them.An alternate parental motive for making day-care “abuse” allegations wasknowledge, through that newspaper and other sources, of the sizable claims andlawsuit awards, extending into multimillions of dollars per family to be awardedas aresult of such allegations.In 1986-87 law-enforcement investigators were still uncertain as to how to dealobjectively, methodically, and fairly with such politically and emotionallyexplosiveallegations. It had become standard practice to place alleged child victims inthe care oftherapists using “play therapy” not just to treat emotionally-distressedchildren but tostate that a physical crime had been committed against them. Such statements bytherapists were made independent and in disregard of any physical evidence tothe41 Bill Wallace, “AIDS Kills Minister Accused of Molesting”, San FranciscoChronicle 1/6/90.- 22 -contrary. At least one such therapist was responsible for all “findings ofabuse” at thePresidio.Parents and therapists were free to make criminal accusations without fear oflegalconsequences to themselves, because they always took the position that they wereonly“repeating what the child had told them”. “Play therapy” techniques includedcoaching,enticing, and threatening children until a desired response was elicited; anypreviousresponses to the contrary were simply ignored.- 23 -Chapter 2: The Larry Adams-Thompson AccusationAmong the children who had been under the care of Gary Hambright at the Presidioday-care center was Kinsey Almond/A-T, who, once she attained age 3 on September1,1986, was an occasional drop-off/pick-up. Hambright’s classes included childrenonlyage 3 and older.42On January 14, 1987 Kinsey’s stepfather Chaplain (Captain) Larry A-T and hermother Michele A-T were interviewed as part of the Tobin allegations follow-upby FBISpecial Agent Patricia Peyton [all sic]:FD-302FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONDate of transcription 1/26/87CAPTAIN LARRY ADAMS-THOMPSON and MRS MICHELE ADAMS-THOMPSONwere interviewed at the Child Psychology Clinic at Letterman Hospital. They wereawarethat the interview was in regard to possible cases of child molestation by ateacher at thePresidio Child Development Center.Mrs. ADAMS-THOMPSON advised that her daughter, KINSEY, had been attendingthe school since spring, 1986. When she turned three in September, she wastransferredto “Mr. GARY’s” (GARY HAMBRIGHT) class. Kinsey attended Mr. GARY’s class fourtimes in September, 1986, and twice in October, 1986. She had always enjoyedschool,and liked Mr. GARY very much at first. The second and third time she attendedhisclass, she wet her pants, which was very unusual behavior for KINSEY. She becamereluctant to go to school and would get fussy, which Mrs. ADAMS-THOMPSON saidwas very unusual. KINSEY would tell her mother that she did not want to go toschoolbecause she did not like it.On January 6, 1987, Mrs. ADAMS-THOMPSON took KINSEY to school for the firsttime in several months and KINSEY said “I don’t want to see Mr. GARY.” When Mrs.ADAMS-THOMPSON asked if Mr. GARY had been mean to her or tried to touch her,KINSEY replied negatively. When told she would be having a new teacher, KINSEYagreed to go. She liked the new teacher very much and now enjoys going toschool.When questioned about behavioral changes, MRS. ADAMS-THOMPSON repliedthat during the fall of 1986, KINSEY started waking up crying during the night.This wasunusual and stopped shortly before Christmas. She also seemed to be more defiantandargumentative with family members. She described KINSEY as outgoing and said sheisvery comfortable with men and women and that her behavior has not altered.Mrs. ADAMS-THOMPSON provided the following information regarding KINSEY:Full name:KINSEY MARIE ALMONDAge:Three yearsDate of birth:September 1, 198342 See Appendix #10.- 24 -Address:1431 “D” Battery Caulfield,Presidio, CaliforniaTelephone number: 752-4795Parents:Captain LARRY ADAMS-THOMPSON, Step-fatherMICHELE ADAMS-THOMPSON, motherSiblings:One sister, seven years, two step-brothers,nine and thirteen years.____________________________________________________________Investigation on 1/14/87 at San Francisco, CaliforniaFile # SF 70A-111158-56by SA PATRICIA J. PEYTON/lwDate dictated 1/14/87The existence and contents of this FBI FD-302 were concealed from me by the FBI,the San Francisco Police Department, and the Army Criminal InvestigationDivision(CID). I first learned of it when, on September 20, 1989, Federal PublicDefender NanciClarence sent me a photocopy. Once I read it, the efforts to suppress it wereinstantlyunderstandable. It established that:•The A-Ts had not noticed any abnormal behavior by Kinsey prior to “the fall of1986”.•Her “fall of 1986” unusual behavior was not identifiable to sexual molestationor other bodily injury.•She had made no statements to her parents about anyone at the Presidio day-care center hurting or touching her improperly.•She was not assigned to Gary Hambright as a teacher until she attained age 3on 9/1/86.•She specifically denied that Hambright had ever “been mean to her or tried totouch her”.•During the entire period of her stays at the day-care center, she had never beentaken to a doctor or hospital for examination or treatment of any physicalinjury or condition related or consequent to those stays.•After becoming aware of the Tobin allegations in November 1986, the A-Tshad no hesitation about continuing to leave Kinsey at the day-care center[despite their later accusation which would imply a conspiracy of concealmentby Hambright’s fellow teachers and supervisors].- 25 -In short, it was strong evidence in exoneration of Gary Hambright where KinseyAlmond was concerned, and it was conclusive evidence in exoneration of Lilithandmyself - since we were documented to be in Washington, D.C. on every dateduring September-October 1986 when Kinsey was in Hambright’s class atthe day-care center. 43On March 12, 1987 Kinsey received a thorough physical examination at LettermanHospital’s Pediatrics Clinic. Dr. John Sheridan, who conducted the examination,wasaware of the ongoing day-care abuse allegations, because he headed his report“3-1/2 yrold female. Alleged victim of sexual abuse in Post Day Care Center”. Thereforehe hadevery reason to look specifically for any signs that such abuse had happened toKinsey.He wrote his findings [sic] [emphasis mine]:HEENT - WNL. Chest - Clear. Abd - Benign. Skin - Clear.Genitalia: Ext - WNL, Vagina - Hymenal ring intact, no disch. Rect - Noevidence of laceration, normal tone.Imp: No physical evidence of abuse.HIV antibody test. VDRL. GC throat, rectum, Vag Pool. 44Despite their knowledge of Kinsey’s history as contained in the FBI FD-302report,as well as her physically-unharmed condition as verified by this medicalexamination,the A-Ts had decided to schedule Kinsey for “play-therapy” sessions withpsychiatristDebbie Hickey beginning February 1987.“Play therapy” was the most common and notorious feature of the nationwide“ritualabuse” scares, leading to usually-multiple allegations of rape, sodomy, andsimilarcrimes where no other evidence existed to substantiate them. One privateinvestigatorobserves:The nature of the customary sexual abuse treatment given to children when thereisan accusation of sexual abuse is insight oriented, dynamic, and feelingexpressivepsychotherapy (Wakefield & Underwager, 1988).A child is forced to continue talking about feelings, acting out in play, andresponding to questions about having been abused.Researchers, after reviewing records of several hundred cases, have found atmost ahalf dozen where the therapy provided to a child was anything other than insightoriented, feeling expressive therapy. With younger children, it is exclusivelyplaytherapy.In the videotapes of therapy that researchers reviewed, they have seen childrenbeinggiven a toy gun and taught to shoot a Bobo doll identified as Bad Daddy,children43 During September-October 1986 I was on active duty as a student at theIndustrial College of theArmed Forces, National Defense University, where daily attendance was of courserequired andrecords kept for all student officers.44 Standard Form 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care, Adams-ThompsonKinsey#02-56276-34-92, Letterman Army Medical Center, 3/12/87.- 26 -encouraged to throw darts at pictures of the person accused, make clay figuresof theperson accused and then pound them with mallets and hammers, and throw dollsidentified as the person accused in boxes labeled jail.Children are reinforced for yelling screaming, saying angry and hostile thingsaboutthe person accused. Children are taught to be fearful, to believe they have beenvictimized, and to believe people they love are wicked and evil.Play therapy of this nature cannot be anything other than destructive andharmful tothe child (Campbell, 1992a; 1992b; Russ, 1987; Trad, 1992; Casey, & Berman,1985).When a child who has not been abused is treated by adults who have concluded thechild has been abused, it is tragically the case that the adults teach the childto be avictim. If a child continuously denies the abuse the adult believes in, theadult does notaccept that no abuse occurred. Instead, the adult concludes the child isdissociating,repressing the memory, and may give a diagnosis of Multiple PersonalityDisorder. Thechild is then coerced and forced to develop this most serious iatrogenic malady.The endresult may well be the destruction of the child for any normal adult life. 45Dr. Terence Campbell, a distinguished, board-certified psychologist, comments:1. Any evidence supporting the effectiveness of play therapy for children is ischaracterized by its conspicuous absence.2. For example, play therapy does not appear to enhance academic or intellectualachievement.3. Treatment effects for play therapy are conspicuously absent when dealing withspecific behavioral disorders.4. Moreover, play therapy does not improve the interpersonal adjustment ofchildrenwho participate in it.5. As long ago as in 1975, a review of treatment approaches for childrenemphasizedthat the era of blind faith in the activities of play therapy had ended. Inother words,play therapy amounts to what - at best - is an experimental treatment not knownto beeffective.6. The parents of children participating play therapy assume their childrenrespondpositively to this treatment. These parental impressions, however, are notsupported byobjective data. In other words, the outcomes parents attribute to theirchildren’stherapy are influenced more by their excessively optimistic expectations thananythingelse.7. Related data also demonstrate that play therapy does not effectively aidchildrenknown to have been abused. The study supporting this conclusion reported: “Noconsistent support was found for the hypothesis that time-limited play therapywouldimprove the adjustment of maltreated preschoolers who already were attending atherapeutic preschool.”8. In cases of suspected sexual abuse, however, play therapy can distort andconfusethe recall of children.45 Allen Cowling - Cowling Investigations, Inc. http://www.allencowling.com- 27 -9. In these cases of distorted memory, the therapist becomes the source of whatthechild remembers rather than the event in question. 46After four “play therapy” sessions with Kinsey, Hickey informed her parents thatshehad “disclosed being molested”. 47 Based on this, and despite their knowledge tothecontrary as evidenced in the 1/14/87 FBI FD-302 and the 3/12/87 medicalexamination, Larry and Michele A-T in April 1987 accused Gary Hambright ofsexuallyabusing Kinsey. The letter to Hambright from the Presidio Headquarters stated:You sexually abused a three-year-old child, Kinsey Adams-Thompson, on at leastone occasion while she was in your care at the Presidio Child DevelopmentCenter. Suchact or acts took place sometime in September or October 1986 at the ChildDevelopmentCenter, Presidio of San Francisco. 48 49Exactly what took place during the months of Hickey’s “play therapy” sessionswithKinsey and the other Presidio day-care children she pronounced as “sexuallyabused”remained a secret for years. FOIA/PA requests were refused on the basis of theconfidentiality of medical records. It is even doubtful that the FBI and theSFPD eversaw the “play therapy” records of Kinsey - for if they had seen how bizarre andincoherent they were, and compared those actual records with what Lawrence andMichele claimed they proved, their accusations would presumably have beendiscredited right then.During the San Francisco Police investigation of Lilith and myself, as well asthelater CID investigation, the Hickey records remained concealed. When allinvestigations were closed, they still remained concealed. At any time, ofcourse, Larry46 Terence W. Campbell, Ph.D. (University of Maryland 1970).

Gunnarson, Director, Child Development Services Branch,Presidio to GaryHambright 4/17/87.49 Note the specific location and date-window. Kinsey had been under Hambright’ssupervision onlyduring this time period [because of her age], and then only as an unscheduleddrop-off/pick-up“babysitting” child. This would have made any transportation for molestationaway from and back tothe center quite impossible. The date-window would become crucial later, whenthe CID - frustratedby our verified location in Washington, D.C. during that window - sought tosolve their problem byarbitrarily revising the dates of the accusation several months back to June1987. This illegal action bythe CID will be discussed in detail later.- 28 -and Michele A-T could have given permission for them to be released to me, butclearlythat was not in their interest, as the contents would later reveal.I finally obtained the original Hickey “play-therapy” notes in April 1991throughDiscovery in my lawsuit against the Army over the fraudulent CID Report ofInvestigation. 50 Even then, and of course in violation of federal Discoverylaw, manypages had been removed and remained concealed. As it was the CID’s position thatthenotes provided contained all information pertinent to the A-Ts’ accusations andtheCID Report, I reviewed and analyzed those notes on that premise. The completenotes[received] are at Appendix #12, and my analysis of them is at Appendix #13. Itshouldbe borne in mind that, in all of my 1987-3/1991 efforts to defend ourselves andprosecute Larry A-T, this crucial information was completely concealed from me.In August 1987, still completely unaware of the “sex abuse” scandal at thePresidio,Lilith and I returned to our home in San Francisco after a year in Washington,D.C.,where I had been a student in the prestigious Industrial College of the ArmedForces,National Defense University.51On 8/12/87 Lilith and I drove to the Presidio Post Exchange to buy a microwaveoven. As far as we were concerned, it was a completely uneventful shopping trip.Unknown to us, however, at least one of the adult A-Ts had also been present atthePX and had recognized us there. At 4:45 that afternoon Larry A-T telephoned theFBIoffice and initiated his accusations against us, as recorded in the FBI FD-302of thatconversation:FD-302FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONDate of transcription 8/13/87LARRY ADAMS-THOMPSON, address 1431 D Battery Caulfield, Presidio ArmyBase, San Francisco, California, telephonically contacted SA GALYEAN atapproximately 4:45 pm and thereafter furnished the following information:LARRY is the father of KINSEY ADAMS-THOMPSON and was present with her atapproximately 4:00 pm on August 12, 1987, at the Post Exchange, Presidio ArmyBase.At that time KINSEY was observed by LARRY to become visibly frightened uponobserving a male and female whom KINSEY identified as “MIKEY” and “SHAMBY”.LARRY also observed the male and female and noted that the male made eye contactwith KINSEY but averted his gaze from LARRY. LARRY was immediately aware thatKINSEY was referring to the MIKEY and SHAMBY whom KINSEY had previouslyreported to them as having been at the residence where she was sexually molestedby50 Certificate of Service, Patrick Lisowski, 4/17/91.51 Only one U.S. Army Reserve officer each year is selected for this SeniorService College (regarded asa training-ground for future generals and admirals).

LARRY and KINSEY then went to their automobile in the parkinglot of the Post Exchange and waited for MIKEY and SHAMBY to exit the PostExchange.LARRY stated that he was familiar with the male as being Lieutenant Colonel MIKEAQUINO, who was previously associated with a physical training program at thePresidio. LARRY had also observed the female SHAMBY to be at several functionswithLieutenant Colonel AQUINO and had been known as AQUINO’s wife. Upon observingAQUINO and the female exit the Post Exchange LARRY observed the couple enter aredIsuzu Mark I automobile and then obtained the license tag number, which he wrotedown as California License Number 2ENS452. LARRY and KINSEY thereafter returnedto their residence where KINSEY was observed to be extremely frightened thatMIKEYand SHAMBY would come to her residence and harm her. LARRY further stated thatKINSEY was very talkative about the bad things MIKEY and SHAMBY had done to heralong with HAMBRIGHT at the residence away from the Day-care Center.LARRY was advised that SA FOREMAN would interview KINSEY and family inperson as soon as possible.____________________________________________________________Investigation on 8/12/87 at SAN FRANCISCO, TELEPHONEFile # SF 70A-111158by SA HUGH W. GALYEAN/mwtDate dictated 8/13/87Significantly neither this FC-302 nor the ones of Michele and Kinsey thatfollowed itwere made or cited as exhibits in the CID’s final 1990 Report of Investigation(ROI).Indeed they were again all concealed from me until the Discovery phase of my1991lawsuit Aquino v Stone forced their disclosure by the CID. So why had it beenfelt sonecessary to hide them?To begin with, there was no evidence which or how many of the A-Ts had been atthePX [although obviously at least one of the two adults was], or that any of the“recognition/behavior” events ever happened at all. Had Lilith or I noticed anysuchclose-up commotion as described, I’m sure at least one of us would have paidattentionto it and probably spoken to the adult(s) on the spot. Neither at this time norat anyfuture time did the FBI/SFPD/CID attempt to interview anyone at the PX forwitnessor corroboration (such as the checkout cashier processing the microwavepurchase).Looking in detail at Larry’s statements to Galyean:• They falsified and contradicted what Kinsey had actually said in the Hickeynotes during all of the six months of sessions to date. It was Michele, notKinsey, who first mentioned the name “Mikey” [during the 6/30/87 session]and described “Mikey” and “Shambee” as husband and wife. On 1/27/87“Shambee” was introduced by Kinsey as “her friend at school” who wasspanked by Mr. Rogers on TV. Kinsey added that Shambee “also had its neck- 30 -broken”, indicating that “Shambee” was either an imaginary “friend” orperhaps a doll. 52• Kinsey had never described “Shambee” and/or “Mikey” as “having been at theresidence where she was sexually molested by Gary Hambright”.• Throughout the entire PX encounter, Larry mentions only Kinsey and himselfbeing present - no other family members. This would change the next day, bywhich time, of course, he had had plenty of opportunity to discuss the scenariowith Michele and Kinsey.At 9AM the following morning (8/13/87) SA Clyde Foreman interviewed firstMichele, then Kinsey at the A-T home. Curiously he felt no need to re-interviewLarry,having no questions concerning his brief telephone statement to Galyean.FD-302FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONDate of transcription 8/13/87[All sic] MICHELLE ADAMS-THOMPSON, 1431 D Battery Caulfield, Presidio of SanFrancisco, California, was interviewed by Bureau agent who properly identifiedhimselfand explained the nature of the interview. MICHELLE ADAMS-THOMPSON providedthe following information:On Wednesday, August 12, 1987, at approximately 4:00 pm she was shopping at thePost Exchange at the Presidio of San Francisco with her husband LARRY, and herdaughter KINSEY. As they walked through the store KINSEY ran to her and LARRYandtold them that she had seen a man named “MIKEY” that she knew from Mr. GARY’Shouse.MICHELLE recalled on prior ocassions KINSEY had described MIKEY as a man whowore an army suit “like daddies” and that he had eyebrows that went up. KINSEYalsocalled MIKEY “the blood man”.MICHELLE picked KINSEY up and asked her to look across the aisle of merchandiseand point out the individual that she was referring to. KINSEY identified a malewhiteadult that LARRY ADAMS-THOMPSON knew as Colonel MICHAEL AQUINO.MICHELLE discussed With KINSEY that it was important that she be positive aboutcorrectly identifying this individual. She preceded to walk past Colonel AQUINOallowing KINSEY to view him from a distance of several feet. After walking pasthimKINSEY told her that it was infact “MIKEY” and that she wanted to leave thestorebecause she was afraid of him.LARRY ADAMS-THOMPSON escorted KINSEY to the parking lot and MICHELLEfollowed Colonel AQUINO to the checkout stand where she observed that heprovidedan active duty military identification card to the clerk in order to purchase amicrowave52 Appendices #12 & 13.- 31 -oven. MICHELLE observed him sign his name MICHAEL A. AQUINO and watched himexit the store to the parking lot.MICHELLE, LARRY, and KINSEY drove through the parking lot where theyobserved Colonel AQUINO standing next to a red vehicle with California Licenseplate2EW5453. (This vehicle was a 1987, Isuzu) KINSEY observed a women standing nexttothe vehicle and said “Thats SHAMBY”. KINSEY explained that SHAMBY was with MR.GARY and MIKEY and that she was bad with the kids.MICHELLE discussed with KINSEY whether she could talk about MIKEY and MR.GARY with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. KINSEY said that she could talkwiththe Federal Bureau of Investigation and that she would tell them how MIKEY hadputblood on her and had licked it off and that he had put his penis on her.MICHELLE said that KINSEY has frequently described “Mr. GARY’S house” as ahouse with several stairs leading to the front door and that it is gray incolor.____________________________________________________________Investigation on 8/13/87 at PRESIDIO OF SAN FRANCISCOFile # 70A-111158-209by SA CLYDE E. FOREMAN/mwtDate dictated 8/13/87Looking in detail at Michele’s statements to Foreman:• Now Michele is present at the PX too. [Additional A-Ts would be added in thefuture as an attempt to prop up the rapidly-collapsing the PX story.]• Larry said that he was “with Kinsey” in the PX. Now Michele has Kinsey“running to them”. Running requires a distance. Would the parents have lettheir 3-year-old child wander away from them in the store?• Now Kinsey “identifies” only “Mikey”. “Shamby” is not present at all in thestore.• As with Larry, Michele’s statement that Kinsey said she knew “Mikey” “fromMr. Gary’s house” is contradicted by the Hickey notes.• The description of “Mikey” as “wearing an Army suit” was again Michele’s, notKinsey’s.• My “famous” pointed eyebrows were of course visible to either adult in the PX,and were known to Larry per his statement of instantly recognizing me frommy assignment at the Presidio. [Evidently he had paid more attention to methan I had to him at the time.]• Kinsey never refers to anyone as “the blood man” in the Hickey notes.- 32 -• After recognizing me, Michele picks Kinsey up and asks her to “point ‘Mikey’out across the aisle of merchandise”. Michele of course would have had Kinseyfacing me, and the probability of more than one man in such close proximityas an aisle is low. [Nor, of course, did I notice any woman/child pointingfingers at me, which further speaks to Michele’s account as pure invention.]• Michele, apparently still carrying Kinsey, walks past me even closer, having aconversation about “Mikey”. I still do not notice any such two persons.• Michele is now looking so closely over my shoulder at the checkout stand thatshe can not only see my Army ID card but watch me sign “Michael A. Aquino”.Are we to believe that I would not notice, and object to, someone next to meexamining my financial transaction that intimately? Not to mention that mysignature is a series of loops and lines which do not individually-letter“Michael A. Aquino”.• The [still only] three A-Ts are now in their car. They drive near enough tothecar I am using for Kinsey to “recognize” Lilith as “Shamby”. As noted above,throughout the Hickey notes Kinsey never accused “Shambee” of anything; itwas only Michele who did.• Kinsey never said in the Hickey notes that “Mikey had put blood on her andhad licked it off and that he had put his penis on her.” Again this is originaltoMichele in this FBI statement.• As at least one adult A-T was in their car, as we drove straight to our houseafew blocks away to unload the microwave, it would have been easy for him/her/them to follow us and observe that our house was a gray building withsteps to its door. Once again the Hickey notes refute Kinsey’s actually sayingthis herself; indeed every mention she made of a house throughout thesessions contradicts all actual features of our house.Kinsey, whom her parents had now had 17 hours to privately coach and rehearsesince one or both of them had seen us at the PX, was also interviewed byForeman:- 33 -FD-302FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONDate of transcription 8/13/87[All sic] KINSEY ADAMS-THOMPSON, was interviewed by Bureau agent withparental permission at her residence. KINSEY is known to the interviewing agentandprovided the following information:She was shown a group of five photographs containing a photograph of GARYWILLARD HAMBRIGHT. She examined the photographs and pointed outHAMBRIGHT’s photo stating “Thats Mr. GARY”. KINSEY said that Mr. GARY hadplaced his penis into her bottom, vagina, and her mouth. Mr. GARY did this onmorethan one ocassion and that the first time it occurred was at her school. Sherecalledtraveling with Mr. GARY in a green car to his house where he took photographs ofher.Also present at the house were MIKEY and SHAMBY. KINSEY said that the house hadabathtub with lions feet and that she was taken to the residence on more than oneocassion. Once she recalled having Cheerios with brown sugar on them for lunch.KINSEY said that MIKEY wears army clothes like my daddies. MIKEY put his penisintoher mouth, bottom, and vagina just like Mr. GARY.MIKEY, and Mr. GARY would dress up in girls clothes and Mrs. SHAMBY wore boysclothes at Mr. GARY’s house. MIKEY and SHAMBY touched her private parts and Mr.GARY touched her private parts.Interviewing agent drew a stick figure of KINSEY which she was asked to circleonthe figure those areas where Mr. GARY had touched her. She first drew a blackcircleover the groin and chest area and a second circle over the mouth of the stickfigure. Asecond stick figure was drawn representing Mr. GARY. KINSEY was asked if she hadever seen Mr. GARY’S penis at which point she drew a line from one stick figureto theother indicating that Mr. GARY had a penis and that he had touched her with it.____________________________________________________Investigation on 8/13/87 at PRESIDIO OF SAN FRANCISCOFile # 70A-111158by SA CLYDE E. FOREMAN/mwtDate dictated 8/13/87Looking in detail at Kinsey’s statements to Foreman:• First, of course, what’s conspicuous for its absence? Any mention whateverof the purported PX encounter/”identification”. And this wassupposedly the central point of this recontact of the FBI. But Kinsey said not aword about seeing either of us, “identifying” either of us, or connecting uswith“Mikey and Shamby”. Nor did Foreman, supposedly there specifically to askher about that, ask her about that.• Kinsey states that on at least two occasions Gary Hambright inserted his penisinto her vagina and rectum, and that on at least one occasion “Mikey” did too.- 34 -This is refuted by the medical examination of Kinsey, which described both hervagina and her rectum as normal and free from any signs of rape.• Kinsey now states that she was taken to Hambright’s house on more than oneoccasion. During the 4/7/87 “play therapy” session, however, Hickey askedAlmond twice if she ever went anywhere with Hambright. Both times Almondsaid no. Only after Hickey still persisted asking the same question did Almondfinally change her answer to yes. And, again, Kinsey was always a randomdrop-off/pick-up child at the day-care center. There would have beenno time to take her anywhere else, particularly for such elaborate events as shestates here, if her parents might arrive at the center at any moment to pick herup. And, obviously, they always found her there unraped, unbruised, anduntraumatized. 53• Hambright was an epileptic who did not have a driver’s license nor own a car.• No photographs of Kinsey taken by Hambright were ever produced.• Our bathtub is a flush-to-the-floor model with no feet, obviously [by itswear]installed many years before 1986. Nowhere else in the building is there a“footed” bathtub either.• The “army clothes” statement was first introduced into the Hickey sessions byMichele, not Kinsey, on 6/30/87. Michele makes the same statement again inher 8/13/87 interview above, so she is obviously very dedicated to pushing it.• No female clothing of male size was found at our home when it was searchedthe following day, nor for that matter male clothing of female size. Presumablyno such items were ever found at Hambright’s residence either, otherwise wewould have heard about it.• Kinsey never said in the Hickey notes that “Shambee” touched her anywhere,including private parts.• The stick figure: Once again, in the only untainted [by Hickey’s “playtherapy”indoctrinating] FBI interview of 1/14/87, Kinsey denied that Hambright hadever even tried to touch her.• Kinsey’s “drawing a line from one stick figure to the other” being interpretedby Foreman as Hambright’s “touching her with his penis” speaks more forForeman’s mental predisposition than artwork per se.53 FBI FD-302 1/14/87, this chapter.- 35 -In summary the three A-T FBI interviews of 8/12&13/87 were a clumsy,transparent,factually- and mutually-contradictory failure for the parents and Foreman, andthat iswhy they were instantly buried and remained so throughout all of theinvestigations.But the efforts to manufacture some kind of “evidence” were not yet over for theday.Foreman and Michele were determined that Kinsey should “identify” our house astheone to which she had “been taken” [despite the aforementioned impossibility, andKinsey’s denial, of any such trip]. A CID agent, Bradley J. Potter, was takenalong towrite the official report.The media would be told that this excursion resulted in Kinsey’s“identification” ofour house, which for years would be held up as one of the most significant“proofs” ofour guilt. Once again both the existence and the actual contents of the Potterreportwere concealed from us until after all the investigations, leading me duringthatinterval to suppose only that A-T had simply followed us home from the PX on8/12/87and made enough notes about its location and appearance to be used in Michele’s8/13/87 interview and now this excursion.When finally obtained in 1991 in Aquino v Stone Discovery, the Potter reporttoldquite a different story. Here it is: [Note: Throughout this book the address ofour 1987San Francisco home is shown as “123 Acme Avenue” out of consideration for thecurrent residents at that address.]AGENT’S INVESTIGATION REPORTROI Number 0499-87-CID026CID Regulation 195-1Page 1 of 1 pages[All sic] BACKGROUND: This Agent’s Investigation Report is prepared inconjunctionwith the interview of Kinsey ADAMS-THOMPSON, conducted by SA Clyde FOREMAN,FBI, San Francisco, CA, which was conducted on 13 Aug 87.NARRATIVE:1. Interview of Victim:1.1 Kinsey Marie ADAMS-THOMPSON (D/SD OF CPT Larry P. ADAMS-THOMPSON;562-76-3492; formerly residing at 1431-D Battery Caulfied, Presidio of SanFranciscoCA 94129):On 13 Aug 87, Kinsey was interviewed by SA FOREMAN, at her residence. SAFOREMAN had been advised by Kinsey’s parents of an incident which occurred atthePresidio Main Post Exchange on 12 Aug 87. This incident involved Kinseyidentifying‘Mickie & Shambi’, (LTC & Mrs AQUINO), while inside the PX. SA FOREMANconducted the interview between 0900-0945, 13 Aug 87. After the interview wasconducted, SA FOREMAN advised SA POTTER that Kinsey stated she would be able to- 36 -locate the house where ‘Mr GARY’ had taken her. Kinsey, her mother, SA FOREMAN,and SA POTTER then departed Presidio, via the Lombard Gate, past the CDC. WhileonLombard Street, east bound, Kinsey was observed holding her right hand in amannerwhich had her thumb, index finger, and little finger extended, leaving themiddle andring fingers curled underneath. Kinsey, while holding her hand in this manner,stated toSA POTTER, ‘Mr GARY showed me how to do this’, or words to that effect. Kinseydidnot direct SA POTTER, who was driving, where to turn, or which route to take. SAPOTTER drove the the vicinity of the 100 block of Acme Avenue, San Fracisco, CAandparked the vehicle about 11/2 blocks south of the 100 block on Acme Avenue. MrsADAMS-THOMPSON, Kinsey, SA FOREMAN and SA POTTER then exited the vechicleand began walking in the neighborhood. While walking down Acme Avenue (north),onthe east side of the street, Kinsey appeared to show a behavioral change.Approximately10-15 feet before coming to the front of 123 Acme Avenue, Kinsey began to appearfrightened and wanted to be held by her mother. Kinsey was picked up by hermother,but continued to stare at the front of 123 Acme Avenue. It was observed thatfour mailboxes were located adjacent to the entrance to the residence. Kinsey was takenfurthernorth on Acme Avenue, then back on the west side of the street, where Kinseythenpicked out an automobile as belonging to, ‘Mickie and Shanbie’. The car wassubsequently identified as a red colored sedan that had been rented by/to LTCAQUINO. This information was verified by SA FOREMAN.///LAST ENTRY///Typed Agent’s Name and Sequence Number:BRADLEY J. POTTER, 2331Organization:Oakland Branch Office, Sixth Region,USACIDC, Oakland Army Base, CA 94626-5000/s/Robert R. Buik [sp?], 207313 Aug 87Passing over the oddity of why the CID Agent making this report didn’t sign ithimself, what do its details actually reveal?•Foreman’s statement to Potter that “Kinsey stated that she would be able tolocate the house where ‘Mr Gary’ had taken her” was not included in the recordof his interview with her that morning.•Potter drove straight from the Presidio to Acme Avenue. Kinsey was not shownany other block or neighborhood either previously or subsequently.•The hand sign (thumb, index, & little fingers extended) that Kinsey wasobserved making during the drive was presumably mentioned because Potter[or Michele A-T] assumed it to be the Satanic “Sign of the Horns”. It was not.It was rather the American Sign Language sign (invented for the deaf, but usedhabitually by many people) for “I love you”. It is frequently used by teachers,politicians, et al. ; and there is even a U.S. postage stamp dedicated to it.[The- 37 -Satanic Sign of the Horns has the thumb over the two lowered middle fingers.This is not what Kinsey was doing. Nor, it may be added, does the Temple ofSet use the Sign of the Horns, as it is regarded as an obsolete Church of Satan-era gesture only.]•Potter acknowledges that when leaving the Presidio, he received no guidancefrom Kinsey at all concerning what direction to take. So it was on Foreman’sinstructions that he went directly to Acme Avenue.•When led on foot to 123 Acme Avenue, Kinsey “appeared frightened andwanted to be held by her mother”. So Michele picked her up and held her rightin front of the building, so that Kinsey could “continue to stare at it”.Michelepicked up Kinsey and held her in front of no other building - just that one,which she knew was our address.•Despite this prompting from Michele, Kinsey said nothing whatever about thebuilding. She did not point at it, scream, turn away from it, or “identify” itinany way.•When taken back up the same block, Kinsey didn’t react at all when passing123. Evidently she and Michele were now uninterested in it, because theperformance” had been done.•Moreover it would have been impossible for Kinsey not to walk back right infront of 123, because there is no sidewalk on the other side of that block -just awall with cars parked next to it - and that block sees constant vehicle trafficinthe daytime.•The “car identification” was meaningless, because at least one of the adult A-Ts, and possibly Kinsey, had seen the rented red Isuzu at the PX on 8/12 andwritten down its license number.In summary, Kinsey made no house “identification” whatever, despite theguiding and prompting of her to do so at 123 Acme Avenue. Because of herparents’ignorance of actual Temple of Set symbolism, they also coached her to show theFBI/CID a “Satanic” hand gesture which we in fact do not use.So again it is obvious why this report was concealed, even to the extent ofofficiallydenying its existence.At this point Foreman referred Larry A-T to the San Francisco Police Department.He telephoned Sergeant-Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff and made an appointment forLarryto see him the following morning.At 9AM on 8/14/87 Larry A-T walked alone into Pamfiloff’s office and told himwhatthroughout all the subsequent investigations I referred to as his “packagestory”. It was- 38 -the story routinely quoted in the media for years [and still is on various crankandconspiracy Internet websites today]. Unlike the hushed-up FBI reports andinaccessibleHickey notes, Pamfiloff’s SFPD Incident Report was automatically a publicrecord.Because of both its significance and its publicity, the rest of this chapter isdevotedto it. I have annotated it to show the extent of Larry A-T’s deliberate lies intelling this“package story” to the SFPD:SFPD Incident Report(Annotated by Michael A.

It was refuted by the 3/12/87 medicalexamination report of Kinsey verifying that she was a virgin with “nophysical evidence of abuse”. This refutation, plus the contradictorystatements of the A-Ts in the 1/14/87 FBI interview, was not provided toPamfiloff by either Foreman or Larry A-T.Glenn Pamfiloff phoned Larry Adams-Thompson and an appt. was made with heand Kinsey Almond, Fri. 08/14/87–0900 at Juvenile Division.Larry Adams-Thompson stated that between the above dates and times, KinseyAlmond was dropped off at San Francisco Presidio Day Care Center approximatelyfour or five times.1.As Pamfiloff confirmed personally to me on 4/16/91, this meeting andconversation was exclusively between Larry A-T and himself, and that duringthe entire investigation he had never once talked with Kinsey at all.2.The “above dates and times” are September 1-October 31, 1986. Note thatLarry A-T was specific and exclusive about this window, just as he andMichele had been specific and exclusive to FBI SA Peyton on 1/14/87.The Aquinos were later verified to be in Washington, D.C. on all dates duringthis window on which Kinsey had been at the Presidio day-care center.3.In a 2/18/87 interview with FBI Agent Foreman, Hickey also stated that“during the month of September 1986 Kinsey was moved into an hourly daycare class under the direct care and control of Gary Hambright”, and that itwas specifically during this window that the wetting incidents (supposedlysymptomatic of the later-alleged “abuse”) occurred.4.When the CID later attempted to move the A-Ts’ allegations back severalmonths to June 1986 when the Aquinos were still living in San Francisco, inorder to “fit them to the allegations somehow”, the fact that the supposed“evidence” of the wetting incidents took place in September was simplyignored, despite the fact that one or both of these incidents supposedly“proved” that such a crime happened at all.Larry Adams-Thompson states that on two occasions when he picked up KinseyAlmond at the end of the day, he was informed by Gary Hambright that KinseyAlmond had wet her pants and Larry Adams-Thompson was provided with the soiledpanties, and on one occasion with soiled outer pants. This was unusual as KinseyAlmond had not wet herself in approximately a year. At this time, Kinsey Almondstarted having nightmares, and would wet herself when frightened.- 40 -1.There is no mention in their 1/14/87 FBI interview that either adult A-Tcomplained to the daycare staff about this wetting, or took Kinsey for anymedical examination because of it [or nightmares]. There is no mention thatany of the alleged nightmares had any sexual molestation themes to them, ormention that the A-Ts took Kinsey for any psychiatric examination becauseof them.2.Again with reference to the later attempts to backdate the A-T allegations: Inher 4/23/87 Sworn Affidavit, Hickey stated, and related both A-Ts as statingto her, that Kinsey’s attitude and behavior were completely normal priorto the September-October 1986 window.Larry Adams-Thompson states that in Jan. of 1987 he became aware a childmolest investigation involving Gary Hambright at the Presidio Day Care Center.1.The news of the Presidio allegations begun by the Tobins was announced byletter to all Presidio parents by Lt. Colonel Meyer, Presidio HQ, on December15, 1986 (Appendix #10).2.In the San Jose Mercury News West (11/24/88) it was stated that “OnThursday (11/20/86) Mike Tobin spoke with a chaplain at the Presidio, whocontacted the Army’s CID”. That chaplain was probably Larry A-T, becausethe Tobins’ and the A-Ts’ names appeared together on a later April 1987alarmist letter to other parents in furtherance of the Presidio scare.Kinsey Almond was questioned on 01/14/87 by an FBI Agent but made nodefinitive statements.1.Larry A-T lies to Pamfiloff. From Kinsey’s 1/14/87 FBI interview: “WhenMrs. Adams-Thompson asked if Mr. Gary had been mean to her or tried totouch her, Kinsey replied negatively.” That’s a very definite denial ofany abuse.Kinsey Almond was subsequently entered into child therapy in Feb. 1987 and afterfour visits, the therapist informed Larry Adams-Thompson that Kinsey Almond haddisclosed being molested.1.Larry A-T lies to Pamfiloff. Per Hickey’s 2/18/87 statement to Foreman, theA-Ts entered Kinsey into therapy with her on January 13, 1987 (the daybefore the initial FBI interview containing Kinsey’s denial of any abuse).- 41 -2.Assuming from the Hickey transcripts that were obtained in 1991 underlawsuit Discovery that the Kinsey sessions were weekly, the fourth sessionwould have been 2/3/87. The notes for that session [from Appendix #12]:I asked her if Mr. Gary was a bad man - she said “no, that Mr. Gary loves meand scares me”. I asked her how Mr. Gary loves her. She replied that he “hugsme & never spanks me”. I asked if Mr. Gary did anything else to love her. She"},{"pageContent":"replied, “No.” I asked if Mr. Gary kissed her. She replied, “No, but other kidskissed Mr. Gary and blow Mr. Gary in a yucky way.” I asked her how, and shesaid, “Mr. Gary touched” in a “naked place”. Asked her to show me where. Shepointed to her genital region. Then said, “Mr. Gary goes pee-pee on a boy’sshoe,” and spontaneously said Mr. Gary had a “penis” which she said was “soft”and his did too. Said kids touched Mr. Gary’s penis. When I asked how, shereplied, “Like my thumb,” and placed her thumb in her mouth and began tosuck on it. I asked her if his penis was hard or soft. She said it was “hard”andthen Mr. Gary went pee-pee” and kids would “get sick and throw up”. I askedher if Mr. Gary ever did this to her, and she said, “Yes, it tasted yucky - thepee-pee and it went on my shoes.” I asked if she had done this to anyone else, andshe said the “little girls did this to the little boys”, but could not/would nottellme any names. I asked if Mr. Gary ever took his clothes off, and she said,“Yes.”I asked if he took his shirt off, and she said, “Yes, and even showed us hisboobs.” I asked if she had ever taken her clothes off, and she said, “Yes.” Iaskedher if Mr. Gary had ever touched her, and she said, “Yes, in my naked part,” andsaid he had “spanked” her, pointing to doll’s buttocks. I asked her if he hadevertouched her anywhere else, and she said, “Yes,” and pointed to her vaginal areaand said, “On my penis. He put hot water on my penis. Don’t tell my dad.”Session began to end there. I asked her two or three more times if anyone elsehad ever done this, and she said, “No.” I asked her 2-3 times if she ever playedthis game with anyone else, and she kept replying, “Mr. Gary.” Session endedwith patient telling me we shouldn’t talk to anyone else about this. Patientwanted to continue to wash doll’s hair, and placed doll beside the sink to letitshair dry. Patient wanted to be picked up and carried back to waiting room,which I did. Told her I would see her next week.Obviously this session was completely inconsistent and incoherent; it isabsurd that it could be used to “diagnose sexual abuse”. Kinsey says that “Mr.Gary” doesn’t spank her and then that he does. She states that only “otherkids” performed fellatio on him, then states that she did. She said that he had“boobs”. She said that she has a penis and that he put hot water on it. Thereis of course no mention in the A-Ts’ 1/14/87 FBI interview that Kinsey everwas picked up at the day-care center in September-October 1986 making anymention or showing any signs of such shocking activity as fellatio or genitalscalding, nor that prior to the Tobins’ November 1986 allegations that anyother child mentioned or showed any signs of such activity to parents.- 42 -3.As Pamfiloff does not mention these inconsistencies, or the actual contents ofthe Hickey notes at all, in his report, it is apparent that Larry A-T concealedit from him, as it would clearly refute his account.During the next few visits Kinsey Almond told Larry Adams-Thompson that shehad been molested by Gary Hambright and a “Mikey” and a “Shamby”, whoseidentities were unknown.1.There is no mention in the Hickey notes of Larry A-T ever being present atany of the sessions.2.In six months of sessions, from January through June 1987, Kinsey nevermentions a “Mikey” at all. Rather it is her mother Michele who firstintroduces this name, and the allegation of “Mikey” as a molester, to Hickeyand Kinsey in the 6/30/87 session. Michele also introduced the “Armyofficer” association during this session.3.“Shambee” (Hickey’s spelling) appeared first on 1/27/87, introduced byKinsey as “her friend at school” who was spanked by Mr. Rogers on TV.Kinsey added that Shambee “also had its neck broken”, indicating that“Shambee” is either an imaginary “friend” or perhaps a doll. “Shambee” wasreintroduced as “Mikey’s wife” by Michele on 6/30/87. Kinsey never allegedany abuse, or participation in abuse by “Shambee”, at any time.4.Therefore Larry A-T lied to Pamfiloff in every element of this statement. Justas obviously, he and Michele already had their “Army officer ‘Mikey’” and hiswife selected for their “Satanic ritual abuse” scam, as Michele’s introductionof “Satanic cults” to Hickey during the 6/2/87 session further evidences.On Wed. 08/12/87 Larry Adams-Thompson, Michele Adams-Thompson andKinsey Almond were at the Presidio PX when Kinsey Almond ran to Larry Adams-Thompson and in a frightened way, clutched his leg. Larry Adams-Thompson at thistime looked up and saw Michael Aquino whom he knew to be Michael Aquino;Michael Aquino was wearing a white shirt, and Larry Adams-Thompson askedKinsey Almond if she knew the man in the white shirt. Kinsey Almond looked upbutdidn’t respond. Larry Adams-Thompson called over Michele Adams-Thompson andagain Kinsey Almond was asked if she knew Michael Aquino. At this time KinseyAlmond said “Yes, that’s Mikey.” Larry A-T then took Kinsey Almond outside totheircar. Kinsey Almond then added “He’s a bad man and I’m afraid.” Michele Adams-Thompson then exited and Larry Adams-Thompson drove around to the other side ofthe PX. At this time Larry Adams-Thompson saw Lilith Aquino, who he knew to bethewife of Michael Aquino. Larry Adams-Thompson asked Kinsey Almond if she knewLilith Aquino, at which time she responded, “Yes, that’s Shamby.” Larry Adams-- 43 -Thompson, Michele Adams-Thompson, and Kinsey Almond went home and calledClyde Foreman.1.There is only the word of the two adult A-Ts that this incident ever happenedat all. All that is known for certain is that Larry and/or Michele werepresent and saw us at the PX on that day. Larry’s original 8/12/87 statementto the FBI did not mention Michele as being present. She added herself inher statement on 8/13/87. Kinsey’s original 8/13/87 statement to the FBImade no mention of any such incident at all.2. 1-1/2 years later the A-Ts, apparently in a belated effort to support theirstoryconcerning the PX, suddenly added Larry’s two sons to the scene. Also just assuddenly these two boys echoed their father’s story to the CID. A younger A-T daughter was added to the scene as well. From the original two A-Ts (Larryand Kinsey, if we suppose that he did not invent her presence as well), we arenow up to six. Throughout the FBI and SFPD investigations, Kinsey neveronce stated or agreed to in any official record either her presence at the PX orany of the statements or actions attributed to her there. Only 1-1/2 yearslater, in an obviously coached [and clumsily performed] interview with theCID did she make any reference to the PX, purportedly saying that she hadrecognized me but not Mrs. Aquino there.Following is a detailed examination of the adult A-Ts’ PX allegations:3. On 8/14/87 Larry told Pamfiloff that “on 12 August 1987 he, Michele, andKinsey were at the Presidio PX”. No mention is made of any other membersof the Adams or Thompson family together with them at the PX. In Larry’s8/12/87 FBI interview he made no mention of Michele’s presence at all.4. On 8/13/87 Michele stated to Foreman that only she, Kinsey, and herhusband were shopping at the PX. No mention is made of any othermembers of the Adams or Thompson family together with them at the PX.5. No mention was made of any other family members present throughout thesubsequent 1-1/2 years while the Aquinos were being investigated and the PXaccount described in detail in the public media. Only when the CIDinterviewed Larry 1–1/2 years later on 4/10/89 did he again revise his storyto say that two sons of his by a previous marriage and another girl (“ouryoungest daughter”) were also there.6. In the 8/14/87 SFPD incident report Larry told Pamfiloff that, at the PX,Kinsey “ran to him and in a frightened way clutched his leg”.- 44 -7. In the 8/13/87 FBI report Michele told Foreman that, at the PX, “Kinsey ranto her and Larry”. In her 4/10/89 CID statement, however, she contradictsthis, saying that Larry called Michele over to him after Kinsey was alreadywith him.8. On 4/10/89 Larry told the 6RCID that Kinsey was with her two stepbrothersin the PX, away from him and his wife, and that it was the two boys whobrought Kinsey to him “saying Kinsey was acting weird”. He did not say thatKinsey “ran to him”. He also said that Michele was “in another area of thestore” and that he had to go to her in that area when Kinsey was brought tohim [alone].Hence Larry lied when making one of his two mutually-contradictory statements.Michele also lied when making one of her two mutually-contradictorystatements. [If in fact Kinsey did not “react” at all in the PX, or was not eventhere, as is also possible, then of course Larry lied when making bothstatements.] Furthermore, where would Kinsey “run from”? Did the A-Ts allow a3-year-old infant to wander around the PX away from them? How could Kinseyrun “to [Michele] and Larry” when they were in different parts of the store?9. The two boys (who in August 87 were approximately 9 and 13 years old),interviewed 1-1/2 years later by the 6RCID, state that Kinsey was with themand that she reacted as alleged in the account Larry gave to the 6RCID [butnot to the FBI or SFPD].a. Why are the memories of two children at such ages suddenly so preciseconcerning what to them would have been only a momentary behavior bytheir infant stepsister 1-1/2 years previously?b. Why were these boys not mentioned by or interviewed by Foreman orPamfiloff at the time? They are not listed on page #1 of the SFPD incidentreport. They are not mentioned in Galyean’s 8/12/87 or Foreman’s8/13/87 reports. [The FBI knew of their existence, however, as they wereidentified as relatives in Peyton’s 1/14/87 report.] They would have beencrucial witnesses to the “PX encounter”. And why were they notmentioned by any of the news media in their intense and detailedcoverage of the allegations over the next 1-1/2 years?The boys’ story is obviously a later invention, coached into them by the adultA-Ts. Presumably the boys’ motivation in reciting this story is to try to shieldtheirfather from exposure of his lies in this affair.- 45 -10. On 8/14/87 Larry told Pamfiloff that he called Kinsey’s attention to me -notonce, but twice - and asked her if she knew me before eliciting a “Yes, that’sMikey” response.11. On 8/12/87, however, Larry told Galyean not that he had called Kinsey’sattention to me, but that she had, only once, identified both me and Lilith, inthe PX “as ‘Mikey’ and ‘Shamby’”.12. On 8/13/87 Michele told Foreman that Kinsey “told them that she had seen aman named ‘Mikey’ that she knew from Mr. Gary’s house”. Now the suddenaddition of “Mr. Gary’s house”.13. On 4/10/89 Larry told the CID that Kinsey twice made no answer inresponse to his twice-stated question: “Do you know that man?”. Then hetold the CID that Michele took Kinsey away from him and over to my vicinityfor about five minutes. Then he said that Michele came back and that theyproceeded to leave the PX. As they were doing so, he said “I heard Kinseystate ‘That’s Mikey, he’s a bad man, get me out of this place’ or words to thateffect.”Larry gave one version of Kinsey’s alleged statement in the PX to the SFPD andanother version to the CID. In both instances he admits to prompting Kinseyrepeatedly for an “identification”. Both of his stories contradict the accountgivenby Michele to Foreman only one day before his statement to the SFPD, as well asLarry’s given to Galyean two days before.14. On 8/14/87 Larry told Pamfiloff only that Kinsey “saw” me.15. On 8/12/87 Larry told Galyean that I “made eye contact with Kinsey”. [I didnot, and would not have recognized her if I had.]16. In her 8/13/87 statement to Foreman, Michele says nothing whatever aboutKinsey making eye contact with me.Larry thus gave two contradictory accounts one day apart [and immediately afterthe PX incident]. Furthermore, Larry told the CID 1-1/2 years later that it wasthetwo boys who were with Kinsey when she noticed me. Larry lied in the initialcontradiction, and then again if he now states that Kinsey was with the two boysat the time.17. To Pamfiloff on 8/14/87 and to the CID on 4/10/89, Larry said that he andKinsey saw only me in the PX, and that Lilith did not appear until later in theparking lot.- 46 -18. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Michele said nothing about Lilith being in the PX,and that her first appearance was “standing next to the car in the parkinglot”. Michele further said that she “followed Colonel Aquino to the checkoutstand” closely enough to observe my active-duty Army ID card and to see mesign my full name on the MasterCard slip. As Lilith was standing with me inthe checkout line, it would have been quite impossible for Michele not to seeher if she were peering over my shoulder at the time.19. To the CID on 4/10/89 Michele A-T said that Lilith was in the PX, that sheobserved us purchase the microwave together in the checkout line, and thatshe watched us exit together through the PX mall area. [In this interview shetried to cover up for her earlier failure to mention Lilith in the PX byimplying that she didn’t recognize her as my wife. In Larry’s 8/12/87telephone call to Galyean, however, he said that he recognized Lilith becauseshe had been introduced at several Presidio functions. Presumably Micheleattended those same husband/wife “command performance” social functionswith her husband, so she had no excuse for not recognizing the woman withme in the PX as that same Mrs. Aquino. [Lilith possesses very striking anddistinctive looks.]Lilith was with me at all times in the PX; therefore Larry’s 1987/1989 andMichele’s 1987 statements that she didn’t appear until later in the parking lotareobvious lies - and among the more conspicuous lies in the A-Ts’ originalallegations. In her 1989 statement to the CID, Michele completely contradictedher original 1987 statement to Foreman on this matter.20. To Pamfiloff Larry said that he [alone] took Kinsey “outside to their car”.Hemade no mention of taking the younger girl or the two boys out to the car.Why would he take Kinsey outside to the car at all if she had already“identified” someone whom Larry himself stated in the SFPD report that herecognized? As it was obvious that Lilith and I were leaving the PX, and if thegoal was to calm Kinsey, why suddenly rush all of the A-Ts out into their car?Why would they not be accompanied by Kinsey’s mother, who wouldpresumably have been greatly concerned about her daughter? Neither Larrynor Michele explains this.Obviously the A-Ts, who had already seen and recognized both Lilith and myselfin the PX, wanted to see what our car looked like so that it could be added totheallegations they had already planned to make against us. Once in their own car,they followed us to our home, so that Michele could allude to Kinsey’sdescribingits front the next day to the FBI, and try to pre-coach Kinsey into“recognizing”that as well before an FBI audience to which she “volunteered” the next day.They- 47 -succeeded in coaching Kinsey to “recognize” the car (which they didn’t know wasonly a rental car) and failed with the house.21. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Larry said that he “went to the car to wait for us,andsaw them, and took the license number”.22. To Pamfiloff on 8/14/87 Larry said that he drove around to the other side ofthe PX, where Kinsey supposedly identified Lilith as “Shamby”. In this SFPDversion there is no mention of our car or taking its license number.Larry changes his story at will, as in one case he needed to drive to the otherlotto find us, while in the other he merely waits for us.23. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Michele said that “Michele, Larry, and Kinsey drovethrough the parking lot where they observed Colonel Aquino standing next toa red vehicle with California license plate 2ENS453. This vehicle was a 1987Isuzu. Kinsey observed a woman standing next to the vehicle and said,‘That’s Shamby.’” [In this account Michele identified herself, her husband,and Kinsey by name but made no mention whatever of the two boys andadditional girl who were suddenly introduced into this story 1-1/2 yearslater.]24. In her 4/10/89 CID statement, Michele said that Lilith was standing next toour car “alone”.Michele changes her story at will concerning how many Aquinos were standingnext to the Isuzu.25. To the SFPD on 8/14/87 Larry said that he drove around to the other side ofthe PX. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Michele said that he drove through theparking lot to our car.In one version Larry drives around to the other side of the PX, while in theotherhe merely waits for us, sees us, and takes down the license number of our car.26. If Kinsey had already seen Lilith and myself in the PX, as Larry admitted tothe CID on 4/10/89, why would Kinsey not have “identified” Lilith until laterat our car?27. One could not reach the bridge-approach parking lot by driving “through themain lot” in 1987; it was necessary to drive out into the street and about 2blocks to the east to circle around the complex, or about 2 blocks to the west- 48 -to circle around it from the other side. [Barriers to a shorter route wereremoved following the Army’s closure of the Presidio in the 1990s.]28. The PX has two parking lots, one on the north side of the mall and one onthesouth side of the mall. From the A-Ts’ 4/10/89 CID statements, their car wasparked in the north lot. Our car was parked in the south lot. If the A-Ts drovearound to the south lot from the north lot after seeing us go through the mall,and if Michele (per her 4/10/89 statement) didn’t even get into the A-T caruntil after we had walked through the mall doors to the south lot, theywouldn’t have had time to get there [for the alleged Kinsey “identification” ofLilith] before we drove away. It was approximately a 2-blocks up/2-blocksback drive between the two lots, no matter which direction they might havegone.Larry is lying about being able to “drive around to the other side of the PX”forKinsey to see Lilith and for him to take down the license number of our car. Ittook so long to drive to the “bridge-approach” lot from the main lot that wewould have driven away before Larry could get to that area, much less single outour car from among the others there, much less identify us inside a car. As itwasAugust and the car was air-conditioned, and we habitually drive with the A/C onand all windows up, is Kinsey supposed to have “identified” Lilith at adistance,from inside a moving car, looking at a car suddenly pointed out to her, and at aperson through rolled-up window glass? [Note: This car was a rental car whichLarry would never have seen before.] Probably the A-Ts simply followed us onfoot from the checkout counter through the mall doors to our rental car, thenwent to their own car [in either lot] and drove after us when we emerged fromthesouth lot.If Kinsey is supposed to have “identified” Lilith at a moment’s notice, at adistance, from inside a moving car, looking at a car suddenly pointed out toher,and at a person through rolled-up window glass, then why did she not “identify”Lilith in the PX, when she would have been able to look at her as long and asclosely as she allegedly did at me? Lilith was right next to me the entire timewewere in the PX. It would have been impossible for Kinsey [or the adult A-Ts] tosee just me and not Lilith.On Thu. 08/13/87 morning Clyde Foreman interviewed Kinsey Almond, whostated that Gary Hambright, “Mr. Gary” whom she identified from a photo spread,had placed his penis into her bottom, vagina and mouth. Kinsey Almond statesthatshe drove with Mr. Gary to his house where Gary Hambright took photographs ofher. Michael Aquino “Mikey” and Lilith Aquino “Shamby” were present and MichaelAquino also put his penis into her mouth, bottom and vagina, just like Mr. Gary.- 49 -Kinsey Almond stated that Michael Aquino and Gary Hambright dressed up in girlsclothing and Lilith Aquino dressed up in boys clothing.1.At no time during her interview with Foreman did Kinsey use the names of,or describe or identify in any way, either Michael or Lilith Aquino. Larry’sassociation of the “Mikey” and “Shamby” devices of his scam-story to theAquinos is completely unsubstantiated by the Foreman-Kinsey interviewrecord.2.While Kinsey was apparently shown a photograph of Hambright during herForeman interview, she was not shown any photos of the Aquinos - which,through their Army ID card or California driver’s license records, would havebeen easy to obtain.3.Hambright was later established to be an epileptic who could not drive, hadno license, and had no car.4.On 3/12/87 Kinsey Almond was medically examined, including both hervagina and rectum, at Letterman Army Hospital. The findings of this medicalexamination stated specifically that there was “no physical evidence ofabuse”.5.Kinsey’s imitation of Larry and Michele’s scam-story to Foreman iscompletely unsubstantiated by the notes of any of the Hickey sessions.6.No such “photographs” of Kinsey at the Aquino home ever existed, and thuswere not found either during the search of our home or anywhere else.7.No female clothing of a size which Michael could conceivably wear, or maleclothing which Lilith could conceivably wear, existed, and thus was not foundduring the search of our home.Kinsey Almond states the house had a bathtub with lions feet.1.Nowhere in the Aquino building at 123 Acme Avenue did [or does] there exista bathtub with any feet, as the search verified. All the tubs have bases flushwith the floors of the bathrooms.Clyde Foreman and Kinsey Almond accompanied by Michele Adams-Thompsonresponded to the 100 block of Acme and Kinsey Almond was told to see if shecouldrecognize any of the homes that she had been to before. While walking past 123Acme,Kinsey Almond identified that as the residence of Mr. Gary where she had met“Mikey” and “Shamby”.- 50 -1. The 8/13/87 record of this trip by CID Special Agent Bradley Potter revealsthat virtually every element of Larry’s statement to Pamfiloff concerning itwas a lie. As discussed in detail in the above analysis of the Potter report,Kinsey made no “identification” of 123 Acme at all, said nothing about “Mr.Gary”, and said nothing about “Mikey” or “Shamby”.During the ensuing publicity, in which much was made of the alleged“identification” of our building, Larry remained silent about the fact that nosuch“identification” ever happened.Clyde Foreman confirmed that Michael Aquino is listed on the mail box, and thelocal mail carrier advised Clyde Foreman that Michael Aquino is still receivingmailat 123 Acme. Pacific Bell shows Michael Aquino having the entire upper floor,Apt 1,Apt 2 + rear unit. Glenn Pamfiloff confirmed with PG&E that Michael Aquino islistedas receiving service at 123 Acme top and base. Michael Aquino’s DMV records alsolisthis residence as 123 Acme.On Fri. 08/14/87, Clyde Foreman re-interviewed Kinsey Almond who stated shewas filmed with a movie camera with steady lights while she bathed in a plasticlionbathtub. Kinsey Almond states the living room had black walls and a crosspainted onthe ceiling.1.While I was eventually able to obtain all the other FBI interview reports citedhere, no copy of a report of any 8/14/87 interview by Foreman of Kinsey, orof any other Foreman/Kinsey interview besides the 8/13/87 one, has everappeared, or was produced in the Army investigation, etc. There is onlyLarry’s word to Pamfiloff that Kinsey said any of these things either toForeman or anyone else. Judging by the extent of Larry’s lies to Pamfiloffthroughout their 8/14/87 interview, this final “hearsay” deserves nocredibility whatever. Nevertheless:2.On 8/13/87 Kinsey said to Foreman that “the house had a bathtub with lionsfeet”. She said nothing about a “plastic lion bathtub”, bathing, a moviecamera, steady lights, or a living room with black walls and a cross paintedon the ceiling.3.As noted above, no bathtubs at 123 Acme had/have any feet. All were/areflush to the floor.4.Obviously no movie camera, no movie-camera lights, and no “plastic lionbathtub” existed, and thus was not found during the search of our home. Norany film of Kinsey [or any other child] in our home.- 51 -5.Our living room was beige with a beige ceiling and had/has no cross paintedon the ceiling. Nor did/does any other room have a cross on the ceiling. [Veryobviously Lilith and I are not Christians - why would we decorate anything inour home with a cross?]6.The only black room in our home was the bedroom, which was so small thatthere is no room for any chairs, etc. in it besides the [queen-size] bed. Itcould not possibly be mistaken for a “living room”.7.The Hickey notes do not mention anything like this either. [In the 6/2/87session Hickey reports Kinsey as describing “a pot hanging down from theceiling with legs, arms, and a penis which went pee on her shoes”. PerhapsLarry and Michele thought that a little elaborate for their scam story, hencedecided to try a cross instead?]* * * * * * * * * *On the basis of this Incident Report, Pamfiloff sought and obtained the searchwarrant for our home reproduced here as Appendix #14. Interestingly, when Ispokewith him in 1991, Pamfiloff said that it was originally the Army CID and the FBIwhowanted a search warrant, but that the U.S. Attorney “wouldn’t touch it”. Onlythen didthey turn to the SFPD and ask Pamfiloff to obtain one from the districtattorney, whichhe did. “They were in a great hurry,” he remarked. 54Implications of Information Presented in this ChapterLarry and Michele knew that Kinsey had never shown any physical, verbal, oremotional signs of abuse to them while in Hambright’s day-care supervision. Theyknew she had not been under his supervision at all until September-October 1986,andthen only in an unscheduled, unannounced drop-off/pick-up setting in which therewasobviously neither time nor opportunity to transport any child or childrenelsewhere forelaborate activities such as Larry would later allege to the SFPD.Larry and Michele knew that Kinsey had been examined by Letterman Hospital andverified to be a virgin with no physical signs of any abuse.Larry and Michele knew that Hickey’s 2/3/87 “diagnosis of abuse” was bothcontradicted by the above facts and incoherent, inconsistent, and nonsensical onitsface.Larry and Michele knew my name and appearance from my assignment to thePresidio up to June 1986. They knew I was a “Satanist” but knew nothing abouttheactual and diametric distinctions between Satanism and the Temple of Set [towhich we54 Conversation, M.A. Aquino & Glenn Pamfiloff, Ellis Brooks Car Dealership, SanFrancisco, 8/16/91.- 52 -belonged since 1975]. Michele lay the groundwork for fabricating an accusationagainstme by introducing “Mikey, a Satanist Army officer” to Hickey on 6/30/87.Larry and/or Michele happened to see Lilith and myself in the Presidio PX on8/12/87. He/she/they secretly followed us to our home by car, so that Michelecoulddescribe its outside appearance [attributing it to Kinsey] to the FBI the nextday. Fromthe Hickey notes the A-Ts knew that Kinsey had denied ever being taken to ahouseuntil badgered into agreeing, that she had then denied it was Hambright’s house,andhad denied that Hambright was there, and had never mentioned “Mikey” or “Shamby”as being there.The numerous, different, and mutating versions of the “PX encounter” expose itas afabricated story by the adult A-Ts.The CID driver was told by Foreman and Michele where to go for the “houseidentification”. No other neighborhood was shown to Kinsey either beforehand orsubsequently. She was walked in no other direction. When she neared 123 Acme,hermother picked her up, stopped, and held her facing only that house. DespiteKinsey’sstill saying nothing whatever, this was held to be an “identification”. Duringthe drive,Kinsey showed Foreman and Potter a hand-gesture which Larry and Michele wouldmistakenly think “Satanic” and also mistakenly assume that “Satanists like us”woulduse. Hence their coaching of Kinsey to “spontaneously” show it to theinvestigators.Finally, Larry gave an extensive, detailed, and deliberately falsified statementto theSan Francisco Police Department, fully expecting that we would be victimized onitsbasis. This was to result in years of serious damage to us, both official and inthe media,about which the A-Ts never expressed any concern or remorse whatever.When the CID, in an effort to somehow make the A-T allegations “stick”, went sofaras to change first the date and then the location of the “abuse” back severalmonths to atime when the A-Ts knew Kinsey had never been in Hambright’s care, and again [asadrop-off child] could not have been taken miles away into San Francisco for astay at ahouse, they remained silent and cooperative with the CID’s attempted manufactureof“evidence”.On 3/15/88 the A-Ts filed fraudulent claims for $3 million based on theirknowinglyand deliberately false allegations. On the claims form they stated that Kinsey“wassexually abused, sodomized, and subjected to mental and emotional abuse. She hassuffered severe emotional and psychological stress and physical pain and willrequirelong-term therapy”.55In addition to constituting false statements to law-enforcement officers, LarryA-T’sstatements to officials investing a possible crime on an Army post, concerninganotherArmy officer, to the Army CID concerning all aspects of his allegations, and tothe U.S.Army Claims Service constitute numerous violations of Article 133, Uniform CodeofMilitary Justice, pertaining to the making of false official statements.Larry’s participation in the filing of the false claims is further in violationof Article133.55 Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death, Larry and Michele Adams-Thompson forKinsey, 3/15/88.- 53 -In the 27 years since Larry and Michele committed these actions, they have neveracknowledged, apologized for, or ever been held accountable for them.Summarily: The only abuse that Kinsey Almond suffered at the Presidio of SanFrancisco was by her own stepfather and mother.The Results of the Adams-Thompsons’ ClaimUntil July 2008 I never knew the outcome of the A-Ts’ $3 million claim. Thatyear,however, a Probate Court Opinion was published on the Internet (Appendix #76).Thestory that it told was that the Army had denied their claim, whereupon theyfiled suitagainst it in California court. The Army agreed to a settlement of $334,720, ofwhichhalf went directly to Larry and Michele, and the other half into a trust forKinsey,controlled by Larry and Michele until Kinsey’s 18th birthday. One month afterthatdate, unless Kinsey signed the trust as a new co-trustee, her half of the claimwould goto Larry and Michele.At age 13 Kinsey left Larry and Michele and went to live with her biologicalfather.The A-Ts’ lawyer sent her father’s lawyer a letter denying a copy of the trust.28 daysafter Kinsey’s 18th birthday, the A-Ts sued her to force her acceptance of itscontinuation [presumably under their control]. If the trust continued, Kinseywould notget personal control of it until she reached age 50. If she did not accept thisdemand, allof the trust money would be immediately paid to the A-Ts.Kinsey filed a counterclaim against the A-Ts’ attorney for aiding and abettingtheirbreach of their fiduciary duties. She prevailed in court, the trust wasdissolved, andKinsey received approximately $260,000 damages.From these events the following conclusions may be induced:(1)The Army did not award the A-Ts their hoped-for $3 million. It awardedthem nothing. Had the Army really believed that Kinsey had been abducted,raped, and sodomized [by anyone] while in Army care, I think it isreasonable to presume that the $3 million would have been paid withoutquestion.(2)The A-Ts, possibly counting on the scam’s publicity and the Army’sdiscomfort over the entire affair to work to their advantage, tried a suit inCalifornia court for their money. All that they got was a negotiatedsettlement of just $334,720.(3)The A-Ts, as trustees, controlled Kinsey’s half of the $334,720. When sheturned 18, they attempted to continue controlling it, by forcing her to accepta minority co-trusteeship which would prevent her from receiving anyremaining funds from her half until she was 50 years old. If she did notagree, the A-Ts would take all of it for themselves immediately.- 54 -I suggest that the true, financial motivation of Larry and Michele A-T indevisingtheir 1987 allegation scheme has been prima facie substantiated here - even tothefinal, and perhaps unsurprising, obscenity of their attempting to deny Kinseyherselfany part of the take from the scam in which they had used her so cruelly andcold-bloodedly as their pawn.- 55 -Chapter 3: The Cult Crusade of Sandi GallantIn order to understand the attitude of the San Francisco Police Department whenthe CID and FBI requested its involvement in the A-T allegations investigation,it isfirst necessary to discuss the influence of SFPD Policewoman Sandra “Sandi”Gallant( née Daly).An officer assigned to the SFPD’s Intelligence Division in the 1980s, Gallant atsomepoint either decided on her own or was assigned to specialize in “occult crime”,In theearly, pre- Michelle Remembers years of the decade, this was pretty much of ablankpage in law enforcement circles. Crimes were crimes, and if an occasionalperpetrator -like San Francisco’s infamous “Zodiac” serial-killer of the 1960s - toyed withastrological or “witchy” symbols, such were regarded as mere attention-gettingaccents.With no actual occult crime to investigate in San Francisco, Daly compensated byinvestigating occultism generally, of which San Francisco has always had acolorfulabundance. Wicca and similar “white-light” New Ageism weren’t of much interesttoher. The most deliciously “sinister” organization was the mysterious successorto thecity’s campy Church of Satan - the Temple of Set.Although since its 1975 founding the Temple had declined publicity as a matterofpolicy - it wished to avoid the “media circus” atmosphere that had constantlydoggedthe Church of Satan - its principles and activities had never been a secret fromanyonewith a reasonable or official need to know. 56 Officer Daly would have beenquitewelcome to meet with Temple officials, receive copies of our philosophical andceremonial papers, and/or attend activities had she made any such requests inherofficial capacity. 57 Evidently, however, she felt that “intelligence” was notreally“intelligence” unless it were clandestine. So at no time did she ever contactthe Templeof Set or myself for information concerning us.Nevertheless by 1981 Daly felt she knew enough about the ominous Temple of Setand its insidious leader to write a report to the SFPD about them. Here it is:56 For instance, detailed descriptions of the Temple’s beliefs, organization,and religious ceremonieswere provided to the Internal Revenue Service in 1975 as part of the [approved]application for officialrecognition as a church.57 Over the decades since its founding, the Temple of Set and its individualofficials have periodicallybeen contacted for advice on occult symbolism, other organizations, etc. by lawenforcement agenciesnationwide, for example Detective Frank Metoyer of the Los Angeles PoliceDepartment’s GangDivision. This has also included participation in panels, lecture presentations,etc. such as an “OccultCrime” seminar for southern states law enforcement agencies in 1989 hosted bythe Killeen, TexasPolice Department. Presumably because of Gallant’s activities and influence, theSFPD was oneagency that did not contact the Temple for such advice or consultation.- 56 -SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENTINTRA-DEPARTMENTAL MEMORANDUMIntelligence DivisionDay & Date: Tue., 07/07/81TO:SUBJECT:Captain Daniel J. MurphyTemple of SetCommanding OfficerIntelligence DivisionSir:Approximately two weeks ago, information was received that a Satanic Cult namedtheTemple of Set would be holding a black mass in the San Francisco Fisherman’sWharfarea. 58 The following background information has been obtained on this cult:HISTORYThe Temple of Set is a satanic group under the leadership of one Michael A.Aquino. 59 Itis a splinter group of the Church of Satan. They separated from LaVey’sorganization in1975. There are several hundred members and it operates on a National level.UnderAquino’s leadership are a council of nine lieutenants. 60The Temple of Set is seemingly obsessed with the military. 61 They have afascinationwith the Nazi movement, with many of them wearing, on occasion, World War IIGerman uniforms and insignia. 62 A more sinister aspect of their militaryfascination isthe fact that Aquino holds a commission as a Major in the United States ArmyReserve,58 False. The Temple of Set has never conducted a Black Mass (more accuratelythe Missa Solemnis, asatire of the Catholic Mass, at any of its activities. Such a ritual would beperformed only for anindividual member’s benefit, as a “disintoxication” from prior religiousindoctrination andintimidation. See Appendix #14.59 As above, the Temple of Set is not a “Satanic” organization or religion,since it considers all Judæo-Christian mythology, including “Satan”, as inaccurate and irrelevant.60 False. The Council of Nine is the Temple of Set’s corporate board ofdirectors, to which the HighPriest is responsible as corporate president, not the other way around.61 False. The Temple has no interest in or involvement with the military. Therehave been no sucharticles in its publications nor books on its reading list. Daly’s sole basisfor this claim seems to be thatthree members out of the Temple’s hundreds happen to also be members of the U.S.Army Reserve.62 False. The Temple has never held any activity in which German military orNazi uniforms orinsignia were worn or displayed. The reason is again, quite simply, that theSetian philosophy ofindividualism is completely incompatible with fascist principles ofstate-consciousness.- 57 -with his specialty being Military Intelligence. 63 He purports to his membersthat hereports directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, although this is probably a grossexageration(sic). 64 It is a fact, however, that he holds a Major’s commission and deals inthe area ofMilitary Intelligence. One of the organization’s lieutenants, a female namedWillieBrowning, allegedly is a Captain in the United States Army Reserve and in anIntelligence Unit in Los Angeles. Another lieutenant, Dennis Mann, is also aReserveofficer involved in Intelligence activities. 65LEADERSHIPThe following background information has been obtained on Michael Aquino.Subject isa WMA, DOB 10/16/46, currently residing at 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco. (TheReverse Directory shows a listing for a Betty Ford at this location.) Aquino is6’, 145 lbs.,brown hair, green eyes, California Driver’s License ######, showing a mailingaddressin 1976 of Box 243, Santa Barbara. Subject is listed as the registered owner ofa 1979Mercury wagon, Calif. Personalized license “XEPER”.

Additionally, at the time ofthis report, my officerbranch was Armor, not Military Intelligence.64 False. In 1981 I was assigned as USAR Advisor to the Commander of thePresidio of San Francisco.I had never been previously assigned to the JCS nor represented myself as such.Officer assignmentsare a matter of official record, which Daly could easily have checked.65 Neither Browning nor Mann were “lieutenants of mine” within the Temple ofSet, just individualinitiates with their own interests and activities.66 While I am not sure what possible relevance this DMV information has to theTemple of Set, it isalso inaccurate. I have never owned a Mercury station wagon, and the 1979Mercury Capri that I didown in 1981 did not have “XEPER” license plates, nor had it ever been involvedin any accident, muchless “junked”.67 While as a Professor of Political Science at Golden Gate University I taughtmany different courses,“Western European Political Affairs” was not among them.68 False. I have never in my life patronized any prostitute, nor do I have anyinterest in sado-masochism. Daly, unsurprisingly, names no names nor sources for thisextraordinary assertion.- 58 -be bi-sexual, 69 he resides with his girlfriend (possibly Ford), her children,and hismother. 70GROUP POTENTIALSources state that this cult is becoming potentially more and more violent71 asit recruitsthe less intellectual and more undesirable level of people such as formermembers of theHells Angels and similar cycle gangs. 72 Another rumor surfacing is that theyareinvolved in animal sacrifices. 73Investigation into this group is continuing.Respectfully submitted,Sandra C. Daly, Policewoman, Star 1918Approved by:Daniel J. Murphy, Captain, Star 647SFPD-68 (9-70)What is perhaps most striking about this report is that such a vague,inaccurate,unsubstantiated, and malicious diatribe should be accepted by a San FranciscoPoliceCaptain and Intelligence Division Commander as a valid “intelligence” document.Indeed one must also wonder why Daly was considered to be an competentIntelligenceDivision officer at all, if this represents the quality of work she produced.Also obviously, the moment the “S-word” - Satanism - is introduced, the reportenters into a special Twilight Zone of prejudice, in which anything connectedwith theorganization or individuals is inherently “sinister”, no matter how benign orirrelevant69 False. I am a lifelong heterosexual - which Daly should know is a strictrequirement for Armyofficers.70 Betty Ford was my mother, who lived in one flat while Lilith and I lived inanother.71 The Temple of Set has no history of nor doctrines advocating violence at all,as Daly, with easyaccess to arrest/conviction files, could easily verify but obviously did notwish to.72 The Temple of Set as a matter of policy has never “recruited” anyone, norsought the interest of anyother group or organization. To the best of my knowledge in 37 years it hasincluded no current norformer Hells Angels or other “outlaw bikers” as members. If such an individualwere to requestadmission, however, his interest would be judged on its sincerity as fairly asanyone else’s.73 False. Since its founding the Temple of Set has maintained an absoluteprohibition of not onlyanimal sacrifice, but any harm to or exploitation of animals at all. This isspecified strictly in theTemple’s membership literature, which again Daly didn’t bother to consult.- 59 -it might be in any other context. 74 Thus “Army officer”, “MilitaryIntelligence”, andeven teaching at a university become alarmisms, whereas if I had happened to beaChristian or a Jew such credentials would have been complimentary andcommendable.The obvious message of this officially-accepted report was that Michael Aquinoandthe Temple of Set were a serious and increasing danger to the city of SanFrancisco.Two weeks later Daly decided to warn the U.S. Army about its Satanic peril. Shetelephoned Lt. Colonel T.C. Jones of the Army’s Criminal Investigation CommandinFalls Church, Virginia to advise him about Major Aquino and Captains Mann &Browning. Jones, not considering this a criminal matter, passed it along toDepartmentof the Army Counterintelligence. Possibly Satanists are Soviet spies? 75At the Pentagon Colonel Donald Press, Director of Counterintelligence, checkedwiththe FBI and found no record of the Temple of Set. Again not surprising, as theTemplehad never been involved in or investigated for any illegal activity. Again thedreaded S-word had reared its menacing head: If a “Satanic cult” were on file anywhere, itwouldcertainly be with the FBI. It never occurred to Press to check with the IRS foritsextensive files on the Temple as a perfectly legitimate religious institution.76Not knowing what else to do, but still concerned that the S-word must meansomething worrisome afoot, Colonel Press referred the matter to U.S. Army ForcesCommand at Fort McPherson, Georgia. 77 From there it was passed along to theimmediate commanders of the three demonic officers in question, in my case theIntelligence & Security Chief of the Sixth U.S. Army at the Presidio, Lt.Colonel JohnRichards. 78 Richards then responded with what Daly could have found out forherselfin the first place had she bothered to ask:74 Ironically San Francisco’s most famous Satanist, Anton LaVey, was notconsidered by the SFPD tobe dangerous, presumably because he was dismissed as merely a “carnival clown”using Satanicimagery for self-advertisement.75 Letter, Lt.

RICHARDSLTC, GSChief, Intelligence and SecurityBack at FORSCOM Colonel Durham decided that enough time had been wasted onDaly’s monster hunt, closing the action and remarking to the Pentagon’sCounterintelligence office, “The same ‘not unfavorable’ and inconclusiveinformation isgenerally reported telephonically from other recipients of our 2d indorsement reallegations in basic letter.” 79At the Presidio Colonel Richards hadn’t bothered to mention this curiouscorrespondence to me. I didn’t learn about it until mid-1982, when Dennis Mann,having heard about it from his headquarters, asked for copies and forwarded aset tome. While no harm had been done except the wasting of various Army officials’time, Idecided I’d better get in touch with this mysterious Officer Daly and clear upwhatmight be an innocent misunderstanding on her part. At the time I had not seenand didnot know about her 7/7/81 report, nor other equally inaccurate reports by her,such asa horrific misrepresentation of the Black Mass on 7/8/81 (Appendix #15). 8079 4th Ind, Lt. Col. Durham, op.cit. , 12/18/81.80 This is significant because in her report of the previous day, transcribedhere, Daly accused theTemple of Set of planning just such a Black Mass in San Francisco.- 61 -I therefore went down to the San Francisco Hall of Justice (SFPD headquarters)andpaid a call on Daly. 81 She and her supervisor Sergeant Jerry Belfieldacknowledged thatthey indeed had a file on the Temple of Set and myself, but adamantly refused toshowit to me or even discuss its contents. The most they would do was allow me toadd acopy of the Temple’s official public informational paper to the file. On11/29/82 I wroteto Belfield:This past summer you and Officer Sandi Daly were kind enough to discuss thematter of your file concerning the Temple of Set with me. While you told me thattheSan Francisco Police Department’s policy is that I am not permitted to know whatis inthe file or who may have made what allegations concerning the Temple, you alsosaidthat you would include in the file any descriptive material the Temple cares tosubmitconcerning itself.Hence I enclose, for inclusion in that file, a copy of the Temple’s basicinformationalpamphlet and a copy of the more extensive membership letter which is sent inanswerto inquiries from readers of the pamphlet.Thank you again for seeing me at such short notice, and for your courtesy duringthediscussion. Should the San Francisco Police Department ever have furtherquestionsconcerning the Temple or any alleged affiliate, you are welcome to contact me,as itschief executive, directly.I daresay my letter would not have been quite so gracious had I seen Daly’ssecret,defamatory reports “Temple of Set” and its companion “The Black Mass” (Appendix#15). Both of these remained concealed from me until 1989. In 1982 I still gaveGallantthe benefit of the doubt as being a policewoman making an honest effort to learnabouttopics of which she was innocently ignorant.That was my sole personal contact with Gallant until the 1987 search-warrantraid ofLilith’s and my home, at which she appeared. Neither she nor Belfield had everresponded to my invitation to contact me concerning either the Temple ofSet/myselfor occult topics generally.In those interim years, however, Gallant continued to write and distribute aseries ofSFPD-official papers with such names as “Satanic Cults/Sabbat Celebrations”,“RitualCrime Scene Clues”, “Related Crimes”, “Homicide Investigations”,“Sabbats/Festivals:Paganism, Witchcraft & Satanism”, “Colours Significant to Satanism/Witchcraft”,“Sabbats or Celebrations”, “Definitions: Satanism and Witchcraft”, etc. When inJanuary 1986 San Francisco Examiner reporter Ivan Sharpe, who was writing astoryabout Satanism, sent me a set of these papers, I took the time to send himitemized,81 In 1986 Gallant told San Francisco Examiner reporter Ivan Sharpe that I hadso “terrorized” thereceptionist that she had left the building immediately after I arrived. Since Iwas merely an Armyofficer in dress green uniform politely asking the way to Gallant’s office, Ican only suppose my eyeswere glowing red and smoke coming from my ears at the time. Even so, I wonderthat the receptionistin San Francisco Police headquarters, of all places, should feel “terrorized” byanyone.- 62 -detailed critiques. Reprinting all of them here would be tedious for me and apainfulreading experience for you, but I have included one at Appendix #16 as anexample.An additional Gallant paper - “Ritualistic Crime Profile & Questionnaire” - wasdistributed in 1987 by an organization calling itself the “California Consortiumof ChildAbuse Councils”, indicating that Gallant had been distributing her materialsoutside ofgovernmental law enforcement officialdom.Following the 8/14/87 SFPD raid on our home [as recounted in Chapter #4], myattorney obtained a copy of a videotaped lecture by Gallant to other policeofficers onthe subject of “Satanic Cults”. It contained her usual, disjointed recitation offalsehoodsand irrelevancies, both concerning the Temple of Set/myself and occultismgenerally,while stressing the newly-vogue theme of “ritual child abuse”. “Children havebeentaken to cemeteries and placed in open graves, and to crematories and forced tohavesexual activity there,” Gallant told her horrified audience. And yet: “We havenot beenable to prove one [Satanic ritual homicide] to date.”- 63 -Chapter 4: The San Francisco Police InvestigationThe evening of Friday, August 14, 1987 began calmly enough at 123 Acme Avenue. Iwas in my study, working at the computer, while Lilith and her daughter werewatchingtelevision in the sitting room. Then at 9PM there was a knock at the front door.Thinking it to be her son or brother, who were both living in the downstairsflat, Lilithopened the door - and found herself staring at a man in a suit holding a largecrowbar.He identified himself as San Francisco Police, said that he had a warrant82 tosearch thepremises, then walked in, followed by several other men in plainclothes.Lilith’s first impression, when she got over her immediate shock, was that weweresimply being robbed. Then she saw two uniformed policemen bringing up the rearofthe group, which appeared to number about ten individuals. She asked one of thepolicemen for identification, at which he pointed to his shoulder-patch andremarked,“This is all the ID you need, lady.” [Throughout the entire raid, not one of theofficerswould produce any identification in response to Lilith’s or my requests.]Hearing the commotion, I walked out of my study and encountered the man withthe crowbar, who waved a paper at me so fast that I could not read anything onit. Hesaid that it was a search warrant, and then told me to go into the sitting roomwithLilith and her daughter, to empty my pockets on the table, and then to sit downon thecouch with them and be quiet. The rest of the raiding-party had alreadydispersedthroughout the flat and were beginning to open drawers, closets, and cupboards,rummaging through and removing many of the contents. A photographer walkedaround the flat, photographing the entire interior as well as articles, artobjects, etc.which were called to his attention. Accompanying the raiding-party was apolicewomanwhom I recognized as Officer Sandi Gallant, the SFPD’s “occult expert”.As would be all too evident later, once my attorneys and I had discovered thefullextent of her well-poisoning activities, Gallant had apparently succeeded inconvincingthe SFPD that the Temple of Set, under my evil sway, was a bloodthirsty “sataniccult”just waiting to pounce upon a helpless San Francisco. Clearly when Larry A-Twalkedinto his office to accuse us of a horrific crime, Sergeant/Inspector GlennPamfiloff ofthe SFPD Juvenile Division was therefore well-primed to anticipate anotherMansonFamily-spectacular bust. How else to explain all of the muscle that he broughtalongwith him to our home that evening?It is difficult for someone who has not been through such an experience tounderstand just how stressful it can be. We still had not the remotest idea whythiscould be occurring, or what judge could possibly have authorized such aninvasion.Lilith and her daughter were severely frightened, and I was trying to decidewhat ifanything to do. Presumably the raid had been timed for late Friday evening tosurprise82 The SFPD Search Warrant is at Appendix #14.- 64 -us when we were the most tired and psychologically vulnerable - and when ourchancesof contacting our attorney would be minimal.The man with the crowbar - who I would later learn was Sergeant/InspectorPamfiloff - was across the sitting room rifling one of Lilith’s personal filecabinets. Iasked him if I might read the search warrant. He refused. I asked him what thisraidwas all about, and he made no answer. Finally I asked him if I could walk acrosstheroom to telephone my attorney, to which he nodded assent. Fortunately I foundtheattorney, Mark Coleman, at home and told him what was happening. He said that hewould be right over, and by 10 PM he walked through the door.It is remarkable how the presence of an attorney changes things in suchsituations.Coleman asked to see the warrant and was given it immediately. Noting that itwasunsigned, he read it and then passed it to me. All that I could make out in abriefreading was that it was for evidence of child sexual abuse. Being unaware of anysuchallegations concerning ourselves, Lilith and I could make no sense of thiswhatever andcould suppose only that it was all a grotesque mistake. Meanwhile, said Coleman,therewas nothing to do but wait until the search had run its course. FollowingColeman’sarrival I was permitted to walk through the flat to see what was happening,though notto approach any of the raiders nor touch any item at all.In the middle of this nightmare there were elements of surreal humor. First ofall, ofcourse, was the reaction of the SFPD and FBI raiders to the exotic decor andartwork ofour home. I think they [and especially Gallant] spent as much time beingtourists asconducting a search.The library and files in my study consisted of thousands of occult papers andbooks,mixed in with military and academic texts and files. In a very short time theFBI agentswere totally at sea. One would pick up a book of Egyptian hieroglyphics orsigils of theElizabethan magician John Dee, flip helplessly through a few pages, then drop itonly topick up something else equally obscure. They had the photographer take picturesof myceremonial robes from the Church of Satan and Temple of Set - and also of myPh.D.robes from the University of California, which they evidently considered equallysinister. They photographed some Don Post Hollywood masks from my collection -toinclude one of the original Darth Vader helmets from Star Wars. Then they made arealfind:Going through my files of photographs they came across an album of snapshotsshowing men, women, and children being tortured and killed in any number ofhorrificscenes, some involving the most shocking Satanic orgies. The album wasconfiscatedwith great fanfare. I stood across the room, shaking my head. In London there isa veryfamous tourist attraction called the London Dungeon, a wax museum which consistssolely of exhibits of the occult and macabre. I had visited it a couple of yearspreviously,and it was my snapshots of some of its exhibits that the FBI had found!Then Pamfiloff triumphantly brandished a photograph of a laughing naked baby ona bearskin rug. “That’s just Michael,” said Sandi Gallant to the crestfallenInspector.“Look at the eyebrows.”- 65 -Next he dug into a small tin box from one of the closets and dramaticallyunfurled aNazi battle flag, which the photographer scurried to shoot. “If you will lookthrough therest of that box,” I said mildly, “you’ll see that it contains my father’scombat souvenirsfrom World War II, including maps, his medals, and his unit and rank insignia.”Foiledagain.Walking through the halls to our living room, I was confronted by a similarscene ofdisarray. Paintings had been removed from the walls, art objects had been pickedupand played with, and closets had been opened and their contents strewn about.Encountering Sandi Gallant, I asked her what had caused this invasion. Shelooked atme blandly and said that she had no idea; she had merely been invited along asanobserver.After the first hour or so it obviously became clear to the raiders that, asexotic asour home might be, it did not contain evidence of anything the least criminal.Theattitude of the raiders - with the marked exception of Pamfiloff himself, whoremainedcold and accusatory - became less aggressive and more polite. The two uniformedofficers wandered around for awhile, then left. The FBI left. Only Pamfiloff,obviouslyfrustrated, continued to search. “This guy thinks he’s a magician, so he mayhave somegood hiding places,” he remarked to another officer at one point. 83 He came toamysterious covered object. He removed the cover and confronted our Heathkitrobot4E (named after Forry Ackerman, Hollywood’s science-fiction entrepreneur). Thephotographer was summoned and 4E was duly mug-shotted.By 1AM Pamfiloff had removed a number of our personal belongings and Temple ofSet papers to several paper bags and cardboard boxes. I asked to inventorythese; herefused to permit it. “As none of this material has anything to do with thesearchwarrant,” I said to Coleman, “why is he confiscating it?” Coleman shrugged. “Hecan’treturn empty-handed to the judge who issued the warrant.” Then, as Pamfiloffdeparted, I asked how soon I would be able to reclaim the property. “Check withus in acouple of weeks,” he said off-handedly, then was gone. Coleman stayed with usfor afew more minutes, then left as well.So at 1AM Lilith and I found ourselves standing in the middle of our home -furniture, papers, clothes strewn about us - and still totally bewildered atwhat couldconceivably have caused such an event. After Coleman took his leave, Lilith -who hadmanaged to keep her composure during the ordeal - finally broke down inhysterics. Itwas several more hours before sheer exhaustion overcame her fear and anger andshewas able to catch a few hours’ sleep.It took us most of the the following day to get our home back into somesemblanceof order, and then on Sunday morning we went downtown to the offices ofPillsbury,Madison & Sutro, the law firm which I had previously used only for routinebusinessaffairs.Presiding at the meeting was Maurice D.L. Fuller, Jr., a senior partner of thefirmwho looked just like senior partners are supposed to look: regal, white-haired,and83 Aquino, M.A., Memorandum for Record 8/15/87.- 66 -omniscient. With him was Bernard Zimmerman, chief criminal attorney for PM&S,whose pin-striped gravity was offset by his perennial frustration with theenvironmentin which he operated. Mark Coleman, who as a business attorney would not play inthisparticular game, was present primarily as a witness to the events of Fridaynight.“I’m sure you came down here wanting to sue everyone involved,” said Fuller,“butin affairs of this sort the real world has little in common with televisiondramas. Thecity government will back up anything the police do, and the public - to theextent theycare at all about such things - generally assume that the police only do thingslike thiswith justification. Any sort of litigation against the police would be extremelyexpensive- we’re talking about several hundreds of thousands of dollars - and would by nomeansguarantee you a victory no matter how right you are or how wrong they are.”“The first thing we have to do,” said Zimmerman, “is to get our hands on a copyofthe SFPD incident report that Pamfiloff is required to file concerning thisaffair. Untilwe can review that, we won’t know why this happened at all. So I advise you tojust coolyour heels until we can track it down.”So that is what we did for the next two weeks - until August 28, when Zimmermancalled to say that he had finally obtained the search warrant and incidentreport andwas having a courier bring copies over to us [see Chapter #2 & Appendix #14]. Wereadthrough them in utter astonishment, which quickly turned to anger at thisunknownArmy officer for making such a foul attack on us.I immediately wrote to Pamfiloff [with a similar letter to Foreman]:It is only today that my attorney was able to acquire and provide me with copiesofthe incident report form and your own affidavit on which the search of my SanFrancisco home was based. Until today my wife and I had no idea what couldconceivably have caused this traumatic incident.If you were under the impression that you were closing in on a child-molester orsex-abuser, then I can at least partially understand the abruptness of your actions.Fromyour affidavit it is clear that you have seen more than enough cases of childabuse inrecent years to make you quite adamant about putting such people out ofbusiness. Mywife and I view such perversions with as much revulsion as you do, and endorsecommunity efforts to eliminate them.What I have more trouble understanding, however, is why the mere responses of a3-1/2 year-old child - who was 2-1/2 when these incidents are supposed to haveoccurred - were considered adequate to overwhelm my lifelong reputation as aresponsible, moral, and respectable individual.For the last several years the media have repeatedly shown how so many children“sexually abused by Satanists” were merely coached by disturbed orpublicity-seekingadults to say such things. Why did this possibility not cause you to look morecarefullyinto the physical possibility of my presence in San Francisco this last year?Moreover, if the media are correct, this child is the same one whose testimonyconcerning this Hambright person was disallowed by a judge on the grounds thatshe is- 67 -too young for it to be competent. 84 Am I to assume that her stepfather has theprerogative to overrule the judge in this and merely point a finger at anyone hechoosesto set this sort of thing in motion?85At this point in time Lilith and I still had no idea who this “Larry A-T” was.Lilithrecalled having seen a television news clip a short time earlier in which someArmycaptain had been denouncing a judge for having disallowed the testimony of hisinfantchild in the Presidio scandal. We supposed that this was the same individual.[As itturned out, we were wrong. The captain on the news broadcast had been MichaelTobin(see Chapter #1).]The Presidio had received a new commander since my departure the previous year,Colonel Joseph V. Rafferty. He and I didn’t know one another, but I did know hisdeputy, Colonel D. Peter Gleichenhaus, very well. I telephoned him at home andaskedto meet with him. The next morning Lilith and I were in his office, showing himthepapers we had just received and describing what we had just been through.Gleichenhaus said that he had known nothing about it, nor had Colonel Rafferty.The mysterious Larry A-T, he said, was a Christian chaplain (with the rank ofcaptain),who had been assigned to the Presidio garrison shortly before my departure forWashington. At that time his name had been Thompson; shortly thereafter he hadmarried Michele Adams and taken the combined name. Gleichenhaus added that A-Thad just been reassigned to the 25th Division in Hawaii, but, as far as he knew,was stillliving in Presidio quarters prior to moving.The actions I subsequently took concerning A-T are recounted in the laterchapterconcerning court-martial charges against him, but the focus of this one is whatdeveloped with the San Francisco Police Department.In trying to make sense of the raid on our home, I could only conclude thatGallanthad succeeded in spooking the SFPD with tales of Satanic horrors, and thatofficerssuch as Pamfiloff had thus merely been waiting for an excuse to break into ourhomeand our files. Larry A-T’s horrific accusation offered him the excuse he needed.I wroteto SFPD Chief of Police Jordan, protesting Pamfiloff’s and Gallant’s actions andrequesting his help in correcting the situation (Appendix #17). This wasfollowed by asimilar letter from my attorney (Appendix #18).As was the case with my previous letter to Pamfiloff, the SFPD responded toneitherof these letters. The following month I wrote Jordan again (Appendix #19), oncemorereceiving no answer.It was now disappointingly clear that the SFPD had no interest in a cooperativeandpositive resolution of the awkward situation caused by their raid and property84 I was mistaken, confused by the media fragments of which I was aware at thetime. David Tobin’scompetency to testify concerning Hambright had indeed been disallowed by a judge[see Chapter #1].The Adams-Thompsons’ allegations never proceeded to indictment or suchpost-indictment judicialdecisions.85 Aquino, M.A., Letters to Glenn Pamfiloff and Clyde Foreman, 8/28/87.- 68 -confiscation. The next step, advised our attorney, was to ask a judge to orderthe returnof our property. Simultaneously, to make a formal statement of our position, weshouldfile a claim for damages against the city. So we did. Each of our claims read:Description of Accident/Occurrence & Describe the Injury and Damage Claimed:Illegal search and seizure of property from the Aquinos and continued illegalretentionof property, all in violation of the Aquinos’ constitutional and other legalrights, andcausing them substantial emotional distress and humiliation and substantialexpense inrecovering their property.Name and/or I.D. Number of Public Employee(s) Involved: Glenn Pamfiloff, Star#228, Sandra L. Gallant, Star #1918, Frank M. Jordan, Chief of Police.Name(s) of Witness(es): Mark J. Coleman, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro.Itemization of Claim: Special and general damages (and punitive damages asapplicable) resulting from the above incident.Total Amount of Claim: $1,000,000.0086Our attorney was both matter-of-fact and accurate about what would happen next.“Don’t expect a $2 million check. The City Attorney will routinely deny theseclaimsand advise you that you have six months to sue the city to enforce them. Don’tsue,however, because if you do, in order to retaliate the city will instantly filecriminalcharges against you based on the A-T allegations - even if it knows they’refalse and thatthe court will throw the case out. The SFPD will now keep their investigationopen untilyour six-month window for suing the city has expired, even if it has realizedlong beforethat that the allegations are baseless. Only then will it announce closure. Butnow we’llgo ahead with a court action for return of your property.”What Pamfiloff had actually confiscated from our home was not authorized by hissearch warrant (Appendix #14). Per his own inventory he took:From living room: 36 video tapes, 2 loose slides, 1 notebook, misc. loose paperswithnames and addresses. 3 binders letters.From master Bedroom: 6 cassette tapes, 1 roster names, 2 notebooks with names,andaddresses.From master bedroom closet: 1 packet negatives.From rear den: 1 Radio Shack TRS80 Mod 100 computer in black case, 1 receiptfromRadio Shack, 2 photo albums, 1 black binder with letters & names, 1 note pad.From kitchen: 1 paper plate and 2 plastic gloves (from garbage).From front study: 4 plastic negative packets, 29 photos. 87But what this actually consisted of was this:86 San Francisco City Form 0301-02, M.

The sameheldtrue for the photographs and negatives Even allowing for the SFPD to wish toreviewthe video and audio tapes, and to examine the computer (a littlefirst-generation RadioShack desktop) to ensure that they contained what their labels indicated, a fewdaysshould have sufficed for all of this material to be acknowledged as irrelevantandreturned to us. Instead the SFPD retained it and ignored our requests for itsreturn,leaving the newspapers to keep sensationalizing the “36 videotapes and otheritems”that had been seized; “obviously the police had found something!”.On 10/28/87, after two months of this treatment, we filed suit in San FranciscoMunicipal Court (the same court which had issued the search warrant) to force88 Inventory provided to Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, M. Aquino, upon receivingcopy of Pamfiloffinventory.- 70 -identification and return of all of the property. This Motion to RestorePropertyappears at Appendix #20.On 11/24/87 the motion was heard in court. What happened then was summarizedby the 11/26/87 San Francisco Examiner:Legal Move Halts Hearing for SatanistIn a rare twist, a Municipal Court hearing involving Lt. Col. Michael Aquino,president and “high priest” of a Satanic church, came to an abrupt halt Tuesdaywhenthe judge was presented a writ from a Superior Court Judge. The writ, fromSuperiorCourt Judge Timothy Reardon, was over the issue of whether a district attorneycouldbe present at the Municipal Court proceeding, since no charges are pendingagainstAquino.Municipal Court Judge Philip Moscone had ruled that Assistant District AttorneyGeorge Butterworth could not officially represent the state in the hearing. Hedid,however, allow Butterworth to remain in an advisory capacity and assist policeSgt.Michael Seybold of the department’s legal office, who is also an attorney.Butterworth objected, then apparently sent an aide to the higher Superior Courttoseek a writ stopping the hearing. Served with the writ in court, Judge Mosconesmiledand said, “I’ve seen this done in the movies, but never seen it done for real.”Bernard Zimmerman, Aquino’s attorney, was in court Tuesday to ask JudgeMoscone for the return of 36 videotapes, a computer, and address- and notebooksthatwere taken August 14 by Police from Aquino’s Russian Hill apartment during theinvestigation into child molestations at the Presidio Child Care Center.The home was searched based on information from a 3-1/2-year-old girl who toldauthorities that Aquino and Gary Hambright had molested her in a private homeoff theArmy base. 89 No charges have been filed against Aquino.However, before the issue of Aquino’s property can be decided, a Superior Courthearing will have to determine whether Butterworth can officially participate.Before Tuesday’s hearing was halted, Zimmerman contended police had exceededtheir authority by taking more than the search warrant allowed.We promptly communicated with the D.A.’s office, saying that we would not opposethe D.A.’s participation in the hearing if it would get the hearing going againpromptly.The D.A.’s office refused to withdraw their request for the stay writ. So wenext went tothe Superior Court asking that, since we were not opposing the D.A.’sparticipation, theSuperior Court itself cancel the writ and authorize the hearing to recommence.Itrefused.Why the obstruction and stalling by the D.A.’s office? Apparently because theSFPDattorney wasn’t handling things well, and because it was feared that the SFPDwouldshortly be ordered to return all of the seized property. [In his written requestfor thewrit to the Superior Court, Butterworth stated: “I am informed and believe thatthere is89 As documented in Chapter #2, Kinsey A-T said nothing of the sort. Theallegations were made byher stepfather Larry A-T.- 71 -currently pending no criminal prosecution, either locally or federally, to whichtheproperty seized in the search warrant at issue pertains.”]An order to immediately return all of the property would presumably have madetheSFPD that much more vulnerable to a finding of illegal search and seizure, whichneither the D.A. nor the SFPD wished to see happen.Before the D.A. had succeeded in aborting the Municipal Court hearing, Pamfiloff(who had brought into the court a container with all the confiscated items) wascalledto the stand. When my attorney Bernard Zimmerman asked him what I was beinginvestigated for, Pamfiloff responded, “Child stealing and various subsections,childabuse, child neglect, child molests, rapes.” 90 It appeared that he was merelyreciting acatchall laundry-list of possible child crimes, which was certainly beyond thescope ofthe Larry A-T allegations [and which I didn’t appreciate seeing on the eveningtelevision news].A month later contacted Walter Radtke, a current member of the Temple of Setliving in San Francisco, and asked to meet with him for lunch. Radtke agreed,and in a12/7/87 telephone call with me recounted their conversation.“I got this phone call from Pamfiloff. He was a little bit nervous and kind ofevasive,and just said he wanted to meet me somewhere. I met him in a restaurant down onthecorner here. He seemed to be anxious. His main line of questioning was whetheror notI had been exposed ... He wanted to know, as a Setian I°, whether or not I’dcome in anycontact with literature that implied or expressed the use of children in anyritualisticmanner whatsoever, and I told him absolutely not. And I also told him that alltheSetian literature was available to him through the Intelligence Department,SandiGallant; that you had released this information; that he could check up on thebackground and go through the reading list on his own and verify that fact.“Then he asked me if I had much contact with any of the other members, and Isaidonly one, with Priest Mitchell Wade on three occasions; and nothing of thatnature wasever brought up in any way.[The Bay Area O.T.O., an Aleister Crowley occult society, was then mentioned byRadtke, who gave an account of a boring ceremony that he had attended at a localartgallery. Pamfiloff then told him ... ]: “of an O.T.O. person prosecuted forchildmolesting, and said they found letters from the O.T.O. head telling the guy tostop suchactivities or he would be thrown out ... essentially rationalizing that theO.T.O. was aclean organization, that they were cool, but you guys weren’t.“And then he started bringing up facts about you and your cohorts, andessentiallytrying to convince me that you were some kind of pervert. He said, ‘Well, youknow thisAquino man. This guy is like, he’s known to have had homosexual liaisons and tobe apervert, and how would you like it, to have your kid ...’And he seemed .... he was essentially trying to convince me that you weren’tsomebody, you know, worth protecting or anything. And I told him that I hadabsolutelyno indication of that, and in fact your material was a wholesome departure fromAnton90 Channel #2 Evening News, 10/29/87.- 72 -LaVey’s Church of Satan. Then he dismissed Anton LaVey, saying, ‘Oh, he’s just amediahound, Hollywood type; he’s pretty harmless.’ I said, ‘Yeah, Sharon Tate,right?’“And I think he finally discovered he wasn’t getting anywhere with me. He didn’ttryto turn me into an informer or anything, but he did request that if I receivedor heard of,or got any implication that there was the use of children in any ritualisticpracticewhether written or implied, he’d appreciate it if I sent that along.“I said you were planning a lawsuit against him, and he just countered thatratherrapidly, a little too rapidly, and said if a lawsuit were to hinder aninvestigation, itcertainly wouldn’t hinder this one. He was playing the part of merely theofficerassigned to the case, but he seemed to have something of a vendetta. He saidseveraltimes, in as many words, that they were out to get you, that they were going tonail you.“I got the feeling that essentially they’re trying to drum up, trying toapproachpotential defectors to get some sensationalized testimony out of them. Itwouldn’t takemany. It’d take probably one. As a matter of fact I’ve seen cases like thiswhere theyessentially try a character assassination operation, and they’ll get perjuredtestimonyfrom one witness. Oftentimes it’s enough with a sympathetic court and jury, etc.“Well, Officer Pamfiloff said, and I quote: ‘We’ve been after this guy for sixyears.’ Hekept saying, ‘This guy’s a kook, he’s a nut, but he’s really smart.’ And I toldhim, ‘If he’sso damn smart, why would he act so foolishly in such a way that could easilyincriminate himself?’ Pamfiloff just sort of clammed up. I’d be interested toknow whois in the [SFPD] Intelligence Department. Somebody is feeding that stuff fromtheoutside ... They can be very stubborn, and if they find themselves being ground,theywill generate evidence.” 91By way of response I decided to send Pamfiloff another letter (Appendix #21). Aswith my previous letters to him [and anyone else at the SFPD], it wentunanswered.On 1/15/88 Pamfiloff released some of the items. When Lilith and I flew to SanFrancisco from my current Army duty station in St. Louis to take delivery, weasked tomeet with him in his office. It was my hope that in a face-to-face dialogue wemight beable to get past the stone wall that letters seemed unable to bridge.First we reviewed the confiscated property he was still keeping:3 video tapes containing footage of business meetings and reception at theTemple ofSet Conclave, Holiday Inn of Santa Cruz, California, 10/5-7/1984. [None showsanychildren or contains anything the least pornographic.]92Several issues of Hieroglyphs, the Priesthood newsletter of the Temple of Set.[None ofthese issues contains any material the least bit relevant to child abuse ormolestation, or to anything else criminal.]91 Telephone conversation transcript, Walter Radtke and M. Aquino, 12/7/87.92 A videocamera was set up in one of the hotel rooms the Temple used for breaks& relaxation. It waswell-stocked with food. Pamfiloff retained about six hours’ video of variousSetians devouring veggies,chips, and dip.- 73 -Several photographs of my wife, myself, and other adult members of the Temple ofSet/Church of Satan. [None contains anything the least pornographic.]Several [non-pornographic] photographs of my wife and her son Christopher incostume, 1973.An issue of the Temple of Set newsletter Runes containing an article onnostalgia [non-pornographic].All audio-cassette tapes [non-pornographic except for Linda Blood’s answering-machine statements].Lilith Aquino’s household notebooks.Assorted Temple of Set rosters and administrative papers. [None of these paperscontains any material the least bit relevant to child abuse or molestation, ortoanything else criminal.]93While Pamfiloff did not dispute our assertion that none of the retained propertywasevidence of anything criminal, he still refused to release it. This of coursewas stillunsatisfactory, as it allowed the SFPD, and hence the press, to say that some ofthematerials it had confiscated were still considered relevant to the allegationsandinvestigation.Unfortunately the conversation then took an unproductive turn, with Pamfiloffinsinuating to Lilith that entries in her notebooks were “suspicious”, whichincensedher [beyond her already/understandable dislike of this man who had broken intoherhome]. At this point Shawn Hanson, who had been growing visibly angrier atPamfiloff’s tone and questions, abruptly interjected, “This interview is over!”And so weleft.On 1/28/88 Bernard Zimmerman sent a letter to the District Attorney proposingrelease of the remaining property and a joint statement by the D.A. andourselvescooperatively ending the investigation. Shortly thereafter Pamfiloff telephonedhimrejecting the proposal and adding that he had now begun to question otherPresidioday-care children to see if he could get “identifications” from any of them.While on onehand this signaled that the A-T allegations were now considered defunct, thisnewfishing expedition was a disturbing development. By now, of course, Lilith’s andmyfaces had been all over nationwide media in connection with the A-T allegations,andanyone with an interest in that coverage could “identify” us [or coach a childto do so].Such coached “identifications” were a notorious staple of the “ritual abuse”witch-huntsaround the United States. I therefore sent Pamfiloff the letter at Appendix #22.Again itwent unanswered.And so the situation remained until 8/2/88, when the San Francisco Chroniclementioned that the case had been dropped by the District Attorney’s office: thecustomary “insufficient evidence” disclaimer rather than outright exoneration.Ourattorneys had been right about one thing: Our deadline to legally enforce ourclaimagainst the city had expired a little over a month previously.93 M. Aquino inventory for Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, 1/20/88.- 74 -Despite the official closure of the case, the rest of our confiscated propertywas stillnot returned. Not until 1/30/90, in response to a 1/24/90 demand letter from ourArmy attorney Captain Thomas Tinti, did Judge Philip Moscone finally sign anorderreturning all of the remaining property to us, which the SFPD did withoutcomment [orapology]. 94 As for the press which had sensationalized the property seizure foryears, ittook not the slightest notice.The Office of Citizen Complaints InvestigationWhile as explained above our attorneys had warned us against suing the City ofSanFrancisco/SFPD until the deadline for doing so had passed, I was still intenselyfrustrated that Gallant and Pamfiloff, apparently on nothing more than theirprejudicesand whims, could just force themselves into our personal lives, wreak as muchhavoc asthey desired, then simply waltz away without concern or accountability.Examining the organizational and supervisory structure of the SFPD, I discoveredthe existence of the Office of Citizen Complaints within the San FranciscoPoliceCommission.The OCC, supposedly a “watchdog” agency concerning police misconduct, had untilnow had something of a marginal history, simply because it had no actual powertoenforce its findings or punish any misbehaving police officers. The SFPDessentiallyignored it as mere public relations window-dressing. Nevertheless it hadrecentlyreceived a new Director, who had announced his intention for improvement [seeAppendix #23]. I decided to give it a try. On 4/8/88, while Pamfiloff’sinvestigationwas still open [as were our two Claims against the City of San Francisco], Ifiledcomplaints concerning both Gallant and himself (Appendices #24 & #25).I did not expect that the OCC would or could devote much time or attention tothesecomplaints. As noted in the Recorder article at Appendix #23, it was alreadysufferingfrom understaffing, a sizable backlog of complaints, and a shrinking budget.Then, too,it presumably was more concerned with instances of physical harm: gunshots,batoninjuries, rough arrests, unjustified arrests, that sort of thing. As angry asLilith and Iwere about what Gallant and Pamfiloff had done to us, it was also true that wehadnever been physically manhandled, handcuffed, arrested, or even touched in anyway.The death threats and home-vandalism that had resulted from Pamfiloff’s raid andstatements were more the consequence of press sensationalism than the SFPD perse.Well, I decided to lay the facts as they were out for the OCC and see what, ifanything, it might say or do about them. The case was assigned to Ms. Irene F.Rapoza,an OCC Senior Administrative Analyst as well as an SFPD Officer herself. Herinvestigation took over 1-1/2 years - complicated, she once commented to me, byGallant’s and Pamfiloff’s reluctance to meet with her or provide her with all ofthe94 Minute Order, San Francisco Municipal Court, Judge Phillip Moscone, 1/30/90,signed 2/20/90:“It is hereby ordered that the property seized in the investigation of Lt. Col.Aquino be returned tohim or his representative.”- 75 -documents and files she requested from them. On 11/22/89 OCC Director Langersentme the official letter of his findings, reproduced here as Appendix #26.Prima facie I was satisfied with it. The two most important complaintsconcerningGallant and Pamfiloff were “sustained”, and the retention of our property andPamfiloff’s overall conduct of his investigation were judged an improper SFPD“procedure failure”.Significantly, in addition to this Appendix #26 letter, there was a much longerandmore detailed official report that went from the OCC to Chief of Police Jordan.Myattorneys and I were allowed to see it only within the OCC office premises, andthenonly if we all signed a strict non-disclosure agreement. OCC Director Langertold methat this odd provision had been insisted upon by the SFPD when the OCC firstcameinto existence - that the OCC is not at all liked by the SFPD and that it foughtitsestablishment and tried its utmost to limit its effectiveness. Langer added thatthePolice Officers Association quickly and aggressively sues any violation of thenon-disclosure agreement in order to attack the OCC’s effectiveness and intimidateOCCcomplainants. 95So detailed and extensive was this particular “behind-closed-doors” report,indeed,that my Army attorney Captain Thomas Tinti (who had read it) immediately wroteLanger for permission to provide it to the Army CID.96 Langer refused, however,sayingthat §832.7 of the California Penal Code prohibited this absent a court order orgrandjury subpœna. 97What transpired during the next six months was related to me by Irene Rapoza. 98The OCC report went from the OCC to the SFPD Chief of Police, who accepted itwithout qualification. The report then went to the SFPD Management ControlOffice,which is in charges of recommending disciplinary or corrective actions withintheDepartment. Such actions fall into one of three categories, from least to mostserious:Counseling, Admonishment, or DisciplineConcerning Gallant the MCO directed her Lieutenant that she be formallycounseled(“Counseling” level) concerning her collection and use of information, both onthe joband in her secondary occupations (i.e. her commercial marketing of her “occultexpertise” and “satanic ritual abuse” publications). The MCO further directedherLieutenant to review and purge her files of any improper “intelligence”information.Concerning Pamfiloff, he received written reprimands (“Discipline” level)concerning his statements regarding his investigation as well as his failure tofullycooperate with the OCC investigation. The MCO further directed the Captain ofthe95 Conversation, Michael Langer and M. Aquino, OCC office, San Francisco,12/4/89.96 Letter, Captain Thomas Tinti to Michael Langer 12/6/89.97 Letter, Michael Langer to Captain Thomas Tinti 12/12/89.98 Telephone conversation, Irene Rapoza and M. Aquino, 5/15/90.- 76 -SFPD Juvenile Division to review the entire investigation of Lilith and myselftodetermine policy or supervisory problems, then to institute changes as required.The MCO further found it improper that none of my letters to the SFPD had beenanswered, and directed that this situation be corrected.Further as a result of this investigation, continued Rapoza, the San FranciscoPoliceCommission (parent organization of the OCC and the SFPD) had instructed the SFPD“to write a new general order directing that intelligence be gathered andmaintainedonly on strictly criminal activities and organizations”.On the issue of our still-unreturned property, the OCC recommended that the SFPDconsult with the City Attorney for a policy about return of property when nochargeswere filed. The existing SFPD policy in this regard, in the OCC’s opinion, wasinadequate.And that was as much of the “tip of the iceberg” as I am legally permitted toreporthere from information provided directly to me at the time.Six months later, however, the San Francisco Examiner (which presumably hadn’tsigned any nondisclosure agreements), brought much of the rest of the icebergsurgingto the surface (Appendix #27).1991: Encounter at Ellis Brooks ChevroletOn 4/16/91, after all of the other events recounted in this book had run theircourse,Lilith and I were again in San Francisco, visiting an old friend of ours, theGeneralManager of Ellis Brooks Chevrolet. Across the showroom floor two men in suitswereadmiring some of the new cars. Then one of them noticed us and came over with awarm smile on his face. He shook my hand, then Lilith’s. “Remember me? Glenn -Glenn Pamfiloff!”To say that we were dumbfounded is a comic understatement. This was the officerwho had been so adamant that we were child-molesters/kidnappers/worse who hadescaped justice? We might now have been old college buddies at a reunion. Hewavedhis companion over, introduced him as his current partner in the SFPD’s RobberySection, and once again it was smiles and handshakes all around. Lilith and Iwere stilltoo astonished to plumb our emotions for any residual indignation, so somewhatsurreally found ourselves matching the two officers’ cheerfulness.Although Pamfiloff gave the impression that he had essentially lost interest inourcase the moment the SFPD closed it in 1988, he now commented that he himself hadnever really wanted to open it to begin with. It was originally the CID/FBI whohadwanted a search warrant for our home, he said, and only when the U.S. Attorney“wouldn’t touch it” did they come to him and ask him to obtain one through theSFPD.He confirmed that he had never once met or spoken to Kinsey A-T herself - onlyherstepfather Larry. He added that over the course of his investigation he hadtalked with“many, many other children”, and that not one of them had “identified” or madeanyaccusations against either of us.- 77 -It was a shame how the Army had hounded us, he continued, and he was glad tohear that our ordeal was finally over. More smiles and handshakes, followed by“Goodluck!” wishes from both officers, and they left the dealership ... while Lilithand I staredat one another, still stupefied.2000: Encounter on the InternetOn 4/19/2000 I received, once again “out of the blue”, the following email:Dear Michael,I’ve noticed my name come up, over the years, within your organization andfriends.Recently I’ve done a search on your name and seen the bombardment that you’vebeenexperiencing.Well, maybe it’s time for the real “lead investigator” to set all the PresidioDay CareCenter stuff straight.Send me your direct phone number, and I’ll give you a call.Sincerely,GlennP.S. I tried to approach this when we met on Van Ness, at the car dealership,about 7-8years ago, but I guess it didn’t connect.We exchanged telephone numbers, and a few hours later had a friendly telephoneconversation. I learned that he was now retired from the SFPD and living withhis wifein a pleasant East Bay town. The following morning I received another email fromhim:Dear Michael,I enjoyed yesterday’s conversation and look forward to getting together onTuesday.Hopefully I’ll be able to correct some of the injustices that have been heapeduponyou in the “Presidio Day Care Center” investigation.Sincerely,GlennLater that same day, having reviewed some of my recent Internet posts defendingLilith and myself against the still-occasional “Presidio” mud-throwing effortsagainstus, Pamfiloff emailed again:Dear Michael,I’ve read your recent messages, regarding the particulars of the investigationagainstyou.You must remember that I worked with most of those investigating you. You seemtowant to break down every little iota to its nexus, but I want to try to keep itat its mostbasic. “No evidence against you” doesn’t need to be answered with specifics.- 78 -If no other children, of the 100+ interviewed identified you, nor any of thechildrenidentified your home, as a respected child abuse investigator I would have toassume,that you were not involved with these children.This is the entire point of my contacting you.I’m sure that if you were the evil man that so much of the media makes you outto be,especially with your notoriety, at least one of “Dr.Lt.Col.’s” children wouldhaveattributed some nefarious act to you.Well, I found no evidence, other than the first, very doubtful identification ofyou atthe PX, and the very stretched identifications within your home, and a few, verystretched relationships, that in anyway could find you guilty of any childabuse.My hope is to put this information into the public sector, to clear you of anyrelationship with Mr. Hambright, of which my investigation found none, and toclearyou of any involvement with the children of the Presidio Day Care Center.I do not purport to have full knowledge of your life’s activities, nor to acquityou ofthe myriad of attacks that you have sustained.I do not in any way wish to affiliate myself with your church, but I do wish tomakesure that justice is done in the Presidio Day Care Center matter, and that aninnocentman can have some peace from the media onslaught that he has undeservedlyreceivedfor these many years.I will attempt to get the truth out, and with our meeting of this coming week, Ihopethat we can achieve a mutually acceptable means of achieving just that.Respectfully yours,GlennWhile it was true that a statement of “no evidence” from the case’s leadinvestigatorhad an authoritative simplicity to it, I thought he might not understand thatthe subjectof that investigation certainly did not have that luxury, but indeed had to“break downeach and every iota”. I responded the same evening:Dear Glenn,> You seem to want to break down every little iota, to its nexus, but I want totry to keepit at its> most basic. “No evidence against you” doesn’t need to be answered withspecifics.My apologies for the admittedly exhaustive analyses. Particularly during the CIDinvestigation, I was made to feel that it was my responsibility to account for“every iota”of anything that investigators could conceivably twist into something“suspicious”. So Igot quickly into the habit of dissecting everything in microscopic detail,turning thebrightest possible light on it.> Well, I found no evidence, other than the first, very doubtful identificationof you atthe PX- 79 -“Very doubtful” boils down to nothing more than the say-so of the two adultA-Ts,who were established to have lied about numerous elements of that event.> and the very stretched identifications within your home,“Very stretched” boils down to Larry A-T’s lucky guess that one of the rooms inthehome of a “Satanist high priest” just might be painted black. But he got theroom wrong,and there was no pentagram on its ceiling. And he lied to you about attributingeventhat image to a Hickey-session:In all of the Hickey session notes there is not a single mention of a “blackroom”anywhere - not by Hickey, not by Kinsey. As for an object on the ceiling, thereis not asingle mention of a pentagram. The Hickey session note that Larry A-T personallyrevised into what he told you was this on 6/2/87:“Asked her if there was a big pot that hung down from the ceiling therewith legs sticking out. Said it had legs, arms, and a penis. Said the ‘deadpeople’ were ‘blue’ in color. Said the penis went pee on her shoes.”That’s it. I think you will agree that there was no pot full of blue dead peoplehangingfrom the ceiling of our bedroom and peeing on your shoes as you walked in thatevening!> and a few, very stretched relationships.I’m not sure what you’re referring to here. Neither Lilith nor I ever had anycontactwith the A-Ts [and to this day we don’t know what any of them look like, sincewe’venever even seen photos of them]. We never had any contact with Hambright, oranyoneelse at the daycare center. We never had any contact with any of the “copycat”cranks,etc.> My hope is to put this information into the public sector, to clear you of anyrelationship with Mr.> Hambright, of which my investigation found none, and to clear you of anyinvolvement with the> children of the Presidio Day Care Center.I understand and very much appreciate this, as does Lilith.> I do not purport to have full knowledge of your life’s activities, nor toacquit you of themyriad of> attacks that you have sustained.I quite understand that. I take full responsibility for my own life, warts andall. As forthe various SRA-lunatic-fringe ravings that resulted from all the Presidiopublicity,that’s to be expected from our “colorful” American social spectrum. I ignoremost of the- 80 -over-the-top drools, and just answer honest public inquiries as frankly andcourteouslyas possible.FYI The most recent of the drooling category is some conspiracy-theorist inEnglandwho’s decided that I am an agent of a race of lizard-men planning to take overtheplanet. That’s a new one!> I do not, in any way, wish to affiliate myself with your church, but I do wishto makesure that> justice is done in the Presidio Day Care Center matter, and that an innocentman canhave some> peace from the media onslaught that he has undeservedly received for thesemanyyears.Thank you. A pleasant weekend to you and Mrs. Pamfiloff, and I look forward toseeing you Tuesday.Sincerely,MichaelAs it turned out he fell ill - I sensed from his voice on the telephone that hewas notin the best of health - and we were not able to meet. A month later I sent himanotherletter, feeling that there was a final, crucial point I needed to make. I havenot heardfrom him since, and would like to think that this does not mean that his healthworsened critically.May 27, 2000Dear Glenn,Enclosed are photocopies of your original Incident Report and of the searchwarrantpapers. In addition to the original Incident Report, here also is my annotatedtranscriptof the same Report. I didn’t know all this information in August 1987, andobviously youhad no way of knowing it either when Larry Adams-Thompson showed up in yourofficeand gave you his little story. It took me years to piece the truth together, tosearch outall the documentation, and often much FOIA tooth-pulling to get papers which Iwasobviously never supposed to see.But here it is, and once again I think the sum total of it is pretty clear:Adams-Thompson and his wife weren’t by any stretch of imagination “innocent victimsjustconcerned about their little girl”. They knew that nothing had happened to her.Theyknew we had never done anything to her. They also knew that they had anopportunityto defraud the government of $3 million, and all they had to do was hide behind“that’swhat Kinsey told us” and “that’s what the therapist told us” - then sit back andwatchpublic hysteria over the well-known “Satanism” of the Aquinos railroad us intoprison,probably there to be ourselves raped or beaten to death as reportedly oftenhappens topersons convicted of child sex crime.I know that in our phone calls you’ve said that you thought the Adams-Thompsonswere nice people. If I could see in their actions just an honest mistake, Iwould say so.But what is down in cold documentation here are not one, nor a few, but avirtually- 81 -endless stream of lies, changing stories, and maneuverings by both of them toget their$3 million over the dead bodies of myself and my wife. To say nothing of theircold-blooded decision to bring up their little girl believing that she had beenkidnapped andgang-raped when none of that had ever happened at all.Lilith and 1 spent years of fear and stress defending ourselves against whatthose twovicious people tried to do to us. It severely damaged our health, terrified ourfamilies,destroyed my pending promotion to full colonel, and as you’ve seen on theInternet hasbeen seized upon by any number of unstable crackpots to stalk us in lunaticconspiracytheories. So yes, we’re deeply bitter about it. The fact that the Army didn’thave the gutsto court-martial Adams-Thompson, but instead cooperated in their scheme and paidthem their money, makes it all the worse.Our respect for human integrity and decency has certainly been revived by yourcontact and offer to provide us with your letter. Lilith and I want you to knowagain howvery much we appreciate it.Sincerely,MichaelAnd so after all of the stressful, disheartening, and embittering events of theSanFrancisco Police investigation of Larry and Michele A-T’s vicious little scheme,enhanced by Sandi Gallant’s years of equally-squalid well-poisoning at theDepartment,it ultimately transpired that Glenn Pamfiloff and Michael & Lilith Aquinofinally foundand made a quiet, mutually respectful, and I think I may indeed say friendlypeace withone another.During one conversation Pamfiloff mentioned that over his many years in the SFPDJuvenile Division he and his partner had “investigated, prosecuted, and helpedtoincarcerate hundreds of pedophiles and child molesters”. He would have been lessthanhuman if such a depressing and revolting series of cases didn’t take a grindingtoll onhis own nerves, enjoyment of life, and respect for the human race generally.Perhaps if Larry A-T had come to him ten years earlier with his concocted story,Pamfiloff might have been less inclined to rush to judgment, more careful toexaminethe accuser before agreeing to examine the accused. But the Glenn Pamfiloff of1987had probably come to carry within him a simple, dark hatred of all monsters whoinjurechildren, and this - together with Sandi Gallant’s “expert” assurance thatMichael andLilith Aquino were indeed two such monsters, instantly imbued him with a single-minded determination to slay those monsters. If I am correct in this, mylogical,reasonable letters to him weren’t unconvincing in their content; they were justdistractions in their entirety, to be brushed aside in favor of the original,dedicatedpursuit.But as Glenn Pamfiloff’s final encounters prove, there was ultimately a greaterhumanity in him, a sense of decency and integrity, that any past horrors of hispolicecareer could not completely overwhelm. He was, in the final reckoning, a GoodCop.- 82 -Chapter 5: Court-Martial Charges Against Larry Adams-ThompsonThe Elephant in the Dark RoomLarry A-T was an official Christian chaplain of the Army Corps of Chaplains,withthe government-mandated mission of representing and promoting Christianity toallsoldiers with whom he came into contact.I, on the other hand, was “quite the other thing”: from 1970 to 1975 a Priest ofSatan,and thereafter High Priest of the ancient Egyptian god Set. The Army didn’t haveanySatanic or Setian chaplains, of course, nor do I think it would have beencomfortable ifI had requested equal time in the post chapel for a Satanic Mass or Setianinvocation ofthe ancient gods.Throughout my Army career I had addressed this situation by simply keeping myreligion to myself, except when asked about it by friends, senior officers, orsecurityclearance officials. Then I would discuss it frankly and honestly, withappropriatetolerance and courtesy towards conventional religions.Until 1987 this had sufficed reasonably well, though the higher in rank Ibecame, themore of a curiosity and gossip-object I found myself. By all accounts I had anexemplary and blemish-free service record, but the United States Army couldn’tquiteassimilate the idea of an officer conjuring up dæmons and Egyptian gods, anddoing abit of Black Magic on the side. Even my “normal” behavior while on duty wasunsettling; like H.P. Lovecraft’s sinister Joseph Curwen in The Case of CharlesDexterWard, I was “suspected of vague horrors and dæmonic alliances which seemed allthemore menacing because they could not be named, understood, or even proved toexist.” 99Despite this, once Army commanders and colleagues managed to get over theiroriginal qualms, as they invariably did, they found themselves enjoying this“oddity” inthe otherwise-undisturbed social climate of the service. Amusingly this alwaysincludedthe local chaplains, who obviously enjoyed the opportunity for some very“different”theological and metaphysical conversations. Indeed in 1977 my currentheadquarterswent so far as to award me a monstrously-decorated certificate which proclaimed:99 Lovecraft, Howard Phillips, At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels,Sauk City: ArkhamHouse, 1964, page 115.- 83 -The 306th Psychological Operations BattalionpresentsThe Esoteric Order of DagontoMajor Michael AquinoIn recognition of his knowledge of Mysteries unnatural, unnamable to theuninitiateand unspeakable to the profane, the above-named officer is hereby designated anHonorary Unit Chaplainwith license to celebrate masses, extract and hear confessions, and keep awayfrom thisbattalion all ghoulies and ghosties and long-leggity beasties and Things that goBump-in-the-Night.While assigned to the Presidio of San Francisco Headquarters 1981-86, I hadknownthe two chief Protestant and Catholic chaplains, both colonels, as good friends,I hadn’thad any personal contact with A-T, an assistant Protestant chaplain who hadarrived onthe post shortly before I left in June 1986 for my next assignment inWashington, D.C.As I would later learn, however, A-T and his wife were very interested in Lilithandmyself - whom they saw at occasional Headquarters social functions.After Larry A-T made his allegations against us, our respective religiousaffiliationsand offices became “an elephant in a darkened room” - an unacknowledged,unspoken,but very real factor in the ways we were respectively treated by the variousofficers,headquarters involved. Essentially those who did not know anything about meotherthan my religion - which to them was simply the “S-word” making such horrific“SRA”headlines across the country - attempted to reject contact/dialogue with me asmuch asthey legally could, while A-T on the other hand was a sanctioned icon of theCorps ofChaplains to be sheltered and protected.Bluntly, it was unthinkable that an official Army Christian chaplain could becourt-martialed and punished for a crime against Satanists. Jesus Christ is Good,after all,and the Devil is Evil. Everyone knows that.Except that the U.S. Constitution, and the Uniform Code of Military Justicebasedupon its principles, actually didn’t know that. Instead they held that Americanjustice,including military justice, should be indifferent to religion and focus insteadupon thestatements and actions within a given incident. It was with the Constitution andUCMJin mind that I sought such justice. I soon realized that, as Batman observed inTheDark Knight Returns, “the world only makes sense when you force it to”. 100First DiscoveryAs recounted in Chapter #4, for the two weeks following the surprise raid on ourhome Lilith and I had absolutely no idea why it had taken place or who wasresponsiblefor apparently making criminal allegations against us.

Thompson. Iimmediatelywrote to him at his Presidio address [on my St. Louis, Missouri letterhead]:August 28, 1987Dear Captain Thompson:After a year’s assignment in Washington, D.C., my wife and I were able to pay ashortvisit to our San Francisco residence early this month. At 9 PM on Friday the14th, ateam of San Francisco police officers and FBI agents arrived at our front doorwith awarrant to search the premises, and for the next four hours my wife and I coulddonothing but stand by in shock and bewilderment while our entire home andpersonaleffects were ransacked. After the police finally left, and after I hadendeavored tocomfort my wife, who was severely frightened by this unexplained invasion, ittook methe rest of the night and the following day to restore our strewn-about clothes,papers,and personal effects to some semblance of normalcy.That night we were told nothing more than that the officers were searching for“evidence of child molesting”. Not until today was my attorney able to acquire acopy ofthe enclosed form from the S.F.P.D. I now find out that you are the individualwho isresponsible for this incident.I have no way of knowing what sort of leading questions you may have put to yourstepdaughter at the P.X., if indeed you did not fabricate that incidententirely. But if youhad taken just a moment to check with the Presidio Headquarters, or the officerrecordssection of COMPACT, you would have learned that I had been assigned as aresidentstudent at the National Defense University from August 1986 through July of1987.There is no possible way my wife or myself, who have been living in an apartmentinWashington, D.C. for the last year with our S.F. home closed up, could have beeninvolved in the Presidio day-care scandal, even if we were that kind of people -which weare most emphatically not.Even during my assignment to the Presidio from 1981 to July 1986, my wife and Inever had anything to do with the child-care center, nor with this GaryHambrightperson, nor with your stepdaughter, nor - as far as I can recall - with you. Whyyou nowdecided to abuse us so maliciously I cannot possibly imagine.By your vicious, irresponsible, and thoroughly disgusting accusations you havebrought about the violation of my home, severe trauma to my wife and family, andaninsult to my own integrity that is especially foul and loathsome, based as it isupon thesexual abuse of little children. Only if you send me immediately a letter ofcomplete andunqualified apology and retraction for this disgraceful conduct of yours will Iconsidernot taking legal action against you, via civil suit or per applicable UCMJprovisions.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military Intelligencecc- Commander, Presidio of San FranciscoInspector Glenn Pamfiloff, S.F.P.D.Special Agent Clyde Foreman, F.B.I.- 85 -No answering letter was received, but on September 10th, by which time Lilithand Iwere back in St. Louis, an unsigned pornographic card stating “BLOW IT OUT YOURASS YOU POMPOUS JERK!” arrived in our St. Louis mailbox [otherwise unknown toany participant in the Presidio scam]. I wrote to Captain A-T (who I had learnedwasnow assigned to the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii):September 10, 1987Dear Captain Adams-Thompson:To date I have received no letter from you in answer to mine of August 28th. Ontheother hand, I have today received an extremely vulgar card (copy enclosed)which, whileunsigned, was postmarked in San Francisco on the day you would have received myletter at your Presidio of San Francisco address.That you were still taking delivery of mail at that address when my letterarrived isestablished by the lack of a forwarding address filed with the PSF post officeat thattime. [My envelope was marked “address correction requested”, and a USPS cardwouldautomatically have been sent to me had you had a change-of-address on file bythe timemy letter passed through the PSF post office for local delivery.]I might also add that by 9/2 virtually no one in San Francisco - and certainlyno onelikely to send a card like this - had been advised of my new St. Louis addressexceptyourself. Since you have already shown evidence of your true character by thedisgusting and utterly false accusations you furtively made against my wife andmyself, Iconclude that this card represents all the consideration you gave to my letter -and allthe concern you have for the harm you have done to two innocent people. If so,it is notsurprising that you didn’t sign it, as that would have committed you to astatement thatyou could not use your infant child to “hide behind”.If you care to deny having sent this card, I would welcome a letter from you tothateffect - and repudiating its message.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceThis letter was unanswered as well.On 12/1/87, therefore, I wrote to Major General James Crysel, CommandingGeneral of the 25th Division, recounting the situation in as much detail as Iknew at thetime, ending:... I therefore conclude that Adams-Thompson deliberately intended to smear mygoodname, that of my wife, and that of our church with this abominable accusation,countingon media sensationalism and public ignorance not only to compound the damage tous,but also to shield him from the consequences of falsely and maliciously accusingafellow Army officer of a serious felony.To date it appears that he has been quite successful in this. No officialactions havebeen taken against him whatever. The Presidio Judge Advocate’s office excusessuchinaction as being a necessary consequence of the “ongoing investigation” intothePresidio scandal as a whole. This is absolutely unjustified, since the factssurrounding- 86 -Adams-Thompson’s behavior in this incident [cited in this letter] are allclearlyestablished, and since Adams-Thompson’s false accusations against me are notconnected with any molestation activities which may have been perpetrated at theday-care facility by Hambright or anyone else. To delay justice in Adams-Thompson’scase isnot only to allow him to savor what he has done; it is to indefinitelyperpetuate andaggravate the continuing public ordeal of my wife and myself.While Adams-Thompson has been free to enjoy his new duty station in Hawaii, myfamily and I have gone through three months of protracted agony because of hisvileaccusation. We have been questioned by scores of military associates, familyfriends,and business associates. We and our church have been caricatured sensationallyandinaccurately by many commercial media. Our personal privacy and the religiousprivacyof our church have been and continue to be regularly violated as though we aremerefreaks for public entertainment; we are forced to respond to continued inquiriesonly totry to preclude at least the more bizarre distortions in the inevitable coverage[whichreporters are quite skilled in phrasing to circumvent libel]. We have learned toourdistress that even the most polite declining of interviews usually results inhostiledistortions by the reporters in question.My wife and I have received several death and arson threats on our telephoneanswering machine. Our San Francisco home has been vandalized, forcing me tospendover $3,000 in repairs and protective reinforcement. Our tenants in the buildinghavealso been harassed and traumatized by vandalism. The building has become a“touristattraction” in the city, with groups of people ogling it daily.After a lifetime of cordial relations with the San Francisco Police Department,I nowfind myself in an adversarial legal battle against them because of theirbureaucraticrefusal to reverse the search/confiscation action they took solely on thestrength ofAdams-Thompson’s accusation. This legal action has already cost over $6,000 inattorney’s fees, and will certainly cost several tens if not hundreds ofthousands ofadditional dollars if we are forced to pursue the matter into state and/orfederal court torestore the good name and property of ourselves and our church.Add to this the countless man-hours the Department of the Army has now had todevote to responding to reporters concerning this affair, and the damage to theArmythat has nonetheless resulted from some reporters’ crude castigations of theArmy formy religious “oddity” as though it were something despicable. Even my Top Secretsecurity clearance, though not compromised in the least by my religion nor evenrelevant to this situation, has been headlined as though it were a scandal initself.And add to this the very notion that a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army “may belinkedto child-molesting at the Presidio” [as the stories “carefully” state], whichnecessarilyreflects that much more adversely upon the Army officer corps as a whole.I think that Chaplain Adams-Thompson fully deserves to be dishonorablydischargedfrom the Corps of Chaplains and from the U.S. Army for his disgraceful andunethicalactions and the severe damage resulting from them, which ill-dignify the moralandConstitutional standards which the Corps of Chaplains is expected to defend andexemplify. I am advised that I can prefer charges against him under Articles#133 and/or #134 of the UCMJ, whose elements of proof may be reasonably determined toinclude such behavior as Adams-Thompson’s. I am fully aware, however, of the- 87 -sensationalistic domestic and foreign media coverage that would certainlydescendupon the court-martial of a Christian chaplain in defense of an officer who is aSatanicPriest - particularly in view of the grotesque stories which have alreadyappeared innewspapers, magazines, and television about Adams-Thompson’s accusation and myreligion.I think that any administrative actions which the Army can take to preclude suchaspectacle would clearly be in the Army’s best interests. For these reasons I amwilling toaccept a letter of reprimand by yourself to Adams-Thompson, placed permanentlyin hisofficial file and identifying explicitly and without equivocation his unethicalbehaviorand religious discrimination in this case. If I am advised in writing by 1January 1988that this has been done, I will initiate no UCMJ action against him.If either you or higher commanders should decide not to issue such a letter ofreprimand to Adams-Thompson by this date, then for my honor, the honor of mywifeand family, and the honor of the religion we follow in accordance with theprovisions ofthe United States Constitution, I will commence with such legal action againstAdams-Thompson as is available to me under the UCMJ. It should be understood that suchalegal action, if I am forced to undertake it, would be most actively pursuedwith all theresources at my disposal - and I expect that its administrative handling andeventualdisposition would be as meticulously observed and commented upon by the nationalmedia as they have done since Adams-Thompson activated their interest. I cannotseesuch a situation being to the benefit of the U.S. Army or its Corps ofChaplains, andsincerely hope that administrative action to rectify the injustice perpetratedby Adams-Thompson will make it entirely unnecessary.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceFirst Court-Martial ChargesWhile under the Uniform Code of Military Justice any commissioned officer mayprefer court-martial charges, it is traditional professional courtesy to allowcommanding officers of problem individuals the first opportunity to address thatproblem. Hence this initial communication to General Crysel. When after a monthIhad received no response whatever, however, I formally swore to charges againstA-Ton 1/4/88 and sent them to the 25th Division for disposition. The Charge Sheet(DDForm 458) read:CHARGE 1: VIOLATION OF THE UCMJ, ARTICLE 133SPECIFICATION 1: In that Chaplain (Captain) Lawrence P. Adams-Thompson,U.S. Army, Third Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, onactiveduty, did, while assigned to the Headquarters of the Presidio of San Francisco,California, on or about 12 August 1987, knowingly and with malicious intent makefalsestatements and representations defaming the characters of Lieutenant ColonelMichaelA. Aquino and Mrs. Lilith Aquino.- 88 -SPECIFICATION 2: In that Chaplain (Captain) Lawrence P. Adams-Thompson,U.S. Army, Third Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, onactiveduty, did, while assigned to the Headquarters of the Presidio of San Francisco,California, on or about 2 September 1987, answer a letter from LieutenantColonelAquino demanding an apology for and retraction of Adams-Thompson’s actions inSpecification 1 with an obscene and disrespectful card mailed to LieutenantColonelAquino.The Charge Sheet was accompanied by sworn statements by Lilith and myself, oncemore detailing all that we knew at the time; Pamfiloff’s SFPD Incident Report;the twoletters I’d sent to A-T; and the obscene card received. Our sworn statementsappearhere as Appendices #28 & #29. They are particularly significant not just becauseofwhat they say, but because of the extensive amount of additional evidence thattheywere made in as-yet ignorance of. In other words, a proper investigation of thechargeswould have exposed many more supporting facts and documents - from the FBI & CIDreports to the Hickey notes - as discussed in Chapter #2. As will be shown here,thatinvestigation into these charges would never be made.Article #133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice is prima facie simple anddirect:Article 133. Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentlemanAny commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conductunbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial maydirect. 101Behind this short statement, however, are quite detailed elements of suchoffensesand explanations concerning them. These are reprinted here in Appendix #30.In this instance, Specification #1 was clearly the essential one, withSpecification #2[concerning the card] being included simply because, if it were determined byinvestigation to be from Larry A-T, it was a #133 violation as well. 102For readers who may not be familiar with the UCMJ, the formal preferral ofchargesis an extremely serious action. The preferer must sign the charges andspecificationsunder oath before another commissioned officer, state that he has personalknowledgeof the matters set forth therein, and swear that they are true in fact to thebest of hisknowledge and belief. To put this another way, the deliberately false preferringofcharges would itself be an actionable and punishable violation of Article 133.103101 Uniform Code of Military Justice, §933, Art. 133, page A2-33.102 And arguably UCMJ Article 134 as well, which among other things prohibits“the depositing orcausing to be deposited obscene matters in the mail” .

Colonel, Judge AdvocateStaff Judge AdvocateThis made no sense to me. The next step was obviously to ascertain why thisdecision had been made. On 6/23/88 I sent an answering letter:Dear Colonel Hagan:I have just returned from leave and have received your letter of June 2ndstating thatChaplain Adams-Thompson’s commander has dismissed the court-martial charges Ipreferred against Adams-Thompson, on the grounds that the preliminaryexamination“failed to uncover any evidence to support the charges”.I have consulted with the ARPERCEN Command Judge Advocate’s office and amadvised that, as the individual preferring the charges, I may make a Freedom ofInformation Act request to receive a copy of the preliminary investigationreport and allsupporting documentation upon which Adams-Thompson’s commander based hisdecision. By this letter I make this FOIA request.I further request to know if Adams-Thompson’s immediate commander has taken oris contemplating any non-judicial punishment of Adams-Thompson in lieu of acourt-martial action. Please include the commander’s name and unit.I further request the name and mailing address of the next higher commander inAdams-Thompson’s chain of command with court-martial jurisdiction.A prompt response to these requests will be greatly appreciated, as it has nowbeennine months since Adams-Thompson’s defamatory actions against my wife andmyself,and six months since I preferred the charges.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceOn 7/5/88 Colonel Hagan responded that Colonel Sierra had since been reassigned,but that the new 3rd Brigade commander was not considering any action againstA-T.Hagan further said that Major General Crysel was also being reassigned as of7/7/88.Finally:- 92 -The local CID coordinated the investigation into your allegations. I forwardedyourrequest for the investigation report to them. I have been informed that thelocal CID hasforwarded your request to the Commander, San Francisco Field Office, 6th RegionUSACIDC, Presidio of San Francisco. 107In other words, Colonel Sierra hadn’t appointed an RCM #303 investigatingofficerat all, but had nominally assumed that role himself. Then, instead of conductinghisown investigation as required under 303, he had simply referred that task to thelocalCID, which in turn had referred it to the CID San Francisco Field Office -exactly thesame office, of course, which had endorsed and pushed A-T’s allegations to beginwith.Shortly thereafter the San Francisco Field Office CID commander wrote to saythathis office was not authorized to release the investigative report, but that myFOIArequest had been forwarded to the national Criminal Investigation Command (CIC)headquarters, which did have that authority.108 It seemed that the 3rd Brigade’sRCM#303 report was becoming more and more bureaucratically elusive, if not indeedevasive. Since General Crysel was now gone as well as Sierra, I decided torefocus theissue with the new 25th Division Commander, Major General Charles P. Otstott. On8/23/88 I wrote him:Dear General Otstott:On January 4, 1988 I preferred court-martial charges against a member of yourcommand, Captain (Chaplain) Lawrence Adams-Thompson, for a violation of Article#133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice directed against my wife andmyself, copyenclosed. I was informed by your Staff Judge Advocate that a preliminary inquirywouldbe conducted accordingly.During the next four months neither my wife nor myself was ever contacted by anyinvestigating official or agency for an interview concerning our swornstatements or anyother pertinent information. Then on May 18 the then-3rd Brigade CommanderColonelSierra dismissed the charges “for lack of substantiating evidence”.In response to my Freedom of Information Act request of June 23 for a copy ofthedocumentation upon which Colonel Sierra based his decision, I have received nocopy ofany investigation of Specification #1 from the 25th Division. I merely receiveda letterfrom SJA Lt. Colonel Hagan diverting this request to the CID. The CID fieldoffices inHawaii and San Francisco responded in turn by diverting it to the CIDCheadquarters inVirginia.Two months have now elapsed since the filing of that FOIA request with your SJA.Itis fairly obvious that no timely provision to me of any investigation papers ofSpecification #1 will be forthcoming. Add to this the lack of any interview withmy wifeor myself during the 4-month “inquiry”, and it is reasonable to conclude that nothorough inquiry under Rule for Courts-Martial #303 was ever conducted at all-thatthe charges were merely stalled for four months, until shortly before the PCS ofboth the107 Letter, William Hagan to Michael Aquino 7/5/88.108 Letter, Captain Stuart S. Taylor to Michael Aquino 7/18/88.- 93 -brigade and the division commanders, and then were dismissed on nothing morethan apretext.With regard to Specification #2 - obviously the lesser of the two specifications- theonly FOIA evidence that any inquiry ever took place was a handwritten note (noteven asworn statement) from the Adams-Thompsons denying it. After the dismissal of thecharges, I requested by FOIA a copy of Adams-Thompson’s travel voucher toHawaii.While there are still unanswered questions in my mind about Specification #2, Ithinkthat sufficient doubt concerning it has now been established to warrant itsbeingdropped, and I do so request.On the other hand, the initial strong evidence concerning Specification #1 hasbeenadded to considerably by the information I have accumulated since preferring thecharges in January of this year - and which I had expected to discuss with aninvestigating officer or agency. This additional evidence appears in my swornstatementof this date, enclosed with this letter. 109In my opinion the dismissal of the charges against Adams-Thompson is amiscarriage of justice and a violation of the purpose of the Uniform Code ofMilitaryJustice and the Constitution of the United States. I accordingly request thatyoureinstitute the charges, with Specification #1 only.A grievous harm was done to my wife and myself by Lawrence AdamsThompson onno evident provocation but a religion held by us that he personally dislikes. Todate hehas not only escaped accountability for this malicious act, but continues tofunction asan Army chaplain, entrusted with the moral and spiritual instruction of Americansoldiers and their families. This is an individual whose actions in the Presidioof SanFrancisco scandal have caused serious harm to innocent people. His moreextensive roleas a possible instigator and aggravator of that scandal should be a subject offocus by theinvestigating officer, as that scandal has caused tremendous damage to theinstallationgenerally, the public image of the U.S. Army, and the many individuals who havesuffered because of it.Please understand that I am firmly resolved to obtain justice in this case nomatter towhat level of the chain of command, or of the United States Governmentgenerally, I amforced to pursue it. I am willing to abide by the decision of a GeneralCourt-Martialwhere Adams-Thompson’s acts are concerned, but I do not think it is appropriateforsuch a verdict to be preempted by an administrative fiat.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

BagnalCommanding General, U.S. Army Western CommandFort Shafter, HI 96858Dear General Bagnal:In January 1988 I preferred court-martial charges against Chaplain (Captain)Lawrence Adams-Thompson, currently assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, for amalicious and defamatory allegation he made concerning my wife and myself. I wasinformed by the division staff judge advocate that these charges would beinvestigatedin accordance with Rule for Courts-Martial #303.Four and one-half months later I was informed that the charges would be droppedfor “lack of substantiating evidence”. I had in fact provided a detailed packetofsubstantiating evidence to the 25th Division, and at no time during the“investigation”were my wife or myself - the victims of Adams-Thompson’s action - ever contactedbyany investigating official.I then requested a copy of the “investigation” conducted by the brigadecommander.The 25th Division SJA then told me that this was not an investigation actuallyconducted by the brigade commander, but rather a CID report used by him. I dulyrequested a copy of this CID report. I have since been informed by the U.S. ArmyCrimeRecords Center that the report is apparently that of the Presidio of SanFrancisco child-- 95 -care center scandal, and is not yet releasable. In short, the information Ireceived fromthe 25th Division that the brigade commander’s specific investigation into thecharges Ipreferred was supported by a CID investigation into those specific charges isincorrect.The conclusion I drew from the above is that a proper, impartial, and completeinvestigation of the charges in accordance with Rule for Courts-Martial #303 wasnot infact conducted, and that the charges were accordingly improperly dismissed bytheoutgoing division commander, Major General Crysel.On August 23, therefore, I requested the new division commander, Major GeneralCharles P. Otstott, to reinstate the charges and initiate a proper preliminaryinvestigation. In support of such an investigation I provided an updated andexpandedpacket of evidence, a copy of which was also sent to you as the next seniorcommander.Today I received the enclosed letter from Major General Otstott. Although manyofthe items of evidence contained in the packet sent to him were never consideredin the“preliminary investigation” and are clearly relevant to the charges, andalthough therewas a conspicuous mishandling of the investigation in the lack of any interviewswithmy wife or myself, and although no documentation of the investigation (thesupposedCID report) appears to exist at all, still General Otstott refuses to evenreopen thepreliminary investigation -which of course would not pre-commit him to anyparticulardisposition upon its proper completion.I do not believe that this is a proper application of the Uniform Code ofMilitaryJustice. Extreme personal harm has been done to my wife and myself by ChaplainAdams-Thompson - a wrong which Article #133 of the UCMJ exists to redress, if sodetermined by a properly constituted and conducted court-martial. The seeking ofjustice under the UCMJ is a right guaranteed to all soldiers, not a favor to bedispensedor withheld peremptorily. I ask your help in seeing that these charges arereinstitutedand that a proper and thorough inquiry is conducted prior to their considerationfordisposition. As two commanding generals of the 25th Division have committedthemselves to the handling of the case as it stands to date, I further requestthat, toensure impartiality, the inquiry and subsequent decisions concerning dispositionberemoved to your level of command.If you have not retained the packet of documentation previously sent to you,pleaseadvise me and I will forward the packet sent to [and returned by] GeneralOtstott.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

AquinoSUBJECT: Court-Martial Charges Against Chaplain (Captain) Lawrence Adams-Thompson1. I have received and considered your letter of 14 October 1988 requesting thatthecharges preferred by you against Chaplain Adams-Thompson be reinstituted andreinvestigated by this command.2. Rule 303, Rules for Courts-Martial, requires a preliminary inquiry into thechargesyou preferred. Such an inquiry was conducted to the satisfaction of MajorGeneralCrysel, who then dismissed the charges. His successor in command, Major GeneralOtstott, declined to reopen the investigation or reinstate the charges, which hefound tobe without substantive merit.3. You are entitled to your opinion that the R.C.M. 303 inquiry into yourcharges wasnot conducted properly or thoroughly However, I do not share your opinion. Yourrequest that the inquiry be reopened and the charges be reinstated is denied./s/ Charles W. BagnalLieutenant General, USACommandingAs with the 25th Division, General Bagnal offered not a word of explanation asto his“without substantive merit” denial. While I could have appealed this denialagain to thenext [four-star] higher headquarters, it seemed obvious that this Christianchaplainwas simply going to be protected, period. Whether the decision came from histwo-starcommander or from some higher authority was evidently not going to be sharedwithme.Meanwhile, every few months I continued to receive a form letter from the CIDC’sU.S. Army’s Crime Records Center advising me that the investigative report ofthe SanFrancisco and/or Hawaiian CID in support of Colonel Sierra’s RCM #303investigationwas “currently ongoing with an undetermined completion date”. 111 Since it hadnowbeen well over a year since that investigation was closed by Sierra, I decidedto writeback:110 Memorandum, Lt. General Charles Bagnal to Colonel Jacunski, 10/27/88, FOIA.111 Letters, Robert Brisentine and Wilbur Hardy, Directors Crime Records Center,to Michael Aquino9/7/88, 1/9/89, 3/29/89, 5/10/89, 5/24/89, 9/7/89.- 97 -September 15, 1989Mr. Wilbur L. Hardy, DirectorU.S. Army Crime Records Center, USACICDear Mr. Hardy:I have received your letter to me of September 7, 1989 once again denying myFOIA/PA request for all CID documents relating to the court-martial charges Ipreferredagainst Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson, 25th Infantry Division, in January1988.You state that these documents “are part of an ongoing investigation with anundetermined completion date”. I enclose, however, a copy of a letter from the25thInfantry Division stating that the charges against Adams-Thompson weredismissed. Ifthe investigation was “complete” enough for the 25th Division commander todismissthe charges, then it is “complete” enough for your denial to be in violation of5 U.S.C.This 9/7/89 letter from you appears to be merely the latest in a series ofmaneuversby the CID to prevent me, as both the officer who preferred the charges and theindividual victimized by Adams-Thompson’s criminal actions, from examining the“investigative report” which the 6th Region CIDC sent to the 25th Divisionconcerningthose charges. These evasions by the CID began in response to my originalrequest forthat “report” on 6/23/88. and have continued to this date.It is my belief that examination of this material will expose the thoroughinadequacyand bias of that “investigation”, and indeed the deliberate effort of the 6thRegion CIDto conceal critical evidence in substantiation of those charges from theCommandingGeneral of the 25th Division and the Commanding General, WESTCOM. Such an act bythe 6th Region CID constitutes an act of misprision of serious offense andobstruction ofjustice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ. Concealment of this same informationby theDirector of the Crime Records Center would place you in the position of being anaccessory to this same violation of the UCMJ.An examination of this material is further important to the exposure of aprejudicialinvestigation subsequently instigated by the same 6th Region CID against me, inwhichdocuments and information proving both my innocence and AdamsThompson’s guiltand establishing the unlawful bias of the 6th Region CID - to include the“investigativereport” sent to the 25th Division - were deliberately concealed from me and mylegalcounsel.I have formally requested Major General Cromartie112 to investigate the conductofthe 6th Region CID Headquarters in this affair, to reopen the criminalinvestigation ofChaplain Adams-Thompson, and to dismiss the fraudulent investigation of myselfaccordingly. The documents I first requested on 6/23/88 - well over a year ago -areimportant additional evidence in support of all three of my requests.I therefore request that you comply immediately both with 5 U.S.C. and the UCMJ,and furnish me with these documents without further delay.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military Intelligence112 Commanding General, USA Criminal Investigation Command (USACIC).- 98 -Copies to:Lieutenant General Charles W.

On 10/20/89 I received areply -not from the Crime Records Center but from the CIC’s Staff Judge Advocate:As to your request for the CID investigative report concerning the charges youpreferred against Chaplain Adams-Thompson in January 1988, no such reportexists.Those charges were determined to be unfounded; therefore no Report ofInvestigationresulted. 113Indeed? I responded directly to General Cromartie:October 27, 1989Major General Eugene L. CromartieCommanding General, USACICDear General Cromartie:I have just received the attached letter #A from your Staff Judge AdvocateLt.Col.Green. I will address other aspects of Lt.Col. Green’s letter in a separateresponse to you,but this one is concerned specifically with the following remarkable paragraphfrom thatletter:As to your request for the CID investigative report concerning thecharges you preferred against Chaplain Adams-Thompson in January1988, no such report exists. Those charges were determined to beunfounded; therefore no Report of Investigation resulted.Please permit me to call your attention to the following:Attachment #B (Letter, SJA 25th Division to me, 4/15/88) states:The commander asked that the local CID office assist in conducting theinquiry. The local CID office requested assistance from the Presidio of SanFrancisco CID office. I have been told that both of those offices arepreparing their final reports concerning your allegations. Once thesereports are received, they will be given to Captain Adams-Thompson’scommander for review and disposition.Attachment #C (Letter, Colonel Sierra to Commanding General, 25th Division,5/13/88) states in paragraph #2.d.:113 Letter, Lt. Colonel Brent Green to Michael Aquino, 10/20/89.- 99 -I asked the local CID office to assist in the investigation.

Iforwarded your request for the investigation report to them. I have beeninformed that the local CID has forwarded your request to the Commander,San Francisco Field Office CID.Attachment #H (Letter, myself to CID Hawaii District Office, 7/8/88) responds toAttachment #F and makes it quite explicit what report I had requested, i.e. theCIDreports referred to by Lt. Colonel Hagan in Attachment #B and by Colonel SierrainAttachment #C.Attachment #1 (Letter, myself to CID Hawaii District Office, CID San FranciscoOffice, et a!., 7/20/88) makes my request further explicit in paragraphs #4 and#5:• The complete documentation of the final report prepared by your office inHawaii in support of Colonel Sierra’s inquiry. In his letter to me of 15 April1988, Lt. Colonel Hagan stated that both your office and the San Francisco FieldOffice were preparing final reports concerning the charges I preferred. I wishtosee the report from your office as well as the one prepared by the San FranciscoOffice.• The complete documentation of the final report prepared by the San FranciscoField Office in specific support of Colonel Sierra’s inquiry.Attachment #J (Letter, Commander CID San Francisco Field Office to me, 7/18/88)acknowledges the existence of the information I requested in Attachment #E, butstatesthat authority to release it is held by your headquarters.Attachment #K (Letter, Commander CID Hawaii District Office, 7/27/88)acknowledges my request and states that it was forwarded to the San FranciscoFieldOffice as “the office controlling this investigation”.To this point in time we have five officers (Lt.Colonel Hagan, Colonel Sierra,ChiefWarrant Officer Walker, Captain Taylor, and Captain Hastedt) who have allacknowledged the existence of the report in question. Colonel Sierra has in factbased- 100 -his recommendation to the 25th Division Commanding General upon it. Now weproceed forward in time to the CID Crime Records Center.Attachment #L (Letter, Director CID CRC to me, 9/7/88) acknowledges my originalrequest (Attachment #E) and states:Your request will be retained in this center until our field elementforwards a copy of the investigative record for releasability review. Uponreceipt of this record, it will be reviewed for investigative thoroughness andlegal sufficiency prior to release.Attachment #M (Letter, Director CID CRC to me, 1/9/89) again acknowledges myoriginal request (Attachment #E) and states that a response to me will bedelayed.Attachment #N (Letter, Director CID CRC to me, 3/29/89) again acknowledges myoriginal request (Attachment #E) and states that a response to me will bedelayed.Attachment #0 (Letter, Director CID CRC to me, 5/10/89) again acknowledges myoriginal request (Attachment #E) and states that a response to me will bedelayed.Attachment #P (Letter, Director CID CRC to me, 5/24/89) again acknowledges myoriginal request (Attachment #E) and states that a response to me will bedelayed.Attachment #Q (Letter, myself to Commander, 25th Infantry Division, 8/3/89)restates my request for the CID report identified in Attachment #E.Attachment #R (Letter, SJA 25th Infantry Division to me, 8/16/89) acknowledgesAttachment #Q and the existence of pertinent “CID documents”, and refers thatpart ofthe request to the CID.Attachment #S (Letter, Director CID CRC to me, 9/7/89) acknowledges Attachment#Q and states:Your request and several documents that originated with this commandwere referred to this headquarters by the SJA Schofield Barracks and werereceived on or about August 15, 1989.A review of the referred documents and coordination with our SixthRegion Headquarters has determined that the documents are a part of anongoing investigation with an undetermined completion date.Attachment #T (Letter, myself to Director CID CRC, 9/15/89) acknowledgesAttachment #S; points out that the “ongoing investigation” excuse used inAttachments#M, N, 0, P, & Q is invalid as substantiated by Attachment #D; and requestscompliancewith my request (Attachment #E) as required by 5 U.S. Code.Further in my letters to you personally of 8/3/89, 8/30/89, 9/27/89, and10/18/89,I restated my request (Attachment #E), identified the CIC’s noncompliance withit inviolation of 5 § 552 U.S. Code and AR 340-17, and requested immediate compliancewith the law by your direction to the CRC as its commander.As demonstrated by the above documentation, one of two mutually-contradictorysituations now exists:- 101 -(a) If this current 10/20/89 letter from your Staff Judge Advocate Lt.Col. Greeniscorrect, two senior officers of the 25th Division, two commanders & one ChiefWarrant Officer of CID field offices, and two Directors of the CID CrimeRecords Center have made false official statements supporting the existence ofthe documents referred to in Attachments #B and #C. Such false officialstatements are in violation of Article #133 UCMJ, and you as the CommandingGeneral of the CIC are required to title those officers accordingly.(b) If on the other hand all those officers and CRC Directors were telling thetruth,then Lt.Col. Green has just made a false official statement and you arerequired to title him accordingly. This is not a minor matter, but a subject ofcritical importance to the Army, as he well knows. Actions to cover up thecrimes of Adams-Thompson as described in the January 1988 court-martialcharges I preferred against him constitute not only an act of misprision ofserious offense and obstruction of justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ, butalso serve to facilitate the deliberate defrauding of the U.S. Government ofseveral million dollars by Adams-Thompson via his fraudulent claims, andpossibly the further defrauding of the U.S. Government of up to $66 million inunjustified claims by other parents participating in the phony Presidio “childmolestation” scam.I request a resolution from you as to whether #(a) or #(b) is correct, and whatactionas CIC Commanding General you will take as required against the officials whohaveviolated the UCMJ accordingly. If you determine #(b) to be correct, then I oncemorerequest that you direct the CRC to comply with 5 § 552 U.S. Code and AR 340-17and,without further evasion, excuse, or delay, provide to me the documentsidentified inAttachments #B & #C and requested by me in Attachment #E.Respectfully/s/ Michael A.

It appears here as Appendix #32.Second Court-Martial ChargesUpon receiving the mysterious, elusive, and purportedly nonexistent CID reportused to justify the dismissal of the original court-martial charges against A-T,Irepreferred the charges and sent them once again to the 25th Division. Ireiterated theFirst Specification from the original charges, for which by now I hadaccumulated [andwas enclosing] additional and more conclusive evidence. I dropped the originalSecondSpecification [concerning the obscene card] because it was far less significantthan theFirst Specification. And I added a new Second Specification, because by thistime I hadlearned of A-T’s filing of a $3 million claim based on his allegations:CHARGE 1: VIOLATION OF THE UCMJ, ARTICLE 133SPECIFICATION 1: In that Chaplain (Captain) Lawrence P. Adams-Thompson,U.S. Army, Third Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, onactiveduty, did, while assigned to the Headquarters of the Presidio of San Francisco,California, on or about 12 August 1987, and in related instances thereafter,knowinglyand with malicious intent make false statements and representations defaming thecharacters of Lieutenant Colonel Michael A. Aquino and Mrs. Lilith Aquino.SPECIFICATION 2: In that Chaplain (Captain) Lawrence P. Adams-Thompson,U.S. Army, Third Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, onactiveduty, did, on or about 15 March 1988, file one or more false claims, based uponthe falsestatements and representations identified in Specification 1, such claim orclaimstotaling at least $750,000 and possibly as much as $3,000,000, and such claim orclaims thus constituting a deliberate attempt by him to defraud the UnitedStatesGovernment. 114Along with this Charge Sheet went a letter from myself to Major General Otstott,explaining the repreferral (Appendix #33). Included with this was an extremelycomprehensive analysis - “Chaplain Lawrence A-T’s Violations of Article 133,UCMJ” -which by this time I had been able to assemble from my continued research[includingextensive FOIA/PA requests]. Provided not only to Otstott in this instance, butto manyother concerned officials and headquarters from this time on, this document hasneverbeen questioned or refuted in any detail whatever. Here it appears as Appendix#33.Nevertheless Otstott dismissed the charges (Appendix #34). I appealed hisdecisionto Lt. General Bagnal (Appendix #36). His successor as WESTCOM Commander, Lt.114 Charge Sheet, DD Form 458, 11/29/89. Accuser: Lt.Col. Michael A. Aquino,Witness: Col. Bobby R.Sanders, Commander, ARPERCEN, St. Louis, MO.- 103 -General Kicklighter, declined to overrule Otstott (Appendix #37). 115 I wroteback tocorrect Kicklighter and request his reconsideration (Appendix #38). No answer.I have reproduced this series of correspondence as Appendices because of theirlength. Altogether the letters establish that Otstott and Kicklighter were stilldetermined that under no circumstances would this chaplain be investigated, muchlesscourt-martialed for either Specification. None of the facts I cited wasinvalidated, norwas I admonished for, in effect, implying that the dismissal of the originalcharges, andsuppression of these repreferred ones, was itself a UCMJ violation of Article#134,Misprision of Serious Offense and Obstruction of Justice.Two two-star Generals and two three-star Generals had now all stood up againstthedoor of Chaplain Larry A-T’s accountability for his actions before acourt-martial, tokeep it firmly wedged shut.And that was that. A Lt. Colonel may lead a General [or several of them] towater,but he most assuredly cannot make him drink.Implications of Information Presented in this ChapterBy January 1988 Larry A-T was aware of enough personal information aboutLilith’sand my Washington, D.C. location in September-October 1987 to know that we couldnot possibly have had any contact with his stepdaughter Kinsey, even if he hadcreditedHickey’s assertion that the child had been molested by Hambright during thatwindow.Nevertheless A-T took no action whatever to withdraw or apologize for hisallegationsagainst us to SFPD Inspector Pamfiloff.This same proof of our non-involvement was available to A-T’s new unit, the 25thInfantry Division. It initiated no corrective action concerning him upon myrequest.When in January 1988 I preferred court-martial charges against A-T, the 25thDivision refused to conduct the required RCM #202 into the elements of proof Iprovided. Further, additional elements of proof, such as FBI documents and theHickeynotes, which I did not at the time know about but which a RCM #202 investigationwould have exposed, conclusively supported the first specification of thecharges.The 25th Division commander dismissed the charges, and the senior U.S. ArmyWestern Command commander upheld his dismissal. Both refused to address theelements of proof in the charges’ supporting documentation.Why these commanders so adamantly and abruptly protected A-T from UCMJaccountability is open to anyone’s speculation. I think it was simply theestablishedprestige and influence of the Corps of Chaplains within the Army, together withignorance, fear, and prejudice concerning the “S-word” - Satanism. It waspolitically115 At this time I was unaware that Kicklighter, in his immediate pastassignment as Director of theArmy Staff, had been the Department of the Army’s action officer to “deal withthe matter of Lt. Col.Aquino” following the October 1988 Geraldo River “Satanism” special on NBCnetwork television [seeChapter #6]. Thus there was a clear conflict of interest in Kicklighter’sdecision concerning A-T, aboutwhich he neglected to inform me.- 104 -unthinkable to prosecute a Christian chaplain for a crime against a Satanist,even if ithad happened.It took me almost two years - to November 1989 - to obtain the RCM #202investigation report, which was repeatedly concealed from me, even to the pointofdenying its existence, until exposure of the concealment became too conspicuous.Thereport turned out to contain no inquiry into the elements of proof of thechargeswhatever.I re-preferred charges, adding A-T’s $3 mission defrauding of the government, inNovember 1989. Considerable additional elements of proof were added. Yet thesecharges were also immediately dismissed by the 25th Division and WesternCommand,again without investigation into any of those elements.Senior dismissing officer this time was Lt. General Claude Kicklighter, who, asDirector of the Army Staff at the Pentagon in November 1988, had on the ordersofSecretary of the Army John Marsh convened a secret, and possibly illegal,meeting ofsenior Department of the Army officials to “deal with me” [see Chapter #6].Kicklighterdid not reveal this conflict of interest to me when suppressing the A-Tcourt-martialcharges.As in November 1988 the Judge Advocate General of the Army had secretly orderedthat the Army initiate a new criminal investigation of me based on A-T’sallegations, itwas obvious that an investigation into, and court-martial of A-T for falsifyingthosesame allegations was not going to be permitted.Despite the eventual, conspicuous, and ignominious failure of TJAG and the CIDtofabricate a case against Lilith and myself, any investigation into A-T’s actualviolationsof the UCMJ remained permanently prohibited.- 105 -Chapter 6: Geraldo, Jesse, and Behind-Closed-DoorsGeraldo Rivera’s “Satanism!” NBC SpecialIn 1988 both the United States Army and I could have done without GeraldoRivera.The Presidio of San Francisco “child abuse” episode, Larry A-T’s attack onLilith andmyself, and the consequent events and actions summarized in the preceding fivechapters hadn’t, of course, taken place in a social vacuum. Across the UnitedStates, aswell as overseas in such countries as the United Kingdom, “satanic ritual abuse”hysteria was continuing to rage, with new accusations against day-careproviders,babysitters, and family relatives a regular occurrence in the news.Unsurprisingly the tabloid media milked this cash cow enthusiastically. Thespirit ofMoloch prevailed. The more lurid the latest scandal, the more people could becountedupon to tune their televisions to it.Preeminent among the “satanism” fear-merchants was a new daytime televisiontalk-show host, Geraldo Rivera. Presenting himself as merely a concernedinvestigativejournalist, he was rather a sensationalist predecessor to the bottom-feeding,tabloid-trash television shows to come, such as that of Jerry Springer. By mid-1988Rivera’sdaytime shows were regularly presenting “victims of satanists”, “reformed ex-satanists”, “teen satanists”, “anguished parents of satanists”, “witnesses ofsataniccrimes”, and anything else invoking the dreaded S-word he and his publicistscouldentice in front of a camera. Ratings soared as audiences shuddered in delicioushorrorthat “such things were happening even in our own, normal Americanneighborhoods!”.Later that year Rivera announced his personal pièce de résistance: a two-hour,prime-time NBC television special on “Satanism”. I discussed this with theTemple ofSet in the October 1988 issue of its Scroll of Set newsletter:On October 25th Geraldo Rivera, he of Al Capone’s basement vault and thetreasuresof the Titanic, will be anchoring a two-hour NBC special report on Satanism intheUnited States. I have been invited to participate in the special as part of adiscussionpanel. The other members of the panel have not been finalized, but possiblenamesinclude Father James LeBar of New York City and Roy Masters.“Reverend” LeBar styles himself “Consultant of Cults for the Archdiocese of NewYork”. Under this title he operates a hate-group entitled the InterfaithCoalition ofConcern about Cults. I am surprised - perhaps I shouldn’t be - to see thefollowinginstitutions affiliated with it: Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North & SouthAmerica,Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, the Roman Catholic ArchdioceseofNew York, and the Council of Churches of the City of New York.LeBar actively disseminates a selection of distorted, disinformational sheetsconcerning Satanism and the Temple of Set similar to those disseminated by SandiGallant & Co. He never informed us that he was doing this, and of course neverasked us- 106 -for one of our informational statements. This past May, when I first learned ofhisfurtive little hate-campaign, I promptly sent him a letter taking him to taskfor hisbigotry. Of course there was no reply; such types operate only in the dark andwhenothers’ backs are turned.Roy Masters’ name is new to me. I understand that he is a Christianfundamentalist,operating in Los Angeles and Oregon, who specializes in “deliverances”[presumablyfrom demonic possession?]. Any Setian who knows anything about this individualisasked to send me as much information as possible as quickly as possible.The broadcast will also feature a live hook-up with the Oklahoma StatePenitentiary,where someone named Sean Sellers is serving a jail sentence, presumably for a“Satanic” crime. Again, any Setian who may have heard of this individual orknowsanything about him is requested to provide me with details as soon as possible.Scheduled also to be present at the penitentiary with Sellers is professionalex-Satanist Mike Warnke. I already know most of what I need to know about Warnke.Butagain, if any Setian has any current information concerning him or hisactivities, now isthe time to pass it along. [This article was written before the Lexington,Kentucky newsmedia exposed Warnke’s entire “Satanic” story as being a fabrication.]Anton LaVey has not responded to Rivera’s invitation to appear on the special.OnAugust 8th, however, a weird event took place in San Francisco that theproducers ofthe special witnessed and filmed:At the bottom of San Francisco’s “tenderloin” area - so-called because of theabundance of sex-shops, prostitutes, derelicts, and flophouses, is the StrandTheater.The Strand, located on Market Street, is a rather decrepit old movie house thatshows3rd- or 4th-run movies, an occasional oddball film festival (such as KennethAnger’sMagic Lantern Cycle), or a rental-event.The Strand was rented on 8/8/88 for what was billed as “An Evening ofApocalypticDelight: A Tribute to the Zodiac Killer”, consisting of the film The Other SideofMadness about the Manson Family, a Jonathan Reiss movie entitled A BitterMessageof Hopeless Grief, and a gig by a local rock band called “NON”, which I gatheris of thepunk/metal variety.One of the featured participants, apparently, was Zeena LaVey, the daughter ofAnton & Diane LaVey, who read some extracts from the Satanic Bible. Apparentlytherewere some black-clad teenagers in the audience waving the Sign of the Horns andhowling “Hail, Satan!” while this was going on, because the Geraldo team caughtit onfilm.This caused a minor furor in the Bay Area over the next several days, as anumber ofpeople in the audience who had merely come to see the show were not thrilledaboutbeing depicted on national television as “Satanic/Nazi” punk-rockers! Attorneyswereaccordingly engaged, and a Geraldo organization spokesman assured the indignantcitizens that no faces would be shown for whom signed releases had not beenobtained.There is a certain comic element in this, but what is of concern to me is theimpression that the Strand affair creates of the Church of Satan as a rathersleazyoperation. During its substantive operation from 1966 to 1975 it went about itsbusinessin a responsible and sophisticated fashion - which isn’t to say that it didn’tenjoy pulling- 107 -society’s leg on occasion. I am providing Rivera with some background materialtoillustrate the original Church’s - and Anton LaVey’s - actual depth.Concerning the NBC broadcast Rivera has said: “Whether or not you believe inSatan, there is no doubt that Satanism is a very real, widespread, and in manywaysdangerous phenomenon in this country. Jayne Mansfield and Sammy Davis, Jr. wereboth Satanists. Now Davis claims not to be, but we have photographs of him inworshipservices. And there’s lots more. It’s well into the tens of thousands.”Upon seeing this comment I have provided Rivera with some relevant facts toincrease the broadcast’s accuracy. Mansfield was certainly a Satanist, but thecase is abit different with Sammy Davis, Jr. Following the 1972 airing of his movie PoorDevil, Ipresented him with an honorary degree as a Warlock II° in the Church. It wasunderstood by Davis, myself, and Anton LaVey that this was a gesture ofappreciationfor his sensitive and tolerant portrayal of Satanism in the film - and was notintended to“convert” him from whatever personal religion he might hold.The honorary membership presented to Davis was known throughout the Church ofSatan, and of course he was welcomed by many Grottos and members of thePriesthoodduring his tours and travels. If he had his picture taken together with some ofthem, Idaresay it was more in the spirit of friendliness than in the performance offormal BlackMagic operations.This is not to say that Davis’ interest in the Church of Satan wasn’t sincere.It was.But it is fair to say that it was more a philosophical interest than an activelyritualistic orceremonial one.Rivera has also gone south to Los Angeles to look in on the notorious McMartinPreschool “Satanic child abuse” trial, which - incredibly! - is still grindingon after allthese years. In fact it is not anticipated to conclude until April of 1989.After the initial wave of mass accusations in that witch-hunt subsided, only twopeople are still under indictment: Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, PeggyMcMartin Buckey, 61.The Los Angeles Daily News reported on August 11th that attorneys for both theprosecution and defense were apprehensive about Rivera’s being filmed among thecourtroom spectators. I don’t know why, and I don’t really think the attorneysdo either- except that the “Satanism” accusations thrown around during the originalMcMartinscandal were so idiotic and absurd that recalling them to the public’s attentionin a“Satanism” news special can’t help making the continuing trial look all thatmuch moredeplorable.I have provided Rivera with extensive documentation concerning the continuingnational epidemic of “Satanic child abuse” witch-hunts created by the “industry”oftherapists and fundamentalist hate-groups. Perhaps he will use this opportunitytoreally put the torch to this obscene movement. It would take courage to do so,butRivera has shown on his daytime show that he is not afraid of speakingcontroversialand even unpopular truths. If he does in this instance, a great many past,present, andpotential future victims of the “child abuse industry” will be in his debt.Why did I agree to participate in this television special as a panelist? First,as HighPriest of the Temple of Set, I felt that I had an ex officio responsibility topublicly stand- 108 -up for our religion, particularly in what was evidently going to be one oftelevision’smost widely-watched specials in recent history. If the environment were biasedandhostile, I would simply have to do my best to make it less so.Secondly, Rivera said that he intended to include the Presidio episode. Theinferencewas clear: Either you accept my invitation to defend yourself, or you will be atthemercy of whoever else we can find to talk about you.Shortly before the special’s 10/25 taping in New York City, I wrote Rivera:I hope that you will indeed use this broadcast to clear up misinformationconcerningcontemporary Satanism. The preposterous stereotypes projected by the religiouslunaticfringe are already largely discredited among people who have taken the time toexaminethe facts. As with any other craze, it is simply a question of time until therest of thepublic realizes the extent of the distortions and malicious defamations whichhaveoccurred, and shrugs off the fad in disgust. Your broadcast can be the spearheadof thisexpose - or it can be one of the last efforts to prop up an already moribundhate-campaign. I hope that you will have the courage and the journalistic integrityto make itthe former.In your previous letter to me, you said that you would be asking my opinionsconcerning Sean Sellers and Mike Warnke.According to published accounts in the local media at the time of his crime, andper atelevised interview he gave to a Texas television station several months ago,there is noindication that Sean Sellers was ever part of an organized Satanic group whichencouraged or orchestrated the murders of which he was convicted.Sellers has stated that he was “trained” into Satanism by playing “Dungeons andDragons”. This makes about as much sense as being “trained” into Satanism byseeing ahorror movie. Children and adolescents habitually play any number of fantasygameswhile they grow up. I’m certain young Jerry Rivers [Rivera’s real name] did aswell. Didthey warp your soul or enslave you to the Devil? Well, they may have promptedyou tobecome an attorney, which is almost as bad. [Rivera had been a practicingattorneybefore career-changing into television.]Sellers has stated that, after being sucked into Satanism via “D&D”, he “becameavampire and had a craving for blood”. Obviously he is not a vampire, nor canhumansdrink blood without getting violently sick. Why should his claims about Satanicinvolvement be any more credible than those about his being Count Dracula?Sellers has stated that “every Satanist uses drugs”. In fact the Church of SatanandTemple of Set have consistently and adamantly insisted that their members stayclear ofillegal drugs. The occasional violator, when discovered, has been expelledunless it hasbeen verified that he or she is under corrective medical treatment.As a minor, Sellers was presumably brought up as a member of a conventionalchurch which, together with his parents and school, assumed responsibility forhismoral instruction and emotional development. If a religion is to be blamed forthemurders that he committed, it stands to reason that it should be the one whichindoctrinated him throughout his childhood, not one with which he had no formalconnection whatever.- 109 -While, like “Tod”, “Sam”, and “Kurt” on your 10/6/88 daytime show, Sellers spinsstories of a massive and clandestine “Satanic underground”, the same objectionarisesthat applies to all the other “accounts” of this nature - including that of theequally-pathetic “ex-Satanist Elaine” on your 11/19/87 daytime show. Despite all thehorrendous crimes in which these people claim to have been involved, and thelongassociations they claim with the many other people in the cults in question, noothermember of any such cult has ever been identified or prosecuted. Nor have any ofthe“escaped ex-Satanists” ever been prosecuted for the crime orgies in which theysay theywere involved (usually as leaders).As a Satanist for the last twenty years, I am well familiar with the lore andsymbolism of the religion in its many ritual and ceremonial applications. If anyof these“ex-Satanists” were recounting actual Satanic activities, I would recognize theterminology, the settings, and the procedures. Not one of them has demonstratedknowledge beyond the comic-book level. [I exposed one such “ex-Satanist” on theOprah Winfrey Show in just this way.]If a cult or gang were engaged in such serious crimes as regular human sacrifice(=murder), I seriously doubt that any participant would be allowed to just dropout andwaltz into the talk-show circuit. Despite your studio gimmicks such as screensandmasked faces, any such gang would have first-hand knowledge of a disaffectedmemberfrom the moment he or she ceased cooperating. Retaliation would presumably beimmediate. Yet there is no evidence that any of these “ex-Satanists” ever hadanydifficulty bowing out of a “murder ring”.I see Sellers as no different from any wrongdoer who is anxious to project theresponsibility for his deeds on to something - anything - else other thanhimself. “TheDevil made me do it” is the first act in this cliché, soft-shoe routine. Thesecond act isbeing Born Again, as per Susan Atkins and Charles Colson. [If you’ve alreadybeenreBorn once, as Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, then I guess you’ve got to goround asecond time.]My views concerning Mike Warnke are much the same as those concerning Sellers,save that Warnke isn’t a convicted murderer. Since he first surfaced in 1972 asstar ofMorris Cerullo’s traveling “Witch Wagon” revivalist road show, Warnke’s claimsabouthis “Satanic” past have come across like so much snake oil.Two evenings ago I listened to an extensive taped interview given by Warnke inwhich he claimed to have been a leader in a l,500-strong Devil-cult in the LosAngelesarea. The Church of Satan had members all over Los Angeles. If any otherSatanistgroup of this size, involved in either criminal or non-criminal activities, hadexisted, wewould have certainly known about it. There is no indication that any of thecrimesalleged to have been perpetrated by this large cult ever took place, or thatanyone fromit was ever identified or arrested, or that Warnke himself was arrested forhaving been aleader in it, or that he has ever suffered so much as a wart for having made aprofessionfor himself writing books and making media appearances about it. His book TheSatanSeller talks horrifically about this cult, but once again includes not onespecific item ofinformation which can be used to verify its existence.You already have the extensive documentation on the other subjects of your showwhich I have provided you by mail. Certainly you have enough data to know thatthe- 110 -“criminal conspiracy” image of Satanism projected by religious hate-groups issimplywrong - not in a few respects but in every respect.Satanism is a legitimate religion which has evolved through the years into arespectable, creative, and positive alternative for thoughtful individuals. Wedo notclaim it is suitable for everyone, but we think it deserves to be judged on itsown merits -not to be persecuted out of existence by bigots who fear that it might look moreattractive than the alternatives in which they have an emotional or financialstake.Are you going to suppress the truth about this, or are you going to reveal it?The show was indeed a hatchet job on Satanism, with Rivera using the S-word inanalarmist sense to characterize any and every sort of extreme criminal activity,ritual/non-ritual and real/imaginary. I had glumly expected this, but felt thatwhateverobjections & clarifications I could make would be better than none at all. As itturnedout, there was almost no time for any of the panelists or invited guests in theaudience(including Lilith) to talk, as Rivera filled most of the 2 hours withfilm-clips. But suchcomments as I was able to make were well-received, and Rivera himself wascourteousand respectful both on- and off-camera.Although the producers had also invited Anton LaVey to attend, he refused tocome -but did send his daughter Zeena in his stead. Under the circumstances she roseto thechallenge and handled herself well.Numerous reviews, as well as video of that special, can be Googled on theInternet.While immediately attracting a huge national viewing audience, it quickly cameundersevere criticism for its many exaggerations and falsehoods, resulting in aneventualpublic apology for it by the NBC president.In a subsequent letter of mine in answer to a correspondent who asked myimpressions of the broadcast at the time, I said:It is an accepted principle in Western society that legitimate churches have therightto define the religion they represent. Opponents of the religion or cranks donot havethat right.The first thing that I said to Rivera is thus the essence of the matter. Thecriminals,psychos, and assorted cranks that were shown on the filmclips were not and arenotSatanists, but rather the failures and wreckage of the other moral and religioussystemsin which they were raised and educated.Rivera’s use of the term “Satanism” as a theme for this special merely harksback toNazi Germany, when it was fashionable to label all crime as “Jewish”. For awhiletheNazis went through the motions of distinguishing “good Jews” and “bad Jews” -theimplication being that some people could have some redeeming qualities despitethegeneral contamination of their religion. The most that I can say for Rivera isthat hesingled out the Temple of Set and Church of Satan as “good Jews”.Judging from feedback the Temple of Set has received - a surge in membershipinquiries and not a single piece of hate mail - the viewer public seem to havecome tothe same conclusion and rejected the show’s propaganda. I think that thisreflects wellupon the good sense of the citizenry.- 111 -Senator Jesse Helms (1)Well, not all of the citizenry, unfortunately. Jesse Helms, the notoriouslyreactionarySenator from North Carolina, saw the broadcast and was instantly enraged that aUnited States Army Lt. Colonel should actually dare to espouse a Satanicreligion.This was not Helms’ first attack on Satanism. In September 1985 he had quietlyintroduced an amendment into the 1986 Congressional budget bill. This Amendment#705 read:No funds appropriated under this act shall be used to grant, maintain, or allowtaxexemption to any cult, organization, or other group that has as a purpose orthat has anyinterest in the promoting of satanism or witchcraft: provided that for purposesof thissection, “satanism” is defined as the worship of Satan or the powers of evil and“witchcraft” is defined as the use of powers derived from evil spirits, the useof sorcery,or the use of supernatural powers with malicious intent.The effect of this legislation, if passed, would have been to strip federal, andhencestate, tax-exempt status as a religion from religious institutions such as theTemple ofSet and various neopagan/witchcraft groups. It was this status which formalized,wherethe U.S. government was concerned, a particular religion’s right to berecognized assuch in terms of First and Fourteenth Amendment Constitutional protections.Helmswasn’t interested in whether donations were tax-deductible; he wanted Satanismandwitchcraft outlawed.Despite a major Helms-sponsored letter-writing campaign in support of #705, itwasstripped out of the budget bill in committee, other legislators feeling that itwas tooblatantly unConstitutional.Now Senator Helms was determined to save America’s armed forces from the Devil.He instructed his Legislative Assistant to contact the Secretary of the Armyforthwith:Jesse HelmsNorth CarolinaUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510October 26, 1988The Honorable John O. Marsh, Jr.Secretary of the ArmyDear Secretary Marsh:I am writing first as a citizen of the great nation of ours and secondly as anemployeeof our federal government, concerning a cancer in the military, specifically acancerwithin the Army.Last evening I viewed a program hosted by Geraldo Rivera on Satanism andWitchcraft. I was appalled to learn that a Colonel Aquino of the United StatesArmy wasa founder of the Temple of Set, a satanic cult. I believe he is stationed in St.Louis.- 112 -To my view, this is disheartening. Here is a military man who has taken an oathtodefend God and country who practices a religion that is completely contrary tothe oathhe swore to uphold. If you or any member of your staff saw this telecast I amconfidentyour reaction was identical to mine.This individual should not be allowed to remain in the Army, his militaryservicerecord notwithstanding. I am respectful of any individual’s right to his firstamendmentprerogatives to worship. However, I cannot believe the Constitution is intendedtoprotect those individuals who have a belief system that espouses the killing andsacrificeof infants and the ritual torturing of children.I would appreciate your looking into the existence of satanic worship in theArmyand it’s [sic] adherents. Perhaps it may be necessary to hold Congressionalhearings toconsider appropriate legislation in this matter.Kindest regards,Sincerely,/s/ Wayne Ronald Boyles, IIILegislative Assistant to Senator Jesse HelmsBehind Closed Doors (1)On 11/2/88 the Department of the Army instituted Tasking Control Document#8811318Z concerning Helms’ letter. Action Officer was initially SALL (Secretaryof theArmy Legislative Liaison), who briefed Secretary Marsh 11/4/88:Expresses concern about his learning that an Army officer, featured on a recenttalkshow on Satanism and Witchcraft, was the founder of the Temple of Set, a sataniccult.Asks that this matter be looked into.On 11/8/88 Secretary Marsh personally tasked the “matter” to the Judge AdvocateGeneral of the Army, with a handwritten comment to additional addressees theArmyChief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff, General Counsel, Director of the ArmyStaff, andCriminal Investigation Command: “What do we do about this? /s/ M”Interestingly this staffing directive went to the Army’s legal and criminalstaff, not -as would be appropriate in the case of a religion inquiry, to the Chief ofChaplains (whowas not even info-copied). As far as Secretary Marsh was concerned, the Templeof Setwas not entitled to the dignity of an actual religion; instead it was assumed tobe oflegal/criminal concern. Nor, of course, did either Helms or anyone at theDepartmentof the Army think to ask me about any of this, nor even alert me to thecorrespondence. I was, of course, only a telephone call away in my Army ARPERCENoffice in St. Louis. 116Upon receiving his copy of Marsh’s memo, the Director of the Army Staff assumedthe action responsibility and memoed his assistant:116 I obtained copies of these documents only years later, through FOIA/PAfilings and lawsuitDiscovery.- 113 -Department of the Army8 November 1988To: Colonel Williams1. For action.a. Task out.b. I need an IPR117 on this.c. The IPR should be the same group that met earlier.2. This is a difficult area./s/ KClaude M. KicklighterLt. General, GSDirector of the Army StaffThis is the same General Kicklighter who would subsequently be reassigned asCommanding General of the U.S. Army’s Western Command and who in that capacity,in April 1990, would prevent the second court-martial charges against A-T fromproceeding to investigation and trial [see Chapter #5].The tasking went to the Judge Advocate General, who on 11/10/88 reported back toKicklighter that the IPR “will include TJAG, DCSPER, OCAR, OCLL, PA, DACH, andM&RA. 118 Target dates for presentation are 21 or 22 November.” 119On 11/23/88 the JAG responded to the DAS with an “Information Paper” for theimpending IPR, reproduced here as Appendix #42. In addition to its numerousfactualerrors, two aspects stand out about this paper:(1)The Army officer who was the subject of it was neither informed about it,invited to contribute to/proof it, nor attend the meeting. This amounted to aserious violation of Army personnel procedure, according to whichall actions concerning evaluation or proposed actions concerning any soldierare required to be only through properly-authorized and constituted boards.(2)My religious affiliation, and my presence in the Army while holding it, wasaddressed as a “problem to be solved”, expressly including ways to eliminateme at least from active duty, if not indeed from the Army altogether. Clearlynot on the table was the Constitutionally-mandated option of simply leavingme alone, leaving my religion alone, and both publicly and within theDepartment of the Army refusing to compromise this mandate.117 In-Progress Report.118 = The Judge Advocate General, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel,Office of the Chief or theArmy Reserve, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, Public Affairs, Chiefof Chaplains, and Morale& Recreation Activities (!?).119 Memorandum, author’s name blacked out on FOIA copy, Office of the Chief ofStaff, 11/10/88. Amajor portion of this memo was also blacked out on the FOIA copy.- 114 -The IPR meeting finally took place on 11/29/88. However not mentioned in eitherthe pre-meeting Information Paper nor in any supplement to it, nor in any recordofthe meeting itself as provided to me under FOIA/PA was the fact that the JudgeAdvocate General had already on 11/23/88 initiated a new criminal investigationofme on the basis of A-T’s allegations. [These actions within TJAG are discussedin detailin Chapter #7.] Thus several days before the supposedly-top-level meeting whichwasto decide “what to do about me”, General Overholt had already made its agendairrelevant by fiat. In view of the seniority and parity of the other meetingparticipants,he would presumably have taken this preemptory action only by direction and withexpress approval of higher authority, in this case Secretary of the Army Marshper hispersonal tasking of Overholt on 11/8/88 [see above].I learned about the 11/29/88 IPR meeting only in June 1989, seven months later,through FOIA/PA references to it, and promptly sent TJAG a FOIA/PA demand forit.Also assuming General Kicklighter to still be DAS, I then wrote to him asconveningofficial:August 31, 1989Dear General Kicklighter:On November 29, 1988 an In-Progress Report on the subject of the Satanicreligionwas held in the Pershing Conference Room by your decision. Under the Freedom ofInformation Act and Privacy Act, both in my capacity as an individual soldierand in mycapacity as chief executive officer of the Temple of Set, an incorporatedSatanic church,I request copies of all papers presented at, all minutes taken at, and alldecisions,directives, and items of correspondence resulting from that meeting.As the nation’s senior military officer representing the Satanic religion inofficialcapacity, I am surprised that I was neither invited to participate in thismeeting notoffered the opportunity to provide an informational paper to it. The result wasameeting to discuss a particular legitimate American religion without anyrepresentationby or input from that religion.The office of the Chief of Chaplains is not qualified to fulfill eitherfunction, as theCorps of Chaplains embraces only Christian and Jewish officials whosemetaphysicalassumptions and theological backgrounds are quite different from those ofSatanists.The only handbook on the subject published for chaplains, DA Pam #165-13 (April1978), had to be contracted out to the Institute for the Study of AmericanReligions at atime when ISAR itself knew little about the subject. We have since been in touchwithISAR, and have contributed accurate material about our religion to itsEncyclopædia ofAmerican Religion, I might add.Since I “dared” to defend my integrity and that of my religion on a GeraldoRiverabroadcast which was designed to slander it, I have unfortunately become therecipientof official discrimination and persecution within the Army. Some of this may bedue toindividual prejudice and disregard for the law. Some of it, however, may be duetoRivera-type misinformation being circulated about me, about the Temple of Set,and/orabout the Satanic religion generally. It is my responsibility as the seniorSatanist in theArmed Forces not only to ensure that my own Constitutional rights and those ofour- 115 -church are respected, but also to ensure that the rights, safety, and careers ofthe manycommissioned and enlisted members of all of the Armed Forces who are Satanistsarenot jeopardized in violation of the law.I would very much appreciate your understanding of the constructive intent of myrequest, and your providing the maximum possible information to me accordingly.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceI never received a response to this letter from General Kicklighter (a violationof thelegal requirements of the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act). On10/30/89 Ireiterated my FOIA/PA demand to his successor as DAS, Lt. General Ellis D.Parker,and only this time was informed by TJAG that my original FOIA/PA demand to DASwould be honored. 120Here I may note for the reader that I had quickly realized that multiple FOIA/PAdemands to each office, official, or agency identified with a relevant piece ofinformation would sometimes yield significantly more results, as recipient Awould beunaware of what recipient B had decided to conceal from me. Such are the perilsoflarge bureaucracies trying to conceal rats in the woodpile, as it were.By this time readers will also have noticed my habit of sending copies of everyfactual or FOIA/PA demand letter of mine to a great many Department of the Armysenior officers. This was not for either advertisement or drama, butdeliberately to denyall such recipients “deniability” of any illegal actions being committed againstLilithand myself. As mentioned in Chapter #5, the UCMJ prohibits not only falseofficialstatements under Article #133, but any action in either obstruction of justiceorconcealment of a crime (“misprision of serious offense”) under Article #134.While itwas highly unlikely that all of these distinguished addressees would actuallyface court-martial under #133/#134, I daresay the more they officially knew, the lesscomfortablethey felt about complicity in their continued silence.What I eventually received now were copies of the pre-meeting “InformationPaper” (Appendix #42) and some of the pre-meeting memoranda here quoted. Some ofthe memoranda contents were heavily blacked-out. No list was provided to me ofpapers not sent (also required by the FOIA/PA). Most conspicuously, noafter-actionreport of the meeting’s results was provided. For an IPR involving so manyseniorofficers at Department of the Army level, such a report was mandatory. What wasI notallowed to see? Obviously the decisions made concerning “what to do about me”,which, if they were thus kept secret, were improper and illegal. That suchdecisionswere in fact taken and implemented will also become quite evident in thechapters tocome.120 Letter, Colonel William J. Lehman, TJAG, to Michael Aquino 11/14/89.- 116 -Also denied to me was a specific list of just which officers had been present attheIPR meeting. On 10/10/89, in a response to an earlier FOIA/PA demand of mine,TJAG wrote:A number of draft documents are being withheld from you in their entirety,although the final version of most of these documents is being or has beenreleased toyou. Ten other documents are also being withheld from you in their entirety. Thedocuments consist of predecisional internal advice, recommendations, andsubjectiveevaluations, release of which could potentially cause governmental harm byrevealingthe deliberative process. The basis for withholding the documents is FOIAexemption 5(5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5); AR 340-17, paragraph 3-200 No. 5).You will note that names and addresses have been deleted from several of thedocuments being released to you. This information has been deleted to protectthepersonal privacy of individuals other than yourself. The basis for withholdingtheinformation is FOIA exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6); AR 340-17, paragraph 3-200No.6) ...There are several pieces of paper in two attorneys’ files which are handwrittennotesto themselves. These are being considered the personal records of thoseattorneys, andare not being released to you because only agency records, not personal records,aresubject to the FOIA. 121That was not at all satisfactory to me. I wrote back to the Secretary of theArmy:October 17, 1989Dear Sir:On October 16, 1989 I received the enclosed packet of papers from the DA JudgeAdvocate General’s Administrative Law Division. I also enclose a copy of theoriginalletter of mine to which this packet is a response. I hereby appeal ColonelLehman’sletter as follows:Paragraph #2: I hereby appeal all of the decisions to withhold the documentsidentified as being withheld from me. A review of the papers provided in thepacketestablishes a clear pattern of intentional, illegal, and prejudicialdiscriminationagainst my religion and my personal freedom to practice it as provided by theFirst andFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The withholding of additional papersinwhich officials of the government provide “predecisional internal advice,recommendations, and subjective evaluations” which, because of their prejudicialnature, violate the Constitution, cannot conceivably be supported on the mereexcuse that the revelation of such papers would “cause governmental harm”.Agenciesand officials of the United States Government have no “right” to conceal theirviolationof the laws they are sworn to uphold. To the contrary, the government and thepeople ofthe United States are harmed by the concealing of such prejudice at highgovernmental levels, which permits it to continue in future instances.121 Letter, Colonel William J. Lehman, TJAG, to Michael Aquino 10/10/89.- 117 -Paragraph #3: I appeal the denial of all names and addresses to me. Because ofthiscampaign of innuendo against my religion, my church, my wife, and myself, adeliberately fraudulent and prejudicial criminal investigation was initiatedagainst meby the U.S. Army CID. To expose this fraudulent investigation it is necessaryfor me toidentify all persons who may have contributed to it by administrativelyprejudicing theoutcome, by making false and malicious allegations, or by otherwise compromisingtheobjectivity of the Army’s investigative procedures in this case. Such attemptsto corruptthe investigation, to the extent that they constitute deliberate concealment ofthe truth,constitute acts of misprision of serious offense and obstruction of justice inviolation ofArticle #134 UCMJ. Protection of the personal privacy of individuals who mayhavecommitted crimes cannot be used as justification for concealing those crimes.Paragraph #6: I appeal the denial of the attorneys’ notes again on the groundsthat,to the extent they may identify the attorneys as acting or giving advice inviolation of theConstitution, they constitute important evidence of the nature of the deliberatecampaign of defamation undertaken against me. If these are U.S. governmentattorneys,then their making of notes to themselves in support of a government assignment,ongovernment time, in government offices, and on government salary clearlyestablishesthat those notes and all other papers of theirs involved with the assignment,aregovernment property. I may cite the example of President Nixon’s “personal”tapes asan example; these have been clearly held to be government property despite hisclaimthat they should have been privileged as “personal memoranda for his memoirs”.Paragraph #7. I request a list of all documents contained in the JAG files whichwere generated by the CID and/or the Personnel Security Branch, and which havebeenreferred to these agencies for FOIA/PA action. This is important so that I mayfollow upto see if these agencies do in fact comply with the law concerning the releaseof thismaterial to me, and also so that I may identify precisely what documents theseagenciesfelt it appropriate to provide to the JAG for its files. Provision of suchdocuments to theJAG for separate files, if a clear justification for such provision cannot bedemonstrated,may constitute a violation of applicable provisions of the Privacy Act and otherlawspreventing the creation and maintenance of unofficial, defamatory dossierswithin thegovernment.In my 6/5/89 letter to which Colonel Lehman’s letter is in answer, I requestedanofficial statement describing precisely what is meant by the phrase “to dealwith him”. Iam not aware of any license which the Army has to take action against anysoldiersimply because he may be exercising his Constitutionally-guaranteed right tofreedomof religion. I restate my request for an explanation why such language as “todeal withhim and other Army members who practice Satanic worship” was consideredappropriate. I presume that the Army does not “deal with Jews”, for example.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceEnclosures:• Letter, Lt.Col.

You have appealed the partial denial of yourrequestunder the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act (PA). Yourequestedcopies of all documents maintained by the Office of The Judge Advocate General(OTJAG) pertaining to you or the Temple of Set. That office partially deniedyourrequest on October 10, 1989.You received all requested information except for draft versions of finaldocumentsthat were released to you, personal notes of attorneys in OTJAG, andpredecisionalmaterial. OTJAG also redacted the names and addresses of numerous third partiestoprotect their personal privacy. Upon review, we have determined that theremainder ofthe documents were properly withheld under Exemptions 5 and 6 of the FOIA.Therefore, we deny your appeal.Draft and predecisional documents have been withheld under Exemption 5 of theFOIA, 5 U.S.C. section 552(b)(5), which protects from disclosure inter- orintra-agencymemoranda that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency inlitigation with the agency. Specifically, this information is withheld under the“deliberative process privilege,” the general purpose of which is to preventinjury to thequality of agency decisions.Exemption 6 of the FOIA authorizes the withholding of information when itsdisclosure would result in a “clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”5 U.S.C.section 552(b)(6). To determine whether release of the requested informationconstitutes such an invasion of privacy, we must balance any qualifying publicinterestin disclosure against the privacy interests in withholding the document atstake. In thiscase, there appears to be no public interest in the release of the names oraddresses,particularly of constituents who have exercised their Constitutional right topetitionCongress. On the other hand, release of this information could lead toharassment of the- 119 -named individuals and would invade their protectable privacy interests.Therefore,names and addresses have been redacted. See Department of Justice v. ReportersCommittee for Freedom of the Press, 109 S. Ct. 1468(1959). 122As noted above, the documents you requested included the personal notes of OTJAGattorneys. Because these notes were created and used solely by the preparer,were notcirculated, and were not filed with Army records, these notes are not agencyrecords. Aspersonal notes, they are not subject to release or access under the FOIA or thePA,respectively.In accordance with Army policy, records originating within CriminalInvestigationCommand and the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence areconsideredrecords of those offices, not OTJAG, and were referred to those offices for areleasedetermination. OTJAG notified you of these referrals. The fact of referral isnot a propersubject for appeal.Finally, you asked for an explanation of certain terminology contained in the 23November 1988 Information Paper provided in response to your request. As norecordsexist that are responsive to this portion of your request, this issue is notsubject toappeal under the FOIA. See Army Regulation 340-17, paragraph 5-300a.This letter constitutes final action on behalf of the General Counsel, who hasbeendesignated by the Secretary of the Army to consider appeals under the FOIA. Youmay,if you so desire, seek judicial review of this determination in accordance withthe FOIAprovisions.Sincerely,/s/ Darrell L. PeckDeputy General Counsel (Military/Civil Affairs)So that was as far as the FOIA/PA would take me in this inquiry.Senator Jesse Helms (2)We now return to December 1988. TJAG had secretly initiated its criminalinvestigation of me on 11/25/88, and the secret 11/29/88 IP meeting had beenheld.

Yesterday in goingthrough astack of material sent to me in Raleigh, I ran across a December 27 clippingfrom TheWashington Times123 about a Lt. Col. Michael Aquino who identifies himself as a“Satanist” and who claims that this is his “religion”.Either the man needs psychiatric help, or the Army doesn’t need him.

Brown decided to share his own thoughts withNBC inDecember 1988. Because of the length of this letter, it appears here as Appendix#40.I did not learn of the existence of this letter for another six months, by whichtimeGeneral Brown had been replaced by General Robert RisCassi. I accordingly wroteRisCassi the letter at Appendix #41. No response.By this time I was becoming quite tired of seeing mis/disinformation concerningtheTemple of Set, myself, and the Setian/Satanic religion generally circulated byhigh-levelArmy officials. Accordingly I wrote to General Carl Vuono, Chief of Staff of theArmyand its seniormost officer:June 2, 198Dear Sir:The enclosed letter from Major General Ward discusses documents concerning mewhich have been withheld from me under my FOIA request because they are notes inpreparation for an In-Process Review for you.Many documents containing significantly erroneous information concerning myselfand my religion have been circulating throughout the Department of the Army inthelast few years.

As anexample Ienclose a copy of the letter written to the President of NBC by the former ViceChief ofStaff on your letterhead, together with my letter of this date to GeneralRisCassicorrecting the misinformation therein.While I do not ask you to provide me with copies of informal notes concerningmyself, I do request that, before making any decision based upon them, youadvise meof any statements or purported facts contained therein, so that I may eitherconfirm orcorrect them as appropriate.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceNo answer was forthcoming, nor did the Army ever respond to my requests to theVice Chief and Chief of Staff to check proposed official statements concerningtheSetian/Satanic religion with me before issuing them.- 125 -Implications of Information Presented in this ChapterThe San Francisco Police Department’s investigation of A-T’s allegationsconcerningLilith and myself quickly established our innocence; we were verified to be3,000 milesaway in Washington, D.C. on all dates when Kinsey had been left with Hambrightat thePresidio day-care center. When that investigation was closed in August 1988, theArmyconsidered it over with. Simultaneously the Army had suppressed anyinvestigation oraccountability of A-T for instigating it.While the entire episode might have ended there, it was dragged back intonational,and the Army’s, attention by the sensationalistic Geraldo Rivera “Satanism” NBCtelevision special in October 1988. This elicited a storm of public complaint totheCongress about an Army Lt. Colonel being a Satanist, as well as two especiallyvehement demands for my termination by Senator Jesse Helms, a reactionary butinfluential personal friend of Secretary of the Army John Marsh.Marsh tasked the Judge Advocate General of the Army, Major General Overholt, to“do something about me”. As my service record was, in TJAG’s own words,“superlative”, the only possible way to force me out of the Army was toresurrect the A-T allegations, which TJAG so did on 11/23/88 by initiating a new CID/TJAGinvestigation.From the SFPD investigation (closed almost four months before on 8/1/88), theCID/TJAG had full knowledge of our innocence, but assumed that the pressure andpublicity of a revived criminal investigation would intimidate me, and frightenmy wife,into resigning my commission [as would be explicitly recommended to me by CID/TJAG investigators]. Failing that, the investigation could be [and was] used toillegallyremove me from the full-time AGR program, returning me at least to the part-timeReserve. From the outset of the sham investigation, no actual court-martialchargeswere ever contemplated.Summarily the Secretary of the Army had decided that, whatever my service recordand however good an officer I might be, my religion simply made me more of aliabilitythan an asset. Since that religion was Constitutionally protected, some otherway had tobe found to get rid of me, and the A-T allegations were the only “other way”possible.During the entire November 1988 timeframe, when these decisions were being madein the Pentagon, I knew nothing whatever of them. No questions were asked of me,nosuggestions invited. Since an illegal course of action was being undertaken inorder to“deal with me”, I was obviously to be treated as an “external target”, notrespected as afellow professional soldier with a shared interest in the good of the Army.- 126 -Chapter 7: The CID/TJAG “Reinvestigation”On 12/13/88 I was suddenly informed that my Army personnel records had beenflagged. 128 Learning that this was on the initiative of the San Francisco FieldOffice ofthe CID, I immediately telephoned that office and was connected to its head,SpecialAgent Robert Birck. He said that a “preliminary investigation” had been open onmesince August 1987, that this had been closed out with a “final report” on11/22/88, andon the basis of that report he personally decided to open a full-scale criminalinvestigation of me.As I would gradually verify over the next year, none of this was true: Nodocumentsfrom or referring to any such “preliminary investigation” or its “11/22/88 finalreport”were ever identified by or obtained from under FOIA/PA demands or later federallawsuit Discovery from the SFPD, FBI, TJAG, or the CID. My Top Secret securityclearance had not been suspended [as any CID criminal investigation wouldrequire],nor had my personnel file been flagged. These actions only happened on 11/23/88.And was the decision to initiate an actual investigation on 11/23/88 reallyBirck’s? Ifa matter has garnered such attention that the Secretary of the Army and a numberofthe Army chiefs at the 2-. 3-, and 4-star level are conferring about it, itsfurther courseof resolution is assuredly not going to be personally decided by a mere CIDspecialagent out in a local field office. Clearly Birck just said and did as he wastold by TJAGthrough his CID chain of command, period.The timing was of course significant: a short time following the Geraldo showand itsaggravating public-relations aftermath. But Birck’s statement about purely-localjustification rang very false indeed. If, as Birck was now claiming, the SFCIDhad takenA-T’s allegations seriously at the time he made them, it would have beenobligated toopen a formal investigation and flag my records right then in August 1987,regardless of what the SFPD might be doing. An officer genuinely under suspicionofthe horrific crimes Chaplain A-T alleged would never be allowed to continue hiscareerflag-free, with highest-level security clearance, and without the formalrestrictions of aCID investigation, for another 1-1/3 years.Also the SFPD investigation had been formally closed on 8/1/88. If the SFCID forsome obscure reason felt that it didn’t need to formalize its own investigationas long asthe SFPD was conducting one, then why - again in the case of such a seriousallegation -wait for almost four months before taking action?“Birck’s” 11/23/88 decision traveled to TJAG headquarters in Washington so fastthat on the very same date Lt. Colonel Stephen J. Smith of TJAG’s Criminal LawDivision sent a letter to the Assistant Judge Advocate for Military Law statingthat128 “Flagging” means suspension of all possible favorable personnel actions,such as awards,promotions, schooling, etc. while the flag is in effect.- 127 -“LTC Michael A. Aquino, the avowed Satanist129 , would be titled for kidnapping,sodomy, conduct unbecoming an officer, urging the court-martial of anotherwithoutbasis, and conspiracy. The titling determination was based on a review ofevidencepreviously gathered by the CID, the FBI, and the City of San Francisco.” 130All of this was simply another lie:As noted above, the CID had previously gathered no evidence, conducted noinvestigation, written no report.As for the FBI, it had washed its hands of the A-T allegations on 9/30/87, whenitspublic spokesman, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello announced at a pressconferencein San Francisco that “after a lengthy investigation, his office in conjunctionwith theFBI had concluded that Mr. Hambright had acted alone and there were no co-perpetrators. He further stated that there would be no other arrests inconnection withthe Presidio day-care center. Colonel Joseph Rafferty, Presidio Commander, wasatpresent and echoed Russoniello’s statements.” 131As for the San Francisco Police Department, it had formally ended itsinvestigationon 8/1/88 with Deputy District Attorney Michael Williams announcing that therewas“insufficient evidence to prosecute” Lilith or myself concerning the story whichhe[inaccurately] attributed to Kinsey A-T instead of her stepfather. 132 Alsonoteworthyhere are SFPD chief investigator Glenn Pamfiloff’s comments to me on 4/19/2000,quoted in full in Chapter #4:You must remember that I worked with most of those investigating you. You seemtowant to break down every little iota to its nexus, but I want to try to keep itat its mostbasic. “No evidence against you” doesn’t need to be answered with specifics.If no other children, of the 100+ interviewed identified you, nor any of thechildrenidentified your home, as a respected child abuse investigator I would have toassume,that you were not involved with these children.This is the entire point of my contacting you.I’m sure that if you were the evil man that so much of the media makes you outto be,especially with your notoriety, at least one of “Dr.Lt.Col.’s” children wouldhaveattributed some nefarious act to you.129 If, as the CID/TJAG would exhaustively claim, my religion was not a factorin this decision orinvestigation, why was it appropriate to make special mention of it here?130 “Titling” is a formal statement by the CID that it thinks a given crime hastaken place. It is issuedtentatively at the onset of an investigation and may or may not be finallystated at its conclusion.“Titling” is not comparable to a civilian indictment, however: no arrest is madeand no chargespreferred.131 Letter, Bernard Zimmerman (Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro) to SFPD Chief FrankJordan 8/2/87.132 “Army Officer’s Case is Dropped”, San Francisco Chronicle 8/2/88.- 128 -Well, I found no evidence, other than the first, very doubtful identification ofyou atthe PX, and the very stretched identifications within your home, and a few, verystretched relationships, that in anyway could find you guilty of any childabuse.My hope is to put this information into the public sector, to clear you of anyrelationship with Mr. Hambright, of which my investigation found none, and toclearyou of any involvement with the children of the Presidio Day Care Center.Hence there was no “previously gathered evidence for sodomy, kidnapping, orconspiracy”. As for “urging the court-martial of another without basis”, onewondershow the SFCID could determine this when it declined to investigate any of theelementsof those charges at all, recommended dismissing those charges in disregard ofthoseelements, and did its utmost to cover up its actions in those regards for 1-1/2years [seeChapter #5].Nor could the CID possibly cite any “conduct unbecoming an officer” concerningme, as all I had done was, through proper channels and always in accordance withArmy Regulations, to insist that my wife and I had committed no crime whatever,andto formally request that the officer who had maliciously lied about this be heldofficiallyaccountable for those lies.Notwithstanding the above inconvenient details, Major General William K. Suter,the Assistant Judge Advocate General at Department of the Army, rushed to informhisboss General Overholt:- 129 -Routing and Transmittal Slip25 November 1988To: TJAG1.

SuterMajor General, USAThe Assistant Judge Advocate GeneralA remarkably busy and exciting day for General Suter just because of a “suddendecision” by a lowly field agent at the lowest level of field office in theentire CID.But such lofty intrigues were unknown to me at the time [and would remain so inthis detail for years]; the significant thing was that this CID investigationhad beenopened.I promptly asked my PM&S attorney Shawn Hanson to follow up. On 12/14/88Captain Mark W. Harvey, Judge Advocate of the 6th Region CID, sent him a lettercontaining a number of questions for me to answer:If LTC Aquino is willing to waive his rights and discuss the offenses underinvestigation, with the assistance of counsel, let me first begin by commentingthat ifLTC Aquino has not committed these offenses, USACIDC hopes to establish hisinnocence, and assist in clearing his name. USACIDC’s responsibility is todiscover theevidence so that it can be determined whether a crime has been committed, and ifpossible identify the person(s) that committed the crime. LTC Aquino’s statementwill133 Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, General RisCassi [see Chapter #6].134 Director of the Army Staff, Lt.

LTCAquino’s cooperation with this investigation will also be documented withinUSACIDCfiles.Further, if LTC Aquino provides certain leads or evidence that shows theallegationsto be without merit, I will insure that USACIDC personnel follow those leads, tothemaximum possible extent, in order to properly document his innocence.I had decidedly mixed feelings about Harvey’s honeyed promises. While I wantedvery much to trust his professionalism, integrity, and word, I had not forgottenthat itwas this same 6th Region/San Francisco Field Office CID which had deliberatelyactedto quash the court-martial charges I had preferred against A-T with a token“report ofinvestigation” ignoring all its elements of proof. On 1/1/89, therefore, I wrotetoHarvey:Dear Captain Harvey:Mr. Shawn Hanson of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro has provided me with a copy ofyour December 14th letter to him.While you can expect my full cooperation with any objective investigationdesignedto establish the truth about the Presidio child-care scandal, I will not lendanylegitimacy whatever to a biased investigation designed to conceal the truth, toframeinnocent people for crimes which never occurred, and to facilitate thedefrauding of theUnited States Government for $66 million. The way in which this investigationproceeds from this point forward will indicate to me, and to many otherobservers,which one of the two kinds of investigations is actually taking place.If this investigation of me were honestly and ethically opened, I can onlysupposethat it is because the CID has only an incomplete and confusing picture of theentiresequence of pertinent events to date, and that - as you stated in your letter toMr.Hanson - you are accordingly interested in ensuring that you have a complete andclearpicture. The documents I am enclosing will enable you to do that. There shouldthen beno reason not to terminate the investigation of me without delay, to remove theflag onmy personnel file, and to restore my security clearance. Mrs. Aquino and I havenowbeen investigated, vandalized, harassed, and threatened for well over a yearbecause ofAdams-Thompson’s attack on us, and we have had quite enough of it.I have several misgivings concerning this latest in the series ofinvestigations:(1) As the enclosed historical documents show, it very quickly came to lightthatChaplain Adams-Thompson’s allegations against my wife and myself were utterlywithout foundation. It takes no “great leap of faith” to see this; the facts areclear andconspicuous for any intelligent individual to appreciate, and have beencarefully andexhaustively presented many times. Nevertheless the CID is now opening this newinvestigation based once more upon those allegations, as if the facts provingthem falsesimply do not exist at all.(2) Based on stories which have recently appeared in the San Francisco Chronicleand San Jose Mercury News West, CID investigators and spokespersons have beenmaking statements to Presidio parents and to the media that a crime was indeedcommitted and I have already been “titled” for it, with the necessaryimplication being- 131 -that this investigation is merely a going-through-the-motions exercise with itsoutcomepredetermined before it began. Particularly in view of the hysterical, “lynchmob”climate of the Presidio scandal, such statements are highly prejudicial,encourage themanufacture of allegations by anyone hoping to benefit in the $66 million claimsactionagainst the U.S. Army, further endanger the personal safety of my wife andmyself, andimpugn my professional and personal reputation as an officer.(3) Although Adams-Thompson’s allegations were shown to be without any basiswhatever, and I am thus entitled to the same presumption of non-involvement inthescandal as any other soldier, I am nonetheless being uniquely singled out forcontinuedtreatment as a “suspect” in the Presidio scandal generally, evidently for noother reasonthan my religion (which neither advocates nor tolerates any crimes againstchildren).The reference in your letter to “children” (plural) and the questions you sentwhichrange far beyond the date of Adams-Thompson’s original allegations clearlyindicatesuch a fishing expedition. I see the classic signs of a witch-hunt, in which, ifone allegedcrime is disproven, other allegations are quickly manufactured in order tosomehowjustify the original attack and “get” the individual.(4) As the enclosed “paper trail” shows, from the very first day I first learnedofAdams-Thompson’s attack on my wife and myself, I moved methodically through theappropriate procedures established by the Army to correct injustices - from aletter toAdams-Thompson personally, to requests for non-judicial corrective action by hiscommanders, to UCMJ charges as appropriate. What I have seen in response is ayear-long pattern of the deliberate sheltering of Adams-Thompson from accountabilityforhis vicious actions, apparently because he is a Christian minister in the CorpsofChaplains and I am a Satanist, and that for public relations purposes the Armywill notconsider court-martialing a Christian minister on behalf of a Satanist, nomatter whatharm the minister did to him and his wife.(5) Further, according to your letter, the very fact that I “dared” to ask thatAdams-Thompson be called to account for his attack under the UCMJ, as it is the rightof everywronged soldier to request, is now itself being used to threaten and intimidatemefurther - by allegations that I prepared a false charge sheet and lied in theswornstatements in support of it. The facts and reasoning in those sworn statementsareprima facie the truth, and they support the charge sheet accordingly. Noobjectiveanalysis can lead to any other conclusion.As I look at these five general aspects of this investigation, I do not see afair,objective, and non-prejudicial picture at all. This is not the way Americanjustice issupposed to be administered, and it is not the way the United States Army issupposedto conduct investigations either. In my 19-year career as a commissionedofficer, I havefrequently been an investigating officer, presided in Article 32B inquiries, andserved insummary, special, and general courts-martial capacities. I know the differencebetweena search for the truth and its concealment, and I know the difference between anobjective investigation and a prejudicial one. I have never tolerated the latterin the caseof any other soldier in the Army, nor will I tolerate it now where I amconcerned.As for the questions you submitted to Mr. Hanson: I have not the slightestqualmsabout any of them. However, as I stated at the beginning of this letter, I willnot serve tolend any atmosphere of legitimacy to any attempt to invent nonexistent crimes orto- 132 -fabricate evidence by persons with a vested interest in profiting from thePresidioscandal. My attorneys know my feelings, and are presently reviewing thequestions todecide which if any of them are reasonable for the CID to ask of me in thissituation.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceAs Major Harvey had invited me to suggest leads for the CID to pursue toevidenceLilith’s and my innocence and Larry A-T’s guilt, I sent him a letter detailingtwelve suchleads on 1/5/89 (Appendix #44). As I had seen no sign that the CID was the leastinterested in implicating A-T, and indeed was actively preventing suchimplication, Ihad little expectation that any of these leads would be investigated. I wascorrect; theletter was ignored. But I had wanted it down for the record that Harvey hadreceived aresponse to his invitation.On 1/27/89 I sent Harvey my answers to his questions (Appendix #45). Indeed Ididn’t just answer them in a letter; I swore to my answers in an officialstatement. Ifthese answers are beginning to strike you, the reader, as rather repetitious bynow, Ihad precisely the same reaction when [re]typing them. The factual situation, ascompiled in Appendix #34, was about as straightforward and self-evident asanythingcould be. But perhaps the SFFOCID simply wanted some of the points freshlystated fortheir own bureaucratic records.Since I was now officially under CID investigation, I requested and was assignedanArmy attorney from the Trial Defense Service of TJAG. The effectiveness of suchrepresentation within the military justice system has always been debatable. Byinvestigating and/or charging a soldier, the chain of command has alreadyestablishedits interest and predisposition in the matter. Even more so than in civilianjurisprudence, military prosecutors and the commanders who assign them theirmissions are interested only in “mission accomplishment”, which translates to asuccessful prosecution and conviction. Finding the soldier innocent is simplynot partof that scenario. 143While the TDS is given pro forma recognition and cooperation, it is treated moreasan intrusion and an annoyance than an equal investigative or legal authority.JAGofficers assigned to TDS receive mixed signals accordingly: They are expected togothrough the motions of defending their clients, but not to the extent ofembarrassing,impeding, or much less defeating the CID/TJAG prosecution machinery - certainlynotif they expect successful long-term careers in TJAG, that is.143 In 1986, while assigned to Presidio Headquarters, I had been appointedpresident of a court-martial concerning a local recruiting sergeant. My questioning in court broughtout that it was hiscommander, not him, who had violated Army regulations in recruiting procedures.In deliberations Iargued strongly that the sergeant should be found completely innocent, and so hewas - to the obviousfrustration of the CID and the prosecuting JAG - but to the tearful, stunneddelight of the sergeantand his family. On that day military justice deserved its name.- 133 -I was assigned Captain Thomas M. Hayes III, a Senior Defense Counsel. Heimmediately started sending extensive, detailed letters to Harvey, calling hisattentionto all of the so-far-ignored exculpatory evidence and urging that A-T’s motivesandactions be seriously investigated as well - by an independent investigator:I have seen no evidence that the chaplain’s background and possible motives forfalsely accusing LTC Aquino have been examined. This lack of thoroughness isdisturbing and should cause concern to those commanders who have been asked toackon the charges against the chaplain.I suggest several actions to remedy this problem. First, and independentinvestigatorshould be appointed to examine the charges against the chaplain. This will allowfor agreater level of neutrality and lack of predisposition in gathering informationandforming an opinion on the veracity of LTC Aquino’s complaint. It is easy tounderstandthe difficulty that those who are investigating the serious charges surroundingthe ChildDevelopment Center would have with remaining objective in examining the motivesofthe chaplain. Second, LTC Aquino should be invited to the Presidio in order toexplainhis reasoning for swearing out the charges in a face-to-face setting. 144When Harvey ignored his first memorandum, Hayes sent a follow-up on 2/2/89. Inthis one, in addition to restating his earlier points, Hayes added:I have learned that the CID is pursuing private telephone records through theDepartment of Defense Inspector General subpœna process. I request on behalf ofmyclient that you withdraw your request for these records through this process.Use of theprovisions of the Inspector General Act of 1978 for this purpose isinappropriate.When I had refused the CID blanket access to my financial and telephone records,topreclude “fishing expedition” efforts to manufacture evidence145 , and when the6RCIDwas unable to obtain subpœna authority through TJAG channels, it took theillegal stepof invoking the Defense Department Inspector General’s federal subpœna authoritytoobtain them. This authority is legally to be used only for authentic InspectorGeneralinvestigations, not CID/TJAG ones.Harvey ignored Hayes’ second memorandum as well and continued his illegal use ofIG subpœnas. [While through these he received our telephone records, there wasofcourse nothing the least incriminating in them.]Hayes did not appreciate Harvey’s disdain for his TDS office and communiqués. On2/17/89, therefore, he went over Harvey’s head to Major General EugeneCromartie,Commanding General of the Criminal Investigation Command (CIC) at the Departmentof the Army (Appendix #46). I followed this with a letter of my own to Cromartieon3/6/89 (Appendix #47). On 3/21/89 Hayes sent a memorandum to the new 6RCID144 Memorandum, Captain Thomas Hayes to Major Mark Harvey 1/13/89.145 See my 1/1/89 letter to Major Harvey above, and Appendix #45, Q&A 4.- 134 -investigator, Special Agent (Warrant Officer) Dan Cates, again restating hisconcerns,emphasizing the significance of the Hickey notes in impeaching A-T andrequestingthat A-T be flagged accordingly (Appendix #48).Finally on 4/7/89, in response to Hayes’ memoranda and my own letter toCromartie, Harvey finally sent Hayes an answer (Appendix #49). In it Harvey madenomention of the illegal IG subpœnæ, nor of an independent investigation of A-T,nor ofHayes’ request that A-T be flagged. I myself responded to Harvey’s memorandum on4/24/89 (Appendix #49), correcting numerous false statements by Harvey thereinandquestioning the CID’s announced policy that no other flags would be consideredduringthis investigation. In effect this meant that A-T was automatically “protected”while Iwas automatically in a “target”. Harvey ignored this letter as well.By now it was reasonably clear to both Hayes and myself that we were dealingwith aCID which had a predetermined bias and agenda. Unfortunately neither Hayes nor Ihad any power to force correction of this - for example by reassigning theentireinvestigation to another CID Region or to an agency outside of the CICaltogether (suchas the FBI). Equally obvious was that the CIC Commander, Cromartie, wascompletelyin agreement with Harvey’s actions [and inactions]. The deck was stacked fromthebottom to the top.Subsequent contact and correspondence between us was accordingly carried on lesswith the expectation of honest and fair investigation than merely to go onrecord withas much factual and exposé information as possible, to make any fraudulent CICagenda as difficult as possible to frame.In a 5/18/89 memorandum-for-record, for instance, Harvey brought up recent“copycat” allegations by a child named Angelique Jefferson, whose mother hadcontacted Pamfiloff saying that Angelique had “recognized me on TV”. He alsomade anissue over a black panther statue which he had seen in our St. Louis home [wheninvited there for a two-day face-to-face interview a short time previously].Finally hetook issue with the Church of Satan’s Black Mass, about which he had read in TheDevil’s Own, an earlier edition of my history The Church of Satan (an updatedcopy ofwhich I had given him in St. Louis) (Appendix #51). Once again I replied indetailconcerning all these topics to Harvey in two separate 5/31/89 letters(Appendices #52& #53). Seeing that Harvey, a Catholic, was particularly upset by the conceptandcontents of the Black Mass, I pointed out to him that it was no more offensiveto himthan his own church’s Rite of Exorcism was to us, and enclosed a copy of same sothathe could see for himself (Appendix #54).Upon receiving his faxed copies of my two 5/31/89 letters to Harvey, Hayesdecidedthat he smelled a very pungent rat in the woodpile where Harvey’s imminent finalCIDreport was concerned. But if we could have a chance to review and critique thatreportbefore the CID command structure formally committed itself to it, theframing-agendamight still be frustrated. That same date, therefore, Hayes sent an officialrequest to the6RCID commander asking that he and I be permitted such a review, which Hayessaidcould be within the confines of a CID office if necessary (Appendix #55).Withoutreason, elaboration, or justification, Acting 6RCID Commander Lt. ColonelChristopher- 135 -Cole immediately responded to Hayes: “I regret to inform you that this requestisdenied.” 146Assessing the entire situation and scenario at this point in time, I decided towrite tothe 6RCID commander, Colonel Webster Ray, myself. Now quite aware of the framingagenda, I speculated that only an “all cards on the table” solution betweenmyself andthese anonymous, faceless witch-hunters at Department of the Army level mightbringa mutually-acceptable conclusion to this travesty. While earlier letters of minehadintentionally been shared with the widest possible audience of high-levelconcernedofficials, therefore, this one was copied only to Secretary of the Army Marsh,ArmyChief of Staff General Vuono, Chief of the Army Reserve General Ward, and CICCommander General Cromartie. Addressing the letter to the 6RCID commander was amere formality.In this letter I bluntly summarized the bias and agenda of Harvey’s sham“investigation”. I recognized its actual purpose of trying to force me out ofthe Army. Imentioned my illegal non-selection for AGR retention on full-time active duty,and saidthat I would not expose or contest it if the CID did not formally frame me forthe A-Tallegations. Additionally I would abandon any further efforts to expose A-T orsee himbrought to justice. Summarily Lilith and I were exhausted and disgusted by theentire,sordid campaign against us, and would settle for its just being ended with noofficialdishonor to us (Appendix #56).I might as well have saved my breath [or in this instance my fingertips]. On6/30/89Colonel Ray informed Captain Hayes that he would be “titling” me for the A-Tallegations. Harvey also provided Hayes with a copy of the report’s cover sheetdetailing the “titling”. Absurdly, a week later Ray sent me a letter saying thathe had“reviewed your letter of 20 June”, period, and that “I will make my finaltitling decisionbased on my careful review of the final report.” 147 As he had told Hayes of histitlingaction a week previously, and as he considered the contents of my 6/20/89 letternotworth bothering about, it was once more evident that the 6RCID, including itscommanding officer, was merely a rubber-stamp in a much-higher-level-predetermined outcome.Hayes sent me a copy of the report cover sheet, and on 7/4/89 I replied toHarveyconcerning it. As I had not yet received Ray’s 7/6/89 letter, at this moment Istillconsidered it possible that my 6/20/89 letter was being seriously consideredbehind-the-scenes, hence wrote my letter with that in mind (Appendix #57). Harvey’sreplywas as evasive as Ray’s: “It would be inappropriate for me to comment on thecontentsof your letter.” 148On 7/31/89, having heard nothing further from any CID representative, Itelephoned Colonel Ray, who confirmed that he had signed the titling action. I146 Memorandum, Lt. Colonel Christopher Cole to Captain Thomas Hayes 6/2/89.147 Letter, Colonel Webster Ray to Michael Aquino 7/6/89.148 Letter, Major Mark Harvey to M. Aquino 7/6/89.- 136 -discussed my reactions to this in an 8/3/89 letter to General Cromartie(Appendix#58). On 8/24/89 Harvey replied to this on behalf of Ray (who had departedcommandof the 6RCID on 8/11/89): “Colonel Ray asked me to respond on his behalf that itwould be inappropriate for him to comment on the contents of your letters.” A10/20/89 letter from Cromartie’s Staff Judge Advocate said that Cromartie hadapproved Ray’s titling action and that, if I wished, I could submit an“amendmentrequest” concerning it through channels once I had read it. 149 In short, mycontentionthat the generation of the report per se constituted major and multipleviolations of theUCMJ was completely ignored.I might note at this juncture that I had now gone on formal record as accusingthe6RCID investigators, SJA, and Commander - as well as the Major Generalcommandingthe entire U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command if he endorsed them - ofnumerous major and serious violations of Articles #133 & #134 of the UCMJ. I didthisbefore an information-copy audience of several other Department of the Armyseniorofficials. Had I been the slightest bit incorrect in my statements andassessments, I asa Lt. Colonel would have been in serious [and in this case authentic] violationof theUCMJ myself.But throughout all of my correspondence, sworn, and verbal statements, not oncedid any such senior officer ever accuse me of a factual violation in thisregard.Considering the strength and candor of my letters, I think it is justifiable toconcludethat I was never reproved because all recipients knew full well that I spoketruth.Because this truth happened to be politically unacceptable, the only possibleresponsewas to remain mute in the face of it.It took me until 11/30/89 to get a copy of the 6RCID Report of Investigation(ROI).The CID was clearly in no hurry for me to see it, and when I did pry a [heavilycensored] copy loose, I saw why. To Cromartie on that same date I wrote:After an initial reading of the CID report of investigation concerning me, I amabsolutely astounded that the CID would dare to represent such an absurddocument asthis as the basis for a criminal titling action. It is incumbent upon you, asCommandingGeneral, to rescind the fraudulent titling of Mrs. Aquino and myselfimmediately, toorder this “report of investigation” recalled and destroyed, and to initiatedisciplinaryaction against the CID personnel involved for such an outrageous and illegalabuse oftheir investigatory and titling license.I enclose an analysis150 covering just the cover letter151 of this report. WhileI intendto draft a similar analysis of the rest of the report, you have no excusewhatever fordelaying its invalidation and the removal of the titling actions one momentfurther.149 Letter, Lt. Colonel Brent Green to M. Aquino 10/20/89.150 Appendix #60.151 Appendix #59.- 137 -I am advised by the Director of the Crime Records Center that news media arealready requesting copies of this report. If it is provided to the media, I willof courseprovide all of the documentation containing the truth to those same media. Quiteobviously the result would be a scandal which would utterly disgrace the entireCID andthe United States Army. Accordingly your immediate action to rescind the titlingandinvalidate the report is all the more important.As by now routine, this letter and its enclosure was copied to every majorcommander and official in the U.S. Army concerned in any way with the A-Taffair. Asalso by now routine, Cromartie did not respond to it.On 12/22/89 I sent Cromartie [with copies to all of the same Army officials] afollow-up letter addressing the detailed section of the ROI following its coverletter, the“Narrative/Summary of Significant Information”. This letter and its accompanyinganalysis of that Narrative appear as Appendix #61. Again there was no responsefromCromartie personally. A week later, however, I did receive this letter:Department of the ArmyUnited States Army Criminal Investigation CommandDecember 28, 1989Dear Colonel Aquino:This is in reply to your request of November 30, 1989, for amendment of U.S.ArmyCriminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) Report of Investigation (ROl) numbered88-C1D026-69259.

Hardy, DirectorCrime Records Center- 138 -This was the same Wilbur Hardy who [see Chapter #5] had worked so exhaustivelyto deny me a copy of the “nonexistent” CID report of investigation into mychargesagainst A-T. Apparently Hardy was now tasked to divert my current correspondencefrom its focus upon the CID’s modus operandi into a routine amendment request.Itdidn’t sell. I wrote back [with copies to the “usual everybody” throughout theDepartment of the Army]:January 6, 1990Dear Mr. Hardy:I am in receipt of your letter of December 28, 1989.My 11/30/89 letter to General Cromartie does not request mere “amendment” of the6th Region CID’s report of investigation #88-C1D026-69259. Rather it specifiesthecomplete and total invalidation of that report, and the removal of thefraudulenttitling actions contained within it, as being flagrant violations of theConstitution, theUniform Code of Military Justice, Army Regulations, and CIDC regulations.As General Cromartie is well aware from my 11/30/89 and 12/22/89 letters andenclosures addressing just the cover-letter and narrative portions of thatreport, itscontents substantiate none of the titling actions whatever. It is nothing morethana clumsy, ignorant, and coarse attempt by Major Mark Harvey, with the complicityofex-commander Colonel Ray, to smear myself, Mrs. Aquino, and our religion with anincoherent ramble of lies, falsified “evidence”, statements deliberatelymisquoted/misinterpreted/edited out-of-context, and interviews which have no conceivablerelevance to the investigation but were clearly solicited and included simplyforpurposes of character assassination. Harvey, whose Catholic selfrighteousness isobviously incensed by the theology and philosophy of a legitimate religionembarrassingto his own, presumes to use his office in the CID to mount an amateurInquisition.Obviously Harvey assumes that in so doing he will be protected from personalaccountability by the CID “organization”, which now faces the awkward task oftrying toexplain the 6th Region’s massive violations of UCMJ Articles 133 and 134pertaining tofalse official statements, misprision of serious offense [of ChaplainAdams-Thompson],attempted manufacture of evidence, and obstruction of justice. I have beenindexing allsuch violations in my continuing review of the report, and a detailed list ofthem when Iam finished will be a major paperwork exercise in itself.This report is an utter disgrace to the CIDC, and to the U.S. Army which dependsupon the CIDC to set and maintain exemplary standards of ethics, impartiality,andrespect for the law in its investigations. For you to try to represent thereport as aproperly-prepared document for which normal AR 195-2 “amendment” procedures areappropriate is, under the circumstances, ludicrous.It is incumbent upon General Cromartie to rescind and invalidate the report initsentirety immediately. As for Harvey and anyone else found to be responsible forcreating it, it is an outrage that such incompetent and unprincipled individualsshouldbe entrusted with positions which they can abuse to violate the law soarrogantly, and toattack honorable soldiers and their families so viciously and wantonly.Honest errors due to “best guesses” in investigations where all the facts arenotavailable, or where the individual under investigation is uncooperative orobstructive,- 139 -are quite understandable. Such an excuse cannot be claimed for this ROI,however. TheCID investigators received full and complete cooperation at all times, as boththe TrialDefense Service and I assumed that the CID was an ethical and professionalinstitution.The documented facts exonerating Mrs. Aquino and myself, and proving beyond adoubt the criminal actions of Adams-Thompson, are both abundant andindisputable.The ROI, with an editorial bias comparable only to the most grotesqueanti-Semiticpropaganda of Nazi Germany, simply ignores the multitude of facts whichestablish thetruth, invents falsehoods, twists whatever facts it cannot disregard, andclumsilyattempts to fabricate “incriminating evidence” where none exists.This is such an obscene caricature of how a CIDC investigation should not beconducted that I am surprised I should have to go through the motions ofexposing thisreport at all. I would have thought that such a vulgar piece of trash would havebeenrejected the moment it arrived on General Cromartie’s desk.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceAs 1989 came to a close, and with my personal communications to the CIDappearing wholly and simply to be ignored, I decided that it was time to retainacivilian attorney specializing in military cases. One name stood out beyond allthe rest:Gary Myers.152 He agreed that at this stage of things, Army officialdom wouldpayattention only to an attorney, and that the Army’s own Trial Defense Serviceofficers,while well-intentioned, simply did not have the license, skill, or adrenaline topursuejustice aggressively.Myers’ first step was to indeed file a formal Appeal of the CID ROI and its“titling”actions. This Appeal appears at Appendix #62. It was submitted on 1/31/90; sixmonths then elapsed in silence. When the 7/30/90 official reply finally arrived,itremoved all titlings from Lilith’s name and removed all titlings from my namewith theexception of:LTC Aquino should remain titled as a subject for the offenses of conspiracy,kidnapping, sodomy, indecent acts or liberties with a child, indecent acts, andfalseswearing. 153None of the factual contents of Gary Myers’ appeal was addressed or evenmentioned. The one-sentence reason for retaining the titlings quoted above was:“Theevidence of alibi offered by LTC Aquino was not persuasive.” 154152 http://www.mcmilitarylaw.com/153 Letter, Colonel Francis A. Gilligan, Chief, Criminal Law Division, Office ofthe Judge AdvocateGeneral, Department of the Army to Deputy Commander, USA Criminal InvestigationCommand,SUBJECT: Review of Amendment Request by LTC Michael A. Aquino, 30 July 1990.154 Ibid.- 140 -In an immediate response to the Judge Advocate General I wrote:This document reaffirms the titling of Lt. Colonel Aquino for “conspiracy,kidnapping, sodomy, indecent acts or liberties with a child, indecent acts, andfalseswearing”. The decision to retain these titlings was made by Colonel Francis A.Gilligan,Chief, Criminal Law Division, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Departmentof theArmy. Colonel Gilligan was in possession of abundant evidence proving allof these allegations to be false. This document is therefore a false officialstatementby Colonel Gilligan in violation of Article 133, UCMJ.Gilligan falsely implies that I have practiced “nudity and indecent acts withintheconfines of a private religious ceremony”. I have done neither, and there is noevidence to indicate that I have. This statement by Gilligan is thereforeevidence of afalse official statement by him in violation of Article 133, UCMJ.Gilligan falsely states that “the evidence of alibi offered by Lt. ColonelAquino is notpersuasive”. Gilligan knows that the CID fraudulently altered the date ofaccusationfrom September-October 1986 to June 10, 1986 when it was established that I wasnotin San Francisco on a “workable” date in September-October 1986. The statementprovided by Graham Marshall that there were no children anywhere in ourresidence at123 Acme Avenue on June 10, 1986 was conclusive. The CID would later try toevadethis by shifting the alleged location to a downstairs apartment - which wasimmediatelydisproven by Commander William Butch, USNR, resident of that apartment. Thisstatement by Gilligan is therefore evidence of a false official statement by himinviolation of Article 133, UCMJ. It is further evidence of an act by him toobstruct justicein violation of Article 134, UCMJ. 155Subsequently I discovered more about how Gilligan’s decision had been made, andcommented in a letter to my own Commanding General at ARPERCEN:October 18, 1990Brigadier General Thomas J. KilmartinCommanding GeneralU.S. Army Reserve Personnel CenterDear General Kilmartin:Enclosed is a copy of a letter just received from the CID responding to myrequest tohave the fraudulent investigative report and titling of Mrs. Aquino and myselfexpunged.According to my attorney, what actually took place at DA was that the CID’s ownlegal counsel recommended expungement. However the significance of the CID’sadmitting to such a blatant act of corruption, falsification, and characterassassinationas the report constitutes was such that the decision was bucked to TJAG, whereitlanguished for months while some face-saving solution for the Army was sought.There155 Memorandum, M. Aquino to the Judge Advocate General of the Army 7/30/90.- 141 -was, of course, no such solution. The evidence of our innocence was overwhelmingandconclusive, as it always had been from the beginning.Therefore this letter from the CID, as dictated by TJAG, represents a clumsyeffort attrying to protect and conceal some remnant of the criminal actions committedagainstus - giving us part of the relief we requested on the hope that we would thenjust goaway and endure the rest.The “maltreatment of a subordinate/Article #30” titling was placed in theoriginalreport to find some way of dealing with the court-martial charges that I twicepreferredagainst Adams-Thompson for his crimes against us (false official statements) andtheU.S. government (false claims). Both times the Army suppressed the charges Ipreferredagainst him with no proper inquiry into or. refutation of the evidence aspresented. Ifthe “maltreatment of a subordinate” titling is now removed, then the CID inessenceadmits that those charges I preferred were justified. In that case I am ofcourseinnocent and he is guilty of criminal actions as charged.The “conduct unbecoming an officer” titling was placed in the original reportpurelyand simply as an effort to attack my religion, which is and always has been alegitimatereligion involving no criminal or undignified conduct on my part whatever. TheCIDknew this from the beginning, yet deliberately set out to misrepresent it - andin doingso blatantly violated the First Amendment and AR 600-20 - in an attempt toassassinatemy character [and draw attention away from the fact that the report could not intheleast substantiate the Adams-Thompson accusation against Mrs. Aquino andmyself]. The removal of this titling admits the criminal actions by the CIDwhich thatcharacter-assassination effort constitutes, which of course means that theofficers whowrote it and approved it should now be charged for their crimes (false officialstatements and acts of religious discrimination). That would involve (atminimum)charges against the Major who wrote the report, the Colonel who approved it attheSixth Region CID, and Major General Cromartie for approving it at the CIDheadquarters.The removal of all titlings from the name of Mrs. Aquino, while retaining themagainst my name, is perhaps the most conspicuous evidence of the officialcorruptionwhich has marked this affair from the start. [Even the phrase “insufficientevidence” isindicative. There is not “insufficient evidence”; there is no evidencewhatever.]Adams-Thompson’s fake “child-abuse” allegations were directed against both ofus,who were alleged to have “committed every crime” together. If the CID now admitsthatthere is no reason whatever to title Mrs. Aquino, then there is equally noreason to titleme - save, once again, to try to cover up the fact that the entire report, andthe entireattempt to falsify any kind of case against me, is a deliberate lie from startto finish.I am utterly disgusted at such corruption and dishonesty. As I indicated to youpreviously, I have therefore instructed my attorney to commence immediately anactionagainst the Army in United States District Court to have the remaining titlingsexpunged.I continue to respect those many ethical and honorable soldiers with whom it hasbeen my privilege to serve throughout my Army career, and whose contribution toournation’s security has brought honor and dignity to the Army. Accordingly it isall themore inconceivable to me that this same Army should tolerate such dishonesty and- 142 -corruption as the CID, and any higher officials dictating its conduct in thisaffair, haveshown.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceAdministrative channels within the Army to invalidate the Report ofInvestigationnow having been exhausted, the only remaining recourse was to sue the Armyconcerning it in federal court. That is the subject of the next chapter.- 143 -Chapter 8: The LawsuitThe situation as of November 1, 1990: The CID investigation of Lilith and myselfhadbeen concluded. Administratively its “titlings” of Lilith for everything, andmyself foreverything but the A-T allegation, had been removed. No court-martial charges oranyother punitive action (such as non-judicial punishment or even a letter ofreprimand)had been taken against me. My Top Secret/Special Compartmented Intelligencesecurity clearance had been immediately restored. My full-time (Active Guard &Reserve = AGR) tour of duty had come to an end on 8/31/90, hence I had beenreturned to the part-time Army Reserve. Herein I had been assigned to anIndividualMobilization Augmentee (IMA) position as a Space Intelligence Officer atHeadquarters, U.S. Space Command. As with other part-time Reservists, thisrequiredtwo weeks’ active duty with that headquarters each year. All of my OfficerEfficiencyReports to date continued to give me the highest possible ratings in allcategories.Thus I could have just “walked away” from the CID investigation and report.I was, however, incensed that such injustices had been perpetrated, andofficiallysanctioned at the highest levels of the Army, against Lilith and myself. MyattorneyGary Myers advised that my only option was to sue the Army in federal court.Myers further advised that a full-blown lawsuit embracing, essentially, all ofthepersonalities and actions in the foregoing chapters of this ebook, would beexpensive,costing several hundreds of thousands of dollars. Numerous witnesses, subpœnæ,statements, motions, court-time, appeals, transportation, housing, legalassistancestaff, etc. As I had already spent well over one hundred thousand dollars todatedefending ourselves, I certainly did not have the resources for such anexpensive andindefinite lawsuit.There was one option, Myers said: a Motion for Summary Judgment. Essentiallythisis a federal court hearing in which each side presents a written brief and anoralargument before a judge. There are no witnesses or testimony, and of course nojury.The judge simply considers the written and oral arguments and makes his owndecisionabout them. This would merely cost tens of thousands of dollars. I decided topursuethis option.What could I expect to accomplish? Initially, since federal court Discoverywouldapply, I would obtain a complete, uncensored copy of the CID Report ofInvestigation(ROI). [The copy the CID had finally provided to me as described in the previouschapter had been extensively blacked-out, such that it had been possible for metorefute it only by inferring or guessing much of its contents.]How much more than this might happen was dependent upon the judge’s decision,what orders if any he might issue, and of course the Army’s willingness tocomply withthem, much less to initiate corrective action of its own based upon thedecision. I hopedthat at least the ROI would be officially discredited and ordered discarded initsentirety [to include of course the remaining titling]. While a titling itself isnot recorded- 144 -outside the CID’s own records - it was not, for instance, included in myofficial U.S.Army Personnel Records file (OMPF) - its existence anywhere outraged me.As for the Army’s investigating, prosecuting, and punishing all those who hadviolated the Uniform Code of Military Justice throughout this entire affair, Iknew therewas very little chance of that happening. I had by now identified, documented,andreported numerous such violations (comparable to civilian felonies) by a greatmanyofficers up to the highest general officer ranks. Conspicuous among these weretheCommanding General of the entire Army Criminal Investigation Command and theJudge Advocate General of the Army. Not to mention a trail leading all the wayto theSecretary of the Army himself. Would the United States send all of these peopleto jailjust to deliver justice to one lieutenant colonel and his wife? Not very likely.Well, as Don Quixote might have said to the windmills, “En garde!”On 11/15/90 Myers filed the Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Damageswith the U.S. District Court in Virginia [proximate to Washington, D.C.]. ThisComplaint appears at Appendix #63.Along with it were submitted a number of “Interrogatories”, being questions fortheCID whose answers were now court-mandated. These Interrogatories, the CID’sresponses to them, and my critique of those answers to Myers, appear at Appendix#64. Nothing new was learned from the CID’s answers; they were clearly justMajorHarvey’s continued evasion and lying. As with the ROI itself, it was if nothingelseobvious that he had been officially assured that he could [continue to] do sowithimpunity.The evident ease and casualness with which Harvey and other CID/TJAG officerslied, moreover, was a phenomenon that was very slow and difficult for me tocomprehend and accept. U.S. commissioned officers are expected to adhere to anextremely rigorous, indeed inflexible code of official integrity. Lying inofficialstatements or documents is formally a court-martial offense, but - in the entiremilitaryculture - it just isn’t done. “An officer’s word is his bond”, and the armedforces havelong been accustomed to taking that strictly and seriously.Prior to the A-T affair I had throughout my career never interacted very muchwitheither the Judge Advocate General’s Corps or the Criminal Investigation Command.For most soldiers “JAGs” were just there to provide soldiers with free/routinelegaladvice and services, and the CID was an odd conglomerate of warrant officers andcivilians called in to investigate the occasional government property theft orpersonnelmisconduct. Since JAG attorneys were also commissioned as officers, I assumedthatthey would be indoctrinated into, and just as conscientiously adhere to thestandards ofintegrity and truthfulness expected of all other officers.As I think has been amply evidenced here, this did not turn out to be the caseat all.The CID and its TJAG superiors all lied routinely, easily, and repeatedly; andsuchbehavior was sanctioned all the way to the top of their chains of command.It seemed then, and still seems today to me almost incredible that the Armycouldfunction with such indifferent corruption in its legal and investigativebranches, butthere it was nonetheless. Following the A-T affair I would never again trust anyJAG- 145 -office/officer [of which/whom I consider the CID merely a “facilitating”device]. Iwould caution anyone considering a military career to take my experience hereintoaccount as well.Taking over from Major Harvey at this stage of things was JAG Major PatrickLisowski from the Department of the Army’s TJAG Litigation Division.After receiving the TJAG/CID’s response to his Interrogatories, Gary Myers wentonto draft and file his brief with the District Court (Appendix #65). In lieu ofreprintingLisowski’s brief completely, I have in Appendix #66 quoted its substantive partsandidentified the numerous falsehoods contained therein.Shortly thereafter Myers filed a reply brief (Appendix #67). In this reply briefhecontests Lisowski’s strenuous efforts in his brief to blanket-exempt allTJAG/CID ROIsfrom judicial review under the U.S. Privacy Act. The significance of such anexemption,if successful, would be that de novo judicial consideration of the ROI’sevidence wouldnot occur, that the “preponderance of the evidence” standard for any conclusionsfromthat evidence would also not be applied, and that the ROI author would be exemptfrom punitive damages and attorney costs.The much weaker Administrative Procedure Act, which the CID argued should applyinstead of the Privacy Act, would also require much stronger and explicitevidence ofgovernmental misconduct than the Privacy Act.In short, the strategy of Lisowski was to argue that the judge had no authoritytolook into the ROI itself, nor to evaluate the validity of its contents: it wasthe inviolateprerogative of TJAG/CID to write whatever it wished into its reports.Following the filing of briefs, oral arguments were scheduled for 5/31/91. Atranscript of these arguments appears as Appendix #68.District Court Judge Claude M. Hilton issued his ruling on 7/1/91 (Appendix#69).Ignoring all of Myers’ factual points concerning the case, while uncriticallyrecitingLisowski’s lies as “truth”, Hilton obligingly swept aside the Privacy Act andfound thatunder the Administrative Procedure Act TJAG/CID was free to have whateveropinionsit wished. Not a single one of Myers’ legal points was even mentioned, much lessrefuted.So glaring was the bias in this district court ruling that Gary Myers stronglyurged anappeal to the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite the considerablecourtand legal expense involved, I agreed. If it had been unthinkable that thedistrict courtwould condone the numerous crimes committed by TJAG/CID and embodied in thisROI, it was impossible that three senior judges of an appeals court would alsosanctionsuch a miscarriage of justice.Myers’ appeal brief (Appendix #70) devoted most of its body to an extensive,exhaustive, detailed, and forceful argument as to why the Privacy Act shouldindeed beallowed as the judicial standard for this case. His object was quite simple: Ifthe PrivacyAct prevailed, then the district court judge, under its de novo requirements,would beforced to personally examine all of the “evidence” in the ROI in terms of itsaccuracy,factuality, and objectivity. In the remainder of his brief Myers once againlisted anumber of the ROI’s lies and omissions.- 146 -Historically the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals had set strong and repeatedlegalprecedent for the applicability of the Privacy Act in cases such as this.AccordinglyMyers felt quite certain that it would uphold its previous rulings and requirethat Acthere.Once again Lisowski’s main goal was at all costs to prevent the Privacy Act frombeing applied. Where he referred to the case itself, he once again freely andrepeatedlylied to the appeals court, as again documented in Appendix #71.The unanimous decision of the three-judge panel of the appeals court, when itwasissued on 2/26/92 was, if anything, even more startling and incredible than thatof thedistrict court. Once again all of Myers’ arguments were simply ignored as if hehadnever written or spoken them, whereas Lisowski’s were all accepted and parrotedwithout any question whatever. The court’s ruling, annotated to detail theextent ofthis, appears as Appendix #72.Most unexpected in this ruling was the court’s 180° turn rejecting all of itsprevious rulings and precedents concerning the Privacy Act. The implications ofthiswent far beyond my particular case, virtually freeing all federal investigativeagenciesfrom judicial accountability for the conduct of their investigations and contentof theirreports.All a stunned Gary Myers could think of to do was to file an immediate requestforhis appeal to be reheard en banc by the entire court (beyond the three-judgepanel).This request appears as Appendix #73. Upon receiving my copy I wrote to Gary:March 14, 1992Dear Gary:Received today the brief for rehearing en banc. As with your earlier briefs, itlooks[to my rational, if not legalistic eyes] faultless. But I have been astoundedand dismayedby first the district and then the 3-judge appeals decisions, so don’t know whatto expectany more. It seems to me that, from the day when Adams-Thompson made his firstaccusation, this entire affair has been driven by an Alice in Wonderland “logic”in whichall constants are variables at the pleasure of the Army: If a law, rule, or factgets in theway, just ignore it or arbitrarily change it.After all of the “changes” I have seen the Army calmly manufacture to try to getthetitling to “fit”, the latest is Lisowski’s invocation of - and the appealjudges’ blessing of -various items in our apartment which (a) no child mentioned, (b) were not on thesearch warrant, (c) were never confiscated as “evidence” during the search, and(d) areirrelevant since [in the interrogatory answers] the Army dodged GrahamMarshall’salibi by proceeding to move the “location” out of our flat entirely [thereafterdodgingCdr. Butch’s alibi of his flat by simply ignoring it altogether]. The courtthereforesanctions the CID’s right to keep changing not only dates and locations but thepresence/absence of physical evidence at whim. This sets a charming precedentfor thefuture of criminal investigation, don’t you think?I am beginning to get the feeling that the moment someone hears the “S-word” -Satanism - logic and sanity fly out the window to be replaced with some sort ofweird“Inquisition mind-set” which dictates: “Fry this guy, no matter whether he isright or- 147 -wrong. It is inconceivable that a Satanist could be innocent of anything-particularlyan especially heinous accusation!”In another context, as I read the en banc brief, I see the seriousness of thegenerallegal point you are making. If the 3-judge decision stands, the ripples go farbeyond mycase to a blanket carte blanche for the CID, FBI, etc. to say and do whateverthey wishwith virtual immunity. That is a frightening prospect, particularly given theirresponsibility and falsification the Army has displayed in just thissituation.Lilith and I continue to be very grateful to you and John Wickham for yourvaliantefforts not simply in support of our cause, but in support of the more generalprinciplesof truth and justice in the courts which are at issue here./s/ MichaelThe following month, without explanation or comment, the court denied Myers’request for an en banc rehearing. Even Lisowski - who, Myers said, hadoriginallyremarked to him that he didn’t expect the Army to win this case - called Myerstoexpress professional sympathy.Only one option remained: a further appeal to the United States Supreme Court.Merely the filing fees for this would have been over forty thousand dollars, andtherewas no guarantee that the court would accept the case even then. Still, GaryMyers andhis associate John Wickham (son of a former 4-star general and Army Chief ofStaff)informed me that they would donate their own fees and expenses if I wished to goahead. I wrote back to Gary:April 25, 1992Dear Gary:I was going to wait until I had received your package of papers before sendingthisletter, in case there was something therein which called for a comment from me.Thepackage has not yet arrived, however, so I’ll post this letter now.First Lilith and I would like to thank both you and John Wickham again for yourlegal efforts on our behalf. We think that you both did a valiant job, and ofcoursedeserved to prevail in the district and appeals courts. That you did not speakssimply tothe failure of the court system to administer justice as it is supposed to do.That brings me to your gracious offer to carry the fight to the Supreme Courtforcosts only, with you and Mr. Wickham donating your time.Given the nature of the current Supreme Court, we think this would simply be awaste of our funds and your & Mr. Wickham’s valuable time [and dignity].The cold fact is that we received not so much as a crumb of consideration fromthedistrict court, and equal indifference from the appeals court.There was not a single word in support of our position, not a single dissentfrom anyjudge, not even the slightest indication that any of the judges had evenbothered toread any of the meticulous and conclusive briefs you filed. You might as wellhave beenwriting and talking to a brick wall.Lisowski’s crocodile-tears of “surprise and sympathy” to you are the height ofhypocrisy under the circumstances.- 148 -Until and unless the courts are going to pay attention to the law and the truth,youand Mr. Wickham should not tolerate being made to look like fools in thisdemeaningand insulting fashion.We have already identified the reasons for this situation:(1) No court is going to declare a “Satanist” innocent of anything, even if heis.(2) “Child-molestation” remains automatic justification for witch-hunts, evenwhen the fakery used to instigate such scams has been exposed.(3) The Army Corps of Chaplains cannot be criticized.(4) The Army Medical Corps cannot be criticized.(5) The Army CID cannot be criticized.(6) The Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps cannot be criticized.(7) “Army parents” - i.e. those who participated in the Presidio scam - cannotbecriticized.(8) A flock of generals and colonels who violated the law to participate in ourframing and the Adams-Thompson cover-up cannot be criticized.(9) Ex-Secretary of the Army Marsh cannot be criticized.(10) Senator Jesse Helms cannot be criticized.Ergo the Army has informed the courts that this case is not to be won byplaintiff,period.These truths being self-evident [to borrow a phrase from Jefferson], what can bedone at this point?First I intend to pursue Harvey’s personal violation of the ROI confidentialityandLisowski’s [and his bosses’] lies in court through the Army and possibly DefenseDepartment chain of command. Obviously I don’t expect anything to come of this.But Iwant to go through the motions, if only to satisfy my curiosity as to whatwiggling andsquirming by more generals and colonels will occur. To date, as you’ve seen,TJAG andthe IG are having fun throwing the hot potato back and forth between the two ofthem,presumably in an effort to prevent it from landing once again on the Chief ofStaff’s orSecretary of the Army’s desk.Once this Keystone Kops farce has been played out, then it’s time to get seriousagain. At your convenience I would like to hear your thoughts on a lawsuitagainst theArmy for Harvey’s Privacy Act violation, pure and simple. The idea is not towastefurther time on the titling action itself, as that is obviously a politicalsacred cow. Butnarrowly and specifically on Harvey’s violation of the ROI confidentiality.That, it seemsto me, should be impossible for the Army to defend or excuse. And here we aretalkingnot about a gaggle of politicians and generals, but about just one major. Idoubt that theArmy would armtwist the courts quite so earnestly in his case.If we win a judgment against Harvey, we will then be in a financial position toinvestfurther big funds in the “main case”. It seems to me that the way to go relatesto theArmy’s numerous and documented lies to the courts, as I have extensively listed.Itcannot be acceptable for attorneys to deliberately lie to courts. Whether thesolutionlies through petitions to the same courts, or protests with bar associations, orwhatever,I will be interested in pursuing it.- 149 -When and if we prevail, then the way is presumably clear to retrying the maincasewith the Army prevented from lying. Even if the courts still resist applying thePrivacyAct, we should prevail under the Administrative Procedure Act. At that pointthere willsimply be nothing for the Army to say to prevent it.Carthago delenda est./s/ MichaelI had commenced correspondence within the Army to formally protest MajorLisowski’s lies to the district and appeals courts in December 1991 - to boththe JudgeAdvocate General and the Inspector General of the Army. I was nonethelessreasonablycertain that, as with Harvey, Lisowski knew beforehand that his courtroom liesin thiscase were both sanctioned and protected.Summarily the Inspector General disclaimed any authority to investigatemisconduct by the Judge Advocate General, and the Judge Advocate Generalresponded that he saw nothing illegal or unethical in the actions of any JAGofficerinvolved in the case.Finally, feeling as though I might as well make the attempt, I sent two letters(Appendices #74 & #75) to the seniormost officer of the Army, Chief of StaffGeneralGordon Sullivan. If he wished, he had the power to overrule the Judge AdvocateGeneral. Evidently he did not so wish; both my letters went unanswered.And that was the end.I had exhausted all avenues, all resources; I could do nothing more.- 150 -EpilogueMeanwhile ...Among the strangest aspects of this entire, bizarre affair was that, apart fromtheCID and TJAG, the United States Army and I were getting along just fine - as wealwayshad previously - from the time of A-T’s allegations to 1994, when I requestedtransfer tothe Retired Reserve. My Officer Efficiency Reports for this period containednothingbut the highest praise - including of my integrity and moral character. And, forthatmatter, thereafter to the present, as in 2006 I was again transferred to theArmy of theUnited States, wherein I remain a lifelong Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) withfull payand benefits.From the time of A-T’s original attack against Lilith and myself, not a singleofficerin my chain of command ever indicated the slightest doubt as to our innocenceandintegrity. Off-duty we were always invited to all command social functions, andalwaysgreeted warmly by other officer families as well.Throughout the CID/TJAG ordeal, I routinely kept my own commander, BrigadierGeneral Paul Babiak of the Army Reserve Personnel Center, personally updated onallcommunications and developments. He knew he was always welcome to ask me anyquestions he wished, all of which were courteous and supportive.When my Active Guard & Reserve assignment at ARPERCEN ended on 8/31/90, Iwas presented with a Certificate of Appreciation by General Babiak’s successor,Brigadier General Thomas J. Kilmartin, and Lilith and I were given a rousingfarewellparty.Subsequently I was assigned in the part-time Army Reserve as an IndividualMobilization Augmentee (IMA) to Headquarters, United States Space Command,Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. As a Military Intelligence officer I wasfirst sent tothe Joint Space Intelligence Operations Course administered by the Air Force fortheArmy Space Institute, then assigned to the office of the Deputy Chief of StaffforIntelligence, SPACECOM and NORAD. I served in this office until 1994, when Idecidedto request transfer to the Retired Reserve.At that time, by order of the [new!] Secretary of the Army, I was awarded theMeritorious Service Medal covering the entire previous ten years. This of courseincluded the duration of the A-T attack, the investigations, and the lawsuit. Isaw in thismedal a symbolic and subliminal, if not explicit apology for what had been doneto meunder the previous Secretary.In addition to the trust and confidence shown in me by my own commanders andfellow officers, the U.S. Army Intelligence & Security Command - which hasauthorityand absolute discretion over all personnel security clearances - had made itclear fromthe beginning that it would take no part in the disgraceful agenda of TJAG/CID.Security clearances are not in the least bound by any formal legal procedures or- 151 -constraints: If AISC feels that you are a risk for any reason whatever, yourclearanceevaporates instantly and there is no appeal, including through the courts.[Without atleast a Secret clearance, a commissioned officer cannot function at all, hencewouldhave to leave the Service.]In short, had AISC felt there was any substance to the A-T attack, my clearancewould have been revoked the moment he made it, and even if I were never chargedwith any crime or court-martialed, it could still have denied that clearancepermanently.In my case this was especially significant because from 1976 to 1986 myclearancehad been at the highest general classification - Top Secret (TS) - andthereafter at theeven more rarified Top Secret/Special Compartmented Intelligence (TS/SCI). Itscarcely needs saying that personnel even suspected of having committed anycrimeswhatever, much less serious ones, do not get such clearances.When the CID opened its investigation on 11/23/88, my security clearance wasautomatically and routinely suspended. The moment the investigation wasconcludedwith no charges, AISC instantly restored me to TS/SCI as before. The bogus“titling”was obviously treated with the contempt and disregard it deserved.In 1991 my clearance came up for its regularly-scheduled re-evaluation by theDefense Investigative Service (DIS), which handles all such investigationsthroughoutthe Department of Defense. TS/SCI requires the most extensive and exhaustivesuchexamination, called a Special Background Investigation (SBI). Towards the end oftheprocess there is at least one personal interview, and when mine took place, Itold thetwo DIS Agents that they were welcome to ask me anything about the entire A-Taffair.It was not in the least necessary, they responded. My TS/SCI clearance wasrenewed,and remained effective until my retirement request was approved in 1994.Through a Glass, 2014For many years it was extremely difficult for me to look back on the A-T episodewithout intense anger and frustration. Like many other victims of “satanicritual abuse”scams during the 1980s’ hysteria and witch-hunts, Lilith and I could have beenimprisoned and possibly seriously injured or killed in prison for a “crime” thathadnever happened, just so that a chaplain and his wife could waltz comfortablyinto theirfuture with a $3 million fattening of their bank account. It wouldn’t have beenanybetter had they known us or had any actual reason to hate us; but it was quiteclear thatthey were utterly indifferent to us except as a convenient means to theirmonetaryclaims scheme.The FBI and the SFPD quickly realized the scam for what it was, and washed theirhands of it as soon as gracefully possible. Obviously holding any of thePresidio’s“media martyred parents” to account instead was, in the climate of the nationalmania,not possible either.- 152 -There the matter might have ended had it not been for Geraldo Rivera’s continuedtabloid-television sensationalizing and agitation about “satanic crime”, whichdraggedme back into the controversial national [indeed international] spotlight.At that point, as a result of pressure from Jesse Helms and other Senators andCongressmen, Secretary of the Army Marsh and/or his senior military generalsdecidedthat Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino had simply become more of an inconvenience thananasset to the Army, and would have to be removed at least from the visibility offull-timeactive duty. That I might not personally deserve this was regrettable butpoliticallyirrelevant.The CID was accordingly instructed to open an investigation on 11/23/88 based onthe A-T allegations. Since these were already known to be false, no actualcourt-martialwas ever contemplated; the idea was simply to intimidate me into resigning mycommission [as CID Agent Cates bluntly and explicitly suggested over lunch atour firstmeeting]. Failing that, I would at least be discontinued from the full-time AGRandreturned to the less-visible part-time Reserve.What had not been anticipated was the intensity, tenacity, and precision of myresistance to this agenda. A great many generals and colonels were placed in theunexpected and decidedly uncomfortable position of being party to156 , or inknowingtolerance of157 crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for theirroles in theaffair. They were all saved from accountability for the same reason: that theagendaremained blessed from the very top. Neither actions nor inactions in furtheranceof itwould be officially acknowledged or penalized.The infamous ROI was the most transparent kind of travesty. Had any of thecommand recipients believed even one of its “titlings”, I would of course havebeencourt-martialed instantly. There was plenty of time to finalize the ROI beforethestatute of limitations ran on the A-T accusation, and of course no statute hadrun onany of the other CID tag-ons like “false swearing”. The CID Region Commander wastold in advance that he would “approve” it [as Captain Hayes was informed], andthegeneral court-martial authority was also told in advance that he would “decide”thatthere be no court-martial consequently [as Gary Myers was informed].My own chain of command and the Army Intelligence & Security Command refusedany participation in this entire farce.The civil lawsuit process brought an uncertain new dimension to the affair.Clearlythe Army had not anticipated such exposure and accountability, and its onlyrecoursewas to get the courts to disallow the de novo spotlight and “preponderance oftheevidence” standards of the U.S. Privacy Act. Fortunately for TJAG/CID, both thedistrict and appeals courts sheltered them by rejecting that Act. Evidently thecourtsrealized that the shock- and ripple-effects of exposing the truth in this casecould go156 False official statement (violation of Article 133, UCMJ). Manufacture ofevidence, obstruction ofjustice (violation of Article 134, UCMJ).157 Misprision of serious offense (violation of Article 134, UCMJ).- 153 -much farther throughout the Army command structure and Congress than would bepolitically desirable.In retrospect I also think that my own professional conduct throughout theentireepisode won me some grudging respect from the nameless and facelessorchestrators ofthe agenda. I could still not be allowed to win absolutely and completely, butit was alsoclear that I was just as good an officer now as I had been throughout all of mymilitarycareer. Once symbolically removed from the AGR, I would thus be allowed tocontinuemy Reserve career in positions of the highest trust and prestige [as indeedhappened].Am I still incensed that Lilith and I weren’t fully and openly vindicated, thatA-Twasn’t court-martialed and imprisoned for what he did to us, and that MajorsHarveyand Lisowski didn’t join him in Fort Leavenworth for what they did? Certainly.All ofthem went on to comfortable promotions - A-T retiring from the Corps ofChaplains asa full Colonel. [Absent a complete exoneration, and possibly not even thenbecause ofthe shadow of A-T’s scam, my own prospects for further promotion were destroyed,allof the “promote ahead of contemporaries” recommendations in my OfficerEfficiencyReports and my Senior Service College “anointing” notwithstanding. Nor would ithavehelped that all Colonel promotions require Senate confirmation, which JesseHelmswould have sabotaged. Had it not been for the A-T scam, of course, GeraldoRiveracould not have used it to force my appearance on his “special”, hence I wouldnot havecome to Helms’ attention.]The CID’s illegal manipulation of the AGR continuation board terminated my full-time career one tour before I could qualify for Active Army retirement benefits:ahigher retirement pension and immediate medical coverage instead of my presentReserve benefits.Three years of criminal investigation, despite everyone involved knowing the“crime” was fictitious, was stressful and exhausting. Indeed, since Lilith and Irealizedthat the investigation was agenda-, not fact-driven, we had no way of knowingwhatfate was intended for us. We considered it entirely possible that we would bemurdered“accidentally” to prevent the extent of the felonies committed against us frombeingexposed.Defending yourself in a series of governmental criminal investigations requiresmuch more than personal initiative and articulation. Legal representation duringtheentire ordeal exceeded $200,000 [in 1980s funds], forcing us to liquidate manyof ourretirement savings and assets.The international media circus caused by the A-T scam also inspired years of“copycat” allegations and defamation, all as baseless as A-T’s original, fromthe lunaticfringe. We routinely receive death-threats to this day; before the A-T scam,despite ourunusual and exotic religion, there had been none.But this is not a perfect world, nor is there usually perfect justice. Neitherthe UnitedStates Army nor Lilith & I had asked for or anticipated this entire nightmare.All thingsconsidered, it came out as well as could be expected given the harsh politics ofthe “realworld” at that time.- 154 -In the last analysis the FBI, the SFPD, and the U.S. Army did well by Lilith andmyself in the face of a completely unexpected and out-of-control national“satanicritual abuse” witch-hunt mania. The FBI eventually issued an authoritativeresearchpaper discrediting the “SRA” urban myth, 158 the SFPD disbanded the“intelligence”office which had misguided its own investigations, and the Army stood by me asanofficer throughout the rest of my career and subsequent Reserve retirement.I have written this book in 2014, twenty-seven years after our ordeal began,neitherto complain nor to boast, but rather just to set down what actually happened,for thebenefit of anyone who may have heard about and/or been interested in any ofthis. Sohere are the facts; here are the documents. And that’s it.158 Supervisory Special Agent Kenneth V. Lanning, Investigator’s Guide toAllegations of “Ritual”Child Abuse. Quantico, VA: Behavioral Sciences Unit, National Center for theAnalysis of ViolentCrime, FBI Academy, January 1992.- 155 -Appendix 1: Michelle Remembers“The Debunking of a Myth: Why the Original ‘Ritual Abuse’ Victim MayHave Suffered Only from her Childhood Fantasies”- by Denna Allen & Janet MidwinterVictoria, British ColumbiaThe Mail on SundayLondon, EnglandSeptember 30, 1990Page 41Michelle Pazder is a plump, middle-aged woman with one daughter. She has anordinary nine-to-five job working as a receptionist in her husband’s surgery intheCanadian provincial town of Victoria, British Columbia. Yet, incredible as itseems,Michelle Pazder is a key figure in the current Satanic abuse controversy to whomtheextraordinary happenings in England can be directly linked.Thirteen years ago she lay on a psychiatrist’s couch and poured out tales ofsuchunimaginable horror that the Vatican launched an investigation and Hollywoodofferedher a film contract. Michelle described how, as a five-year-old, she had beenoffered toSatan. From deep inside her mind came memories long buried: How she hadwitnesseddebauchery, murder and the sacrifice of babies, the mutilation of snakes andkittens.How she was made to drink blood at the altar of Satan. Her torment was to lastnearlytwo years. And she named the person guilty of giving her to the Devil - her ownmother.The psychiatrist who recorded all this in many months of therapeutic sessionswasDr. Larry Pazder. Both were married to other people. He is now her husband. ThePazders’ book, Michelle Remembers, was an immediate international best-seller.But,more importantly, many child care experts believe it was the “seed work” whichbeganthe current wave of hysteria about Satanists. Robert Hicks of the U.S. JusticeDepartment said: “Before Michelle Remembers there were no Satanic prosecutionsinvolving children. Now the myth is everywhere.”The book was pounced upon by fundamentalist Christian groups, interest spreadlike wildfire across the States, and the crusade crossed last year to England.Animportant conference at Reading University, attended by social workers from alloverthe country, heard “experts” describing Michelle’s experiences.It was Dr. Pazder who coined the phrase “ritual abuse”, which has been used bytheRochdale Social Services Department to justify their drastic action in taking 16childreninto care.But did Michelle, now aged 40, tell the truth? Did these things actuallyphysicallyhappen to her? Is Michelle Remembers, published in this country by MichaelJoseph- 156 -and now being treated with such respect by a powerful child welfare lobby, fact- orfiction? For the past two weeks Mail on Sunday reporters have beeninvestigating.Dr. Pazder, who has since been consulted in more than 1,000 “ritual abuse”cases,was reluctant to speak to us at length. He would not allow us access toMichelle, hiswife and star witness. He said: “For Michelle to go on talking about thesethings is toopainful. She is totally free of Satan today. She is a wonderful person, full offreedomand love.”But every other witness we have interviewed described these happenings as “thehysterical ravings of an uncontrolled imagination”.Some, including a Roman Catholic bishop, give Michelle the benefit of the doubt-that she did genuinely believe these things happened to her. But they are firmlyconvinced that, in real life, they did not - and have to be explained as theworkings ofher subconscious.In the book Michelle says she was introduced to the Satanic ring by her motherinthe basement of her home in 1955. She was just five.Dr. Pazder conceals the family’s true identity and home address. But wediscoveredshe was the daughter of Jack and Virginia Proby, who lived with Michelle’s twosistersat 2078 Newton Street, Victoria - a white-painted house, set among neat hedgesandsuburban lawns.The first witness is Michelle’s father, Jack Proby. Mr Proby, now 74, admits hewasnot the perfect father, and it was a difficult marriage. But he is outraged atwhatMichelle and her psychiatrist have done to the memory of his wife, who died in1963:It was the worst pack of lies a little girl could ever make up. The book took mefourmonths to read, and I cried all the time. I kept saying to myself: “Dear God,how couldanyone do this to their dead mother?”There never was a woman on this earth who worked harder for herdaughters. There was no hanky panky or devil-worshipping.I asked my lawyer if I could sue them. He said I would win, but it would cost me$5,000. So instead I took out a Notice of Intent against their publisher, whichmeant ifthey ever went beyond a literary contract I would sue. That meant they couldn’tget theirmovie deal.Mr. Proby itemized, as examples, three specific points where he says Michellelied:Book:Michelle said she had no religious upbringing.Father: “She went to church every Sunday with her mother and sisters. The threeofthem were confirmed together.”Book:Michelle said she was twice poisoned during Satanic rites.Father: “She was treated for poisoning, but it had nothing to do withdevil-worship.Once she drank turps and paint mixture while I was cleaning my brushes.Another time she ate shoe polish.”- 157 -Book:Michelle describes a horrible car accident which was re-lived by the devil-worshippers in which Satan himself appears.Father: “What I do recall was us once coming across a fatal crash in our car. Wesaw twocars smashed together, and a woman lying in the road bleeding to death. Herintestines were hanging out, and it was a horrible sight. Michelle started toscream, and we could not stop her for ages.”Mr. Proby’s testimony is backed by several independent witnesses. Dr. AndrewGillespie, who was the family doctor, said, “I believe it was something shepictured in alot of conversations with Dr. Pazder and an over-active imagination. I rememberhermother as a kindly woman. She died of cancer when Michelle was 14. There wereseveral poisoning episodes in which the children got into mischief, but theywere notserious.”A neighbor, Alice Okerstrom, agrees. “I dismissed the book as crazy. The motherwasa nice, gracious lady. A little girl could not have been tortured withoutsomeonehearing.”Diana Lockyer, whose husband was head of the cancer unit at the local hospital,wasa close friend of the Probys. She too was “outraged” at the book. Her daughterGillianwas Michelle’s best friend. Gillian said: “Virginia was like a second mother tome. Icertainly never had a bad feeling about her.”The next important witness is Michelle’s first husband, Doug Smith, a charteredsurveyor. Although he would not speak to us directly, a close friend said he wasextremely bitter. Not once during their marriage or the birth of their daughterdidMichelle ever mention her experience, which included such hideous psychologicaltorture as being imprisoned in a cage with live snakes and being forced to eat asoup ofworms.Michelle went to Dr. Pazder for therapy sessions and eventually left herhusband. DrPazder was also married, with four children.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police says there has never been one prosecution inVictoria for Satanic practices. And a Canadian author who is an expert on theoccult,Jean Kozocari, said. “There was never any Satanism in Victoria in the 1950s. Themostinteresting group there were wife swappers.”Finally the conclusions of the Roman Catholic Church: When the book firstappeared, Bishop Remi de Roo spent many hours interviewing Michelle andlisteningto tapes of her therapeutic sessions. He then arranged for her to fly to theVatican tomeet Cardinal Sergio Pignedoli, then head of the Secretariat for Non-Christians.When the book was published in 1977, the Bishop wrote in a preface: “I do notquestion that for Michelle the experience was real. In time we will know howmuch of itcan be validated. It will require prolonged and careful study. In suchmysteriousmatters hasty conclusions could prove unwise.”In the meantime “ritual abuse” become a buzz-phrase among social workers, whobelieve that Michelle and her doctor bravely lifted the lid on practices whichhad goingon for years without outsiders realizing it.- 158 -So what does the Roman Catholic Church now believe? Bishop de Roo’s office toldus, “He wants to distance himself from these people. More than ten years ago heaskedthe couple to provide him with details, but they never supplied all theinformation herequired.”Dr. Pazder himself admits he is working in areas that are difficult to define.“It’s anarea where if you jump in too quickly, you get hysteria. People start seeingSatanistsaround every corner.”He says Michelle Remembers gave victims a voice to be heard and not be labeledcrazy.We then asked Dr Pazder, “Does it matter if it was true, or is the fact thatMichellebelieved it happened to her the most important thing?”He replied: “Yes, that’s right. It is a real experience. If you talk to Michelletoday, shewill say, ‘That’s what I remember.’ We still leave the question open. For her itwas veryreal. Every case I hear I have skepticism. You have to complete a long course oftherapybefore you can come to conclusions. We are all eager to prove or disprove whathappened, but in the end it doesn’t matter.”One wonders what the parents of Rochdale would have to say about that!- 159 -Appendix 2: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #1A Presumption of Guilt: “Warped” Child, Twisted Justice- by A.S. Ross- Paul Avery contributed to this reportSan Francisco ExaminerSunday, September 28, 1986, page #A-1Allegations of ritualistic child abuse have been cropping up in police reports,therapists’ files, and child welfare caseloads nationwide. They have taken adestructive toll of accused and accuser. This is the first of two Examinerreports on thepursuit of these allegations. Today: How cases are being mishandled.My God, what has happened to our community? People are asking, Have we gotsexual abuse that has turned into a horrible cancer - murders, Satanic cults? Ordo wehave brainwashed children Accusing innocent persons of nonexistent crimes?- Glenn Cole, Foreman of the 1984-85 Kern County Grand JuryThe same question asked by Glenn Cole has been raised in dozens of other U.S.communities as hundreds of children have leveled bizarre accusations of sexualabuse,Satanic rituals, and grotesque murders against preschool teachers, baby sitters,neighbors, family, and friends.From Bay Area suburbs and southern California beach communities to small townsin the Midwest and working-class neighborhoods in the South, authorities havespentmillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of hours trying to find theanswer.Mostly they have not succeeded. Tomorrow the California Attorney General willreleaseresults of an unprecedented, nine-month investigation of a Kern County mass-molestation case. It is expected to be highly critical of the authorities’handling of thecase.Kern County became a textbook example of how so-called ritualistic child-abusecases, inflated by overzealous investigators with little hard evidence, haveseeminglycareened out of control. At the height of the county’s 18-month probe into whathasbeen called the “Gonzales-Thomas molestation ring”, nearly 80 adults wereimplicatedand more than two dozen children said to have been killed in Satanic ceremonies.Sheriff’s deputies dragged lakes, dug up back yards, and searched homes lookingforbodies. They found none, nor any other evidence of murder, but they did chargesixpeople with child molestation.Successive grand juries have already harshly criticized the Sheriff’s Departmentandthe county’s Child Protective Services. The 1984-85 grand jury accused them,amongother things, of leaking children’s testimony to local service clubs and churchgroupsbefore charges had been brought. The 1985-86 grand jury, went further, echoingcriticisms made of several similar cases across the country: “A presumption ofguilt- 160 -appeared to pervade the transcripts available within the Welfare Department casefiles,and guilt by association was sufficient to bring charges against individuals.”Superior Court Judge Robert Baca angrily blames authorities for making thechildren involved “virtual prisoners” who were “brainwashed” to shore up shakymolestation cases against the adults. “The molestation, if there was, is notwhat causedthis warped child,” Baca said of 9-year-old Michael Nokes, a key witness in thecase.“The blame is on the system. For the sake of the prosecution’s case, this childwas takeninto the system and completely warped.”The Widening CircleLike similar cases with ritualistic overtones in Los Angeles, Sacramento, andMemphis, the Kern County case started out small enough. In June 1984 GerardoGonzales, a 29-year-old mechanic, was arrested after 5-year-old Brooke Hastingstoldauthorities that Gonzales and a man she knew as “Thomas” had molested her and afriend three times. Under separate interrogation, Gonzales’ 6-year-old daughterMelissa said her father had abused her and her 3-year-old brother Tyson. Sheidentifiedthe other man as Will Thomas, a local preacher and Gonzales’ karate instructor.Gonzales has been in county jail awaiting trial ever since. Thomas is free on$50,000bail.The case had problems from the outset. According to Kern County Sheriff’s files,Brooke twice failed to identify Thomas from a photograph, and Tyson at one pointtoldinvestigators that Brooke was “lying”. More significantly, at a preliminaryhearing forGonzales and his wife Cheryl, who had also been charged, Melissa deniedrepeatedly -over two days of questioning - that she had been molested. Asked why sheoriginallysaid she had been, Melissa replied: “First I said they didn’t. Then he (aSheriff’s deputy)said they didn’t believe me, so I had to say they did happen.”Nonetheless the investigation proceeded. More adults were named; more childrenwere taken from parents and placed in county shelters and foster homes. Freshstoriesemerged of drugs, boards, chains, and handcuffs. Photographs were said to havebeentaken, but none was ever found.Among the ever-widening circle of adults being accused were Michael Nokes’parents: Brad, 28, an oil-rig operator and Mary, 32. They were charged after a7-year-old girl identified Mary Nokes as the wife of “the man with the pony tail” whohadallegedly molested the girl and other children. In the course of hundreds ofinterrogations, Michael Nokes was to tell investigators that he was molested onscoresof occasions by dozens of adults - including his parents, aunts, uncles,grandparents,family friends, ministers, a Child Protective Service worker, and an assistantdistrictattorney. But his early and repeated denials that he had been molested, recordsshow,were ignored. On one occasion, according to a Sheriff’s report, Michael saidthat he hadlied about the molestations because CPS worker Cory Taylor told him to. Michaeladded that he had not told the truth because “he didn’t think Cory would believehim”.- 161 -In a tape-recorded interview with a detective hired by the Nokes family, Michaelsaid Taylor told him she knew he had been molested, and she told him to “tell itorwe’re going to sit in this room all day until you do”.“I just don’t recall it,“ Taylor said in an interview. “I’m sure I wouldn’t havesaidthose things.” Taylor, who interviewed Michael twice, said she felt the two ofthem “justdidn’t hit it off”. At a recent court hearing, Michael’s therapist, Dr. JayFisher, said suchinterviewing techniques would have a “profound negative effect” and may havebeenwhy Michael later named Taylor as an abuser as well.By March 1985 Michael’s stories, and those of Melissa Gonzales and several otherchildren, had progressed from the incredible to the grotesque to thehallucinatory. In aMarch 21 report, Michael told investigators that children were taken to WillThomas’church to “pray to the Devil”. The assembled adults, according to Michael’stestimony,smeared the children with excrement, forced them to drink blood, and sacrificedanimals, including birds, cats, dogs, turtles, snakes, wolves, and a “babybear”.Two weeks later the stories turned to killing humans. In one episode, Michaelsaid,he, Melissa, and the adults hurled knives into one of Michael’s cousins. “Onceall theknives were thrown by the adults and the chanting was over,” according toMichael’stestimony as described in an investigator’s report, “that baby Jonathan’s headlookedlike the ring that was around Jesus’ head.”Altogether 77 Bakersfield adults were swept up by the bewildering allegations.Theywere supposed to have stabbed to death as many as 29 infants, burned them infire-pits, and even eaten some of them. Investigators seemed to dismiss charges byparents,defense attorneys, and grand jury members that such stories were childishfantasies,perhaps embellished in therapy sessions.The Sheriff’s Department’s exhaustive search for evidence of ritual murdercontinued, only to come up dry. “Baby Jonathan”, now 3-1/2, along with otherchildrenidentified by Michael and others as being murdered, is alive and at home withhisparents - who had at one time been accused of being part of the Satanic ring.Threemonths after the Satanic stories surfaced, in the wake of a collapsinginvestigation, thegrand jury asked the state Attorney General to enter the case.The Reckoning“I still believe the children were telling the truth,” said Sheriff LarryKleier. “Theydon’t tell these ritualistic things out of nowhere.” Sheriff’s Lt. Brad Darling,whoheaded the county’s Satanic task force, believes a malignant group of Satanistswhoallegedly left dead dogs on detectives’ front porches and used “divide andconquertactics” helped stymie the investigation.Last October District Attorney Edward Jagels declared the investigation“essentiallycomplete”. During the probe 21 children were removed from their parents. Five ofthem, including Michael Nokes, his younger sister Angela, and Melissa Gonzales,haveseen little or nothing of their parents since then.- 162 -Fifteen adults, including the six defendants, voluntarily took and passedlie-detectortests. Gerardo and Cheryl Gonzales and Will Thomas still face more than 40countseach of child molestation. Their trial is scheduled to begin October 27.Leroy George Stowe, Jr., a hospital technician, was sentenced to 30 years inprisonafter a jury, persuaded by testimony of Michael Nokes and Stowe’s youngest son,convicted him in March 1985 of abusing one of his three children. But soon afterStoweentered Folsom Prison, Judge Baca released him on bail pending appeal whenquestions arose about Michael’s credibility.Brad and Mary Nokes face 133 counts of child abuse, charges that were reinstatedinJuly by a state appeals court. A lower court dismissed the charges in May 1985after thecounty welfare department would not let defense doctors physically examineMichael.In a Catch-22 ruling, the appeals court said such an examination might have beentootraumatic for Michael if he had already been abused. “I really don’t know whatthey puthim through,” said Mary Nokes, who has not seen Michael for more than 18 months.“Ican only guess.”One person who is familiar with Michael’s ordeal is Marge Judd, his currentfostermother. “I don’t know any more than any of you as to what traumatized MichaelNokes,” she said, “but I’m the woman that holds him at 2 in the morning when heisscreaming in his bed, when he is saying, ‘Make them leave me alone, Mom. Getthemaway.’ I don’t know who he is talking about any more than you do. I just knowthat thislittle boy, something is scaring him very much.”- 163 -Appendix 3: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #2Satanism or Mass Hysteria?Experts Split on Reasons for Rise in Abuse Cases- by A.S. Ross- Ivan Sharpe contributed to this reportSan Francisco Examiner - Sunday, September 28, 1986, page #A-8.Child-abuse cases tinged with ritualistic or Satanic overtones have sprung upallover the country in the last three years. In California and eight other states,anExaminer survey has found that 13 cases have reached court and at least 17 morehavebeen investigated.Police, therapists, and children’s advocates believe that Satanic rings aremolestingand killing children as part of some grotesque ritual. Defense attorneys andreligiousscholars accuse the authorities of creating a climate reminiscent of the17th-centurySalem witch trials.Caught in the middle are traumatized children; jailed, emotionally-shattered,andeconomically-ruined parents; and a legal system unable to cope with a phenomenonnobody understands. But while many of the investigations, usually based onuncorroborated testimony of children, have collapsed for lack of physicalevidence, soothers have arisen.The first such case to surface was the McMartin Preschool case in Los Angeles.Thenational coverage given to its lurid allegations of “naked movie-star games” andreferences to robes and candles may have triggered a rash of “copy cat”allegations,some observers believe.Key law-enforcement offers offer a grimmer explanation. “For some reason, in the1980s,” said San Francisco Police Officer Sandra Gallant, “children are beingsexuallyabused and possibly even murdered during what appears to be Satanic-typerituals.”Gallant, regarded as an expert on occult crimes by other law-enforcementagencies, hascalled for a task force to combat what she regards as a nationwide conspiracy.Others dispute her views. “I’m afraid what we’re seeing is mass hysteria,” saidEvangeline Brown, a Contra Costa County deputy public defender who represented aConcord man accused of molesting his 7-year-old daughter during Satanic rites.“I’mconvinced there are many people being wrongly accused in this climate of fear.”A review of court documents and police reports, and interviews with parents,children, and law-enforcement officials indicate that most of these cases haverestedsolely on the unsubstantiated word of children. Often investigators have taintedcasesby asking children leading questions and prematurely disclosing rumors toalready-fearful parents. “It’s been an atrocity the way these cases have been handled,”said DonCasey, a Dade County, Florida assistant district attorney. Last October Caseygained- 164 -one of the few convictions in a ritualistic child-abuse case, involving ababy-sittingservice operator in Miami.The greatest difficulty for investigators is that, with rare exceptions, therehas beenno physical evidence to support the children’s stories of rituals, drugs,costumes, andhuman and animal sacrifices. Photographs the children say were taken have neverbeenfound. Supposed murder victim, have turned up alive. “It’s difficult with4-year-olds,”said an investigator connected to the Fort Bragg case. “Our problem is to try tosort outwhat’s real and what’s imagined.”The human toll of these investigations, wherever they have led, has been high.• The daughters of a Sacramento restaurant manager, whom the children accused ofbeing involved in human sacrifices and of making “snuff” films, suffer from whatdoctors describe as “severe emotional trauma”. They are confined to psychiatrictreatment centers in San Francisco - at a cost to taxpayers of more than$300,000.Last October a judge dismissed charges against the father, Gary Dill, and fourotherdefendants. The judge said the girls were victims of their “severely mentallyill”grandmother, who had planted the stories in their heads. Dill now has a $5/hourautoparts job in San Francisco. He has seen his children once in three years.Sacramento attorney Wade Thompson, who represents Dill, said the daughters maynever recover fully. “You hate to say any human beings are beyond repair,” hesaid.“But the chances of these kids returning to normalcy are slim to none.”• Millions of dollars in civil suits are still pending against Scott County,Minnesotaauthorities in a case labeled a “tragedy” by state Attorney General Hubert H.Humphrey III. Grim stories of murder, kidnapping, and mutilation involving morethan 60 adults and more than 100 children surfaced 2-1/2 years ago in the tinyMinnesota River Valley town of Jordan. The FBI and state investigatorsultimatelydetermined the stories were fabricated. At one point 24 adults were charged withavariety of child-abuse felonies. Only one was convicted after confessing.The state Attorney General’s report said that the case suffered from a“fundamentallack of evidence” and “prolonged interrogation” of the children that resulted in“confusion between fact and fantasy”. The case is returning to haunt Jordan. Theprosecutor, R. Kathleen Morris, who at one point faced impeachment proceedings,isrunning for election as Scott County District Attorney in November. Her opponenthasbeen using the handling of the Jordan case as an issue. Morris still believesthe storiesand says, “If it hadn’t been for the press, these kids wouldn’t have beenreturned totheir parents.”• Failure to prosecute purported Satanic child molesters in Los Angeles and FortBragg has left parents frightened and bitter. A number have moved. “I knowsomethingterrible happened to my daughter,” said Audrey Sullins, a 35-year-old Fort Braggmother who believes her 4-year-old daughter was used in gruesome ritualsinvolving- 165 -crosses and coffins. A four-month Mendocino County Sheriff’s investigation lastyearturned up no physical evidence and resulted in no arrests.• Six of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Preschool molestationcase inLos Angeles have lost their homes and been declared legally indigent. In thewake ofthe longest - and at $4 million the most expensive - pretrial proceeding inCalifornia,five of the accused were freed last January after the district attorney decidedthe caseagainst them was “incredibly weak”. The two remaining defendants face trial nextmonth on more than 100 counts of molestation.In the face of such problems, some prosecutors are attempting to play downSatanicallegations, convinced that such stories harm what they regard asotherwise-provablechild-abuse cases.In the 1985 Concord case, in which jurors deadlocked 6-6, Deputy DistrictAttorneyHal Jewett said jurors who voted for acquittal later told him they did notbelieve thegirl’s allegations of devil-worship and murder. “I wanted the jury to focus onchildsexual abuse. I wanted to de-emphasize the Satanic aspect as much as possible,”Jewettsaid. “But it was something you either had to swallow whole or reject whole. Ihadabsolutely nothing to corroborate the girl’s stories of Satanic worship. I haveno doubtthat, if she hadn’t talked about that, they would have believed she was a victimofmolestation.”“We’re doing children a disservice if we bring these cases to court only to seethemdismissed,” said Rita Swann of CHILD, Inc., a children’s advocacy group based inSiouxCity, Iowa. “To bandy about charges that can’t be substantiated ... will makethe publiccynical about the issue, and make them less likely to believe a child’s story ofsexualabuse in the future.”[index-165_1.png]- 166 -[index-166_1.png]- 167 -- 168 -Appendix 4: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #3Going to Trial despite a Questionable Probe- by A.S. RossSan Francisco Examine r - Sunday, September 28, 1986, page #A-8.Investigators knew they had problems with the Georgian Hills Baptist Church caselong before it went to court. A confidential memo to the FBI written by twoMemphisinvestigators, dated February 5, 1985, and obtained by the Examiner, said theallegations were “so irrational and so unbelievable” that “nothing has surfacedthatconnects anybody to the criminal act”.The case began with the June 1984 arrest on molestation charges of FrancisBallard,54, a former Georgian Hills teacher. Particularly shocking to the parishionersof whatone described as a “conservative, Bible-preaching church” were publicizedaccounts ofthe children, who said that they were drugged, filmed, burned with candles, andlockedin cages. They reportedly saw animals slain, and said their parents’ lives werethreatened if they told the “secret”.But, the memo said, because of the difficulties of interviewing children soyoung,“they required a lot more leading than would be desirable with older victims”.Also, thememo said, some parents probably “coerced or improperly extracted” informationfromtheir children. The memo also said: “When re-questioned, those children who haddenied (being molested) ... admitted to also being abused.”Yet three months after the memo was written, the pastor of the church, the Rev.Paul Shell, 65; part-time teacher Betty Stimpson; and her son Jeff, 24, wereindicted bya grand jury on 14 counts of aggravated rape involving 26 children ages 2-5.As in most cases of this sort, the children’s testimony is the crux of theprosecution’sevidence. The defense is likely to challenge how that testimony was obtained.Dr. BenBursten, Chairman of the Psychiatry Department of the University of Tennessee,wasasked by prosecution to listen to tapes of one child being interviewed byauthorities. Ina court affidavit he was highly critical of their methods. “In my opinion,” hesaid, “theinterviewers put words in the child’s mouth. They virtually accused the child ofholdingback secrets when the information they wished was not forthcoming.”In a telephone interview, Bursten said one investigator told a child, “I canlook inyour eyes and tell what you know,” and then, “Unless you tell it, it is alwaysin there.”“That is a terrible thing to say to a young child who is led to believe adultscanmagically ferret inside their minds,” he said.A prosecution psychiatrist defended the technique, saying children are unlikelytomake spontaneous disclosures of abuse to parents or investigators.Asked how strong a case he thought there was, an assistant prosecutor said, “Ifrankly do not know ... It’s just going to be the kids. Their credibility isgoing to be themajor issue in this case.” A trial date is pending.- 169 -Appendix 5: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #4A Presumption of Guilt: Child-Abuse Cults: How Real?Experts are divided over credibility of children’s testimony.- by A.S. Ross- Ivan Sharpe contributed to this reportSan Francisco Examiner - Monday, September 29, 1986, page #A-1."},{"pageContent":"Allegations of ritualistic child abuse have been cropping up in police reports,therapists’ files, and child-welfare caseloads nationwide. They have taken adestructive toll of accused and accusers alike. This is the second of twoExaminerreports on the pursuit of these allegations. Today: The search for Sataniccults.The eerie phenomenon of young children branding teachers, parents, and familyfriends as murderous devil-worshippers over the past three years has defiedclearexplanation. Court cases and investigations throughout California and the nationhavecrumbled either for lack of evidence or because of bizarre, unbelievabletestimony.But to a core of police investigators and child advocates, ritualistic andSatanic childabuse is the latest twist in the long history of crimes against children. Theycomparetheir lack of success in proving it exists to the societal skepticism thatsurroundedallegations of incest in the not-so-distant past. “I predict in five years thecourts willbelieve children when they say they are involved in Satanic rituals,” saidSandra Bakerof the Sacramento Child Sexual Abuse Treatment Program.San Francisco Police intelligence Officer Sandra Gallant agrees. “It can’t bejustcoincidence that kids are telling the same stories across the country,” saidGallant,whom other law-enforcement agencies regard as an expert on “Satanic” crimes.“Therituals are detailed and very consistent. A young child could not make them up.”Disbelievers, however, say that is precisely what the children are doing. “Thephenomenology of the Salem witch trials is being created all over again,” saidtheologian Aidan Kelly of Holy Family College in San Mateo. “That is, innocentadultsare being accused by hysterical children.”Like the religious cult debates of the 1970s, groups of competing experts havetraveled around the country, proclaiming their views in courts, communitymeetings,and television studios. “Talk of Satanic child-abuse has become the pop-art ofthechild-abuse field,” said Aline Kidd, a psychology professor at Mills College.Child-abuse cases with ritualistic or Satanic overtones have figured in 13 courtcasesin California and eight other states. At least 17 more have been investigated.But intheir pursuit of answers, investigators and child advocates have been relyingon, andconveying to other agencies, information and sources that are often questionable- andsometimes wrong. Critics say that such misinformation adds to the fear andconfusion.For example:- 170 -• The prosecutor in a forthcoming ritualistic child-abuse case said she hadrelied ona book written by Canadian psychiatrist Larry Pazder for background informationonthe subject. The book, Michelle Remembers, is a synthesis of taped psychotherapysessions in which a patient of Pazder’s recalls fantastically grotesquechildhoodmemories of being in a Satanic cult that, among other things, cut up bodies andstitched them back together in bizarre anatomical configurations.No corroborating evidence has ever been offered to support the stories. “It wasMichelle’s fantasy, and Pazder encouraged it,” said Gordon Melton, Director oftheInstitute for the Study of American Religions at the University of California,SantaBarbara.Nonetheless Pazder said in an interview that he has acted as a consultant to theLosAngeles Police Department and to parents throughout the country.• Child advocate Ken Wooden said on a Phil Donahue television show on Satanismthat there was evidence people were “committing what appears to be humansacrificesand incredible child abuse. I mean incredible tales of kids being molested whilein theincubator, little babies.” Asked during an interview what the evidence was tosupportsuch startling statements, Wooden said: “All I know is I’m getting similarstories fromlittle kids all over the country, telling me similar things.” Asked what otherevidencethere might be, Wooden replied, “Their drawings, their knowledge, theirsophistication.”(Wooden is the founder of the National Coalition for Children’s Justice. He co-produced an ABC News 20/20 segment entitled “The Devil Worshippers”, which waslargely devoted to ritualistic child abuse, in May 1985. He also mailed adetailedquestionnaire on what to look for in ritualistic abuse cases to 3,500prosecutingattorneys across the country last year.)One Pennsylvania prosecutor, who called Wooden “my mentor”, said he had sent hisown investigators to be “debriefed” by Wooden after a child-abuse case withritualisticovertones surfaced near Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania last year.There have also been instances of police investigators’ passing on to otherconcernedgroups erroneous information on current cases.Kern County Sheriff’s Lt. Brad Darling told a child-abuse symposium in San Joselast April that tests at the home of a family suspected of being involved inmassmolestations and child murders revealed evidence of “blood spatters, bloodsmears,and blood wiped away ... wherever the children said they occurred”. Darling, whoheaded Kern County’s Satanic child-abuse task force for five months last year,told LosAngeles County Sheriff’s investigators the same thing in May 1985, according toapolice memo obtained by the Examiner. At the time the L.A. authorities wereinvestigating a rash of ritualistic child-abuse allegations that had surfaced inthe wakeof the celebrated McMartin Preschool case.- 171 -However a May 25, 1985 Kern County laboratory report obtained by the Examinerstated that its tests of the areas were “negative”. In an interview Darlingexpressedsurprise about the lab report.At the San Jose symposium, according to a transcript of his remarks obtained bytheExaminer, Darling had also said that, during the Kern County investigation, it“seem(ed) almost like SOP (Standard Operating Procedure). You got up, and youpicked the dead dog up off your porch, or the dead chicken, or whatever it was... theyanointed your house with over the evening.” In an interview he said he had heardthatdead chickens had been found at a detective’s house “two or three times”, andthat adead dog had been found once outside of a therapist’s house.In Kern County stories of Satanic rituals had circulated in individual and grouptherapy sessions attended by allegedly-molested children. Explaining thestories,Carolyn Heim, the children’s therapist, once told a reporter that she believedsome ofthe allegedly-sacrificed children were what she called “altar babies”. “An altarbaby is ababy that is conceived for the purpose of sacrifice,” Heim said. “That is a homebirth;there is never a recorded birth certificate.”That such bizarre and unsupported notions have gained credence amonginvestigators, critics say, does not reflect a new wave of religioussuperstition but ratherwhat defense attorney Walter Urban has called “the burgeoning child-abuseindustry”.“The whole thinking is that there is a huge number of pedophiles in the UnitedStateswho were virtually unheard-of and totally unknown until the ‘experts’ discoveredthem,“ said Urban, who defended preschool teacher Betty Raidor in the McMartincase.“They won’t accept a denial from the children that nothing happened becausethey’rethe ‘experts’,” he said. “They say, ‘I know something happened. You’re justafraid to tellme.’ And all of a sudden the kid’s starting to roll.”Referring to techniques he saw used by therapists in videotaped interviews withchildren in the McMartin case, Urban said: “The children are encouraged to play;they’re encouraged to freely associate. And all of a sudden you have kidstalking theway kids do. They talk about monsters and bodies and blood and kill, kill,kill.”Others have pointed to what Kenneth Lanning of the FBI’s Behavioral ResearchUnithas described as a “cross-contamination of ideas” in which children and parentsinvolved in mass-molestation cases compare stories with others.But many child experts say it’s extremely unlikely, if not impossible toinfluencelarge numbers of children into telling similarly-detailed stories. “Besides,”said Dr.Roland Summit, a psychologist attached to UCLA-Harbor Medical Center, “there isnoprofessional in the world that I know of who would come up with a screwballstory ...(or) implant something in the child ... that could lead to criminal charges.”Despite the collapse of so many ritual abuse cases, Summit and others stillbelievethe events took place. Sacramento County District Attorney Rich Lewkowitz saidthedismissal of charges in Sacramento’s “snuff film” abuse case last year“reinforces abelief in my mind ... that there is an entrenched prejudice to disbelievechildren,especially when it has to do with something gruesome and horrific.”- 172 -They point to the conviction of a Miami baby-sitting service operator lastDecemberas evidence that ritualistic abuse is real. The County Walk Babysitting Service,up to ayear ago, was apparently the scene of nightmarish abuse, involving masks, feces&urine, and a “cut off your head” game, according to court testimony thatresulted in alife term for Cuban ex-convict Francisco Fuster. Fuster’s wife testified that heraped herwith a cross and strung her up on a punching bag in front of the children.Prosecutorstold the Examiner that even more bizarre and grotesque allegations were kept outofthe trial for fear of jeopardizing the case.But how typical these cases are, and whether they are the work of isolatedindividuals or of organized groups, is disputed. “It’s probably small groups ofadultsdoing it as part of a sexual perversion,” said San Francisco FBI Agent JoeDavidson,who was assigned last year to help keep track of ritual child-abuse cases. “It’sabrainwashing type of technique used to scare and control the kids and members ofthegroup.”Some academic observers agree. William Holmes of Northeastern University’sCenter for Applied Social Research has closely studied a case in Maiden,Massachusetts, where a day-care worker was recently convicted of molestingchildrenwhile dressed in a clown suit. He said the use of “mystical elements” likecostumes andmasks in child abuse “is not done just for the sexual pleasure, but for thedomination ofa helpless victim ... to assert the authority of whoever is in charge.”“I don’t think we need to worry about a Satanic conspiracy,” said ProfessorJeffreyBurton Russell of UC Santa Barbara, author of a four-volume work on the historyof theDevil. “I do think we need to worry, like we’ve always had to, about individualpsychopathic people roaming around.”- 173 -Appendix 6: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #5How the Specter of Satanism led to L.A. Uproar in Child Care- by Ivan SharpeSan Francisco Examiner - Monday, September 29, 1986, page #A-6.LOS ANGELES - Parents dug for bones, played detective in sleazy bars, trailedsuspects, crept through graveyards at night, and threatened vigilante action.Determined to expose what they believe is the Devil’s work, they put up “wanted”posters of suspected Satanic child abusers and offered rewards for pornographicphotosof their children.Preschool owners, teachers, and their attorneys met secretly to share stories ofruined lives. They organized protests and bought full-page newspaper adssuggestingthat children with fertile imaginations could be led into saying anything.From a single allegation of molestation in a respected preschool just south ofLosAngeles, the specter of Satanism was to darken the entire Los Angeles basin. TheSheriff’s Department formed a special task force, and it spent a yearinvestigating thenear-epidemic number of allegations.Both accused and accusers say they have been assaulted, vandalized, andterrorized.And with a blizzard of lawsuits filed, almost everyone involved in Los Angeles’uproarover Satanism seems to be suing everybody else.A Simple BeginningIt was August 1983 when a mother told Manhattan Beach police that her 2-year-oldson allegedly had been molested by “Mr. Ray” at the Virginia McMartin Preschool.Questioned by an investigator, the boy indicated that other children also hadbeenmolested. Further questioning of others produced seemingly unending accounts ofchildren being photographed in the nude.Police were perplexed. Hundreds of children had gone to the 28-year-old McMartinnursery school. Lacking the personnel to interview all of them, police mailedletters toMcMartin parents asking them to question their children about possible abuse attheschool.The stories of weird rituals did not begin to emerge until weeks after therapistKeeMacFarlane and her assistants at the Children’s Institute began talking to thechildrenin September 1983 at the request of the District Attorney’s office.MacFarlane remembers when the stories of ritualism first began. It was a7-year-oldtalking about witches. “I didn’t think much of it,” she said. “I didn’t believeit. Iremember saying to a co-worker that I had a kid who seemed a little delusional.”Initially Virginia McMartin’s grandson, Ray Buckley, was arrested. But he wassoonreleased because of lack of evidence, only to be re-arrested six months lateralong with- 174 -his mother, sister, grandmother, and three former teachers in what then-DistrictAttorney Robert Philibosian, who was running for re-election, hailed as thebiggestchild-molestation case in U.S. history.The counts grew to more than 200 against McMartin, the 77-year-old founder oftheschool; her daughter and co-owner Peggy McMartin Buckley, 27; Peggy Ann Buckley,28; and teachers Betty Raidor, 65; Mary Ann Jackson, 57; & Babette Spitler, 36.The preliminary hearing was an 18-month legal and emotional marathon, thelongest in California history. It cost $4 million and produced 540 volumes oftestimony. Along with allegations of rape and sodomy, episodes in which childrenweresupposedly stripped and photographed during “naked movie star games”, some youngwitnesses testified about hooded adults in churches and graveyards, grotesqueanimalsacrifices, and blood-drinking. The children said they were tortured andterrorized intosilence by the slaughtering of rabbits, turtles, and birds, coupled with threatsagainsttheir parents.Parents were jubilant in January when Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb ordered allseven defendants to stand trial on 135 counts of child sexual molestation andconspiracy.One week later District Attorney Ira Reiner announced that, although he believedthe children had been molested at the school, he was dropping charges againstfive ofthe defendants because the evidence against them was “incredibly weak”. Only RayBuckley and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckley, still stand accused. They arescheduled to be tried October 21 on 100 counts.The Conspiracy TheoryNone of this made any sense to McMartin parents, who launched an unsuccessfuleffort to persuade state Attorney General John Van de Kamp to reinstate thedroppedcharges.Therapist MacFarlane said in an interview that 349 McMartin children haddescribed some kind of sexual abuse. A substantial number, she said, had alsodescribed sadistic rituals.Only 14 eventually testified in court. Some parents did not want to expose theirchildren to the stress of the courtroom, but others later said prosecutors hadtold themtheir children’s stories were too unbelievable. Prosecutors were less thanpleased, forexample, by one child’s account of City Attorney James Hahn and movie star ChuckNorris molesting and whipping children tied to a pole.MacFarlane scoffs at suggestions that she and other therapists brain-washedchildren into repeating startling stories of Satanic rituals. “I was verycautious aboutbringing this up with other children,” she said. “There are some children whofocus onthis as the primary thing, and others who don’t describe anything like that atall. I don’tknow whether that means some were involved and others weren’t.”- 175 -But what skeptics scathingly refer to as the contagion of fantasy, parent groupsdarkly describe as a huge Satanic conspiracy involving morticians and businesspeoplethroughout southern California.The Sheriff’s task force and state Department of Social Services investigatedtheflood of allegations in the wake of the McMartin case at preschools in severalsouthernCalifornia communities, including Torrance, Whittier, Placentia, Covina, andLomita.The task force identified 56 suspects, searched several homes and businesses,andinterviewed 100 adults and several hundred children. Several schools were shutdowntemporarily. But in October 1985, one year and $1 million later, the task forcedisbanded without making a single arrest.Since then some parents have taken matters into their own hands. Last NovemberRobert Currie, 52, the most vocal McMartin parent, vowed at a Hollywood pressconference, with seven young alleged victims hidden behind a curtain, that “wearegoing to show that ritualistic abuse is happening all across the country”. Heset up acomplaint hot-line to exchange information.Currie and other parents then offered a $10,000 reward for pornographic picturesofchildren in the McMartin case. He was arrested for gun possession as he waswaitingfor an informant outside a low-rent Los Angeles nightclub last year.Other parents rented a backhoe and excavated a vacant lot next to the preschool,hoping to substantiate their children’s tales of tunnels and animal sacrifices.Theyunearthed some turtle shells and a few animal bones, which police said provednothing.Two months later Pico Rivera mother Vickie Meyers led another small band ofparents on a dig at the former site of the burned-out Old Molokan Church inNorwalk,where children in another alleged abuse case had supposedly witnessed Satanicsacrifices. They were luckier, uncovering hundreds of sawed bones in trash bags.Butanalysis showed they were animal bones - remains, a church member said, ofmeals.Meyers, her husband, and their three children moved last year after a judgedismissedmolestation charges against two Pico Rivera couples. The judge said one8-year-old boywas lying and another boy had admitted he lied.The ordeal has been traumatic for the children, their parents, and formersuspects.Once, with a reporter present, Meyers’ 7-year-old son Jeffrey tried to chokehimselfwhile en route to testify in the case. “I wanted to kill myself so I wouldn’thave to go tocourt,” he later explained. In the courthouse cafeteria, when his mother andtherapisttried to persuade him to talk to an attorney, he suddenly clasped his hands overhisears, began sobbing, and screamed, “I don’t want to remember.”Fear, quarrels with spouses over children’s behavior, and feelings of revengehavesent many parents to family therapists.Although she is now free, former McMartin defendant Betty Raidor will neverforgetthe red wristband she had to wear in jail to separate her from other inmates. Itbore thewords “Lewd acts with a child”. She and her husband have sold their large homeanddepleted their $45,000 life savings to pay legal expenses. Nonetheless, Raidorsaid, sheharbors no ill will. “I don’t feel bitterness toward anyone,” she said. “I havenothing butaffection and sadness in my heart for the children.”- 176 -Appendix 7: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #6Police Believe in Violent Cults- by A.S.

She also trains federal and local investigators about thesetopics.She is recommended frequently by other law-enforcement agencies as the primaryexpert on ritualistic and Satanic child abuse.Gallant says, “There are just not clear-cut answers” to the phenomenon. “Howmuchof it is real? How much of it is fantasy?” Despite the questions, she firmlybelieves thatmurderous, child-molesting Satanic cults existTestifying in Contra Costa County in May 1985, Gallant, who had been called asanexpert witness in a case involving a 9-year-old girl who had accused herstepfather ofabusing her and killing others in Satanic settings, said that the eating anddrinking ofhuman wastes, ferocious abuse of children, and even human sacrifice are bothpresentand past characteristics of Satanic worship.And in a detailed memo widely circulated among law-enforcement agencies lastyear, Gallant provides a description of a 200-year-old “Satanic Black Mass”whosecelebrants would “cut the child’s throat on the belly of (a naked) woman, andits bloodwill be caught in a chalice. The sacrifice of animals, young children, andinfants wasapparently commonplace,” the memo added. “The stories that we are hearing today,in1985, ring true of the practices held then.”But little evidence has surfaced to support Gallant’s assertions, both then andnow.Many modern historians dismiss the historical description as a myth, and believethat“black masses” - if they took place - were little more than theatrical, ifobsceneparodies. “Yes, there have been sexual psychopaths all through history,” saidhistorianJeffrey Burton Russell of U.C. Santa Barbara. “But the notion of groups or anykind oforganization doing it (ritualistic child abuse) over any period of time -thereis simply noevidence of that.”Gallant acknowledges the difficulties police face investigating allegations ofritualabuse. “The problem is we are not finding any bodies,” she says. “We are notfindingany bodies, period.”Gallant says she is drawing up new guidelines for investigators. “I really feeltheyneed to document the information as soon as they get it,“ she said. “In thepast, theywould not make assumptions that were not proven.”- 177 -Appendix 8: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #7Van de Kamp Rips Probe of Molestation Cases- by Joe Bigham, Associated PressSan Francisco Examiner - Monday, September 29, 1986, page #A-7.BAKERSFiELD - State Attorney General John Van de Kamp said Monday that KernCounty law enforcement and social agencies had mishandled an investigation ofchild-molestation cases that led to unfounded allegations of Satanic child sacrifices.At apress conference in Bakersfield, Van de Kamp called the highly-publicizedinvestigation“one of the most complicated and bizarre in the nation”.The investigation began in June 1985 when Sheriff Larry Kleier said his officewaschecking allegations by a group of molested children that as many as 80 peoplewereinvolved in a Satanic cult that practiced the sacrifice of infants. While somemolestationconvictions were eventually returned, no evidence of any cults or child killingswas everfound.Van de Kamp issued these criticisms:• The Sheriff’s Department did not always perform effectively in its role aschiefinvestigator. The Attorney General said deputies had relinquished control andturnedover the direction of their investigation to people untrained in therequirements ofcriminal law.• Proper procedures for interviewing child witnesses were not followed, reportswereinadequate, and little effort was made to find corroborating evidence.• The District Attorney’s legal assistance to the Sheriff’s Department was “lessthanthorough”.- 178 -Appendix 9: Examiner “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Series #8State Blasts Kern’s Handling of Bizarre Child-Abuse Case- by Paul AverySan Francisco Examiner -September 30, 1986, page #A-1.BAKERSFIELD - Kern County authorities have been severely criticized by stateAttorney General John Van de Kamp for their handling of a bizarre childmolestationcase. He said the findings of a year-long, $500,000 state review of the caseshowed thatthe county Sheriff’s Department, District Attorney’s office, and ChildProtectiveServices unit shared blame for an investigation that got out of hand.The case broke into the news last year. At the time the Kern County SheriffLarryKleier said he was “absolutely convinced“ that a cult of 77 men and women hadsexuallymolested 60 children and murdered as many as 29 infants during devil-worshiprites inBakersfield homes and churches. But Van de Kamp said his investigators -although nottrying “to prove or disprove allegations of Satanic rituals or infanticide” -had foundnothing that backed up Kleier’s oft-repeated statement. “No physical evidencewasfound to substantiate such claims, while indeed much was found to disprovethem,”Van de Kamp said Monday at a crowded news conference in Bakersfield. He releasedan 80-page summary of the state’s review. Also present during the hour-longsession atthe county library were about 100 Bakersfield residents, among them 15 lawyersand 30or so of the people accused, though not charged. Frequent angry and emotionaloutbursts came from the audience. One woman shouted at Van de Kamp that dozensofchildren in Kern County had been “kidnapped from innocent parents” by Sheriff’sdeputies and Child Protective Services workers. Most of the audience applauded.Van de Kamp directed his harshest criticism at the Sheriff’s Department:“Deputiesrelinquished control and direction of their investigation to people untrained intherequirements of criminal law. Proper procedure for interviewing child witnesseswasnot followed. Reports were inadequate. And little effort, and I underscore this,wasmade to find corroborating evidence for children’s statements.”The allegations of Satanic rituals and sacrifices of infants that investigatorsdrew outin interrogations of some of the children “greatly eroded their credibility aswitnesses,”Van de Kamp said. “Many charges depended entirely on the veracity of thechildren.Once that was open to serious question, there could be little thought of takingthosecases to court. Although 77 adults were named as suspects in the case, only sixpersonswere ever arrested and charged with child-molest offenses. One man was convictedandsentenced to state prison for a 30-year term. He is presently free while hiscase is onappeal. The other five men and women charged are awaiting trial.”Kleier’s office said he was unavailable to directly comment on the AttorneyGeneral’sfindings, but Sgt. Randy Raymond, Kleier’s spokesman, later released astatement.“(The Attorney General’s review) offers a number of suggestions that will bereviewed- 179 -and put into effect where necessary and desirable,” the statement read in part.“Childabuse and Satanic worship are not unique to Kern County. We have cooperatedopenlywith the Attorney General in this investigation to hopefully learn better waysofaccomplishing our goals. Be assured that the Kern County Sheriff’s Departmentwillcontinue to investigate and seek prosecution of child molesters and others whoprey onour children.”District Attorney Edward Jagels also was unavailable to comment on the statereview. His secretary said he was “out of town” but wouldn’t say where. Van deKampcriticized Jagels’ office for failing to “press the Sheriff’s Department forbetter reportsand evidence until long after such deficiencies could be easily remedied”.The county’s Department of Human Services, Van de Kamp said, generally “met itsresponsibilities in accordance with state and county policies. Yet one (ChildProtectiveServices) worker contributed greatly to the confusion and unprofessionalismsurrounding the case by assuming the role of criminal rather than civilinvestigator.And the case was further complicated by the unfortunate and poorly documentedinteraction by a number of (alleged) child victims in group therapy.” BillCurbow of theDepartment of Human Services said he felt the review’s findings were accurateand thatnew guidelines and methods of dealing with “these kinds of complicated cases”wouldbe implemented as soon as possible. Van de Kamp’s office entered the case lastyear atthe request of a Kern County grand jury after it investigated the threeagencies’ actions.Additionally many of the individuals accused of taking part in the allegedSatanicrituals and infant murders also asked the Attorney General to investigate.

It is our experience that so-called “open” schools are as prone to Satanicritualabuse as are closed schools. That is, being able to walk directly into theclassroomdoes not guarantee safety. We believe that a “watch” person alerts perpetratorsthata parent is arriving, and the child is quickly produced.2. We have found that several of the offending schools have two-way mirrors intheclassrooms. These are almost never “single perpetrator” cases. Rather, from whatthe children tell us, the whole school seems to be involved. Therefore, theability tolook into the classroom and see what is going on provides no deterrent.- 186 -3. Personnel at offending schools usually do not seem obviously “strange”. Afterachild discloses abuse at the school, the parent rarely thinks in retrospect thatsheshould have suspected it based on the teachers’ behavior. Some personnel atoffending schools may even be. exceptionally “solicitous” of the child’sacademicprogress. When the child does not progress (because (s)he is being abused) theschool may recommend (s)he be retained an extra year.4. The expense, prestige, religious or educational affiliation of a preschoolseem toprovide no assurance that the school is safe. Children from expensive,prestigiouspreschools have made extensive arid detailed allegations of abuse. Similarly,children from college and university affiliated preschools have alleged abuse.Religiously affiliated preschools have also numbered among the offenders.5. Satanic ritual abusers tend to infiltrate preschools in clusters, bygeographic area.As in the case of the South Bay, in which 7 offending preschools wereidentified,there is rarely a single school involved in a given area. Currently, we areaware ofclusters of offending schools in the Newbury Park, Whittier, and Riverside areas(see maps).6. It is unrealistic to believe that confronting the school with the child’sallegations ofabuse will produce anything other than denials that such activity is going on.Theschool may submit to “investigation” by the police, which usually involveslittlemore that “talking to” the preschool director. Sometimes the school willthreaten tosue the parents if they file a complaint.Police Investigation of Complaints of Abuse in Preschools1. Police will often discount the allegations of the child if, when theyinterview thechild (s)he does not disclose to them directly. Police often do not understandthatthe child’s life and the family have been threatened if (s)he tells. The policealsotend not to understand that a standard part of Satanic ritual abuse involvesperpetrators dressing in police costumes. Many small children will not talk toevena plainclothes police officer because, in the words of one child, “she is ateacher.”2. Police usually will not interview other children at the preschool becausethey wantto avoid a “panic” or the school losing all its students after parents’suspicions arearoused. The net result is that parents at most schools in which a child hascomplained of abuse are never notified of the allegations, and have noopportunityto seek medical or psychological help for their children.3. Police will normally keep a case open for a few months, warning the familynot tocontact other parents or publicize the case in any way because these actionscould“jeopardize the investigation.” In all cases I have been involved in, no seriousefforts at investigation were ever made. Cases are usually dropped after a fewmonths.- 187 -Appendix 12: Hickey “Play Therapy Notes” - Kinsey Almond“Play Therapy” Record: Kinsey Almond27 January - 10 August 1987Major/Lt.Colonel Deborah L.

Aquino Analysis of Appendix #12Analysis of Hickey “Play Therapy” Record: Kinsey Almond- by -Lt. Colonel Michael A. Aquino26 September 19911.Completeness of the Record.The Hickey record pages are numbered at the bottom. The following numberedpages are missing from the record provided by the CID with the ROI, hence arewrongfully denied to plaintiff in Aquino v Stone under discovery: 1-5, 7-10, 14,17-28, 33, 36, 46, 48-50, 55, 60-62, all after 64.As the CID provided only 32 pages to plaintiff, at least 32 additional pageshave been concealed and suppressed.Since so much importance is placed by the CID on Almond’s credibility as an“accuser”, and in Hickey’s professional ethics and competence, the entire recordis material and essential.Nevertheless it is obviously the CID’s official position that the denied pagescontain nothing of any significance to this case whatever, so the followinganalysistakes the CID at its word in this respect.2.Context of the Record.These interviews did not take place in a single, tight sequence, but rather overaloose, seven-month period. During this period:•The Presidio “day-care child-abuse” theme, in whose November 1986instigation the adult Adams-Thompsons were involved, continued to bepromoted as established truth.•Activist parents maintained close contacts with one another, exchanging allinformation useful in promoting the episode.•The high media profile of the episode, and the involvement of manyinvestigative agencies and personnel, and Washington D.C. interestestablished a commitment to produce one or more guilty parties. An ultimate- 200 -finding that the entire episode was in fact baseless became politicallyunthinkable.•The activist parents proceeded to file [as of 11/27/89] 74 claims against thegovernment for $74,500,000. Clearly they all had a strong financial motiveto promote the episode and see it officially sanctioned as “truth”.3.Deborah Hickey.•Hickey diagnosed “sex abuse” in scores of children, including her own, inconnection with the scam.•Hickey introduced references to the “devil” into her sessions with thechildren (Fox session 5/18/87).•Hickey initiated statues of “gargoyles” in her sessions with the children.•Hickey had no known training in the diagnosis or treatment of “ritual childsex abuse”.•Hickey has no education in or experience concerning the authentic Satanicreligion.•Hickey regularly introduced leading questions into her sessions. Tales of“sex-abuse” did not originate spontaneously from the children, but only inresponse to specific and pointed questions from Hickey.•When Hickey received an “unhelpful” answer from Almond, such as a denialthat Hambright did anything to her, she would refuse to accept it or changethe subject, and would persist in the question until Almond said somethingthat Hickey could characterize as a “helpful” answer, i.e. supportive of a “sex-abuse” diagnosis.•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that on 2/3/87 Almond“stated that she needed to get a gun to kill the bad man”. This is not in theactual Hickey notes of that session.•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that on 2/3/87 Almond“identified this bad man as Mr. Gary”. This is not in the actual Hickey notesof that session. In fact, the notes state that Hickey initiated a question toAlmond “if Mr. Gary was a bad man”, and Almond answered, “No.”- 201 -•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that on 2/3/87 Almond“spontaneously said Mr. Gary had a penis which was soft”. This is not inthe actual Hickey notes of that session. In fact, the notes state that Hickeyinitiated a question to Almond “if his penis was hard or soft”, and Almondanswered, “Hard.”•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that on 2/3/87 Almond“described Mr. Gary as having taken his clothes off on severaloccasions”. This is not in the actual Hickey notes of that session. In fact,the notes state that Hickey initiated a question to Almond “if Mr. Gary evertook his clothes off”, and Almond answered, “Yes.” (no mention of more thanone occasion).•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that on 2/24/87 Almond“named the gluteal region as being ‘buns’”. This is not in the actual Hickeynotes of that session. In fact, the notes state that Hickey initiated aquestion to Almond “if Mr. Gary ever touched her buns”, and Almondanswered, “Yes.”•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that in “other sessionssimilar to the 2/3 and 2/24 ones” Almond “would use a small doll and a largedoll, and place the head of the small doll against the genital area of the largedoll, or describe an action in which the large doll was ‘peeing’ on the smalldoll”. No such actions are described in the actual Hickey notes of thesessions.•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that “Kinsey has alsoexpressed very specific fears of disclosing this information to others becauseof a fear that Mr. Gary would ‘kill her’ with ‘a gun’ and through Mr. Gary’suse of ‘firesticks’ which he would light and put in his mouth. Kinsey … madeit clear to me she was afraid of the ‘firesticks’.” No such actions aredescribedin the actual Hickey notes of the sessions. The subject of “firesticks” wasintroduced to Hickey on 3/30/87 by Almond’s mother Michele Adams-Thompson, not by Almond herself. Hickey initiated a question to Almond ifthe firesticks were “in her bottom”, to which Almond answered, “Yes.”Hickey initiated the subject of a gun to Almond, to which Almondresponded, “Yes.” There was no discussion by Almond of any gun-threat toher, nor any fear of Hambright because of it.•On 23 April 1987, in a sworn affidavit, Hickey said that “During this time,Kinsey has experienced feelings of poor self-esteem, fears and phobias whichinclude fear of going into her own yard to play because of her concern that‘Mr. Gary would be there’, regressive behaviors, including becoming easily- 202 -frustrated, crying over minor events, e.g. tieing her shoes, impairedinterpersonal relationships, isolative behaviors, and a loss of the bright,spontaneous effect which is normally part of her character” No such actionsare described in the actual Hickey notes of the sessions. Almond is describedas playing happily with the toys provided by Hickey throughout all of thesessions, and never crying or being frustrated. She never told Hickey thatshe was afraid that Hambright might be in her yard. Again this was alleged toHickey by her mother, Michele Adams-Thompson.4.“Shambee”.“Shambee” (Hickey’s spelling) appears first on 1/27/87, introduced by Almondas “her friend at school” who was spanked by Mr. Rogers on TV. Almond addedthat Shambee “also had its neck broken”, indicating that “Shambee” is either animaginary “friend” or perhaps a doll.There is no record of the FBI/SFPD/CID interviewing either teachers or otherchildren at the Presidio day-care center to see if anyone used or was known bythename “Shambee”.According to documents introduced by the CID as evidence, there is no mentionof “Shambee” by any other child.On 4/7/87 Almond said Shambee and Sassy were the same person, and thatSassy was Todo’s girlfriend. After this neither Almond nor Hickey used the name“Shambee” anymore, discussing only “Sassy”.“Shambee” is reintroduced as “Mikey’s wife” by Michele Adams-Thompsonon 6/30/87.On 7/7/87 Almond told Hickey that “Nancy and Shambee were good mothers.”On 7/7/87 Hickey asked Almond if Shambee worked at the school. Almond’sanswer - and anything else she may have said as a follow-up on the next threepages of Hickey’s record - has been concealed by the CID by withholding thosepages.5.“Sassy.”There is no record of the FBI/SFPD/CID interviewing either teachers or otherchildren at the Presidio day-care center to see if anyone used or was known bythename “Sassy”.- 203 -According to documents introduced by the CID as evidence, there is nomention of Sassy by any other child. [Almond said that several other childrenhadbeen at Sassy’s house.]Almond said Sassy had blonde hair (4/7/87), then that Sassy had “black hairlike Hickey” (who has brown hair) (4/28/87), then that Sassy had blonde hairagain (5/12/87)Almond said Sassy “had yellow eyes like Hickey” (who has green eyes)(4/28/87).Almond switched Sassy’s name to “Cathy” (5/12/87), then back again to “Sassy”in the same session.There is no record of the FBI/SFPD/CID interviewing either teachers or otherchildren at the Presidio day-care center to see if anyone used or was known bythename “Cathy”.According to documents introduced by the CID as evidence, there is nomention of Cathy by any other child.6.Almond’s Attitude and Credibility.Throughout all of the sessions Almond shows no signs of being an injured orseverely-traumatized child. Left to herself, she plays happily with the toysprovidedby Hickey. All “molestation” themes and questions are initiated by Hickey, andAlmond repeatedly indicates that she doesn’t want to talk about such things andreturns to her playing. From the notes it is quite clear that her reluctance isnotbecause of fear, but rather lack of interest in Hickey’s subject.•On 4/7/87 Hickey asked Almond twice if she ever went anywhere withHambright. Both times Almond said no. When Hickey still persisted,Almond then said yes.•On 4/7/87 said that Sassy & Todo’s house “was upstairs and there were nostairs around”.•Said the car [in which she went to the house] was blue (4/7/87), red &white (4/21/87).•Said Sassy and Todo were white and had blonde hair (4/7/87), then thatSassy had “black hair like Hickey” (who has brown hair) and Todo hadgreen hair (4/28/87).- 204 -•Said Hambright had black hair (4/7/87), then poo-poo-colored hair(4/7/87)•Said Hambright put his penis in her bottom (4/7/87), contradicted bymedical examination 3/12/87.•Answered “yes” when Hickey asked her if there were “firesticks in herbottom” (4/7/87).•Said Sassy and Todo lived [at the house] and then said that they didn’t(4/7/87).•Said Sassy and Todo had “two” toys, then said they had “all kinds of” toys(4/7/87).•Said Sassy and Todo had “dinosaurs that bite and hurt” (4/7/87).•Almond said Sassy “had yellow eyes like Hickey” (who has green eyes)(4/28/87).•On 4/7/87 said that she went to Sassy & Todo’s house. On 5/12/87 said thatthe lady’s name was Cathy and that it was her house (no mention of Todo).•Almond said that she was accompanied to the “house” by Sally, Evan,Brandon Fox, Jaime. None of these persons agreed with her statementsabout the house - and Jaime identified it as a house which was confirmed byJaime’s mother to belong to “Katie”.•On 5/12/87 Almond said that it was Cathy’s house and that Cathy was thename of the woman with Hambright at the house. Then during the samesession, when Hickey asked Almond if “Sassy and Todo” were there,Almond said, “Yes,” and that there were only two adults there withHambright.•On 5/19/87 Almond said she had had nothing to drink at “Mr. Gary’shouse”, then immediately said she had had “a red drink” and “a greendrink”.•On 5/19/87 Almond said there was a baby at “the house” , then said it was“really at home with its parents”. On 8/10/87 she said that the policetook Hambright “to jail with the baby” and that it originally came “fromthe circus”.- 205 -•On 5/19/87 Almond said the baby’s name was “Kay-kay”, then said “thatwasn’t her name and she couldn’t remember”.• On 5/19/87 Almond twice identified a female doll in a red dress toHickey as a “naked man-doll”.•On 5/19/87 Almond identified a toy alligator to Hickey as a dinosaur.Then immediately afterward identified a toy dinosaur to Hickey as analligator.

Unsubstantiated by any of Almond’sbehavior in any of the Hickey sessions.•On 6/2/87 Michele introduced the subject of “Satanic cults” to Hickey. On6/30/87 Michele introduced “Mikey the Army officer/Shambee’s husband”to Hickey.8.“The House” [to which Almond was alleged to have been taken]- 206 -On 4/7/87 Hickey asked Almond twice if she ever went anywhere withHambright. Both times Almond said no. When Hickey still persisted, Almond thensaid yes - to Sassy and Todo’s house.On 4/7/87 Almond said that Sassy & Todo’s house “was upstairs and therewere no stairs around”.On 4/7/87 Hickey asked Almond if the house “had a garage, a tree house, and aswing set, and a fence”, and Almond said, “Yes.” [Our home in San Francisco hasnone of these.]In Hickey’s notes concerning other Presidio children, accounts concerning“trips to a house”, its description, and people connected with it vary markedly.Forexample, in the 5/31/87 Hickey entry concerning Jaime Parker: “[Jaime’s mothersaid] Jaime visited Trinity, and Trinity lives in the general area of Katie andmay beconfusing stories. Then said Katie had approached her and said she used to takekids to her house to go to the bathroom when they would go to Sanchez Park.”There is no record of any FBI/SFPD/CID investigation of “Katie” or searchwarrant ever served on her house to investigate its design, decor, bathtub, etc.9.“The man with Hambright at the house” [to which Almond was alleged to havebeen taken]Almond said he was “Todo” (4/7/87) who had first blond hair (4/27/87) andthen green hair (4/28/87).Almond said the man had brown hair (5/12/87). [My hair is so dark brownthat people generally describe it as black.Almond said the man had “hair all over his face” (5/12/87). [I had no facialhairat all in 1986-87, having a regulation Army haircut with no mustache.]Almond said she had seen the man at the school (5/12/87).Almond said that the house was “Sassy & Todo’s” (4/7/87), then Cathy’s(5/12/87).Almond said that the man was “Dr. Steve” (6/2/87).- 207 -10.“Dr. Steve”.“Dr. Steve” was the only real person specifically and repeatedly (6/2/87)(6/9/87) identified by Almond as being with Hambright at “the house”. She saidthat he was “dressed like a doctor” and that she recognized him because she “sawhis face”.Almond said that he “brought dead people from the hospital” to the house(6/2/87)Almond said that he “spanked Mr. Gary” (6/2/87).On 6/2/87, in answer to Hickey’s question, Almond’s mother Michele Adams-Thompson admitted that she knew who “Dr. Steve” was and that he was a neighborof the Adams-Thompsons at the Presidio of San Francisco.Neither Hickey [as indicated in her notes] nor Michele Adams-Thompsonreported this identification to the FBI/SFPD/CID. There is no record that “Dr.Steve” was ever questioned, served with a search warrant, investigated, ortitled onthe strength of this authentic, unsolicited identification by Almond. There isno explanation of Michele Adams-Thompson’s personal relationship to “Dr.Steve”.11.“Mikey”.“Mikey” was never mentioned initially by Almond, and there is no mention ofthis name whatever until 6/30/87 - after Michele has introduced the idea of a“Satanic cult” to Hickey on 6/2/87.On 6/30/87 it is Michele, not Almond, who introduces “Mikey” to Hickey,alleging that “Mikey is Shambee’s husband”. Michele then alleges to Hickey thatAlmond told her that “Mikey wore an ‘Army suit’ with a stripe on the pants”.Noneof these allegations by Michele were checked by Hickey in her 6/30/87 direct-questioning of Almond, and Almond made no mention of any of them duringthe session.Hickey showed Almond a selection of Army officer rank insignia, from whichAlmond picked out a Chief Warrant Officer 2 insignia, then asked that it bemodified to a Chief Warrant Officer 3 insignia. [Neither insignia looksremotely like a Lieutenant Colonel’s insignia.]Hickey asked what letters were on the nameplate. Almond answered “AK”,which of course is not on my nameplate.- 208 -Almond said (6/30/87) that Mikey “put his penis in her mouth and peed on her,and put poo-poo in her mouth”. During all of the preceding sessions she had madethe same statements concerning (a) Hambright, (b) “little boys”, (c) all of thechildren at “the house”, (d) Sassy, (e) Todo, (f) the cross, (g) the bible, (h)thefemale doll, (i) the penis in the pot hanging from the ceiling with arms andlegs init, and (j) Dr. Steve.The only other mention of the name “Mike” (not “Mikey”) by a Hickey-therapized child was by Jaime Parker. On 7/17/87 Jaime said that “Mr. Mike”spanked kids and her. The CID underlined this entry and put a star beside it inthemargin. On 7/8/87, however, Jaime identified this same individual as “Frank”and said that “he watched the news and didn’t want her mom to make cookies”.The CID did not underline this entry nor put a star beside it in the margin.12.“Todo”.The CID was to make an issue out of the fact that the SFPD found one page fromMrs. Aquino’s telephone notebook containing a list of names and telephonenumbers, one of which was for a “Mike Todo”.As Mrs. Aquino explained to the CID in her May 1989 interview, that page of thenotebook contained a list of persons and their phone numbers who called inanswer to an ad in the San Francisco Chronicle for rental of a flat we own at121Acme Avenue. [The flat was rented to someone else.]We never met this “Todo”, and apparently Mrs. Aquino spoke to him only thatonce on the phone. In the interview she suggested that the CID trace him throughthe phone number he gave - and for that matter verify the nature of the list bycalling the other persons on it.The CID responded that Todo’s phone number was disconnected, butapparently they made no effort whatever to trace him through phone companyrecords, or for that matter to verify the flat-rental-ad nature of the list withany ofthe other names on it.- 209 -Appendix 14: SFPD Search Warrant for Aquino HomeMUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCOSTATE OF CALIFORNIAAFFIDAVIT FOR SEARCH WARRANTThe undersigned, Glenn Pamfiloff, being first duly sworn, deposes and says uponreasonable and probable cause that:1.

Your affiant is an Inspector of the San Francisco Police Department havingbeen apolice officer for 17 years, almost eight of which he had been assigned as aninspector inthe Juvenile Detail of the San Francisco Inspectors Bureau. Affiant hasspecialized inchild molesting cases including child pornography. Affiant further states thathe hastaken classes in child pornography as well as lectured to numerous educators andchildwelfare workers in the field of child pornography. Further affiant has been thetrainingofficer in child pornography for the San Francisco Police Department for thelast threeyears. He has investigated hundreds of cases of child pornography and sexualabuse as- 211 -well as read material on the above subject. He has talked to child molesters,pedophilesand people who deal in filming, selling and buying pictures of and paraphernaliausedin child pornography.Affiant has read research reports, and articles on the subject of childpornographyand child exploitation. I have viewed pictures, movies, video tapes andcommerciallydistributed child pornography depicting juvenile girls and boys posing in asexuallyprovocative manner and engaging in sexual acts with each other and adults.Affiant has corresponded with adults, while working covert investigations, whohaveexplained to affiant in detail how they managed to seduce their juvenile victimsintosexual activity and picture-taking sessions.Affiant has also investigated other child pornography cases in conjunction withtheU.S. Postal Inspectors Office, U.S. Customs and numerous other police agenciesin thefield of child pornography.Based on affiants experience, training and expertise, it is affiant’s opinionthatadults who participate in child molestation and photograph or film incidents ofchildmolestation rarely, if ever, dispose of their sexually explicit material,especially when itis used in the seduction of their victims and the materials are treated asprizedpossessions. These materials have been found in prior investigations to beconcealed insafety deposit boxes, private commercial storage spaces, beneath homes, buried,inautomobiles, hidden inside of legitimate books, etc.2. Child molesters often correspond and/or meet with each other, shareinformationand identify their victims as a means of gaining status, trust, acceptance andpsychological support.3. Child molesters rarely destroy correspondence from other molesters or victimsunless requested to do so. They will conceal this material in the same manner astheirexplicit material.4. Child molesters in most cases, will photograph their victims engaged insexualactivities with the molesters, other adults and other children. These pictures,films,video or other media will always be kept and are treated as prized possessions.5. Child molesters will also use the material, material received from othermolestersand commercially obtained material to illustrate to the victim what activitythey wishthem to engage in.6. Child molesters to risk of discovery, often maintain their own photodevelopingequipment. This includes use of modern state-of-the-art instant developingequipment,such as polaroid, video recorders, etc. They will patronize large volumedeveloping labsthat deal strictly in hardcore adult pornography material to avoid detection.7. Child molesters will often maintain lists of names, addresses, phone numbersofindividuals with whom they have been in contact that share the same interests inchildsex as they do. These names, addresses and phone numbers are sometimes writteninphone books, address books, or on scraps of paper. At times they arecomputerizedonto home computers for easier retrieval.- 212 -8. Child molesters will maintain names, addresses, phone numbers of victims,victim’s friends, or victims of other pedophiles, athletic rosters and schoolrosters inthe same manner as described above.9. Child molesters may use sexual aids that are usually sold in adult bookstoresandarcades, such as dildoes, vibrators, and lotions to stimulate their victimand/or selves.10. Child molesters often maintain diaries of their experience andcommunications"},{"pageContent":"with others. They may take the form of formal diary books, note paper, or anyothertype of writing material.11. Child molesters collect material on all subject matter dealing with childpsychology, family sociology, child physical development and text dealing in theartisticdepictions of youthful figures.12. All the material for seizure will identify children who are being sexuallyexploitedthrough child molestation, child pornography and child prostitution. Thematerials willalso identify other adults who are engaging in the sexual exploitation ofchildren bythese means. In addition, these materials will demonstrate the sexualproclivity,inclination, preference and activities of the person under investigation,providingevidence which will tend to show that the person under investigation hascommittedfelony child molestation (288 P.C.); misdemeanor child molestation (647A P.C.);and/or the producing, distributing, selling, trading, or the exchange of childpornography(311 and its attendant sub-section of the penal code), and contributing to thedelinquency of a minor (272 P.C.).Your affiant states that in his capacity as an Inspector for the San FranciscoPoliceDepartment assigned to the Juvenile Division investigating child molestationcases, hewas notified on August 13, 1987, by Clyde Foreman of the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation of a molestation of a minor child in the City of San Francisco.The minorchild was said to be a 3-1/2 year old minor who was molested at the home ofMichael A.Aquino at 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco, CA on or about September 1, 1986throughOctober 31, 1986.The information given by victim, witnesses and investigators during affiant’sinvestigation is included in San Francisco Police Report No. 870910025 datedAugust14, 1987 and authored by your affiant, Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff. Said reportand itsfull contents is fully incorporated by reference herein as “Exhibit A” as thoughfully setforth.Affiant has verified that suspect Michael A. Aquino currently lives at 123 AcmeAvenue, San Francisco CA by the following information provided by Clyde Formanofthe San Francisco Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigations:1. Investigator Forman visited the residence and confirmed that Michael A.Aquinois listed on the mail box at 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco, CA.2. Investigator Forman stated that he interviewed the U.S. Mail Carrier andMichaelA. Aquino is receiving mail at said address.3. Investigator Forman stated the Pacific Bell informed him that their recordsshowMichael A. Aquino having and occupying the entire upper floor includingapartmentno. 1, no. 2, and a rear unit.- 213 -4. Affiant then confirmed with Pacific Gas and Electric Company that Michael A.Aquino is listed in their records as receiving service at 123 Acme Avenue “topandbase”.5. Affiant checked records of the California Department of Motor Vehicles andMichael A. Aquino’s listed address is 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco, CA.Affiant further states that Investigator Clyde Foreman of the F.B.I. visited theresidence and building at 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco, CA on August 13, 1987.Investigator Foreman found the residence to be located within a gray stucco orplasterthree level fourplex. The address appears in gold letters on the right side ofthe doorframe. There are brick steps leading to a brick porch. The residence is the[numerical]building on the [compass] side of Acme Avenue from the intersection at[Adjacent]Street. The residence has white leveler blinds in all of the windows facing AcmeAvenue.The undersigned further states and declares that he has disclosed and providedtheoffice of the District Attorney and the Court reviewing this affidavit, as partof hisapplication for a search warrant, all known material facts, whether favorable orunfavorable to either side, including all information which may be exculpatory.WHEREFORE affiant prays that a search warrant issue commanding the immediatesearch of the persons and premises above designated for the property and thingsabovedescribed, and that such property be brought before a magistrate or retained asprovided in Section 1536 of the California Penal Code./s/ Glenn PamfiloffAFFIANTSubscribed and sworn to before me this 14th day of August 1987./s/ George ?Judge of the Municipal CourtIn and for the City and County of San Francisco, State of California- 214 -Appendix 15: SFPD “Black Mass” Report by Sandi Daly [Gallant]& Michael Aquino CritiqueSAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT 1NTRA-DEPARTAL MEMORANDUMIntelligence Division Wed., 07/08/81TO:SUBJECT:Captain Daniel MurphySatanic RitualsCommanding OfficerThe Black MassIntelligence DivisionINTRODUCTIONThe witches Mass is a parody of the Christian Mass which is adapted to theworship oftheir own Gods. The black host, bearing the Devil’s symbol, is elevated andfollowerscry out in adoration of him. The witches have preserved the custom of bread andwinefor communion, however, they leave out the confession of sins. Followers form acrossor semi-circle around the altar and prostrate themselves on the ground prior tobeinggiven communion. After this, the Devil coupled with them and a sexual orgy wouldbegin. Black candies, red and/or black altar cloths and red or black gowns areused, aswell as the chapel being hung in red and black. On occasion, a slaughtered childisoffered in sacrifice to the demons.HISTORYCenturies ago, black masses were used frequently to attract love or money, andeven tokill. In one instance, a mass was said over a naked woman and papers were placedunder the altar cloth bearing the names of those it was hoped to either attractto love orkill.One Satanic priest baptized a child in holy oil, strangled him, and offered hiscorpse asa sacrifice to the Devil.On many occasions young virgin females are placed naked on the altar and thepriestwill copulate with her while saying the mass.MODERN MASSESIt is not uncommon, today, for animals to be used and sacrificed in BlackMasses.Usually these will be black cocks, doves or chickens. Their eyes, hearts andtongues are- 215 -ripped out. In some cases, the parts are placed on the altar and consecrated(dependingon the animal used). In other cases, the parts are dried in the sun, ground topowderand preserved for another ritual such as the Mass for the Dead. In this mass,the priest,calls on God to free him from the fear of hell and to make the demons obedientto him.A yellow candle, which has been lit, is extinguished. The throat of a young malelamb isslit and the skin of the lamb is rubbed with the powdered organs of the cock.Priests still follow the Catholic rites closely, but substitute “Satan” for“God” and “evil”for “good.” Christian prayers are reversed and parts of the Mass read backwards.TheSatanist Prayer is used.“Our Father which WERT in heavenThy will be done, in heaven asit is on earthLead us INTO temptationDeliver us NOT from evil ...”The purpose here is to degrade the Christian service and transform it as aritual of themagical force to the glory of Satan.Black Masses are usually kept very secretive because of the types of ritualsrecitedduring them. Satanists believe that when anyone invokes the Devil withintentionalceremonies that “the Devil comes, and is seen.”Respectfully submitted,Sandra C. Daly, Policewoman, Star 1918Approved by:Jerry D. Belfield, Sergeant, Star 1540SFPD-68 (9-70)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Comments Concerning Gallant’s Report:“Satanic Rituals: The Black Mass” (7/8/81)- by -Michael A. AquinoSent to the San Francisco Police Department 8/15/89This report, which was obviously prepared to spotlight and dramatize Gallant’sstatement in her “Temple of Set” report of the previous day (7/7/81) that theTemplewould be performing a Black Mass on Fisherman’s Wharf that month, is an absurdjumble of the most ignorant, horrific, and false myths concerning the MissaSolemnis- 216 -or Black Mass of Satanism. It bears no resemblance whatever to the MissaSolemnis(Black Mass) of the Church of Satan (as retained in the archives of the Templeof Set).The Black Mass of Christian legend was merely a propaganda device used bymedieval Christian institutions in order to terrorize their members againstanythingnon-Christian. [Much the same tactics are being used by present-day Christianfanaticsand extremists to attack other religions generally and the Satanic religion inparticular.] There is no evidence that anything like Gallant’s Black Mass waseverconducted in actuality. It appears only in fictional accounts, most prominentlyJ.K.Huysmans’ novel Là-Bas ( Down There). [Enclosed is an extract from the April1989Scroll of Set newsletter, containing an analysis of Là-Bas by one of our Belgianmembers, introduced by me.]Gallant has no excuse whatever for representing disgusting Christian propagandaasindicative of the Black Mass as practiced by the Church of Satan and retained inthearchives of the Temple of Set. The text of this ceremony is commerciallypublished inAnton LaVey’s The Satanic Rituals (Avon Books #W359, 1972) and thus would havebeen readily available to Gallant had she made any effort at all to obtain it.[Aphotocopy of this section of the Satanic Rituals is enclosed.] What she chose todoinstead was to provide the San Francisco Police Department with deliberate andextremely defamatory misinformation concerning a legitimate religion. In doingso shestrove to create a climate in the SFPD in which other officers (such as GlennPamfiloff)who trusted her “intelligence”, would look for any opportunity to break into ourhomeand seize Temple papers in anticipation of finding verification of all thehorrors Gallanthad been predicting. This is exactly what happened in August 1987 when ChaplainAdams-Thompson’s allegations during the Presidio witchhunt provided Pamfiloff anexcuse to do so [and Gallant an opportunity to accompany him].Concerning the Black Mass of the Church of Satan, as retained in the archives oftheTemple of Set:The authentic Missa Solemnis is a completely legal religious ceremony. Itspurposeis to criticize the god of another religion which has abused the Satanicreligion and itsgod. Thus it occupies exactly the same place in Satanic religious ritual thatthe Rite ofExorcism does in Catholic religious ritual. [For purposes of comparison, a copyof theCatholic Church’s Rite of Exorcism is enclosed.]It should be noted that the Black Mass is a private ceremony for Satanists only.TheChurch of Satan and Temple of Set have never compelled anyone, member or not, toattend or witness the Missa Solemnis. This ceremony would be conducted only forindividuals who request it, and then in private ceremonial facilities.[By contrast, I must add, many unwilling persons have been forced to undergoCatholic exorcisms during the last two thousand years - usually withaccompanyingtorture and eventual execution once the “devils” had been “cast out”. Eventoday, whenChristian churches are prohibited from torturing or killing those who resisttheirindoctrination (= are “possessed”), they usually manage to impose varyingdegrees ofpenance or even physical punishment on those whom they exorcise.]- 217 -The Missa Solemnis contains statements and judgments which would be offensive toa Catholic. Similarly the Rite of Exorcism contains statements and judgmentswhichare extremely offensive to Satanists. If Gallant is going to attack the practiceof onereligion criticizing another, then let her send Captain Murphy intelligencememorandaconcerning Catholic priests in San Francisco who conduct ritual exorcisms aswell.[Gallant, however, has no business passing judgment on the beliefs or ceremoniesofany church as long as no laws are broken.]In his Satanic Rituals, in the section concerning the Black Mass, Anton LaVeywrites:While the Black Mass maintains the degree of blasphemy necessary to make iteffective psychodrama, it does not dwell on inversion purely for the sake ofblasphemy,but elevates the concepts of Satanism to a noble and rational degree. Thisritual is apsychodrama in the truest sense. Its prime purpose is to reduce or negate thestigmaacquired through past indoctrination. It is also a vehicle for retaliationagainst unjustacts perpetrated in the name of Christianity.Further concerning these two points:(1) Reduce past indoctrination: The Setian/Satanic religion has always placedgreat importance on freeing the individual from crippling, self-destructivesuperstitionand indoctrination. By satirizing and lampooning a vehicle of psychologicalcontrol andintimidation used by an individual’s former religion to keep him docile andfearful, wedemonstrate the impotence of that vehicle and free the individual from itsdomination.A Black Mass is tailored to its participants by the officiating Priest. A BlackMassemploying Christian symbolism would not be meaningful for persons with cripplinginhibitions or superstitions stemming from Buddhist or Islamic indoctrination.TheChristian-symbolism Black Mass, however, was naturally most appropriate within aChurch of Satan membership which had generally come from aChristianity-dominatedbackground.(2) Retaliation against unjust acts perpetrated in the name ofChristianity: Christianity has been hurling the most vehement and unjustifiedabuseat Satan and Satanism in its rituals, literature, statements, and actions forthe past twothousand years. [Gallant’s propagandistic “description” of the Black Mass is acase inpoint.] The genuine Black Mass is a reaction and a response to this campaign ofvilification.Although Christian intolerance and persecution of “heretics” date fromantiquity,attacks on nonChristians grew steadily. More times than can be counted thepopulations of conquered “heathen” cultures were given the choice to convert orbe putto the sword. Wars such as the Crusades were regularly funded and fought simplytospread Christianity’s sphere of control, taxation, and exploitation.The Middle Ages and the Renaissance witnessed the uninterrupted slaughter ofaccused witches and Satanists throughout Europe. Not content with just murdering“infidels” and “heretics”, Christians invented history’s most ghastly torturedevices for- 218 -prolonging their death agonies: iron masks that were heated red-hot then spikedtovictims’ faces, iron maidens, racks, boots, screws, and back-breaking wheelsthat arestill preserved in scores of European museums. If unfortunates survived suchtortures,death by burning at the stake was their reward. Accused Satanists tortured andkilled inthe European witch-craze have been estimated by historians as approximately 13million.To this may be added the Thirty Years’ War, the extermination of whole pre-Columbian civilizations, and the Christian pogroms against Jews. Christianity’shistoryis awash in the blood of those who either tried to escape it or who simplywished to livetheir lives free from it. We have good reason to reject it as a terrible plagueofintolerance, misery, and cruelty - in its historical record a stark mockery ofthemessages of peace, brotherhood, and love it insists that it represents.If the more bigoted, vicious, and fanatic elements of contemporary Christianitydidnot go out of their way to try to harm us, there would doubtless be no motivefor theMissa Solemnis to ever be performed. It would become simply a historicalcuriosity.But if the Temple of Set’s religious beliefs are flagrantly distorted andmisrepresentedby Sandi Gallant, and if its private, non-criminal papers are confiscated byGlennPamfiloff on the excuse of a search warrant which has nothing to do with them,and ifChristian clergymen such as Chaplain Adams-Thompson can make the most viciousattacks upon us and be sheltered by society when they do so, then obviously theangerand resentment which inspired Satanists to create the Missa Solemnis are indeedjustified.- 219 -Appendix 16: Sandi Gallant “Satanism and Witchcraft” Definitions[ Gallant entries and definitions in these Italics.Aquino 1986 comments in this regular typeface.]DEFINITIONS - SATANISM AND WITCHCRAFTInformation Furnished by Officer Sandi GallantSan Francisco Police DepartmentIntelligence Division(415) 553-1133ACOLYTESInitiatesA Christian term referring to an assistant at a liturgical mass.

AquinoPost Office Box #4507St. Louis, Missouri 63108September 7, 1987Chief of Police Frank M. JordanSan Francisco Police DepartmentHall of Justice850 Bryant StreetSan Francisco, California 94103Dear Chief Jordan:I believe that my wife, myself, and the church to which we belong (and of whichI amthe chief executive officer) have been treated by SFPD officers in a mannercontrary tothe standards of justice which the Department maintains. I am writing to askyour helpin correcting the matter, in the continuing absence of an answer bySergeant/InspectorGlen Pamfiloff to my letter of August 28 (copy enclosed).The problem is a two-fold one: (1) a recent search of my residence and seizureof myproperty - and property of my church - by Sergeant/Inspector Glen Pamfiloff oftheJuvenile Division, and (2) The “intelligence” activities of an officer namedSandiGallant. The sequence of events is recounted in the enclosed issue of the Scrollof Set,newsletter of my church. A current informational paper concerning this church isalsoenclosed for your information, as is a copy of my personal resumé.Where Sergeant/Inspector Pamfiloff is concerned, it is my feeling that:(1) Pamfiloff failed to adequately research the allegation before obtaining thesearchwarrant. Had he called the Presidio Headquarters to ascertain my whereaboutsduringthe, period the incidents are said to have occurred, he would have learned thatI wasassigned as a full-time student in the National Defense University, Washington,D.C.[as an Army Lt. Colonel on active duty]. It would have been equally easy for himtoverify my wife’s residence there with me, both through NDU and through theWashington apartment building where we leased our apartment.- 227 -(2) Pamfiloff acted solely upon the hearsay statements of the stepfather of a3-1/2year-old child, who was supposedly providing detailed information about asex-abuseincident that happened when she was 2-1/2. This same child’s testimonyconcerningone Gary Hambright was ruled incompetent by a judge, and the child’s stepfatherpromptly gave statements to the San Francisco media expressing his indignationat thejudge’s decision. 159(3) The child, apparently in the company of an FBI agent and her stepfather, wastaken to my house on [a San Francisco] Hill and erroneously identified it as thehomeof Hambright. 160(4) Since neither my wife nor I have ever met this child, and since she hasneverbeen to any of our homes [including the one in San Francisco], I assume that her“identification” of myself and my wife, and her “recognition” of the [SanFrancisco] Hillbuilding, were the result of coaching and prompting by her stepfather. InPamfiloff’sIncident Report it is stated that the stepfather prompted the child severaltimes beforegetting any “identification” from her in the PX.The child is said to have recalled and identified - from age 2-1/2, a yearearlier - thedifference between men’s and women’s clothing, “lion’s feet” on a bathtub, and amoviecamera [as distinct, presumably, from a still camera]. The bathtub wasinconsistentlydescribed as a “bathtub with lion’s feet” and a “plastic lion bathtub”.Such implausible detail and recall from an infant, together with theinconsistency ofher description of the bathtub, should have alerted Pamfiloff to the probabilityofcoaching by her disgruntled stepfather, rather than bona-fide information. Healsoknew, presumably, that a judge had recently ruled this same child incompetent totestify in court.(5) On the basis of this incompetent information and erroneous buildingidentification, Pamfiloff applied for and obtained a search warrant.(6) Upon executing the warrant, Pamfiloff was able to ascertain immediately thatthe child’s supposed “interior descriptions” did not fit my flat. This, togetherwith theinsubstantiality of the accusations made by the stepfather, should havejustified histerminating the search immediately. Nevertheless it continued.159 At the time I wrote this letter, I was still confusing media stories aboutthe Tobins with A-T’saccusations.160 Actually Kinsey A-T had not “identified” our home at all, as the actual CIDreport of that trip wouldverify, but that report was concealed from me until Discovery in Aquino v Stonein 1991. Here I wasresponding to Pamfiloff’s assertion in his Incident Report.- 228 -(7) At the conclusion of the search, Pamfiloff had found nothing whateverrelevantto child-molesting, which is not surprising since neither my wife nor I are orever havebeen child-molesters. Nevertheless he confiscated a number of personal articlesandofficial papers of our church - none of which have anything to do withchild-molesting.As of this date these articles still have not been returned.(8) A police photographer was present during the search, and took pictures bothatrandom and of whatever articles she was directed to by Pamfiloff or otherpersonnelpresent. There is now therefore a complete set of photographs of the interior ofmyhome, and any number of personal effects and papers in it, in the SFPD archives.As mywife and I have never committed any crimes, and as the premises have never beeninvolved in the commission of any crimes, I do not think the SFPD possession ofthesephotographs to be warranted.With regard to the actions of Sergeant/Inspector Pamfiloff, therefore, Irespectfullyrequest the following:(1) That my personal property, and the property of my church, be completelyreturned to me without further delay, and that you instruct the SFPD not toretain in itsfiles any copies of any of this material, whether photographs or papers.(2) That you order that all of the photographs taken of my home and propertyduring the search be destroyed, along with their negatives.(3) That you order the immediate cessation of any efforts by Pamfiloff tocontinuewith this misdirected and unjustified investigation, and that you advise the SanFrancisco office of the FBI and the San Francisco office of the CID of yourdecision.Where Officer Sandi Gallant is concerned, it is my feeling that:(1) She is maintaining “intelligence” files on a legitimately credentialledchurch withno record of any criminal involvement or doctrines.(2) She is presumably maintaining a similar file concerning myself, who alsohave norecord of any criminal involvement.(3) She has openly and without qualification associated the term “Satanic” withchild-molesting, in disregard that there are at least two legitimate, formally-incorporated Satanic churches - the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan -whichhave nothing whatever to do with child-molesting.- 229 -(4) She continues to represent herself to the media and to law-enforcementagenciesas an “expert” on Satanism, and on occultism in general, despite her conspicuousunfamiliarity with these fields.With regard to the actions of Officer Sandi Gallant, therefore, I respectfullyrequestthe following:(1) That you order the immediate destruction of any files she or her office maybemaintaining on the Temple of Set or myself, the maintenance of such files beingaviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution providingfornon-discrimination against religions and equal protection of the law. Furtherthat youforbid her to amass any new “intelligence” on the Temple or myself in theabsence ofany properly documented and warranted Police action.(2) That you order her to cease associating the terms “Satanic” or “Satanism”withcrimes in general, and child-molesting in particular. These are terms particularto abona-fide and officially-recognized religion in the United States which is notin anysense a criminal activity. Its religious terminology should not be associatedwith thecrimes of individuals any more than the term “Christian” is associated with thecrimesof individuals using its symbolisms irresponsibly [for example, Jim Jones].(3) That you order her to cease representing herself as an expert on eitheroccultismin general or Satanism in particular -fields which require years of seriousstudy. [If youwish, the Temple of Set can recommend a curriculum of study for her which willgiveher a solid grounding in this subject matter.] Whether she represents herself asanexpert in child-molesting as a criminal matter is SFPD business, of course.You should also know that I have formally requested the U.S. Army to takedisciplinary action against the captain/chaplain who falsely accused myself andmywife. It is also my intention to file a civil suit against him for hisactions.161I should also add that, to date, I have contacted neither the media nor anycommunity or governmental office above the SFPD concerning this entire affair.Myfamily has lived in San Francisco for the last hundred years, and I have alwaysregardedthe SFPD as a thoroughly reputable, responsible, and distinguished institution.I haveno desire whatever to see it embarrassed before the public eye, or for thatmatter beforeoutside government review systems, because of the actions of two individualofficers. I161 As recounted in this book, I twice filed court-martial charges against LarryA-T, both of which weresuppressed in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. I was unable tofile civil suit againsthim or his wife, because they had been careful to make their accusations only tolaw-enforcementofficials, which provides personal legal immunity.- 230 -am therefore hoping that you can correct this situation through your ownadministrative systems, so that no further concern need be paid to it.In conclusion I would like to reaffirm my personal support, and the support oftheTemple of Set, for the Department’s efforts on behalf of justice. If we can everbe of anyassistance to you or your officers in this regard, please feel welcome tocontact us. 162Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. Aquino162 The SFPD did not answer this letter.- 231 -Appendix 18: Letter, Bernard Zimmermanto SFPD Chief Jordan 9/18/87LAW OFFICES OFPILLSBURY, MADISON & SUTRO225 BUSH STREETPOST OFFICE BOX 7880SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA 94120September 18, 1987Frank N. JordanChief of Police850 Bryant StreetRoom 525San Francisco, CA 94103Dear Chief Jordan:This firm represents Lt. Col. and Mrs. Michael A. Aquino.On August 14, 1987 Inspector Pamfiloff and other officers of your departmentexecuted a search warrant on the Aquino residence. For your convenience Ienclose acopy of the “warrant”, not signed by a judge, that was presented to them duringthesearch. As you can see from the inventory, a substantial number of personalitems wereseized by your officers as well as items belonging to the Temple of Set, achurchorganization of which Lt. Col. Aquino is High Priest.On September 7, 1987 Lt. Col. Aquino sent you a letter of complaint about thesearch, containing a number of requests, including that his property and thepropertyof his church be returned. To date he has received no response to his letter.Shortly after the search I contacted Inspector Pamfiloff, orally and in writing,torequest a copy of the complete search warrant, its supporting affidavit, thepolice reportof the seizure, and the return of the seized property. Enclosed please find acopy of myletter of August 20, 1987. Inspector Pamfiloff’s response was that he would getback tome when he completed processing the seized property.Thereafter Inspector Pamfiloff filed his affidavit and report. I obtained a copyfromthe clerk. After learning of the charges Inspector Pamfiloff was investigating,and- 232 -discussing them with my clients, I called Pamfiloff. I was told he was ondisability leaveand that the case had been reassigned to Sgt. Eisenman.I called Eisenman and advised him that my clients could not possibly havecommitted the acts in question. I told him that they had lived continuously fromJuneof 1986 through August of 1987 in Washington, D.C., where Lt. Col. Aquino hadbeenordered to attend the National Defense University, and that during the period inquestion Lt. Col. Aquino was attending classes daily except for certain periodswhichwe could document and which were generally related to his receiving medicaltreatment.I offered to meet with Sgt. Eisenman to provide him with as much detail as Icouldso he could confirm my clients’ story. Sgt. Eisenman’s response was that thePoliceDepartment could do its own investigating.I called back a few days later only to be told that the investigation wascontinuing. Ioffered to identify military personnel in Washington, D.C. who could confirm myclients’ whereabouts, but Sgt. Eisenman replied that my help was not needed. Ihavesubsequently called Sgt. Eisenman on several occasions and he has not returnedthosecalls.As of this date, my clients stand falsely accused of a very serious charge, andyourdepartment seems to be making no effort to contact the appropriate militarypersonnelin Washington, D.C. to develop the information which will clear them. Nor hasyourdepartment returned any of the seized property.On behalf of the Aquinos I hereby request that you forthwith conduct an internalinvestigation into this matter with two ends in mind:One is to clear the Aquinos and return their property to them. We stand ready tocooperate with your department in this regard.Another is to determine whether your officers acted properly in obtaining andexecuting the warrant, in failing to return the seized property timely, and infailing totimely conduct the necessary investigation to clear my clients. Again we standready tocooperate with your investigating officers and to disclose full particulars ofthe mannerin which we believe your officers acted irresponsibly, some of which are setforth in Lt.Col. Aquino’s letter to you.I frankly do not understand why your officers would prefer to believe theunsubstantiated statement of a three-year-old girl over the statement of a Lt.Colonel inthe United States Army and the other military personnel who stand ready tosupporthim. I hope it is not because your officers are prejudiced against the Aquinosbecause of- 233 -their religious affiliation. I am sure you are as interested as the Aquinos arein gettingthis matter resolved, and trust you will give this letter your prompt attention.163Yours very truly,/s/ Bernard Zimmerman163 The SFPD did not answer this letter.- 234 -Appendix 19: Letter, M. Aquino to SFPD Chief Jordan 10/18/87Lt.Col. Michael A. AquinoPost Office Box #4507St. Louis, Missouri 63108October 18, 1987Chief of Police Frank M. JordanSan Francisco Police DepartmentHall of Justice850 Bryant StreetSan Francisco, California 94103Dear Chief Jordan:To date I have received no answer to my letter to you of September 7, 1987concerning your review of the actions of Sergeant/Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff andOfficer Sandi Gallant. My attorney, Mr. Bernard Zimmerman of Pillsbury, Madison&Sutro, has been left with the impression that the SFPD is uninterested in anyeffort tosettle the situation cooperatively and constructively through administrativeprocedures, and that the only course open to me is thus formal litigation.This is very disappointing to me because, as I indicated in my 9/7 letter, Ihave neverin my life regarded the SFPD as an adversary. I will of course do what I amforced to doto preserve my rights and reputation as a citizen, but I deplore having to do sobecauseof a situation which my common sense tells me is completely unnecessary.If you are in fact conducting your own administrative review of the actions ofPamfiloff and Gallant, I would very much appreciate word from your office tothateffect. If I am informed that you have indeed begun such an internalinvestigation, Iwould want to wait until you had a reasonable time to complete it before actingon myattorney’s advice.Further concerning the activities of Sandi Gallant:Officer Gallant is currently distributing to law-enforcement agencies andprivatechild-abuse action organizations the enclosed papers, which freely andrepeatedlyattribute various illegal practices to “Satanism”. The very fact that thesepapers arebeing distributed in the name of the San Francisco Police Department has theeffect ofconveying the Department’s endorsement of them, and of implying that “Satanism”is- 235 -in fact a criminal activity rather than the code of beliefs of a legitimate andlaw-abidingreligion.With my 9/7 letter to you I enclosed a statement of the Temple of Set’s actualethicsand thoroughly-legitimate standards, so there should be no question as to whatwebelieve and practice. We stand ready at any time, as we always have, to discussourphilosophy with any representative of yours.Sandi Gallant’s papers, in addition to seriously misleading law-enforcement andprivate agencies concerning legitimate Satanism, also contain a great manyerrors offact which I have addressed in my attached critique. I have assembled thiscritique notonly to demonstrate Gallant’s incompetence as an advertised “expert” onSatanism, butalso because the SFPD’s continued endorsement and dissemination of these papersmay very well mislead other law-enforcement civic agencies concerning the topicsaddressed, with the ultimate effect of possibly confusing crime investigationsandultimately embarrassing you both in official channels and in the media as theauthorityunder whose license Gallant is advertising herself.As I mentioned in my 9/7 letter, the Temple of Set has more information onoccultism in general, and on Satanism in particular, than any other institutioninexistence. We have regularly been consulted by academics, the press, and otherlaw-enforcement agencies accordingly, and have invariably done our best to assistthem.You may wish to contact Detective Metoyer of the Los Angeles Police Department(213)485-2962 and Detective Smith of the L.A.P.D. Gang Division (213) 485-2501 fortwoverifications of this.It accordingly strikes us as more than a little absurd that the PoliceDepartment inour own city should not only not avail itself of our assistance in researchwhich itconsiders important, but instead approaches us like the Ghostbusters assaultingahaunted house. I would like to think that Sandi Gallant’s enthusiasm for herpersonalmedia image does not overrule your own concern and responsibility for the entireDepartment’s professional precision and reputation.If you had been provided with accurate information concerning the Temple of Setand the Satanic religion, I am certain you would understand my indignation atthePamfiloff/Gallant raid on my San Francisco home this past August. In fact, ifyou hadbeen provided with accurate information, I doubt that such an event would haveoccurred in the first place. It is for this reason that I am more concerned withthequality of the “intelligence” being fed your officers by Gallant than I am withthespecific actions of Pamfiloff, who - as a consequence of believing such“intelligence” -may have honestly assumed that he was setting out that evening to confront allmannerof nameless horrors and brain-curdling blasphemies at my San Francisco home.- 236 -Gallant has never voluntarily provided copies of her “intelligence” paperseither tome or to the press, claiming repeatedly that they are “official policebusiness”. It isquite obvious now that they are nothing of the sort - that they contain noinformationsensitive to any police procedure or investigation. It is more conspicuously thecasethat she did not want them seen by persons such as myself who know enough aboutthesubject material to expose them for their thoroughly inadequate andunprofessionalsubstance.Accompanying Gallant’s “intelligence papers” is the enclosed “Ritualistic CrimeProfile and Questionnaire”. Based as it is on her “intelligence papers”, I seeno need tocritique it for you, as I trust the point concerning its thorough inadequacy ismade. Ialso note on the Questionnaire that Captain Daniel Murphy has requested that it“notbe duplicated or distributed without prior written consent of the IntelligenceDepartment of the SFPD”. While the Temple of Set will honor this request, childabuse action groups are not doing so, with the result that yet one more set ofmisleading papers from Gallant attributed to your Department is in uncontrolledcirculation.I would appreciate some indication from you as to the disposition the mattersmentioned in my 9/7 letter. As stated in that letter and reemphasized in thisone, I verymuch wish to resolve these matters cooperatively and constructively, rather thanadversarily.164Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. Aquino164 The SFPD did not answer this letter.- 237 -Appendix 20: Motion to Restore Property,San Francisco Municipal CourtPILLSBURY, MADISON & SUTROBERNARD ZIMMERMANSHAWN HANSON225 Bush StreetPost Office Box 7880San Francisco, CA 94120Telephone: (415) 983-1179Attorneys for Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Michael AquinoDated: October 28, 1987.Municipal Court of the City and County of San Francisco. State of CaliforniaIn re: 36 video tapes, etc. seized from LIEUTENANT COLONEL and MRS. MICHAELAQUINOMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIESIN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO RESTORE PROPERTYOn August 14, 1987 the San Francisco Police Department executed a search warranton the home of Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Michael Aquino. The Aquinos weregivenan unsigned copy of the warrant, a true and correct copy of which is attached tothedeclaration of Bernard Zimmerman as Exhibit A. The police seized a substantialamount of property. A copy of the inventory as given to the Aquinos is attachedto theZimmerman declaration as Exhibit B. It does not list all the seized property(Zimmerman Decl.).Almost three months have now passed. The Aquinos have not been charged with anycrime. The Police Department has refused to return their property despiterepeatedoral and written requests. 165 True and correct copies of the written requestsareattached to the Zimmerman declaration as Exhibits C, D, E. The Police Departmenthas165 Since this motion was first prepared, the Police Department first offered toreturn the property,then changed their mind and then offered to return some of it. The Aquinos haveno idea what thePolice Department’s actual position is except that no property has yet beenrestored to them(Zimmerman Decl.).- 238 -provided no explanation for its continued retention of the property. Instead ithastaken the position that its policy is to require the owner to retain an attorneyand go tocourt to obtain an order for the return of property. The Police Department willnot seeksuch an order. Accordingly the Aquinos have now moved this Court for an orderrestoring all the seized property to them.ARGUMENTPenal Code section 1540 provides as follows:If it appears that the property taken is not the same as that described in thewarrant, or that there is no probable cause for believing the existence of thegrounds on which the warrant was issued, the magistrate must cause it to berestored to the person from whom it was taken. Leg. H. 1872 (Pen. Code § 1540)In addition this Court, as the repository of the seized property, has the powertorelease improperly seized or retained property under both Penal Code section1536 and“the inherent power of the court to control and prevent the abuse of itsprocess” ( Bukerv. Superior Court (1972) 25 Cal. App. 3d 1085).In this case, there is no reason why the property should not be returned andmanyreasons why it should.First, a review of the incomplete inventory discloses that the property seizedis notthe same as the property described in the warrant. For example, nothing in thewarrantdescribes a computer or any of the 36 videotapes which, as the evidence to beproducedin the courtroom will show, are mostly commercially released videotapes ofmoviessuch as Star Trek. Even as to those items of seized property, such as“miscellaneousloose papers with names and addresses”, which have some superficial relation toproperty described in the warrant, the evidence at the hearing will clearlyestablish thatthe papers seized do not contain names or addresses which would tend to“identify anyjuvenile”. 166The seized property does include membership lists and similar records of areligiousorganization, the Temple of Set, of which Lt. Col. Aquino is High Priest. Assuch theproperty should be restored since its seizure and continued retention violatesthefreedoms of religion, privacy, and association guaranteed by the United StatesandCalifornia Constitutions. For example, in NAACP v. Alabama (1958) 357 U.S. 449,theSupreme Court struck as unconstitutional an order requiring the NAACP to produceitsmembership lists.166 Similar constitutional considerations require a prompt determination ofwhether the property wasproperly seized. (See Roday v. Superior Court (1961) 55 Cal. 789, 799).- 239 -Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances beindispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where agroup espouses dissidents beliefs. (id.)Nor is. there any probable cause for believing the existence of the grounds onwhichthe warrant was issued. The Police Department knew or should have known that theinformation upon which the affidavit in support of the warrant was based wasinaccurate.Assuming, however, for purposes of this motion that the warrant was properlyissued, there is certainly no longer any probable cause to connect the Aquinoswith anyof the alleged crimes in connection with which the property was seized. Theinvestigation into those crimes has been conducted by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation and the United States District Attorney’s Office. As the PoliceDepartmentwell knows, the Honorable Joseph Russoniello, United States Attorney, recentlyannounced that after an extensive investigation of those alleged crimes, afederal grandjury returned an indictment against one Gary Hambright and that no furtherarrestswould be made because there was no evidence of any co-perpetrator (ZimmermanDecl.).Moreover, the Aquinos were living in Washington, D.C. during the period when thealleged crimes were committed, where Lieutenant Colonel Aquino was regularlyattending the National Defense University while on assignment by the UnitedStatesArmy (Zimmerman Decl.).Instead, it appears that the only reason the Police Department has not returnedtheAquinos’ property is because of a policy or practice it has of requiring theowner of theproperty to retain counsel and affirmatively move this Court for a return ofproperty.Such a policy or practice constitutes a deprivation of the rights to be freefromunconstitutional searches and seizures, and to not be deprived of propertywithout dueprocess of law guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the UnitedStates Constitution and by Article 1 of the California Constitution.[Section 1540] does not put the burden on the citizen of suing to get theproperty back. It makes it the duty of the magistrate to see to its restorationby amandatory “must”. There is no discretion about it. Upon ascertaining that theproperty taken is not that described in the warrant - and it is not difficult todothat - he must not order its return, but must “cause it to be restored”.Further,the statute says nothing about ownership; it deals only with possession. ( Sternv.Superior Court (1946) 76 Cal. App. 2d 772, 784) [emphasis in original.]- 240 -These rights belong not only to the Aquinos but to all other citizens who aresubjectto the policy and practice of the San Francisco Police Department. This practiceis anabuse of this Court’s process, and this Court should order an end to it. 167For the foregoing reasons and for any additional reasons which may be adduced atthe hearing, Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Michael Aquino respectfully requestthisCourt to order that all property seized from them be restored forthwith, that anorderissue directing the San Francisco Police Department to henceforth move the Courtforan order permitting it to return property when it concludes that it has noreasonablebasis for continuing to retain it and for an award of attorneys’ fees incurredinobtaining said order.167 Under Section 10255 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Aquinos are entitledto their attorneys’ feesfor vindicating this important public right.- 241 -JEFF BROWNPublic DefenderPETER G. KEANEChief AttorneyGrace Lidia SuarezDeputy Public Defender555 Seventh StreetSan Francisco, California 94103(415) 553-1671Attorneys for Amicus CuriæDate: Nov. 24, 1987Time: 9:00 a.m.Dept.: 18IN THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIAIN AND FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCOIn re: 36 video tapes, etc. seized from LIEUTENANT COLONEL and MRS. MICHAELAQUINOAPPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAR AS AMICUS CURIÆTO THE HONORABLE PHILIP MOSCONE, JUDGE OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT:The San Francisco Public Defender hereby applies for leave to appear as amicuscuriæ in support of petitioners.The Public Defender of the City and County of San Francisco represents the vastmajority of indigents arrested by the police in this county and from whomproperty isseized.As is shown in the attached declarations, the repeated refusal of the SanFranciscoPolice Department to return property seized from arrestees or suspectsconstitutes anongoing deprivation of the constitutional rights of these clients of the PublicDefender,and a substantial expenditure of City funds budgeted for the use of the PublicDefender’s Office. The Public Defender has a deep and abiding interest in a fairresolution of this problem.WHEREFORE, the San Francisco Public Defender respectfully requests leave toappear as amicus curiæ and to file a brief in support of petitioners.Respectfully submitted,JEFF BROWNPublic Defender- 242 -By:Grace Lidia SuarezDeputy Public DefenderAttorneys for Amicus CuriæBRIEF AMICUS CURIÆINTRODUCTIONAmicus believes that the actions of the San Francisco Police Department in thepresent case do not present an isolated instance of police misconduct, butrather apolicy of the police, which encourages its officers to refuse to returnproperty, whetherseized with or without warrant, even when the property is neither contraband norevidence in any pending case.Support for the Public Defender’s belief is found in his own, his deputies’ andemployees’ experiences. The declarations of some of them are attached to thisbrief.This policy or practice results in harm to hundreds of indigent suspects andarrestees, who are deprived of property sometimes necessary for survival. Italso resultsin the waste of thousands of taxpayers’ dollars in salaries paid to the deputypublicdefenders and office employees who must aid these people in obtaining theirproperty,as well as the waste of judicial resources consumed in pointless hearings onmotions forreturn of property.Amicus hopes that this Court, through a strongly-worded Order commanding thereturn of Lt. Colonel Aquino’s property, will send a clear message to the SanFranciscoPolice Department that the courts will not abide the illegal retention of theproperty ofcitizens.BY RETAINING PROPERTY WHICH IS NEITHER CONTRABAND NOR EVIDENCEIN A PENDING CASE, THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ITSOFFICERS VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE AFFECTEDCITIZENSThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no personshall “be deprived of ... property, without due process of law; nor shallprivate propertybe taken for public use without just compensation”.The Fourth Amendment protects citizens “against unreasonable ... seizures”. TheCalifornia Constitution, Articles 13 and 19, provides similar protections.- 243 -The California Supreme Court has stated in no uncertain terms its opinion that agovernment agency violates the law when it refuses to return property one of itsagentshas seized. In Minsky v City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal. 3d 113 it stated:Governmental officers who seize an arrestee’s property bear the duty to provideareceipt, to safeguard, and to pay and deliver such property as the prisonerdirects except“when otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction” (Government Codesection 26640) ( Minsky, supra at 119; emphasis added)168The Court added,... we find that the government in effect occupies the position of a bailee whenit seizesfrom an arrestee property that is not shown to be contraband ( cit. om. ). Thearresteeretains his right to eventual specific recovery, whether he seeks to regaintangibleproperty ... or ... money ... ( Minsky, supra at 121)The Court reaffirmed its holding in Minsky in 1978 ( Holt v Kelly (1978) 20 Cal.3d560, reiterating that “respondent [the Trinity County sheriff] [was] under aduty toreturn the claimed property to petitioner”. ( Holt supra at 564)Government Code section 26640 details the duties of government agents who seizeproperty from arrestees:The sheriff169 shall take charge of, safely keep, and keep a correct account of,allmoney and valuables found on each prisoner when delivered at the county jail.Exceptwhen otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the sheriff shallpay suchmoney or sums therefrom or deliver such valuables as the prisoner directs andshall payand deliver all the remainder ... to the prisoner upon his release from the jail(emphasisadded).In Handschuh v Superior Court (1985) 166 Cal. App.3d 41, 212 CR 296, the CourtofAppeal held that person whose property had been taken under color of a searchwarrant and subsequently lost or destroyed could maintain an action under Title42,United States Code section 1983170 , which holds that168 It should be noted that although Government Code section 26640 refers to“the sheriff”, theMinsky court found “no valid distinction between the duty of a county sheriffand the duty of citypolice officers with respect to an arrestee’s property” (at 119, fn. 5).169 and the police (see footnote 1 supra).170 In the State court.- 244 -Every person who, under color of any statute of any State ... subjects, orcausesto be subjected, any citizen of the United States to the deprivation of anyrights,privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liabletothe party injured in an action at law ... or other proper proceeding forredress.( Handschuh supra at 43)This action could be brought even though the aggrieved party has a civil remedyforconversion of the property, since it constituted a violation of “the substantiveguarantees of the Constitution” (quoting Al-Mustaf a Irshad v Spann (ED Va.1982)543 F. Supp. 922, 926). 171There is no authority for the police or any other governmental agency to retainpossession of property which is not contraband, stolen property, or evidence(seePeople v Superior Court (McGraw (1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 154, 160; Penal CodeSection1411 (stolen property); Buker v Superior Court (1972) 25 Cal. App.3d 1085(money)).The entire statutory scheme (Penal Code Sections 1407-1422) envisions the returnof allproperty to its owner or possessor with the exception of dangerous or deadlyweapons,narcotic or poison drugs, explosives, or items prohibited by law (Section 1419).CONCLUSIONThe actions of the San Francisco Police Department in the present case seemtotallyunwarranted. Furthermore they appear to be part of the larger pattern of illegalbehavior observed by amicus. This Court should grant petitioners’ motion forreturn ofproperty and warn the Police Department that, by retaining property withoutjustification, it is violating the constitution, state law, and judicialdecisions.171 It is ironic to note that the defendants in Handschuh were also SanFrancisco police officers. Thispractice seems to have been going on for some time.- 245 -Appendix 21: Letter, Michael Aquino toSFPD Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff 12/10/87Lt.Col. Michael A. AquinoPost Office Box #4507St. Louis, Missouri 63108December 10, 1987Sergeant/Inspector Glenn PamfiloffJuvenile Division, San Francisco Police Department2475 Greenwich StreetSan Francisco, California 94123Dear Inspector Pamfiloff:I have recently seen television footage of you testifying on the stand at thehearingconcerning the return my property and that of the Temple of Set. When Mr.Zimmerman asked you if there were other matters under investigation concerningme,you answered: “Child stealing and various subsections, child abuse, childneglect, childmolests, rapes.” You have also been quoted to me as expressing a desire to“nail” me forchild molestation, and expressing your conviction that I and a close circle ofintimatesare perverts and homosexuals and chronic abusers of children.I continue to be as perplexed by all of this as I was when you made yoursurprisevisit to my home last August. Either you are a reputable officer who has beengrosslymisinformed, or you are an unprincipled one embarked on a personal crusade inwhichthe truth is an unimportant annoyance to you. As when I wrote you my earlierletterconcerning Adams-Thompson’s false allegations, I would prefer to believe thatyou setstore by your professional integrity and would not use your office to abusepersons forreasons that have nothing to do with lawbreaking.The purpose of this letter is to set certain facts before you, and to invite youto writeme personally concerning these or other issues of concern to you. If I cansupport myresponses with documentation, I will be pleased to do that as well. As I havecontinually stressed to Chief Jordan and yourself, it is very exasperating forme to beforced to take legal action against the Police Department for a situation asabsurd asthis. While I will of course do what is necessary to clear my name and that ofmychurch, I would much prefer that the situation be resolved in cooperation withthePolice rather than at their expense.- 246 -1. Concerning my personal morality:As you know, I am a professional Army officer. I have eighteen years’ worth ofannual officer efficiency reports written by superiors in daily contact with me,withwhom I have socialized on off-duty time as well as on-duty. All have been awareof myreligion. Copies of the last several years’ OERs are enclosed. You will noticethat eachOER requires a rating for the subject’s moral qualities, and that I haveconsistentlyreceived not only the highest rating, but in several cases additional commentsincommendation of same.You are also aware that, periodically throughout my military career, I have beenroutinely investigated by the Defense Investigative Service for securityclearances upthrough Top Secret/Special Compartmented Information/Special IntelligenceAccess.Such Special Background Investigations (SBIs) are exceedingly thorough and gobackthrough the previous 15 years of the subject’s life. If I were a degenerate, acriminal, apervert, or a homosexual, I am quite sure that it would have come out in atleast one ofthese several investigations - which focus as much upon the subject’s private,personallife as upon his professional one. The results of all of these investigationshave beenentirely clean of anything reprehensible, as I’m sure you have verified throughthe DIS.Enclosed is a copy of my current personal resumé. I am providing it so that youcansee the sorts of interests I have held throughout my life, and the professionalpaths Ihave followed. Many of these activities have resulted in distinctive awards andspecialrecognitions to me, which necessarily reflect my character as an individual inadditionto the specific work in question. I have received many high offices and honorsin theBoy Scouts of America - an environment in which the slightest deviant behaviorwouldnot be ignored or excused.In these three examples please note that I have focused upon evaluations of memade not by myself, but by other people in regular contact with me over extendedperiods of time, who are not members of the Temple of Set.Also enclosed are photocopies of a chapter I wrote in my National DefenseUniversity thesis this past year in Washington on the subject of ethics. Whileyou’re atit, why don’t you drop by the Political Science Department of Golden GateUniversityand take a look at the lesson plans I wrote for my courses in politicalphilosophy, whichemphasize the development of Western civilization’s moral and ethicaltraditions? [Thecourse outlines to ask for are those which I prepared for Humanities #143-C:Dynamicsof Western Culture.]2. Concerning the interests and activities of the Temple of Set:Again I would like to begin my comments by referring to documentation.- 247 -Among the materials you confiscated from my home was my complete file of thepast year’s issues of Hieroglyphs, my newsletter as High Priest of the Temple ofSet tothe entire Priesthood of Set - the officials of the entire institution. As youread throughthem, I am sure that you saw that they had nothing even remotely do do withpedophilia or any other degenerate activity. Where they talked about integrity,in fact,they emphasized the high standards of integrity upon which the Temple of Set hasalways insisted. These issues of Hieroglyphs would dispel, I. think, any notionthatpedophiliac activities are being carried on within the “secret inner circle” oftheTemple. That “inner circle” - the Priesthood of Set - is concerned withmaintaining theTemple’s high ethical standards, not with abusing them.In those same issues of Hieroglyphs you also saw a report on the past threeyears’financial transactions of the Temple, itemized by category. You saw that thereare notthe kinds or sizes of sums or transactions that would presumably appear if theTemplewere trafficking in child pornography or anything else illegal. [Where mypersonalfinances are concerned, you know that I am well off as a consequence ofcommercialreal estate holdings, hence have no motive at all to supplement my income bymeans ofpornography.]In case you don’t have a reasonably current copy of the Crystal Tablet of Set,ourprincipal membership “guidebook”, I am sending you one under separate cover. Thepoint in doing this is simply to illustrate the immense time and effort theTemple of Set-and I myself - have devoted to developing its religious philosophy, and for youto seefor yourself that this philosophy couldn’t possibly be less concerned withsexualperversions concerning children. The sheer mass and complexity of thisphilosophy arethe product not of some hastily-contrived “cover story”, but of years and yearsofexhaustive research, dialogue, and writing by many dedicated people.You have now seen both the “inner” and “outer” communications of the Temple ofSet to its membership. You have seen our repeated and strong statements insupport oflegality in general, and in opposition to sexual or any other kind of abuse ofchildren,animals, etc. - statements of policy that go back to our founding in 1975. Whatelse canyou possibly expect a church do to make its policies clear in this regard?3. Concerning the allegations of Sandi Gallant concerning “Satanic childabuse”:I assume that Gallant is responsible for the image in your mind of Satanists asfiendishly clever maniacs who not only rape, sodomize, and murder children butalsobreed them so that they can rape, sodomize, and murder them that much faster. InGallant’s mind the absence of any evidence of such a nationwide assembly-line ofrape,sodomy, and murder certainly doesn’t mean it isn’t happening; it just means thatweSatanists are even more fiendishly clever than people suspect!- 248 -I am reminded of a test for witchcraft used in. the middle ages. The accused wasbound hand and foot and thrown into a river. If she floated, she was guilty (the“watersof God had rejected her”) - and was taken out to be burned at the stake. If shesank andstayed down, she was innocent - but of course she also drowned. Is this the kindof“test” we are now being subjected to - one in which it is unacceptable for us tobeinnocent, even though we are?Gallant has a cozy situation going for her. She has been able to makeallegations tofellow officers behind closed doors for years, but has never once made theseallegations, and submitted her evidence for them, before any individual such asmyselfwho has the knowledge and background to correct her. When I once asked her to doso,some years ago in the privacy of her own office, she refused with her classicresponse:“Official police business.” That kept her ignorance from being exposed, ofcourse, butthe long-term result is that other officers like you are now paying the pricefor it.I’m sure that you have seen my detailed critique to Chief Jordan of the set ofGallant’s “intelligence” papers which the California Consortium of Child Abusecurrently provides to inquirers. Since then my attorneys have also obtainedextensiveadditional information concerning her allegations and statements, all admissibleforcourt purposes. In the face of this evidence, how can you continue to let thiswomanmanipulate you? By relying and acting on her wild fantasies, you and theDepartmentare now in a publicly embarrassing situation that can only get worse as themediacontinue to bring the facts out.I have made no secret to Chief Jordan of my opinion of Gallant as a “Satanicexpert”.I think that she is thoroughly incompetent and dangerously unprofessional as apoliceofficer, since her fantasies and misinformation lead directly to the harassmentandpersecution of innocent people by other officers who have trusted her“intelligence”.4. Concerning Gallant’s sources of information prejudicial to me or theTemple:There are two of these whose names have been regularly brought up to me: LewisDale Seago and Linda Osborne Blood. Both are ex-members of the Temple of Set whowere expelled for violation of our ethical standards. Both carry a grudgebecause of this.Dale Seago was a high-level initiate of the Temple who was expelled for makingslanderous statements concerning me and for several other acts of unethicalbehaviorin his capacity as a senior Temple officer. He was manipulated into suchbehavior byhis wife Amber, whom he loved very deeply, and who unfortunately happened to behaving an affair behind his back [about which I had the thankless task oftelling him].When Amber was exposed, she left the Temple and made it her goal to get herhusbandthrown out as well. Shortly after she succeeded in this, she abandoned him.Shamed- 249 -and humiliated before all of the friends and associates with whom he had workedforover a decade, he is now scarcely an objective source of information. Additionaldistasteful details are unnecessary here, but would certainly come out if itwerenecessary to impeach his testimony in court.Linda Blood joined the Temple of Set enthusiastically in 1979 and participatedactively in it. Unfortunately she also developed a sexual crush on me, which Irefused toreciprocate. Her sexual fixation became so conspicuous and obnoxious that shewasultimately expelled from the Temple [by Seago, in fact, with whom she had had anaffair]. She then went on a continuous campaign of leaving venomous and sexuallyobscene messages on the telephone answering machines of my old, terminally-illmother, my wife, and myself. After a year of waiting for these to abate, Icomplained tothe Lexington, Massachusetts Police Department and they took action which haltedherfor a time. Then she moved to another city and the calls began again, persistingto thisday. Since these calls regularly contained many screaming and shriekingaccusationsthat I was a homosexual, a sado-masochist, and almost every imaginable kind ofsex-pervert, I can only suppose that Blood is the source of your above-quotedallegations.Needless to say, it would be quite easy to establish her prejudice, bias, andsexual-obsessive motives. [We have all of her answering-machine messages on tape, acopy ofwhich accompanied my letter to the Lexington Police.] As for her experiences intheTemple of Set, we have scores of letters from her saying how much she enjoyedit, itsactivities, and the friends she made therein. I daresay that her frustratedsexualpassions hardly justify her subsequent bitter and caustic attacks on the Templeormyself.5. Other disaffected ex-members of the Temple of Set:You can keep searching for these, of course, and I’m sure you will find at leastsome.But you would be wise to ascertain why such individuals were expelled from theTemple before you rely upon their accounts. As you have seen from ourliterature, wedo not allow people with disruptive, destructive, or degenerate interests orbehavior toenter the Temple - or to remain in it if their true colors are only discoveredlater on. Ifyou wish to identify any such sources of information to me, I will be happy totell youexactly why they were expelled from the Temple - or why they left in annoyancewhenthe Temple did not support their particular interests. If you don’t know this,it wouldjust be embarrassing for the Department when it eventually does come out.* * *If, after considering this letter, you see fit to work towards a dignified andcooperative close to this affair that will reflect well upon the SFPD and enabletheTemple of Set to continue its legitimate and decent existence as a church in theSan- 250 -Francisco community without further unjustified confrontations, I will do mypart tohelp.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. Aquino- 251 -Appendix 22: Letter, Michael Aquino toSFPD Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff 3/7/88Lt.Col. Michael A. AquinoPost Office Box #4507St. Louis, Missouri 63108March 7, 1988Sergeant/Inspector Glenn PamfiloffJuvenile Division, San Francisco Police Department2475 Greenwich StreetSan Francisco, CA 94123Dear Inspector Pamfiloff:My attorney Mr. Shawn Hanson has advised me that you have now begunquestioning children from the Presidio day-care center in an effort to elicit“identifications” of me in your investigation of the Presidio scandal.From the information which I have voluntarily provided to you over the pastseveralmonths, including the sworn statements of my wife and myself and supportingdocumentation in the court-martial charges which I have preferred againstChaplainAdams-Thompson, it should be abundantly clear to you that we never had anythingtodo with the Adams-Thompson child, much less the Presidio day-care center. Webothhave an established lifetime history of never having abused any children at anytimefor any reason. And as you know from my resumé, I have not had just an averagelifebut one consistently marked by the highest moral and professional evaluationsandrecognitions.From your confiscation of my wife’s and my personal property during yoursurprisesearch of our home, you further know that neither of us had any pedophiliacmaterialswhatever. And from both your confiscation of executive papers and your review ofthegeneral membership materials of the Temple of Set, you know that there isnothingwhatever in its doctrines or practices that either tolerates or advocates theabuse ofchildren, ritually or otherwise. [Indeed, from the papers I provided you, youare awarethat hundreds of priests and ministers from conventional churches have beeninvolved in pedophilia. Since the Temple of Set is conspicuous for having noinvolvement whatever with any crime, including this one, since its founding 13yearsago, why should it be singled out for persecution in this instance?]- 252 -Accordingly I fail to see any reason why you should be deliberately trying toproduce“identifications” of my wife or myself from other Presidio day-care children.There is noreason to single us out for special mention to the children any more than anyothermilitary family who has been assigned to the Presidio in the past - less, infact, since asyou know the Army had reassigned us to Washington, D.C. long before the Presidioscandal ever occurred.Since Adams-Thompson’s false accusation first dragged us into this entireaffair, Ihave done considerable research concerning the rash of “abuse” scandals aroundthecountry these past few years. I have of course noted the recurring incidents of“identifications” from infants elicited by questioners using techniques whichweredeliberately engineered to produce predetermined answers - and which were laterexposed as such. From Mr. Hanson’s account of your statements to him during yourrecent telephone conversation, I am concerned that exactly this kind oftechnique isbeing employed here. If so, and if any further injustices should be inflicted onmy wifeand myself because of deliberately manufactured “evidence”, I will pursue everylegalrecourse to expose and prosecute anyone responsible. I think that thecourt-martialcharges I have already preferred against Adams-Thompson should substantiate myresolve in this regard.Mr. Hanson tells me that you again raised the issue of a polygraph test, sayingthat“it is the only way to clear us”. I thought we discussed that during our meetinginJanuary, but let me review it to ensure that there is no misunderstanding.First, as U.S.citizens, we have the right to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty of acrime,hence in the absence of any factual evidence should not have to submit to ahumiliatingexercise in order to “prove” our innocence.Secondly, all of my attorneys at PM&S have strongly advised against a polygraphteston the grounds that the results can be erroneous for any number of reasons. [Mywifewas told the same thing by professional polygraph administrators during her SanFrancisco City College criminology degree program.]Finally and most fundamentally, I do not believe that there are the slightestgroundsfor you or anyone else to presume that my wife or myself is a liar. For years Ihave held-and despite this disgraceful episode continue to hold - the highest level ofnationalsecurity clearance granted by the United States: “Top Secret/SpecialIntelligenceAccess”. This kind of clearance is not granted to liars. You have in yourpossessionsworn statements, under penalty of perjury, from both of us concerning thePresidioaffair. If you wish sworn statements from us concerning any matter not coveredbythose statements, you are welcome to so advise me at any time. [May I suggest apolygraph examination be administered to Adams-Thompson concerning the pointsbrought out in my sworn statement concerning him?]- 253 -I would also like to reemphasize, as I believe I mentioned during our Januarymeeting, that within the Army the swearing to false statements in support ofsomethingas serious as court-martial charges is itself a criminal offense punishableunder theUniform Code of Military Justice. Whether or not you ever charged me withanythingin San Francisco, if it were ever established that any element of my swornstatementwere false, the Army would prosecute me for that reason. Accordingly I think youwillagree that it would have been exceedingly stupid of me to say anything in thatstatement of whose truth I had the slightest doubt.Mr. Hanson also said that you would like to have a chronology of any travel ofmineto and from San Francisco since being assigned to Washington. My initialresponse tothat is that I do not see why my mere presence in my native city, where I havemaintained my home of record since I was born there in 1946, should in itselfassociate me with any crime which may take place in the city limits. Suppose Ihad stillbeen assigned to the Presidio Commander’s staff during 1986-87. Would that initselfmake me more of a suspect? In which case why don’t you suspect every personlivingon or near the Presidio during the scandal?Nevertheless I have no qualms whatever about substantiating my whereabouts as itmay be necessary. As you know, active-duty soldiers must account for theirmovementsofficially. They are either at their place of assignment or on official leave. Ihave on fileall leave-and-earnings statements (LESs) and official travel documents, togetherwithrecords of expenses, airline tickets, charge-card statements, and otherdocumentsneeded for my tax and military records. I have accounted completely for all ofthe timewhen I was assigned to the National Defense University, as Mr. Zimmerman hasverified to you. If you will identify to Mr. Zimmerman any specific day or daysyou havereason to feel are critical to your investigation, he will be able to provideyou withinformation concerning my location at that specific time and with suchsupportingdocumentation as is available. Mr. Zimmerman has advised me not to provideblanketstatements in the absence of such specific requests, on the grounds that to doso wouldmake me vulnerable to manufactured “evidence” in the form of alleged incidentsinvented for any day during which I may have been in the city.I had thought that in the course of our January meeting you would have resolvedany reasonable doubts you might have had concerning the Temple of Set, my wife,andmyself. As I mentioned to you at the time, I would have been happy to have metwithyou in August, and to have had you over to the house to inspect our bathtub,withouthaving to involve attorneys. Because of the way we were in fact treated,however, wewere forced to conclude that we were being deliberately and maliciouslypersecuted forno better reason than to prop up Sandi Gallant’s ridiculous “Satanism”scare-stories.Accordingly we have had to defend our personal safety - and the good name of ourlegitimate church - by careful attention to the guidance of Pillsbury, Madison &Sutro.- 254 -If this makes your job more difficult, consider that it makes my preferred wayofdiscussion more difficult as well. Despite that, I think that my wife and I havebent overbackward to be cooperative, and to try to positively resolve an extremely ugly,shocking, and traumatic situation which has savaged our lives for the pasthalf-year. Itwould be a welcome gesture to see the San Francisco Police Department appreciatethis, and to leave two innocent people alone.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. Aquino- 255 -Appendix 23: San Francisco Office of Citizen Complaints ArticleNew OCC Leadership Praised For Improving Investigationsby Peter Aronson, Recorder Staff WriterThe Recorder, Newspaper for U.S. District Court, Northern California SuperiorCourt,City and County of San Francisco, and the Municipal Court of San FranciscoApril 13, 1988Despite severe understaffing, a continuous budget crunch, and a huge casebacklog,the new leadership of the San Francisco Office of Citizen Complaints appears tobemaking a serious effort to transform the office into a bona fide police watchdogagency.That’s the view of John Crew, head of the American Civil Liberties Union policepractices unit.On Tuesday the OCC released to The Recorder preliminary statistics for 1987that,according to Crew, show the OCC seems to be investigating complaints morethoroughly than under the leadership of former OCC Director Frank Schober, Jr.,whoresigned last May amid complaints that too few citizen complaints were beingsustained.Last year 98 of the allegations made in 1,501 complaints against police officersinSan Francisco were found to have merit, according to the OCC’s new Director,MichaelA. Langer.In 1986 only 37 allegations made in 1,535 complaints were sustained by the OCC,Crew said.“By conservative estimates it appears that in 1987 they sustained at least twiceasmany allegations as before,” Crew said. “It’s hard to draw a conclusion becauseLangerhas been there only a short time, but it is encouraging.”Langer said be is too new on the job to say whether the statistics indicate theoffice isbecoming more effective as a watchdog. He said the OCC is completing a detailedstatistical analysis of the OCC’s 1987 case load and hopes to release it to thecity’s PoliceCommission this week.He and Crew cautioned that the preliminary statistics released Tuesday shouldnotbe misinterpreted. The 98 allegations sustained came from a total of 2,575allegationslodged by citizens in 1,501 complaints in 1987. Langer would not say what typesofcomplaints were upheld or how many different officers were named in theallegations.In general, Langer said, complaints against officers range from verbal abuse andimproper arrest to unnecessary force.Police Chief Frank Jordan refused comment on the OCC statistics.Another close observer of the OCC, Peter G. Keane, Chief Attorney in the SanFrancisco Public Defender’s Office, said it’s difficult to draw a conclusionfrom thetentative figures, but he said another barometer indicates Langer is having apositiveimpact.- 256 -“The Police Officers Association is pissed off with him,” Keane said. “That isthewatershed index.” He said POA leaders were angry with Langer’s acute attentiontocitizen complaints, as compared to the lackluster investigations under theSchoberadministration.But POA president Bob Berry said that, contrary to Keane’s impression, theAssociation believes Langer is a very credible administrator who is doing a finejobunder difficult budgetary constraints. The only problems so far have been a fewprocedural changes - the type that have occurred under prior OCCadministrations.“I think that comment by Peter Keane is way out of line. We have some proceduralproblems, but they are constant,” he said. “I don’t have any problems withLanger.”Langer, a former Chief of Detectives for the Skokie, Ill., Police Department,wasnamed to the $56,000-a-year job in November after a nationwide search.“My impression is that he’s trying to do a good job,” said Drucilla S. Ramey,Executive Director of the Bar Association of San Francisco. Citing onedifferencebetween Langer and Schober, Ramey said Langer wants willing BASF members toconduct discipline appeal hearings pro bono, while Schober did not.Langer said this cost-saving measure - the savings would be $64,000 - could beadopted during the city’s effort to reduce the projected $172-million deficit.He said thePolice Commission, which oversees the OCC, must approve this and otherrecommended changes.The OCC’s $857,000 annual budget supports a 14-member staff. With one employeeon sick leave and another transferred for disciplinary reasons, the office hasonly sixinvestigators and four clerks.He said each OCC investigator must handle more than 200 cases. He said in 1978each, investigator with the OCC’s predecessor, the Police Department’s InternalAffairsDivision, handled 23 cases.“I think we owe the citizens of San Francisco a good job, and I don’t think wecan dothat job unless we get more people,” Langer said. “A major, major problem islack ofpeople.”Langer said the office initially asked that its budget for 1988-89 be increasedto $1.3million, which would enable it to increase its staff to 22 employees. But thatrequestwas nixed, as were subsequent lower requests, Langer said.Now the director said he is faced with the problem of having to cut a budgetthat isalready too low. The most recent request calls for a 2- to 3-percent budget cut.If that is approved, Langer said that by shifting resources, the office wouldhope tohire two more investigators.This would require that the office make extreme cuts in other areas, includingeliminating all overtime pay, cutting word processing and all travel andreducingtraining.An additional personnel problem is that some members of the present OCC staffarenot working hard enough, Langer said. He said he is monitoring the staff closelyandthat he will seek their dismissal if their work habits don’t improve.- 257 -The total effect of the staff problems, Langer said, is that the office will notbe able towipe out a chronic backlog of complaints that now stands at 500 to 600 cases.Crew said that the city charter requires the city to fund the OCC so that it canpromptly and properly investigate citizen allegations of police misconduct.“If the city doesn’t give it the necessary resources, we’ll have to look atwhether thecity is fulfilling its legal responsibility,” Crew said.Although Langer said he cannot promise prompt investigation of the complaints,hesaid he is confident that every allegation is being thoroughly investigated byhis staff.“I want people to know there is honesty and integrity in this office,” he said.“If youget a complaint and it’s signed by Langer, I know the disposition is correct.”- 258 -Appendix 24: OCC Complaint - Officer Sandra Gallant, Star 1918April 8, 1988Narrative of Incident1. Since at least July 21, 1981 Officer Gallant has been maintainingconfidential“intelligence” files on the Temple of Set, a legitimate church with no record ofanycriminal actions, statements, or doctrines. The Temple of Set was incorporatedinCalifornia in 1975 as a church, and qualified in that same year for federal andstatetax-exempt recognition as such. [Tab A]. The singling-out of a church involvedinno illegal activity for police surveillance is a violation of the First andFourteenthAmendments to the U.S. Constitution pertaining to freedom of religion and equalprotection of the law.2. As part of this “intelligence” effort, Gallant has similarly maintainedconfidentialfiles on myself, as the Temple’s chief executive. I have no criminal recordwhatever,nor is there any probable cause to assume that I am involved in anythingcriminal.The “investigation” of a U.S. citizen for no other reason than his religion andreligious office is a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to theU.S.Constitution pertaining to freedom of religion and equal protection of the law.[Acopy of my personal resumé is attached at Tab B.]3. On July 21, 1981 Gallant (maiden name Daly) initiated contact with the U.S.Armyto insinuate that the existence of the Temple of Set as a “Satanic cult” shouldbeconsidered grounds for possible adverse action against myself and two other Armyofficers as members of the Temple. The Temple’s legitimate status is well-knowntothe Army; therefore Gallant’s effort failed. [Tab C]4. Gallant’s effort to initiate administrative action against the other officersandmyself became known to me through one of the other officer’s discovery of theTabB correspondence in his official file. I promptly went to Gallant’s office atthe Hallof Justice and saw Gallant and her associate Sergeant Jerry Belfield. GallantandBelfield admitted that they were keeping files on the Temple of Set and myself,butrefused to tell me what allegations they might contain, even when I made itexplicitly clear that I sought such information only in order to providedocumentation and other evidence of our legality and social responsibilitypertaining to any allegation. I did not insist upon knowing the name of anyinformant. The most that Gallant would do was to permit me to add a copy of theTemple of Set’s official information paper [Tab D] to the file.- 259 -5. Since that time Gallant has never once contacted the Temple of Set or myselfforinformation, or to obtain our/my version of information in her files. She hasadmitted to being in contact with at least two ex-members of the Temple of Setwho were expelled from the Temple for ethical misconduct, and who have sinceembarked on a campaign of vindictive misinformation about the Temple andmyself. This is unprofessional of Gallant in that, under the guise of“intelligence”,she accumulated adverse statements about the Temple and neither made nor"},{"pageContent":"tolerated any effort to critique such statements and present an objectivepicture.Thus she deliberately created a distorted and defamatory image of the Temple ofSet and myself, which she then proceeded to represent as objective truth to theSanFrancisco Police Department and other governmental and non-governmentalpersons and organizations.6. For several years it was impossible for me to find out what Gallant might besayingabout the Temple, its religion, and myself - because she only spoke and providedfiles to law-enforcement agencies. Gradually she began giving media interviewsinwhich she denounced our religion - Satanism - as horrifically criminal. [Tab E]Infact no registered member of the Temple of Set has ever been prosecuted for orconvicted of any such crimes as Gallant has regularly alleged.7. At an unknown date between 1981 and 1987, Gallant delivered a lecture on“Satanism” to a law-enforcement group - presumably the San Francisco PoliceDepartment. This lecture was virtually a continuous stream of distortions andseveral outright lies concerning the Satanic religion, the Temple of Set, andmyself.This lecture was taped, and in November 1987 my attorneys (Pillsbury, Madison &Sutro of San Francisco) obtained a copy of it. Included statements by Gallant,andmy corrections to them, are contained at Tab F. [A copy of the video tape can beprovided should you require it.]8. In 1985 Gallant produced and began to distribute to private organizations aswellas governmental ones, a series of “intelligence papers” on Satanism. Thesepaperscontain severe and defamatory distortions and falsifications concerning theSatanic religion. Since Gallant never checked any of this information with us,andnever provided me with a copy of these papers, I was not able to respond orobjectto them until 1987, when we received a set from the California Consortium ofChildAbuse Councils (a private, non-government organization). A copy of the Gallantpapers is included at Tab G, and my commentary to them is included at Tab H.9. I have recently been informed that, on October 23, 1986, Gallant spoke at arestricted-access Symposium on Child Abuse in Riverside, California. Reportedlyshe flashed a photograph of me on a screen, identified me, and said, “We haven’tgot anything on him yet, but we’re going to get him.” [This account was providedtome by a private investigator working for a Los Angeles legal firm, who has askedto- 260 -remain unidentified for fear of persecution. This source would probably bewillingto confirm this account to an authorized investigator from your office.]10. Being ignorant of the actual extent or impact of Gallant’s defamatorycampaign, wedid not take any action concerning it - until August 1987, when she andSergeant/Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff used the excuse of an obviously-groundless child-abuseallegation to execute a search-warrant on my San Francisco home. Although thesearch warrant was only for “evidence of child abuse”, no such evidence wasfoundor taken. Many official files and papers of the Temple of Set were confiscated,however - documents containing no illegal material whatever, but simplyconsisting of membership and administrative records of the church. [A moredetailed account of this incident is provided in my complaint filed againstSergeant/Inspector Pamfiloff on this same date.]11. Following the August 1987 incident I wrote two letters of protest to Chiefof PoliceFrank Jordan, neither of which was even answered at all. Copies of these lettersareattached at Tabs I and J.12. After it became clear that the S.F.P.D. would not on its own initiativecorrect theactions of Officers Gallant and Pamfiloff, my attorneys filed a motion in SanFrancisco Municipal Court to force the return of the Temple of Set’s and myconfiscated property. [Tab K] The District Attorney’s office has succeeded inaborting both scheduled hearings before Judge Moscone to date - presumably toprevent Moscone from seeing how conspicuously the confiscated property hasnothing to do with the search warrant, and also to prevent Gallant and Pamfilofffrom being questioned on the stand and the actual nature and quality ofGallant’s“intelligence” records from being exposed in court and to the public.13. In current interviews, such as that given to the Kansas City Times for itsMarch 26,1988 edition and the Santa Barbara News-Press on March 14, 1988 [Tab L],Gallant has stated “that there is no proof that the Temple of Set is involved incrime”. This would seem to make the continued retention of our, seized property,and indeed the continued maintenance of an intelligence file on us, all the moreunjustified.14. Since it is apparent that we are being prevented from exposing the facts ofthissituation in Municipal Court, we would normally pursue the alternative of legalaction in the State or Federal Courts. Before considering such a step, however,I amrequesting that your office, without seeking to find fault or fix blame for pastactions, act to correct the situation to what under law it should properly be.Hopefully this will resolve the problem constructively and with the minimum oftrouble to all concerned. I request:- 261 -a. That any files Gallant or her office may be maintaining on the Temple of Setormyself be destroyed, the maintenance of such files being a violation of theFirstand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Further that she beprohibited from amassing any new “intelligence” on the Temple or myself in theabsence of any specific judicial order to do so.b. As Gallant continues to associate the terms “Satanic” and “Satanism” withcrimes in general, and with child-molesting in particular [Tab L], that she beordered to cease the use of these religious terms when describing alleged crimesof a secular nature. These terms identify a bona fide and officially-recognizedreligious persuasion in the United States which in no sense advocates anycriminal behavior. Its religious terminology should not be associated with thecrimes of non-affiliated individuals misusing its symbols any more than theterm “Christian” should be used to describe crimes committed by persons usingits official symbols inappropriately.c. That Gallant be ordered to cease representing herself as an expert on eitheroccultism in general or on Satanism in particular. As the attacheddocumentation clearly establishes, she is an expert on neither, and herinaccurate accounts have caused great damage to the safety, security, andreputations of decent and law-abiding followers of the Satanic religionthroughout the nation.If these actions [and those requested in my related complaint of this dateconcerningSergeant/Inspector Pamfiloff are taken, I will be satisfied that a good-faitheffort by theCity of San Francisco to correct this situation has been made, and my wife and Iwouldconsider it appropriate withdraw our claims against the City of San Francisco.I verify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of myknowledge andbelief./s/ Michael A. Aquino[Notarized]- 262 -Appendix 25: OCC Complaint - Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff, Star 228April 8, 1988Narrative of Incident1. On August 14, 1987 Sergeant/Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff obtained and executed asearch warrant [Tab A] on my home in the city of San Francisco. This action wasimproper in that he did not adequately research and evaluate the allegationbeforeseeking the search warrant. Nor did he take any actions short of the drasticsearchwarrant - such as contacting me for an office interview, or coming by my homeandasking to look at the premises - to explore the allegation. In short heapproachedme not as a responsible citizen with an impeccable and distinguished civicrecord,but as someone whose home it was appropriate to forcibly invade, family tofrighten, and personal and religious property to confiscate.2. A detailed account of the obviously false and malicious nature of theallegation iscontained at Tab B. In the form of sworn statements by my wife and myself, thisinformation has also been provided to the U.S. Army in support of court-martialcharges which I have preferred against Chaplain Adams-Thompson.3. Upon executing the search warrant, Pamfiloff was able to ascertain that thechild’ssupposed “interior descriptions” did not match the actual interior of my home.This, together with the spurious nature of the chaplain’s allegations, shouldhavejustified his terminating the search. Nevertheless it continued.4. At the conclusion of the search, neither Pamfiloff nor Officer Sandi Gallantnor theteam of other officers accompanying them had found any evidence of childmolesting. Nevertheless Pamfiloff confiscated a number of articles and papersbelonging to our church (the Temple of Set) and to my wife and myself. A list ofwhat he confiscated is shown at Tab C.5. My attorneys were not able to obtain a copy of the Police Incident Report[Tab D]until August 28, so neither my wife nor I had any idea what the reason forPamfiloff’s raid had been. Upon seeing the Incident Report, I wrote Pamfilofftheletter at Tab E. He did not reply to it.6. When it became clear that Pamfiloff did not intend to respond to my letter, Iwrotethe letters to S.F.P.D. Chief Jordan contained at Tabs F and G. Jordan did notreply to either of them.- 263 -7. In October 1987 the search of my home was featured in the San Francisco andnational news media. The S.F.P.D. regularly referred to my wife and myself as“suspects”, stated that we were “under investigation”, and stated that“videotapes”had been among the items confiscated from our home. The obvious implicationwas that the videotapes contained something pedophiliac or otherwise criminal,whereas in actuality they contained nothing of the sort [see Tab C]. The effectofthe wording of the S.F.P.D. statements was to cause great harm to my wife’s andmy reputations, to provoke vandalism against our home, and to provokeanonymous threats of murder against us on our telephone answering machine.8. After it became clear that the S.F.P.D. would not on its own initiativecorrect theabuse of the search warrant and confiscations, my attorneys filed a motion inSanFrancisco Municipal Court to force the return of the Temple of Set’s and myconfiscated property. [Tab H] The District Attorney’s office obtained stayorders toabort both the first hearing and its follow-up before Judge Moscone - apparentlytoprevent Moscone from seeing how obviously the confiscated property has nothingto do with the search warrant, and to prevent Pamfiloff’s conduct of the“investigation” from being exposed.9. During the first Municipal Court hearing - before the stay order was served -Pamfiloff was briefly questioned on the stand and stated that he wasinvestigatingme for “child stealing and various subsections, child abuse, child neglect,childmolests, rapes”. After seeing this on a television news broadcast [a copy ofwhichcan be provided to your investigator if needed], I wrote Pamfiloff the letter atTabI. He did not reply to it.10. On December 2, 1987 Pamfiloff telephoned a San Francisco member of theTempleof Set, Walter Radtke, and asked to meet with him. During the meeting, asrecounted in Radtke’s letter to me later that same day: “Officer Pamfiloffrepeatedly stressed throughout our conversation his desire to nail you for childmolestation, stressing his conviction that you were perverts, homosexuals, andchronic abusers of children”.11. After the first Municipal Court hearing was halted by the D.A.’s office viaa stayorder obtained from the Superior Court (which we did not contest but which theD.A. refused to withdraw anyway), the S.F.P.D. agreed to release most of theconfiscated property to me. In January 1988 my wife and I flew to San Franciscototake delivery on it. At the same time we also requested a meeting with Pamfilofftoreview the rest of the property still being withheld by him.12. On January 15, 1988 my wife, my attorney Shawn Hanson, and I met withPamfiloff at his office. [Pamfiloff taped the conversation but we did not.] The- 264 -withheld property was reviewed and its irrelevance to any criminal activityclearlyestablished. A list of the withheld property is at Tab J.13. On January 28, with no further action by Pamfiloff to restore the property,myattorney Bernard Zimmerman wrote the District Attorney’s office the letter atTabK.14. Shortly thereafter Pamfiloff telephoned my attorney Shawn Hanson to rejecttheproposed solution & joint statement, and to say that he was now conductinginterviews with Presidio day-care children to see if any of them would“identify”me. On hearing this, I wrote Pamfiloff the 3/7 letter at Tab L. He did notanswer it.15. On March 17, following the Superior Court’s rejection of the D.A.’s stayorder, theMunicipal Court hearing was scheduled to resume. [Tab M] This time the D.A.prevented it from even beginning by another stay order, now obtained from theAppellate Court. Again we indicated that we would not contest it, and again theD.A. refused to withdraw it and allow Moscone to hear the case.16. Since it is apparent that we are being prevented from exposing the facts ofthissituation in Municipal Court, we would normally pursue the alternative of legalaction in the State or Federal Courts. Before considering such a step, however,I amrequesting that your office, without seeking to find fault or fix blame for pastactions, act to correct the situation to what under law it should properly be.Hopefully this will resolve the problem constructively and with the minimum oftrouble to all concerned. I request:a. That all of my wife’s and my personal property, and that of our church, berestored to us without further delay, and that the S.F.P.D. not retain anycopiesof this material.b. That any and all photographs taken of my home, my wife, and/or myself duringthe search of our home be destroyed along with their negatives as being anunjustified and unconstitutional invasion of our privacy.c. That Pamfiloff be ordered to cease this abusive, harassing, and completelyunjustified “investigation” of my wife, myself, and our church; and that he asanindividual not be assigned to any future investigation which might involve ourchurch or ourselves, as his prejudice against us has been conspicuously andconclusively established.If these actions [and those requested in my related complaint of this dateconcerningOfficer Gallant] are taken, I will be satisfied that a good-faith effort by theCity of San- 265 -Francisco to correct this situation has been made, and my wife and I wouldconsider itappropriate withdraw our claims against the City of San Francisco.I verify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of myknowledge andbelief./s/ Michael A.

Examiner“Massive S.F. Police Shake-Up”New Chief Casey to Reassign 16 of 22 Captains, Abolish Department IntelligenceUnitby Larry Maatz of the Examiner StaffMalcolm Glover of The Examiner Staff contributed to this report.December 19, 1990In one of the most far-reaching shake-ups in the history of the San FranciscoPoliceDepartment, newly-appointed Police Chief Willis Casey is disbanding theDepartment’scontroversial Intelligence Division and is reassigning 16 of the force’s 22captains.Within the week Casey also will announce the reassignment of more than half thedepartment’s 78 lieutenants. “Simply put, it’s time for a change,” Casey saidlateTuesday. “I can’t make it any more clear than that.”Casey plans to announce the changes Wednesday evening to the Police Commission,along with his appointment of two new patrol commanders, Captains Richard Shippyand James Arnold.The reassignment of the Department’s captains comes as no surprise, Casey havingmade it clear as he assumed command in November that a shake-up was due.“There’snothing punitive about it,” he said Tuesday. “I just want a new mix. I want toconfrontpeople with new challenges, new situations. A lot of these people have beenwhere theyare for far too long. They really don’t know what they can do. I want to givethem thechance to surprise themselves about how good they really are.”But the dismembering of the Department’s Intelligence unit, long the target ofprotest, minority and lifestyle groups, comes as a bombshell. Again Casey said,it wastime for a change. “This didn’t come on me yesterday,” he said. “I’ve beenthinking onthis for a long time, but I couldn’t act on it. But now I can. This is 1990,going on 1991.Whatever may or may not have been appropriate in the ’50s just isn’t appropriatenow.This is a police department, not the CIA.”Of the Intelligence Division’s 22 officers, 14 assigned to gang-taskforce workarebeing moved to the Vice Division. “Their work largely revolved around Chinatowngambling anyway,” Casey said, “so better that they work there.”Of the remaining officers, two will be assigned to investigate hate crimes underanewly formed Special Investigation Division, and the other eight will bereassignedwithin 30 days, Casey said.“I want the officers in this Department to be developing intelligence relativetofighting crime and then acting on it,” Casey said, “so I’m putting thoseofficers with thatexpertise in jobs where they can act on it, and I’m going to expect them to dojust that. Idon’t think it’s a proper police function to gather [intelligence] informationon variousgroups just because it’s there and then file it away.- 270 -“If we can’t act on it in the service of this city, then it’s a waste of ourtime,” Caseysaid, “and with our manpower shortage, we can’t afford that kind of waste.”Casey said the captains’ reassignments came after nearly three weeks ofinterviews,and that all the captains had been assured they would have a minimum of twoyears ontheir new assignments to put their ideas to work.“I’ve made it clear to them that they’re going to be given more freedom ofactionthan they’ve ever had,” Casey said. “I also made it clear that I’m going to holdthemaccountable for their actions.”- 271 -Appendix 28: Michael Aquino Sworn Statement - First A-T ChargesI, Lieutenant Colonel Michael A. Aquino, want to make the following statementunder oath:1. From approximately October 1986 to the present time, the Presidio of SanFrancisco child-care center has been the subject of many allegations concerningsexualabuse of the children left there. A Baptist minister who worked at the center,one GaryHambright, has been indicted for such abuse but has not yet been tried. Theinvestigation at the Presidio has been conducted by the FBI in conjunction withtheArmy CID and the San Francisco Police Department.2. Prior to July 1986 I was assigned to the Presidio headquarters as USARAdvisor tothe Presidio Commander. Some time before my reassignment to Washington in July1986, Adams-Thompson arrived on post and was also assigned to the Presidioheadquarters.3. From July 1986 through July 1987 my wife and I were living in Washington,D.C.,where I was a student in the resident course of the Industrial College of theArmedForces, National Defense University, Fort McNair.4. Following the end of the ICAF year (extended through July 1987 because of myparticipation in a George Washington University M.P.A. option), my wife and Itraveledto San Francisco to visit our home-of-record there for a month before moving onto St.Louis for my next PCS assignment.5. On 12 August 1987 Chaplain Adams-Thompson, without my knowledge or theknowledge of the Presidio Commander, falsely accused me and my wife to the FBIandthe San Francisco Police Department of having sexually molested his infantstepdaughter at Gary Hambright’s home during the period September-October 1986.Adams-Thompson alleges that he made the accusation based solely on commentselicited from his 3-year-old stepdaughter (who was age 2 in October 1986).6. Approximately a week before Adams-Thompson made his accusation, a federaljudge had ruled that unsupported statements elicited from another 3-year-oldchildwould be incompetent due to the child’s age, hence inadmissible in court. Thisrulingwas highly publicized in the San Francisco media, and Adams-Thompson wascertainlyaware of it. According to the official SFPD Incident Report (Attachment #A),Adams-Thompson’s stepdaughter was questioned by the FBI on 14 January 1987 and did notmake any statements about being molested at all, much less by my wife or myself,or atour San Francisco home. Only after intensive child-therapy, which has become- 272 -nationally notorious for conditioning young children to fabricate molestationstories[see paragraph #22 below], did Adams-Thompson represent that his stepdaughterwasmolested. To date it has not been established that the child was ever molestedat all.7. I have never had anything to do with either Kinsey M. Almond (Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s stepdaughter) or any other child involved with the Presidio day-carecenter. I have never molested any child in my life. I have never used or beenknown bythe nickname “Mikey”.8. The officer corps of the Presidio headquarters garrison is not large, and itwouldhave been quite conspicuous to Adams-Thompson that I had not been present forgarrison activities for over a year. It would have been equally easy for him tohaveascertained that I had been reassigned to Washington in July 1986, merely byaskingthe officer personnel office or any senior officer in the garrison headquarters.Sinceonly one USAR officer per year is selected nationwide to attend ICAF, myselection waswell-known at the Presidio.9. Therefore, even if Adams-Thompson’s stepdaughter did make an allegation,Adams-Thompson had two reasons not to initiate formal action as a consequence:(a)the established incompetence of 2/3-year-olds in even current testimony, and (b)theease with which he could have acted to ascertain my Washington PCS assignmentduring the entire Presidio child-care scandal. Instead he disregarded the formerandtook no steps concerning the latter before contacting the FBI.10. On 12 August 1987 my wife and I went shopping at the Presidio PX. We wereunaware of the presence of Adams-Thompson and/or any other members of hisfamily,nor would have recognized them in any case as we had never met them. Accordingtothe facts as set forth in Attachment #A, Adams-Thompson stated that hisstepdaughterreacted to my appearance upon seeing me at the PX. Since I have a prominentwidow’speak and sharply-pointed eyebrows (Attachment #B/ICAF 1987 Yearbook), it is notuncommon for children [or even adults] to react to me. Adams-Thompson did notcallmy attention to his presence or ask me any questions. Instead he prompted hisstepdaughter several times to elicit what he alleges was the child’sidentification of mywife and myself as two individuals who had molested her about ten months earlieratthe home of Gary Hambright.11. Adams-Thompson’s statement that my wife did not appear until later in the PXparking lot is false, since at no time was she separated from me during ourshoppingtrip. The notion that his stepdaughter could have identified either of us isalso false,since we have never met any members of the Adams-Thompson family. [Adams-Thompson himself obviously recognized me from my Presidio assignment a yearearlier, since he accused me by name to the FBI. I was not in uniform during thePXshopping trip, hence was not wearing a nametag.]- 273 -12. The detailed story which Adams-Thompson says he received from hisstepdaughter is impossible for a 3-year-old infant to have assembled, much lessrecalled from a year earlier at age 2. It includes such details as theidentification of amovie camera [as distinct from a still camera] and other details which no2-year-oldwould either notice, recognize, or retain. It is genital-obsessive to adisgusting degree:certainly the product of an adult perversion rather than a 2-year-old’s actualperception. The story was quite clearly fabricated by an adult and tutored intothe child- either by Adams-Thompson himself or by some other adult who had instructedher.13. After Adams-Thompson made his allegations to the FBI, an FBI agent thendrovethe child to my San Francisco street address, presumably still in the company ofAdams-Thompson. Allegedly the child then identified my building as the “home ofGary Hambright”. This too is impossible, as the child had never been inside thebuilding [nor has any other member of the Adams-Thompson family - nor GaryHambright (whom we have never met) - nor any other child involved with thePresidioday-care center]. If she identified the building, it is either because she wastaken therein advance and instructed to “identify” the building later, or because the“identification” was deliberately coached from her either by Adams-Thompson orbythe FBI agent. Both Adams-Thompson and the FBI agent knew that my building wasnot the residence of Hambright, furthermore, because Hambright’s actual addresselsewhere in San Francisco is included on the SFPD incident report (Attachment#A).14. As a consequence of these accusations by Adams-Thompson, the San FranciscoPolice Department obtained and exercised a search warrant on my home on 14August1987 - from 9 PM to 1 AM, to the utter surprise and shock of my wife and myself,whocould do nothing but watch while our entire flat was ransacked and our mostpersonaleffects pawed through and photographed. The police found that the interior“descriptions” alleged to have been given by the Adams-Thompson child did notmatchthe interior of my home, and they found no evidence whatever of any child abuse/pornography activities. They confiscated a selection of family and church papers&photographs, and other articles so that, in my attorney’s opinion, they wouldnot haveto return to the judge empty-handed. Since it is SFPD policy to not returnseizedproperty until a judge orders it, I have had to initiate litigation accordingly.On 24November 1987 San Francisco District Attorney George Butterworth stated in aDeclaration to the Superior Court, under penalty of perjury: “I am informed andbelievethat there is currently pending no criminal prosecution, either locally orfederally, towhich the property seized in the search warrant at issue pertains.” No chargesbased oneither Adams-Thompson’s or any other allegations have been filed against my wifeormyself.15. I did not learn of Adams-Thompson’s actions until 28 August 1987, when acopyof the SFPD Incident Report was made available. As Adams-Thompson was at thattime still assigned to the Presidio, I immediately advised the Deputy Commanderof the- 274 -Presidio, Colonel D. Peter Gleichenhaus. Simultaneously I sent Adams-Thompson aletter (Attachment #C) affirming my noninvolvement and demanding a letter ofapology and retraction for his conduct. He sent no letter by way of reply. Onthe sameday that my letter would have been delivered to his Presidio address, however,anunsigned card (Attachment #D) with no return address was posted to my St. Louisaddress from San Francisco. It shows a repulsive male transvestite and theprintedmessage “BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!” together with the typed message “YOUPOMPOUS JERK!”. That Adams-Thompson sent this card is suggested by the date ofits posting, together with its addressing to my new St. Louis address, of whichno one inSan Francisco other than family and a few close friends was as yet aware.[Adams-Thompson knew the address, of course, because it appears as the return addresson the28 August letter I had sent to him.]16. On 10 September I sent a second letter (Attachment #E) to Adams-Thompson athis subsequent duty assignment with the 25th Infantry Division. I enclosed aphotocopy of the card and requested him to deny having sent it if he were notthesource of it. No answer was ever received. For these reasons I conclude that heindeedsent the card. [The “transvestite” theme also appears in the allegations he madeto theFBI/SFPD concerning my wife and myself - neither of whom are or ever have beentransvestites.]17. I thus conclude not only that an Army officer and chaplain made anirresponsibleand knowingly false criminal accusation against another officer and his wife,but alsothat, when the facts were subsequently brought to his attention and an informalapology requested, his response was one not only of no regret whatever, butindeed ofvulgar and obscene insolence.18. Why should Adams-Thompson have behaved this way towards my wife andmyself, since we had had no previous contact with him or his family whatever?19. During my assignment to the Presidio garrison, it was well-known on postthat Iwas, as High Priest of the Temple of Set, the chief official of the nation’slargest andmost prominent legitimate Satanic church. Although I did not advertise orencouragepublicity within the military in any way, my unusual religion was commonknowledgeto the post commanders under whom I served, the Presidio Catholic (ColonelChristoph) and Protestant (Colonel Autry) chaplains, and most if not all of theotherofficers, enlisted personnel, and civilians on post. As one of the subordinategarrisonchaplains, it is inconceivable that Adams-Thompson was not also aware of it.20. At no time did Adams-Thompson speak to me about it, nor make any otherinquiry to the Temple of Set about its standing, beliefs, or practices. Had hedone so, hewould have learned that since its founding in 1975 it has remained a legitimatereligious institution, incorporated in California and possessing full state andfederal- 275 -tax-exempt recognition as a church. It has no record whatever of any misdemeanororfelony activities. Its public information documents make it quite explicit thatit neitherengages in nor advocates any illegal activities whatever, nor permits anyoneunder theage of 18 to affiliate or to attend any of its functions. [My religiousaffiliation has beencontinuously known to the Army since my commissioning in 1968, and has neverbeenthe basis for any adverse official concern or action.]21. I find it inescapable to conclude, therefore, that Adams-Thompson’s actionstowards my wife and myself were the result of religious intolerance and bigotry:thefear and hatred of a passionate, professional Christian clergyman for somethingwhichhe [ignorantly] thought to be a threat to his preferred religion. Hence hisactions werenot motivated by a sincere, logical conviction on his part that my wife and Ihad in factmolested his stepdaughter, but rather by his cold and deliberate perception ofanopportunity to inflict great harm upon us and our church with a devastatingaccusation.22. In San Francisco Chronicle coverage of the Presidio child-care scandal on 10August 1987, it was made clear that the parents making the allegations were verymuchaware of the extremely sensational McMartin and Kern County “Satanicchild-abuse”cases of the previous two years, in which young children - proved later to havebeencoached to make false statements by parents, therapists, and law-enforcementofficials-obediently reported sexual abuse, murder, and cannibalism at the hands of“Sataniccults” at day-care centers. After exhaustive investigation and the ruining ofthe lives ofmany innocent persons who had neither abused children nor been Satanists(legitimateor otherwise), both scandals ended with the allegations of “Satanic child abuse”beingshown to be completely without basis. The Kern County case in particular endedwiththe California Attorney General severely criticizing the investigators andofficialsinvolved for the impulsive and unprofessional way in which they had proceeded.23. The publicity accorded these two cases - and a flurry of subsequent“copycat”cases around the country - have nonetheless generated a media image of Satanistsashabitual child-abusers or child-murderers. As law-enforcement officials haverepeatedly admitted, however, not a single such connection between child-abuseandSatanism has ever been established. The published texts of contemporarylegitimateSatanism, most prominently Anton LaVey’s Satanic Bible and the Temple of Set’sCrystal Tablet of Set, contain strong and explicit prohibitions against any andall harmto children, sexual or otherwise. [See Attachment #F.]24. I therefore conclude that Adams-Thompson deliberately intended to smear mygood name, that of my wife, and that of our church with this abominableaccusation,counting on media sensationalism and public ignorance not only to compound thedamage to us, but also to shield him from the consequences of falsely andmaliciouslyaccusing a fellow Army officer of a serious felony. To date it appears that hehas beenquite successful in this. No official actions have been taken against himwhatever. The- 276 -Presidio Judge Advocate’s office excuses such inaction as being a necessaryconsequence of the “ongoing investigation” into the Presidio scandal as a whole.This isabsolutely unjustified, since the facts surrounding Adams-Thompson’s behavior inthisincident [cited in this statement] are all clearly established, and since Adams-Thompson’s false accusations against me are not connected with any molestationactivities which may have been perpetrated at the day-care facility by Hambrightoranyone else. To delay justice in Adams-Thompson’s case is not only to allow himtosavor what he has done; it is to indefinitely perpetuate and aggravate thecontinuingpublic ordeal of my wife and myself.25. My family and I have endured four months of protracted agony because ofAdams-Thompson’s vile accusation. We have been questioned by scores of militaryassociates, family friends, and business associates. We and our church have beencaricatured sensationally and inaccurately by many commercial media. Ourpersonalprivacy and the religious privacy of our church have been and continue to beregularlyviolated as though we are mere freaks for public entertainment; we are forced torespond to continued inquiries only to try to preclude at least the more bizarredistortions in the inevitable coverage. We have learned to our distress thateven themost polite declining of interviews usually results in hostile distortions bythe reportersin question.26. My wife and I have received several death and arson threats on our telephoneanswering machine. The most recent one was on January 1, 1988, in which ananonymous caller stated that we would both be killed this year. Our SanFranciscohome has been vandalized, forcing me to spend over $3,000 in repairs andprotectivereinforcement. Our tenants in the building have also been harassed andtraumatized byvandalism.27. After a lifetime of cordial relations with the San Francisco PoliceDepartment, Inow find myself in an adversarial legal battle against them because of theirbureaucratic refusal to reverse the search/confiscation action they took solelyon thestrength of Adams-Thompson’s accusation. This legal action has already cost over$6,000 in attorney’s fees, and will certainly cost several tens if not hundredsofthousands of additional dollars if we are forced to pursue the matter into stateand/orfederal court to restore the good name and property of ourselves and our church.[SeeAttachment #G: letter to my attorney, Mr. Bernard Zimmerman, dated December 27,1987.]28. Add to this the countless man-hours the Department of the Army has now hadtodevote to responding to reporters concerning this affair, and the damage to theArmythat has nonetheless resulted from some reporters’ crude castigations of theArmy formy religious “oddity” as though it were something despicable. Even my Top Secretsecurity clearance, though not compromised in the least by my religion nor even- 277 -relevant to this situation, has been headlined as though it were a scandal initself. Andadd to this the very notion that a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army “may be linkedtochild-molesting at the Presidio” [as the stories “carefully” state], whichnecessarilyreflects that much more adversely upon the Army officer corps as a whole.AffidavitI, Lieutenant Colonel Michael A.

Article 133 - Conduct unbecoming an officer and gentlemana. Text.“Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conductunbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial maydirect.”b. Elements.(1) That the accused did or omitted to do certain acts; and(2) That, under the circumstances, these acts or omissions constituted conductunbecoming an officer and gentleman.c. Explanation.(1) Gentleman. As used in this article, “gentleman” includes both male andfemale commissioned officers, cadets, and midshipmen.(2) Nature of offense. Conduct violative of this article is action or behaviorin anofficial capacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing the person as an officer,seriouslycompromises the officer’s character as a gentleman, or action or behavior in anunofficial or private capacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing the officerpersonally,seriously compromises the person’s standing as an officer. There are certainmoralattributes common to the ideal officer and the perfect gentleman, a lack ofwhich isindicated by acts of dishonesty, unfair dealing, indecency, indecorum,lawlessness,injustice, or cruelty. Not everyone is or can be expected to meetunrealistically highmoral standards, but there is a limit of tolerance based on customs of theservice andmilitary necessity below which the personal standards of an officer, cadet, ormidshipman cannot fall without seriously compromising the person’s standing asanofficer, cadet, or midshipman or the person’s character as a gentleman. Thisarticleprohibits conduct by a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman which, takingallthe circumstances into consideration, is thus compromising. This articleincludes actsmade punishable by any other article, provided these acts amount to conductunbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Thus, a commissioned officer who stealsproperty violates both this article and Article 121. Whenever the offensecharged is thesame as a specific offense set forth in this Manual, the elements of proof arethe sameas those set forth in the paragraph which treats that specific offense, with the- 281 -additional requirement that the act or omission constitutes conduct unbecominganofficer and gentleman.(3) Examples of offenses. Instances of violation of this article includeknowinglymaking a false official statement; dishonorable failure to pay a debt; cheatingon anexam; opening and reading a letter of another without authority; using insultingordefamatory language to another officer in that officer’s presence or about thatofficer toother military persons; being drunk and disorderly in a public place; publicassociationwith known prostitutes; committing or attempting to commit a crime involvingmoralturpitude; and failing without good cause to support the officer’s family.d. Lesser included offense. Article 80 - attempts.e. Maximum punishment. Dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, andconfinement for a period not in excess of that authorized for the most analogousoffense for which a punishment is prescribed in this Manual, or, if none isprescribed,for 1 year.- 282 -Appendix 31: Michael Aquino Sworn Statement -First A-T Charges, Updated/ExpandedI, Lieutenant Colonel Michael A. Aquino, want to make the following statementunder oath:Concerning the background of the 1986 Presidio child-care scandal:1. In recent years there has been a nationwide epidemic of “child-care centersexabuse” scandals, all imitating the highly-publicized McMartin Preschool case inLosAngeles. Sometimes the mass accusations have been directed against parents, moreoften against professional day-care workers. Such scandals have almost alwaysbegunin the same way: sensational allegations by one or two individuals, followed bytheintensive and exhaustive grilling of children by “child therapists” specializingin theinvention of sex-molestation symptoms, followed by spiraling mass investigationsandindictments, followed by the eventual collapse of the case after immense,extensivedamage to the innocent parties involved. A thorough analysis of the epidemic isincluded as Attachment #A ( Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tennessee, January17-22,1988).2. This epidemic has extended to U.S. military services as well, including 15U.S.Army day-care centers and elementary schools by November of 1987. In late 1986itwas the turn of the Presidio of San Francisco.3. On September 28, 1986 the San Francisco Examiner began a series of eightfront-page stories, with many dramatic maps and photographs, describing the “day-caresexabuse” epidemic sweeping the country. A copy of this series of articles isenclosed asAttachment #B.4. Approximately a month after this series of articles appeared, the wife of acaptainassigned to the Presidio, Joyce Tobin, decided that her son might have beenanallyraped by a Presidio day-care worker by the name of Gary Hambright. Neverthelessshedid not take the child for a medical examination until a week later. Then shetook thechild to a civilian community hospital, where Dr. Kevin Coulter issued a reportsayingthat the child’s anus showed “tears” and was enlarged. Based upon this theTobinscomplained to the Presidio Commander, and in December 1986 a “task force”containing representatives from the professional sex-abuse office where Coulterworked was advising the Army to expect multiple victims.5. In April 1988 on a KTVU television news documentary [Attachment #C], Coulteradmitted that he had later retracted his initial report about “tears”, sayingthat the- 283 -Tobin child’s anus showed only “normal grooves”. Nevertheless he said that thechild’sanus had seemed “unusually large”. On the same documentary pediatrician AnnParker, M.D. was asked about this statement. She responded that there are manyperfectly normal causes for an enlarged anus in a child of that age, such aslarge bowelmovements. Tobin’s own mother stated in an affidavit that the child had beenexperiencing large bowel movements at the time.6. Letters were mailed to 242 Presidio parents, and a checklist of “symptoms” ofchild sex-abuse was circulated [see Attachment #C]. Such checklists, created by“therapists” professionally dedicated to the finding of sex-abuse, have becomenationally notorious for their inclusion of virtually every normal interest oraction of achild as a “symptom”. As a consequence of Michelle Remembers, a book written byoneof these opportunists, the industry has now dressed up such checklists with“Satanicritual” symptoms. [See Attachment #A, pages #30-31.] A copy of one of the morewidely-circulated and often-copied lists by therapist Catherine Gould isenclosed asAttachment #D.7. In this list it will be seen that many ordinary and evenmutually-contradictoryforms of behavior are symptoms of “Satanic ritual abuse and sexual abuse”, forexample a child who is either rebellious or compliant, who gets angry orplay-acts or islazy in school, or who touches his or her genitals. The checklist also warnsparents thatany official investigation will be incompetent, and also that even the mostexcellentreputation of a school or day-care facility means nothing. In short, a climatecomparable to the witch-hunts of medieval Europe is created, in which anythingandeverything is “proof” of witchcraft and no defense is admissible.8. In the predictable pattern other children were interviewed by a therapist,reportedly one Debbie Hickey either assigned or contracted to the Presidio’sLettermanArmy Medical Center. According to the KTVU documentary, Hickey proceeded to findsymptoms of sex-abuse in several of the children, including her own. Theaccounts, aslater reported by the press, were of the fantastic and incoherent variety normaltoprevious episodes of the epidemic. Children said that they had guns pointed atthem,that they had played baseball with human excrement, and that “Mr. Gary”[Hambright]had a shark in a bowl on his kitchen table which he took a child home with himto feed.All this was supposed to “prove” mass sexual molestation at the center.9. Apart from this “therapy”, there are no published accounts that any childattending the Presidio center was ever taken to an emergency room forexamination/care because of an apparent adult rape/sodomy, or that upon the publicizing ofthescandal itself any medical examinations of any of the children revealed anyevidence ofsexual molestation. Apart from Coulter’s waffling and uncertain statementsconcerningthe Tobin child, there is no medical evidence that anything happened to any ofthechildren.- 284 -10. As a consequence of medical examinations given to the children when thescandal commenced, it was first given out to the press that five of the childrenhadchlamydia, a venereal disease which can be transmitted by sexual contact. It waslaterbrought out, however, that the tests used to detect chlamydia were so inaccuratethatnone of them could be used as evidence. Since nothing more was heard about thechlamydia allegations, it is reasonable to assume that rechecks of the samechildren bymore reliable testing procedures either did not occur or produced negativeresults.According to San Francisco Chronicle reporter Edward Lempinen, chlamydia canalsobe transmitted from a mother to her unborn fetus. In the absence of any sign ofadultrape on the children involved, it is reasonable to suppose that if any child hadthedisease, it was contracted this way. No evidence has been published to indicatethat themothers of the children in question were examined and found to be free of thediseasethemselves, or had no medical history of being treated for it since the birth oftheirchildren. Presumably for the Army to insist that this more probable explanationbeinvestigated would have angered the women in question, who were alreadyvehementlycriticizing the Army, to even greater antagonism.11. A scare in the local media occurred when one child was initially reported astesting positively for AIDS. This test result was later shown to be false.Nevertheless, aswith the chlamydia, this development continued to be brought up as “additionalevidence” that sex-abuse had taken place.12. In February 1988 a federal judge dismissed all of the charges againstHambrightas being unsubstantiated. Only the original charge concerning the Tobin childremained. Significantly by this point in time, the charge in the case of theTobin childhad been changed from sodomy to oral copulation. This suggests that evenCoulter’samended report of an “enlarged anus” and the circumstances surrounding theinitialcomplaint that began the whole episode were now considered too spurious to takeseriously.13. Finally the Tobins, who were now faced with being the sole accusers ofHambright, suddenly refused permission for their child to be used as evidence“on theadvice of his therapist”. Therefore the U.S. Attorney dropped the remainingchargeagainst Hambright in February 1988.14. Joyce Tobin and a few other parents appeared actively and enthusiasticallyinlocal newspaper, magazine, and television talk-show interviews during thescandal.Following the dropping of the charges against Hambright, these parents,according tothe April 20, 1988 San Francisco Chronicle, “accused prosecutors of being‘highlyirresponsible’ and charged that the Army’s response had been ‘pitiful’”. Theyangrilyprotested the opening of a new day-care center at the Presidio. And finally theyfiled 53claims against the Army for a total of $55 million. These claims remain pendingat thistime.- 285 -15. In summary, based upon all published evidence to date in all of the SanFrancisco bay area media and the Army Times, there is not a single piece ofevidence other than coached “therapy” that any child was ever sexuallyabused or molested at the Presidio daycare center. Accordingly the $55 millionclaims against the U.S. Army are not substantiated. The media-courting militancyofthe ringleader group of parents is most probably explained by the realizationthat theyhave already gone too far in hurling the accusations that caused such a damagingwitch-hunt. To backtrack on them now would be to admit that they had causedgrievous and totally unjustified harm to innocent people -and might subject themtodefamation legal suits as well.Concerning the attack on my wife and myselfby Captain (Chaplain) Lawrence Adams-Thompson:16. For several years prior to July 1986 I was assigned to the Presidioheadquartersas USAR Advisor to the Presidio Commander. Some time before my reassignment toWashington in July 1986, Captain (Chaplain) Lawrence Adams-Thompson arrived onpost and was also assigned to the Presidio headquarters as an assistant postchaplain.17. From July 1986 through July 1987 my wife and I were living in Washington,D.C., where I was a student in the resident course of the Industrial College oftheArmed Forces, National Defense University, Fort McNair.18. Following the end of the ICAF year (extended through July 1987 because of myparticipation in a George Washington University Master of Public Administrationdegree option), my wife and I traveled to San Francisco to visit ourhome-of-recordthere for a month before moving on to St. Louis for my next PCS assignment.19. On 12 August 1987 Chaplain Adams-Thompson, without my knowledge or theknowledge of the Presidio Commander, contacted the FBI and the San FranciscoPoliceDepartment and falsely accused me and my wife of having sexually molested hisinfantstepdaughter at Gary Hambright’s home during the period September-October 1986.Adams-Thompson alleges that he made the accusation based solely on commentselicited from his 3-year-old stepdaughter (who was age 2 in September 1986).20. According to the official SFPD Incident Report (Attachment #E), Adams-Thompson’s stepdaughter was questioned by the FBI on 14 January 1987 and deniedbeing molested by Hambright or anyone else. There is no evidence to indicatethat thechild was ever taken by her parents to Letterman Army Medical Center, hospitalemergency room, or medical doctor at any time during the September-October 1986time period for examination or treatment of the kind of injuries that a2-year-old wouldnecessarily sustain had she been both sodomized and raped by two adult males.Hadthere been any such evidence, it wouldn’t have taken the FBI until January tointerview- 286 -the child, nor would any denials by her at that time have been taken seriously,nor forthat matter would she have had any reason to deny such an assault. It also wouldhavebeen included in the SFPD report, which it is not. It is therefore evident thatuntil theydecided to have the child therapized, the Adams-Thompsons had no grounds tothinkthat she had been assaulted -and in fact every physical/medical/anatomicalreason toknow that she had not been assaulted. [By a FOIA request to LAMC I acted toverifythese facts from the SFPD incident report. This information has been denied tome, butshould be pursued by the investigating officer. See Attachment #F.]21. Adams-Thompson, apparently the chaplain who had counseled the Tobins toinitiate their actions to begin the scandal and witch-hunt the previous year,placed hisstepdaughter in therapy in February 1988 despite his knowledge of her lack ofanycorresponding injury and her denial of abuse during the FBI interview. Afterfoursessions the therapist purportedly told Adams-Thompson that his stepdaughter wasone of the “victims” and produced the “Mikey & Shamby at Hambright’s house”story.[SFPD report]22. Exactly how much of this story the therapist [presumably the same DebbieHickey whose “therapy” had created the avalanche of other fantastic abuseaccounts]invented, and how much Adams-Thompson and his wife invented, will not be knownuntil a written record of the therapy sessions is obtained. The investigatingofficershould obtain a copy of this record.23. If the details of the story contained in the SFPD report are not included inthetherapy record, then it is evident that that story was simply invented wholecloth byLawrence and/or Michele Adams-Thompson.24. If the story appears on the therapy record, the Adams-Thompsons may stillhaveinvented it if they coached the child to recite it before or between the therapysessions.Whether the AdamsThompsons or the therapist invented the story, however, theclearfact remains is that because it directly contradicts what the Adams-Thompsonsknew tobe the physical condition of the child during the time-period in question, theyhadevery reason to know that it was a false account.25. It was stated in the SFPD report that the Adams-Thompsons thought theirdaughter was molested because she “started having nightmares and would wetherself”.It is obvious that 2-year-olds may occasionally wet themselves or havenightmares formany reasons having nothing to do with sexual attack. In the absence of anyphysicalevidence whatever, it is preposterous for the Adams-Thompsons to have concludedfrom ordinary infant events such as these that rape and sodomy had occurred.26. At this point I state for the record that I have never had anything to dowitheither Kinsey M. Almond (Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s stepdaughter) or any other- 287 -child involved with the Presidio day-care center. I have never molested anychild in mylife. I have never used or been known by the nickname “Mikey”. Neither KinseyAlmond, nor Gary Hambright, nor any other Presidio day-care child or worker haseverbeen inside my San Francisco home.27. The officer corps of the Presidio headquarters garrison is not large, and itwouldhave been quite conspicuous to Adams-Thompson that I had not been present forgarrison activities for over a year. It would have been equally easy for him tohaveascertained that I had been reassigned to Washington in July 1986, merely byaskingthe officer personnel office or any senior officer in the garrison headquarters.Sinceonly one USAR officer per year is selected nationwide to attend the IndustrialCollegeof the Armed Forces, my selection was well-known at the Presidio.28. Therefore Lawrence Adams-Thompson had a clear reason not to initiate anyaccusation against anyone, and even more of a reason not to initiate one againstanofficer who he had known to be gone from the garrison for over a year.Nevertheless hemade the accusation against us.29. Concerning the 12 August 1987 account by Adams-Thompson in the SFPDreport:a. On that day my wife and I went shopping at the Presidio PX. We were unawareof the presence of Adams-Thompson and/or any other members of his family, norwould have recognized them in any case as we had never met them. Adams-Thompsonstated that his stepdaughter reacted to my appearance upon seeing me at the PX.SinceI have a prominent widow’s peak and sharplypointed eyebrows (Attachment #G /ICAF1987 Yearbook), it is not uncommon for children [or even adults] to react towhat theyconsider an unusual appearance.b. Adams-Thompson did not call my attention to his presence nor ask me anyquestions. Instead he prompted his stepdaughter several times to elicit what heallegeswas the child’s identification of my wife and myself as two individuals who hadmolested her about ten months earlier at the home of Gary Hambright. Why didAdams-Thompson not immediately leave his stepdaughter with his wife, who hestateswas also at the PX, and discuss the matter with me? It is unreasonable for himto havefelt in any personal danger from a field-grade officer surrounded by crowds ofshoppers. Had he not wanted to bring up the subject there, he could haverequestedthat we meet immediately with the Presidio Chaplain (Colonel Jerry Autry) or theCommander or Deputy Commander or any other appropriate military official for adiscussion. Instead Adams-Thompson left the PX without making his presence knownto me or my wife at all.- 288 -c. Adams-Thompson’s statement that my wife did not appear until later in the PXparking lot is completely false, since at no time was she separated from meduring ourshopping trip. We had gone to the PX specifically to purchase a microwave oven.Bothof us picked it out from the floor samples, and then my wife held the two setsof glassdoors open for me as I carried the heavy oven out to our car.d. The account that his stepdaughter could have identified either of us is alsofalse, since we have never met any members of the Adams-Thompson family. [Adams-Thompson himself obviously recognized me from my Presidio assignment a yearearlier, since he accused me by name to the FBI. I was not in uniform during thePXshopping trip, hence was not wearing a nametag.]30. Instead of consulting either with Colonel Autry or the post Commander orDeputy Commander concerning such a serious allegation against a senior officerandformer member of the Presidio headquarters, Adams-Thompson went immediately tothe FBI and the San Francisco Police Department. Thus, in addition to havingeveryreason to know his accusation was false to begin with, he also made it in a waywhichwould obviously result in the maximum damage to my wife and myself, and avoidedany consultative action within his chain of command which might haveshortstoppedthat accusation. For these reasons I conclude that the elements of proof of aviolation ofArticle #133 - of Adams-Thompson’s making a knowingly false and maliciousofficialstatement - clearly exist in this case. Both he and I were officers on activeduty; theincident occurred on a U.S. Army installation, and its evident intent wasdeliberately todefame and harm myself and my wife.31. It is now appropriate to examine the detailed story which Adams-Thompsonsayshe received from his stepdaughter either directly or via the therapist. At facevalue thestory was clearly concocted by an adult, not the child. It is impossible for a3-year-oldinfant to have assembled, much less recalled from a year earlier at age 2, astory withsuch features as the identification of a movie camera [as distinct from a stillcamera]and other details which no 2-year-old would either notice, recognize, or retain.Thestory is genital-obsessive to a disgusting degree: certainly the product of anadultperversion rather than a 2-year-old’s actual perception. The story was quiteobviouslyfabricated by an adult and tutored into the child -either by Adams-Thompsonhimself,the therapist, or by some other adult who had instructed her. [The details oftheAdams-Thompson account will all be found in the chart of “similar tales” onpages#21-22 of Attachment #A.]32. When Adams-Thompson made his allegations to FBI agent Clyde Foreman, thefirst thing Foreman should have done was to ask for medical verification thathisstepdaughter had in fact been double-raped and sodomized. When such a medicalreport could not be produced, Foreman should have asked for the child to betakenimmediately to LAMC for such a physical examination. There is no evidence that- 289 -Foreman did this. The absence of medical evidence that the child had been rapedorsodomized, therefore, was merely ignored by both the Adams-Thompsons andForeman.33. After Adams-Thompson made his allegations to Foreman, Foreman then drovethe child to my San Francisco street address, in the company of Michele Adams-Thompson. Allegedly the child then identified my building as the “home of GaryHambright”. This too is impossible, as the child had never been inside thebuilding [norhas any other member of the Adams-Thompson family - nor Gary Hambright (whomwe have never met) - nor any other child involved with the Presidio daycarecenter]. Ifshe identified the building, it is either because she was taken there in advanceandinstructed to “identify” the building later to the FBI agent, or because the“identification” was deliberately coached from her either by Adams-Thompson orbythe FBI agent. It would have been easy to do this simply by calling the child’sspecialattention to my building, just as AdamsThompson had done to me in the PX. BothAdams-Thompson and the FBI agent knew that my building was not the residence ofHambright, furthermore, because Hambright’s actual address elsewhere in SanFrancisco is included on the SFPD incident report (Attachment #E).34. Although the original story was that the child was taken to Gary Hambright’shouse, there is no evidence that the FBI agent or any other investigatingofficial everdrove the child to Gary Hambright’s block or address for a possible“identification” ofthe building where she was supposedly molested. Presumably this should havehappened in February 1987 after the therapist produced the molestation story. Ifsuchan on-site identification had been tried and failed, then it would have shownthe storyto be that much more spurious. If it had been tried and yielded an“identification”,there would then have been no reason to seek an “identification” of a totallydifferentbuilding halfway across the city. The inescapable conclusion is that no buildingidentification of Hambright’s residence was ever attempted as a consequence oftheoriginal story. Obviously the story had not been considered worth investigatingeven tothat extent - until Adams-Thompson saw my wife and myself in the PX and decidedtouse it for a deliberate attack against us. Suddenly an identification wasattemptedagainst my home supposedly on the grounds of the same story.35. For that matter, there is no evidence that during or following the therapy-produced story in February 1987 either the FBI or the SFPD ever acted to searchGaryHambright’s house, confiscate any items of his kept there (for example, a stillor moviecamera if he owned such an item), or otherwise take the Adams-Thompson storyseriously prior to its employment against my wife and myself.36. Since only Michele Adams-Thompson and FBI agent Clyde Foreman werepresent for the “building identification”, whatever leading questions orcoachingmethods were used on the child cannot be determined from the facts known.- 290 -Presumably neither would now admit to having deliberately coached anidentification.However it is obvious from the behavior of the Adams-Thompsons prior andsubsequent to this moment that they had deliberately set out to defame anddamage mywife and myself. A coached “building identification” would have represented onlyaminor obstacle.37. As a consequence of Adams-Thompson’s accusations, San Francisco PoliceDepartment Juvenile Division officer Glenn Pamfiloff then obtained and exercisedasearch warrant on my home on 14 August 1987 - from 9 PM to 1 AM, to the uttersurprise and shock of my wife and myself, who could do nothing but watch whileourentire flat was ransacked and our most personal effects pawed through andphotographed. The police found that the interior “descriptions” alleged to havebeengiven by the Adams-Thompson child did not match the interior of my home, andtheyfound no evidence whatever of any child-abuse/pornography activities. Theyconfiscated a selection of family and church papers & photographs, and otherarticlesso that, in my attorney’s opinion, they would not have to return to the judgewhoapproved the search-warrant empty-handed.38. Since it is SFPD policy to not return seized property until a judge ordersit, I hadto initiate litigation accordingly. In January 1988, after a motion to returnthe propertyhad been filed in San Francisco Municipal Court, Pamfiloff returned almost allof it.That same month he, my attorney, my wife, and I jointly inventoried the rest ofit andestablished that none of it was evidence either of the Adams-Thompsonallegations orof anything else illegal. [I have filed a formal complaint concerningPamfiloff’s actionsin this case with the Office of Citizen Complaints, San Francisco PoliceCommission.This complaint is under active investigation at this time.]39. On 1 August 1988 the San Francisco District Attorney’s office announced thatitwas closing its investigation into the Presidio scandal, and that no chargeswould befiled against my wife or myself.40. After the raid on my home, I did not learn of Adams-Thompson’s allegationsuntil 28 August 1987, when a copy of the SFPD Incident Report was finally madeavailable. As Adams-Thompson was at that time still assigned to the Presidio, Iimmediately contacted the Deputy Commander of the Presidio, Colonel D. PeterGleichenhaus. My wife and I met with him in his office on that morning.Gleichenhausindicated that he had never been contacted by Adams-Thompson about the matter,either before or after Adams-Thompson had contacted the FBI and SFPD. He saidthatAdams-Thompson was being transferred to the 25th Division in Hawaii, but as farashe knew was still in quarters at the Presidio.- 291 -41. The moment I left Gleichenhaus’ office I posted from the Presidio branchpostoffice a letter (Attachment #H) affirming my non-involvement and demanding aletterof apology and retraction for his conduct. He did not bother to reply.42. I thus conclude not only that an Army officer and chaplain made a maliciousandknowingly false criminal accusation against another officer and his wife, butalso that,when the facts were subsequently brought to his attention and an informalapologyrequested, his response was one of unconcern. Judging from his wife’s statementinparagraph #43 below, his only regret is that his maneuver didn’t succeed indoing moredamage to us than it did.43. On 2 August 1988, after the majority of the above-cited facts had long sincebeenestablished and the innocence of my wife and myself was clearly evident, andafter wehad endured a year of agony because of the allegations, Michele Adams-Thompsonhadonly this to say [quoted in the San Jose Mercury News]: “The district attorney’sdecision not to file charges is certainly not surprising in lieu (sic) of howthe authoritieshave bungled everything else. No one agency has distinguished themselves (sic).It allseemed to be a really sad failure of all agencies to do their jobs properly.”44. Therefore the unconcern of the Adams-Thompsons for all factual evidenceremains clear. That the various government agencies involved ultimately failedtosupport them doesn’t in the least change their minds; rather they merely attackthoseagencies en masse as inept and irresponsible.45. Michele Adams-Thompson also stated to the SJMN that she has kept her childinconstant therapy. Since there is no medical evidence that the child was everabused, theonly reason for such treatment would be to reinforce the story introduced as aconsequence of the February 1987 therapy sessions. If the child were tobacktrack tothe original statement of “no molestation” originally given to the FBI inJanuary 1987,obviously, it would be very inconvenient and awkward for Captain and Mrs. Adams-Thompson.46. The question of motive remains. Why should Lawrence Adams-Thompson havebehaved this way towards my wife and myself, since we had had no previouscontactwith him or his family whatever?47. During my assignment to the Presidio garrison, it was well-known on postthat Iwas, as High Priest of the Temple of Set, the chief official of the nation’slargest andmost prominent legitimate Satanic church. Although I did not advertise orencouragepublicity within the military in any way, my unusual religion was commonknowledgeto the post commanders under whom I served, the Presidio Catholic (ColonelChristoph) and Protestant (Colonel Autry) chaplains, and most if not all of theother- 292 -officers, enlisted personnel, and civilians on post. As one of the subordinategarrisonchaplains, it is inconceivable that Adams-Thompson was not also aware of it.48. At no time did Adams-Thompson speak to me about it, nor make any otherinquiry to the Temple of Set about its standing, beliefs, or practices. Had hedone so, hewould have learned that since its founding in 1975 it has remained a legitimatereligious institution, incorporated in California and possessing full state andfederaltax-exempt recognition as a church. It has no record whatever of any misdemeanororfelony activities. Its public information documents make it quite explicit thatit neitherengages in nor advocates any illegal activities whatever, nor permits anyoneunder theage of 18 to affiliate or to attend any of its functions. [My religiousaffiliation has beencontinuously known to the Army since my commissioning in 1968, and has neverbeenthe basis for any adverse official concern or action.]49. I find it inescapable to conclude, therefore, that Adams-Thompson’s actionstowards my wife and myself were the result of religious intolerance and bigotry:thefear and hatred of a passionate, professional Christian clergyman for somethingwhichhe [ignorantly] considered a threat to his preferred religion. Hence his actionswere notmotivated by a sincere, logical conviction on his part that my wife and I had infactmolested his stepdaughter, but rather by his cold and deliberate perception ofanopportunity to inflict great harm upon us and our church with a devastatingaccusation.50. In San Francisco Chronicle coverage of the Presidio child-care scandal on 10August 1987, it was established that the parents making the allegations werevery muchaware of the extremely sensational McMartin and Kern County “Satanicchild-abuse”cases of the previous two years, in which young children -proved later to havebeencoached to make false statements by parents, therapists, and law-enforcementofficials-obediently reported sexual abuse, murder, and cannibalism at the hands of“Sataniccults” at day-care centers. After exhaustive investigation and the ruining ofthe lives ofmany innocent persons who had neither abused children nor been Satanists(legitimateor otherwise), both scandals ended with the allegations of “Satanic child abuse”beingshown to be completely without basis. The Kern County case in particular endedwiththe California Attorney General severely criticizing the investigators andofficialsinvolved for the impulsive and unprofessional way in which they had proceeded.[SeeAttachment #B, documents A and H.]51. The publicity accorded these two cases - and a flurry of subsequent“copycat”cases around the country - have nonetheless generated a media image of Satanistsashabitual child-abusers or child-murderers. As law-enforcement officials haverepeatedly admitted, however, not a single such connection between child-abuse and Satanism has ever been established. The published texts ofcontemporary legitimate Satanism, most prominently Anton LaVey’s Satanic Bibleandthe Temple of Set’s Crystal Tablet of Set, contain strong and explicitprohibitions- 293 -against any and all harm to children, sexual or otherwise. [See Attachment #1.]See alsothe exposure and discrediting of the “Satanic” theme in Attachment #A, pages17-3152. I therefore conclude that Adams-Thompson deliberately intended to smear mygood name, that of my wife, and that of our church with this abominableaccusation,counting on media sensationalism and public ignorance not only to compound thedamage to us, but also to shield him from the consequences of falsely andmaliciouslyaccusing a fellow Army officer of a serious felony. To date it appears that hehas beenquite successful in this.53. After these charges were initially preferred on 4 January 1988, they werereferred to Adams-Thompson’s brigade commander for a preliminary inquiry. Afterfive months, during which time neither my wife nor myself was contacted by anyinvestigating authority to discuss our sworn statements, any statements byAdams-Thompson, or any other pertinent evidence, I received a letter saying merelythat thecharges had been dismissed “for lack of substantiating evidence”.54. As is clear from this sworn statement and its 4 January 1988 predecessor,thereis abundant substantiating evidence of the charges. It is not the function of apreliminary inquiry to pass preemptory judgment upon charges. The right ofjudgmentis reserved to a formally constituted court-martial. It is the right of onesoldier whobelieves he has been victimized by another in violation of Article #133 of theUniformCode of Military Justice to seek justice according to the procedures providedfor in thatcode.55. My family and I have now endured one year of protracted agony because ofAdams-Thompson’s vile accusation. We have been questioned by scores of militaryassociates, family friends, and business associates. We and our church have beencaricatured sensationally and inaccurately by many commercial media. Ourpersonalprivacy and the religious privacy of our church have been and continue to beregularlyviolated as though we are mere freaks for public entertainment; we are forced torespond to continued inquiries only to try to preclude at least the more bizarredistortions in the inevitable coverage. We have learned to our distress thateven themost polite declining of interviews usually results in hostile distortions bythe reportersin question.56. My wife and I have received several death and arson threats on our telephoneanswering machine. During one such message on January 1, 1988 an anonymouscallerstated that we would both be killed this year. Our San Francisco home has beenvandalized, forcing me to spend over $3,000 in repairs and protectivereinforcement.Our tenants in the building have also been harassed and traumatized byvandalism.- 294 -57. After a lifetime of cordial relations with the San Francisco PoliceDepartment, Ihad to initiate first legal actions and then a Police Commission complaintconcerningthe search/confiscation action they took solely on the strength ofAdams-Thompson’saccusations. The legal actions have already cost over $40,000 in attorney’s feesalone.58. Add to this the countless man-hours the Department of the Army has now hadtodevote to responding to reporters concerning this affair, and the damage to theArmythat has nonetheless resulted from some reporters’ crude castigations of theArmy formy religious “oddity” as though it were something despicable. Even my Top Secretsecurity clearance, though not compromised in the least by my religion nor evenrelevant to this situation, has been headlined as though it were a scandal initself. Andadd to this the very notion that a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army “may be linkedtochild-molesting at the Presidio” [as the stories “carefully” state], whichnecessarilyreflects that much more adversely upon the Army officer corps as a whole.59. I therefore request that the Commanding General of the 25th InfantryDivisionimmediately reactivate the charges I have preferred against Chaplain (Captain)Lawrence Adams-Thompson and refer them for trial by general court-martial.60. I fully appreciate the public relations awkwardness of a situation in whichtheUnited States Army court-martials a Christian chaplain in defense of a SatanistHighPriest. Certainly this is an unwelcome prospect in a country in which themajority ofthe citizenry are Christian. However I must point out that 14th Amendment to theUnited States Constitution, the supreme law of the land, guarantees equalprotection ofthe laws to all citizens regardless of their religion, and the 1st Amendment totheConstitution further guarantees freedom of all law-abiding religions andchurches inthis nation. I must also point out that Article #133 of the UCMJ specificallyappliessince both Adams-Thompson and myself were and are active-duty commissionedofficers covered by the Code. Any false or malicious action or statement that hemadeconcerning me, regardless when or to whom made, is covered by the Code. FinallyImust point out that whatever distaste the Army or the Corps of Chaplains feelsfor thissituation is not the result of any initiative by my religion, my wife, ormyself. I haveconducted myself as an officer and a gentleman, respecting soldiers of allfaiths, sincemy commissioning in 1968. It is Captain Lawrence Adams-Thompson who has forcedthis situation into existence, by deliberately and without the slightestprovocationacting to harm my wife and myself. I seek justice under the law, as isguaranteed toevery American citizen, and under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as isguaranteed to every American soldier.AffidavitI, Lieutenant Colonel Michael A.

Do you feel that AQUINO is trying to threatenyou, so that you will have your step-daughter retract her statements?A: Yes.Q: Explain how you feel that you have been threatened by AQUINO?A: I have received two letters from AQUINO. Copies of those letters are inpossessionof the CID Office, Presidio of San Francisco, CA and the CID Office, Hawaii.Also Ihave seen a copy of a newsletter which I believe was prepared by AQUINO, inwhichAQUINO had written an article concerning how he was being persecuted and that I- 299 -(he mentioned me by name in the article) was going to get my “just dues ... justreward ... or he’ll get his ...”, or something to that effect. 173Q: Did you feel that the comments made in the letters, and newsletter werethreatening?A: Yes, and that the charge sheet was another way of threatening me.Q: Has AQUINO ever made a direct threat against either you, or a member of yourfamily?A: Other then the statements made in the letters and newsletter, AQUINO hasneververbally threatened me, nor any member of my family.Q: Where is the copy of the newsletter?A: I have a copy of the newsletter and the CID Office in CA has a copy of thenewsletter.Q: Did you respond to either of the letters that AQUINO sent you?A: No.Q: Do you feel that AQUINO has the means to carry out the threats outlined inhisletters to you?A: Yes, when I read what he had written I believed at that time that he wouldcarry outhis threats.Q: Did you receive the letters from AQUINO, in which he threatened you, throughtheU.S. Mail?A: Yes.Q: Is there anything that you want to add to this statement?A: No.173 In the October 1987 issue of the Scroll of Set, newsletter of the Temple ofSet, I wrote:“What about Army Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson, blissfully enjoying his newassignmentin Hawaii after setting in motion this malicious damage to the Temple of Set,Lilith, and myself?“I have requested the Presidio Commander to initiate a formal reprimand as apermanent entry inAdams-Thompson’s official file - this again as a way of addressing the matterwithout the time,publicity, and expense that would accompany formal court-martial charges.

Such aviolation focuses on his irresponsibility for making a formal accusationconcerning my wife andmyself to the FBI when reasonable care on his part would have made it clear thatsuch an accusationwas unjustified. This is assuming that he did not deliberately fabricate hisstepdaughter’s detailedallegations, which in light of her 2-year-old age at the time I consider farmore probable. Also relevantis his profession as a Christian clergyman; I certainly doubt that he would havemade such anoutrageous accusation against any Lieutenant Colonel who was not known to be aprominentSatanist.“As of this writing, the Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) has opened apreliminaryinvestigation concerning Adams-Thompson.

OtstottCommanding General25th Infantry DivisionSchofield Barracks, HI 96857-6000Dear General Otstott:Enclosed is a DD Form 458 in which, on November 29, 1989, I have preferredcharges against Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson, an officer under yourcommand, for violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice as indicated.As you know, I originally preferred charges against this individual on January4,1988. Those charges were inquired into by Colonel Michael J. Sierra, Adams-Thompson’s brigade commander, in accordance with Rule #303 MCM.Colonel Sierra’s conclusions concerning Specification #1 of those charges werebasedupon a report of investigation provided to him by the CID, stating that “therewas a lackof substantiating evidence”, which he included as Tab A to his recommendationstoyour predecessor Major General Crysel.As has since been revealed, as verified by documents which I have sent to yousubsequently and together with this letter and charge sheet, the San FranciscoFieldOffice of the CID was in fact in possession of a considerable body of evidencetosubstantiate Specification #1. Hence the CID’s report of investigation toColonel Sierracaused him to be deliberately misled. This action by the San Francisco FieldOffice ofthe CID constitutes misprision of serious offense and obstruction of justice inviolationof Article 134 UCMJ, which I have brought to the attention of the CIC CommandingGeneral, Major General Cromartie, for investigation.Since the dismissal of those original charges, the CID has gone to extraordinaryandillegal lengths to prevent my seeing the CID report of investigation provided toColonelSierra, even to the extent of the Staff Judge Advocate of General Cromartie’sheadquarters stating to me on 10/20/89 that “no such report exists”. The CrimeRecords Center, after illegally denying me a copy of the “nonexistent” reportfor wellover a year, finally complied with the law and sent it to me three days ago.- 302 -What that CID investigation report reveals is that the “investigation” consistedofthe Hawaii Field Office of the CID simply referring the entire matter to the SanFrancisco Field Office. The San Francisco Field Office conducted noinvestigation atall, but simply called a Captain Boomer at the Presidio Judge Advocate’s office,whogave it as his “opinion” that “no evidence exists”.It is obvious that, in offering this “opinion”, Captain Boomer neitherresearched anyof the contents in the sworn statements & supporting documentation provided byMrs.Aquino and myself, nor had knowledge of FBI & CID documents known to the SanFrancisco Field Office of the CID which fully substantiated Specification #1. Asforthe San Francisco Field Office, it merely passed Boomer’s “opinion” along to theHawaiiOffice, which rubber-stamped it as an “Agent’s Investigation Report” on 4/14/88andpassed it along to Colonel Sierra.Perhaps most incredibly, the same Hawaii Field Office Special Agent (Facundo)conducted an interview with Adams-Thompson on 2/25/88 in which the only subjectthat was discussed was whether Adams-Thompson (whom Facundo identified as“victim”!) felt “threatened” by the fact that UCMJ charges had been preferredagainsthim. Not a single question material to the charges was asked by Facundo.Although Colonel Sierra should not be faulted for the incompetence and UCMJviolations of the CID, it was his responsibility to examine the report ofinvestigationprovided him by the CID for thoroughness and pertinence to the charges.Obviously theROl did not address any of the details of Specification #1 at all, and just asobviouslyFacundo’s interview with Adams-Thompson didn’t address them either. Accordinglyitwas Sierra’s responsibility to refuse to accept the ROI and send the CID back todo theinvestigation correctly and thoroughly. Sierra did not do this.It also seems reasonable to me that a #303 inquiry officer should make anattemptto interview all parties to the charges himself. There is no record of SierrainterviewingAdams-Thompson. Certainly Sierra did not interview, or even contact either Mrs.Aquino or myself as the two individuals who had provided sworn statements insupportof the charges. [Nor did either the Hawaii or the San Francisco CID, nor didCaptainBoomer.]In short, a proper Rule #303 inquiry was not conducted into the charges. ThatRulespecifically requires the commander to:“... gather all reasonably available evidence bearing on guilt or innocence andanyevidence relating to aggravation, extenuation, or mitigation.” [R.C.M. #303]It is clear that a decision was made, either by the San Francisco Field Officeof theCID or by higher authority, that Adams-Thompson would be “automaticallyinnocent”- 303 -in disregard of the facts. That meant that Mrs. Aquino and I had to be framed as“automatically guilty” in disregard of the same facts. As a consequence theSixth RegionHeadquarters of the CID, higher headquarters of the SFFO, has issued afraudulentreport titling us for the Adams-Thompson allegations and, of course, for making“false”sworn statements in support of the 1/4/88 UCMJ charges against Adams-Thompson.Ifour sworn statements - which were absolutely true in accordance with allinformation known to us at the time they were sworn - were not denounced, thentheacts wrongfully committed by the CID in Captain Sierra’s #303 inquiry would havebeen exposed, which in turn would have established the bias of the CID inissuing thefraudulent report against us.These actions by the San Francisco Field Office and Sixth Region CIDheadquarterswere also apparently in response to high-level political pressure that wouldmake it“out of the question” for a Christian chaplain to be prosecuted for crimescommittedagainst an officer and his wife who happen to be adherents of the Satanicreligion. Thisis in direct violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution’sprovision for equal protection of the laws.The instigation of the phony Presidio “child-molestation” scandal, the Adams-Thompsons’ decision to attack a Satanist family as part of it, and the zeal ofthe SFPDand CID in reinforcing this attack cannot be considered apart from the “Satanicchild-molestation” hate-propaganda promoted by religious extremists around thecountry.This campaign has since been exposed as utterly baseless, as the enclosed reportby theFBI’s senior expert on the subject indicates.Furthermore the officers in the SFPD responsible for prejudicing that agencyagainstour religion and ourselves, and for using Adams-Thompson’s allegations as thebasisfor persecution and harassment of us, have since been censured by the SanFranciscoPolice Commission for these actions (copy of SFPC letter of findings enclosed).I am advised by Captain Thomas Tinti of the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service,Presidio of San Francisco, that if a #303 inquiry has been improperly conducted,it isappropriate for the charges to be re-preferred and a correct #303 inquiryperformed.“A decision to take no action or dismissal of charges at this stage does not barlaterdisposition of the offenses under subsections (c)(2) through (5) of this rule.”[R.CM.306(c)(1)]I do not at this time take issue with Colonel Sierra’s recommendation thatSpecification #2 of the 1/4/88 charges be dismissed. Documentation laterprovided tome in response to my FOIA request to the 25th Division indicated that, despitethe factsstated in support of that original Specification #2 in my 1/4/88 swornstatement, it is- 304 -improbable that Adams-Thompson personally deposited the obscene card in questionin a San Francisco mailbox.In addition to repeating Specification #1 of the original charges, this presentChargeSheet adds a new Specification #2 based upon a further criminal act committed byAdams-Thompson in relation to Specification #1. This criminal act involves hisattemptto defraud the United States Government by capitalizing on the sheltering he hasreceived from the crimes he committed in Specification #1. Copies of the claimsformsin question are enclosed. Although the names of the claimants have beenconcealedfrom me, Major Harvey of the 6th Region CID informed my Army attorney CaptainHayes that they were in fact filed by the Adams-Thompsons. The new #303 inquiryofficer should, of course, obtain uncensored copies of these documents to verifythis.It is important to note that, in addition to the $750,000-$3,000,000 of whichAdams-Thompson is attempting to defraud the government, other instigators of thePresidio of San Francisco scam are also trying to defraud the government to atotal of$74,500,000. Cooperation by the 25th Division in the coverup of the truthconcerningAdams-Thompson’s crimes, in addition to being a UCMJ violation in itself, wouldfacilitate not only his defrauding of the government, but also - by lendingunwarrantedlegitimacy to the scam - facilitate the massive defrauding of the government bytheother instigators.The enclosures provided with this letter and Charge Sheet, many of which havepreviously been sent to you, represent only a portion of the officialdocumentation insubstantiation of these charges. The investigating officer should of courseobtainuncensored copies of all of these documents, as well as other documents whichmayexist in the files of the 6th Region CID, San Francisco Police Department, andFBIwhich further evidence Adams-Thompson’s criminal actions but which have beenconcealed to date.Please be advised that the conduct of the #303 inquiry into these charges by the25th Division will be closely observed, and if necessary brought to theattention ofappropriate senior commanders, the Department of the Army Inspector General, andother governmental and non-governmental officials and institutions concernedwiththe enforcement of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution andapplicable religious-freedom provisions of AR 600-20.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

Colonel Michael A. Aquino- initially prepared May 3, 1989 -- updated as of November 29, 1989 -A. Prior to August 1987.1. On 1/14/87, after the Presidio child-care witch-hunt had been in process fortwomonths, Chaplain Adams-Thompson and his wife Michele were interviewed by FBISpecial Agent Patricia J. Peyton (FBI #FD-302, 1/14/87). Adams-Thompson’sstepdaughter (Michele’s daughter) Kinsey Almond was apparently not present.From the transcript of the FBI report:a. “Mrs. Adams-Thompson advised that her daughter Kinsey had been attendingthe school [Presidio Child Development Center (CDC)] since spring 1986. Whenshe turned 3 in September, she was transferred to ‘Mr. Gary’s’ (GaryHambright) class.”b. “When Mrs. Adams-Thompson asked if Mr. Gary had been mean to her or triedto touch her, Kinsey replied negatively.”2. In this interview - only 2-1/2 months after the time-period in which Adams-Thompson would later allege so many different and dramatic sexual atrocitiesoccurred - the Adams-Thompsons stated Almond’s denial of any abuse. Theymade no mention of any emergency medical care of Almond, such as would havebeen necessary had she been abused as they would later allege. They made nomention of anyone other than Hambright at all, nor of any reason to think thatAlmond had been abducted from the day-care center at any time. They did notaccuse Hambright of anything.3. When the Sixth Region CID (6RCID) established that Mrs. Aquino and I had beenin Washington, D.C. on all dates in September-October 1986 on which Almond hadbeen at the Presidio day-care center, Adams-Thompson cooperated with the6RCID in “revising” the dates of his 8/87 allegation against us to the May-July86time period. Evidently he and Michele assumed that their statement to PeytonthatAlmond had never been under Hambright’s care or control until September 86- 307 -had either been lost or was just not noticed. [It has been found and is herebynoticed.]4. According to a 12/15/86 letter from Lt.Colonel Walter W. Myer, Director ofPersonnel and Community Activities, HQ Presidio, at no time during his entireemployment at the CDC did Gary Hambright supervise children under the age of 3.As Kinsey Almond did not turn 3 until 9/1/86, this further verifies thatHambrightcould not have had her under his care or control in May-July 86.5. This 1/14/87 FBI interview is both the closest to the September-October 1986time-period and the only one in which the Adams-Thompsons did not possessinformation concerning ourselves which they could manipulate to try to constructplausible lies. If any of the atrocities later invented by Adams-Thompson weretrue,it is obvious that specific medical signs of them would have appeared at thetime of the incident and would been documented in this most immediateinterview accordingly.6. On 3/12/87 Kinsey Almond was medically examined. The findings of this medicalexamination stated specifically that there was “no physical evidence of abuse”.7. Nevertheless, not later than April 1987 Adams-Thompson made an allegationagainst Gary Hambright for sexually abusing Almond. “Such act or acts took placesometime in September or October 1986 at the Child Development Center, Presidioof San Francisco.” [Letter, Presidio CDS Director to Hambright, 4/17/87]. Adams-Thompson was specific about the time and location, and no allegation was made ofthe child being transported elsewhere, of anyone else being involved, or of anyother time period being involved.8. In the 8/14/87 SFPD Incident Report Adams-Thompson states that, subsequent tothe Peyton interview, he entered Almond into therapy with Debbie Hickey, anArmy therapist who at the time was diagnosing multiple cases of child sex-abuse[including in her own children] despite physiological/medical evidence to thecontrary. He states that Hickey informed him that Almond had been molested.None of Hickey’s notes as revealed by the 6RCID to date, however, verify thatHickey ever made such an abuse-diagnosis to Adams-Thompson.9. Despite Adams-Thompson’s April 87 allegations, however, it is clear thatneitherthe FBI (investigating) nor the U.S. Attorney’s Office (prosecuting) Hambrightthought that any harm had come to Almond at all. Her name was not included ineither the initial or the superseding indictments which were brought againstHambright [and which were ultimately all dismissed by the court].- 308 -B. The August 1987 “Package Story”.10. In formal statements to the FBI and San Francisco Police in August 1987,Adams-Thompson suddenly changed his April 87 allegation entirely, now saying thatAlmond had been taken off the Presidio and that Mrs. Aquino and myself wereinvolved.11. During the course of its 1988-89 investigation, upon finding that neitherMrs.Aquino nor I were in the San Francisco area at any time during September-October1986 when Almond had been left at the Presidio day-care center, the 6RCIDarbitrarily changed the dates of the allegation back several months to a timewhen Iwas still assigned to the Presidio. Although Adams-Thompson’s April and Augustallegations had clearly specified the September-October 1986 time period, heremained silent and made no objection while the 6RCID “further adjusted” hisalready-repeatedly-changed allegations.12. In August 1987 Adams-Thompson made an allegation against Mrs. Aquino andmyself of rape and sodomy concerning Kinsey Almond, knowing all the time thatAlmond is a virgin and showed no signs of any physical damage such aswould have been immediately and conspicuously evident in the case of a 3-year-old, requiring immediate emergency medical treatment. [He of course was aware ofthe 3/12/87 medical examination of Almond which found that there were no signsof abuse whatever.]"},{"pageContent":"13. Although Adams-Thompson alleged that the rape/sodomy happened between 1September and 31 October 1986, there is no evidence that he ever noticedanything wrong with Almond, nor took her for an emergency medicalexamination of this nature at any point during that period [nor during thelater-invented May-July 86 period].14. Although two rapes and two sodomies, which Adams-Thompson alleges werecommitted by two adult males, would also have severely traumatized a 3-year-old,there is no published evidence that he ever noticed anything wrong with Almondnor took her for psychiatric help during September/October 1986 [nor during thelater-invented May-July 86 period].15. In August 1987 the Adams-Thompsons made a big issue about Almond’s being“upset” at seeing me in the Presidio PX, and “upset” in the vicinity of 123Acme. Ifthis same child was supposedly abducted and molested in September/October1986 [or during the 6RCID-invented May-July 1986 period], why wouldn’t shehave shown far more obvious signs of being “upset” at that time? Obviously the“evidence” of Almond’s being “upset” in August 1987 means nothing.- 309 -Adams-Thompson made repeated, official, and deliberately false allegations ofviolentand depraved crimes against his stepdaughter which, at the time he made theallegations, he knew had never taken place. He modified these allegationsseveraltimes in order to try to fit them to the known circumstances of whomever he wastrying to victimize at the moment (Hambright and/or Mrs. Aquino & myself).16. On August 13, after seeing my wife and myself at the Presidio post exchange,Adams-Thompson and Michele contacted FBI Special Agent Clyde Foreman, theagent in charge of the general Presidio investigation since it was originallyincited.In Foreman’s report of this contact (FBI #FD-302 8/13/87), the Adams-Thompsons offer a substantially different story of the “PX encounter” than theywould give to SFPD Inspector Pamfiloff the following day, and a substantiallydifferent story than they would give to the 6RCID in 1989. Specificdiscrepanciesare indicated below, in a discussion of the “package story” which Adams-Thompson offered to Pamfiloff.17. On August 14 Adams-Thompson made a statement to SFPD Inspector Pamfiloff. Inthis statement the “package story”, which Adams-Thompson invented in itsentirety solely to harm Mrs. Aquino and myself and to slander our religion,appearsfor the first time.18. In the SFPD Incident Report, Adams-Thompson stated to Inspector Pamfiloffthat“in January of 1987 he became aware of a child molest investigation involvingGaryHambright at the Presidio day-care center”. In fact that investigation commencedtwo months earlier, in November 1986, and Adams-Thompson was aware of itfrom the beginning.19. The first official notification of the investigation to Presidio parents wasa letterfrom Lt.Colonel Walter Meyer, 12/15/86. However, in the San Jose Mercury NewsWest, it was later reported that the initial accusation of molestation at thePresidiocame about after the parents (the Tobins) had asked the advice of a chaplain atthePresidio. This was in November 1986. As the Adams-Thompsons’ signaturesappear immediately after the Tobins’ in an inflammatory letter sent to Presidioparents in early 1987 to fuel the fires of the witch-hunt, it is probable thatAdams-Thompson was indeed the chaplain who set the hysteria in motion in November.Adams-Thompson lied to Pamfiloff about the time he became aware of the Presidiochild-care scandal, presumably to conceal or excuse the fact that he had notmade anycomplaints concerning his stepdaughter during the September-October 1986 timeperiod. He said nothing to Pamfiloff about his and Michele’s key activities inpromotion of the hysteria. He lied to Pamfiloff about Almond’s denial of abuseat thetime of the Peyton FBI interview, saying instead that Almond had “made nodefinitivestatements” at the time.- 310 -20. In the SFPD Incident Report, Adams-Thompson stated to Inspector PamfiloffthatKinsey Almond “was subsequently entered into child therapy in February 1987 andafter four visits the therapist informed Adams-Thompson that Almond haddisclosed being molested. During the next few visits Almond told Adams-Thompson that she had been molested by Gary Hambright and a ‘Mikey’ and a‘Shamby’ whose identities were unknown”. The notes of Debbie Hickey as madeavailable to date do not substantiate that Almond told either Adams-Thompson orHickey that she had been molested during any of these sessions, or that she toldhim that “Mikey” and/or “Shamby” had done anything, or that she even associated“Mikey” and “Shamby” as a couple.21. In her 4/10/89 statement to the CID, Michele Adams-Thompson states that itwasnot Almond who introduced the subject of “Satanism” into the therapy sessions,but Debbie Hickey, who had provided Michele with an article which Hickey hadhighlighted entitled “The Devil Made Me Do It”. Commencing with the 6/2/89therapy session, Michele states that she brought up the subject again withHickey.22. In his 4/10/89 statement to the CID, Lawrence Adams-Thompson admits that herecognized me from the time I had still been assigned to the PresidioHeadquarters, and also that he knew at that time that I was a member of theTemple of Set.This information establishes that prior to any attempt to turn “Mikey” into aSatanistand an Army officer in the therapy sessions, both Lawrence and Michele Adams-Thompson were aware of me and my religion. It also establishes that DebbieHickeywas circulating “Satanic child molestation” propaganda to the parents of thechildrenwhom she was “therapizing”.23. In the 8/13/87 FBI report, Michele Adams-Thompson “recalled on prioroccasionsKinsey had described Mikey as a man who wore an Army suit ‘like Daddy’s’ andthat he had eyebrows that went up. Kinsey also called Mikey ‘the blood man’.”24. In the Hickey notes, however, Almond never describes “Mikey” as “wearing anArmy suit like Daddy’s”; it is again Michele who alleges this to Hickey(6/30/87) -a month after Michele’s 6/2/87 introduction of “Satanic child molestation” intotheHickey sessions - when it had evidently occurred to the Adams-Thompsons thatMrs. Aquino and I, as the Presidio’s famous Satanists, might be suitable victimsforallegations in addition to or in lieu of Hambright. In the Hickey notes neitherMichele nor Almond makes any mention of “eyebrows that went up”, nor of “theblood man”, nor of association of blood with “Mikey” in any way. Micheleconveniently “forgot” to mention to Foreman that, in the Hickey sessions, Almondhad picked out a Chief Warrant Officer 2 rank insignia as being that which“Mikey”- 311 -supposedly wore, and had told Hickey that the letters “AK” appeared on hisnametag.This is just one of many instances of Michele Adams-Thompson “recalling” thingsin atransparent attempt to fabricate a bogus “identification”. Obviously Michele hadseenmy distinctive eyebrows the previous day in the PX. Chaplain Adams-Thompson,present at this interview, did not intervene to correct her inventions, nor tosupply theinformation which she conveniently “forgot”. In general, the Adams-Thompsonsseemto be equally accomplished at “forgetting” inconvenient facts and at“remembering”convenient “associations” after being exposed to new information.25. Prior to the Adams-Thompsons’ invention of the “package story” and tutoringof itto her, in fact, there is no published record of Kinsey Almond ever stating toanyone that she was ever sexually attacked, raped, or sodomized by anyoneanywhere. There is only the sudden appearance of the “package story” as recitedby Almond to Foreman on 8/13/87 and dramatically elaborated upon by LawrenceAdams-Thompson to Pamfiloff on 8/14/87. The only time that such a story fromAlmond herself would have been untainted, of course, would have beenimmediately at the time of the incident in question. No such statement oranything remotely resembling it was ever made. The first official interview,by the FBI Agent Peyton in January 1987, elicited no such statement from Almond[or her mother or stepfather]. Even in April 1989, after her mother andstepfatherhad had years to drill her, her attempted recitation of her stepfather’s“packagestory” to 6RCID interviewers was a ludicrous fiasco (CID report 8/11/89, para.4.1).26. There is no published record that Hickey diagnosed Almond as having beensexually abused by anyone anywhere. There are, in the Hickey notes, onlyincoherent ramblings of the sort common to all children of this age,cross-fertilizedwith the same pseudo-“Satanic ritual” nonsense popularized for such scams asthatat the Presidio by the book Michelle Remembers and the McMartin fiasco in LosAngeles, and as introduced into the “therapy” by Hickey and Michele themselves(CID statement, Michele Adams-Thompson, 4/10/89).27. Although on 8/14/87 Adams-Thompson told Pamfiloff the extremely elaborate“package story” of what was supposed to have happened to Almond during her“abduction”, not a single element of this “package story” appears in Michele’sinterview with Foreman only 24 hours earlier.Adams-Thompson lied when he told Pamfiloff that Almond had told him the “packagestory”. He told Pamfiloff nothing about the incoherent ramblings of Almondduringthe Hickey sessions, nor of Almond’s mentioning five other individuals, nor thatAlmond had not associated “Mikey” and “Shamby” together during the sessions, northat Almond had never accused anyone of molesting her during the sessions.- 312 -28. In the “package story” of Almond’s “abduction” which Adams-Thompson told toPamfiloff, he stated that Almond said that “she drove with Mr. Gary to hishouse”.29. In her 8/13/87 statement to Foreman, Michele alleged only that Almond hadreferred to “Mr. Gary’s house”. She made no mention of Hambright “driving”Almond there or anywhere else.30. In an FBI Form FD-302 dated 8/13/87 (which has been concealed from me butdescribed to my attorney Captain Hayes), Almond purportedly said that shetraveled “with Mr. Gary in a green car to his home”. She did not mention anyoneelse in the car, nor going to any other location.31. As verified by the U.S. Public Defender’s Office in San Francisco, GaryHambrightis an epileptic who cannot drive, having neither driver’s license nor car.Adams-Thompson had to come up with a way to “transport” Almond from the day-care center to our building. [In all “day-care sex-abuse” scams, “off-sitetransport” isthe ploy commonly used to “explain” abuse which could not possibly happen in theobservable environment of a day-care center itself.] He knew that there was noindication that anyone like Mrs. Aquino or myself had ever been to the center.Therefore he would have to portray the teacher, Hambright, driving Almond away.He either did not know that Hambright cannot drive and owns no vehicle, or hesimply forgot this fact while inventing the “package story” at short notice. Norhas heexplained how the red Isuzu, if it were supposedly “our” car inSeptember-October1986 (which it was not), would have driven itself to the CDC, changing its colortogreen on the way, to be available for Hambright’s use if Mrs. Aquino and I werebothat home at the time. Later the Adams-Thompsons tried to get around this problem,and presumably Hambright’s driving incapacity, by proposing that Mrs. Aquinodrove Hambright and Almond in “Shamby’s” car, which had once again changed itscolor to red.32. Adams-Thompson told Pamfiloff a “package story” which he claims Almond toldtoFBI Agent Clyde Foreman on the previous day (13 August 1987). At that timeAdams-Thompson knew full well that this package story was nothing more than aselective rearrangement of garbled nonsense that Almond [and Michele] had toldDebbie Hickey. Adams-Thompson did not make this clarification to eitherForeman or Pamfiloff. This would have been crucial to the credibility of thechild’sstory.33. Not a single element of this “package story” appears in Michele’s 8/13/87statement to Foreman.- 313 -34. In an FBI Form FD-302 dated 8/13/87 (which has been concealed from me butdescribed to my attorney Captain Hayes), Almond purportedly said that Mr. Garydrove her to his home, which had a bathtub with lion’s feet, that Mikey woreArmyclothes, and that she was raped and sodomized by both Mr. Gary and Mikey. Sheapparently made no mention of any of the other features of Adams-Thompson’s“package story”.Adams-Thompson deliberately omitted mention of the actual, disconnected natureofAlmond’s therapy ramblings in order to convince Foreman and Pamfiloff that shewas telling a coherent story of abduction, sodomy, and rape. He did this toinciteForeman and Pamfiloff to action against my wife and myself. The “package story”was obviously invented by Adams-Thompson and Michele following the encounter atthe PX, recited in part by Almond to Foreman on 8/13/87, and elaborated upon byAdams-Thompson for Pamfiloff the next morning (8/14/87).If Almond herself made the statements as cited from the FBI FD-302 8/13/87, thenitis easily refutable. Hambright cannot drive and had no car. 123 Acme is not hishome.123 Acme contains no bathtub with lion’s feet. It is insane to think that, if Iwere goingto commit such crimes as these, I would do so in full Army uniform, at my ownhome,and using anything resembling my own name. Finally Almond has been medicallyexamined and found to be a virgin with no signs of rape or sodomy.35. Adams-Thompson arbitrarily added details to the “package story” which do notappear in the Hickey notes, such as a movie camera and “a living room with blackwalls and a cross painted on the ceiling”. If Almond mentioned these features toForeman herself prior to Adams-Thompson’s relaying this account to Pamfiloff,then Adams-Thompson obviously coached it into her following the Hickeysessions, to add a “Satanic/film-pornographic” touch to the planned “packagestory”.36. None of these details appears in Michele’s 8/13/87 statement to Foreman, orin thepurported 8/13/87 statement of Almond to Foreman.In addition to allowing law-enforcement officials to think that his stepdaughterhadtold a coherent “package story”, Adams-Thompson added details to that storyhimselfto make it more horrendous than merely a rearrangement of the Hickey notes wouldsupport.C. The August 12, 1987 Presidio Post Exchange Incident.The next section of this summary concerns the “PX incident” of 8/12/87, in whichLawrence and Michele Adams-Thompson alleged that Kinsey Almond “identified”Mrs. Aquino and myself. The follow analysis examines the changes and- 314 -inconsistencies in Lawrence and Michele’s accounts in detail. It is important tonote,however, that at the time of their original attack in August 1987, there isonly the word of the two adult Adams-Thompsons that this incident everhappened at all. All that is known for certain is that Lawrence and/or Michelesawus at the PX on that day.a. There is no evidence that Almond was with them.b. There is no evidence that Almond reacted to anyone as they alleged.c. There is no evidence that Almond “identified” anyone as they alleged.1-1/2 years later the Adams-Thompsons, apparently in a belated effort to prop uptheir story concerning the PX, suddenly added Lawrence’s two sons to the scene.Alsojust as suddenly these two boys echoed their father’s story to the CID. AyoungerAdams-Thompson daughter was added to the scene as well, doubling the originalnumber of Adams-Thompsons said to be at the PX on that day. It is just as easyforthe Adams-Thompsons to have invented the presence of Almond, and her behavior,inthe original stories they told Foreman and Pamfiloff. There is no contemporaryrecord of Kinsey Almond herself verifying either her presence at the PX orany of the statements or actions attributed to her there. Only 1-1/2 yearslater, in a ludicrously coached [and ineptly recited] interview with the 6RCIDdid shemake any reference to the PX, purportedly saying that she had recognized me butnotMrs. Aquino there.Following is a detailed discussion of the adult Adams-Thompsons’ PX allegations:37. On 8/14/87 Adams-Thompson told Pamfiloff that “on 12 August 1987 he, MicheleAdams-Thompson, and Kinsey Almond were at the Presidio PX.” No mention ismade of any other members of the Adams or Thompson family together with themat the PX.38. On 8/13/87 Michele stated to Foreman that only she, Almond, and her husbandwere shopping at the PX. No mention is made of any other members of the Adamsor Thompson family together with them at the PX.39. No mention was made of any other family members present throughout thesubsequent 1-1/2 years while the Aquinos were being investigated and the PXaccount described in detail in the public media. Only when the 6RCID interviewedAdams-Thompson 1–1/2 years later on 4/10/89 did he again revise his story to saythat two sons of his by a previous marriage and another girl (“our youngestdaughter”) were also there. Suddenly there are six Adams-Thompsons at the PXinstead of the original three.- 315 -Adams-Thompson lied to Pamfiloff, the FBI, and/or the 6RCID about the number ofmembers of his family present at the PX and their involvement. Since by April1989the Adams-Thompsons had had 1-1/2 years to consider ways of trying to strengthentheir allegations, the 1989 accounts must be considered spurious wherecontradictedby the 1987 ones.40. In the 8/14/87 SFPD incident report Adams-Thompson told Pamfiloff that, atthePX, Almond “ran to him and in a frightened way clutched his leg”.41. In the 8/13/87 FBI report Michele Adams-Thompson told Foreman that, at thePX,“Kinsey ran to her and Larry”. In her 4/10/89 CID statement, however, shecontradicts this, saying that Adams-Thompson called Michele over to him afterAlmond was already with him.42. On 4/10/89 Adams-Thompson told the 6RCID that Almond was with her twostepbrothers in the PX, away from him and his wife, and that it was the two boyswho brought Almond to him “saying Kinsey was acting weird”. He did not say thatAlmond “ran to him”. He also said that Michele was “in another area of thestore”and that he had to go to her in that area when Almond was brought to him[alone].Adams-Thompson lied when making one of his two mutually-contradictorystatements. Michele also lied when making one of her two mutually-contradictorystatements. [If in fact Almond did not “react” at all in the PX [or was not eventhere],as is also possible, then of course Adams-Thompson lied when making bothstatements.] Furthermore, where would Almond “run from”? Did the Adams-Thompsons allow a 3-year-old infant to wander around the PX away from them?How could Almond run “to [Michele] and Larry” when they were in different partsofthe store?43. The two boys (who in August 87 were approximately 9 and 13 years old),interviewed 1-1/2 years later by the 6RCID, state that Almond was with them andthat she reacted as alleged in the account Adams-Thompson gave to the 6RCID[but not to the FBI or SFPD].a. Why are the memories of two children at such ages suddenly so preciseconcerning what to them would have been only a momentary sulk by theirinfant stepsister 1-1/2 years previously?b. Why were these boys not mentioned by or interviewed by Foreman or Pamfiloffat the time? They are not listed on page #1 of the SFPD incident report. Theyare not mentioned in Foreman’s 8/13/87 report. [Foreman knew of theirexistence, however, as they were identified as relatives in Peyton’s 1/14/87report.] They would have been crucial witnesses to the “PX encounter”. And- 316 -why were they not mentioned by any of the news media in their intense anddetailed coverage of the allegations over the next 1-1/2 years?The boys’ story is obviously a later invention, coached into them by theirfather.Obviously the boys’ motivation in reciting this story is to try to keep theirfather fromfacing criminal prosecution for his actions in this affair - which of course hewouldhave represented to them as truthful and honorable. As young teenagers from afundamentalist-Christian family, it is not difficult to see them cooperatingwith theirfather in any “white lie” requested to attack “the Devil”. Nor need he have evenrepresented it to them as a “lie”. All he had to do was tell them what heinsistshappened, and make it clear that he expected them to back him up to the CID.44. On 8/14/87 Adams-Thompson told Pamfiloff that he called Almond’s attentiontome - not once, but twice - and asked her if she knew me before eliciting a “Yes,that’s Mikey” response.45. On 8/13/87 Michele told Foreman that Almond “told them that she had seen aman named ‘Mikey’ that she knew from Mr. Gary’s house”. [No prompting at all inthis version - and the sudden addition of “Mr. Gary’s house”].46. On 4/10/89 Adams-Thompson told the 6RCID that Almond twice made no answerin response to his twice-stated question: “Do you know that man?”. Then he toldthe 6RCID that Michele took Almond away from him and over to my vicinity forabout five minutes. Then he said that Michele came back and that they proceededto leave the PX. As they were doing so, he said “I heard Kinsey state ‘That’sMikey,he’s a bad man, get me out of this place’ or words to that effect.”Adams-Thompson gave one version of Kinsey’s alleged statement in the PX to theSFPD and another version to the CID. In both instances he admits to promptingAlmond repeatedly for an “identification”. Both of his stories contradict theaccountgiven by Michele to Foreman only 24 hours before his statement to the SFPD.47. On 8/14/87 Adams-Thompson told Pamfiloff only that Almond “saw” me.48. On 8/13/87 Adams-Thompson told Foreman that I “made eye contact withKinsey”. [I did not, and would not have recognized her if I had.]49. In her 8/13/87 statement to Foreman, Michele says nothing whatever aboutAlmond making eye contact with me.Adams-Thompson thus gave two contradictory accounts one day apart [andimmediately after the PX incident]. Furthermore, Adams-Thompson told the 6RCID1-1/2 years later that it was the two boys who were with Almond when she noticed- 317 -me. Adams-Thompson lied in the initial contradiction, and then again if he nowstatesthat Almond was with the two boys at the time.50. To Pamfiloff on 8/14/87 and to the CID on 4/10/89, Adams-Thompson said thathe and Kinsey saw only me in the PX, and that Mrs. Aquino did not appear untillater in the parking lot.51. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Michele Adams-Thompson said nothing about Mrs.Aquino being in the PX, and that her first appearance was “standing next to thecarin the parking lot”. Michele further said that she “followed Colonel Aquino tothecheckout stand” closely enough to observe my active-duty Army ID card and to seeme sign my full name on the MasterCard slip. As Mrs. Aquino was standing withme in the checkout line, it would have been quite impossible for Michele not toseeher if she were peering over my shoulder at the time.52. To the CID on 4/10/89 Michele Adams-Thompson said that Mrs. Aquino was inthe PX, that she observed us purchase the microwave together in the checkoutline,and that she watched us exit together through the PX mall area. [In thisinterviewshe tried to cover up for her earlier failure to mention Mrs. Aquino in the PXbyimplying that she didn’t recognize her as my wife. In Lawrence Adams-Thompson’s8/12/87 telephone call to the FBI, however, he said that he recognized Mrs.Aquinobecause she had been introduced at several [Presidio] functions. PresumablyMichele attended those same husband/wife “command performance” socialfunctions with her husband, so she had no excuse for not recognizing the womanwith me in the PX as that same Mrs. Aquino. [Mrs. Aquino possesses very strikingand unforgettable looks, I may add.]Mrs. Aquino was with me at all times in the PX; therefore Adams-Thompson’s1987/1989 and Michele’s 1987 statements that she didn’t appear until later intheparking lot are obvious lies - and among the most conspicuous lies in the Adams-Thompsons’ original allegations. In her 1989 statement to the CID, Michelecompletely contradicted her original 1987 statement to Foreman on this matter.53. To Pamfiloff Adams-Thompson said that he [alone] took Almond “outside totheircar”. He made no mention of taking the younger girl or the two boys out to thecar.Why would he take Almond outside to the car at all if she had already“identified”someone whom Adams-Thompson himself stated in the SFPD report that herecognized? As it was obvious that Mrs. Aquino and I were leaving the PX, and ifthe goal was to calm Almond, why suddenly rush all of the Adams-Thompsons outinto their car? Why would they not be accompanied by Almond’s mother, whowould presumably have been greatly concerned about her daughter? NeitherLawrence nor Michele explains this.- 318 -Obviously the Adams-Thompsons, who had already seen and recognized both Mrs.Aquino and myself in the PX, wanted to see what our car looked like so that itcould beadded to the allegations they had already planned to make against us. Once intheirown car, they may also have followed us to our home, so that they could try tocoachAlmond into “recognizing” that as well before an official audience. Theysucceededwith the car (which they didn’t know was only a rental car) and failed with thehouse.54. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Adams-Thompson said that he “went to the car to waitforus, and saw them, and took the license number”.55. To Pamfiloff on 8/14/87 Adams-Thompson said that he drove around to theotherside of the PX, where Kinsey supposedly identified Mrs. Aquino as “Shamby”. Inthis SFPD version there is no mention of our car or taking its license number.Adams Thompson changes his story at will, as in one case he needed to drive totheother lot to find us, while in the other he merely waits for us.56. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Michele said that “Michele, Larry, and Kinsey drovethrough the parking lot where they observed Colonel Aquino standing next to aredvehicle with California license plate 2ENS453. This vehicle was a 1987 Isuzu.Kinsey observed a woman standing next to the vehicle and said, ‘That’sShamby.’” [Note that in this account Michele identified herself, her husband,andAlmond by name but made no mention whatever of the two boys andadditional girl who were suddenly introduced into this story 1-1/2 years later.]57. In her 4/10/89 CID statement, Michele said that Mrs. Aquino was standingnext toour car “alone”.Michele changes her story at will concerning how many Aquinos were standing nextto the Isuzu.58. To the SFPD on 8/14/87 Adams-Thompson said that he drove around to the otherside of the PX. To Foreman on 8/13/87 Michele said that he drove through theparking lot to our car.In one version Adams-Thompson drives around to the other side of the PX, whileinthe other he merely waits for us, sees us, and takes down the license number ofourcar.If Almond had already seen Mrs. Aquino and myself in the PX, as Adams-Thompsonadmitted to the 6RCID on 4/10/89, why would Almond not have “identified” Mrs.Aquino until later at our car?- 319 -One cannot reach the bridge-approach parking lot by driving “through the mainlot”;it is necessary to drive out into the street and about 2 blocks to the east tocirclearound the complex, or about 2 blocks to the west to circle around it from theotherside.59. The PX has two parking lots, one on the north side of the mall and one onthe southside of the mall. From the Adams-Thompsons’ 4/10/89 CID statements, their carwas parked in the north lot. Our car was parked in the south lot. If the Adams-Thompsons drove around to the south lot from the north lot after seeing us gothrough the mall, and if Michele (per her 4/10/89 statement) didn’t even getintothe Adams-Thompson car until after we had walked through the mall doors to thesouth lot, they wouldn’t have had time to get there [for the alleged Almond“identification” of Lilith] before we drove away. It is approximately a 2-blocksup/2-blocks back drive between the two lots, no matter which direction you go.Adams-Thompson is lying about being able to “drive around to the other side ofthePX” for Almond to see Mrs. Aquino and for him to take down the license number ofour car. It takes so long to drive to the “bridge-approach” lot from the mainlot thatwe would have driven away before Adams-Thompson could get to that area, muchless single out our car from among the others there, much less identify usinside a car.As it was August and the car was air-conditioned, and we habitually drive withtheA/C on and all windows up, is Almond supposed to have “identified” Mrs. Aquinoat adistance, from inside a moving car, looking at a car suddenly pointed out toher, andat a person through rolled-up window glass? [Note: This car was a rental carwhichAdams-Thompson would never have seen before.] Probably the Adams-Thompsonssimply followed us on foot from the checkout counter through the mall doors toourrental car, then went to their own car [in either lot] and drove after us whenweemerged from the south lot.If Almond is supposed to have “identified” Mrs. Aquino at a moment’s notice, atadistance, from inside a moving car, looking at a car suddenly pointed out toher, andat a person through rolled-up window glass, then why did she not “identify”Mrs. Aquino in the PX, when she would have been able to look at her as long andas closely as she allegedly did at me? Mrs. Aquino was right next to me theentire timewe were in the PX. It would have been impossible for Almond [or the adult Adams-Thompsons] to see just me and not Mrs. Aquino.D. The 123 Acme Avenue “Identification” Trip.60. To Pamfiloff on 8/14/87 Adams-Thompson stated that on 8/13/87: “Michele andKinsey, accompanied by Foreman, responded to the 100 block of Acme, and Kinseywas told to see if she could recognize any of the houses that she had been tobefore.- 320 -While walking past 123 Acme, Kinsey identified that as the residence of Mr. Garywhere she had met ‘Mikey’ and ‘Shamby’.”61. The 8/13/87 record of this trip by CID Special Agent Bradley Potter revealsthatvirtually every element of Adams-Thompson’s statement to Pamfiloffconcerning it was a lie. [Quotes from this report as follows fill in theprobablenames that were blanked out from the copy of this report provided to me on11/27/89.]62. Adams-Thompson made no mention to Pamfiloff that CID Agent Potter also wentalong on the trip. This is significant in that Potter’s account of the tripcontradicts Adams-Thompson’s “package story” account of it.63. Potter acknowledges that “Almond did not direct SA Potter, who was driving,where to turn or which route to take. SA Potter drove the the (sic) vicinity ofthe100 block of Acme Avenue, San Francisco”.64. The 8/11/89 CID report states that “Kinsey was told that she would betraveling toan area where she should examine the houses to see if she recognized any of thehomes as a place where she had gone before.” As this guidance to her was givenimmediately after the same persons had led her through a recitation of Adams-Thompson’s “package story”, it is obvious that the child was meant to connectthetwo situations and produce the house from that story.65. The 8/11/89 CID report states that the adults drove Almond up and down the100block twice, each time eliciting no response from her whatever. Then,obviously determined that the child would do something that could berepresented as an “identification”, they parked the car and walked her down thesame street. By now, of course, it was obvious to Almond that whatever theywanted her to “recognize” was on that block and that block only [among thethousands in San Francisco!].66. Potter states: “While walking down Acme Avenue (north), on the east side ofthestreet, Almond appeared to show a behavioral change. Approximately 10-15 feetbefore coming to the front of 123 Acme Avenue, Almond began to appearfrightened and wanted to be held by her mother. Almond was picked up by hermother, but continued to stare at the front of 123 Acme Avenue.” [The 8/11/89CIDreport says that Almond grabbed her mother’s legs, but Agent Potter’s report ofthesame day as the trip does not specify this.]67. The 8/11/89 CID report states that, as soon as Michele picked up Almond astheywere approaching 123, she started talking to her telling her that “she was safeand no one would hurt her”. Since Almond had just been led through the “package”- 321 -story that morning, and since she had been told to identify a building, andsinceshe had been shown that it would be on the 100 block of Acme, for her mother topick her up and make comments like these to her as they came up to 123 is aboutasobvious a cue as can be imagined.68. Although the 8/11/89 CID report editorially states that Almond said at thismoment that 123 was the location in the “package story”, this is absolutelyrefuted by the CID 8/13/87 Potter report, in which it is quite explicit thatAlmondmade no statements concerning 123 whatever.69. Potter states: “Almond was taken further north on Acme Avenue, then back onthewest side of the street, where Almond then picked out an automobile as belongingto ‘Mickie and Shanbie’ (sic). The car was subsequently identified as a redcoloredsedan that had been rented by LTC Aquino.”70. The CID 8/11/89 report editorially states that Michele and Almond “weredirectedto cross the street and Almond was asked to examine five vehicles parked at thecurb”. This is another example of the deliberate editorial distortions of the8/11/89report, as it is totally unnecessary to cross to the west side of Acme toexamine thecars there [and, as noted below, it is dangerous]. However, if such instructionswere given to Almond, her attention was again narrowed to five cars from all theones along the block, none of which she had reacted to spontaneously.71. The CID 8/11/89 report editorially states that Almond picked out the redIsuzu as“Mrs. Shamby’s” car and said that she had ridden in it with her. This was ofcourseafter Michele and Lawrence Adams-Thompson had connected that car with us atthe PX, but before they discovered it to be only a rental car.From Potter’s on-site/same-day account it is clear that Almond did not“identify”123 Acme at all. She did not say anything about it, point at it, or refer to itin anyway whatever. Potter made a personal assumption only - that Almond “appearedto show a behavioral change”, whatever that is supposed to mean. Almond made nostatement that she was “frightened” or that she wanted to be held by her mother;allthat Potter’s report establishes is that Michele Adams-Thompson chose to pickAlmond up and hold her in front of 123 Acme, which of course dramatized thatlocation to her audience (Potter and Foreman) - and to Almond as well, whootherwise might have walked right past it. There is no indication that Almondwaslooking at 123 when “she began to appear frightened”, nor that she was in fact“frightened” at all. She didn’t, for example, either cry or try to run away.Even while being held stationary by Michele in front of 123 Acme, Almond saidnothing about the building and made no gestures concerning it. That she“continuedto stare at it” is not an “identification”. Nor, if her mother was holding herstationary- 322 -in front of it so that Almond’s face was turned toward it, is it surprising thatAlmondwould continue to look at the building. [Her only option would be to close hereyes orwrench her head around sideways.]It is significant to read in Potter’s report that Almond “was taken back on thewestside of the street”. There is no sidewalk on most of the west side of thatblock; rathercars are parked alongside a massive wall. There is a great deal of fast-movingtrafficfrom nearby Bay Street and Fisherman’s Wharf driving south on Acme, and it isparticularly dangerous to walk on the west side of 123 Acme because theintersectionapproaching it from the north is a blind one over a hill. It would have been allthemore dangerous to walk up the block on the west side with a small child. Thepartywould have had to walk out in the middle of the street, at risk of being hit bysouthbound traffic. Most probably the party walked up the east side of thestreetagain, in which case 123 Acme was passed again with no reaction orcomment whatever from Almond. Even if the party walked up the west side ofthe street, dodging traffic, 123 is just as visible from that side of the(2-lane) street asfrom the sidewalk in front of it. As there is only the blank concrete wallacross from iton the west side, there is nothing else to look at at that point of the block.Yet, as noted,Almond paid no attention to it whatever.Obviously, from seeing the car [and calling Almond’s attention to it] at the PXtheprevious day, the Adams-Thompsons concluded that it was our personally-ownedcar, hence coached Almond in advance to “identify” it if she saw it again aswell as to“identify” whatever building she was shown by her mother in the presence of theFBIagent. What Adams-Thompson did not know was that the Isuzu was a rental carwhich we had had for only a few days.As noted above, the 8/11/89 CID report editorially states that Almond wasspecificallytold to examine a group of five cars, thus (a) cueing her that she was onceagainsupposed to produce something from the “package story”, (b) cueing her that itwassupposed to be a car, and (c) cueing her that she should make her choice fromonlythose five cars exclusive of all the others on the street. As she had alreadybeencoached concerning the red Isuzu the Adams-Thompsons [and possibly Almondherself] had seen at the PX the day before, she knew what was expected of her.During the ensuing publicity, in which much was made of the alleged“identification”of our building, Adams-Thompson remained silent about the fact that no such“identification” ever happened, and also remained silent about the“identification of the Isuzu” fiasco - which, when the rental-nature of the carbecameknown, would have revealed that “identification” to have been coached. [IfAdams-Thompson knew about Hambright’s inability to drive a car anywhere, he alsoremained silent about that.]- 323 -72. In Foreman’s own 8/13/87 report of his interview with Michele, no mentionwhatever is made of this supposed “identification trip”. Assuming that Foremantook Michele and Almond to 123 Acme prior to writing this report, however,another of Michele’s “recollections” occurs: “Michele said that Kinsey hasfrequently described ‘Mr. Gary’s house’ as a house with several stairs leadingto thefront door and that it is gray in color.”The Hickey notes do not substantiate Michele’s “sudden recollection” that Almondhad“frequently described ‘Mr. Gary’s house’ as a house with several stairs leadingto thefront door and that it is gray in color”. Nor do any entries in Michele’sconstantly-changing “journal”. Throughout the 7-month period of Almond’s “therapy” sessionswith Hickey, there was no mention whatever of any house belonging to “Mikey” [or“Shamby”], nor of any gray house, nor of any house with stairs leading to thefrontdoor. This “sudden recollection” by Michele obviously post-dates her seeing ourbuilding, either on 8/12/87 in the company of Adams-Thompson & Almond or on8/13/87 in the company of Foreman and Potter before Foreman wrote this report.The trip to 123 Acme took place early in the morning (9:45 AM) on 8/13/89,making ithighly probable that Foreman’s report was written at a later time in the day.Could Almond have reacted to our building during the northward walk on 8/13/87without conspicuous prompting, holding, and direction of her eyes toward it byMichele at that moment? She could if she had been taken there before on 8/12/87andpre-coached to “identify” it. The Adams-Thompsons have acknowledged that theyclandestinely observed Mrs. Aquino and myself in the PX, and that theyclandestinelyfollowed us to our rental car, and that they were in their own car at the timewithAlmond. As we live only ten minutes away from the Presidio, and as we wentdirectlyhome with the microwave, and as we had no reason to drive quickly, it would havebeen quite easy for the Adams-Thompsons to follow us in their car, observe thehousewe entered, and coach Kinsey to “identify” it the next time she saw it. FromPotter’sreport it is clear that it was still necessary for Michele to pick up Almond andhold herwith her eyes towards the building to pretend that an “identification” tookplace.Obviously none did.E. After August 1987.73. After the SFPD raid revealed that the interior of our home did not match the“package story”, Adams-Thompson remained silent while Mrs. Aquino and myselfwent through an extended ordeal in the “witch-hunt” atmosphere surrounding thePresidio scandal. Although all the facts - from the actual interior of our hometo myestablished assignment to ICAF during the period of his allegation - would havedemonstrated our innocence to someone who had merely made “an honestmistake”, Adams-Thompson remained silent and unremorseful. He remains so tothis day, apparently quite satisfied with the intense harm he has caused to two- 324 -innocent people, and equally unconcerned with the embarrassment and waste ofresources he has caused the FBI, the San Francisco Police Department, and theUnited States Army.74. On 15 October 1987 Kinsey Almond, in the company of Michele Adams-Thompson,was interviewed by FBI Special Agents James Nice and Patricia Bradley. Solepurpose of the interview was to show Almond 35 photographs taken of our SanFrancisco home during the evening of the 8/14/87 forceable invasion and searchofour home. Almond made no response to any of the photos verifying that she hadever been inside the building. [She asked Agent Nice if it were his house!]Rathershe merely gave incoherent responses which I have discussed in a separate9/27/89 paper to the Commanding General, CIC.75. After showing Almond [and Michele] all of the photos with no questions, Niceshowed them again, asking Almond if she recognized anything. This time sherecited another obviously-coached phrase (“the haunted house”) six times. Shemade no mention of “Mr. Gary”, “Mikey”, “Shamby”, or any other name in eitherthe Hickey notes or Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s “package story” to the SFPD. Shementioned no element of that “package story” whatever. She made no reference toanyone resembling Michael or Lilith Aquino. She made no response to 24 of the 35photos, and to the others she gave completely nonsensical answers. Almond’scomments in this second run through the photos were in every case completelyinconsistent with her responses in the first run.76. Although Adams-Thompson was apparently not present for this interviewsession,he certainly heard about it later from his wife Michele, and learned that Almondhad not validly “identified” anything in the photos nor said anything at all tosupport any detail whatever of his “package story” to the SFPD. Nevertheless hedid not retract his allegations. Obviously the child’s failure to substantiatehisattack was not important to him as long as investigators were continuing to tryto“make it stick”.77. It is reasonable to assume that, after the story of Adams-Thompson’sallegationsbroke in the national media, he was informed of everything in that media whichdisproved his “package story”, to include a detailed television-tour of ourhome.78. On 20 December 1988 LTC William Hagan, SJA of the 25th Division, providedAdams-Thompson with copies of every letter, document, sworn statement, etc.which I had previously provided to the 25th Division in support of the UCMJcharges I preferred against Adams-Thompson for his malicious actions (a stack ofdocuments over 1 inch thick). At the time the CID interviewed the Adams-Thompsons in 1989, therefore, they had had abundant opportunity to revise their- 325 -accusations any way possible to avoid incriminating themselves and to attempt tofurther the CID’s evident effort to make any kind of a case against us.More than anything else, Adams-Thompson’s behavior after learning about theresults of the 8/14/87 invasion, and after learning of the results of the10/15/87 FBIinterview with Almond, puts the lie to the notion that he was “merely a neutralperson” without malice towards us. By his silence and disregard of the revealedfalsehoods of the “package story” that he had told Pamfiloff, he acted tosustain ourordeal, obviously in hope that we would ultimately be prosecuted, convicted, andimprisoned for a crime which he knew from the beginning had neveroccurred at all.79. On 2/25/88 Adams-Thompson was interviewed by CID Special Agent RalphFacundo of the CID. In this interview he said that I had “made statements in twoletters and a newsletter” that he interpreted as a “threat”.80. The first letter (8/28/87) stated my discovery that Adams-Thompson had beenresponsible for the false accusation against us that had caused our home to beraided and ransacked and ourselves and our families terrorized during the nightof8/14/87. This letter concluded:By your vicious, irresponsible, and thoroughly disgusting accusations you havebrought about the violation of my home, severe trauma to my wife and family, andan insult to my own integrity that is especially foul and loathsome, based as itisupon the sexual abuse of little children. Only if you send me immediately aletter ofcomplete and unqualified apology and retraction for this disgraceful conduct ofyours will I consider not taking legal action against you, via civil suit or perapplicable UCMJ provisions.81. The second letter (9/10/87) provided Adams-Thompson with a copy of a vulgarcard which I believed to have been sent by him in response to my 8/28/87 letter.This letter contained no elaboration upon the conclusion of the 8/28/87 letterwhatever, but simply concluded:If you care to deny having sent this card, I would welcome a letter from you tothat effect - and repudiating its message.82. No threat against Adams-Thompson was made in the Scroll of Set newsletter.Articles in the Scroll between the time of Adams-Thompson’s attack and thisinterview merely stated that I had requested his chain of command to takeappropriate administrative action concerning him, and that, if it would not, Iwould prefer court-martial charges against him. There was no statement- 326 -incorporating “just dues … just reward … or he’ll get his” as alleged by Adams-Thompson.Neither the letters nor the Scroll of Set newsletter contained any threatswhatever.Adams-Thompson was merely informed that, if on his own initiative he did not acttocorrect the serious and unjustified harm he had caused to Mrs. Aquino andmyself, Iwould seek to have these matters corrected through the legal systems of theUnitedStates and the U.S. Army. If Adams-Thompson were an innocent man, there is noreason why he should have to feel “threatened” by judicial review of hisactions.Adams-Thompson therefore lied in the 2/25/88 CID interview about the contents ofthe letters and the wording of the Scroll of Set .When asked during the same interview for a copy of the Scroll of Set newsletterinquestion, Adams-Thompson stated that he had a copy of it, but he did not produceit.For him to have done so would have revealed that the threatening wording heallegedit to contain did not in fact appear therein.83. On 4/10/89 Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson was interviewed by CID AgentCates. Among his statements were the following:Kinsey made various disclosures to her therapist Dr. (LTC) Hickey at LettermanArmyMedical Center, Presidio of San Francisco, CA, indicating that she had beensexuallyassaulted by one of her teachers, Mr. Gary Hambright, and also that she had beentakento his residence. Kinsey also mentioned the names of “Shamby” and “Mikey” aspeoplewho had been present at Mr. Hambright’s house. The disclosure of these namesoccurredshortly after she began seeing Dr. Hickey. However I only heard about this frommy wife(with whom Kinsey had been talking about the incidents), and from Dr. Hickey.Prior toAugust 87 I did not hear about “Shamby” and/or “Mikey” directly from Kinsey.Immediately after stating under oath that Kinsey had made these “disclosures” toHickey, Adams-Thompson revises this assertion to only hearsay information fromHickey and Michele. Therefore his statement that such “disclosures” were in factmadeis incompetent. Of course, if Lawrence and Michele Adams-Thompson invented the“package story” themselves in August 1987, then this sworn statement by Adams-Thompson is an outright lie, which he is attempting to hedge by projecting theresponsibility on to Michele and/or Hickey.F. Fraudulent Claims Against the Government.84. On 3/15/88 Adams-Thompson, Michele Adams-Thompson, and the two of themtogether on behalf of Kinsey Almond, filed claims totaling at least $3 millionagainst the U.S. Army for the supposed abuse of Kinsey Almond and the “seriousemotional and mental distress” they as mother and stepfather “suffered” as a- 327 -result. [The names on the claim-forms were deleted on the copies provided to me,but Captain Hayes was informed by Major Harvey that they were in the names ofthe two adult Adams-Thompsons and the two of them on behalf of KinseyAlmond.]As at the time Adams-Thompson and Michele knew full well that this abuse hadneverhappened, the filing of such claims constitutes a deliberate attempt by both ofthem todefraud the U.S. Government.G. Conclusions.The above facts establish that in not just one but a great many instancesLawrenceAdams-Thompson invented, told, and then attempted to sustain lies deliberatelydesigned to cause the greatest possible harm to another officer and his wife. Heperpetrated these lies in the form of formal statements to and interviews withinvestigating officials of the FBI, the San Francisco Police Department, and theU.S.Army 6RCID. He regularly attempted to modify those parts of the lies which hadbecome conspicuously weak, as highlighted by me in the supporting statementsaccompanying the 4 January 1988 UCMJ charges which I preferred against him. Hehas further attempted to defraud the U.S. Government by making false monetaryclaims based upon them.All of these actions clearly evidence Adams-Thompson’s repeated, deliberate, andextreme violations of Article #133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, andheshould be charged and prosecuted accordingly by General Court-Martial.- 328 -Appendix 35: Letter, Major General Otstott toMichael Aquino 12/29/89Headquarters 25th Infantry Division (Light)APVG-CG29 December 1989MEMORANDUM FOR: LTC Michael A. AquinoSUBJECT: Request for Inquiry1. You asked that I reopen the inquiry conducted into the charges that youpreferredagainst Captain Lawrence Adams-Thompson of this command.2. I decline to do so. In my opinion, COL Sierra’s inquiry compliedsubstantially withthe requirements of R.CM. 303. COL Sierra dismissed the charges; MG Crysel, the25thInfantry Division (Light) Commander and General Court-Martial ConveningAuthority,ratified that decision; and, later, upon your application, LTG Bagnal,Commander,WESTCOM, reaffirmed those subordinate commanders’ decisions.3. The “new” charge relating to what you see as a fraudulent claim is, in myopinion,supported by much of the same evidence as was delved into during the originalinquiryand, therefore, does not justify an additional investigation. What you haveprovided usand others during the past year and more, together with what we gathered duringtheoriginal inquiry, adequately supports the original decision and my determinationto letthe matter rest.4. You raise no new evidence, only opinion. That you, as complainant, may bedissatisfied with official disposition of charges that does not accord with yourview ofjustice is not surprising. The UCMJ, as any other criminal code, exists not as aprivatevehicle for righting perceived wrongs. Instead, duly constituted authoritieshave theduty to inquire and decide in accordance with the law and their consciences.Threecommanders, acting upon the advice of legal officers, have so done. Nothing youhaveraised sufficiently shifts the burden upon the Army to reopen the inquiry.5. Accordingly, I dismiss the charges you preferred on 29 November 1989./s/ Charles P. OtstottMajor General, USACommanding- 329 -Appendix 36: Letter, Michael Aquino to Lt. General Bagnall 1/5/90January 5, 1990Lieutenant General Charles W. BagnalCommanding General, U.S. Army Western CommandFort Shafter, HI 96858-5100Dear General Bagnal:I have just received the enclosed 12/29/89 letter from General Otstottdismissingthe 11/29/89 charges which I preferred against Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson.The reasons which General Otstott gives for dismissal of the charges are notfactually correct and do not justify his dismissal of the charges. GeneralOtstott’ scomments follow in Italics with my annotations in regular type:In my opinion, Colonel Sierra’s inquiry complied substantially with therequirements of R.C.M. 303.• RCM #303 requires the commander (in this case Colonel Sierra, Adams-Thompson’s brigade commander) to “... gather all reasonably available evidencebearing on guilt or innocence and any evidence relating to aggravation,extenuation, or mitigation”.• Colonel Sierra did not interview or even contact either of the two victims ofAdams-Thompson’s crime (Mrs. Aquino and myself).• There is no record in Colonel Sierra’s correspondence to General Crysel (CG ofthe 25th Division at the time of his #303 inquiry) that Sierra ever personallyinterviewed Adams-Thompson about the details of the charges as contained inmy sworn statement in support of them.• Colonel Sierra based his recommendation for dismissal upon a CID report ofinvestigation which contained no actual investigation into the details of theprincipal charge (Specification #1) whatever. Colonel Sierra’s acceptance ofsuchan inadequate report from the CID was improper.• It is therefore quite clear that Colonel Sierra did not comply with therequirements of RCM #303 in his inquiry.- 330 -Colonel Sierra dismissed the charges; Major General Crysel, the 25th InfantryDivision (Light) Commander and General Court-Martial Convening Authority,ratified that decision; and, later, upon your application, Lieutenant GeneralBagnal,Commander, WESTCOM, reaffirmed those subordinate commanders’ decisions.As demonstrated above, Colonel Sierra’s dismissal of the charges was improper inthat he failed to conduct a thorough and relevant inquiry as required by RCM#303:• Colonel Sierra represented to General Crysel that he had conducted a properinquiry, and obviously General Crysel took him at his word.• It is just as understandable for a succeeding division commander (GeneralOtstott) to defend the actions of his predecessor, and for the higherheadquarterscommander (yourself) to defend the actions of two general officers under yourcommand.• If the above deficiencies in Colonel Sierra’s #303 inquiry were not identifiedbyany of these three general officers, however, it is apparent that their reviewofSierra’s handling of the inquiry was not sufficiently precise.• The fact that three superior officers failed to identify the deficiencies intheinquiry, therefore, does not in itself excuse those deficiencies nor justify thecontinued acceptance of that inquiry as adequate.The “new” charge relating to what you see as a fraudulent claim is, in myopinion,supported by much of the same evidence as was delved into during the originalinquiry and, therefore, does not justify an additional investigation.• The “new” charge - that of Adams-Thompson’s efforts to defraud the governmentof as much as $3 million in false claims money - is indeed supported byevidence.• It is not true, however, that this evidence “was delved into during theoriginalinquiry”. The vast majority of documentary evidence provided with these newcharges was either concealed from Colonel Sierra by the CID at the time of hisinquiry or had not yet been collected and correlated (as in the 84-item factsheetof Adams-Thompson’s crimes accompanying the 11/29/89 charges).• An additional investigation into Adams-Thompson’s attempt to defraud thegovernment is therefore indeed justified.What you have provided us and others during the past year and more, togetherwith what we gathered during the original inquiry, adequately supports theoriginaldecision and my determination to let the matter rest.- 331 -• The evidence which I have provided to the 25th Division has never beenevaluatedby Colonel Sierra, nor in the present instance by General Otstott. Not one itemidentified in the list of Adams-Thompson’s violations has been addressed in any25th Division document. [I possess a set of the correspondence from ColonelSierra to the 25th Division Judge Advocate and Commanding General on thismatter.]• Accordingly General Otstott cannot state that “the evidence supports theoriginaldecision”.• A “determination to let the matter rest” conveys the implication that thechargeswill not be investigated because they are inconvenient and troublesome. Iappreciate that it would be extremely politically unpopular for a Christianchaplain to be prosecuted for a crime against a soldier and his wife who happentobe members of a non-favored religion. However this is not a nation of politicalexpediency, nor of preferential treatment to only certain religions. It is anation oflaw, most principally the Constitution which all Army officers, includingGeneralOtstott, are sworn to uphold. The First and Fourteenth Amendments to thatConstitution require General Otstott to order an inquiry into any crimesupportedby factual evidence, including this one, whether or not it was committed by achaplain.You raise no new evidence, only opinion.• Provided with the 11/29/89 charges are thirteen items of documentary evidencenot available to Colonel Sierra at the time of the original 1/4/88 charges.• One of these items is a 15-page, 84-item analysis of Adams-Thompson’sviolations of Article 133 UCMJ. Each numbered entry in this analysis isestablished, documented fact, with “opinion” (i.e. analysis) appearing asseparate,un-numbered annotations in Italics.• General Otstott’s statement is thus incorrect.That you, as complainant, may be dissatisfied with official disposition ofchargesthat does not accord with your view of justice is not surprising.• I am not a “complainant”, but a commissioned officer who has formallypreferredcharges with due consideration to the serious nature of such an action, and, asGeneral Otstott also knows, after first exhausting every less-formal avenue toseeAdams-Thompson brought to account for his crimes.- 332 -• It is a UCMJ convening authority’s right to dispose with charges, of course,and Iwould accept such disposition if it were in fact based upon a properly-conductedand factually-substantiated RCM #303 inquiry. Quite obviously this is not thecase with either the 1/4/88 charges or these 11/29/89 charges.• “My view” of justice is not at issue. Justice itself is the issue. If aninvestigation isnot properly conducted, then it is impossible for justice to be served asrequiredby law. If such an investigation produces evidence that substantiates dismissalofthe charges, that is “my view” of justice. If the investigation producesevidencethat substantiates the formal consideration of that evidence by a court-martial,that too is “my view” of justice.The UCMJ, as any other criminal code, exists not as a private vehicle forrightingperceived wrongs.• I am not attempting to use the UCMJ as such a “private vehicle”.• On the other hand, the UCMJ does exist to provide for the protection ofsoldiersand others against crimes perpetrated by persons subject to the code, as Adams-Thompson is. It offers a means by which apparent crimes can be formally andmethodically evaluated, and the apparent perpetrators either exonerated orpunished as the UCMJ prescribes.• A UCMJ commander’s disposition authority should not be invoked to prevent thethorough and objective investigation of apparent crimes.Instead, duly constituted authorities have the duty to inquire and decide inaccordance with the law and their consciences.• It is precisely my point that duly constituted authorities have the duty toinquire -and only then to decide. They do not have the prerogative, as in this instance,tomake decisions without conducting a proper, relevant, and thorough inquiryinto the evidence presented.• A person’s conscience is a measure of what he believes to be the moral rightandwrong of a situation. Because of the controversial and emotionally-chargedreligious dimensions to this case, “conscience” is all the more unreliable abasisfor a disposition decision. Such a decision should be based upon the facts ofthesituation, not upon the convening authority’s moral opinions.• Most importantly, the United States is a society in which justice isestablished bylaw, not by the moral opinions of persons in positions of authority. It isprecisely- 333 -the purpose of law to provide standards of social conduct which apply to allcitizens regardless of their personal moral outlook.Three commanders, acting upon the advice of legal officers, have so done.• The actions of General Otstott, General Crysel, and Colonel Sierra, asdiscussedabove, are unsupported by the evidence in this case and were also influenced bydeliberate attempts by the CID to suppress evidence and mislead the #303inquiry officer.• There is no documentation to indicate that the legal advisor of GeneralOtstottreviewed Colonel Sierra’s report to ensure its compliance with RCM #303 uponmy request to him to reinstitute the 1/4/88 charges following General Crysel’sdismissal of them.• The only evidence of legal advice to Colonel Sierra is a 5/27/88 memorandumfrom Captain Theodore Dixon, Assistant SJA of the 25th Division, recommendingdismissal of the charges following Sierra’s submission of his paperwork. Thereisno indication whatever in this memorandum that either Dixon or any other legalofficer examined that paperwork for completeness, pertinence to the charges, orcompliance with RCM #303. As Sierra’s paperwork was not returned to him forcorrection and completion as required by RCM #303, it is obvious that the SJAoffice of the 25th Division did not review it adequately, if at all.Nothing you have raised sufficiently shifts the burden upon the Army to reopentheinquiry.• None of the evidence and documentation I have provided, either with these11/29/89 charges or with the 1/4/88 charges, has been investigated as requiredby RCM #303.• There is thus no “burden to be shifted” to the Army. The burden was andremainswith the Army - specifically with the 25th Division - to comply with the UniformCode of Military Justice and conduct a proper, thorough, and relevant RCM #303inquiry.The realities of this situation are quite clear to me, and I presume to both youandGeneral Otstott as well. At issue here is not just this specific case, butindeed whetherUnited States law applies equally and fairly to all soldiers regardless of theirreligion, orwhether some are to be protected against accountability for crimes which theymaycommit because of their “favored” religious office while others are to be deniedequalprotection of the law, and deliberately persecuted, because of their“non-favored”religious faith.- 334 -I request that you order General Otstott to comply with United States law,reinstitute the 11/29/89 charges, and direct that a proper RCM #303 inquiry beconducted forthwith.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

This replies finally to your letter to Lieutenant General Charles W. Bagnal,U.S.Army, Retired, concerning your charges against Chaplain (Captain)Adams-Thompson.2. I decline to reopen an investigation into those charges.3. From the beginning of this controversy, the only substantive issue has beenwhether Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s young daughter, Kimberly, told the truth whenshe related her story to the San Francisco Police. During Colonel Sierra’sinquiry, theoriginal investigator stated that he interviewed Kimberly outside the presenceof herparents. That investigator was trained in investigating such offenses. He didnot believethat Kimberly was coached by her parents. Further, Chaplain Adams-Thompson andhis wife deny coaching Kimberly. The investigator found Kimberly credible andsoughta warrant based upon her statement. A neutral magistrate found that probablecauseexisted and issued a warrant.4. Nothing you have sent causes me to question the initial conclusions of thatinvestigator. You state that Chaplain Adams-Thompson coached his daughter; hedenies it. The only other evidence available on that issue is the San FranciscoPoliceinvestigator’s conclusions based-upon extensive training and experience in thisarea.5. Colonel Sierra, Major General Crysel, Major General Otstott, LieutenantGeneralBagnal, and now, I have considered this evidence and have decided to dismisschargesagainst Chaplain Adams-Thompson. Absent newly discovered evidence, I will notconduct further inquiry into this matter./s/ Claude M. KicklighterLieutenant General, U S ArmyCommanding174 This indicates that this letter was drafted by the Staff Judge Advocaterather than the CommandingGeneral personally.- 336 -Appendix 38: Letter, Michael Aquino toLt. General Kicklighter 4/23/90April 23, 1990Lieutenant General Claude M. KicklighterCommanding GeneralU.S. Army Western CommandFort Shafter, HI 96858-5100Dear General Kicklighter:I have today received the April 18, 1990 letter from your Staff Judge Advocate’soffice over your signature. The many factual falsehoods in its statements madeby yourSJA embarrass you as the signer of that letter. Moreover, to the extent that thelettermay appear to be an action to obstruct justice, it reflects adversely uponWESTCOMcommand responsibilities.The reasons the SJA gives for declining to reinstitute the court-martial chargesagainst Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson and see that a proper RCM #303 inquiryis conducted, as U.S. law requires, are not factually correct and accordingly donotjustify a decision to prevent the UCMJ from being properly applied. The SJAstatements follow in Italics with my corrections in regular type:From the beginning of this controversy, the only substantive issue has beenwhether Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s young daughter, Kimberly, told the truth whenshe related her story to the San Francisco Police.• This is not a mere “controversy” to be resolved as such. Formal court-martialcharges have been preferred in accordance with the UCMJ. Formal proceduresare required to inquire into those charges. Those procedures were not followed,as detailed in my 1/5/90 letter to your predecessor General Bagnal. It is yourresponsibility as a commander to ensure that your subordinate commandersfollow the UCMJ properly, thoroughly, and objectively when it has been formallyinvoked by an officer (myself) with the right to prefer charges.• Chaplain Adams-Thompson has no daughter named “Kimberly”, and the actualchild in question is not his daughter at all. He is the stepfather to KinseyAlmond,his wife’s daughter by a previous marriage. It is this child which hedeliberatelyused as a means for him to make false and malicious allegations against Mrs.Aquino and myself.- 337 -• Almond never related any story to the San Francisco Police. As is clearlystatedon the official SFPD report, it is Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson whomade the allegations, inventing a fictitious incident which he alleged to havehappened to his daughter. Documentary evidence previously provided to youverifies that she herself told no such story.During Colonel Sierra’s inquiry, the original investigator stated that heinterviewed Kimberly outside the presence of her parents. That investigator wastrained in investigating such offenses. He did not believe that Kimberly wascoachedby her parents.• I possess and have reviewed the documentary records of Colonel Sierra’sinquiry.There is no record of his ever speaking with the original investigator(Sergeant/Inspector Glenn Pamfiloff, SFPD).• The official SFPD record does not substantiate that Pamfiloff ever interviewedKinsey Almond [not “Kimberly”] outside the presence of her parents. The recordestablishes that she was taken to Pamfiloff by Chaplain Adams-Thompson onthe morning of 8/14/87, and that he alone did the talking to Pamfiloff.• Whether trained to investigate such allegations or not, Pamfiloff conductedthisparticular investigation improperly, as has been formally and officiallydetermined by the Office of Citizen Complaints, San Francisco PoliceCommission. He has since been reassigned to another division of the SFPD wherehe will not have the opportunity to conduct any further such juvenileinvestigations.• Since Almond made no statements to Pamfiloff herself, he would have had noreason to offer an opinion whether “coaching” took place or not. Nor, as notedabove, did Colonel Sierra ever speak with him.Further, Chaplain Adams-Thompson and his wife deny coaching Kimberly.• Documentary evidence previously provided to you establishes, by comparisonof official FBI, SFPD, and CID records, that the Adams-Thompsons havelied many times since they first participated in the Presidio of San Francisco“child abuse” fraud.• The essence of the charges preferred against Adams-Thompson is that (a) he hasmade a false official statement and that (b) he has initiated false claimsagainstthe U.S. government in an effort to defraud it of several million dollars.- 338 -• The Adams-Thompsons are aware of the penalties they may face when theircriminal actions are ultimately exposed.• Any unsupported “denial” by them under these circumstances does not constitutegrounds to prevent court-martial charges from being properly and thoroughlyinvestigated as required by law.The investigator found Kimberly credible and sought a warrant based upon herstatement.• As noted above, Pamfiloff interviewed only Chaplain Adams-Thompson andthus could not evaluate Kinsey Almond’s [not “Kimberly”] credibility at all. Nordid Pamfiloff make any statement in his report concerning Almond’s credibility.• Pamfiloff sought a warrant based upon Chaplain Adams-Thompson’sallegations, and based upon malicious religious propaganda against me fromanother officer in the SFPD (whom the OCC of the Police Commission has alsoofficially cited for that violation of SFPD procedures and ethics).• The OCC of the Police Commission has officially determined that the warrant inquestion was improperly executed.• The San Francisco Municipal Court has ordered all property seized under thatwarrant returned to Mrs. Aquino and myself, and it has been so returned by theSFPD.A neutral magistrate found that probable cause existed and issued a warrant.• Your SJA has no grounds to establish the “neutrality” of the magistrate whoauthorized the warrant.• There is no record that the magistrate in question critically examinedPamfiloff’saffidavit at all.• Pamfiloff’s affidavit contains nothing in support of his request for thewarrantexcept a recital of the fake, unsupported allegations made to him by ChaplainAdams-Thompson.• The mere issuance of the warrant under such conditions as these is not groundsfor the court-martial charges against Adams-Thompson to be improperlydismissed.- 339 -Nothing you have sent causes me to question the initial conclusions of thatinvestigator.• In fact, your Staff Judge Advocate’s letter neither responds to nor refutesany ofthe numerous facts substantiating the charges against Adams-Thompson, norany of the numerous facts substantiating improper disposition of those chargesby the 25th Division.• There is no evidence that any of this material was seriously evaluated by yourSJA at all. The numerous errors and inaccuracies in the letter which the SJAprovided for you to sign - without even the name of the Adams-Thompsonstepdaughter being correct! - is evidence of this negligence.• As noted above, Pamfiloff’s “initial conclusions” were based simply uponAdams-Thompson’s personal allegations and religious propaganda. Subsequently thedistrict attorney’s office declined to file any charges based upon those“initialconclusions”, and the OCC/San Francisco Police Commission issued an officialfinding against Pamfiloff for improper conduct of that investigation. Theselaterestablished facts supersede his “initial conclusions” as relevant to yourdecision.You state that Chaplain Adams-Thompson coached his daughter; he denies it.What I have stated - and formally charged - is that Chaplain Adams-Thompsonmade false official statements as specified in the Charge Sheet andsubstantiated by thesupporting documentation provided to the 25th Division and to you. Since hisstepdaughter [not his “daughter”] never once successfully recited the storywhich hehas tried to attribute to her, it is evident that any “coaching” of her which heand hiswife may have attempted has been quite unsuccessful.As noted above, any unsupported denial which Adams-Thompson may makeconcerning the charges must be weighed against the proven facts and documentaryevidence of his many false statements as provided with the charges. It is thusnot aquestion of “my word against Adams-Thompson’s”, but rather of Adams-Thompson’sword against documentation which proves him to be a liar.The only other evidence available on that issue is the San Francisco Policeinvestigator’s conclusions based upon extensive training and experience in thisarea.Together with the charges, I provided the 25th Division and WESTCOM abundantevidence - including a 15-page, 84-item detailed and documented summary ofAdams-Thompson’s violations of #133 UCMJ - pertaining to the charges. None of this- 340 -evidence has been refuted, or even mentioned, by either the 25th Divisionor your SJA in this latest letter.• The suppression or concealment of material evidence in support of a crime isitself a violation of the UCMJ’s Article 134 relative to obstruction of justice( Manual for Courts Martial 1984, IV, #96).• Pamfiloff’s “initial conclusions” and “extensive training/experience” havebeendiscussed adequately above.Colonel Sierra, Major General Crysel, Major General Otstott, Lieutenant GeneralBagnal, and now, I have considered this evidence and have decided to dismisschargesagainst Chaplain Adams-Thompson.• Colonel Sierra conducted an improper, incomplete, and inadequate RCM #303investigation, as documented by me to General Otstott and General Bagnal.• General Crysel dismissed the initial charges based solely upon ColonelSierra’simproper, incomplete, and inadequate RCM #303 investigation.• General Otstott, in his 12/29/89 letter to me, gave reasons for dismissing there-preferred charges which, as documented in my 1/5/90 letter to General Bagnal,were not factually correct and do not justify his dismissal of the charges.• General Bagnal neither replied to nor refuted any of the points contained inmy1/5/90 letter to him.• This 4/18/90 letter signed by you neither replies to nor refutes any of thepointscontained in my 1/5/90 letter to your predecessor General Bagnal.• Under these circumstances the dismissal of the charges against Adams-Thompson is improper and unjustified, absent conduct of a proper RCM #303investigation in which pertinent evidence as provided is neither suppressed norignored.Absent newly discovered evidence, I will not conduct further inquiry into thismatter.• Such evidence has already been provided to the 25th Division and yourself. Todate it has merely not been acknowledged, addressed, nor refuted.- 341 -I again request that you order General Otstott to comply with United States law,reinstitute the 11/29/89 charges, and direct that a proper RCM #303 inquiry beconducted forthwith.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military Intelligence- 342 -Appendix 39: “Army Stands by Satanist”, The Washington TimesArmy Stands by Satanist, Despite Cry from Public- by Peter AlmondThe Washington TimesDecember 27, 1988, page #A1Lt. Col. Michael Aquino has given the Army a devil of a time over the past fewweeks.He appeared on Geraldo Rivera’s television talk show in late October. LookinglikeDracula in “satanic” clerical garb, he declared his belief in Satanism. Sincethen, Armyofficials have been bombarded by demands for his dismissal.“We’ve had hundreds of phone calls from people complaining about him, from allover the country,” said Army spokesman Lt. Col. Greg Rixon. “At one count, wehad 75letters, more than we’ve had on any other issue.”Col. Aquino told viewers that his firm belief in Satanism is as legitimate asanyoneelse’s beliefs. He added that the Army does not object to his beliefs.A few months earlier, Col. Aquino and his wife Lilith had made a similarappearanceon Oprah Winfrey’s show.One of Col. Aquino’s most vehement critics is an Army recruiter in West Seneca,New York. Told by a potential recruit he no longer wanted an Army career becauseitharbored such men, Sgt. 1st Class Robert Moak wrote the Army Times:“Is this not the Army of ‘values?’ It seems inconsistent with what I know of allthetenets of devil worship for the Army to allow this practice. I know thatreligiousfreedom is fundamental to our form of government, but give me a break. The Armycancertainly abridge such freedoms if they are found to be ‘prejudicial to goodorder anddiscipline.’”The Army steadfastly rejects such criticism.“Lt. Col. Aquino is protected by the U.S. Constitution. He serves admirably inhisunit in St. Louis,” said Col. Rixon. “I’ve known about him for two years. By allaccountshe is an exemplary officer.“I believe it would be impossible to make a case that Lt. Col. Aquino is adivisiveinfluence. He is very careful to inform his commander of his activities relatingto hisreligious beliefs. He practices nothing, to our knowledge, that interferes withhis work.”The Army is keeping open a much-publicized inquiry against Col. Aquino involvingalleged child sex abuse at the Presidio in San Francisco in 1986.However, according to the Army and Col. Aquino, San Francisco police have closedthe case without charging him.A military intelligence analyst by trade, Col. Aquino, 42, has been in the Armyfor 19years. He dispatched helicopters on special operations psychological missions inVietnam in 1969-70, receiving the Bronze Star and Air Medal.- 343 -He left the Army in 1972175 and became a Merrill Lynch broker. He got apoliticalscience doctorate at the University of California in San Francisco176 , andreturned tothe Army in 1981.177 He spent last year at the Industrial College of the ArmedForces atFort McNair and is now handling budgets at the Army Reserve Personnel Center inSt.Louis.“The Army has known about my religious beliefs for nearly 20 years,” he said inaninterview. “But it’s not what people think.”He is a member of the Temple of Set, a group of “less than 1,000.” Contrary toinformation in the Army Chaplain’s 1978 handbook, he said, “Setians have nofertilityrites. They do not drink blood, molest children or perform other deviant actspopularlyascribed to them,” he said.The church’s beliefs, he said, require a “college-level education” tounderstand.Setians believe Judeo-Christian religions have established Satan - “the oldestgod everknown to humanity” - as a “straw man” to justify their guilt for man’s ejectionfrom theGarden of Eden. 178Lt. Col. Aquino said his upturned eyebrows and black widow’s peak are naturalfeatures. His wife, Lilith - a legal name-change based on the Jewish legend ofAdam’sfirst wife, who became a child-attacking demon at the creation of Eve - is“naturallypale, ” he said.179He said the furor over his TV appearances has led him to “tone down” hisphysicallooks, but the Army has not pressured him and he feels no conflict between hisvaluesand the Army’s.“The Constitution is for everyone,” said Col. Rixon, a Roman Catholic. “If it’sMichael Aquino [as a target] today, it’s Buddhists tomorrow. Who knows? It’smuchsafer to tolerate that which is bizarre and outside the mainstream of AmericanJudeo-Christian beliefs than slice that principle so fine it all disappears.”In West Seneca, Sgt. Moak said he thought about leaving the Army because it hasnot objected to Col. Aquino’s beliefs.But his Army Times letter prompted a response from Army public affairs that hesaid “calmed me down a little.”175 Correctly: transferred from the Regular Army to the Army Reserve.176 Correctly: the University of California, Santa Barbara.177 Correctly: went from part-time (Troop Program Unit) to full-time (ActiveGuard & Reserve) statusin the USAR.178 An inaccurate quote, probably because of the reporter’s confusion. I wouldhave said that Set is oneof, if not the earliest gods known to humanity, pre-dating Judæo-Christianity byseveral thousandyears, and later corrupted by those religions into its “Satan”.179 Lilith chose her name not because of this reporter’s quoted attribution, butbecause she liked itssound, and because in his Satanic Bible Anton LaVey whimsically referred toLilith as “Adam’s firstwife, who taught him the ropes”.- 344 -“I’m not a religious guy, but it’s still distasteful, at best,” he said. “I havea hard timeaccepting Satanism as a religion. It’s not just atheism; it’s believing in theopposite ofGod. I still hold it’s a problem. It’s potentially a bad situation if you allowthis in thefield.”Meanwhile, Col. Aquino and his wife reportedly spent Christmas quietly readingbooks.“I don’t begrudge Christians celebrating Christmas at all,” he said.- 345 -Appendix 40: Letter, Army Vice Chief of Staff tothe President of NBC 12/2/88Department of the ArmyOffice of the Chief of StaffWashington, D.C. 20310-02002 December 1988Mr. Robert WrightPresident and Chief Executive OfficerNational Broadcasting Corporation30 Rockefeller PlazaNew York, New York 10112Dear Mr. Wright:By now I’m sure you believe you’ve received more than enough criticism of yourrecent presentation, “Devil Worship - Exposing Satan’s Underground.” I intend toaddto that criticism by providing counterpoints to a number of inaccurate andmisleadingstatements, implications and innuendoes about the Army made during the show.First, I will address Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino’s Temple of Set. Theshowcut to a recording of the Temple of Set’s answering machine which says, “TheTemple isthe only international religious institution fully recognized by the UnitedStatesGovernment.” The narrator then said that, “Indeed, the Army does recognizesatanismas a legitimate religion.”The implication here is that the Army sanctions or endorses Lieutenant ColonelAquino’s church. In fact, the Army does not endorse the satanic cult. As proofof thisso-called endorsement, the narrator said, “The Army ... supplies chaplains withthisguide for ministering to the satanic soldier.”The guide shown on the screen is Department of the Army Pamphlet 165-13(Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook forChaplains). The pamphlet serves as an informational tool about beliefs andpractices ofmany religious groups to help chaplains and commanders to respond to questions.Itclearly is not an endorsement of satanic practice.A second area where the broadcast implied the Army endorses satanic practicesfollowed from the statement, “Yet, unofficially, some charge that Army baseshavebecome sanctuaries for devil worshipers.” Rest assured that Army commanders andlaw enforcement officers do not tolerate lawlessness on Army installations.Vandalism,- 346 -as portrayed, would indeed be investigated by proper authorities if it hadoccurredwithin an area under Army jurisdiction.The narrator also said, “Just last month, under a full moon, I took a midnighttour ofthe Presidio grounds.” Later he said, “... operating right here on the Armybase.” Thenarrator may indeed have toured the Presidio grounds at midnight (it’s an openpost),but he certainly didn’t film satanic graffiti, “... right here on the Armybase,” since thebunkers he showed are on grounds of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area,outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army. Colonel Joseph Rafferty, Commander ofthePresidio, personally explained to the narrator that the bunkers filmed for theshowwere not on Army property.I was particularly troubled by the implication that the Army tolerates childabusecommitted in the name of satan. Clearly, we do not. Yet that is exactly what thebroadcasting technique seemed to convey when it was said, “It was here, parentsandothers allege, that as many as 60 young children were ritualistically abused bysoldiers(pause) of satan.” Using the word “soldiers” instead of “followers”, as well aspausingdramatically between “soldiers” and “of satan,” unfairly implied thatritualistic childabuse was widespread and deeply rooted in the military community. As you know,allegations of ritualistic child abuse have indeed surfaced at the Presidio. Letme assureyou, we are actively investigating the allegations which are within ourjurisdiction andare cooperating fully with investigations by local and other federalauthorities.Since this show aired, we have received dozens of calls and more thanseventy-fiveletters challenging us to defend the “fact” that we are harboring satanists likeMichaelAquino. Our answer is simple. We don’t “harbor” satanists. What we do is ensurethatall soldiers are afforded the full privilege of their Constitutional rights.Your audience was poorly served by your show, and you bear substantialresponsibility for that. The show wove a web of innuendoes designed to place theArmyin the worst possible light. The American public, the Army, and all soldiersdeservemore than that from your network.Sincerely,/s/ Arthur E. Brown, Jr.General, United States ArmyVice Chief of Staff[While not included with General Brown’s letter to Mr. Wright, thefollowing staff paper was provided to Brown for his use in drafting thatletter. - M. Aquino]- 347 -THE FOLLOWING POINT/COUNTERPOINT PAPER WAS PREPARED BY OCPA-MRD180 FOR USE BY VCSA. OTJAG181 SUGGESTED MANY CHANGES FROM THEORIGINAL VERSION THAT ARE NOW INCORPORATED IN THIS DRAFT. THISDRAFT WAS APPROVED 31 OCTOBER 1988. (LTC Greg Rixon/77589)Point/CounterpointGeraldo Rivera’s Devil Worship - Exposing Satan’s UndergroundPoint 1: The show cuts to a recording of the Temple of Set’s telephone answeringmachine which says, “The Temple is the only international religious institutionfully recognized by the United States Government.” Rivera then goes on to saythat “Indeed the Army does recognize satanism as a legitimate religion.”Counterpoint 1: For LTC Aquino and Rivera to claim government recognition of theTemple of Set is specious. The U.S. Army does not endorse any specific religiousgroup.Point 2: The Army “... supplies chaplains with this guide for ministering to thesatanicsoldier.”Counterpoint 2: The guide shown on the screen is DA Pamphlet 165-13 ( ReligiousRequirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook forChaplains. ) The pamphlet addresses the beliefs and practices of many religiousgroups, and is provided to chaplains and commanders to assist in many ways. Forinstance, it is used to help chaplains advise soldiers who may be questioningtheirown faith, or may be considering adoption of a new religion. It is provided toassist in evaluating the sincerity, accuracy and depth of belief of thosesoldiersconsidering conscientious objector status. The pamphlet also helps commandersmake operational decisions, since it can provide insight into the impactmilitaryoperations may have on local citizens of a predominant religious group. Thepamphlet is not designed to assist chaplains in ministering to the satanicsoldier,or any other soldier. The section addressing the Church of Satan merely outlineswhat adherents to this group profess, and how they express their beliefs. Thepamphlet is informational in nature, not directive.Point 3: Rivera states “yet, unofficially, some charge that Army bases havebecomesanctuaries for devil worshippers.”Counterpoint 3: Army commanders and law enforcement officers do not toleratelawlessness on Army installations. Vandalism, as portrayed by Rivera, would180 Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, Department of the Army.181 Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army.- 348 -indeed be investigated by proper authorities if it had occurred within an areaunder Army jurisdiction.Point 4: Rivera goes on to say, “Just last month, under a full moon, I took amidnighttour of the Presidio grounds.” He later says, “operating right here on the Armybase.”Counterpoint 4: Rivera may indeed have toured the Presidio grounds at midnight(it’s an open post,) but he certainly didn’t film satanic graffiti “...righthere on theArmy base” since the bunkers he showed are on grounds of the Golden GateNational Recreation Area outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army. ColonelJoseph Rafferty, commander of the Presidio, personally explained to Rivera thatthe bunkers he filmed were not on Army property. Rivera disregarded thisinformation in order to further sensationalize his charges against the Army.Point 5: “Joseph,” a former Army officer, says that satanic organizations were“active”on the Presidio with the full knowledge of Army authorities. Colonel Raffertysayshe is unaware of any satanic activity.Counterpoint 5: The implication here is that the Army must stop or punishsatanicactivities on an Army base regardless of the form they take. Clearly, if thehideouscrimes described by Rivera throughout the show were performed on base, theywould be investigated and appropriate judicial action would be taken. However,peaceful and legal religious belief and practice will not be judged or tested bytheArmy. In the absence of any evidence of criminal activity, neither the Army, norany other government agency, can impose itself.Point 6: “Satanism may be a constitutionally protected religion,but, similar toanother recent case at the United States Military Academy at West Point, here(PSF) charges surfaced connecting ritual child abuse at the Presidio Day CareCenter to the devil cult.”Counterpoint 6: Allegations of ritualistic child abuse have indeed surfaced atbothWest Point and Presidio, San Francisco. However, to date no charges ofritualisticabuse have been substantiated. Despite intense effort by the respective U.S.attorneys, evidence sufficient to support a prosecution was lacking. Noconnection between the cases at West Point and Presidio, San Francisco has everbeen made by any competent agency.Point 7: “It was here, parents and others allege, that as many as 60 youngchildrenwere ritualistically abused by soldiers ... of satan.”- 349 -Counterpoint 7: Here Rivera’s broadcasting technique was misleading. Histheatricalpause between the words “soldiers” and “of satan” implied that the child abusealleged to have occurred at the Presidio was performed by soldiers. No soldierhasever been implicated in the cases at either West Point or the Presidio.Point 8: Rivera asks LTC Aquino, “You are still a serving officer, a colonel, intheUnited States Army. Do you feel it is inconsistent with a high ranking officerpledged, sworn, to uphold the Constitution of the United States, that you arealsoa practicing satanist?”Counterpoint 8: A soldier’s religious beliefs cannot, and should not, be testedorquestioned in any way. The practice of his or her religion is another matter. Ifany soldier commits a crime in the name of his or her religion, he or she can heprosecuted for it.The same First Amendment that protects NBC’s or Geraldo Rivera’s right topublish and broadcast protects soldiers’ rights to religious beliefs outside themainstream of Judeo/Christian tradition. Justice Jackson, writing in anothercontext in 1943, said, “Freedom to differ is not limited to things that do notmatter much. That would be the mere shadow of freedom. The test of itssubstance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of theexistingorder.”- 350 -Appendix 41: Letter, Michael Aquino toArmy Vice Chief of Staff 6/2/89June 2, 1989General Robert W. RisCassiVice Chief of Staff, United States ArmyPentagon Building #3E666Washington, D.C. 20310Dear Sir:I have just received a copy of the enclosed letter from the previous Vice ChiefofStaff, General Brown, to the President of NBC. This letter contains severalmisleadingstatements concerning the contents of the Geraldo Rivera October 25, 1988 showingeneral, and concerning myself and my church, the Temple of Set, in particular.While Irealize that this letter is now six months old, I would appreciate thesecorrections beingfiled with it so that, if used as the basis for further decisions, it does notcontinue toconvey inaccurate information.(1) No claim was made by Rivera [or myself] that the Army endorses Satanism.The Temple affirms that it is formally recognized by the United StatesGovernment,which it is as a tax-exempt church formally approved by the Internal RevenueService.While the Army does not “endorse” any religion, DA Pamphlet 165-13 doesrecognizethe existence of many unusual religions, Satanism among them. Under the name“Congregation of Set”, the Temple of Set is specifically mentioned in thispamphlet.[The Institute for the Study of American Religions, contractor for thatpamphlet, hassince developed a far more sophisticated file on the Temple of Set. For furtherinformation contact Rev. J. Gordon Melton, Director, TSAR, University ofCalifornia,Santa Barbara, CA 93106.](2) On page #2 of his letter, General Brown equates Satanism with “lawlessness”and “vandalism”. This nation’s two Satanic churches, the Temple of Set and theChurchof Satan, neither prescribe nor tolerate either lawlessness or vandalism bytheirmembers.(3) There is no graffiti by Satanists in the bunkers of either the GGNRA or thePresidio. For one thing, legitimate Satanists are not the type to deface publicbuildingswith graffiti. For another thing, authentic Satanic symbolism is both unique andprecise, and would be easily distinguishable from scrawlings by non-Satanistsinspiredby Hollywood monster-movie nonsense.- 351 -(4) The Temple of Set and the Church of Satan do not tolerate child abuse. TheSatanic religion respects children and does not harm them in any way. In fact,minorshave never been permitted to affiliate with the Temple or even to attend any ofitsfunctions. [This simply reflects the Temple’s policy that children should notreceivereligious indoctrination, but should rather be free to decide upon ametaphysicalorientation of their own upon reaching responsible adulthood.](5) For the record, I have yet to see any clear evidence that even a singlechild wasabused in the Presidio of San Francisco scandal. Until I see such evidence, Ithink it issimply one more incident of deliberately-inflamed hysteria in the nationwideepidemicof phony child-abuse witch-hunts which has caused so much damage over the lastfewyears.I appreciate General Brown’s affirmation that the Army is committed to affordingallsoldiers, including myself, the full privilege of their Constitutional rights.Since theGeraldo Rivera show, however, the CIDC has flagged my file, suspended mysecurityclearance, and conducted a criminal investigation of me for an alleged crimewhich wasclearly maliciously fabricated by an Army chaplain. I do not consider thistreatment,and the sheltering of the chaplain to date against accountability for hisactions, toconstitute the full privilege of my rights under the First and FourteenthAmendmentsto the Constitution. I await correction of this flagrantly unjust situation bytheDepartment of the Army at this time.Provided to General Brown in support of his letter was a “Point/Counterpoint”paper prepared by OCPA-MRD. This paper too contains significant misinformationconcerning myself and my religion which I could have corrected had the paperbeenstaffed through me. To be specific:Point/Counterpoint #1: For me to claim U.S. Government recognition of theTemple of Set is not “specious”. As noted above, the Internal Revenue Service -theagency of the United States Government which recognizes the legal standing ofchurches for purposes of tax-exempt certification, so recognized the Temple ofSet in1975.Point/Counterpoint #2: If the U.S. Army does not endorse any specific religiousgroup, then why does it commission and pay the salaries of chaplains, who areservingofficially as representatives and promoters of certain religious institutions?The U.S.Army further funds the building and maintenance of Christian chapels on itsinstallations. I appreciate the fact that American society generally approves ofthisviolation of the church/state principle as a convenience to soldiers.Nevertheless it is infact a very tangible endorsement of Christianity by the Army.- 352 -The paper insists that DA Pamphlet 165-13 “is not designed to assist chaplainsinministering to the Satanic soldier, or any other soldier”. DA Training Circular16-24 (9June 1978) clearly establishes, however, that the Army does require commandersandchaplains to recognize and meet the needs of “less familiar religions” as wellasChristianity. To quote from this publication:The commander is responsible for the religious life of the command, whichincludesmeeting the religious needs of military personnel, their dependents, authorizedcivilians, and retired personnel and their dependents. The staff officerresponsible to thecommander for seeing that this is accomplished is the chaplain.Less familiar religions are included within this responsibility. The facilitiesprovidedby the commander should be made available to all religious groups for use asneeded.Normal participation gives priority in scheduling to General Protestant andCatholicservices. Other religious groups are accommodated in a cooperative manner so astobest meet the needs of all.The chaplain can neither be required to perform any task which conflicts withtherequirements of his/her own religious denomination, nor to participate in orconduct aservice in conflict with his/her beliefs. However, the recognition of religiousneeds ofothers and the effort to meet these needs in terms of facilities, personnel, andplanningis a responsibility of the chaplain.Point/Counterpoint #3: The paper casually equates “devil worship” with“lawlessness” - obviously an equation upon which General Brown relied whendraftinghis letter to NBC. As noted above, this is non-factual and a prejudicialstatementagainst the Satanic religion and its adherents.Point/Counterpoint #4: As noted above, there is no genuine Satanic graffiti ineither Presidio or GGNRA bunkers.Point/Counterpoint #5: “Joseph” is actually Captain Lewis D. Seago, USAR, aformer member of the Temple of Set who was expelled from it for misconduct in1982.At the time Seago, whose identity was concealed by Rivera, made his statement oncamera, he knew full well that no “Satanic organizations had been active on thePresidio”. Following Seago’s expulsion, I was the only member of the Temple ofSet onthe Presidio, and no activities of the Temple of Set were conducted on post. [Ontheevening that the Rivera broadcast aired and I first heard Seago’s statements, Iimmediately telephoned Colonel Rafferty and communicated this information tohim.Rafferty told me that Captain Seago had not identified himself to him norcleared thecontent of his statements with him.]In fact the October 25, 1988 Geraldo Rivera broadcast contained far more errorsthan the position paper provided to General Brown identified. Enclosed is ananalysisof that broadcast prepared by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism,- 353 -together with a copy of my own commentary on that analysis. I think you willfind thata far different picture of the subject emerges from that which Rivera tried tosell.As the senior representative of the Satanic religion as well as a commissionedofficerin the Army, I respectfully request that official Army statements concerningthisreligion be staffed through me for comment before being finalized by theDepartmentof the Army. I am interested not only in ensuring that our religion is describedaccurately, but also in enabling the Army to respond to questions concerning itasaccurately as it does to questions concerning more familiar religions, which Ipresumeare staffed through representatives of those religions in the Corps ofChaplains.Under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, I further request thatcopies of any other correspondence or other papers concerning myself, the TempleofSet, and/or the Satanic religion generally being maintained by your office beprovidedto me. My interest in reviewing such material is, as above, to correct anymisinformation contained therein.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military Intelligencecc- General Carl E.

Purpose. To inform the Director of the Army Staff of the status of LTCMichaelAquino and the options available to deal with him and other Army members whopractice satanic worship.2. Background. On 25 October 1988 LTC Michael Aquino appeared on an NBC specialconcerning satanism which focused, in part, on alleged satanic worship practicesat ornear the Presidio. LTC Aquino is an AGR Civil Affairs officer who was formerlystationed at the Presidio but is currently assigned to ARPERCEN. During hisinterviewwith the narrator, LTC Aquino acknowledged that he is an Army officer but statedthathe does not view his satanic worship as conflicting with his status as anofficer. Thenarrator implied through misstatements and, innuendoes that satanic rituals werebeing performed on Army bases, that child abuse was involved, and that the Armycondoned such practices. PAO182 prepared-a point paper (Tab A) and issued anARNEWS message (Tab B) rebutting each misstatement and clarifying the Army’sposition.3. Discussion.a. Status of LTC Aquino (BIO at Tab C).(1) He has been on continuous active duty as an AGR183 officer since 1981. Hewascommissioned as an Armor officer (ROTC-DMG184 ) in 1968, serving on active duty(including Vietnam) until July 1972 and in USAR units from 1973 to 1981. Hebranchtransferred to Civil Affairs in 1981.182 Department of the Army Public Information Office.183 Active Guard and Reserve, a highly-selective full-time active duty programfor Reserve/NationalGuard soldiers.184 ROTC Distinguished Military Graduate. A designation awarded to only a veryfew top ROTCcadets, commissioning them in the Regular Army rather than the Army Reserve, onpar with WestPoint graduates.- 355 -(2) He converted to satanic worship in the early 70s185 and later formed his ownsatanic church, the Temple of Set, which was granted tax exempt status as avalidreligious organization by the IRS in June 1976. 186(3) As Tab D reflects, various individuals in the Army have been aware of hissatanic worship activities and ideas since 1972187 , when he provided a Churchof Satan“position paper” to, a chaplain at the US Army Chaplain school. He later wroteto theOffice of the Chief of Chaplains in 1982 to correct what he believed weremisstatementsin DA Pam 165-13 concerning satanic worship.188 He has also appeared on other TVshows and in magazine articles (Tab D and Tab E).(4) He graduated from the ICAF resident course in 1987, after beingrecommended by a USAR SSC189 board in 1986. His OMPF190 has apparently neverreflected his satanic worship practices or ideas; on the contrary, his OMPF issuperlative in every respect. 191 It appears that the Chief, Army Reserve, wasbriefed onLTC Aquino’s satanic worship before the SSC board recommendation was approved(Tab E).(5) He currently has 11 years of active duty (for retirement under 10 USC 3911)and 20 “good years” for retirement under 10 USC 1331 (i.e., pay begins at age60). He is185 Correctly: 1969, when I joined the Church of Satan. However I did not“convert” from anything,never having been a member of any other religion previously.186 Correctly: The Temple of Set was founded in June 1975, California Statetax-exemption in October1975, federal tax-exemption in June 1976.187 Correctly: Since I joined the Church of Satan in 1969, all of my commanderswere aware of myreligion. In addition to numerous local & regional newspaper & broadcastinterviews, I was profiled inthe 6/19/72 issue of Time magazine: “The Occult: A Substitute Faith”. Uponleaving my assignmenton the faculty of the U.S. Army Armor School later that year, I was presentedofficially with [another]Army Commendation Medal and unofficially with an elegant Sikh dagger “to be usedfor sacrificingvirgins, if you can still find any”!188 This letter appears as Appendix #43.189 Senior Service College, the highest and most exclusive level of professionaleducation in theDepartment of Defense. Only one U.S. Army Reserve officer is selected for eachyear’s IndustrialCollege of the Armed Forces (ICAF) class, and I was that officer for the Classof 1987.190 Official Military Personnel File.191 Why would “superlative military performance in every respect” be contrary toSatanic religion? A"},{"pageContent":"clearly prejudicial statement.- 356 -42 years old and has an MRD192 of 13 July 1996 for years of service. His DOR193as LTCis 13 June 1985. He has a TS194 clearance, which was issued in 1981 andvalidated in1986, with full knowledge of his satanic worship. DIS195 has cleared him forSCI.196(6) His AGR status will be routinely reviewed by a “continuation board” inJanuary 1989. The board is required to retain him in an AGR status if he is“fullyqualified” and a position is available (which it is; he is in it). Otherwise, byregulationhe can only be REFRAD197 by DAADB198 procedures for misconduct, moral orprofessional dereliction or substandard performance of duty. The Secretary oftheArmy retains plenary authority under 10 USC 681 to REFRAD him in the bestinterestsof the Army.(7) There have been numerous Congressional inquiries, principally the routineforwarding of letters from constituents who were reacting to the misstatementsandinnuendoes made on the 25 October NBC show. The only non-routine letter is atTabF.199b. Options for dealing with LTC Aquino and other Army members who profess orpractice satanic worship.(1) If his actual conduct constitutes a UCMJ offense (including “conductunbecoming”) or moral or professional dereliction or substandard performance ofduty,then judicial, nonjudicial, or adverse administrative action (e.g., LOR200 ) canbe taken,as well as follow-on actions such as REFRAD or discharge if warranted. AlthoughtheSecretary could exercise his plenary authority to REFRAD LTC Aquino, there wouldhave to be a clearly articulated basis for doing so in the best interest of theArmy.192 Mandatory Retirement Date.193 Date of Rank.194 Top Secret, the highest category of security clearance.195 The Defense Investigative Service, which conducts background investigationsfor securityclearances.196 Special Compartmented Intelligence, extremely restricted and specializedaccess above Top Secret.I retained TS/SCI until my retirement in 1994.197 Relieved From Active Duty.198 Department of the Army Disciplinary Board.199 The 10/26/88 letter from Senator Jesse Helms’ office [see Chapter #6].200 Letter of Reprimand.- 357 -(2) LTC Aquino’s satanic worship has not apparently interfered with his dutyperformance, nor has he made a statement which would suggest a potentialconflict.The CID initiated an inquiry into allegations that LTC Aquino was involved inchildabuse at the Presidio, but held its inquiry in abeyance pending action by bothfederaland San Francisco authorities. The CID initiated a formal investigation (SSI),with LTCAquino listed as a suspect, on 23 November 1988.(3) His appearance on TV shows and in magazine interviews have apparentlybeen during his off-duty time, not at government expense, and not in hisofficialcapacity or in uniform. As such, his actions are protected by the FirstAmendment,from the perspective of both free speech and free exercise of religion.(4) Part of the Army’s current concern stems from the narrator’s misstatementsand innuendoes rather than from LTC Aquino’s statements. PAO has prepared aletterfrom VCSA to the President of NBC expressing his disappointment over the show’smisstatements and innuendoes (Tab G). 201c. Satanic worship by Air Force and Navy members. The Navy has not had anyrecent incidents involving satanic worship. Approximately 3-4 years ago, therewas analleged satanic ritual funeral performed for a deceased sailor. The Air Force iscurrentlyreviewing a request by a satanic worship group that has requested permission touse abase chapel to conduct services. 2024. Recommendations.a. Do not issue “top down” guidance to ARPERCEN or the continuation boardconcerning LTC Aquino. 203b. Avoid any perception of command influence in the criminal allegations againstLTC Aquino. Allow CID to continue its inquiry; allow the local command todeterminewhether charges should be preferred and an Article 32 investigation conducted.204c. Do not eliminate DA Pam 165-13 and DA Pam 165-13-1 which describe satanism,along with other little known “religions”, for informational purposes.d. Reply to Congressional inquiries by providing a copy of the ARNEWS release.201 Appendix #40.202 Neither of these incidents involved the Temple of Set.203 Such instructions were in fact illegally issued to the AGR continuationboard, as discussed inChapter #8.204 As the chapters dealing with the CID investigation and post-investigationconduct by the CID andTJAG show, this “Information Paper” proposal was ignored.- 358 -Appendix 43: Letter, Michael Aquino tothe Chief of Chaplains 4/15/82Department of the ArmyHeadquarters, Presidio of San FranciscoPresidio of San Francisco, California 94129AFZM-DRCS15 April 1982Chaplain (Colonel) John J. HooglandDirector, Personnel and Ecclesiastical RelationsOffice of the Chief of ChaplainsHeadquarters, Department of the ArmyWashington, D.C. 20310Dear Chaplain Hoogland:I was recently contacted by Chaplain (Colonel) Meredith R. Standley, CommandChaplain at Fort Ord, for information concerning the Church of Satan and TempleofSet. Chaplain Standley alerted me to the existence of DA Pamphlet 165-13ReligiousRequirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups, a copy of which Isubsequently obtained from the Sixth Army Chaplain. The sections in thispublicationdealing with the Church of Satan, Satanism, and witchcraft in general containvariousfactual errors. Chaplain Standley recommended that I forward my comments to youforpossible incorporation in changes to or future editions of this publication.Thesecomments are enclosed. All points contained therein are backed by personalexperienceand/or sound research practices. (I hold a Ph.D. from the University ofCalifornia,which should attest to my research capabilities.)I see no need to include a description of the Temple of Set in a revised 165-13,as ourbeliefs and practices do not interface or conflict with the professionalpractices andexpectations of the armed forces. There are no services that the Corps ofChaplains canperform for the Temple of Set other than to verify to commanders that it is alegally-incorporated and state/federally tax-exempt religious institution (which you canverifythrough the Internal Revenue Service).On the general subject of Satanism and Black Magic, I recommend that the CorpsofChaplains discourage military personnel from involvement with groups ororganizations other than the Temple of Set. This recommendation is not bornsimply ofa desire for sectarian monopoly. In 14 years I have seen the rise and fall ofinnumerable“Satanic” groups. The blunt truth of the matter is that virtually all of them -with the- 359 -significant exception of the pre-1975 Church of Satan and post-1975 Temple ofSet -ultimately proved to be excuses for drug abuse, sexual exploitation, orfinancial rackets.Warning soldiers against such hazards does not, in my opinion, abuse theirfreedom ofreligion as much as it evidences concern for their personal health and safety.Often bythe time an individual learns the truth in such cases, he is involved to anawkward andeven dangerous degree.We have found, moreover, that exposure to the theories and practices of BlackMagiccan be highly disturbing and traumatic to immature individuals. Consequently theTemple of Set screens applications carefully and introduces new members toconceptsonly as they demonstrate their ability to understand and apply them withintelligenceand judiciousness. We feel most strongly that any approach to the Black Artswhichdoes not evidence extraordinary care in this area is unethical andirresponsible.I myself am the senior member of the Priesthood in the only legally-recognized(through non-profit incorporation and full tax-exemption) “Satanic” (we preferthenon-Christian term “Setian”) religious institution in the United States. Assuch, and asan Army officer of 14 years’ Active and Reserve service, I would be pleased toassist theCorps of Chaplains with questions which may arise in this area.

Standley- 360 -Appendix 44: Letter, Michael Aquino toCaptain Mark Harvey 1/5/89January 5, 1989Dear Captain Harvey:In your December 14, 1988 letter you said: If Lt. Colonel Aquino providescertainleads or evidence that shows the allegations to be without merit, I will ensurethatUSA CIDC personnel follow those leads, to the maximum possible extent, in ordertoproperly document his innocence.Following is a list of such leads. The manner in which these are followed up bytheCID will be of considerable interest to me in ascertaining how objective yourinvestigation is. Therefore I request that you keep me, through Captain Hayes oftheTrial Defense Service, advised on the steps which are in fact being taken topursuethese leads.Five months elapsed from the time I preferred court-martial charges againstAdams-Thompson until they were dropped by the 25th Division. During that timeapparentlythe only “investigation” which was done of the principal specification (#1) wastocomment that “Adams-Thompson was just repeating what his stepdaughter toldhim” [and therefore he is innocent of any malicious act]. If your investigatorsare goingto proceed from the naïve assumption that Army chaplains are incapable of lying,andthat whatever Kinsey Almond is alleged to have said could not possibly have beentheinvention of her stepfather, mother, and/or Debbie Hickey, then I would haveseriousreservations about your ability to deal with a case such as the Presidioscandal. As Ihave documented to you, the nationwide epidemic of such scandals is notoriousfor thedeliberate indoctrination of children by parents, investigators, and“therapists” out ofdesires for career advancement, financial profit, media glamor, and/or personalvendettas. If the CID understands this, then there shouldn’t be any greatmystery aboutthe Presidio affair. If you don’t understand it, then you will simply be dupesfor thosewho created, aggravated, and are still attempting to exploit the scandal fortheirpersonal advantage and profit.I have one further comment to make before going into the leads, and I ask thatyouconsider it carefully:Unlike the Adams-Thompsons and the other Presidio witch-hunters, I have noinvestment in the Presidio scandal. I do not stand to realize millions ofdollars in claimsmoney, nor suffer the consequences of having perpetrated a cruel hoax on thePresidiocommunity, nor be responsible for the indoctrination of scores of infants andchildren- 361 -into lurid sex fantasies which they can scarcely begin to comprehend, nor beresponsible for ruining the lives and careers of innocent victims ofallegations. My wifeand I were minding our own business when Adams-Thompson suddenly attacked usout of nowhere. On the excuse of his allegations, we were then set upon savagelyby anofficer of the San Francisco Police Department which, as we later learned to oursurprise, had allowed another officer to pursue a covert campaign of defamationagainst us for several years.Defending ourselves against this unexpected, unprovoked, undeserved, and viciousattack has now cost us over $50,000 in legal fees and vandalism repairs to date.It hasseriously affected our health. It has seriously shaken the trust and confidencewepreviously had in “investigative” agencies. While I would like to believe, asyou told me,that the CID is a disinterested, objective, fact-finding body, I will need tosee a lot morethan sham investigations [of Adams-Thompson], stonewalled FOIA requests [forinformation crucial to the proof of our innocence], and prejudicial statementsto thepress by national CID officials to take you at your word. If it appears that youareindeed investigating objectively, then I will cooperate with you as much aspossible. Butif it appears that you are merely operating from a hidden agenda to persecute mywifeand myself regardless of the truth, I will certainly not cooperate with that.1. Find out if there is any record of the Adams-Thompsons taking theirstepdaughterto Letterman Army Medical Center (LAMC) in September/October 1986 fortreatment for any physical symptom significant of rape and sodomy by two adultmales. If there is no such record, then it is obvious that at the time inquestion theyhad no reason whatever to think that any sexual abuse as later alleged by theminAugust 1987 had happened to the child.2. Get the record of the January 1987 FBI interview with Kinsey Almond/AdamsThompson, in which there was no conclusion of sex-abuse, and compare itto the later “Mikey/Shamby” story produced after the four “therapy” sessions inFebruary 1987. Why should the “therapy” story be considered more credible thanthe earlier FBI interview results, given the reputation of such “therapists” formanufacturing fake “sex-abuse symptoms”?3. Find out if there is any record of the Adams-Thompsons taking theirstepdaughterto LAMC for medical examination in January 1987 after she denied to the FBIinterviewer that she had been molested by anyone. If there is no such record,thenit is obvious that even after the Presidio scandal had been set in motion andKinseyAlmond had been interviewed, the Adams-Thompsons still didn’t think that anysexual abuse as later alleged by them had happened to the child.4. Find out if, after the child had been subjected to “therapy” indoctrinationinFebruary 1987 by Debbie Hickey, the Adams-Thompsons then took the child to- 362 -LAMC for a physical examination. Obtain the results of any such medicalexamination and have them assessed by an expert pediatrician such as Ann Parker,M.D. (who was interviewed as an expert in the KTVU television documentary onthe Presidio scandal). If no such examination occurred, then it would be obviousthat even after the “therapy” sessions the Adams-Thompsons still didn’t thinkthatany sexual abuse (i.e. the double rape and double sodomy supposedly revealed bythe “therapy” sessions) had in fact happened to the child.5. Obtain written records of all four of the Hickey “therapy” sessions inFebruary 1987and see how consistent they are with one another, and to what extent the “Mikey/Shamby” story was created and progressively indoctrinated by Hickey as opposedto being later invented or embellished by Lawrence and/or Michele Adams-Thompson. Investigate the background of Hickey as to her license, professionalqualifications, and reputation as an automatic abuse-finder in childcare witch-hunts. Consider the possibility that, in order to protect himself/herself, thetherapist may have altered these “therapy” records at a later date. Investigatewhether Hickey has attended “how to create child-abuse scandals” workshops withleading profiteers such as Catherine Gould.6. I understand that the phrase “Mikey likes it” was a popular televisionadvertisement phrase, and I have seen it nowadays on stickers, buttons, andcarwindow ornaments. Review children’s television shows, comics, etc. of the1985-86 era to see if there was a cartoon character, super-hero, animal, etc.named“Shamby”. Find out whether there are any records of these names appearing inother Hickey therapy-stories.7. Provide copies of the FBI interview and the four “therapy” sessions to LeeColeman, M.D. for an expert opinion. Dr. Coleman is the Director of the Centerforthe Study of Psychiatric Testimony, 1889 Yosemite Road, Berkeley, CA 94707 -(415) 527-7512. Dr. Coleman is a nationally-famous authority on the use of quack“therapy” to manufacture child-abuse scares, and has been called to testify incourtas an expert witness in many scandals similar to that at the Presidio.8. Compare the records of the January FBI interview and the February 1987“therapy”sessions to the story told by Lawrence and Michele Adams-Thompson to FBISpecial Agent Clyde Foreman in August 1987 [after seeing Lilith and myself atthePresidio PX]. Obtain a copy of the report that Foreman presumably wrote withinthe FBI concerning the story told to him.9. What is the religious affiliation and history of Clyde Foreman? Is he aChristian ora member of the same church in which Adams-Thompson is an ordained minister?- 363 -10. Find out why, if the “Mikey/Shamby” therapist-story was indeed produced inFebruary 1987, the child was not taken immediately to Gary Hambright’s addressfor a possible house-identification. [The therapist-story was that the childsaid shewas taken to “Mr. Gary’s home”, not to someone else’s home.]11. Review the February 1986 Hickey “therapy” records to see if there is anydescription of a building besides “Mr. Gary’s home” given. [Consider that Hickeyorthe Adams-Thompsons may have doctored these records later in order to protectthemselves.] If Almond supposedly went into meticulous detail concerning theinterior of the building (“hardwood floors”), why not the color, shape, size,etc. ofthe exterior? Certainly this would have been of interest to an ethical therapisttrying to uncover a crime. What I expect you will find is that there was no suchdescription, because at that time it had not yet occurred to Adams-Thompson touse the story to attack my wife and myself.12. In August 1986 Adams-Thompson took his allegations against us immediately tothe FBI, which acted on them immediately, whereupon the SFPD actedimmediately. Yet the therapy story was developed in February (six monthsearlier). Did Adams-Thompson go running to the FBI at that time [rememberingthat the therapy-story named Hambright and Hambright’s home]? Did the FBItake Almond on an “identification ride” to Hambright’s residence at that time?Didthe SFPD obtain and execute a search warrant on Hambright’s residence seekingthe same list of “features detailed by Almond” that appeared six months later onthe SFPD report and search warrant used against us? I suspect you will find thatnone of this happened.13. Investigate the supposed “identification trip” to our San Francisco home. Isthereany verifiable record of Almond having described the color, size, shape, orlocationof a building before the trip was made? Why wasn’t she driven to the block onwhich Hambright’s residence was located? Why wasn’t she driven to various cityblocks at random and given an opportunity to “identify” a building? Exactly whosaid that Almond “identified” our building? Is it in an official FBI report, ordidMichele Adams-Thompson just allege this later to the SFPD? According to theSFPD report, the “identification” was made while walking the child past ourbuilding. Obviously this increases the opportunity for prompting or coaching astothat specific building, whose address both Foreman and Michele Adams-Thompson knew beforehand. Why not just stop the car at a “neutral” location onthe street and ask Almond if anything there was familiar to her?14. Once Almond had allegedly “identified” our building, why was the child notimmediately interviewed in depth concerning specific interior features of thepremises which could be verified upon a search by authorities? For example: “Didyou go upstairs or downstairs [it is obviously a multistory apartmentbuilding]?”- 364 -“What does the entrance way look like, and what color is it?” “What did theroomslook like?” If Almond had in fact been there before, all such details could haveserved to validate a search - or to further invalidate it. What happened is thatthere was no attempt to obtain further details from Almond before going aheadwith the search. As far as I am concerned, the reason for this is that SandiGallantand Glenn Pamfiloff simply wanted an excuse to get inside our home andconfiscate Temple of Set papers, and the fewer inconvenient facts which mightgetin their way, the better. The “interior description” was deliberately left asvague aspossible, so that a mismatch would not come back to haunt them any more thannecessary. [Even so, the mismatch is obvious.]15. Find out why, when the U.S. Attorney’s Office issued its multipleindictmentsagainst Gary Hambright for doing terrible things to multitudes of Presidiochildren, the Adams-Thompson allegation was not taken seriously enough to beincluded. Whether or not my wife and I or anyone else was involved, the“therapy”story clearly named “Mr. Gary” and his house. Michele Adams-Thompson haspublicly criticized the Army investigators for their “mishandling” of theallegationsagainst us, so it wouldn’t seem that the Adams-Thompsons would have balked athaving Kinsey Almond included on the list of offenses for which Hambright wascharged. According to the original therapy-story, the double rape and doublesodomy had been done at his home, and he had been one of the rapists/sodomizers. So why was a charge which the Adams-Thompsons now feel isappropriate to make against my wife and myself not equally appropriate to makeagainst Hambright? If they tried to make it, why wasn’t it accepted as one oftheindictments?16. It has been reported in the media that the Adams-Thompsons have kept thechildin continuous “therapy” since they made their attack on my wife and myself.Investigate how they selected the “therapist”, what the reputation of that“therapist” is as a professional abuse-finder, and what monetary benefits accruetothat “therapist” both from the clients and from outside private & governmentalgrants based on “child-abuse” cases opened. Obtain copies of any written reportsby that “therapist” and compare them with (a) the January 1987 FBI interview,(b)the February 1987 “therapist” reports, and (c) with information concerning mywife, myself, and the appearance of our home to which the Adams-Thompsonswere exposed after the August 1987 raid (either by police/FBI/CID contact or bythe extensive public media coverage of ourselves and our home).17. I recommend that CID agents investigate the past sexual histories ofLawrenceThompson and Michele Adams, including interviewing their previous marital andextramarital sex partners as discovered. If Kinsey Almond is being interviewed,question her as to whether she was ever sexually touched or molested by eitherhermother, her stepfather, or another immediate family member.- 365 -18. Find out what church Lawrence Adams-Thompson is ordained by, what hispersonal record in that church is, what that church’s official position towardsSatanand Satanism is, and what it expects its ministers or priests to do about“Devil-worship”.19. Find out why, in conducting a five-month preliminary inquiry into the court-martial charges I preferred against Adams-Thompson, neither BrigadeCommander Colonel Sierra, nor any representative of his, nor the CID (which wassupposedly investigating the charges for Sierra) ever once contacted either mywifeor myself to discuss any of the details of our sworn statements.20. Find out why the San Francisco Police Department has refused to return therest ofour personal and church property seized in the August 1987 raid, despite thefactthat nothing contained in it is evidence of anything the least criminal,child-abuserelated or otherwise, and despite the fact that the District Attorney closed theinvestigation of us without filing any charges. [I am entirely willing for thatremaining confiscated property to be examined by CID investigators.]21. Contact Ms. Irene F. Rapoza, Senior Administrative Analyst, Office ofCitizenComplaints, San Francisco Police Commission, 555 Seventh Street #252, SanFrancisco, CA 94103, telephone (415) 553-1407 and request access to a copy ofherforthcoming investigative report on case #0468-88. This is the complaint which Ifiled against SFPD officers Sandi Gallant and Glenn Pamfiloff for abuse of theiroffices in violation of the Temple of Set’s and its members’ Constitutionalrights,defamatory statements and actions against me, and use of the Adams-Thompsonallegations as a mere excuse to terrorize my wife and myself and confiscate andretain personal and church material having no relation to any criminal activitywhatever.22. What are the religious affiliations and histories of all CID special agentsassigned tothe investigation of me? Are any of them Christians, or members of the samechurch in which Adams-Thompson is an ordained minister? If any of this is thecase, what steps have been taken to verify their ability to be objective in theinvestigation of a Satanist and head of the nation’s preeminent Satanic church?[Concerning the Presidio Child-Care Scandal investigation generally]:1. Find out who the Presidio chaplain was who initially [in October/November1986]advised Captain and Mrs. Tobin to go to the authorities with an allegation ofchildsex-abuse. Was it by any chance Adams-Thompson?2. Find out what roles Lawrence and Michele Adams-Thompson each played inaggravating the rumors and hysteria in the subsequent Presidio scandal.- 366 -3. Find out why, after the Tobins’ initial accusations of anal rape with “tears”hadbeen retracted by Dr. Kevin Coulter, the allegations made against Hambrightconcerning the Tobin child were switched to “oral copulation” - which wasapparently never mentioned at the time of the initial allegations. Is thisanotherinstance where the “crime” is hastily reinvented when the initial accusation isfound to be false? Unlike anal rape, of course, “oral copulation” cannot beprovedor disproved by medical examination, and thus is all the more convenient for“therapists” as an allegation.4. Find out how many parents actually took their children to LAMC for medicalexaminations for any physical problems which could have been sex-abuse-relatedat the time such abuses are now alleged to have occurred - not monthslater when the witch-hunt was set in motion. Investigate the results of thosepre-scandal examinations, if indeed any actually occurred.5. Under separate cover I am sending you copies of the following two books:• Mary Pride, The Child Abuse Industry (Westchester, IL: Crossway Books, 1986).• Paul & Shirley Eberle, The Politics of Child Abuse (Secaucus, Lyle Stuart,1986)These books document the ongoing national “child-abuse industry” series ofmanufactured day-care scandals, and the exploitation of the concept of “therapy”for personal gain. If you do not read them, you are investigating in the dark.6. Take the time to read thoroughly Attachment #A ( Commercial Appeal,Memphis, Tennessee, January 17-22, 1988) to my sworn statement of 23 August1988. Judging by what I have seen so far, your investigation of the Presidioaffairseems to be proceeding in ignorance of the history and character of the ongoingfake child-care/child-abuse epidemic.7. Under separate cover I am sending you the section of Arthur Lyons’ SatanWantsYou: The Cult of Devil Worship in America (New York: Mysterious Press, 1988)discussing the idiotic allegations that Satanists molest/abuse/sacrifice/breed/etc.children. It exposes the religious hate-group network around the country whichhas seized upon such allegations as an opportunity for attacking the legitimateSatanic religion.8. Contact FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kenneth Lanning, FBI Academy, Quantico,Virginia for information as to whether any legitimate Satanist church such astheTemple of Set or Church of Satan has ever been involved in child-abuse crime.Lanning is the FBI’s principal expert on the subject of Satanism and “Sataniccrime”. Note that the Temple of Set has been in existence since 1975, and theChurch of Satan since 1966, and that thousands of individuals have come and gonefrom these organizations in these 22 years. If they were engaged in sexual abuseorother criminal acts towards children, it would certainly have surfaced longbefore- 367 -now. [Lanning is a considerably more reliable source of information on thissubjectthan Geraldo Rivera, I might add.]9. Examine the allegations by parents and “therapists” from the standpoint ofmonetary motives. The parents who are anxious to prove some kind of molestationhave a $66 million stake from the federal government in doing so. They may alsobe able to get thousands of additional dollars from the Crime Victim’sCompensation law in California. As for “therapists”: The 1974 Mondale Actprovided for huge federal grants to states if they passed mandatory child-abusereporting laws, which they proceeded to do. California’s law became effective in1981. In order to receive this money, state and local child-abuse protectiveserviceagencies are under constant pressure to generate as many new cases as possible.The manufacture of child-abuse cases is now a very big and lucrative business.10. Investigate the professional backgrounds and credentials of every“therapist” whohas been involved in the Presidio scandal [if in fact there were more than justHickey]. This profession is nationally notorious for slack or nonexistentcredentialing procedures, and many individuals represent themselves as“therapists” or “family counselors” who have little or no accredited training inthefield. In California, the practicing of “therapy” without a license is only amisdemeanor.

Many non-medical-degreed “psychologists” specializing in the “child-abusefinding” field have similarly-questionable backgrounds and credentials, and aresimply interested in the financial profits to be made. Checklists of “Satanicritualabuse symptoms”, such as that circulated at the Presidio in the developingstages ofthe scandal, are simply geared towards the generation of new business, in thattheycite almost any ordinary behavior of a child as “evidence of abuse”.

Aquino, want to make the following statementunder oath:I. CID questions. [CID questions are in Italics. My sworn answers are in regulartype.]1. Please give the dates and addresses when LTC and Mrs. Aquino lived in SanFrancisco in approximate terms.1. 123 Acme Avenue was originally purchased by my grandfather, Dr. CampbellFord, in 1921, and it was my home from birth in 1946 until 1961, when I movedto Santa Barbara with my father. My mother, Mrs. Betty Ford, inherited theproperty and resided there until her death in December 1985. When I wascommissioned in the Regular Army in 1968, 123 Acme became my legal home ofrecord, although with my military and subsequent civilian assignments Iresided in other locations. In September 1980, following completion of myPh.D. degree in Santa Barbara, Lilith and I moved to 123 Acme and residedthere until 20 July 1986, when we moved to Washington, D.C. for my residentattendance at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. We returned to live at123 Acme Avenue in early August 1987. We resided there until 1 September1987, when we returned to St. Louis and I reported to my present assignment.2. Specifically, provide the dates when LTC and Mrs. Aquino were in SanFrancisco between January 1986 and July 1987. The period from May 1, 1986to August 31, 1986 is particularly critical. 3. If not in San Francisco, pleaseprovide the location and a method of verifying the location of LTC and Mrs.Aquino between January 1986 and July 1987.2-3. To this date I have not been advised of any specific date or time when, orlocation where I am alleged to have committed any alleged crime beinginvestigated by the CID. I am advised by Captain Thomas Hayes of the U.S.Army Trial Defense Service that to volunteer the answers to questions #2 and#3 is inappropriate unless the CID informs me of such a specific allegation andthe specific date/time/location involved. I will then respond to the best, of myinformation concerning my location and activities at the specific point in time.4. Please have the Aquinos sign a consent for the USA CIDC to obtain theirfinancial records for 1986.- 370 -4. At this time Mrs. Aquino and I do not consent to the CID obtaining ourpersonalfinancial records, as we would consider it an unwarranted and unnecessaryinvasion of our personal privacy. If the CID informs me of the specific date/time/location of any specific allegation, I will be willing to provide copies ofmyfinancial records for that specific date to the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service,Presidio of San Francisco. The CID will then be welcome to examine thoserecords in the Trial Defense Service office, but not to copy or remove them.5. In 1986 did LTC Aquino have any pictures of lions in his home at 123 AcmeAvenue, San Francisco?5. No. And if the Hickey “therapy” account was of “a bathtub with lion’s feet”,I donot see why that should be arbitrarily extended or generalized into “pictures oflions in my home”.6. In 1986 did LTC Aquino have a bathtub with lion’s feet in his home at 123AcmeAvenue, San Francisco?6. No. The bathtub is a built-in model, flush to the walls and floor, and ismodemin style. It was installed at some point prior to 1980 by my mother, who livedinthe flat through 1985. The bathtub is shown on camera in the KTVU Channel #2television documentary Nightmare at the Presidio, broadcast 10 April 1988 inSan Francisco.7. In order to obtain suitable character references to ensure a balancedinvestigative report, please provide the name, address, and telephone numberof LTC Aquino’s five closest military friends in 1986.7. [Provided.]8. Please provide the name, address, and telephone number of LTC Aquino’s fiveclosest civilian friends in 1986.8. [Provided.]9. Provide the names, addresses, and phone numbers of as many witnesses aspossible (not more than 10) who have seen the inside of 123 Acme in 1986.9. The following individuals saw the flat regularly during January-July 1986:[Provided.]10a. On 4 January 1988 Lilith Aquino made a sworn statement to Major Berrythat indicated size had lived in Washington, D.C. with her husband from July- 371 -1986 until July 1987, when the Aquinos moved to St. Louis for LTC Aquino’sassignment to ARPERCEN. The sworn statement also denied that Kinsey[Almond - Adams-Thompson’s stepdaughter] was ever at her home or hadever been sexually assaulted by Mrs. Aquino. Mrs. Aquino’s statement deniedthat Mrs. Aquino was separated from LTC Aquino at the post exchange on 12August 1987 when viewed by Kinsey Adams-Thompson and Kinsey’s parents.Mrs. Aquino also denied that she had ever been known as “Shamby”. Is Mrs.Aquino’s statement true?10a. Lilith Aquino’s statement is true in all respects.10b. Can the Aquinos think of any other possible motive for the Adams-Thompsonsto lie other than religious differences?10b. There are at least two possible reasons for the Adams-Thompsons to haveliedat the time of their initial allegations:(1) Religious prejudice: It must be remembered that Lawrence Adams-Thompson is not just a Christian layman but an ordained minister whotakes his religion much more literally, passionately, and emotionally thanthe average person who considers himself a Christian. To such anindividual as Adams-Thompson, “Satan” represents everything he hatesand fears the most, and exists as a literal enemy rather than a merelysymbolic one. As the chief official of the world’s largest Satanic church, Iwould accordingly be an automatic object of his antagonism.As the type of woman who would marry a Christian minister, MicheleAdams-Thompson presumably shares this literal, fundamentalist approachto Christianity and religious prejudice against Satan and Satanism. The roleof Michele in this affair merits specific investigation:(a) Apparently Michele accompanied Kinsey to the Debbie Hickey“therapy” sessions in which sex abuse was alleged by Hickey. Accordingto Hickey’s notes, it was Michele (not the child or Hickey) who “raisedthe issue of a Satanic cult” into the “therapy” during the 2 June 1987session.(b) Hickey’s notes of the 30 June 1987 “therapy” session state that “Kinseyhad told her mother that Mikey wears an Army suit just like Daddy,with a stripe on the pants”. This appears to be Michele making astatement to Hickey, not a spontaneous, initial comment by the child.This suggests to me that by this date it had already occurred to Micheleto try to invent a story to involve the Presidio’s well-known Satanist- 372 -officer and his wife in the Presidio witch-hunt. [Note that “Satanicritual child abuse” has been a staple accusation - and an inevitablyunfounded one - of almost all of the child-care center witch-hunts sinceMcMartin.] Even if the Adams-Thompsons had not seen my wife andmyself in the PX in August, it is now apparent that they were planningto make allegations against us anyway, sooner or later, as the witch-hunt continued.(c) It is significant that, in the same 30 June 1987 “therapy” session,Hickey (not Michele) asked the child to pick out some officer rank, andthe child selected a Chief Warrant Officer 2 insignia. Hickey then askedthe child if she could remember a nametag, and the child said therewas one with the letters “AK”. Not anticipating that Hickey would askthese specific questions, Michele did not coach the child to select aLieutenant Colonel insignia or to know how to spell my name.(d) From Hickey’s notes of the “therapy” sessions, the “package”allegation-story does not appear as a single story in any session.Rather, over a 7-month period, a large grab-bag of fantastic,inconsistent, and incoherent stories was amassed. The story that theAdams-Thompsons told to the FBI on 13 August 1987 (FBI Form 302),after seeing my wife and myself in the Presidio PX, appears to havebeen a composite invented by them at that time to incorporate featuresfrom the therapy sessions that were least bizarre, to deliberately omitor change parts of these features which would lessen their credibility,and to invent other “accounts by the child” on their own initiative toreinforce the “package story”. [This 13 August 1987 FBI Form 302 isapparently the first time this “package story”, which was then given toSFPD Inspector Pamfiloff for his SFPD incident report, appearsanywhere.]For example [assuming that Kinsey Almond made statements asHickey’s notes claim]:• Kinsey told of being taken on several trips: one to “Gary and Sassy’sblue house” (7 April session), one to a “place with a blue swingset” (28 April), one to “Kathy’s house” (12 May), one to a “housewith real animals” (19 May), one to “Mr. Gary’s house” (2 June), andone to a “Dr. Steve’s house” (23 June). From this the Adams-Thompsons represented to the FBI and the SFPD only that Kinseyhad given a single, believable account of one trip to a specific house.- 373 -• Kinsey mentioned several people besides Gary Hambright:“Shamby/Sassy” who has alternately brown (28 April) and“poopoo”-colored (7 April) hair, “Toto” who has green hair (28 April& 12 May), “Kathy” who has blonde hair and works at the day-carecenter, “Mikey” who wears officer uniform with Chief WarrantOfficer 2 rank insignia and has a nametag with “AK” on it (30 June),an unnamed man “with hair on his face” (12 May), “Dr. Steve” (23June), and another unnamed man wearing a dress (19 May). Fromthis the Adams-Thompsons represented to the FBI and the SFPDonly that Kinsey had identified a single couple, “Mikey andShamby”, and that “Mikey” wore a dress. They did not mention anyfeature of either “Mikey” or “Shamby” which they knew to beinconsistent with the actual appearance of my wife or myself (haircolor, rank insignia, nametag letters, etc.). They did not mentionthat Kinsey had just as “credibly” mentioned someone with greenhair.• Kinsey mentioned several features of the house/houses to which shewas supposedly taken: the color is blue (7 April), the house isKathy’s (12 May), the house is Dr. Steve’s (23 June), the house has ablue swing set (28 April). Inside are real animals (19 May),dinosaurs that bit people (7 April), a golf book and golf balls (7April), a Bible with “poopoo on it” and a “bad” cross “that wentpeepee” (19 May), a bathtub with lion’s feet (2 June), a pot hangingfrom the ceiling with arms and legs hanging out of it (2 June), andthat Mr. Gary cut a baby open and that there were 4 brown andblack babies (10 August). From this the Adams-Thompsonsrepresented to the FBI and SFPD only that Kinsey had been taken toa house “with a cross on the ceiling and a bathtub with lion’s feet”.They omitted mention of all the other features. In their story to theFBI and SFPD they evidently invented the following additionalfeatures, which to my knowledge do not appear anywhere in the“therapy” notes: hardwood floors, a living room with black walls,and filming Kinsey with a movie camera. [As I have previously notedin my earlier sworn statements, it is ridiculous to suppose that a 2-year-old infant would recognize or recall things like hardwood floorsor a movie camera.]As discussed in the San Francisco Examiner series of stories on“child abuse” witchhunts, which appeared just prior to the outbreakof the Presidio witch-hunt, allegations that “Satanic rituals” areinvolved began with the book Michelle Remembers and weresensationally introduced into the McMartin witch-hunt. Thereafter- 374 -they became a staple of every copycat witch-hunt. Obviously Adams-Thompson saw an opportunity to victimize the Presidio’s well-known Satanist officer and his wife in the Presidio witch-hunt whenhe saw us at the PX, and did so.(2) As a means for the Adams-Thompsons to divert attention and suspicionfrom themselves if either of them had been sexually maltreating the child inany way. David Finkelhor, Associate Director of the Family ViolenceResearch Program at the University of New Hampshire, has written inChild Sexual Abuse: New Theory & Research that:The background factors most strongly associated with sexualvictimization involved characteristics of the child’s parents. For example,having a stepfather, one of the strongest risk factors, more than doubled agirl’s vulnerability. Virtually half the girls with stepfathers were victimizedby someone. Moreover this risk factor remained the strongest correlate ofvictimization, even when all other variables were statistically controlled.Victimized girls were much more likely to have mothers who werepunitive about sexual matters. These girls warned, scolded, and punishedtheir daughters for asking sex questions, for masturbating, and for lookingat sexual pictures much more often than usual. A girl with a sexuallypunitive mother was 75% more vulnerable to sexual victimization than the“typical” girl in the sample. It was the second most powerful predictor ofvictimization, after having a stepfather, and was still highly significantwhen all other variables were controlled.At certain times in the past, moralists did express concern that childrenwere being sexually abused as a result, in their view, of the liberalization ofsexual values. Since they used the issue of child-molesting as a way ofcampaigning against other kinds of progressive reforms that most social-welfare professionals supported, the professionals tended to discount thesealarms. Moreover, in many respects the moralists were mistaken about theproblem, since they portrayed the greatest danger to children as comingfrom strangers and depraved individuals outside the family, not fromwithin the family where, as recently documented, the more serious threatis.Lawrence Adams-Thompson is the stepfather of Kinsey Almond. His wifeMichele’s assertive role in the marriage is suggested by her retention of hername “Adams” and the placement of it before Thompson’s name, as well asher being the one to regularly give statements to the media rather than herhusband. These statistical factors strongly suggest that, if Kinsey Almondhas ever actually been sexually abused, the possibility that it wasperpetrated within the family should be the initial focus of anyinvestigation.- 375 -It is Michele Adams-Thompson who apparently took Kinsey to the Hickey“therapy” sessions, and who brought up the subject of a “Satanic cult” intothose sessions (2 June). It is Michele who walked Kinsey past our SanFrancisco home for the “identification”. The account that “Mikey wears anArmy suit just like Daddy, with a stripe on the pants” is identified inHickey’s notes not as coming directly from Kinsey to Hickey, but rather asbeing told to Hickey by Michele. In one session Kinsey said to Hickey,“Don’t tell my dad.” [Why not?]After making the allegations, the Adams-Thompsons have several strongreasons to continue to he in support of them:(3) Reason #1 and possibly reason #2 as discussed above.(4) Their false accusations have caused intense, extended damage to aninnocent officer and his wife. If they now retract these accusations, theywould be publicly exposed as having taken advantage of the lynch-mobatmosphere of the Presidio child-care scandal to try to defame and destroythat officer and his wife simply out of religious bigotry and personalmaliciousness. Following the original SFPD raid on our home, the Adams-Thompsons had many opportunities to retract and apologize for the falseallegations they made if they had any interest in doing so. Despite theabundant facts which immediately came to light showing the allegations tobe conspicuously unsubstantiated (such as the completely incorrectdescription of the interior of our home), the Adams-Thompsons haveconsistently refused to retract or qualify their allegations in the least. Quitethe contrary, Michelle Adams-Thompson has publicly blamed the Army,the FBI, and the SFPD for the fact that there is no evidence we are guilty ofanything. In the 2 August 1988 San Jose Mercury News she said: “Thedistrict attorney’s decision not to file charges is certainly not surprising inlieu (sic) of how the authorities have bungled everything else. No oneagency has distinguished themselves (sic). It all seemed to be a really sadfailure of all agencies to do their jobs properly.”(5) As I believe a thorough investigation will show, it is out of the questionthatAdams-Thompson made his allegations against my wife and myself“innocently”.(a) Based upon all official and public reports to which I have had access todate, there is a clear record that at no time prior to his 12 August 1987attack on my wife and myself did Adams-Thompson take any actionswhich would show that he believed any September-October 1986double rape/sodomy of his stepdaughter by anyone to have actually- 376 -happened. [Examples would be taking the child to Letterman Hospitalfor a related emergency medical examination at that point in time, orSFPDIFBI/CID complaints by him dating to that period.](b) As shown in #10.b.(1)(d) above, the story the Adams-Thompsons gaveto the FBI and SFPD on 12 August was deliberately and knowinglyconstructed by them to falsely accuse my wife and myself, and to omitany information which might not support this attack. Even after theraid on our home and the subsequent media publicity given to theirfabricated story, the Adams-Thompsons remained silent about theelements of that story they had omitted, invented, and arbitrarilyconstructed - evidently in order to see my wife and myself furthermauled in the press, with the resultant vandalism, death-threats, andlegal difficulties with the SFPD which this entailed - to say nothing ofthe present CID investigation and the continuing disruption it hascaused to our lives. [Mrs. Aquino and I have now been living in acontinuous state of “criminal investigation” - and the consequent andrelentless media intrusion into our personal lives - for over 1-1/2years.]The conclusion necessarily to be drawn from this is that Adams-Thompson definitely knew his allegations were false when he madethem on 12 August 1987. This specific knowledge on his part is theessence of the court-martial charges I have preferred against him.Obviously he now has every possible reason to lie in support of theallegations he made, to keep from being court-martialed for hisdeliberately and intentionally malicious act.(6) Religious prejudice in the Army is a violation of law. A confirmed religiousdiscriminatory act by a commissioned officer would subject him todisciplinary action and possibly the loss of his commission. An act ofsufficient harm to an innocent party might additionally subject him toprosecution. [This is again the basis for the UCMJ charges which I havepreferred against Adams-Thompson.](7) I understand that Adams-Thompson was one of the original instigators ofthe entire Presidio child-care scandal. That witch-hunt has now causedserious harm to the individuals falsely accused during it, confusion and fearto many Presidio parents, psychological damage to many infant childrenwho have been subjected to exhaustive questioning on revolting subjectsand to “therapy” conditioning in lurid sexual fantasies, extensive disruptionto the entire Presidio community, and the enormous expenditure of time,manpower, and funds by the FBI, the San Francisco Police Department,- 377 -and the CID. If after all of this a human sacrifice cannot be found to justifythe witch-hunt, the inevitable conclusion will be that it was all a fraud fromthe very beginning - simply the latest outbreak in the national epidemic of“day-care sex-abuse” witch-hunts which has swept the country during thelast several years. That would change the public images of all of the witch-hunt leaders from crusaders and martyrs to callous, vindictiveopportunists. The blame might well be concentrated on whoever started thehysteria in the first place. If Adams-Thompson is indeed the chaplain whooriginally advised the Tobins to make their original allegation, that blamemight fail ultimately on him.(8) I understand that 22 Presidio families - including the Adams-Thompsons -have filed $66 million in damage claims against the U.S. Army for allegedharm to their children at the day-care center. If any of these claims aregranted, the parents may also be able to file additional monetary claimsunder California law. Obviously if the entire scandal is exposed as a fraud,with no evidence other than coached “therapy” by professional“molestation-finders” that anything ever happened to the children, theclaims will be unsupported and no one, including the Adams-Thompsons,will get a cent.On 15 March 1988 a $1.5 million claim against the government was filed,apparently by Adams-Thompson, as follows:[Name deleted in FOIA document] was sexually molested by GaryHambright, Michael Aquino, Lilith Aquino, and others who have yet to beidentified, while in the care and custody of the Presidio Child DevelopmentCenter. The molestation took place at 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco andprobably at the Child Development Center and possibly elsewhere.In addition to deliberately and knowingly telling a false “package story” tothe FBI and SFPD, therefore, Adams-Thompson has filed a fraudulentclaim against the government knowing that his allegations were merelyfabricated by himself and his wife. This is therefore a deliberate attempt onhis part to defraud the government.10c. Do the Aquinos know of anyone who has ever heard Adams-Thompsondenounce or criticize the Temple of Set?10c. We neither traveled in his social circles nor made any inquiries about himwhileI was assigned to the Presidio. If he made any defamatory statements againstourselves or our religion, he would have had to be very circumspect about doing- 378 -so. It is against Army Regulations for a chaplain to denounce a legitimatechurch. DA Training Circular 16-24, 9 June 1978, states:The commander is responsible for the religious life of the command, whichincludes meeting the religious needs of military personnel, their dependents,authorized civilians, and retired personnel and their dependents. The staffofficer responsible to the commander for seeing that this is accomplished is thechaplain.Less familiar religions are included within this responsibility. The facilitiesprovided by the commander should be made available to all religious groups foruse as needed. Normal participation gives priority in scheduling to GeneralProtestant and Catholic services. Other religious groups are accommodated in acooperative manner so as to best meet the needs of all.The chaplain can neither be required to perform any task which conflictswith the requirements of his/her own religious denomination, nor to participatein or conduct a service in conflict with his/her beliefs. However, therecognitionof religious needs of others and the effort to meet these needs in terms offacilities, personnel, and planning is a responsibility of the chaplain.The Temple of Set is one such Satanic church specifically identified [as the“Congregation of Set”] in DA Pamphlet 165-13, Religious Requirements andPractices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains, April 1978.This has put Christian chaplains in a very awkward position. Satan andSatanism stand for everything they consider most intolerable, yet they arerequired by the Army to tolerate and even assist legitimate Satanic soldiers inpracticing their faith.In theory this means that Satanist soldiers could request the use of a postchapelfor a Satanic Mass and expect help from the Christian chaplains in schedulingand decorating the facilities properly and in advertising the ceremony to thepost community. In practice, appreciating the commotion this would create, theTemple of Set and Church of Satan have never made such requests, but as adiplomatic courtesy have advised their military members to conduct theirmeetings and services in private facilities.The point here is that Adams-Thompson’s entire religious profession, which henecessarily considers as taking precedence over his military one, is dedicatedtodenouncing and criticizing Satan and Satanism - and to destroying them ifpossible. It is virtually impossible for him to teach a Bible class, preach asermon, or teach Sunday school without denouncing and criticizing the Devil inone way or another.This is a social situation in which Christian priests and ministers, trained andaccustomed to use the Devil as an acceptable object of hatred, have recentlybeen forced by Army Regulations and United States law to tolerate Satanism as- 379 -a religion of equal legitimacy and social respectability. Most chaplains haveendeavored to adjust to this requirement gracefully and professionally. Adams-Thompson is obviously one of those who hasn’t.11. Does LTC or Mrs. Aquino know of any person who would say that CPT or Mrs.Adams-Thompson had a bad reputation for truthfulness or give an opinionthat the Adams-Thompsons were untruthful?11. There are many people who are sufficiently well-acquainted with my wife andmyself to know that the Adams-Thompsons have lied flagrantly and persistentlyin their accusation against us. I have no knowledge of his or his wife’s havingareputation for lying prior to this. I have, however, not had any previous socialcontact with them, traveled in social circles where they were discussed, nor hadtheir previous history investigated.The day after we learned from the SFPD report that Adams-Thompson hadmade the accusation that resulted in the raid on our San Francisco home, mywife and I called upon the Deputy Presidio Commander Colonel D. PeterGleichenhaus (currently Inspector General, Headquarters, Sixth U.S. Army) toexpress our shock and anger. I recall that during that meeting ColonelGleichenhaus mentioned that the Adams-Thompsons had a turbulent personalhistory at the Presidio, but I cannot remember specifics. You may wish to askColonel Gleichenhaus about their background.12. In a letter dated 27 August 1987 to CPT Adams-Thompson, copy furnished toinvestigators and to the Commander, Presidio of San Francisco, LTC Aquinostated that the home at 123 Acme was closed up. Is this true? Was someone elseusing the home who could have brought children into the home without theknowledge of the Aquinos? Could you discuss whether it is possible thatsomeone could have used 123 Acme to sexually/ritualistically abuse children inthe absence of the Aquinos?12. As noted previously, 123 Acme is my wife’s and my legal home of record. Wekeep it fully furnished, with all the utilities on, and leave the bulk of ourbelongings there. As assigned elsewhere by the Army, we rent a local apartment,but plan to travel back to our San Francisco home occasionally during the yearfor vacationing and business.123 Acme is a building with one top flat (ours) and three smaller downstairsapartments which are rented out. When we moved to Washington in July 1986,we locked up the top flat. Prior to departing for such an extended period, wehadextra security features added, such as a solid-core, deadbolted back door(similar to the front one) and a security alarm system installed by National- 380 -Guardian Alarm and centrally monitored by them on a 24-hour basis from theirSan Francisco office. Any unauthorized entry into the flat would have triggeredthe monitoring service, resulting in a call to the police and our immediatenotification. There have been no unauthorized entries since the system wasinstalled.Mr. William Butch (Lt. Commander U.S. Navy Reserve), Lilith’s brother, and alieutenant in a commercial security service in San Francisco) lived in one ofthe123 apartments following our departure for Washington. After we departed forWashington, D.C. he supervised the building for us. He was given the key to theupstairs flat and the combination to the security system in case of anemergency.From June 1986 until early January 1987, contractor Graham Marshall paintedthe entire exterior of the 121-123 building complex. It took a long time becausehe worked singlehandedly for the most part. Because he spent much time onladders, scaffolding, and “bosun’s chairs” on the roof and over the sides of thebuilding, Mr. Butch habitually switched the upstairs flat alarm system off everymorning [and on every night] to prevent Marshall’s noise and impacts fromsetting off false alarms. [The system includes sound and vibration sensors.] Theflat remained deadbolted. Marshall did not have access to the interior afterJuly1986.There is no reason to suppose that any of the three lower apartments was usedfor sexual molestation or any other criminal purpose. Mr. Butch monitored thebuilding and its other tenants as necessary. They were respectable individualswho caused no problems or disturbances during their lease periods. None of theapartments has any of the features alleged by Adams-Thompson (such as lion’s-footed bathtubs, etc.). None of the other tenants had access to our flat.[This question returns again to 123 Acme as though there is probable cause tothink that these premises were involved in a crime. I accordingly wish to pointout again that the alleged “description” which Adams-Thompson invented wascompletely inaccurate, and that there is no supporting evidence whatever thatany crime involving anyone took place there. The inaccuracy of the alleged“description” shows clearly that it was merely fabricated by Adams-Thompson.]13a. On 4 January 1988 LTC Aquino made a five-page sworn statement to MAJBerry as support for the charges that were sworn by LTC Aquino. LTC Aquinodenied that Kinsey Almond -Adams Thompson’s stepdaughter] was ever at hishome or had ever been sexually assaulted by him. LTC Aquino also denied thathe had ever been known as “Mikey”. Are these statements true? Is thefollowing statement true (from 4 January 1988 sworn statement):- 381 -7. I have never had anything to do with either Kinsey M. Almond(Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s stepdaughter) or any other child involvedwith the Presidio daycare center. I have never molested any child in mylife. I have never used or been known by the nickname “Mikey”.13a. All of these statements are completely, absolutely, and wholly true. Iherebyswear to them again: I have never met Kinsey Almond/Adams-Thompson atany location at any time. I have never molested any child at the Presidio or offthe Presidio, nor taken any Presidio day-care child anywhere, nor arranged forany such child to be taken anywhere for any purpose whatever, molestation orotherwise. My entire life history attests to my integrity and decency, and thereisno principle in my religion which tolerates or advocates any harm to children orany abuse of them sexually.Throughout my childhood I was nicknamed “Archy” by my parents (todistinguish me from my father, whose first name is also “Michael”). “ArchyFord-Aquino” is the name on my 1960 grammar-school graduation records atthe Town School for Boys, 2750 Jackson Street, San Francisco. Since 1961 Ihave gone by my legal name of “Michael”, and personal friends call me that. Inthe Army, where nicknames are virtually mandatory, I am called “Mike”. No onehas ever called me “Mikey”. [I understand that the phrase “Mikey likes it”received considerable television and popular exposure in the last year or so,andthat may be where this name was picked out.]I further state that my wife Lilith Aquino has never used nor been called by thename “Shamby” [or “Sassy”], and I have known her since 1972. Her originalname was Patricia, and she is usually called “Pat” by her parents. She chose thename of “Lilith” for herself in 1970, and made it her legal name inapproximately 1974.13b. [Is the following statement true]:11. Adams-Thompson’s statement that my wife did not appear untillater in the PX parking lot is false, since at no time was she separatedfrom me during our shopping trip.13b.(1) This statement is absolutely true. On that day we parked our car under theelevated approach to the Golden Gate Bridge, as we were alwaysaccustomed to parking there when going to the PX. There is less congestionthere, and more spaces closer to the PX entrance are usually available. Thiswas of all the more interest to us on 12 August 1987, as we were going to the- 382 -PX specifically to purchase a microwave oven as a present for Lilith’sdaughter. Microwave ovens are heavy, and I didn’t want to carry one anyfarther than necessary. At that time the microwave ovens in the PX weredisplayed in the front of the store a short distance back from the ID card-checking station. We went directly to the display and picked out an oven. APX clerk brought that model from the stock in the back, and we took it tothe check-out counter for purchasing. Then I carried the oven out to our carwhile Lilith walked immediately in front of me to clear the way and openthe car-trunk when we got there. There were three glass doors that she hadto open for me: one out of the PX itself, one into the PX “mall” area, andone out of the “mall” towards the bridge-approach parking lot. It wouldhave been extremely difficult for me to get through those three sets of doorswithout her opening them for me.Nor is there any reason why Lilith should have waited in the car while Iwent in alone to buy the oven. She is the cook in the family and knew whatshe was looking for in microwave features. And it was a present for herdaughter, so she wanted to pick it out personally. And, since we had parkedclose by under the bridge approach, there is no way that she could havemoved the car any closer to the mall doors for me.(2) Evidently Chaplain Adams-Thompson gave two different versions of thisstory, one to the FBI (contained in the FBI Form 302, 13 August 1987) andone to the SFPD (SFPD Incident Report) on the same day.(a) In his FBI version he said that I “made eye contact with Kinsey” in thePX. [I did not, and would not have recognized her if I had.] In his SFPDversion he said only that the child saw me.(b) In his FBI version he said that he and Kinsey saw my wife and myselftogether in the PX. In the SFPD version he said that he and Kinsey sawonly me in the PX, and that my wife did not appear until later in theparking lot.(c) In his FBI version he said that he “went to the car to wait for us, andsaw them, and took the license number”. In his SFPD version he saidthat he and Michele drove around to our car, where Kinsey supposedlyidentified my wife as “Shamby”. And -• As Adams-Thompson already knew who I was, it wouldn’t have beennecessary for him to take my car license number. There is nomention of the car or the license number in the SFPD report.- 383 -• The PX has two parking lots, one in front and one on the other sideof the mall, under the bridge approach. How would Adams-Thompson have known in which lot to “wait for us”? If he andMichele drove around to the bridge-approach lot from the main lotafter seeing us go through the mall, they wouldn’t have had time toget there [for the supposed Kinsey “identification” of Lilith] beforewe drove away. It is a long drive around from the main PX lot to thebridge-approach parking area.• If Adams-Thompson went to the vicinity of our car to wait for us,how would he have known which one it was? [It was not the car Ihad driven while assigned to the Presidio, but a rental car.](3) Adams-Thompson’s account of the PX encounter is thus full of lies andinconsistencies. He even told two different versions of the story to the FBIand SFPD on the same day. Again this supports my contention that the“identification” details of the PX encounter were deliberately andmaliciously invented by Adams-Thompson to support the attack which heand Michele had already decided [as is evident from the Hickey notes] tomake on my wife and myself. While it is evident that Adams-Thompsonhimself saw us at the PX, no other item in either the version he told to theFBI or the version he told to the SFPD can be verified - including thepresence of Kinsey Almond. The discrepancies between the two versionssuggest that he saw us at the PX, then invented the “reaction” and“statements” by his stepdaughter.14. Although LTC Aquino has previously responded to this question in generalterms, please again state whether LTC Aquino is aware of any parents orchildren related to the Presidio Child Development Center that have ever beenin 123 Acme. I certainly recognize that if a parent (of a child that was in theCDC) viewed the inside of 123 Acme under innocent circumstances (forexample at a party), then communicated specific information to their child,this information could potentially cause erroneous conclusions to be drawn byinvestigators.14.a. No parents or children related to the child-care center have ever been in 123Acme. My wife and I are private persons and did not socialize with otherPresidio families except at garrison social functions such as military balls and“Hail and Farewells” at the officers club, post commander’s home, etc. We neverheld any parties or receptions for Presidio personnel at our home at any timeduring my Presidio assignment from 1981 to 1986.- 384 -b. On 14 August 1987 San Francisco Police officer Glenn Pamfiloff, accompaniedby other SFPD officers, FBI agents, and two CID agents, executed a searchwarrant on 123 Acme from 9PM to lAM. A photographer accompanied thesearch and photographed every room and many individual articles in the entireresidence. Photos of myself and my wife were also taken, and several photoalbums of personal family and church photographs were confiscated. [All but afew photos have since been returned.] Almost certainly the photos taken by thephotographer, together with some of those confiscated, were subsequently usedin FBI/SFPD/CII) interrogation of Kinsey Almond [at which time Lawrence &Michele Adams-Thompson would also have seen them], the other Presidiochildren, parents, and/or “therapists” who were indoctrinating the children.c. In the San Francisco Chronicle, 2 August 1988, Edward Lempinen wrote:There were apparent inconsistencies in [Kinsey Almond’s] description, andnothing in the evidence or in interviews with at least 26 other young Presidiochildren “fully corroborated” the girl’s account, Deputy District AttorneyMichael Williams said.And although some children saw Aquino on TV and told their parents he wasa “bad man”, Williams said, none could pick him out of a police photo lineup.This story verifies that the police photographs and other family and churchphotographs taken from our home were shown to Kinsey Almond, at least 26other Presidio children, and presumably parents and “therapists” involvedfollowing 14 August 1987. I am quite certain you will find no accurate, detaileddescriptions of our home whatever from children, parents, or “therapists” thatpredate 14 August 1987. [This news story also verifies that some of the childrenhad been taught to call me a “bad man” during the months following the attackby Adams-Thompson. If this specific term was indeed used by more than onechild, it is obvious that it was suggested to them by an interrogator or“therapist” - or simply picked up from one of the several television newsreportsthat quoted this specific term from the Adams-Thompson allegations quoted inthe original San Francisco Police incident report.]d. On 10 April 1988 KTVU Channel #2 television broadcast a highly pre-publicizednews special in prime-time entitled Nightmare at the Presidio. As it was adetailed documentary of the entire Presidio scandal, I am certain that it wasviewed by virtually everyone in the Presidio community and probably most ofthe bay area as well. Included in that documentary were extensive camerainterviews with my wife and myself at 123 Acme, and a TV camera tour of theflat. Any child, parent, or “therapist” description of the premises after 10Aprilwould be the result of this film, if not the result of the previous raidphotographs.- 385 -e. I myself have been described in, interviewed in, and photographed in thepublicmedia throughout my entire life, and more sensationally since I joined theChurch of Satan in 1969 and then founded the Temple of Set in 1975. Within theArmy, despite my efforts to avoid sensationalism, the controversial “officer/Devil-worshipper” was inevitably an item of curiosity and gossip. After thepresslearned of Adams-Thompson’s accusations, of course, media attention focusedon the Temple of Set, my wife, and myself has been aggressive and continuous.Several books have been published this past year, among them Arthur Lyons’Satan Wants You with a photograph of my wife and myself at 123 Acme. In1985 a documentary book by Nevill Drury, The Occult Experience, featured achapter on the Temple of Set, an interview with Lilith and myself, and aphotograph of ourselves at 123 Acme. A documentary film by the same title wasreleased to educational television in October 1985, and featured an extensiveinterview with Lilith and myself at 123 Acme. This film was subsequentlyreleased as a commercial videotape and may presumably be rented from SanFrancisco video shops.f. Beginning 29 October 1987, immediately after the Adams-Thompson storybroke in the media, San Francisco TV channels #2 and #5 broadcast severalevening news segments containing interviews with Lilith and myself, photos of123 Acme, identification of its address, and discussions of the raid (includingour black-walled bedroom) and the details of the Adams-Thompson allegations(including the “Mikey and Shamby” names).g. On 24 November 1987 San Francisco Channel #2 broadcast an extensive newssegment reading the Adams-Thompson allegations in detail from the SFPDreport, again showing the exterior of 123 Acme, discussing our black-walledbedroom, and including interviews with Lilith and myself.h. Since the Adams-Thompson attack Lilith and I have also been interviewed onthe Oprah Winfrey Show (first broadcast 17 February 1988 and later re-broadcast), the highly-publicized Geraldo Rivera “Satanism” special on 25October 1988, and many local television news and talk-show episodes.i. In addition to the above television exposure of ourselves, our home, and theAdams-Thompson allegations in detail, there has been continuing and extensivecoverage (including photographs of Lilith and myself) in the printed media, toinclude all bay area newspapers and national printed media such as Newsweek.j. In summary it would have been easy for any interested person to describe theinterior of our home and our own appearance, and to show broadcast TV-videotapes and photographs of this to children, following the initial SFPD raid- 386 -on our home on 14 August 1987. Prior to that date it would have been possibleto describe the general appearance of our home and ourselves by viewing the1985 educational TV Occult Experience commercial videotape, or reading theaccompanying book, or by talking with any one of our personal friends who hadvisited our rather exotic home.15. Does LTC or Mrs. Aquino have any connection with Gary Hambright, or anyother 1986-1987 employee of the Presidio CDC?15. Neither my wife nor I have ever met Gary Hambright or any other employee ofthe Presidio day-care center, nor contacted them in any other way. We havenever paid any money to anyone with any connection to the day-care center forany reason whatever. We have never set foot in the day-care center. We havenever called it on the telephone, while I was assigned to the Presidio or beforeor subsequent to that assignment. We were not involved in any communityprograms at the Presidio which would have brought either of us into any contactwith children.16. Did anyone use [the Aquino flat at] 123 Acme for conducting any kind ofritualbetween the hours of 0800 and 1700 in 1986 or 1987, while LTC Aquino wasabsent?16.a. No. Nor does the interior of that flat contain a ceremonial chamber.b. Religious ceremonies of the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan arecustomarily held in the evening. In my 20 years as a Satanist I do not everrecallhaving attended or even heard of any ceremony that was conducted during 8-5“business hours”.c. When and where the Temple of Set may conduct rituals is ultimately irrelevantand immaterial. As has been previously, repeatedly, and exhaustivelyestablished, none of its rituals involve the abuse of children in any way,sexualor otherwise. I refuse to allow religious ceremonies conducted by the Temple ofSet as part of its worship activities to be interpreted in any way assymptomaticof criminal activity. They have always been completely legitimate, and a rightofour church under the Constitution, and we fully intend to continue them freefrom intimidation.II. Concerning paragraph 4, page 1 of Captain Mark W. Harvey’s 14 December 1988letter to Mr. Shawn Hanson [containing the above questions]:- 387 -Before any questions are answered, allow me to inform you that LTCAquino is suspected of a number of offenses relating to removal of childrenfrom the Presidio Child Development Center (CDC) in 1986 or early 1987without the lawful authorization of their parents (kidnapping); thensubsequently sexually assaulting these children with Mr. Gary Hambright and/or other unknown persons(s) (sodomy, rape, indecent assault on a child,conspiracy); then subsequently lying in sworn statements about these actions(false sworn statement); and preparing a false charge sheet against CPTAdams-Thompson (deliberate violation of a procedural rule); all in violation ofvarious articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).1. I have never removed or arranged to be removed from the Presidio day-carecenter any child for any purpose whatever, with or without parental knowledgeor consent.2. I have never sexually assaulted any child at any time anywhere. I have neverassaulted, sodomized, or raped anyone of any age or sex nor participated in anyagreement, arrangement, or conspiracy for anyone else to commit any of thesecrimes.3. I have never met nor had any contact with Mr. Gary Hambright whatever.4. I stand by all statements made in my sworn statements of 4 January 1988 and23 August 1988 and reaffirm them to be the truth in every detail to the best ofmy knowledge.5. Because of evidence which I obtained pursuant to my 23 June 1988 Freedom ofInformation Act request to the Staff Judge Advocate of the 25th InfantryDivision, I concluded that, despite the facts described in paragraphs #15-17 inmy 4 January 1988 statement, Adams-Thompson’s responsibility for theobscene card mailed to me could not be established beyond reasonable doubt.Accordingly, in my letter to Major General Charles P. Otstott, CommandingGeneral of the 25th Division on 23 August 1988, accompanying my 23 Augustsworn statement, I requested that Specification #2 of the charges againstAdams-Thompson be dropped.6. I am aware of no information or facts which cause me to alter my opinion thatSpecification #1 of the charges was properly and deservedly made, for thereasons given in my two sworn statements, particularly the updated 23 August1988 one. I believe that statement to represent the truth, not just concerningAdams-Thompson’s deliberately malicious and knowingly false attack upon mywife and myself, but concerning the nature of the entire Presidio childcarescandal. The contents of the Hickey notes, as related to me by Captain Hayes on- 388 -23 and 24 January 1989, further substantiate Lawrence and Michelle Adams-Thompson’s deliberate and knowing fabrication of their “package story” to theFBI and SFPD. Thus I feel that it is not only probable but indeed conclusivelydemonstrated that Lawrence Adams-Thompson is guilty of Specification #1 of aviolation of UCMJ Article #133 as I have charged.7. While I have had no access to any records of the general Presidioinvestigationthat have not been reported in the media, I have examined all media coverage ofthe scandal exhaustively since my wife and I were suddenly dragged into it. Ihave made extensive studies of the “child-abuse industry” epidemic ofmanufactured “day-care molestation” scandals across the nation. I am aware ofand have several files on various religious hate-groups who are actively andaggressively trying to portray legitimate Satanists as child murderers ormolesters in order to terrorize them and their families & children, and topersecute their religion out of existence. I consider the entire Presidioscandalto be just one more manufactured witch-hunt in this deplorable nationalepidemic, motivated by religious bigotry, financial greed, and petty ambitionsfor media attention by tile instigators,(and capitalizing upon the ignorance,confusion, and hysteria of parents who are unaware of this disgusting“industry”.8. The notes of Debbie Hickey, as related to me, are an appalling and atrociousabuse of the concept of “child therapy” - simply the same perverted, sex-obsessed indoctrination of day-care infants which has characterized all theother witch-hunts in this disgraceful national epidemic. If you will review thechart of “Similar Tales” contained in the Memphis Commercial Appeal series onthe national “child-abuse industry” epidemic (Attachment #A to my swornstatement of 23 August 1988), you will see that virtually every “discovery” madeby Hickey is merely a standard “therapist” indoctrination-theme for thesewitch-hunts - including all the features of her “play therapy” sessions withKinsey Almond. This is not reputable psychiatry; it is unprofessional anddeliberate fraud. I recommend that the CID submit all of Hickey’s notes andrecords from the Presidio scare to Dr. Lee Coleman of the Center for the Studyof Psychiatric Testimony, Berkeley, California for a professional evaluation oftheir ethical and professional substance. That nothing more than Hickey’s “playtherapy” notes should be the “evidence” for the Presidio investigations is aflagrant malpractice of medicine, as with the similarly-twisted “therapy” whichhas fueled all of the other witch-hunts. Certainly there has been sufficientexposure of this malpractice for the Army to recognize it and refuse to tolerateits further infliction and exploitation. A person like Hickey should not bepracticing psychiatry in the Army - nor for that matter in civilian society. Totheextent that Hickey was aware of the “package story” which Adams-Thompsontold the FBI and SFPD, and which he falsely attributed as a single, coherent- 389 -story to her “play therapy” sessions with Almond, Hickey - by failing to comeforward with the truth - has acted to obstruct justice and conspire against twoinnocent people.9. I don’t think that the U.S. Army should pay one cent on the $66 milliondamageclaims advanced by parents for crimes that never occurred.10. Mrs. Aquino and I believe that the United States Army should not allowChaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson to escape responsibility for the extensiveand excruciating damage he has willfully and maliciously caused to an innocentofficer and his wife. We consider him unfit to be an Army officer or a member ofthe Corps of Chaplains. I formally request that the CID, on the basis of thefactsnow known to its investigators and discussed herein, recommend that ChaplainAdams-Thompson be court-martialed on Specification #1 of the court-martialcharges I preferred against him on 4 January 1988, and additionally on a chargeof a deliberate attempt to defraud the government of $1.5 million with a falseclaim for damages.AffidavitI, Lieutenant Colonel Michael A. Aquino, have read or have had read to me thisstatement which begins on page 1 and ends on page 18. I fully understand thecontentsof the entire statement made by me. The statement is true.

Aquino1. I write in my capacity as defense counsel to inquire concerning the status oftheCIDC investigation of my client, LTC Michael Aquino. During my last conversationwith the case agent I was told that the investigation may continue for anothersixmonths. I must express a sense of frustration with the pace at which theinvestigation iscontinuing and what appears to be a refusal to recognize some obvious facts thatestablish LTC Aquino’s innocence.2. The San Francisco Police Department search of my client’s home took place intheFall of 1987. Since that time, both the SFPD and the FBI have delved into LTCand Mrs.Aquino’s background and have decided to close their investigations. I understandthatCIDC representatives accompanied the SFPD on the search and assisted them tosomeextent in conducting their investigation. Then, after a period of 18 months haselapsed,the CIDC has opened an independent file and told the news media that LTC Aquinohasbeen “titled.” The public affairs officer went on to further define that term asbeingclose to an “indictment.” All these actions took place after LTC Aquino appearedon the“Geraldo” special concerning “satanic crime.”3. All of LTC Aquino’s requests for access to the information upon which theseallegations are based have been denied. He has been torn apart in the press, hasborne- 391 -tremendous expense for legal defense in attempting to regain possession of hispersonal belongings, has suffered damage to his career, and has received phonethreatsarising from these investigations. He has cooperated with all reasonablerequests forinformation in an attempt to speed up the investigation process so that his namecan becleared.4. Given the damage that both LTC Aquino and the families of the children thatwereapparently injured by Gary Hambright have suffered and continue to suffer, thespeedwith which the investigation is proceeding is too slow. To suggest that thismatter willcontinue for another six months in the investigation stage is too much for allto bear. Ican assure you that the Aquinos realize the need for thoroughness in gatheringinformation, and they are willing to assist in every reasonable way. However Ihavebegun to question the efforts of the CIDC to gain the cooperation of theagencies thathave already examined this case to their satisfaction, namely the SFPD and theFBI. Iwould like to know if the CIDC has reviewed those case files and, if so, why isthisinvestigation taking so long?5. My second area of concern is the apparent refusal of the CIDC to evaluate keyrecords and address their impact on the case. My review of some of the recordsmadeduring the counseling sessions between LTC Hickey and the Adams-Thompson childcauses me to question the basis for the entire investigation. After the childrecountedmany bizarre stories during the period of February through June of 1987 ofpeople withgreen hair and pots containing arms and legs, it was her mother that suggestedthatthere may be some connection with “satanic worship”. It was also her mother thatfirstmade mention of the child having told of a man in uniform with a name tagcontainingthe letter “A”. Where is the medical evidence of trauma? Surely a child who hadexperienced the sodomous horrors described would suffer some injury. Unless ofcourse these stories were planted in the child’s psyche through parentalsuggestion.6. This information from the counseling notes differs from the SFPD report filedbyInvestigator Pamfiloff wherein he recounted the child’s father stating that thechild hadgiven this information directly to LTC Hickey during March or April. These mayappearto be minor differences, yet they must be investigated by the CIDC because theyprovide evidence of a possible “set-up” orchestrated by the Adams-Thompsons.Thiswould not be an extraordinary event given that the common, uninformed perceptionofLTC Aquino’s religion is that he is a “devil worshiper” and CPT Adams-Thompson’sduties as a Christian chaplain would set him against such activity.7. I have enclosed a copy of a tape recording made by LTC Aquino last weekduringan interview with a news reporter from station WSVN in Miami, Florida. In thetape ofthe television interview, LTC Aquino explained some of the precepts of hisreligion thatprovide a more informed view of his beliefs than are commonly perceived. Youshouldfind the tape helpful in dispelling some of the myths of him as a “devilworshiper”. He- 392 -utterly rejects any and all acts of violence or abuse towards any person. Hisattempts toclarify his religious beliefs and defend his name on television throughout thisinvestigation attest to his bravery and innocence. We must all ask ourselves ifwe wouldhave the courage to stand up for our right to the free exercise of our religionin the faceof such adversity. As LTC Aquino so aptly points out, we tend to criticize theJews inNazi Germany for failing to speak out when they too were accused ofparticipating in“blood sacrifice” and the torture of children. While there may be criminals inoursociety who abuse children and others, calling it part of their religiouspractices, LTCand Mrs. Aquino are not among them. I would hope that the CIDC has tried todetermine whether Mr. Gary Hambright was.8. LTC Aquino preferred charges against Chaplain Adams-Thompson for m a k i n gfalse statements against him. These charges were said to have been investigatedby theSan Francisco CIDC Field Office. When LTC Aquino asked to see that portion ofthe filepertaining to the charges he had preferred, his FOIA request was denied. Iappeal thatdecision to you as the CIDC Commander and again request that LTC Aquino beprovided that portion of the file so that he can be assured that his allegationsweretaken and investigated seriously.9. As my client has stated repeatedly, he is willing and ready to assist theCIDC inany reasonable way. He merely requests that he be given some specific dates orreasonable time frame during which he is supposed to have abused the Adams-Thompson or any other child. He will examine his records to account for hislocationon that date. It is hard to believe that the families making these allegationscould notprovide some detail as to when their children were in the care of the Child CareCenter,or that the facility would not have maintained some attendance records.10. I request that my client be provided with some accounting of the delay inmovingthis investigation forward. Second, I request that you grant his appeal to theCIDC’srejection of his FOIA request for that portion of the file relating to hischarges againstCPT Adams-Thompson. Finally, the case agents must take notice of some of theobvious facts establishing LTC Aquino’s innocence and provide him the chance torebutspecific allegations rather than the broad innuendo that has surfaced to date.Thankyou for considering my client’s position. We trust that the CIDC will keep theinterestsof justice to all at the forefront of this matter./s/ Thomas M. Hayes IIICaptain, Judge AdvocateSenior Defense Counsel- 393 -Appendix 47:Letter, Michael Aquino toMajor General Eugene Cromartie 3/6/89March 6, 1989Major General Eugene L. CromartieCommanding GeneralU.S. Army Criminal Investigation CommandDear General Cromartie:I have received a copy of Captain Thomas Hayes’ 17 February 1989 letter to you,andwould like to add some comments of my own.I was first notified of this new CID investigation in late November 1988, whenSpecial Agent Stephen Penaluna telephoned me about it from the San FranciscoFieldOffice. I could not believe that anyone could still take ChaplainAdams-Thompson’s liesseriously -much less consider them “probable cause” for opening yet a thirdformalcriminal investigation based on them. I asked to speak with the personresponsible formaking the decision to open this investigation.Penaluna passed me to Special Agent Robert Birck, who stated to me that he andhealone was responsible for making the decision. He went on to say that the CIDhadalways intended to make this special investigation of the Adams-Thompsonallegationas part of its more general investigation of the entire Presidio scandal, andthat the CIDhad only now gotten around to it [over a year after the allegation was made!].In answerto my specific question, he denied absolutely that this new investigation of mewas theresult of my appearance on Geraldo Rivera’s October 25, 1988 “Satanism”televisionshow. I took Birck at his word that the CID simply needed to “clear its books”of thematter.I was subsequently informed by Captain Thomas Hayes, the U.S. Army TrialDefense Service attorney assigned to advise me, that the CID’s data-base on theAdams-Thompson allegations was in a state of utter disarray. On January 1, 1989,accordingly, I took the initiative to provide the CID with a complete set of allof therelevant information I possessed concerning the affair, to include the SanFranciscoPolice Department’s investigation based on the Adams-Thompson allegation.Major Mark W. Harvey, CID 6th Region Judge Advocate, further invited me tosuggest any leads which the CID could follow in order to verify my wife’s and myinnocence. Accordingly on January 5, 1989 I provided him with a 9-page list of34- 394 -leads, discussed in depth, any of whose resolution would all the more expose andvalidate the truth of the situation. 205I further offered to provide written answers to any pertinent questions whichtheCID might have for me. On December 14, 1988 the CID sent me a list of 16questions, towhich I responded on January 27, 1989 in considerable detail in the form of aswornstatement with accompanying supporting data. 206 Although I made it clear that Iwouldrespond to any additional pertinent questions which the CID might have, nonehavebeen forthcoming.The investigation concerning me remained open. Two weeks ago Captain Hayesinquired of Special Agent Birck the reason for the delay, and how much longertheinvestigation was expected to continue. Birck responded that, while the CIDrecognizedthe absurdity of the “therapy” notes which Adams-Thompson invoked as the sourceofhis allegation, “other leads” were now being followed, and that this could takeas longas six additional months beyond the three already spent by the CID - to saynothing ofthe year-long investigations preceding it.While the CID has not informed me of any specific allegation other than that byAdams-Thompson, I am in the position to know one thing conclusively: thatneither mywife nor I has ever had anything to do with any of the Presidio day-carechildren, norhas either of us ever molested any child. Therefore there cannot be any “leads”whichare anything beyond unsubstantiated accusations by the therapist who is tryingtocover up the damage her incompetence has caused to two innocent people, and/orbyparents who have coached children into “recognitions” following the massivenationalmedia exposure given me as a consequence of Adams-Thompson’s original attack, inorder to try to collect on $66 million of claims against the government for“molestation” of their children at the Presidio.When Captain Hayes advised me of Birck’s statement, I telephoned Birck myself toask him exactly what the problem was. He said that he could not discuss the casewithme over the telephone. I then offered to meet with him and his investigators inSanFrancisco, which he accepted.Subsequently I was advised by Major Harvey that plans for such an interview werebeing indefinitely postponed, and that an interview might not be necessary atall. I wasfurther advised that responsibility for the investigation was being removed fromtheSan Francisco Field Office to the 6th Region Headquarters, and that a newspecialagent was being brought in to supervise it.205 Appendix #44.206 Appendix #45.- 395 -While all of this CID administrative reorganization may indeed be taking place,I amnonetheless coming reluctantly to several conclusions about the entire affair. Ithink itis appropriate to bring them first to your attention as CID Commander.(1) As shown in my August 23, 1988 and January 27, 1989 sworn statements,Adams-Thompson’s allegation was not substantiated by any objective, factualevidencewhatever. Furthermore it has come to light that the source which he claimed forhisstory - a cohesive, rational account given by his stepdaughter to “therapist”DebbieHickey - never existed at all, but was rather invented by him and Mrs. Adams-Thompson. The original accusation - the justification for naming Mrs. Aquino andmyself “suspects” - has thus been exposed as a deliberate fabrication.Nevertheless theCID investigation of me continues.(2) As it was Adams-Thompson’s August 1987 attack which first associated my namewith the Presidio witch-hunt in the media, I am certain that there are no otherallegations or “identifications” which predate that time. Once Mrs. Aquino and Iwerepublicly showcased in the press, of course, any number of copy-cat allegationscould begenerated, based simply on the many descriptions, television films, andphotographs ofourselves and our San Francisco home which flooded the bay area and the nation.Icannot think that any such copycat allegations - all as unsupported as Adams-Thompson’s - would justify the CID continuing to suspend an innocent officer inthelimbo of an indefinite investigation status. What is to prevent any othercrackpot,religious bigot, or claim-greedy parent from inventing still more accusationswhenthese are discredited? Am I supposed to spend the rest of my military career asanautomatic “investigatee” any time some vindictive crank feels an urge to disruptmylife?(3) There is, quite simply, no factual or objective reason for continuing thisinvestigation of me one moment further. Even if the CID initiated it in goodfaith, thefacts clearing my name and that of my wife were quickly brought to light for anyobjective individual to see. No “great leap of faith” is required for this; thefacts areboth obvious and conspicuous. As a Military Intelligence professional myself, Iknowfull well when facts are conclusive and when they are not. The facts establishedas amatter of record in this case verify conclusively the innocence of my wife andmyself.(4) Not only should this investigation be terminated without further delay, itshouldbe accompanied by an official statement that clearly and unequivocallyexonerates mywife and myself from Adams-Thompson’s malicious allegation. The manufacturednature of those allegations has now been revealed through the details of the“therapist”notes. No termination of this investigation which allows any doubt concerning mywife’s and my integrity and innocence to persist - such as an “insufficientevidence”statement when in fact there is no evidence whatever - is acceptable.- 396 -(5) In January 1988, after four months of attempts to achieve an administrativeresolution of Adams-Thompson’s deliberate, malicious attack on my wife andmyself, Ipreferred court-martial charges against him. Special Agent Birck was given theresponsibility to investigate those charges. After a five-month “investigation”herecommended against referring them for court-martial despite the clear evidencefordoing so. My FOIA request to see Birck’s report concerning the charges wasdenied.Nevertheless, during the present investigation concerning me, considerableadditionalinformation confirming Adams-Thompson’s criminal actions has come to light - forexample, the Hickey notes and the discovery that Adams-Thompson told differentversions of his story to the FBI and to the San Francisco Police. As thisinformationcame from CID sources, it was certainly available to Birck when he wassupposedlyinvestigating the charges I preferred. Nevertheless he recommended againstAdams-Thompson’s court-martial on the grounds that “there was no evidence tosubstantiatethe charges”.(6) Today, therefore, I remain under the professional and social stigma of“criminalinvestigation” despite the clear evidence that I am innocent, whileAdams-Thompsonremains free and immune from investigation or charges despite the clear evidencethathe committed a deliberate, criminal act against another officer and his wife.Both ofthese situations are an abuse of the justice which the CID supposedly exists tosafeguard for all soldiers and their families.(7) It is easy to say that a CID investigation is not itself punitive but issimply a fact-finding procedure which shouldn’t trouble me even if it continues for a year ormore.Quite obviously this is not the case. My personnel file is, flagged and mysecurityclearance is suspended. Within the Army I am stigmatized by being in a “criminalinvestigation” status - all the more so because of the supposed rationale forthatinvestigation: the kidnapping, rape, and sodomizing of an infant child. Just thefactthat this new investigation has been initiated has been used by the press toimply that Iam “guilty after all” despite the termination of the previous investigations.Just six daysago, on a March 1, 1989 show dealing with child pornography, drugs, andprostitution,Geraldo Rivera showed film clips of me and introduced an ex-FBI agent who saidthat Iwas now under “grand jury investigation” for the Adams-Thompson allegation.(8) My wife and I have now been subjected to more than a year and a half ofdeaththreats, vandalism, and severe emotional stress because of this endless,senseless “stateof investigation”. My professional reputation in the Army, previously immaculateandexemplary throughout my nineteen years’ service, has been stigmatized horribly.Ourparents and our own children have been seriously traumatized. My businessinterestsin the San Francisco Bay Area have been affected, as one’s social reputation isall-important in commercial dealings. I have sustained over $50,000 in attorney’sfees andvandalism repairs. In short, Mrs. Aquino and I have suffered and are continuingtosuffer atrociously because of Adams-Thompson’s attack. You have the authorityand- 397 -the responsibility to end this persecution before it continues any further, andtorecommend punitive action against the person criminally responsible for it.(9) An additional factor in this is the effect upon my religion and itsformally-constituted institution, the Temple of Set. From the time of its founding in1975 to thepresent, its activities have been ethical in all regards and its communityreputation acompletely unblemished one. Adams-Thompson’s attack against two of its mostseniorofficials necessarily reflects upon the entire Temple - at a time when hysteriaabout“Satanic cults” is a nationwide fad among cranks and religious hate-groups. Thesafetyand security of all Setians, their families, and their children are jeopardizedthe moreyou allow the erroneous impression to persist that we in any way tolerate,prescribe, orpractice abuse of children. As our official literature verifies, we do not abusechildren,nor even admit minors to membership. We are a legitimate, law-abiding, andsincerereligion, and our members have the right to worship in their own fashion, freefromfear of harassment or persecution.(10) The same former FBI agent stated on the March 1 Geraldo show that the CIDinvestigation concerning me was opened specifically because of Congressionalpressurebrought to bear on the Army following the October 1988 Geraldo special. If thisis true,it flatly contradicts Birck’s statement that he opened it on his own initiativeas a routinestep in the general Presidio investigation. Furthermore, the CID is supposed toopeninvestigations based upon legitimate probable cause that a crime occurred, noton thebasis of political or religiously-motivated arm-twisting. Congress has its ownpower tohold hearings and make investigations as it deems necessary; it should not beusing theArmy’s criminal investigative machinery for this purpose, nor as a means ofpersecuting or intimidating a soldier and his family because of their religiousbeliefs.In summary, this investigation of me has now passed clearly beyond the pointwhereI can see any legitimate reason whatever for keeping it open. Any good-faithdoubtswhich the CID had to resolve have, by any rational standard, been alleviated. Itherefore request that you terminate the investigation without further delay,and thatyou do so with a clear and unqualified exoneration of my wife and myself.If you do not do this, I will have no choice but to conclude that theinvestigation isbeing kept open, and Adams-Thompson’s criminal act concealed and protected, fornoother reason than to persecute and intimidate my wife and myself because of ourreligion. I would then have no choice but to initiate formal complaints throughtheInspector General system, concerning administrative misuse of the CID’sinvestigativepowers, and through the Army Equal Opportunity system, concerning religiousdiscrimination and persecution.I sincerely hope that such measures will not be necessary. My wife and I havesuffered enough - and more than we ever should have at all. We want nothing more- 398 -than to be left alone, to put our lives back together after the abuse we haveendured forso long. I do not think that this is the least bit unreasonable.As for Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson: If as Commanding General of theCIDC you enforce its mandate to expose and recommend punishment for criminalactsby anyone regardless of branch or office, then you will title this individualfor thevicious and malicious act he deliberately committed against a fellow soldier andhiswife, and for the three false monetary claims based upon it, totaling over $2million,through which he has deliberately tried to defraud the government.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

As I stated in my February memo toMGCromartie, LTC Aquino will cooperate in any reasonable way that he can to seethis"},{"pageContent":"case wrapped up. He and Mrs. Aquino continue to suffer injury to theirreputation andcareer as a result of the rumor and innuendo upon which this case is based.2. As I pointed out at our meeting, several facts stand out in establishing thatChaplain Adams-Thompson and his wife have orchestrated the attack on theAquinos.The notes made by LTC Hickey during the interviews with Kinsey Almond directlyimpeach the San Francisco Police Department report made by InvestigatorPamfiloffbased upon Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s complaint. Kinsey had not mentioned a“Mikey” or “Shamby”, according to LTC Hickey’s notes, at the time that ChaplainAdams-Thompson had told the SFPD that Kinsey had made such comments. LTCHickey’s notes further mention that it was Mrs. Adams-Thompson who had initiatedthe theory of “satanic crime”.3. I think it only fair to request that Chaplain Adams-Thompson be flagged andinvestigated further. He must be confronted with these glaring inconsistencies.I mustexpress some frustration at never having been provided that portion of the CIDfilepertaining to the investigation of Chaplain Adams-Thompson. After all, how couldrevealing that part of the file jeopardize the investigation into the allegedchild abuse?- 400 -The FOIA denial causes one to pause and consider whether a real investigationintoLTC Aquino’s charges against the Chaplain was ever conducted.4.

Hayes III, Senior Defense Counsel, PresidioField Office, Presidio of San Francisco, CA 94129SUBJECT: Status of USACIDC Investigation of Lieutenant Colonel Michael A. Aquino1. This letter is in response to your request for information, dated 17 February1989,regarding the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command’s (USACIDC),investigation of Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Michael A. Aquino.2. On 25 October 1988, LTC Aquino appeared on the nationwide television GeraldoRivera special on Satanism. The USACIDC inquiry regarding the allegationsagainstLTC Aquino was initiated prior to October 1988. The investigation was notinitiated inresponse to pressure by Congress or the media. USACIDC has not been improperlyinfluenced by anyone either to start or continue the investigation.3. The USACIDC investigation of LTC Aquino is not based upon his religiousbeliefs.The sole basis for the investigation of LTC Aquino is whether or not LTC Aquinoviolated the Uniform Code 0f Military Justice. As you are well aware, USACIDC isalsointerested in establishing whether or not anyone else violated the Uniform CodeofMilitary Justice regarding the allegations of child sexual abuse.4. I have previously informed you that USACIDC has reviewed the case files oftheFederal Bureau of Investigation and the San Francisco Police Department. USACIDCwill avoid redoing the work of other investigative agencies whenever possible.USACIDC has limited resources and cannot afford to waste time replowing the sameground that has been plowed by other agencies.5. As you are aware, USACIDC recently transferred control of the LTC Aquinoinvestigation to Sixth Region from the San Francisco Field Office and brought ina newinvestigator, who is now in charge of this investigation. These changes weremade toexpedite completion of the investigation. USACIDC is making significant progresstoward the timely and thorough completion of the investigation.- 402 -6. On 13 December 1989 LTC Aquino was flagged. LTC Aquino has been underUSACIDC formal investigation for about four months. This investigation is verycomplex, with many important witnesses scattered throughout the United States.LTCAquino is not under any restriction by the Army. I regret that I am not able topredictwhen the USACIDC investigation will be completed; however I can say that it willrequire between 60 and 90 days to be finalized.7. LTC Aquino has provided leads in his most recent sworn statement, and I havebeen assured that many of these leads have all ready been pursued.8. LTC Aquino has declined to consent to release of his banking records. Thisdecision by LTC Aquino may delay completion of the investigation because it isnecessary to establish LTC Aquino’s location in 1986 and 1987 using lessreliable andefficient means than the Aquino’s banking and credit card records.9. LTC Aquino has decided that he is willing to be interviewed by USACIDC assoonas USACIDC is ready to conduct the interview. This decision reflects well on LTCAquino, and should tend to expedite completion of the investigation.10. I have provided your letter of 17 February 1989 to Headquarters, USACIDC.11. On 6 April 1989 you told me that I did not have to go through you tocommunicate with LTC Aquino, and that I could discuss the merits of his casewithhim. After I have talked to LTC Aquino, I will inform you of the contents of anyconversation that I have had with your client.12. On 7 April 1989 LTC Aquino telephonically informed me that he had written aletter to LTC Hickey’s superiors at Fort Lewis with a copy furnished to me, aswell asthe Office of the Surgeon General, requesting disciplinary action against LTCHickeyfor lack of medical ethics and malpractice.13. I informed LTC Aquino that I had seen the tape of the television program inMiami, and read his letter requesting retraction of misleading portions of theMiamiprogram. I told LTC Aquino that I was certain that the lady on the televisionprogramthat was in shadow was not LTC Hickey, and I did not know the identity of thelady.14. I told LTC Aquino that I would complete this letter today and provide it toyou.Nothing else of significance was discussed in our telephone conversation of 7April1989./s/ Mark W. HarveyMajor, Judge AdvocateRegion Judge Advocate- 403 -Appendix 50: Letter, Michael Aquino toMajor Mark Harvey 4/24/89April 24, 1989Dear Major Harvey:Captain Thomas Hayes has just provided me with a copy of your 7 April letter tohim, and I have some comments concerning it for consideration by Special AgentCatesand yourself:(1) Per the enclosed letter to Geraldo Rivera, I am attempting to verify thestatementon his show that Congressional or other pressure was brought upon the Army toopenthis third investigation of me. I will keep you advised of anything I learn inthisregard.207(2) Your statement that “the USACIDC inquiry regarding the allegations againstLTCAquino was initiated prior to October 1988” reflects only the pro formatechnicalitythat the general investigation concerning the Presidio day-care centerwitch-hunt hasremained open since 1986.The CID investigation of me obviously began the month following the Geraldo“Satanism” show [as indeed you acknowledge in paragraph #6 of your letter]. Iwasfirst notified of this investigation by Special Agent Penaluna by telephone inlateNovember 1988, at which time he required me to be photographed and fingerprintedby the CID office in Granite City, Illinois. He stated that the basis for hisrequirementwas that the CID was opening a formal investigation of me. His account isverified bythe fact that my records were not flagged until 13 December 1988. Furthermore,asrecounted in my 6 March 1989 letter to General Cromartie, Special Agent Birckstatedto me that he had personally made the decision to open this new investigation ofme inNovember.The allegations by Adams-Thompson were extremely serious: the kidnapping, rape,and sodomy of a 2-year-old infant. I do not think it likely that the CID, if itconsideredsuch allegations at all credible, would put them on a “back burner” for wellover a year,with no attempt whatever to even ask me about them.Two CID agents were present during the 14 August 1987 raid on our San Franciscohome by the San Francisco Police Department, so I know that the CID knewsufficientlyabout the Adams-Thompson allegations to decide at that time whether it felt liketaking207 Rivera did not respond to my inquiry.- 404 -them seriously. If it did, my records should have been flagged right then inAugust1987.Obviously the decision to open this investigation of me was made consequent totheGeraldo special. The statements by Penaluna and Birck, and the formal paperworkinitiated by the CID, clearly establish this. The only question remaining is onwhoseorders, and because of what political influence brought to bear. As the answerto thisquestion may establish whether the initiation of the investigation was improperand inviolation of the 1st and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, and whetherattemptshave also been made to politically pre-influence its outcome in any way, I willcontinueto pursue it actively as long as I understand my wife, myself, and my religionto beobjects of official intimidation and persecution.(3) Of course the CID investigation of me is based on my religious beliefs. Nonon-Satanist Lieutenant Colonel would have been flagged and made the subject of acriminal investigation simply because of allegations by a chaplain which havelongsince been exposed as unsubstantiated and deliberately fabricated.The CID knows and has medically confirmed that Kinsey Almond was never rapedor sodomized as Adams-Thompson alleged to the FBI and SFPD. Therefore it isalreadyproven that the supposed crime never occurred at all. Incidentally, if the CIDhasknown this since Adams-Thompson made his initial allegations to the SFPD andFBI,why did the CID not communicate this critical information to an Army officerundersevere police, media, and public attack for such a rape/sodomy?The CID knows that no features of our San Francisco home match the “description”which Adams-Thompson represented as coming from his stepdaughter, but which wasobviously his own fabrication. [As for the “black-walled living room”, which thepresstried to sensationalize as “verified”, our living room is an entirely differentpastel color.Our black/silver/red bedroom is not a living room. Moreover any mention of a“blackroom” is absent from the Hickey notes, and was obviously appended to the“packagestory” by Adams-Thompson on the hunch that, like Anton LaVey’s famous black-roomed house in San Francisco, our home would also have one or more similarly-painted rooms.]Obviously the sole basis for the “package story” manufactured by the chaplain ishate-propaganda concerning Satanism and its supposed interest inchild-molestation,and his obvious motive, as a professional of a religion with a centuries-olddoctrinalhatred of ours, of trying to harm my wife and myself and discredit the church towhichwe belong. Abundant examples of such hate-propaganda - from Sandi Gallant’svideotaped lecture, to the revolting “Satanic child abuse” checklists of Gouldand other“witch-hunting” therapists, to the vast media sensationalizing of suchallegations fromMichelle Remembers and the McMartin case forward - have been provided to you.- 405 -Among the written questions which the CID posed to me, and to which I respondedinmy 27 January 1989 sworn statement, were questions concerning religious ritualsandAdams-Thompson’s religion-based motives.(4) I appreciate your statement that “USACIDC is also interested in establishingwhether or not anyone else violated the UCMJ regarding the allegations of childsexualabuse”. In this regard, however, I am concerned about the following:I have been officially informed that it is CID policy, made at the Washington,D.C.level, that no other flagging actions will even be considered while thisinvestigation is inprogress. As the act of requesting a flag signals the CID’s official opinionthat “credibleallegations” exist, this a priori policy that no other flags will be consideredplaces thestatements and actions of Adams-Thompson in a protected status. Further, theinsistence of the exclusive flag on my file carries with it the implication thatAdams-Thompson’s allegations, despite their abundant inaccuracies and inconsistencies,arenevertheless enshrined as “credible”.The effect of this policy, as it appears to me to date, is to preserve me in a“criminalinvestigation” status long after the false nature of the allegations should havebecomeevident to any objective investigator, and to simply ignore all the evidence -as carefullyand exhaustively provided to you in my sworn statements of 4 January 1988, 23August1988, and 27 January 1989 - which proves that Adams-Thompson deliberately andmaliciously fabricated his “package story” and his allegations to the SFPD andFBIbased upon it.Any effort now by Adams-Thompson to say that he is or was “just repeating to theauthorities what his stepdaughter told him” - a common dodge in child-abusewitch-hunts - is easily exposed as a lie to try to hide his criminal actions in August1987. It hasnow been established exactly what Kinsey Almond originally said and did not saytoDebbie Hickey, and none of Hickey’s notes include anything resembling the“packagestory” which, embellished with technical details and sexual vulgarities beyond a2-year-old’s comprehension and carefully doctored to eliminate inconvenient therapystatements, Adams-Thompson told the FBI and SFPD had “come from hisstepdaughter”. If the Hickey notes are placed side-by-side with the the 13August 1987SFPD incident report and the FBI Form 302, it is clear that the Hickey notes donotsubstantiate anything Adams-Thompson told the FBI and SFPD that theydid. Further, Adams-Thompson certainly knew that his stepdaughter was a virginwithout any signs of injury at the time he gave the SFPD and FBI the story thatshehad been raped and sodomized by two adult males.To date the CID has not even responded to Captain Thomas Hayes’ 21 March 1989letter to Special Agent Cates, through your office, requesting thatAdams-Thompson beflagged on the basis of the clear evidence that he fabricated the “packagestory” and- 406 -gave a deliberately and knowingly fraudulent account of Kinsey Almond’sstatements,actions, and therapy sessions to the SFPD and FBI.To date the CID continues to refuse Captain Hayes and myself access to the CIDinvestigation of Adams-Thompson which Special Agent Birck supposedly conductedinresponse to the UCMJ charges which I preferred against Adams-Thompson. NeitherCaptain Hayes nor I have been advised of any legitimate reason why thisinvestigationreport should be denied to us. Obviously the quality, sincerity, andthoroughness withwhich this investigation was conducted bears directly upon the question of biasagainstme, and bias in favor of Adams-Thompson, in the present investigation. I oncemorereiterate my FOIA request, first made almost a year ago on 23 June 1988, for afull andcomplete copy of that CID investigative report in response to the UCMJ charges.(5) I noted your comment that the CID has “reviewed the case files of the SanFrancisco Police Department”. I would appreciate your confirming to CaptainHayes ormyself that, in doing so, you have consulted directly and in specifics with Ms.IreneRapoza, Senior Analyst, Office of Citizen Complaints, San Francisco PoliceCommission, concerning these case files and the conduct of the officers directlyinvolved (Glenn Pamfiloff and Sandi Gallant) with them. As the CID is aware, Ihavefiled an extensive and detailed series of administrative and legal complaintsand courtactions concerning the actions of Pamfiloff and Gallant, most currently the OCCcomplaints being investigated by Ms. Rapoza. Any CID review of SFPD “case files”inignorance or disregard of Ms. Rapoza’s analysis of those files will necessarilybe biasedand distorted.I have requested Ms. Rapoza to make her findings available to the CID as much aspossible. I am certain, in support of her own investigation, she would alsowelcome anyinformation which the CID has which bears upon the conduct of Pamfiloff andGallant.(6) Concerning CID “review of the files of the FBI”: On 8 February 1988 I made aFOIA request to the FBI for copies of all documents pertaining to myself and theTemple of Set, to include any and all paperwork generated by the San FranciscoFieldOffice of the FBI. While receipt of my FOIA request was acknowledged, and whileIreceived a 28 March 1988 form letter stating that “pertinent documents had beenlocated”, I have yet to receive a single such document. In answer to my severalwrittenand telephonic requests, I was told only that the FBI is backlogged and willeventuallyget around to my request “in six months to a year from the request date”. It hasnowbeen well over a year since I made the request. Obviously the contents of theFBI filesin question are potentially important to me, and presumably to you, in thispresentinvestigation. I request your assistance in expediting my FOIA request. It isrequest#FOIPA-29439 1, and the POC in the FBI Records Management Division is Mr. WillisNewton, telephone (202) 324-5767.- 407 -(7) I further noted your statement that “CIDC has limited resources and cannotafford to waste time replowing the same ground that has been plowed by otheragencies”. What exactly is Special Agent Cates’ time-consuming, nationwideseries ofinterviews with Presidio parents and children if not just such “replowing”?All of the Presidio parents and children were interviewed by the FBI, and againbyPamfiloff in his quest to find some corroboration of the Adams-Thompsonallegations.As reported in the 2 August 1988 San Francisco Chronicle, all these interviewsproduced no identifications and no corroboration.Even that series of interviews, conducted by an SFPD officer with an obviousinterest in justifying his aggressive actions against Mrs. Aquino and myself,wasconducted months after all of San Francisco, including the Presidio parents andchildren, had been inundated by the flood of publicity given Mrs. Aquino andmyself,our home, the Temple of Set, and the Adams-Thompson allegations. So why shouldSpecial Agent Cates be replowing this same ground yet again a year later? Theonlystatements made by any children or by their parents with any credibility wouldbethose before the media publicity avalanche.Even prior to that avalanche, since the Hickey therapy notes establish that Mrs.Adams-Thompson had begun to introduce allegations about “a Satanic cult” and “anArmy officer” into Kinsey Almond’s therapy sessions as far back as 2 June 1987,theAdams-Thompsons had ample opportunity to spread such suggestions among otherparents militantly active in the ongoing Presidio witch-hunt, either directly orthroughAlmond’s contact with other Presidio children after her mother and stepfatherhadbegun to indoctrinate her with this idea.(8) I take exception to your statement that “many important witnesses arescatteredthroughout the United States”.Since no crime ever occurred, there are no “witnesses” to anything. The originalAdams-Thompson allegation, as detailed in the SFPD incident report, mentioned no“witnesses” at the fictional rape/sodomy/lion-foot-bathtub session, nor at theallegedPX “identification” incident. No “witnesses” were produced by Pamfiloff in hisinterviews in search of one. No Presidio parents other than the Adams-Thompsonshave filed any claims on the basis of any alleged contact between my wife andmyselfand their children. The whole notion of “witnesses” suddenly being produced now,asstill one more amendment to Adams -Thompson’s continuously-changing “packagestory”, is preposterous.May I again observe that $66 million is no small temptation for someone to lieaboutalmost anything, to say nothing of coaching a young child into similarly lying.This is allthe more tempting since, as is the case in all previous “molestation”witch-hunts,- 408 -parents and therapists have endeavored to hide behind statements supposedly“originating” from the child, thereby avoiding personal risk of being caught inthe liesthemselves and thus being subject to prosecution for perjury.(9) The fact that I am not under any restriction by the Army is of course notnearlythe whole story of our continuing ordeal.Mrs. Aquino and I have been objects of intense and continuous vilification byhostilejournalists since they first became aware of the Adams-Thompson allegations inOctober 1987. Under separate cover I am sending you copies of all the SanFrancisconewspaper stories written concerning the allegations from October 1987 to thepresent;you will find it a very thick stack indeed - with endless showcasing of theallegationsand little if any attention to the inaccuracies and inconsistencies therein.Only luridstories sell newspapers.San Francisco has been the home of my family for many generations, ever since mygrandfather was personal physician to the Crocker family. It is the city where Iwasborn and lived most of my life, the city in which I earned my Eagle Scout badge,the cityin which Mrs. Aquino earned her Honors Degree in college, and the city in whichIearned an Adjunct Professorship at Golden Gate University after many years ofteaching there.Our family home, acquired by my grandfather, has now been the object of so muchvandalism, telephonic threats, and hostile public attention that my wife isafraid to livethere anymore. Its interior has been pawed through by a team of raiders whoarrivedlate at night and tore the place apart until the early morning hours,photographing andconfiscating our most personal and private church and family papers and articles- evenincluding Mrs. Aquino’s underwear.In addition to over $50,000 of legal and vandalism-repair costs, we have now had1-1/2 years of our lives completely convulsed by this vicious persecution. Weare unableto live any kind of normal life. It is only with considerable effort that I amable tofunction in my present military assignment, and at both home and work I amconstantly contacted by journalists wanting statements or interviews concerningtheallegations and the past and present investigations.As I pointed out to General Cromartie, existing under formal, publicinvestigationfor child rape and sodomy is not the same thing as existing under investigationforfudging on income taxes or stealing a typewriter. The social stigma associatedwith thecrimes alleged by Adams-Thompson is easily the most extreme in society. Evenwhenwe are eventually exonerated, it will take years for this “image” to becorrected - andthe harm caused us by it will never be wholly undone.- 409 -So please do not represent our experience as being a mild one in comparison withordinary CID investigations - wherein, I might add, there is generally evidencethat thecrime in fact occurred in the first place, regardless of whether theinvestigatee is theculprit. I am now under investigation for the rape and sodomy of a child who hasbeenmedically established to be a virgin - and further “investigation” of thisphysiologicalmiracle is supposed to take another two to three months beyond the 1-3/4 yearssincethe CU) participation in the raid on our home?(10) I provided leads not only in my most recent sworn statement, but also in my5January 1989 letter to you, which contained 22 leads pertinent to the Adams-Thompson allegations specifically and 12 leads pertinent to the Presidiowitch-huntgenerally. To date all the information which Captain Hayes has learned stemmingfromthese leads has served to verify my innocence and document the deliberatelymanufactured and malicious nature of Adams-Thompson’s allegations. This beingthecase, why am I still flagged - and why is Adams-Thompson not flagged?(11) As I have indicated to the CID several times - in my sworn statement,throughCaptain Hayes, and directly to you - I have no qualms whatever about producingmybanking records for any specific date on which a particular crime in aparticularlocation has been alleged with some reason to believe it beyond unsubstantiatedinvention.I do not see why, just because an Army chaplain who has already been caught inseveral lies and inconsistencies decides to revise his story to fit a time whenI was stillassigned to the Presidio before PCS assignment to Washington D.C., this shouldin andof itself be “reason” for the CID to request my records.It is “necessary to establish LTC Aquino’s location in 1986 and 1987” only ifthere iscredible reason to think that I have committed some specific crime at somespecifictime and place. Then, as I have said all along, I will be pleased to provide anyand allverifications of my location and actions which I can produce from my records,bankingand otherwise. As an individual with a lifelong reputation of the highestintegrity, Ireject utterly the notion that my mere presence in my native city, where I havemaintained my legal residence for 42 years, should somehow imply that I aminvolvedin some crime which is alleged to take place in that city.If, as I assume, you are familiar with the modus operandi of the continuingchild-abuse witch-hunt epidemic around the United States, you know that a commontactic isto invent “crimes” tailored to whatever circumstances of the victim of thewitch-huntcan be discovered or guessed at. The more a broad-brush “map” of my location andactivities is provided to individuals such as Adams-Thompson and those with asimilarvested interest in fabricating a case against me, the easier it is forallegations to beinvented to fit that map. Indeed this appears already to be happening, withAdams-- 410 -Thompson apparently trying to re-date his original allegations to May-July 1986andhoping that no one will notice.(12) Both Mrs. Aquino and I have always been willing to be interviewed by theCID.We will answer all questions for which we are satisfied the CID has a reasonablebasisto ask. If no such basis is apparent to us, then we will ask the CIDinvestigator toexplain the basis and will discuss the facts surrounding that basis with theinvestigator,yourself, and Captain Hayes until the basis is either validated or invalidated.In my 6 March 1989 letter to General Cromartie208 , which to date has goneunanswered, I said that I would consider initiating an Inspector Generalcomplaint andan EEO complaint concerning the conduct of this investigation if, despite thefactswhich have long since established my innocence and the criminal culpability ofAdams-Thompson, I continue to be investigated and Adams-Thompson continues to besheltered against accountability for his criminal actions.I have discussed this matter in detail with the Trial Defense Service, and I amadvised that I have strong grounds for both complaints. In fact I have beenadvised toproceed immediately with both complaints. I have decided to postpone a decisiononthis matter pending developments in the next few weeks. If I have reason tobelievethat the CID is merely moving slowly and cautiously because of the political andpublicvolatility of this case, and that an honest effort is indeed being made toresolve itfactually and justly, then I would not want to complicate the situation evenfurther withtwo investigations of the CID’s actions to date in the court-martialinvestigation ofAdams-Thompson and in the current investigation. On Captain Hayes’ advice,however, I am keeping the Office of the Inspector General and the EEO ARPERCENinformed of the current situation.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt.

S. Army Criminal InvestigationCommandPresidio of San Francisco, CA 94129-6600SUBJECT: Memorandum for Record, LTC Michael A. Aquino, CPT Thomas Hayes, Ms.Betty Narvaez, May 18, 1989MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD: MAY 18, 1989On Thursday, 18 May 1989, at about 0900 hours, LTC Michael A. Aquino called meat my office. LTC Aquino said that he had just had a phone conversation with hislawyer, CPT Hayes. Based on the telephone conversation with CPT Hayes, LTCAquinodecided that he should call me to discuss the questions that I had raised withCaptainHayes on May 17, 1989. Although I discussed the case with CPT Hayes on May 17,1989,I did not solicit the phone call by LTC Aquino. Since LTC Aquino indicated thatthe callwas based on an earlier consultation with his lawyer, I asked LTC Aquino some ofthequestions that I had not asked during the earlier interview.BACKGROUND: On March 16, 1988, Detective Glenn Pamfiloff, San FranciscoPolice Department, interviewed Angelique Jefferson. This interview was taperecorded.At pages 16-17, Angelique states that she remembered four items from the timesheobserved ritualistic abuse of children, conducted by LTC and Mrs. Aquino: (1)shinyblack lion-like statue; (2) white furry carpet; (3) bamboo furniture; and (4) anoldfashioned tub, that one could see underneath. While Special Agents Penaluna andCates, Captain Hayes and I were in LTC Aquino’s apartment in Saint Louis, LTCAquino showed us how his crystal ball worked and gave a tour of his ritualchamber.We observed a prominently displayed shiny black panther statue in LTC Aquino’sritualchamber beneath the altar. The statue was about eighteen inches tall. Thelion-likestatue was the only statue in the ritual chamber. None of the fourcharacteristicsallegedly observed by Angelique Jefferson appeared in any of the FBIphotographs, oron the television program, “Nightmare at the Presidio”.I asked LTC Aquino about the statue of the black panther that is in his ritualchamber in his apartment in Saint Louis. LTC Aquino said that he purchased thestatueabout 2 months ago in connection with the Reserve Officers Wives’ Club sale heldinSaint Louis, and he did not have a black lion-like statue in his apartment orhismother’s apartment in 1986. LTC Aquino said that he would attempt to obtain- 412 -corroboration of this fact, then LTC Aquino would call me back. LTC Aquinofurtherrelated that the reason he purchased the statue was because Lilith liked blackcats. LTCAquino also said that he paid $70 for the statue, and thought that he paid cash,ratherthan by check or credit card. LTC Aquino indicated that there was white carpetthat was“fuzzy” in 1986 in his mother’s apartment at 123 Acme Avenue. This was the sameapartment that LTC Aquino moved into in January-February 1986. LTC Aquino wasnot sure whether there was bamboo furniture in his mother’s apartment. LTCAquinowas sure that he did not have an old fashioned tub that a person could seeunderneath.LTC Aquino said that this white carpet was very worn and therefore he had itreplacedit in 1986.I asked LTC Aquino whether the front of his apartment building on Acme Avenuechanged in 1986 or 1987, and LTC Aquino indicated that the exterior of theapartmentwas repainted; however, the painter used the same colored paint. (In other wordstherewas no significant change in the exterior of 123 Acme Avenue between early 1986andKinsey’s viewing of the apartment exterior in August 1987, when she was with theFBI.)LTC Aquino indicated that the two most significant furnishings in his home orhismother’s home in San Francisco were the white “Greek” statue of a male figureand theEgyptian throne type chair that has the carved lion figure heads on the arms.Bothitems appear in the FBI photographs taken in 1987. The statue of the male figurewasmade by LTC Aquino’s mother in the 1930s, and has been in her apartment at 123Acme Avenue for years. According to LTC Aquino, the Egyptian throne has alsobeenLTC Aquino’s property for more than three years, and LTC Aquino felt that achildwould recognize these furnishings if they had previously seen his apartment.However,LTC Aquino also felt that if a child claimed to recognize the Egyptian throne,it wouldnot be significant because the Egyptian throne had been prominently displayed ontelevision.I asked LTC Aquino about the black masses that he conducted or attended. LTCAquino said the black mass described by Wayne West as reprinted in Appendix 7 ofLTC Aquino’s book, The Devil’s Own was conducted in 1970. The West black mass,which included a female in a nun’s habit urinating into a chamber pot in frontof theother ritual participants so that the urine could be sprinkled on thoseattending theblack mass utilizing a phallic shaped object did occur generally in accordancewithWest’s description in The Devil’s Own. LTC Aquino related that the lady that wassupposed to urinate into the chamber pot thought that she should drink alot offluidsprior to the ceremony to insure that she could urinate at the proper time in theceremony. When the time came for her to urinate, she just kept urinating,delaying theceremony. Anton Levey cast a spell which apparently helped to cause the flow ofurineto stop. The spell caused those attending the black mass to laugh considerably.TheWest black mass was conducted under the direction of LTC Aquino, in 1970, atAntonLevey’s house in San Francisco.- 413 -LTC Aquino conducted “one or two” other black masses as late a 1972 in Kentucky.These masses lacked some of the sexuality of the mass described by West in TheDevil’sOwn and may not have included the use of a nude woman with spread legs, toreceivethe host, utilized as the “living altar.”LTC Aquino indicated that the wands seized in the search of his apartment werenotplaced into any bodily orifices at ceremonies.MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD: MAY 18, 1989On Thursday, 18 May 1989, at about 0940 hours, CPT Thomas Hayes, U. S. ArmyTrial Defense Service, called me at my office. CPT Hayes told me that he had aphoneconversation with his client, LTC Aquino, about an hour ago and wanted todiscuss anyquestions that I might have regarding the investigation of the allegationsagainst LTCAquino. I related that I had just talked to LTC Aquino, and CPT Hayes said thatit wasall right for me to question his client without going through CPT Hayes. I toldCPTHayes what LTC Aquino said in the phone conversation that I had just completed.CPTHayes said he did not object to future conversations by me with his client, LTCAquino.MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD: MAY 18, 1989On Thursday, 18 May 1989, at about 1030 hours, LTC Michael A. Aquino called meat my office. LTC Aquino said that I should call Betty Narvaez, apparent ownerof“Betty’s Folly”, whose name appeared on a sticker on the bottom of the blackstatue ofthe panther. LTC Aquino said that Betty Narvaez could be reached at (314)831-0215.LTC Aquino measured the panther statue and said that it was 21.5 inches tall.LTCAquino also said that the ritual with the chamber pot and the urinating woman inanun’s habit was not used in the ritual(s) in Kentucky. LTC Aquino was unsurewhethera nude woman was used as a living altar in Kentucky, but thought that probablytheywere not because the altar by the Church of Satan at that time, in Kentucky, wasprobably not strong enough to support the weight of an adult female.MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD: MAY 18, 1989On Thursday, 18 May 1989, at about 1045 hours, I called Ms. Betty Narvaez, of“Betty’s Folly”, at (314) 831-0215. I described LTC Aquino and his allegedpurchase ofthe black panther. Ms. Betty Narvaez recalled the purchase by LTC Aquino,stating thatshe recognized LTC Aquino from news programs. Her calendar showed that thepurchase occurred on March 10, 1989, at an Reserve Officers Wives’ Club Sale inSaintLouis. Betty said that she had personally created the mold for the statue yearsago, andthat similar statues using her mold of a panther had been sold throughout theUnitedStates. Betty said that LTC Aquino could have easily obtained a similar statue,and hadit in his home in California in 1986. Nevertheless, LTC Aquino had not given heranyindication that he had such a statue prior to March 10, 1989.- 414 -Appendix 52: Letter #1, Michael Aquino toMajor Mark Harvey 5/31/89May 31, 1989Dear Major Harvey:Captain Hayes has just FAXd me a copy of your Memorandum for Record of May 18,1989. I have some corrections, clarifications, and comments concerning it:(1) I do not think that it is appropriate for you to call my black pantherstatue “lion-like” when, immediately above, you quoted the Jefferson child as using thatexactphrase. [Did the Jefferson child in fact use that exact phrase, or did she justsay “lion”,or did Pamfiloff use the term “lion” and just get some kind of acknowledgmentfrom thechild?] In any case, a black panther is not “lion-like” any more than it is“tiger-like”.Panthers are black and have no mane, while lions are golden tan and have a mane.[This may seem “picky” of me, but my experience to date in this two-yearinvestigativeordeal is that even the vaguest hint of anything which could be possiblyinterpreted as a“link” is quick to be blown up out of all proportion to common sense.](2) Only two front rooms of my mother’s flat had the remains of whitewall-to-wallcarpet in them when Mrs. Aquino and I moved upstairs in January 1986. I say“remains” because, as I told you previously, my mother was very adamant aboutnotchanging anything in her flat during her later years. The carpets were in goodconditionat the time of their installation prior to my birth in 1946. By January 1986they were asflat as runner-rugs and completely threadbare. During the last months of mymother’sstay at home during her fight with cancer, she was increasingly unable tocontrol herbody, and the carpets were discolored accordingly despite daily cleaning. WhenMrs.Aquino and I moved upstairs, therefore, these two carpets were thrown outimmediately. On 1/18/86 I purchased the bright red and green rugs for those tworooms that appear in the photographs (Standard Brands sales invoice #795736,copyavailable) and put them in the two rooms until we could paint them.(3) Since your question about bamboo furniture caught me by surprise, and sincemy mother had a great deal of furniture of all kinds in her flat, my initialresponse toyou was that I was “not sure”. I have since had time to recall her furnishingsin detailand can state categorically that she had no bamboo furniture in the past fewyears.There was none in the flat when we moved into it, nor upstairs in the two roofrooms.As for Mrs. Aquino and myself, we dislike bamboo or rattan-type furniture and donotown any of it [and did not during our 1980-86 residence in San Francisco].- 415 -(4) Both tubs at 123 Acme, upstairs and downstairs, are modern in design andflushto the walls and floor. Both were installed by my mother many years prior toMrs.Aquino’s and my moving to San Francisco. The downstairs tub is at the pointwhere theporcelain is wearing off through many years of use. The condition of theupstairs tub isbetter, but the type and condition of the tub itself, the fixtures attached toit shouldclearly establish that it predates 1980.(5) I am not certain what the significance is supposed to be of your statement:“There was no significant change in the exterior of 123 Acme Avenue betweenearly1986 and Kinsey’s viewing of the apartment exterior in August 1987, when she waswiththe FBI.” In several sworn statements and letters I have pointed out thefallacies of that“viewing trip”, among them:• Almond was not taken to the house where she allegedly told investigators shewas driven to, i.e. “Mr. Gary’s house”. Why was she not driven there for an“identification”?• Almond was not shown several streets or buildings at random during the“identification trip”. She was driven directly to 123 Acme and then “walked pastit by her mother”.• During the same trip, Almond “identified” the red Isuzu rental car which wehadhad for only a couple of days as the car used for her alleged abduction to “Mr.Gary’s house”.Given the absurdity, inconsistency, and factual inaccuracy of Almond’sstatementsto date, and given the obvious interest of Michele Adams-Thompson in eliciting aresponse from Almond in front of 123, I think that this rehashing of the“identificationtrip” is pointless.(6) “LTC Aquino indicated that the two most significant furnishings in his homeorhis mother’s home in San Francisco were the white ‘Greek’ statue of a malefigure andthe Egyptian throne-type chair that has the carved lion figure heads on thearms.”I recall saying to you that these were two extremely eye-catching items, andthat thethrone (an exact replica of Pharaoh Tutankhamen’s famous golden throne) has beenremarked on by many visitors since I acquired it in the late 1970s. Howeverneither younor I can say that all people, or children, would regard these two articles, andespeciallythe statue, as “the most significant” furnishings. Our home is full of antiques,curios,artwork, and rare magical artifacts. The same room that contains the Tut thronecontains four Imperial Chinese dragon-chairs, a dragon-desk, and a dragon-tablefromthe Pan-Pacific World’s Fair. Many people have been more interested in them thanin- 416 -the Tut throne. Many people have been in our home and made no comment concerningany of the chairs - or the statue, for that matter.As I have remarked before, I am increasingly exasperated with attempts tostretchAlmond’s statement about “a bathtub with lion’s feet” into anything andeverythingconnected with lions [or panthers]. A bathtub is not a chair. A lion’s headcarving on achair is not a lion’s foot on a bathtub. A tiny portion of a painting showingAntonLaVey’s head on the front-view of a sphinx is still not a bathtub with lion’sfeet. We donot and have never had a bathtub with lion’s feet, nor a “plastic lion bathtub”.Thatshould be the end of this line of inquiry.The male statue is not white. It is painted with a pastel paint called“seashell” whichcould not be mistaken for white. Nor is the statue “Greek”. It was created inGermanyby my mother as a young woman, at which time she was studying under the greatGerman sculptor Kolbe. It is rough and Expressionistic as opposed to the smooth,idealized sculpture of Greek and neo-Greek art.I have responded to your comments concerning the Missa Solemnis (Black Mass) ofthe Church of Satan and Temple of Set in another letter to you of this date.(7) “LTC Aquino indicated that the wands seized in the search of his apartmentwerenot placed into any bodily orifices at ceremonies.”The two ceremonial wands belonging to Mrs. Aquino and myself, and purchasedfrom “The Enchanted Crystal” decorative glass shop on Union Street in SanFrancisco,were not “seized in the search”. They were looked at and photographed, but werenottaken.I am utterly revolted at the kind of mind that, when looking at these twobeautifulworks of art, could only propose that they must have been used for “placing intobodilyorifices”. This is one more example of the disgusting misrepresentation of ourreligionby people whose minds are apparently fixed firmly on whatever perversions theycanvisualize. Would you ask a question like this to a Catholic priest about thephallus-likeaspergillum he uses in his religious ceremonies?(8) Since I have never seen one of Betty Narvaez’ statues prior to the one attheARPERCEN sale, I don’t see how she could say that “I could have easily obtainedasimilar statue and had it in my home in California in 1986”. I have no ideawhere herwares may be sold apart from that one store in the St. Louis shopping center, oreven ifthey are available anywhere in San Francisco. I did not have any similar statuein mySan Francisco home. This was clearly evident in the raid, when our home wasthoroughly ransacked and photographed. Why would I have bought another statuefrom her now if I already had one? If I wanted two, why would they not have been- 417 -displayed together as a set? I find this attempt to lead Ms. Narvaez into arandomspeculation about my ability to find her statues around the country as absurd astryingto transform lion-footed bathtubs into chairs: once again an attempt tomanipulate theanswer to an easily-dispensed-with question into something that insinuatesexactly theopposite.I have freely, truthfully, and candidly provided information to the CID on anyandall questions that occurred to you - even those which clearly ranged beyondspecificallegations to all areas of my personal, professional, and religious life. Ihave done soon the assumption that your investigation was and is a dispassionate andnon-weightedsearch for the truth. It concerns me when I see indications that there is somesort of“lust for the hunt” here: that in the absence of any evidence whateversupportingAdams-Thompson’s attack on my wife and myself, even the most outlandish andpreposterous speculations are advanced as “something, anything to cling to”. Ihopethat this is not the tone of this investigation, and that in raising theseissues you weremerely clearing the air of questions which, however ridiculous, others hadraised toyou.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military Intelligencecc-Captain Thomas Hayes- 418 -Appendix 53:Letter #2, Michael Aquino toMajor Mark Harvey 5/31/89May 31, 1989Dear Major Harvey:Your memorandum of May 18, 1989 evidences your continuing interest in the MissaSolemnis (Black Mass) ritual of the Church of Satan as contained in Appendix #7of myChurch of Satan documentary history. While I have discussed the nature andpurposeof that religious ceremony in the chapter of COS to which that appendixpertains, Ishould like to make some additional points concerning it.(1) The Black Mass was and is an official, formal religious ceremony of theChurch ofSatan and the Temple of Set. As you know, it is not the ritual-murder ceremonydescribed in Huysmans’ La-Bas novel (the “stereotype Black Mass” of popularmyth),but rather a psychodrama composed by Priest Wayne West for the Church of Satan.Itof course involves no criminal or immoral activity whatever.Our Black Mass possesses the same religious significance, and enjoys the sameConstitutional protection, as any other religious ceremony in any other legally-recognized and credentialled church. While it was employed more by the Church ofSatan than it has been by the Temple of Set, it forms a part of our religiousheritageand, as such, is considered as sacred a practice as any other religious ceremonyformally observed by the Temple of Set.(2) At the time I presided at the 1970 Black Mass, I was an ordained Priest oftheChurch of Satan and as such was expected to perform official ceremonies of theChurchfor its membership. I was specifically asked to preside over the 1970 Black Massat theCentral Grotto of the Church by Anton LaVey, High Priest of the Church. This isnodifferent from the responsibilities of priests, ministers, pastors, and rabbisfrom otherreligions, who are expected and required to conduct religious services for theirrespective congregations.(3) The Black Mass - including the one in 1970 at which I presided as recountedinThe Church of Satan - was not performed as a pageant for non-members of theChurchof Satan. It was not performed for money, nor for mere entertainment, nor foranyulterior purpose. It was performed for the explicit reasons discussed in AntonLaVey’sSatanic Rituals, as well as for those discussed in my Church of Satan history.Onlyadults who were members of the Church of Satan were in attendance, and these byprior request and invitation only.- 419 -In the Satanic Rituals, in the section concerning the Black Mass, LaVey writes:“While [the Black Mass] maintains the degree of blasphemy necessary to make iteffective psychodrama, it does not dwell on inversion purely for the sake ofblasphemy,but elevates the concepts of Satanism to a noble and rational degree. Thisritual is apsychodrama in the truest sense. Its prime purpose is to reduce or negate thestigma acquired through past indoctrination. It is also a vehicle forretaliationagainst unjust acts perpetrated in the name of Christianity.” [Emphasismine.]Allow me to discuss these two points in some detail:(a) Reduce past indoctrination: The Satanic/Setian religion has always placedgreat importance on freeing the individual from crippling, self-destructivesuperstitionand indoctrination. By satirizing and lampooning a vehicle of psychologicalcontrol andintimidation used by a Satanist’s former religion to keep him docile andfearful, wedemonstrate the impotence of that vehicle and effectively free the individualfrom itsdomination. [I have gone into this principle in considerable detail in therelevantchapter in COS.]It is for this reason that, as I believe I mentioned to you during your St.Louis visit, aBlack Mass is tailored to its participants and audience by the officiatingPriest. A BlackMass employing Christian symbolism would not be appropriate for persons withcrippling inhibitions or superstitions stemming from Buddhist or Moslemindoctrination. The Christian-symbolism Black Mass, however, was naturally mostappropriate within a Church of Satan membership which had generally come from aChristianity-conditioned background.According to Captain Hayes, you are bothered by the element of humor in theBlackMass over which I presided, the implication presumably being that such humorsomehow casts doubt on its being a sincere religious ritual. Nothing could befurtherfrom the truth. As discussed above, one of the prime purposes of the ritual istoeliminate fear [of the deity whose wrath was previously used to threaten anindividualwith pre-or posthumous punishment for “blasphemy”]. The ability to laugh at asacredcow is thus important, indeed crucial. All religious ceremonies of the Church ofSatanand Temple of Set enjoyed an atmosphere of pleasant and fearless spontaneity,whereinit was never felt necessary to “march to robotlike choreography”. If somethingamusingoccurred - like Anton LaVey’s making “magical signs” to dissuade the “nun” fromexceeding her role - it was no “sin” to chuckle at it. Nor did it prevent thesameceremony from returning to complete seriousness the next minute. And this bringsmeto the second point:(b) Retaliation against unjust acts perpetrated in the name ofChristianity: If you yourself are a Christian, it may seem insulting to you thatthe- 420 -Church of Satan would practice a religious ceremony that criticizes everythingwhichyou hold most sacred. Permit me to point out, however, that the gander is moreat faultthan the goose in this instance: Christianity has been hurling the most vehementandunjustified abuse at Satan in its rituals, literature, statements, and actionsfor the pasttwo thousand years. The Black Mass is a reaction and response to this; it is notanunprovoked initiative.Although Christian intolerance and persecution of “heretics” date fromantiquity,attacks on nonChristians grew steadily. More times than can be counted thepopulations of conquered “heathen” cultures were given the choice to convert orbe putto the sword. Wars such as the Crusades were regularly funded and fought simplytospread this Christianity’s sphere of control.The Middle Ages and the Renaissance witnessed the uninterrupted slaughter ofaccused witches and Satanists throughout Europe. Not content with just killing“infidels” and “heretics”, Christians invented history’s most ghastly torturedevices forprolonging their death agonies: iron masks that were heated red-hot then spikedtovictims’ faces, iron maidens, racks, boots, screws, and backbreaking wheels thatarestill preserved in scores of European museums. If unfortunates survived suchtorture,death by burning at the stake was their reward. The number of accused Sataniststortured and killed in the European witch-craze has been estimated by historiansas atleast 13 million.I could go on about the Thirty Years’ War, the extermination of whole pre-Columbian civilizations, and the Christian pogroms against Jews which set thestage forthe Nazi holocaust of this century. But I trust the point is taken:Christianity’s history isawash in blood - including in major part our blood as Satanists. We have goodreasonto reject it as a terrible plague of intolerance, misery, and cruelty - inhistorical impact astark antithesis to the messages of peace, brotherhood, and love it insists thatitrepresents.Are things better now? Is “modern Christianity” benevolent, harmless, andtolerant?This very investigation, and the concurrent national campaign of hate and liesdirected against our religion, are graphic evidence that, unless held in checkby secularlaws (such as the First Amendment), the more extreme elements of Christianityremainas intolerant of and dangerous to other religions as ever. It is the fanaticelement withinChristianity which accuses the Satanic religion of the most foul, perverted, andsexually-obsessed crimes it can invent. It has shown itself to be utterlycontemptuousof “truth” and “justice” except as it defines them for its own advantage.May I point out again that it is a Christian minister who falsely andmaliciouslyattacked my wife and myself, without the slightest qualms or concern for theharm hehas caused to two innocent strangers - and with arrogant confidence that,because he- 421 -is a Christian minister and a chaplain, the CID would not dare to find faultwith him forattacking a Satanist. Obviously he regards you as politically obedient tools -lessdramatic than the rack or the iron maiden, to be sure, but just as effective indestroyinga non-Christian religion within an Army which he regards as an essentiallyChristianpreserve. It commissions and pays, after all, a Corps of Chaplains which isoverwhelmingly Christian. With government money (which is not supposed tosupportany religion) it builds Christian churches on military bases and fundsactivities insupport of chaplains’ efforts to further Christian indoctrination.As you know from the media reports and other documentation I have provided you,Mrs. Aquino and I have not just been fighting for our good name against themalice ofAdams-Thompson; Satanists across the country and in other countries havesuddenlybeen forced to defend their persons, families, and religion against thissurprising andunbelievably vicious assault - a wave of hate-propaganda and witch-hunts on ascaleunmatched since the Nazis’ campaign against the Jewish religion in the 1930s.As I commented to you in St. Louis, the Temple of Set had thought to put theBlackMass out to pasture in 1975, as a theological statement which had happily becomeobsolete in the tolerant, New-Age atmosphere of the 1970s. All religions, we nowsupposed, could co-exist freely, cooperatively, and constructively. It seems wewerenaïvely over-optimistic. If you are taken aback by the vehemence of the BlackMass,kindly remember the very tangible horrors directed against us which have causedsucha bitter statement to be necessary.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military IntelligenceEnclosure: A Manual of Exorcism 209209 Appendix #54. This was sent to Harvey to illustrate his own religion’s(Catholicism) attitudetowards Satanism.- 422 -Appendix 54: Catholic Church Rite of Exorcism210A Manual of ExorcismVery Useful for Priests and Ministers of the ChurchThe victim may be possessed by the Devil in two ways, namely: per obsesionem,andper possesionem. Per obsesionem is when the Devil is outside or around thepersonand then torments him with horrible faces, frightening shapes, and in otherways, asthe exorcist will find out by experience. Per possesione m is when the Devil isinside thevictim and possesses him. Then he torments him with blows, pains of the body,etc.This being understood, the symptoms according to Holy Scripture are:First, the lack of obedience of the possessed person, his obstinacy anddisobediencein relation to keeping the law of God and to the things regarding His holyservice. Takethe example of Saul, when David was playing the harp for him. Instead ofthankinghim, Saul threw a lance at him, attempting to take his life.The second is a sudden illness, which excites him to a rage, biting his hands,throwing himself on the ground, in the fire, in the water, putting him in dangerofdepression and of taking his life, as they say about the lunatic of the Gospeland ofothers possessed by the Devil, referred to in Matthew, 8 and 17, Mark, 9, Luke,11 andActs 19.The third is if the afflicted person really shakes and is upset in the presenceof sacredobjects such as the Cross, relics of saints, and also of the exorcist himself.This is moretrue when he is not aware or does not know that there are relics or sacredobjectspresent.Fourth: the hatred that the possessed person has toward spiritual things, suchas notwanting to enter the Church, and if he does enter, leaving immediately, refusingto useholy water or to look at or kiss the statues of the saints and especially theCross. Theycannot say or hear holy words. If they are taken to hear Mass, they feel verydisturbedand despondent. But when they are entirely in their senses, they confess thatthey loveall these things, although with some confusion which hinders and restrains them.Fifth: blaspheming God, His saints and relics; cursing the statues; abusing andinsulting without reason those who accompany them; speaking and understandingLatin without having studied it; discussing the fine points of the deepmysteries of thefaith and holy scripture, although uneducated; discovering and revealing secretthingsand hidden sins that only could be known by the person who committed them. In210 Enclosed with Appendix #53.- 423 -especially ignorant peasants, however, the Devil rarely speaks Latin in order tobetterdisguise his presence and stratagems, or because the language does not help himverywell, as Father Rafael de la Torre says: quia lingua ad unum idioma habituata,est illiobedentior, et ad mutus illi placentes, explained in Question 90, article 2. 211The symptoms which the authorities list for recognizing possession by the Devilareof three types. Some only arouse suspicion, others great conjecture, and othersareconclusive. Those which only arouse suspicion are: sudden change of personality,suchas having been a very pleasant, loving, quiet and peaceful person and now verybelligerent and wild, given to disputes and quarrels, etc. They may haveunusual,recurrent nightmares in which they have made a pact with the Devil or havecalled onhim for service and help. Many times these symptoms are not conclusive, but inconjunction with others they give rise to great caution.Those manifestations which cause great suspicion are: unaccustomed howling andhearing voices, horrible and ferocious visions; absence of feeling in the limbs,a loss ofalmost all the vital processes, and an extraordinary restlessness so that thesick personcannot be quiet and seeks out dark and solitary places. He may have an enduranceandstrength which exceed human power. He may also throw himself on the ground or inthe water attempting to end his life, etc.Those signs which are conclusive are: suddenly speaking foreign tongues orreading,writing and singing in ingenious ways without any special grace or miracle ofGod, andrevealing secrets or noteworthy things which happened in foreign countries. Inorderfor these symptoms to be conclusive, there must be no agreement with the Devil,ashappens with wizards, who discover and reveal secrets without being possessed bytheDevil. If, when they come to their senses, they cannot remember what they havesaid,or if they are told to be quiet and do not obey, it is a sign that it is theDevil who isspeaking. Likewise, if the person blasphemes in the presence, of sacred objects,orcannot say a prayer or tolerate having holy water put on him or having the signof thecross made on his forehead, or hearing the exorcisms, the gospel or this verseof thecanticle of Moses: Deum, qui te genuit, dereliquisti, oblitus es Dominicreatoris tui212 ,or the other: da laudem, et gloriam Deo213 .211 “quia...” because a tongue accustomed to a single language is more obedientto him [sc. a demon].212 “Thou hast forsaken the God that begot thee, and hast forgotten the God thatcreated thee.”213 “Give praise and glory to God.

Now is he touching you with divinelashes, in whose presence, trembling with your legions and crying out, you said:“Whathave we to do with thee, Jesus, the Son of the most high God? Art thou come heretotorment us before our time?” (Mk. 1.24; 5.7). He is spurring you with unceasingflames,who at the end of time will say to the wicked: “Depart from me, ye cursed, intoeverlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.” (Mt. 25.41)For youand your angels there will be undying worms. For you and your angels anunextinguishable fire is being prepared: because you are the inventor ofdamnablemurder, the author of incest, the origin of sacrilege, the teacher of depraveddeeds, the- 429 -instructor of heretics, the inventor of all obscenity. Therefore, depart, wickedanddepraved , depart with all your tricks, for God has willed man to be his temple.Here the exorcist can strike the possessed person on the shoulders with thestole.But why do you stay here longer? Give honor to God the Father almighty + to whomevery knee bows. Make room for the Lord Jesus Christ who poured out his sacredbloodfor man. Make room for the Holy Spirit + who through his blessed apostle Peteropenlyhumbled you in Simon the magician; who condemned your tricks in Ananias andSaphiras; who smote you giving honor to God in King Herod; who through hisapostlePaul ruined you with the mist of blindness in Elymas the magician and bade youin aword to depart from the Snake Woman and perish. Now therefore depart +, depart,seducer. The underworld will be your home; your dwelling-place a serpent, tocreepand grovel. Now is no time for delay. For behold, the triumphant Lord approachesquickly, and before him will burn a fire which shall precede him and consume hisenemies round about. For though you might have fooled man, you cannot mock God.He casts you out, from whose eyes nothing is hidden. He expels you, to whosepower allthings are subdued. He shuts you out, who has prepared an everlasting Gehennaforyou and your angels. From his mouth shall come forth a sharp sword, and he willcometo judge the living and the dead and the world by fire. Amen. (Apoc. 1:16;19.15)Next he will say the Magnificat , and when it is finished he will say thefollowingexorcism.May the undefiled Mother of God crush you and your pride, O apostate angels, sheto whom the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee calledNazareth toannounce, after a salutation, the conception of the Lord by saying: “Behold,thou shaltconceive and shalt bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; heshall begreat, and shall be called the Son of the most High. This shall happen by theHoly Spiritcoming over thee and the power of the most High overshadowing thee.” And Maryanswered: “Behold Mary, the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me accordingtothy word.” (Lk. 1.26)May she crush you and your pride who, when she found herself growing great withchild arose and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda, andshe enteredinto the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass that whenElizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb, andElizabethwas filled with the Holy Spirit and she cried out saying: “Blessed art thouamongwomen, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.”May she conquer you and all your pride, who nine months after conception, whileallthings were in quiet silence and the night was in the midst of her course (Wis.- 430 -18.14/15), brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him up in swaddlingclothesand laid him in a manger because there was no room for him in the inn.May she confound your boldness who remained a virgin before, during, and afterchildbirth.May she blunt your impudence, in whom was ended the famous word of Eve’sunhappiness: “In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children,” (Gen. 3.16) for shebroughtforth the Lord in gladness. Eve sorrowed, but she rejoiced. Eve carried tears inherbelly, but she bore inner joy: for the one gave birth to a sinner, the other aninnocentand liberator of sinners. May she move against you by her achievements, whoselying-in was the beginning of salvation and signaled joy throughout the world: for sheis theflower of the field from whom arose the precious lily of the valley, by whosebirth theearlier order of creation was changed and guilt was extinguished; for from heris arisenthe sun of justice, Christ our God, who by loosing the curse brought down theblessing,by confounding death endowed us with eternal life.May she put you to flight, who in Cana of Galilee as the wine gave out said toherson: “They have no wine,” (Jn. 2.3) and then to the servants: “Whatsoever heshall sayto you, do ye.” May she cast you out to the places suitable to you, O corruptersof awounded mind; she who stood with Mary of Cleophas and Mary Magdalene by thecross of Jesus Christ her son, who as he saw her said: “Woman, behold thy son.”(Jn.19.6) then he said to his disciple John: “Behold thy mother.” And from that hourthedisciple received her into his own.May she cast you down to suitable places, who, when she had paid off the debt oftheflesh and was overcome by death, was taken up to the heavenly bridal chamber inwhich the king of kings sits on a starry throne.Finally, may she drive you out, who just as Christ’s magnificance is liftedabove theheavens so is she raised above the choirs of angels to the realms of heaven.Trusting inher merits and prayers and by the authority of her son I command you to departinhaste and leave this creature of God loose and free of every wicked trick.How long will you stay? Why do you linger? What are you bold enough to think?Take flight, you rebels against everlasting majesty; give way, you damned, toGod anddepart from this image of the holy Trinity for the places which God has preparedforyou.Here the exorcist will ask the demon why he does not want to leave, and he canproceed.Say the litany of the saints, and when it is finished:- 431 -Christ hear us.

Again I command you to obey my orders under penalty of going foralltime to the pool of fire and sulphur from the mouth of which comes out a sharptwo-edged sword, and may it devour you through all time according to God’s ordinanceinthat loathsome place.- 432 -I conjure you further by the aforementioned pains and by hundreds of thousandsmore, steadily increasing, to obey my earlier instructions; and this I commandnot bymy own power and authority but in the name of him who cast you out of heaven foryour pride and envy, and with the support of the faith and sanctity of thechurch forwhich I act as agent. Furthermore, I admonish all the princes and masters andeveryenemy who might have power over you: that (lest you overlook these imminentpenalties and others in hundreds and hundreds of thousands, and thousands ofhundreds of thousands, constantly increasing) should they not force youimmediately,without delay, and instantly to obey my commands and then actually to departfromthe body of this creature, N., and should you not obey: I will bring against youthesentence of your damnation, excommunication, and condemnation in the pool offireand sulphur throughout eternity.I curse and excommunicate, I cast out and smite you damned devils in the powerofthe most holy Trinity, the Father +, the Son +, and the Holy + Spirit.May God the Father curse you, may God the Son curse you, and God the HolySpirit;and may all your enemies among the devils and your leader Satan cast you out andsmite you; be you cursed in this body and outside it, in the air, water, fire,earth, orwherever else you will be; and may you suffer intolerable pains and exceedinganguishunless you withdraw at once, with all your wicked tricks, from the body of thiscreature,N., never to return again. 214214 I daresay this Rite of Exorcism was effective, because I can’t think of anydæmons known to mewho would sit still for more than a few minutes of this excruciating drivel.- 433 -Appendix 55:Letter, Captain Thomas Hayes toCommander 6RCID 5/31/89Department of the ArmyUS Army Trial Defense ServicePresidio Field OfficePresidio of San Francisco, California 94129AFKC-ZM-JA-TDS (27-10)31 May 1989MEMORANDUM THRUCommand Judge Advocate, Headquarters 6th Region, Criminal Investigation DivisionCommand, Presidio of San Francisco, California 94129FOR Commander, Headquarters, 6th Region, Criminal Investigation DivisionCommand, Presidio of San Francisco, California 94129SUBJECT: Request to Review CID File Prior to Titling Decision1. I write in my capacity as defense counsel to make an unusual request. I havebeenin contact with your Command Judge Advocate, MAJ Mark Harvey, for many weeksmonitoring the progress of the ongoing investigation of LTC Michael Aquino. Iattended two exhaustive days of recorded interview with CID Agents Dan Cates,StevePetaluna and MAJ Harvey at LTC Aquino’s home in St. Louis. Because this is suchanunusual case and the potential harm to LTC Aquino is so great, I request that hebeprovided a copy of the investigation before you, as the Region Commander, make adecision on whether my client should be placed in the title block of the report.2. The case involves many bits and pieces of facts. The very nature of theallegationsmade by Chaplain Adams-Thompson through his daughter Kinsey, are so repugnantthat it is easy to allow one’s focus to shift from reality. Kinsey’s lengthyramblings toher psychologist, LTC Hickey, and the suspicious notes made by her m o t h e r ha v ebeen the grains from which many of the CID’s concerns arose.3. Recently MAJ Harvey was concerned at having seen a statue of a panther at LTCAquino’s home in St. Louis. It appears that one of the children reported havingseen astatue of a lion in the place where abuse was alleged to have occurred. LTCAquinoimmediately responded to MAJ Harvey’s concern with a record of where hepurchasedthe statue and the price paid long after he moved from San Francisco. Smalldetails- 434 -such as these that cause concern must be put to rest if there is to be a fairand justtitling decision.4. I request that the CID provide LTC Aquino a copy of the draft report prior toyourfinal decision on titling. Even after a lengthy interview, there still may bebothersomequestions. LTC Aquino only asks that he be given an opportunity to meet theseconcerns with answers and documentary evidence. If CID regulations wouldprohibityour office from producing a copy of the report for me before it is “final”, LTCAquinocan arrange to review it at the Granite City, Illinois office. The CID couldonly becommended by those truly interested in the truth for arranging such a review.Pleaseask MAJ Harvey to call me when you have decided whether or not to honor thisrequest./s/ Thomas M. Hayes IIICaptain, Judge AdvocateSenior Defense Counsel- 435 -Appendix 56: Letter, Michael Aquino toColonel Webster Ray 6/20/89June 20, 1989Colonel Webster D. Ray, Commander6th Region USACIDCPresidio of San FranciscoSan Francisco, CA 94129Dear Colonel Ray:Captain Hayes of the Trial Defense Service has advised me of the following threerecent developments:(1) That your headquarters has denied my request to be permitted to review theinvestigative report concerning me for objectivity and accuracy prior to yourmaking adecision whether or not to title me based upon it.(2) That Major Harvey, your Region Judge Advocate, has told Hayes that there isnothing in the report on which court-martial charges against me couldconceivably besupported.(3) That Harvey has told Hayes that he nevertheless fully expects that I will betitledfor the accusations by Chaplain Adams-Thompson anyway.This surprising third statement by Harvey has prompted me to write this letter.Please permit me to speak candidly:I am under no illusion whatever that either you or anyone else in the CIDinvestigative or command structure thinks for a moment that I had anything to dowitheither the Adams-Thompson child or any other child. The evidence of myinnocence,and of Adams-Thompson’s deliberate malice in attacking Mrs. Aquino and myself,isboth obvious and explicit.Therefore, if Harvey’s statement to Hayes is correct, the facts of the case areandalways were irrelevant to any decision to title. Rather it appears that it wasintendedfrom the beginning that I be titled, and that Adams-Thompson’s many violationsofUCMJ #133 simply be ignored, no matter what the investigation itself might bringtolight. From FOIA papers I have recently received from the government, it isevidentthat this CID investigation was ordered in November 1988 as a consequence ofpublicand Congressional pressure to “deal with me” [in the words of one DA document]- 436 -following my appearance on Geraldo Rivera’s October 25, 1988 “Satanism” specialtodefend the legitimacy and ethics of my religion.Evidently it was ordered that I be titled regardless of the outcome of theinvestigation in order to give the Army a lever to force me out of activeservice, eitherby threatening me with court-martial charges if I would not leave voluntarily orbyusing the titling as an excuse for administrative expulsion. The Adams-Thompsonallegations, revived after being ignored by the CID for over a year, merelyserved as anavailable excuse. Whether or not this chaplain maliciously attacked an innocentofficerand his wife is not deemed a problem which would trouble the Army. A finding bythe.CID that a Christian chaplain committed a criminal act against a Satanist,however,would create a major public relations problem in which Christian activistsaround thecountry could be expected to criticize the Army vehemently and vociferously forsuchan “outrage”.I therefore perceive a situation in which a decision has been made to force meout ofuniform so that the Army will no longer have to endure the thepolitically-awkwardsituation of having an active senior officer who is also a Satanist, the factthat he is asethical as any other officer notwithstanding. On one hand, the DA Public AffairsOfficewill continue to issue statements, as it has, that my religious rights under theFirstAmendment are being scrupulously respected by the Army. On the other hand, atitlingaction will be used to force me out behind the scenes, ostensibly on groundsthat havenothing to do with the First Amendment.Obviously I do not expect you to confirm this scenario. I simply place it on thetableas what I now understand the true situation to be. It is the purpose of thisletter tocommunicate my own views on it, for consideration by you and the Department oftheArmy before you undertake any titling decision.First, I appreciate the dilemma in which the Army finds itself - trapped on onehandby the legal requirements of the First Amendment and on the other by outsidepressureto remove me from the Army. I further appreciate that, while the Army makes areasonable attempt to respect civil and religious rights, it also cannot allowpersonalrights to jeopardize the functioning of the Army generally. If individual rightsclashwith the efficiency of the Army, it is ultimately those individual rights whichmust beabridged. That may not be how the law reads, but it appears to be how it isapplied inpractice.I further appreciate that, while knowing of my religion for the last twentyyears, theArmy did not discriminate against me because of it, since the matter had notbecome apublic issue. The attack by Adams-Thompson, coupled with the Presidio witch-huntand the recent general national climate of anti-Satanic hysteria, changed allthat,- 437 -catapulting my presence into just such an issue. It may not have occurred by anyactionof mine, nor by the Army’s, but it is there just the same.I am prepared to cooperate with the Army on the constructive resolution of thissituation, to include leaving active service at the end of my AGR tour ifnecessary.However - and this is why I am writing this letter to you at this point in time-under no circumstances will I leave AGR service quietly if I am framed for afictitious crime. If I am so titled, I will immediately and with all means at mydisposalbring the details of this entire situation, to include the mishandling of thecharges Ipreferred against Adams-Thompson, to all Army, civilian governmental, and publicreview agencies, officials, and private individuals concerned. This will includethewidest possible media exposure, both domestic and foreign. I will also initiateany legalaction against the Army which is available to me.Any attempt to falsely title me in order to either intimidate me or force me outofuniform by administrative manipulation, therefore, will precipitate preciselywhat theArmy presumably wishes to avoid: the explosion of this situation into a nationalscandal of the highest visibility - and ultimately of the greatest embarrassmentto theArmy. I have, after all, the truth and the documented facts to support me - andthemeans to ensure that they are made known. And I will not stop until my name iscleared, no matter how long it takes.To date, while I have responded to media questions as necessary, I haveintentionally avoided discussing the Army’s handling of either theAdams-ThompsonUCMJ charges or the current CID investigation with the press. This was on theassumption that, as Major Harvey originally indicated to me, the currentinvestigationwas a sincere effort by the CID to find the facts - which would inevitablyresult in theclearing of my name, the exposure of Adams-Thompson’s malicious actions, andpresumably the reactivation of the suppressed court-martial charges which Ipreferredagainst him.In other words, I had no reason to discuss the situation with the press orpublic aslong as I believed the Army to be acting in good faith to correct the existinginjustice. IfI now learn that my trust in the CID was misplaced - and that the investigationwassimply an effort to manufacture anything at all, no matter how absurd, whichcould beused to support a titling of me - then I obviously have every justification toexpose suchmisuse of the Army’s criminal investigative machinery to the light of outsidescrutinyand correction.To preclude such a situation, it is not necessary for the CID to compromise itsobjectivity in any way, but simply to base its report and recommendation onpreciselywhat it should be basing them on: the truth. I will therefore not be titled, andthe- 438 -concluding section of the report will state that there is no evidence that I amguilty ofany crime as alleged. Any language short of this - such as “insufficientevidence” - isnot acceptable. [Language like that is merchandised by hate-groups as a de factofinding of “guilty but we can’t prove it”.]I will not make any complaint, nor file any appeal, IG, or other action ifAdams-Thompson is not titled in the report. Obviously he is guilty of a serious crimeagainstMrs. Aquino and myself. But apparently it is politically taboo for the Army topunishhim because of it. He is a Christian chaplain, and the public image he has inconsequence of the Presidio witch-hunt, no matter how ludicrous it may be, is ofanaggrieved parent trying to protect his little girl from kidnapping, rape, andsodomy byDevil-worshipping pedophiles. Furthermore, to hold him officially accountablefor hiscrime would reopen the question of whether the entire Presidio scandal was infact asphony as the other copycat “child-care sex-abuse” scandals which have ravagedthecountry [to include many military installations] for the past several years. TheArmyhas made it clear that it does not dare to ask this question, evidently for fearof publiccriticism by the militant parents who instigated these witch-hunts.Again if I am fraudulently titled, however, this most assuredly will be anadditionalissue which I will insist upon bringing to widest possible official and publicattention,to include the actions of “therapist” Lt. Col. Deborah Hickey in instigating andaggravating the hysteria in the case of the Presidio witch-hunt.If I am not titled, and if the report concludes with a clear “no evidence”statementof exoneration, I will serve the remaining fourteen months of my AGR tour atARPERCEN. My assignment as a resource manager is a low-visibility one, and therehave been no public relations problems either internal to ARPERCEN or within theSt.Louis community which would make it difficult for me to complete my tour.[Indeedboth ARPERCEN and St. Louis generally have been very sympathetic to the ordealwhich Mrs. Aquino and I have endured as a consequence of the Adams-Thompsonattack.]As General Ward, Chief of the Army Reserve, can confirm, I have been nonselectedby the January 1989 AGR continuation board for retention in the AGR program past30August 1990. Since I substantially exceed all legitimate criteria for retention,I interpretthis simply as one more move to force me out of uniform if the titling effortfails. I haveretained an attorney to challenge the board action, and am confident in theoutcomeshould a lawsuit be necessary. If I am not titled and am clearly exonerated,however, Iwould agree not to pursue this challenge, and instead to leave the AGR programon 30August 1990. This date is sufficiently removed from the completion of the CIDreportthat there will be no implication that I “left under threat”.- 439 -Spectacles such as the Geraldo show are now most probably a thing of the past.Withthe exception of a small number of lunatic-fringe groups and individuals, thegeneralpopulace now knows that the “Satanic child abuse” craze was a fraud no differentfromUFO abductions and Uri Geller’s spoon-bending. Therefore my remaining time onactive duty should pass quietly enough.Obviously it is frustrating to me to see my AGR career destroyed by the actionof onemalicious individual, after I have devoted so many years and so much effort toqualifying and conducting myself as a conscientious and professional officer.Adams-Thompson, however, has evidently neutralized my ability to put my skills toeffectiveuse in the AGR program. Therefore it would appear appropriate for me to returntocivilian life - as long as it is quite clear that I am doing so with no dishonorattached tomy name, that of my family, or that of my church.It is, I believe, in the interests of the Army to allow the situation to beresolved inthis way. If it does not bring Adams-Thompson to justice, at least it does notcompoundhis crime. As for my departure from the AGR program at the end of this tour, Iamprepared to treat that as an unfortunate necessity driven by outside politicalforces overwhich neither the Army nor I have control.Sincerely,/s/ Michael A.

Vuono, Chief of Staff, U.S. ArmyMajor General William F. Ward, Chief, U.S. Army ReserveMajor General Eugene R. Cromartie, Commanding General, USACIDCMr. Gary R. Myers, AttorneyCaptain Thomas M. Hayes III, Trial Defense Service- 440 -Appendix 57: Letter, Michael Aquino to Major Mark Harvey 7/4/89July 4, 1989Dear Major Harvey:On June 30 Colonel Webster Ray, Commander of the 6th Region CID, informedCaptain Hayes that he had decided to title me for the allegations made byChaplainAdams-Thompson. Although you had stated to Hayes that Ray would not receive andreview the CID investigative report until the week of June 26th (following Ray’sreturnfrom TDY), Ray further told Hayes that he had made this decision prior todepartingon the TDY. As the report had not been final-typed in its entirety even by thetimeRay spoke to Hayes, it further confirms my impression that the report is merelyincidental to a titling which had been pre-decided no matter what theinvestigationmight bring to light concerning the truth of the situation. Contrary to what yousaid inyour December 14, 1988 letter to Pillsbury, Madison, and Sutro, it now appearsclearthat the sole purpose of this investigation was to build - and if necessaryfabricate - anargument to support that predetermined titling.To date my requests to review the report, both in draft and in final form, havebeendenied. Until I am able to review it, I cannot comment upon its contents. I cancomment, however, upon the contents of its cover-sheet as provided by you toHayes.The following comments apply to Mrs. Aquino as well as myself:“LOCATION OF OCCURRENCE: CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER (CDC), PRESIDIOOF SAN FRANCISCO; 123 ACME AVENUE; 208 DELORES STREET.”(1) I have never been to the CDC nor had any contact with it, and the CID knowsthat there is no evidence to the contrary.(2) There is no evidence whatever that any crime as alleged ever occurred at our123 Acme Avenue home. The pre-publicity “interior descriptions” of 123assembled into a “package story” and attributed to Kinsey Almond by Adams-Thompson were all wrong, and a fraudulently backdated, post-publicity diaryalteration by Mrs. Adams-Thompson to try to support that package story cannotchange that fact. The surprise police raid yielded not a single item ofpedophiliaor anything indicating that I have the slightest interest in or involvement withthis subject. As for the external “identification” of 123 by Almond in thecompany of her mother, her simultaneous “identification” of the rental carwhich the Adams-Thompsons had seen and mistakenly believed to be ours- 441 -reveals both the spuriousness of the “identification” and the obvious coachingofthe infant to “identify on cue. 215(3) As I have never been to 208 Delores Street in my life, nor ever met nor hadanyother contact with Gary Hambright in my life, there can be no evidence to thecontrary.(4) In his initial allegations against Gary Hambright in April 1987, Adams-Thompson specified the CDC as the location. He made no mention of any otherlocation whatever.(5) In her “therapy” sessions with Debbie Hickey, Almond made no single coherentstatement about being taken to any building remotely identifiable as 123 AcmeAvenue. On the other hand, she rambled on about being taken to a variety ofother houses owned by other people and with interior and exterior featurestotally unlike anything at 123.CONCLUSION: All statements in “Location of occurrence” are deliberately falseand unsubstantiated.“DATE/TIME OF OCCURRENCE: ON OR ABOUT MAY-JULY 1986 BETWEEN 0730AND 1600 HOURS.”(1) The period of May-July 1986 passed without Kinsey Almond ever being takenfor the kind of emergency medical care that a 2-year-old who had been rapedand sodomized by 2 men (Chaplain A-T’s package story) would have required.[While my FOIA request for access to the A-T medical records has been denied,it is reasonable to assume that, had any such incident occurred in May-July, theA-Ts would have noticed it immediately, emergency medical care would havebeen required, and the Presidio witch-hunt would have been instigated theninstead of six months later.](2) Similarly the period September-October 1986 passed without Almond beingtaken for such emergency medical care, and without the A-Ts noticing anythingthe least indicative of rape, sodomy, or any other molestation.(3) When ca. April 1987 the A-Ts first decided to participate in the Presidiowitch-hunt by accusing someone (Hambright), they selected September-October 1986.When in August 1987 they decided to switch targets to Mrs. Aquino and myself,215 As of this date I had still not seen, indeed did not know of the existenceof the CID report of that“identification trip” which established that no such “identification” actuallytook place at all. The6RCID, of course, was well aware of that document.- 442 -they retained the September-October 1986 accusation-dates. They retainedthese dates throughout the entire SFPD investigation and media coverage whichfollowed.(4) As it quickly became clear that Mrs. Aquino and I had PCSd from the PresidiotoWashington in July 1986, and had not been present in San Francisco on anydate since then when Almond was at the day-care center, that fact in itselfshould suffice to absolve us from A-T’s accusation. The CID, however, justarbitrarily revised the dates of accusation to fit a time when we werestill in San Francisco prior to PCS. In this agenda-driven investigation,evidently, factual circumstances which disprove the allegations are a prioriunacceptable and must therefore be ignored or quietly altered in the hope thatno one would notice. I did notice.(5) No accuser has provided any evidence whatever that anything criminal tookplace at 123 during the May-July 1986 time period. On the other hand, an ArmyLieutenant Colonel and his wife have stated under oath that nothing criminaloccurred there, and there are no grounds in their lifelong records ofunblemished truthfulness for the CID to impeach their credibility. FurthermoreI provided the CID with the names of U.S. Navy Lt. Commander William Butchand Mr. Christopher Wise (Mrs. Aquino’s brother and son) who lived constantlyat 123 during all of 1986, and the CID never bothered to interview either ofthem. I further provided the CID with the name of my father, Mr. MichaelAquino Sr., who resided with us at 123 in July 1986 prior to our PCS toWashington. The CID never interviewed him either. Five adults with impeccablebackgrounds were present on the 123 premises in the May-July 1986 timeperiod, and all can verify that nothing criminal took place there. Neverthelessthe CID chose to ignore three of these adults and without the slightest cause totreat the other two as liars, simply to perpetuate the myth of a May-July 1986“crime period” that was never the subject of anyone’s originalaccusation.(6) Two other individuals - a painting contractor and a general contractor -werealso on the 123 premises daily throughout the May-July 1986 time period andwere able to verify to the CID that they never saw any children brought thereforany reason, much less sexual abuse ones. Assuming that the CID hasinterviewed both of these individuals as well, there are now seven adults toverify that no crime occurred at 123 Acme Avenue during May-July1986. Yet the CID ignores this.CONCLUSION: The “Date/time of occurrence” which appears on this cover sheetis not that of the actual A-T allegation, but was arbitrarily created by the CIDinthe absence of any such allegation. It is not substantiated by any evidence- 443 -whatever, and is disproved by abundant evidence. It therefore constitutes adeliberate and fraudulent fabrication by the CID.“DATE/TIME REPORTED: 12 AUGUST 1987, 1735 HOURS.”(1) This is the date when Adams-Thompson told his personally-invented “packagestory” to the FBI, telling a different version of it to the SFPD on 14 August1987and a still-different version of it to the CID in 1989. Both FBI and SFPDversions of the original “package story” specified the September-October 1986time period only, and provided no details whatever concerning 123 AcmeAvenue that were accurate.CONCLUSION: The “Date/time reported” is not the time when the “date/time ofoccurrence” was specified, nor when anything to validate 123 Acme as thelocation of any crime was specified. The only thing significant about the “date/time reported” is that on that date Lawrence Adams-Thompson made a viciousattack on two innocent people who didn’t even know him or anyone in hisfamily, and that all of the “evidence” that he offered was ultimatelyestablishedto be wholly invented by him (the “package story”), unverified by examination(the interior of 123 and the physical condition of Almond as an unsodomizedvirgin), and/or falsely attributed to others (attribution of the “package story”toDebbie Hickey).“INVESTIGATED BY: SPECIAL AGENTS STEPHEN PENALUNA AND DANIELCATES.”(1) Although the crimes specified in this accusation are among the most seriousones in society, the CID made no move to investigate them for over a yearfollowing A-T’s attack. It is quite obvious that no one at the CID took theallegations seriously after the abortive SFPD raid and investigation. At no timefrom August 1987 to November 1988 did any representative of the CID evencontact me to inquire about them.(2) In November 1988, immediately after my appearance on the Geraldo Rivera“Satanism” broadcast to defend my religion and the subsequent proliferation ofconfidential DA-level memos exploring options to “deal with” me, I wassuddenly informed by Penaluna that this investigation was being opened.Though Special Agent Birck, Penaluna’s superior, maintained that theinvestigation “had always been open”, it is obvious that this is not the caseandnothing had in fact been investigated in it. [An examination of verifiable time/date-stamped CID documents during August 1987-October 1988 shouldestablish the facts here.] What this indicates is that this investigation wasnot- 444 -opened on the basis of probable cause in August 1987, but was opened on thebasis of a political agenda in November 1988.(3) The name of Major Mark Harvey must also be added to this line, as heparticipated directly in the investigation, to include correspondence with meand frequent discussions with me both by telephone and in person.Identification of all investigators involved is significant because, if it isestablished that the report deliberately conceals, falsifies, distorts, and/oromitsany information crucial to the truth of the matter, the investigators eitherindividually or collectively as appropriate will bear responsibility for such aviolation of their responsibility under the law.“TITLE: CONSPIRACY, KIDNAPPING, SODOMY, INDECENT ACTS OR LIBERTIESWITH A CHILD, INDECENT ACTS, FALSE SWEARING, INTENTIONALNONCOMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 30 UCMJ (MALTREATMENT OF ASUBORDINATE), AND CONDUCT UNBECOMING AN OFFICER.”(1) There is no evidence to substantiate any one of these statements. Allof them are false, and the CID knows full well that all of them arefalse. If Colonel Ray signs this titling action, knowing that it is a completefalsehood and fabrication, he will be guilty of several false officialstatements inviolation of Article 133 UCMJ and of other provisions of the UCMJ againstdefaming another soldier and participating in acts of religious discriminationinviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.(2) CONSPIRACY: There is no evidence whatever that I have conspired withanyone regarding the abduction of or harm to any child.(3) KIDNAPPING: There is no evidence whatever that I have either kidnappedany child or in any way orchestrated such a kidnapping.(4) SODOMY: I have never committed sodomy in my life, and there is noevidence whatever to the contrary. Major Harvey has confirmed to methat Kinsey Almond has been medically examined and found to be free from anysign of rape or sodomy (as her stepfather A-T alleged).(5) INDECENT ACTS OR LIBERTIES WITH A CHILD: There is no evidence that Ihave had any such contact with any child. There is nothing in my life history tosuggest a pedophiliac disposition. Quite the contrary, at such times as I havebeen involved with young people - as for example an Assistant Scoutmaster andNational Commander of the Eagle Scout Honor Society in the Boy Scouts ofAmerica, my contacts with them have always been ethical to an exemplarydegree, frequently resulting in service awards and honors.- 445 -(6) INDECENT ACTS: If this is intended to cover sexual frolics betweenconsentingadults in private, then the CID will need to title every normally-sexed memberof the United States Army. In my particular case, I am not and have never beena homosexual, and where women are concerned I have had sex with only myformer and then my present wife - period.(7) FALSE SWEARING: I have sworn to charges against Adams-Thompson for thefalse and malicious attack he deliberately made against Mrs. Aquino and myself,and I swore to two detailed statements in support of those charges. I furtherswore to a detailed statement responding to CID written questions, and to oralstatements made at the time of a personal interview with Cates, Penaluna,Harvey, and Hayes. Every single one of these statements was andremains the truth, and the evidence and documentation substantiating themas such was provided and explained in careful detail to the best of allinformation available to me. Not a single statement therein wasimpeached to me or to Hayes by the CID at any time.On the other hand, as I have meticulously detailed to the CID, Chaplain Adams-Thompson is guilty of many knowingly false official statements, which is provenby the comparison of his statements of record to the SFPD, FBI, and CID; andby comparison of his allegations to such things as the physical condition of hisstepdaughter and the actual contents of Debbie Hickey’s “therapy” notes. He isan established liar not once, and not by honest accident, but many times overand deliberately so. In concealing this and failing to title him accordingly,theCID is acting to suppress a serious crime which he has committed against afellow officer and his wife - and another crime against the U.S. government, forAdams-Thompson has also filed a fraudulent monetary claim against the"},{"pageContent":"government based upon his knowingly-false allegations.(8) INTENTIONAL NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 30 UCMJ -MALTREATMENT OF A SUBORDINATE: As this has never been mentioned toeither me or Captain Hayes throughout the entire investigation, I assume itrefers to the fact that, using the lawful means available to me as an Armyofficer,I sought to have Adams-Thompson brought to justice for his vicious crimeagainst Mrs. Aquino and myself. As documentation clearly establishes, I firstrequested A-T himself to correct his actions. Then I requested his chain ofcommand to take administrative corrective action where he was concerned.Then, only after exhausting all lesser alternatives and after consultation withthe Command Judge Advocate of my headquarters, I preferred UCMJ chargesagainst him. These charges were based strictly upon the truth as I understood itto be, and were amended on my own initiative in the single instance where onespecification was later shown to be improbable.- 446 -The honest and factually-substantiated invocation of the Uniform Code ofMilitary Justice is the right of every American soldier. The CID has nobusiness whatever titling a soldier for daring to seek justice underlaw.The CID, furthermore, was tasked by the 25th Infantry Division to investigatethe charges I preferred against Adams-Thompson. Beyond the fact that the CIDstated to the 25th Division that there was “no evidence to substantiate thecharges”, there is no indication that the CID conducted any bona-fideinvestigation in support of those charges whatever. My repeated FOIA requestsfor a copy of the “investigation report” have been consistently denied, despitethe fact that I am both the injured party and the officer who signed the chargesheet as preferring official. Furthermore, as has come to light in the course ofthis present investigation, the CID was not only in the position to validate theevidence I provided in support of the charges, but in its own files possessedsubstantial additional information in support of the charges of which it tookno initiative either to inform me or to inform the 25th Division. Therefore theCID acted to suppress evidence of a crime and to prevent that crimefrom being referred for court-martial. 216In a 5-month period - January to May 1988 - the CID claimed to know enoughabout the facts of the Adams-Thompson situation to recommend dismissal ofthe charges against him. At the same time they claimed not to know enoughabout that same situation to keep a “preliminary” investigation open on me andthen in November 1988, following the Geraldo show, to open a 7-monthintensive investigation of me. This makes it quite clear that the CID has beenoperating under a predetermined bias and agenda in which Adams-Thompsonwas prohibited from being found guilty and I was prohibited from being foundinnocent.The titling of “false swearing ... maltreatment of a subordinate”, therefore, isnotonly false in itself, but serves to cover up a serious breach of ethics by theCID inits mishandling and suppression of the UCMJ charges against Adams-Thompson.(9) CONDUCT UNBECOMING AN OFFICER: This phrase has surfaced only oncein the investigation - by Major Harvey, a Catholic, in connection with areligiousceremony of the Church of Satan with which he personally disagrees. It isaxiomatic that individuals of different religions disagree as to rituals andceremonies, but the First Amendment to the Constitution provides that, as long216 At this date I still had not succeeded in obtaining the CID “Report ofInvestigation” (Appendix#32), which verified my contentions here even more conclusively.- 447 -as no criminal acts are committed, adherents of any religion have theabsolute right to worship whatever god they choose, however theychoose. AR 600-20, Paragraph 6-3 further states that:The policy of the U.S. Army is to provide equal opportunity and treatmentfor soldiers and their families without regard to religion [and similar factors]...This policy applies both on and off post, extends to soldiers’ working, living,andrecreational environments (including both on-and off-post housing) ...If Major Harvey or anyone else in the CID seeks to use the UCMJ as a means forreligious persecution, discrimination, or intimidation, therefore, such misuseofthe CID’s titling powers constitutes a clear violation of AR 600-20 [and theConstitution] and is itself an illegal act for which the perpetrator is requiredto be held responsible.CONCLUSION: All statements in the titling line are not only false, butare clearly contrary to the truth as the CID knows it to be. Specificelements of this titling line are deliberately present to conceal misuse of itsinvestigative powers by the CID in the case of the Adams-Thompson UCMJcharges, and to intimidate me [and other Setian/Satanist members of the U.S.Armed Forces] against the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the U.S.Constitution and AR 600-20.This is a “crime” with no victim, as there is no sign of any damage whatever tothechild who was alleged by Adams-Thompson to have been raped and sodomized by twomen. There is no evidence that the child was ever kidnapped or sexuallymaltreated inany way, as would have produced instantaneous injury and emotional distress inthechild at the time of such a traumatic experience.This is a “crime” in which the accuser, after no allegations at the supposedtime ofthe sexual attacks, proposed one perpetrator, then on a malicious whim switchedtotwo others several months later.This is a “crime” in which the accuser, after letting the dates in question passbywithout the slightest comment, clearly specified one set of dates(September-October1986) both in his initial attempt to target Hambright and then in his subsequentattempt to target Mrs. Aquino and myself. When the CID couldn’t make thesedates fit our location, they simply changed them.This is a “crime” in which the accuser arbitrarily switched the location fromone place to another depending simply on whom he was accusing at the moment.Fromthis cover sheet it further appears that the CID has now arbitrarily added athirdlocation on no evidence whatever.- 448 -This is a “crime” with no motive. Neither Mrs. Aquino nor I have any history oftheslightest interest in or involvement with child molestation or mistreatment. Onthecontrary, we have a lifelong record of sterling reputations where contact withyoungpeople is concerned. As is now quite clear to the entire United States - withthe evidentexception of the CID - the Temple of Set is a religious institution whichneither involveschildren in any of its activities nor practices any harmful or illegal activitywhatever.Who, what, when, where, and why: Not one of these established - but rather allexploded by obvious lies, inescapable physical facts, and attempted latter-dayalterations. For a titling such as this to be based upon an investigation suchas this isutterly absurd -and a flagrantly grotesque abuse of the CID’s investigativepowers andresponsibilities.Finally - and most disgracefully - this is a “crime” in which the real criminal,Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson, is being protected against accountability forhisextremely destructive crime, and his associated effort to defraud thegovernment,evidently because the Army simply does not have the courage to call a Christianchaplain to account for an extremely serious crime he committed against asoldier andhis wife who happen to be legitimate Satanists. If this nation considers itselfbetter thanNazi Germany, wherein there was one standard of justice for Christians andanother forJews, then it is incumbent upon us to prove it - not when it is politicallyconvenient todo so, but when the Constitution demands that we do so.The foregoing facts are provided to place the cover sheet to the CID report, anditstitling of me, in the context of the truth which both the CID and all partiesinvolvedknow it to be. These are the facts which will inevitably come out if this falseandfraudulent titling action is not immediately and thoroughly removed. Ideally theCIDshould take the initiative to do this. Otherwise senior officials of the Armywill beforced into a position where they have to defend the CID’s conduct of thisentire affair,which they will ultimately be unable to do - to the national embarrassment anddiscredit of the Army.As stated in my June 20, 1989 letter to Colonel Ray, I am aware of the actualpolitical forces behind this misuse of the CID. While I will not for a momenttoleratebogus criminal titling, I reiterate my willingness to work with the Army towardsaconstructive resolution to this situation which is in the Army’s best interestand whichdoes not compromise my own honor, that of my wife, or that of our religion.Sincerely,Michael A. AquinoLt. Colonel, Military Intelligencecc- Major General Eugene CromartieCaptain Thomas M. Hayes- 449 -Appendix 58: Letter, Michael Aquino toMajor General Eugene Cromartie 8/3/89August 3, 1989Dear General Cromartie:On 7/31/89, having heard nothing further concerning the titling decision, Itelephoned Colonel Ray, CID 6th Region Commander. In answer to my questions, hestated the following:(1) That he has signed the titling action.(2) That before doing so he did read my 6/20/89 letter to him and my7/4/89 fax message to his Region Judge Advocate Major Harveyaddressing and refuting all items on the titling cover sheet. [Copies ofthese were provided directly to you.](3) That when signing the titling action he neither changed nor removedany of the entries on that cover sheet.(4) That he made the decision to refuse my attorneys and/or myself theopportunity to review the CID investigation report despite our havinginformed him that it necessarily contains serious errors and/ordeliberate fabrications if it purports to justify any item on the titlingcover sheet. This request to review the CID report, under anyconditions of security specified by the CID, was made by CaptainThomas Hayes via memorandum to HQ 6th Region dated 5/31/89.(5) That he and he alone takes responsibility for the titling decision, andthat he was not acting on instructions or expectations from youconcerning that decision.(6) That you will now review the report and the titling decision before itsforwarding to the Crime Records Center, and that you have authority toremove the titling decision as part of that review.(7) That he still refuses to grant either myself or my attorneys theopportunity to review the report prior to your review of it, so that, oncemore, we may detail for you the inaccuracies within it.- 450 -I hereby request that you immediately rescind Colonel Ray’s titling action onthegrounds that I am clearly innocent of all crimes as alleged and that there is noevidenceto the contrary.I further advise you that Colonel Ray, in signing this titling action, hasknowinglyand deliberately made a false official statement in violation of Article 133 oftheUniform Code of Military Justice. If each item on the titling cover sheet, asidentifiedand refuted in my 7/4/89 fax message, is to be considered a separate statement,thenColonel Ray has signed his name to twelve separate false statements embracing“time,location, and nature of offense”.Although Colonel Ray has denied me and my attorneys the opportunity to reviewthereport upon which he supposedly based his decision, there is no reason for me toawaitrelease of that report before drawing this conclusion. Exposure and critique ofthereport will merely serve to support the bogus nature of this titling action thatmuchmore conclusively.As soon as I obtain this report which the CID seems so anxious to prevent myexamining, I will immediately request that anything unsubstantiated,discriminatory,or prejudicial in it be removed - through the administrative appeals process,butthrough the federal courts if necessary. Such an action would necessarilyrequire theauthors and signatory of the report to justify each and every item soidentified. If thereport selectively omits information known to the CID which establishes myinnocence,I will request that it be added and the conclusions of the report amended inaccordancewith it.If, when examined in its entirety, the entire report appears to be merely atransparent attempt to frame me in order to give the Army an excuse to harass meandmy wife in violation of our Constitutional rights, to cover up the extreme andinexcusable damage perpetrated by a Christian chaplain - not just to anotherofficerand his wife but to other innocent people and to the Presidio communitygenerally -and/or to cover up the CID’s misuse of its investigative procedures in the caseof thePresidio witch-hunt, the charges preferred against Adams-Thompson, and the post-Geraldo investigation of me, then I will request that the entire report bethrown out.Such a finding, by the Defense Department or the federal courts, wouldpresumably setin motion an appropriate internal investigation of the CID for having allowedsuch anabuse of the investigative process to occur in the first place.Even if the report contains complete fabrications and deliberately manufactured“evidence” concealed from my attorneys and myself, it will be no excuse forColonelRay to claim that he was ignorant of the facts or misled by the report’scontents.Captain Hayes’ 5/31/89 memorandum, my letter to Ray of 6/20/89, and my 7/4/89faxmessage all alerted Ray to the serious inaccuracies in any report whichpurported to- 451 -substantiate a titling of me. He was offered the opportunity to receive myanalysis ofthe report prior to his making a decision, which he refused.It is a matter of documented record that I have cooperated completely,voluntarily,and thoroughly with the CID throughout this entire investigation, providing CIDrepresentatives Major Harvey and Special Agents Cates and Penaluna not only fullandcomplete answers to all of their questions before, during, and after theirtwo-day face-to-face interview, but also abundant correspondence and other documentation tosubstantiate the facts as presented. In an investigation of me lasting ninemonths [ortwo years, if one believes the CID’s statement that it was opened the moment thechaplain made his allegations], not a single allegation or shred of “evidence”has beenproduced which could not be easily refuted and disproved.In addition to my many personal contacts with Major Harvey by telephone andcorrespondence, my attorney Captain Hayes was in continuous contact with Harvey,Cates, and Penaluna concerning the investigation. Prior to the finalface-to-faceinterview here in St. Louis, Hayes requested and was granted access to theinvestigativefile. Had there been any item of “evidence” in it which could possibly havemisled theCID, he would have identified it and I would have addressed it accordingly.During two days of face-to-face interviews involving myself and Mrs. Aquino inSt.Louis, we repeatedly encouraged Harvey, Cates, and Penaluna to ask whateverquestions they wished, even of no demonstrated relevance to the allegations. Theinterviews ceased when the CID investigators indicated that they had no furtherquestions to ask. During the interview session, as in the other contacts withthe CID,not a single statement of mine or Mrs. Aquino’s was impeached despite exhaustivecross-examination by Harvey and Cates. Our substantiation of our innocence, aswehave represented it consistently since the chaplain first attacked us, hasremainedconclusive.During the time between the face-to-face interview and the writing of thereport,both Captain Hayes and I spoke several times with Harvey and/or Cates. A fewadditional questions were asked, which were immediately and thoroughly answeredinfurther verification of my innocence.In short, Colonel Ray has no excuse whatever for the titling decision he made,unless he should state that he made it under duress from higher authorityaccording toa predetermined agenda in intentional disregard of the truth.My previous correspondence to the 6th Region CID and yourself has detailed thefacts in support of my innocence and Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s flagrantviolationsof Article 133 both exhaustively and conclusively. These facts speak quiteadequatelyfor themselves, and there is no reason to repeat them here. I do append to thisletter a- 452 -list of Adams-Thompson’s specific lies, expanded/updated from the list which Ioriginally compiled for CID investigators in May 1989 and updated with my6/20/89letter to Colonel Ray (copy to you). 217The CID knew of many of these actions by Adams-Thompson, as indeed SpecialAgent Cates stated openly to Hayes and myself during our joint review of theoriginaldraft of this list as presented to him during the 5/89 interview. Furthermoreall itemson the list are verified not by my personal supposition, but rather by anexaminationand comparison of official San Francisco Police, FBI, and CID documents andstatements. The CID therefore has no excuse for not acknowledging Adams-Thompson’s crime and titling him accordingly.In January of 1988, after first exhausting all administrative recourse throughhiscommander, I preferred court-martial charges against Adams-Thompson for hismalicious attack on Mrs. Aquino and myself. These charges were dismissed by theCO25th Division on the basis of an official CID statement that “no grounds existtosubstantiate the charges”.As is now quite clear, the CID was at that time in possession not only ofconsiderableinformation to substantiate the points I made in my sworn statement, but also ofconsiderable additional information unknown to me (such as the medically-established completely-unharmed condition of the child alleged by Adams-Thompsonto have been raped and sodomized) to even more conclusively establish myinnocenceand the chaplain’s guilt as charged in Specification #1. The CID’s failure toprovide thisinformation to the 25th Division, or to advise me of it as the officerpreferring thecharges, constitutes an act of misprision of serious offense (Manual for CourtsMartial1984, Part IV, paragraph 95) and an act of deliberate obstruction of justice(MCM IVpara 96), both in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.In connection with that same action, the CID has to date, in violation of Title5 U.S.Code, denied me a copy of the investigative report it states that it preparedconcerningthe charges preferred against Adams-Thompson. In addition to being a violationofTitle 5, this denial is also a violation of Article 134 concerning misprision ofseriousoffense and obstruction of justice, both in the case of the charges againstAdams-Thompson and in the case of the subsequent CID investigation conducted againstme.As the charges against Adams-Thompson were dismissed in May 1988, the CID’srepresentation that its report is deniable because it is part of the generalPresidioinvestigation is indefensible. If the investigation were considered “closed”enough todismiss the charges against Adams-Thompson, then it is “closed” enough for theFreedom of Information Act to require immediate and thorough disclosure of theCID“investigation” of those charges.217 Appendix #34.- 453 -In the face of the CID’s concealment of that report, if it exists, I necessarilyconcludethat it is being denied me simply because my review of it would expose itsthoroughinadequacy, commencing with the CID’s failure to even contact the twoindividuals -myself and Mrs. Aquino - who had provided sworn statements in support of it. Ifthis isthe case, then the conduct of that “investigation” constitutes a furtherviolation ofArticle 134 UCMJ concerning misprision of serious offense and obstruction ofjustice.I once more restate and renew my request of 6/23/88 that a complete copy of thatreport of investigation in support of the court-martial charges I preferredagainstAdams-Thompson be provided to be without further excuse or delay.With reference to that same preferral of charges against Adams-Thompson, the CIDlater added to the titling against me the charge that I had sworn to falsestatements.Since the CID knew then and knows now that my sworn statements were true andverifiable in all respects, this addition to the titling sheet cannot beconstrued as otherthan an attempt to cover up the previous illegal acts of the CID suppressing thechargesagainst Adams-Thompson. This deliberate misrepresentation of my sworn statementsas false constitutes an additional violation of Article 134 concerningobstruction ofjustice, and also concerning communicating a threat (MCM IV para 110), to theextentthat this additional titling was intended to intimidate me because I had daredto seekjustice by invoking the UCMJ against a chaplain who had committed a seriouscrimeagainst Mrs. Aquino and myself.As Colonel Ray’s commander, and as Commanding General of the CIDC, you areresponsible to identify violations of the UCMJ and take corrective actionaccordingly.You are also responsible to identify violations of professional ethics by CIDpersonnel. Irequest that you do so with regard to the violations identified above,commencing withthe immediate rescinding of the titling against me and the identification andremoval ofany and all false and fraudulent statements in the investigation report whichpurport tosubstantiate it. The present situation is a flagrant and extraordinary outrageof justice,which is all the more shocking because of the complicity of the CID inperpetrating it.In connection with your disposition of the CID report concerning me, I once morerequest that you provide me with a copy of it prior to your decision, so that Imaycritique and annotate its statements and return it to you.If you take no action to correct these violations of the UCMJ by CID personnel,thenI will initiate a request to the Department of Defense Inspector General toreview thisentire affair, with additional attention to such memoranda, decisions, andactions atHeadquarters, Department of the Army level as may have acted to orchestrate andprejudice the CID actions taken against me in violation of the First andFourteenthAmendments to the Constitution and other applicable federal laws. I think thatSenator- 454 -Helms’ 1/9/89 letter to Secretary Marsh (copy enclosed) is a most illuminatingcase inpoint.As you know, I have to date avoided all comment to the public, press, orgovernmentoutside of the Department of the Army concerning the CID’s handling of thisinvestigation. As unjustified as I felt the investigation to be, I acceptedMajor Harvey’sword that it was an unbiased procedure designed to clear the air of anunresolved issue,which would result not only in my exoneration but in titling of Chaplain Adams-Thompson as the facts warranted. Obviously I was deceived.In order to avoid public embarrassment of the Army, and to give you maximumflexibility in correcting the injustice done to me, I will not initiate commentoutside ofofficial channels. If the press should learn of Colonel Ray’s titling decisionand/or thecontents of the report through any other source, however, and if they questionmeabout it, I will not hesitate to respond with the truth, to include all relevantdocumentation and correspondence between myself and the CID.Under no circumstances will I tolerate for a moment the further defamation of mywife, myself, or our church simply because the Army is trying to cover up thedisgraceful misconduct of a Christian chaplain. It is outrageous that we havebeensubjected to two years of this ordeal already, with an attendant stream ofvandalism,slander, death threats and malicious abuse from, the more ignorant and fanaticelements of the public. The safety and security of other members of our churchandtheir families, both military and civilian, have been endangered as well.The Army could have ended this ordeal at any time with a clear and unequivocalstatement of the truth. Not only has it not had the courage to do so; it has, toits shame,acted to aggravate this injustice to an honorable and innocent Army family. Thisinjustice will be corrected as the truth inevitably comes to light. The onlyquestion ishow far the United States Army is willing to sanction misprision and obstructionofjustice simply in order to cover up the criminal misconduct of Chaplain Adams-Thompson.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

AQUINO and HAMBRIGHT, acting in concert,transported K. ADAMS-THOMPSON, without parental permission, from the CDC, PSF,CA, to 123 Acme Ave, SF, CA, the residence of LTC and L. AQUINO, where LTCAQUINO was waiting. There, with the assistance of LTC and L. AQUINO,HAMBRIGHT forced K. ADAMS-THOMPSON to orally copulate him and indecentlyassaulted her.On an undetermined date HAMBRIGHT transported E. DORSEY, without parentalpermission, to 208 Delores St, SF, CA. At that location he removed her clothingandfondled her vaginal area with his hand.- 458 -On 4 Jan 88, at Headquarters, ARPERCEN, 9700 Page Blvd, St Louis, MO 63132, LTCAQUINO filed charges against CPT ADAMS-THOMPSON for a violation of Art 133,UCMJ wherein LTC AQUINO alleged that CPT ADAMS-THOMPSON falsely accusedhim of sexually assaulting K. ADAMS-THOMPSON, charges he knew to be false sinceLTC AQUINO had in his possession a police report clearly indicating theaccusationswere made by K. ADAMS-THOMPSON, not her father.On 4 Jan 88, 23 Aug 88, and 27 Jan 89, at Headquarters, ARPERCEN, 9700 PageBlvd,St Louis, MO 63132, LTC AQUINO rendered false written sworn statements byknowingly mis-stating the age of K. ADAMS-THOMPSON (while having a document inhis possession which correctly stated her date of birth), and by denying havingeverbeen to the CDC, PSF, CA. On 4 Jan 88 and 10-11 May 89, L. AQUINO, in swornstatements, falsely denied her participation in the cited offenses.During a sworn interview conducted 10-11 May 1989, LTC AQUINO admitted toofficiating at the West Black Mass, in 1970, while on active duty as acommissionedofficer. By organizing and orchestrating a Black Mass ceremony involving publicnudity; female public urination in the presence of males; placing a cracker intothevagina of a naked female serving as a “living alter”; LTC [sic] committed theoffense ofConduct Unbecoming an officer and Indecent Acts.During the course of this investigation Wesley K. WITHROW, Civ, 570-63-6261, andBrandon C. WITHROW,557-71-3241, both residing at 642 Henderson Lane,Ukiah, CA, alleged LTC AQUINO, along with other adults, including their maternalgrandparents, fondled their privates, placed their (the adult’s) fingers intheir, W. andB. WITHROW’s, respective anuses and forced them to lie nude, on top of nudewomenand simulate intercourse. Additionally, both indicated they had observed LTCAQUINO, and others, engage in the ritualistic murder of numerous adults andchildrenin San Francisco, CA, Sonoma County, CA, and Mendocino County, CA. Investigationdid not substantiate the incidents occurred as alleged; therefore, based oncoordinationwith the supported Staff Judge Advocate, W. WITHROW and B. WITHROW werepreviously deleted as victims in this report.STATUTES:18 USC, Section 1201 - Kidnapping.Art 134, UCMJ - Kidnapping.18 USC, Section 373 - Conspiracy.Art 81, UCMJ - Conspiracy.Art 77, UCMJ - Principal.18 USC, Section 2242 (B) - Sexual Abuse.Art 125, UCMJ - SodomyArt 98, UCMJ -Noncompliance with Procedural Rules.- 459 -Art 134 (87) UCMJ - Indecent Liberties with a ChildArt 134 (90) UCMJ - Indecent Acts with AnotherArt 134 (79) UCMJ - False SwearingArt 133 UCMJ - Conduct Unbecoming an OfficerBASIS FOR INVESTIGATION:In November 1986, the San Francisco Field Office, USACIDC, initiated Report ofInvestigation (ROI) 0667-86-C1D026-69776, regarding the sexual assault/abuse ofchildren attending the CDC, PSF, CA, by Mr Gary Hambright, a UA-05 careprovider,employed at the CDC. During the investigation by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation(FBI), USACIDC, and the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), informationsurfaced that some of the victims had been taken to off-post dwellings, wherethey hadbeen ritualistically abused. The victims provided fragmented informationconcerningthe location and perpetrators of the sexual abuse. The name “Mike” or “Mikey”wasmentioned during therapy sessions at Child Psychiatry, Letterman Army MedicalCenter (L.AMC). On 12 Aug 1987, Kinsey Adams-Thompson (hereinafter Kinsey),whilein the Presidio Post Exchange with her parents, observed LTC AQUINO, anddisplayingfright, informed her mother, “That’s the bad man, that’s Mikey.” The SFPD wasthelead on this investigation, which USACIDC monitored and assisted (Sequence#0499-87-C1D026). In Sep 1988, SFPD terminated active investigation, asinvestigation to date had not generated sufficient evidence to convince civilauthoritiesthat prosecution had a high probability of conviction. On 21 Nov 1988, based onabriefing by the SFPD, consideration of medical evidence, FBI records; andcoordinationbetween USACIDC personnel and supported Staff Judge Advocate’s Office, adetermination was made that sufficient evidence existed to initiate this ROl.On September 30, 1987, a 12 count indictment was returned by a grand jurylocated inSan Francisco that alleged that Mr. Gary HAMBRIGHT sexually assaulted DavidTOBIN, Lee BALLWAY, Ryan BALLWAY, Kara BAILEY, Leticia COLE, TrinityHANRICK, Catherine HUYCKE, Larry STOUDEMIRE, Christopher FIELDS, and CohnFOX at the Presidio CDC.

Colonel Michael A. Aquino[A copy of this analysis was provided to the Commanding General, CICon November 30, 1989. Neither acknowledgment nor response was received.]* * *1.Date.a. This cover letter (Attachment #A) is dated 11 August 1989.b. On 5/31/89, concerned because of remarks he had heard from Major Harvey(SJA 6RCID) about the report, my Army attorney Captain Hayes requested thatwe be allowed to review and provide comments concerning it to Colonel WebsterRay, 6RCID commander, prior to his making any decision concerning it.[Attachment #B].c.On 6/12/89 the 6RCID denied this request. [Attachment #C].d. On 6/20/89 Harvey told Hayes that he fully expected Colonel Ray to title meforthe Adams-Thompson allegations. Accordingly, realizing that I was simply thetarget of a pre-determined frame-up, I sent Colonel Ray the letter at Attachment#D.e. On 7/4/89 Hayes obtained from Harvey a copy of the draft of this coverletter.Accordingly I faxed the 6RCID, with a copy to Major General Cromartie, thedetailed refutation of the draft at Attachment #E.f.On 7/6/89 Ray sent me a non-committal answer (Attachment #F), then informedHayes on 7/31/89 that he would be titling me anyway.g. On 8/3/89 I sent Major General Cromartie the letter at Attachment #G,notifyinghim of the violation of Articles #133 & #134 UCMJ by Colonel Ray in his signingof the fraudulent titling. I also restated my request for an immediate copy ofthereport by which this titling was supposedly substantiated.- 461 -h. On 8/11/89-8/28/89 the CID made distribution of this report, including itsfraudulent titling action, to [at minimum] the Crime Records Center,Commanding General of Fort Leonard Wood, Commander of ARPERCEN,Commander of the Presidio of San Francisco, and Sergeant/Inspector Pamfiloffof the San Francisco Police Department (Attachment #H).(1)Neither I nor my attorneys were informed of this action, nor were weprovided with a copy of the report.(2)The distribution of this report to Pamfiloff is especially improper because, asthe CID well knows, this officer was formally investigated by the SanFrancisco Police Commission for his bias and flagrant misconduct of theoriginal SFPD action in this case, allegations which the Commission finallysustained [Attachment #I]. While it is inappropriate for a fraudulent reportsuch as this to be sent to the San Francisco Police in the first place, any suchmaterial should, under these circumstances, have been sent directly to theInvestigating Officer of the Police Commission, Ms. Irene Rapoza.i.On 11/20/89 I first learned that the fraudulent report had been distributed. Mycivilian attorney, Mr. Gary Myers, immediately telephoned Cromartie’sheadquarters and demanded a copy of the report without further delay. He waspromised that a copy would be sent to me immediately.j.I finally received a heavily censored and blanked-out copy of the report on11/27/89 - six months after my initial request for it, and three and one-halfmonths after it had been distributed by the CID.k. Quite obviously it was the intention of the CID first to avoid receivinginformation that would specifically invalidate the statements of the reportbeforethe fraudulent titling action could be taken; then to distribute the defamatoryreport throughout my chain of command - and to Pamfiloff - to cause as muchharm to myself, Mrs. Aquino, and our religion as possible; and finally to delayproviding a copy of the report to me as long as possible, knowing that it wouldimmediately be exposed for the transparent fraud that it is.l.On 11/21/89, through the FOIA, I requested from the CID commanding general,Major General Cromartie, a copy of all regulations and directives which governthe distribution of CID investigative reports, both to the subject of the reportandto other addressees [Attachment #J]. As of this date I have not yet received aresponse. Major General Cromartie is thereby in violation of the Freedom ofInformation Act.- 462 -2. Location of occurrence.The report contains no substantiation that either Mrs. Aquino or I ever visitedthePresidio day-care center, 208 Dolores Street (apparently the residence of GaryHambright) or were involved in any way with alleged criminal activitiesconnectedwith these or any other locations. The report contains no substantiation thatanycrime ever took place at 123 Acme Avenue (our home). The authors and approverswere and are fully aware of this. This entry thus constitutes deliberateobstruction ofjustice by the authors in violation of Article 134 UCMJ and the making of afalseofficial statement in violation of Article 133 UCMJ.3. Date/time of occurrence.a. When Chaplain Adams-Thompson made his initial allegations against us inAugust 1987, he specifically indicated the time period “September-October1986” (San Francisco Police Department incident report 8/14/87). When the CIDverified that neither Mrs. Aquino nor I had been in San Francisco at any timeduring this period when Kinsey Almond had been at the day-care center, thisproved our innocence and provided further evidence of Adams-Thompson’sdeliberate malice in making his accusations.b. Instead, in an effort to cover up the Chaplain’s crime and to fabricate a“case”against us, the authors arbitrarily back-dated the date/time to a periodwhen Mrs. Aquino and I were still assigned to the Presidio. This constitutes anact of deliberate misprision of serious offense, falsification of evidence, andobstruction of justice by the authors in violation of Article 134 UCMJ and themaking of a false official statement in violation of Article 133 UCMJ.c.Furthermore, on FBI Form #FD-302 (1/14/87) (attachment #K), it is clearlyestablished that Almond was not assigned to Gary Hambright’s class atthe day-care center until September 1986. He had no control overAlmond during the May-July 86 time-frame, hence could not possiblyhave abducted her at that time. The authors possessed this document butconcealed its existence from me and omitted mention of its significance in thisreport. They further concealed the existence and contents of this document fromthe 25th Infantry Division Investigating Officer inquiring into the originalcourt-martial charges against Adams-Thompson. These acts constitute the deliberateconcealment of evidence by the authors, hence misprision of serious offense andobstruction of justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.d. In a 12/15/86 letter to Presidio parents (attachment #L), Lt. Colonel Myer,Director of Personnel & Community Affairs of the Presidio of San Francisco,further stated that Gary Hambright had no supervision over any children under- 463 -the age of 3, which Almond did not attain until September 1, 1986.Again this makes impossible the commission of any such crime as theCID report alleges in the May-July 86 time-period. Again the authorsknew about this document but concealed its existence from me and omittedmention of its significance in this report. This constitutes the deliberateconcealment of evidence by the authors in an act of misprision of seriousoffenseand obstruction of justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.4. Date/time reported.a. According to the SFPD incident report, FBI Agent Clyde Foreman informed SFPDSergeant/Inspector Pamfiloff that Lawrence and Michele Adams-Thompsonmade their “package story” allegations to him on 8/13/87. All that they allegedtoForeman by telephone on 8/12/87 (FBI FD-302 L. Adams-Thompson, 8/13/87)was the 8/12/87 PX encounter.]b. The official FBI record of the Adams-Thompsons’ allegations of kidnapping andchild-abuse (FBI Form FD-302, 8/13/87) further verifies that this “packagestory” was not presented for the first time until 8/13/87.(1)This is one day after the Adams-Thompsons saw us in the Presidio PX.Why did it take the Adams-Thompsons a day to report what they representedas a serious crime?(2)Why was there no mention whatever of this “package story” toanyone prior to this date, whether or not the Adams-Thompsonsfelt it timely to “identify” a target “Mikey/Shamby”? The evidencequite obviously indicates that the Adams-Thompsons made their decision tomanufacture a story to use Kinsey Almond for their personal profit in thePresidio child-care scam subsequent to the 1/14/87 FBI interview. Incollaboration with Debbie Hickey, who supplied the “Satanic” propagandaand a rag-bag of fantasies for Adams-Thompson to pick and choose from intrying to create a plausible “package story”, it is evident from the Hickeynotes that by June 87 the Adams-Thompsons had already decided to try toattack me. Their unexpected sight of Mrs. Aquino and myself in the PX on8/12/87 simply gave them an opportunity to falsify that encounter as welland then present the hastily-thrown-together “package story” the next day.That it was a last-minute rush-job is also evidenced by the fact that Micheleoffered it in one version to the FBI on 8/13/87 and Lawrence offered it in adifferent and inconsistent version to the SFPD a day later on 8/14/87.c.Lawrence and Michele’s allegations on 8/13/87 and 8/14/87 made no mention ofthe locations of the CDC or 208 Delores Street, and specified the time period of- 464 -September-October 1986. Therefore not only is the “date/time reported” entry inthis cover letter wrong, but its connection to the “location of occurrence” and“date/time of occurrence” is false.d. The authors of the report are aware of the significance of a day’s delay inthemaking of the allegations by the Adams-Thompsons, and they possess thedocuments verifying this. They are aware of all the evidence verifying the bogusmanufacture of the “package story” by the Adams-Thompsons. They know that onthe dates when the Adams-Thompsons first made their allegations to the FBI andSFPD, those allegations specifically contradict other entries on this coverletter.This cover-letter entry thus constitutes falsification of evidence by theauthors inviolation of Article 134 UCMJ and a false official statement in violation ofArticle133 UCMJ.5. Investigated by.a. The names of only Sergeant Stephen Penaluna and Chief Warrant Officer DanielCates are cited here.(1)In actuality the principal role as investigator was played by Captain/MajorMark Harvey, the Staff Judge Advocate of 6RCID, who to my knowledge isneither trained nor qualified as a CID investigator. He is an attorney whoseproper purpose is to advise the 6RCID commander on legal matters and toreview the findings of authorized CID investigators for compliance with thelaw. During the entire course of this investigation, my attorneys and I had farmore investigative question/answer contact with Harvey than with eitherCates or Penaluna.(2)Penaluna, in fact, was originally the sole investigator assigned to theinvestigation in November 1988 (according to his own statement to me atthat time). I was later told that Cates was brought down from Alaska, fourmonths after the investigation was started, to take over the investigationbecause Penaluna was not considered sufficiently competent to conduct it onhis own. This was told bluntly to my attorney Captain Hayes in informalconversation and was couched in more diplomatic language in Harvey’sofficial letter. [See attachment #M, paragraph 5.](3)I was informed by Hayes that Cates returned to Alaska approximately twomonths before Colonel Ray reviewed the report. During this period it wasHarvey who, judging by his repeated statements to Hayes, was in charge ofits extensive re-writing and editing. Therefore the actual author of thefinal report is evidently Harvey, with Cates merely signing it pro forma.I think that, if the matter is researched, it will be found that Penaluna wrote- 465 -little if any of it, and that he did not have the final say as to any of itscontentsor conclusions regardless of the placement of his name first among theauthors.b. The evident actual author of this report is thus a junior Army attorneywithouteither CID investigative training or credentials, nor any background in fake“child-abuse” scams such as that at the Presidio. He was assisted by one CIDagent who was considered incompetent to handle the investigation by himself,and a second CID agent who was brought into the investigation when it wasapparently determined that Penaluna was not taking it towards thepredetermined conclusion, and who left approximately two months before thereport bearing his name was revised, edited, final-typed, and reviewed by the6RCID commander. Nor is there any information known to me that either Catesor Penaluna have any special training in the handling of “mass Satanic day-carechild-abuse” scams such as have become a major fad in the country since the LosAngeles McMartin fiasco.c.As the narrative report is extremely [and illegally] prejudicial and defamatorytothe Satanic religion of its targets (Mrs. Aquino and myself), the religiousconvictions of the authors are directly relevant and material. All were formallyraised and trained as Christians in three of the most extreme and anti-Satanicchurches of that religion.(1)Penaluna is a Lutheran. The Lutheran Church, since its founding, has beenthe most intolerant of Protestant churches and was responsible for massslaughters of accused Satanists in medieval Europe. In 1988 the LutheranChurch in the United States published a vicious propaganda document Howto Respond to Satanism attacking the Satanic religion, accusing it ofsponsoring ritual child-abuse, cannibalism, murder, and similar atrocities.Satanism is described as the mortal enemy of Christianity, to be attacked anderadicated in society at all costs.(2)Cates is a Baptist. The Baptist churches, as the mainstream of modern“religious-right” fundamentalism, have been consistently in the forefront ofthe current nationwide campaign to slander and persecute the Satanicreligion.(3)Harvey, principal author of the CID report, is a Catholic. The CatholicChurch is responsible for the torture and slaughter of millions of accusedSatanists throughout history. In contemporary America it has a massiverecord of convictions of sex-crimes against children and official efforts tocover up such crimes [see Attachment #N]. Its official spokesmen during thecurrent nationwide campaign to persecute the Satanic religion have- 466 -published gutter propaganda of the crudest sort. The Catholic Church alsoemploys a disgusting and offensive ritual, entitled the Rite of Exorcism, tofurther slander our religion and our deity. It was in response to the Rite ofExorcism that the Satanic Missa Solemnis was historically created. Thisexplains Harvey’s obsession with that religious ceremony - despite the factthat it has nothing whatever to do with the Adams-Thompson allegations -and his transparent effort to misuse the titling power of the CID to suppressit, threaten us, and consequently intimidate other Satanists in the armedforces from daring to celebrate any religious ceremony unacceptable to hisCatholic value system.(4)All three authors have insisted that their religions did not affect theobjectivity of this investigation. This is contradicted by the structure andcontent of the report itself.(a)The major portion of the investigation report is quite obviously anattempt to distort, attack, and defame the Satanic religion, and to attackand defame Mrs. Aquino and myself for being adherents of it. Extensivenarrative passages by Harvey [as boasted by him to Hayes duringconversations between them at the Presidio Officers Club and elsewhereduring his final writing of the report] are devoted to clumsy argumentswhy our religion should be denied the protection of the Constitutionconcerning its beliefs, practices, and ceremonies. The “logic” of thesearguments recalls the similar “logic” used by the Nazis to justify theirsuppression, persecution, and extermination of the Jewish religion.(b)In contrast, comparatively little space is devoted to the Adams-Thompson allegations per se, because of course there is no evidence tosubstantiate them and the authors declined to discuss the massiveevidence exonerating us and proving the crimes of Lawrence andMichele Adams-Thompson. Such “evidence” as is presented boils downto the same thing again and again: completely unsupportedstatements by interested adults and/or “therapized” children long afterthe details of the Adams-Thompson attack had become commonknowledge to anyone remotely interested in the Presidio scam, similarday-care scams around the country, or the anti-Satanism campaign stillin vogue among the religious extremists of the country.(c)A genuine religion dictates the moral principles of its adherents. If Cates,Penaluna, and Harvey insist that they have set the intense anti-Satanicbias of their religions aside in conducting this investigation, they aresaying that their religions, and consequently the morals prescribed bythem, may be selectively ignored when inconvenient. Hence none of- 467 -these authors may be relied upon to state the truth when it isinconvenient - as of course it was in this fraudulent CID report.(d)On the other hand, if Cates, Harvey, and Penaluna say that they did notcompromise the dictates of their faiths in conducting this investigation,then the official position of all three of those faiths dictates that theSatanic religion and its representatives should be condemned a priori.“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” And of course ChristianChaplain Adams-Thompson and his Christian wife are at all costs to beprotected from accountability for their crimes, which, since they were“against Satan and Satanism” are not only excusable but indeedcommendable!d. It is not necessary that a CID investigation such as this be conducted by“religiousfriends” rather than “religious enemies” of Satanism. The important thing isthatthe religious neutrality of all investigators be beyond question. In this casenone of the three investigators was either a Satanist, an atheist, an agnostic,or amember of any religion other than Christianity - the religion with a 2,000-yearold record of the most extreme hatred and persecution of Satanism.e. The truthfulness of Major Harvey, as the principal author of this report,bearsadditional scrutiny.(1) Harvey has in fact lied to me and my attorneys on several occasions. Forinstance, Harvey’s 4/7/87 letter to Hayes (Attachment #O) containsnumerous half-truths, deceptive statements, and outright lies. These aredetailed in my 4/24/89 response to him (Attachment #P). [It was not untilmuch later that I learned, via FOIA papers from the Department of the Army,just how flagrant Harvey’s lies in his 4/7/87 letter were. [See Attachment#Q.](2)More recently, Harvey reiterated the lie to my Army attorney Captain Tintion 9/29/89 that this investigation was not started consequent to post-Geraldo political pressure, and said that he “thought” I was fingerprinted bythe CID prior to the 10/25/88 airing of that show. Harvey knew quite wellthat the CID investigation of me was not opened until almost a month afterthat show, and that of course I was not ordered to be fingerprinted by theCID until that time.(3)Harvey has repeatedly tried to find some way of reinterpreting inconvenientrevelations of the investigation into something completely the opposite. Inblunt terms, such efforts constitute an attempt to manufacture evidence inviolation of Article 134 UCMJ.- 468 -(a)When he found that I had purchased a black panther statue in St. Louislong after the time when he could have tried to use it as “evidence”against me, he asked the artist who made the statue whether it waspossible for me to have purchased an identical statue in San Franciscoyears previously.(b)Adams-Thompson’s “package story” to the SFPD included mention of alion-footed bathtub, over which Pamfiloff was so confused that in thesame report [on the same page] he wrote it up as both “a plastic lionbathtub” and “a bathtub with lion’s feet”. [In a supposed FBI FD-302interview with Foreman 8/13/87 (still concealed from me), Almondpurportedly said “bathtub with lion’s feet”, in which case either Adams-Thompson or Pamfiloff creatively and arbitrarily added “plastic lionbathtub” as an option the next morning.]When Pamfiloff’s midnight raid on our home failed to reveal either typeof bathtub, and when CID interviews with workmen who had spentconsiderable time in all areas of our building still yielded no plastic lionbathtubs or lion’s-footed bathtubs, Harvey went on a personal crusadefor anything remotely lion-like.Thwarted by the St. Louis-purchased panther statue, he proceeded topropose that a tiny figure in one corner of a painting hanging in ourliving room could qualify. That figure is a 2-3” frontal picture of a sphinxwith Anton LaVey’s head. Outside of the fact that there are two paws onthe front, it bears no features of a lion whatever. Nor can the painting beused as a bathtub. Nor can Pharaoh Tutankhamen’s golden throne beused as a bathtub. [If Harvey wishes to argue that Kinsey Almond cannotdistinguish between an oil painting on the wall, a chair, and a bathtub,any other statements by her scarcely commend themselves forcredibility.](c)Confronted with the inconvenient fact that Mrs. Aquino and I haveconsistently told the CID verified truths and that the Adams-Thompsons have just as consistently told the CID (and the SFPD and theFBI) a long string of verified lies, Harvey has tried doggedly to come upwith some excuse for calling me a liar. After an intensive search he cameup with the dazzling revelation (a) that I had been confused over KinseyAlmond’s age, and (b) that I hadn’t read a definition of my wife’s namethat he had managed to find. These “discoveries” are trumpeted atlength in the CID report as if they prove something relevant, which of- 469 -course they don’t. These idiotic assertions by Harvey are addressed inmy 10/18/89 letter to General Cromartie (Attachment #R).(d)Harvey’s defamatory distortion of the Satanic religion in the CID report,and his utter misrepresentation and quoting out-of-context of my wordsand actions therein, are examples of religious bigotry and propaganda atits most extreme. Harvey has no excuse for this display of prejudice, asin each case he knows from discussions with me and documentationprovided by me that the truth is not at all as he has tried tomisrepresent it in the report. In addition to Harvey’s hate-propagandaagainst our religion constituting a violation of Article 133 UCMJ, it isquite clear that this officer stands in conspicuous and intentionalviolation of AR 600-20’s requirement that all soldiers and their familiesbe free to practice their religions as guaranteed by the Constitution.6. Title.a. Concerning myself, none of these crimes are proven or even substantiated intheleast by this report. The report further omits massive amounts of informationwhich refute absolutely the allegations. This titling is thus a deliberatelyfalse official statement by the authors, and Colonel Ray as signatory, inviolation of Article 133 UCMJ. If each “title” is considered as a separate falsestatement, then the authors and Colonel Ray are guilty of eight violations ofArticle 133 in this titling statement alone.b. The second paragraph identifies Gary Hambright. This report establishes noconnection whatever between Hambright [or anyone else at the child-carecenter] and either Mrs. Aquino or myself. Hence the introduction of Hambright’sname, and of separate allegations against him during the Presidio child-carehysteria, is a transparent effort by the authors and Colonel Ray to imply aconnection between Hambright/those allegations and Adams-Thompson’sseparate attack upon Mrs. Aquino and myself. Such an effort to color this ROIwith “guilt by implication” constitutes a violation of Article 133 UCMJ (falseofficial statement) and Article 134 (obstruction of justice).It is further significant that Hambright is not a proven or convicted criminalinthe Presidio child-care scam. Although he was investigated for allegations madeagainst him in that witch-hunt, all of the allegations were either thrownout by the court or withdrawn by the prosecution. Therefore Hambrightis entitled by law to the presumption of innocence, and the authors’obvious attempts to find some way of connecting his life with ours on theassumption that this would “prove” something about us are properly exposed asmere propaganda trying to exploit the publicity accorded the Hambright- 470 -accusations in the media. Such sleazy methods are not proper to an investigatoryreport such as this.c.Mrs. Lilith Aquino.(1) The titling of Mrs. Aquino, a civilian not subject to the UCMJ, by the CIDis aviolation of U.S. law.(2)Concerning Mrs. Aquino, none of these crimes are proven or evensubstantiated in the least by this report. The report further omits massiveamounts of information which refute absolutely the allegations. Thistitling is thus a deliberately false official statement by the authors, andColonel Ray as signatory, in violation of Article 133 UCMJ. If each “title” isconsidered as a separate false statement, then the authors and Colonel Rayare guilty of eight violations of Article 133 in this titling statement alone.(3)Mrs. Aquino and I take strong exception to the phrase “AKA Patricia Wise,Patricia Sinclair, Lilith Sinclair”, which implies that these are “phony”aliasesshe uses. “Patricia Wise” was her maiden name, which [as the CID knows]she legally changed to “Lilith Sinclair” as an adult. She has never used thename “Patricia Sinclair”. Upon her marriage to me in January 1986, she tookmy last name as is customary under the circumstances. “Lilith Aquino” is theonly name she has used since then.(4)If it is CID practice to refer to all persons in a report by any names they haveever used, may I suggest:• Lawrence Adams-Thompson, AKA Larry Thompson, Larry Adams-Thompson, Larry Parker Adams-Thompson.•Michele Adams-Thompson, AKA Michele Adams, Michele Elise.•Kinsey Almond, AKA Kinsey Adams, AKA Kinsey Adams-Thompson.7. Victim.a. “Kinsey Almond”. The report not only does not substantiate that either Mrs.Aquino or I committed any crimes concerning this child [or any other child] inany way; it also does not substantiate that anyone committed any such crimesconcerning that child. On 5/14/89 the CID obtained a copy of a medicalexamination of Almond performed on 3/12/87, stating that there was “nophysical evidence of abuse”. This contradicts absolutely the statement ofpsychiatrist Debbie Hickey that Almond was abused - which, upon examination,is clearly based not upon explicit testimony from Almond to Hickey, but ratherupon nothing more than Hickey’s personal whim as to what Almond’s childish- 471 -fantasies “mean”. Identifying of Almond as a “victim” is thus a deliberatelyfalse official statement by the authors, and Colonel Ray as signatory, inviolation of Article 133 UCMJ.b. “Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson”. The report not only does notsubstantiate that either Mrs. Aquino or I committed any crimes concerning thisindividual in any way; it deliberately distorts my efforts to see him brought tojustice under the UCMJ for the crime he committed against Mrs. Aquino andmyself, and for his efforts to defraud the U.S. Government of several millionsofdollars in fraudulent claims. This is thus a deliberately false officialstatement by the authors, and Colonel Ray as signatory, in violation of Article133 UCMJ. It is further an act of misprision of serious offense and obstructionofjustice by the 6RCID in violation of Article 134 UCMJ in that the 6RCID hasdeliberately concealed evidence of Adams-Thompson’s crimes from the 25thInfantry Division (his UCMJ authority).c.“U.S. Government”: The authors and Colonel Ray as signatory are all aware thatnothing in this report substantiates “conspiracy, false sworn statement, falsestatement, indecent acts, and conduct unbecoming an officer”. This is thus adeliberately false official statement by the authors, and Colonel Ray assignatory, in violation of Article 133 UCMJ. It is further an act of misprisionofserious offense and obstruction of justice by the 6RCID in violation of Article134UCMJ in that the authors have deliberately concealed the evidence of Adams-Thompson’s crime which validates all of my statements, sworn and unsworn,concerning it.d. Emily Dorsey. As with the insertion of Hambright’s name into the titlingblock ofthis ROI, the insertion of Dorsey’s name here is merely to associate allegationsofkidnapping and sexual abuse (actually against only Hambright) with Mrs.Aquino and myself as the targets of this fraudulent ROI. Such an effort to colorthis ROI with “guilt by implication” constitutes a violation of Article 133 UCMJ(false official statement) and Article 134 (obstruction of justice).8. Synopsis.a. Paragraph #1.(1)This investigation did not “disclose” that Lilith Aquino and/or GaryHambright transported Kinsey Almond (name deleted but presumed fromreport), or any other child, anywhere. It did not “disclose” that I wasinvolved in any contact with Almond [or any other allegedly-molestedchildren] whatever. It did not “disclose” that Almond [or any otherallegedly-molested child] has ever been present inside our San Francisco- 472 -home. It did not “disclose” that Hambright has ever “forced Almond to orallycopulate him and that he indecently assaulted her”, with or withoutinvolvement by Mrs. Aquino and/or myself.(2)Throughout this investigation the CID has been provided with massiveamounts of information which expose every single one of these allegationsby Lawrence and Michele Adams-Thompson as a deliberate series ofcontinuously- and clumsily-altered lies. See Attachment #S, theoriginal draft of which was presented to the authors during our personalinterview with them in early May, well before the writing of this report.[Updated editions of this list have regularly been provided to the CID as well,as I have been able to obtain more information - including much which theCID attempted to conceal from me.]b. Paragraph #2: Mrs. Aquino and I have never had any contact whatever with GaryHambright [save to receive a 7/14/89 statement from him through the SanFrancisco Public Defender’s Office in which he certifies that he has never hadanycontact with us - Attachment #T]. However, this paragraph is not substantiatedby any evidence known to me, nor was Hambright ever prosecuted based uponthese allegations.As with the insertion of Hambright’s name into the titling block of this ROI,andDorsey’s name into the “victim” heading, the inclusion of this paragraph in thisROI is merely to associate allegations of kidnapping and sexual abuse (actuallyagainst only Hambright) with Mrs. Aquino and myself as the targets of thisfraudulent ROI. Such an effort to color this ROI with “guilt by implication”constitutes a violation of Article 133 UCMJ (false official statement) andArticle134 (obstruction of justice).c.Paragraph #3.(1) The 1/4/88 charges that I filed against Chaplain Adams-Thompson werebased upon the information contained in my sworn statement of that date,which was and remains true as sworn. Not a single item in that swornstatement, or in my updated 8/23/88 one, has been impeached or disprovedby the CID or anyone else. The authors know of the evidence supportingSpecification #1 of the charges that I preferred against Adams-Thompson,and, in violation of Article 134 UCMJ, deliberately concealed additionalevidence supporting it, unknown to me at the time, from theCommanding Generals of the 25th Division and WESTCOM. This istherefore a deliberately false official statement by the authors, andColonel Ray as signatory, in violation of Article 133 UCMJ.- 473 -(2)The San Francisco Police Report of August 14, 1987 clearly identifies “LarryP. Adams-Thompson” as the “primary reportee” of the allegations. Hisstatements are identified as “(R/P1)” throughout the narrative of thereport. 218 Michele Adams-Thompson is identified as “(P2)” in the narrative.Kinsey Almond is identified as “(V)”. Pages #2-3 of the report contain thenarrative.(a)On page #2 all of the statements to the SFPD were made either byLawrence or Michele Adams-Thompson. “(V)” appears only whereeither Lawrence or Michele, in their statements to Foreman or Pamfiloff,were referring to her or purporting to repeat statements from her ordescribe actions by her.(b)On page #3 there are still no direct statements by Almond to Pamfiloff.Rather Pamfiloff is writing down what he was told were Almond’sstatements to FBI Agent Foreman on the previous day. As this was allrelated to Pamfiloff second-hand, and as Lawrence Adams-Thompson isidentified on page #1 of the SFPD report as the “primary reportee”, it isclear that he made these statements to Pamfiloff.(c)Other than the fact that Almond was present when Pamfiloff’s discussionwith Lawrence Adams-Thompson took place - as stated on page #2, lines#4-5 of the SFPD report, there is no indication that Almond saidanything whatever to Pamfiloff.(d)The authors’ statement concerning this point is thus a deliberatelyfalse official statement by them, and Colonel Ray as signatory, inviolation of Article 133 UCMJ.d. Paragraph #4.(1) As stated in my 10/18/89 letter to Major General Cromartie (Attachment#U), my inattention to Kinsey Almond’s age is a quite understandable andhonest mistake, which is not in the least material to the investigation.Considering that I now have a massive accumulation of letters, personaldocuments, and statements which I have provided to the SFPD and the CIDsince they decided to mount this shameful campaign against us, Harvey’sfocus on this as the only incorrect statement he has found is absurd.218 As personally confirmed to me by Glenn Pamfiloff in 1991, Kinsey Almond wasnot even presentduring his 8/14/87 interview with Larry A-T. See Chapter #4.- 474 -(2)I have in fact never been to the Presidio child-care center, nor has Mrs.Aquino. Since the report contains no evidence to substantiate that we have,this allegation is as false as all the rest.(3)The claim of the paragraph that either Mrs. Aquino or myself has ever told adeliberate lie to the CID, or in any way concealed the truth with regard to thisaffair, is thus a false statement by the authors in violation of Article 133UCMJ. By trying to misrepresent our sworn statements as false, furthermore,the authors and Colonel Ray as signatory further commit an act of misprisionof serious offense and obstruction of justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.e. Paragraph #5.(1)As has been common knowledge within the Church of Satan and Temple ofSet for 19 years, I indeed officiated at a Black Mass ( Missa Solemnis) at theCentral Grotto of the Church of Satan in 1970. I take exception to the word“admitted” in this paragraph, implying as it does that the CID “caught me atsomething”. The Missa Solemnis was and is an official religious ceremony ofthe Church of Satan and Temple of Set, and the 1970 Mass was described indetail in my history The Church of Satan, published in 1983. The MissaSolemnis contains no illegal elements whatever. As such it isprotected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and has nobusiness even being mentioned in this CID report, much less represented as“conduct unbecoming an officer” or “indecent acts”.(2)The authors allege that I officiated at the “West” Black Mass. The text of thatceremony (authored by Priest Wayne West), which I provided to the authorsin St. Louis in May 1989 (as an appendix to The Church of Satan), wasindeed the basis for the Missa Solemnis which I performed at the Church ofSatan in 1970. As I informed Harvey, Cates, and Penaluna, however, Imodified the ceremony as actually performed in several ways to deleteelements which I personally considered unnecessary and/or inappropriate.Thus the ceremony as performed contained no disrobing, no masturbation,no consumption of bodily fluids of any sort, and no nudity (save for theLiving Altar).(3)The Missa Solemnis does not involve “public nudity”. It is a privatereligious ceremony which was conducted exclusively for registeredmembers of the Church of Satan. The 1970 ceremony was conducted withinthe home of Anton LaVey and was by invitation only to selected members ofthe Central Grotto of the Church of Satan.- 475 -(4)No “female public urination in the presence of males” took place during theMissa Solemnis. It was a closed, private ceremony. Furthermore the act ofurination by the female involved had a specific religious significance and wasnot in the least for obscene or prurient purposes.(5)Similarly the placing of a cracker into the vagina of the Living Altar had aspecific and precisely-defined religious significance and was not in the leastfor obscene or prurient purposes. The cracker, as symbolic of Jesus Christ,was intended to symbolize the experience of physical love with a woman. If aSatanic religious ceremony involving the female vagina is affirmed to be“criminal” by the CID, then Judæo/Christian rituals of penis mutilation(circumcision) must also be held to be “criminal” - and acts of child abuse.(6)On 5/10-11/89 during our interview with the authors, it became increasinglyclear that Major Harvey was particularly obsessed with the subject of theMissa Solemnis, coming back to it again and again. Accordingly I tookconsiderable time to discuss its history and purpose with him. Weeks later,upon hearing from my military attorney Captain Hayes that Harvey was stillobsessed with the Missa Solemnis, I once more took the time to carefullyreview its religious significance to him (Attachment #V). Harvey and theother authors thus have no excuse whatever for misunderstanding theauthentic religious purpose of the ceremony.(7)For the authors to try to represent the private, legal, religious ceremonies ofany legitimate church as crimes under the UCMJ is a flagrant andinexcusable violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution and ofArmy Regulation 600-20 in support of it. To the extent that such arepresentation by the authors is intended to constitute a threat that Satanistsin the Armed Forces may not practice their religion freely and withoutintimidation or persecution, the authors have acted to communicate a threatin violation of Article 134 UCMJ ( MCM IV, paragraph 110).(8)Incidentally, although ceremonial nudity is not used by the Temple of Setand was only occasionally used by the Church of Satan, there are a greatmany non-Christian religions, with hundreds if not thousands of members inthe armed forces, which worship entirely in the nude (cf. DA Pamphlet#165-13, Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups).If the CID proposes to prosecute everyone who takes his/her clothes off for areligious ceremony, Fort Leavenworth will shortly be filled to capacity with agreat many unadorned bodies. [In an effort to minimize his Baptistaffiliation, Cates recently insisted to Tinti that he is inclined towards theNative American Church. Native American religion includes many instancesof nude/semi-nude ceremonies, and the NAC reportedly uses the- 476 -hallucinogenic drug peyote as a religious sacrament. Perhaps that explainssome of the “logic” in this CID report …]f.Paragraph #6.(1) Since this paragraph concludes that the copy-cat allegations by the Witherowchildren were “unsubstantiated”, why are the allegations detailed sographically and disgustingly here, save - again - to imply defamation of me?(2)What the ROI omits to mention is that the apparent root of the Witherowsituation is a long-running, bitter custody fight over the two children, inwhich allegations of “ritualistic sex abuse” were allegedly made by thehusband against the children’s mother and grandfather. From what Iunderstand, the mother’s mentally-impaired brother was ultimately chargedand convicted. This affair occurred before the sensationalistic publicity of theAdams-Thompson attack evidently gave the Witherow father/ stepmotherthe idea to try to coach the children into fresh allegations based on whateverthey could assemble from news media accounts.(3)The new Mrs. Witherow - the father’s new wife - is the founder and promoterof “Victims of Systems”, apparently one more group of zealots dedicated tocreating and promoting “child abuse” witch-hunts. Most notorious is the“Believe the Children” organization, originally founded to inflame theMcMartin situation in Los Angeles. There were efforts to form additionallynch-mob groups of this sort in San Francisco at the time of the Presidioscam as well. This “Victims” group is evidently a similar effort by Witherowto glamorize the publicity she originally attained through use of the children,and to attempt - as with these fake allegations against me - to furthercapitalize on it. Why is none of this mentioned in the ROI?(4)In short, paragraph #6 is worded in such a way as to insinuate its allegationsto the reader without providing any of the truth to expose and discredit notonly the allegations per se but the motives and ethics of their sources as well.9. Statutes.This report substantiates the violation of none of the cited statutes by eithermyselfor Mrs. Aquino. It substantiates the violation of none of the statutes by GaryHambright in any connection with Mrs. Aquino or myself whatever.- 477 -10. Basis for investigation.a. As the CID well knows, the allegation that children in day-care “molestation”scams are taken to off-site locations for abuse has a common, well-known, andutterly-unsubstantiated cliché of such scams for years. It is introduced simplyto enable instigators and promoters of such scams to come up with some way oftrying to get around the impossibility of child sex-abuse in the open andgenerally-supervised atmosphere of the average day-care facility. It isincorrect torepresent this long-since-exposed fallacy as “information”, and the authors arewell aware of this.b. No children have been established as the victims of any sexual abusewhatever in connection with the Presidio of San Francisco scam, and theauthors are well aware of this.c.“Fragmented information” is more properly described as random fantasies as istypical of preschool children. To the extent that the statements of the Presidiochildren - like other groups of children coached by parents, grilled by“therapists”, and questioned endlessly by law-enforcement investigators in suchscams - are similar to those of Kinsey Almond as represented by Debbie Hickey insix months of “therapy” intended to substantiate Hickey’s initial diagnosis of“abuse”, nothing but a confused jumble of nonsense resulted. The notion thatthis“substantiates” anything is preposterous. The medical and law-enforcementliterature exposing this sham practice has now grown to enormous size, and it issignificant of the investigators’ incompetence that they are ignorant of it.[IndeedI provided copies of much of this information to the 6RCID, all of which, ofcourse, is omitted from the CID report entirely.]d. “Mikey”.(1)As the CID is aware, I have never been known by the name “Mikey”. Thatname was never initially mentioned by Almond, and was first introduced toDebbie Hickey by Michele Adams-Thompson on 6/30/87 after she hadpreviously introduced the subject of “Satanism” to Hickey on 6/2/87.(2)According to the CID account of Adams-Thompson’s 8/12/87 telephone callto the FBI, he referred to me as “LTC Mike Aquino”. Only close personalfriends and officers senior to me at the Presidio called me by such anickname; my signature block was “Michael A. Aquino” and, as I habituallydislike nicknames, I avoided entering my name in any other way. PresumablyAdams-Thompson, by his use of this name to the FBI, was trying to implythat there was already a connection to the alleged “Mikey”.- 478 -(3)Nor is there any information that any other child besides Almond evermentioned either name prior to the massive publicity given the Adams-Thompson allegations (including the term “Mikey”) in the San Francisco/national/international media. Nor does it make any sense that I would usemy own name [or home, or wear an Army uniform (at a time when,according to the CID’s desperate backdating, I was on leave status)] if I weregoing to commit crimes such as these.(4)Elsewhere in the CID report Harvey makes an issue the fact that the LaVeys,who were at that time as close as immediate family to me, called me “Mike”in conversational letters they wrote. Under the circumstances it would havebeen rather stilted for them not to have used this term. Similarly they signedsuch letters “Anton” or “Diane”, rather than “Anton Szandor LaVey” or“Diane LaVey”. I never said to the CID that no close friend of mine evercalled me “Mike” throughout my entire life - just that I do not like orencourage the use of the nickname myself.(5)The CID report of the ludicrous “house identification” expedition of 8/13/87reveals that Almond did not identify our home as her stepfather alleged toPamfiloff the next day, and this report has her talking about “Mickie”. We arenow getting rather far afield from “Michael” or even “Mike”.e. There is no substantiation that Almond ever made any of the statements in thePX later alleged by Adams-Thompson to Pamfiloff as part of his “package story”,or was even present at the PX at all. The entire account of the PX encounterby the adult Adams-Thompsons is full of lies, inconsistencies, and physicalimpossibilities as detailed at Attachment #W.219 The authors, of course, arewellaware of this.f.In particular, in none of the original “package story” versions did eitherLawrence or Michele Adams-Thompson allege that Almond had said the phrase“That’s the bad man, that’s Mikey.”g. The statement that “USACIDC monitored and assisted the SFPD investigation”:(1) This is, from my knowledge, true only to the extent that two CID personnelwandered around curiously inside our home during Pamfiloff’s 8/14/87midnight raid.(2)Thereafter there was no indication whatever of any CID interest orinvolvement: no flagging of my file, no suspension of clearance, not so much219 Appendix #34.- 479 -as a single contact or question from the CID. If possible violations of all ofthese statutes were involved, it is absurd to think that the CID would allowsuch an officer to go about his Army duties for one year and three monthswithout taking any action whatever.(3)According to my military attorney Captain Hayes, the truth is that inNovember 1988, when political pressure was suddenly put on the CID toframe me following the 10/25/88 Geraldo show, the files of the SanFrancisco Field Office of the CID concerning the Adams-Thompsonallegations were a “complete mess”. It was necessary for me to provideHarvey with a complete set of documents concerning the allegations, which Ivolunteered on the assumption that the CID’s investigation was intended tobe a bona-fide attempt to clear the air. I have not seen any evidence that theCID maintained any systematic file, much less a “monitoring/assisting”effort, prior to the Geraldo-inspired framing campaign.h. The statement that “in September 1988 SFPD terminated active investigation”isfalse. The San Francisco District Attorney formally closed the SFPDinvestigation on August 1, 1988. This “September” lie was apparently writteninto this cover letter to attempt to conceal the fact that, for three andone-halfmonths after the closing of the SFPD investigation, the CID did nothing at allabout it - and in fact only initiated an investigation in November because ofpost-Geraldo political pressure.i.The statement that “the [SFPD] investigation had not generated sufficientevidence to convince civil authorities that prosecution had a high probabilityofconviction” is false. The SFPD investigation, after a year, had produced noevidence whatever that any such crimes were ever committed at all, much lessthat they were committed by Mrs. Aquino or myself. 220 In fact the SFPD’sinitiation and handling of that investigation resulted in (1) an InternalAffairsinvestigation of the officers concerned within the Police Department, andsubsequently (2) an investigation of those same officers by the San FranciscoPolice Commission. Attachment #X is the letter of findings against thoseofficersby the Police Commission, sustaining the many violations by Pamfiloff in theSFPD investigation and the many violations by Gallant in her pre-Adams-Thompson campaign of defamation against ourselves, our church, and ourreligion.j.As the SFPD uncovered no evidence of any crime, whatever briefing Pamfiloff/Gallant gave the 6RCID on 11/21/88 cannot have provided any justification for220 See also Glenn Pamfiloff’s confirmation of this in 1991 & 2000 (Chapter #4).- 480 -the CID’s opening a new investigation. [If this briefing is so significant, whyis atranscript or summary of it not included in the ROI?]k. There is no “medical evidence” to consider. Contrary to what Lawrence Adams-Thompson alleged in his “package story” to Pamfiloff, Kinsey Almond is a virginshowing no signs of rape by two adult males - nor any medical signwhatever of any molestation. Nor is there any evidence of the Adams-Thompson’s taking Almond for any molestation-type medical treatment duringeither the September-October 1986 period or the CID-later-invented May-July1986 period.l.It is interesting to see the CID admitting that it “considered the FBI records”,because, throughout this investigation, the CID investigators were complainingtoHayes that the FBI records were closed to them, hence that they had to start“from the beginning”. This admission by the CID that it did in fact have accessto the FBI records makes this present titling effort that much moreconspicuouslyfraudulent, as the CID knew about the exonerating contents of the FBIForm FD-302, 1/14/87 at the time when it opened this investigation.m. Exactly what “coordination” took place on 11/21/89 between the 6RCID and thePresidio SJA remains somewhat murky. An undated memorandum from TJAGstates only that “on 23 November 1988, LTC Craig Schwender, the SJA at thePresidio of San Francisco, reported that the CID titled LTC Aquino”. Schwenderalso seriously misled TJAG concerning “the evidence”, as is detailed inAttachment #Y, page #5. Consequently his objectivity in determining “probablecause” is impeached.n. “Sufficient evidence” did not exist to initiate this ROI.(1)Quite the contrary, massive evidence existed, and was known to the CID,proving Mrs. Aquino and myself utterly innocent of Adams-Thompson’sallegations and proving Chaplain Adams-Thompson conclusivelyguilty of Specification #1 of the charges I preferred against him inJanuary 1988. The CID has deliberately acted to cover up Adams-Thompson’s crime in violation of Article 134 UCMJ, and - by continuing torefuse to produce the report it prepared in response to those charges - isfurther acting to cover up this violation of Article 134.(2)Throughout this investigation the 6RCID suppressed and concealed from myattorneys and myself evidence that proved the innocence of Mrs. Aquino andmyself, such as the FBI FD-302 1/14/87. Had the Federal Public Defender’sOffice in San Francisco not informed me of the existence of this documentand provided me with a copy of it, I have no doubt it would continue to have- 481 -been suppressed by the CID. Unsurprisingly it does not appear as an exhibitin the CID report.11. Indictment of Hambright.a. What is the relevance of stating that Hambright was indicted for allegedcrimesagainst children not the subjects of this ROI? He was never indicted for anyalleged crime against Kinsey Almond - nor against Emily Dorsey, for that matter.Nor does any of this have anything to do with the Adams-Thompson attackagainst Mrs. Aquino and myself.b. Why does the CID ROI not go on to mention that all of these indictmentsagainstHambright were ultimately dismissed by the court and never prosecuted?c.Once again the inclusion of this irrelevant, slanted paragraph is simply to addfraudulent, defamatory impact against Mrs. Aquino and myself.- 482 -Appendix 61: Analysis of 6RCID Report of Investigation NarrativeLt.Col. Michael A. AquinoDecember 22, 1989Major General Eugene L. CromartieCommanding General, USACIDC5611 Columbia PikeFalls Church, VA 22041-5015Dear General Cromartie:Enclosed are my comments and corrections to the “Narrative” portion of thefraudulent Sixth Region CID report concerning Mrs. Aquino and myself.As was the case with the cover letter to that report, the narrative does notsubstantiate the titling of either Mrs. Aquino or myself for any alleged crimewhatever.To the contrary, it provides clear evidence of the crimes of Chaplain LawrenceAdams-Thompson as concealed to date by the Sixth Region, and of massive violations ofArticles 133 and 134 of the UCMJ, and of CID regulations, by the report authorsandColonel Ray as signatory and Sixth Region commander.I can continue in this manner through the entire report, if you insist, to thecontinued discredit and embarrassment of the U.S. Army CID in front of allcommanders and Army executives with an interest in this affair. As you know, Iwill notfor a moment tolerate crimes against my wife or myself, whether byAdams-Thompsonor by a CID regional headquarters which has made its contempt for the UnitedStatesConstitution, and its assumption of CID invulnerability from U.S. law and theUCMJ,quite clear.This exercise is, however, a waste of my professional time, hence the taxpayers’time.I once more ask, that without further delay, you rescind the fraudulent reportandremove the titling of Mrs. Aquino and myself.As you know, I have re-preferred charges against Adams-Thompson for his crimes,and I expect that the 25th Division, after once having been embarrassed beforetheWESTCOM Commanding General because of the 6th Region CID’s deliberatemisinformation, will take greater care concerning the RCM 303 inquiry this time.As for the criminal actions of Major Harvey, Chief Warrant Officer Cates, andStaffSergeant Penaluna in preparing this report, and of Colonel Ray in signing it, itis your- 483 -responsibility to investigate your Sixth Region headquarters and San FranciscoFieldOffice and take corrective action as appropriate.The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command has a crucial responsibility fortheprevention and detection of crime in the Army. Because of the serious harm thatcouldbe caused to soldiers wrongly accused of crimes, it is incumbent upon all CIDpersonnelto maintain the most rigorous ethics in their investigations. It may be easy fora seniorofficer such as myself to expose CID misconduct of an investigation, but themajority ofCID investigations focus on junior soldiers who may not have such analyticalskills.Such soldiers trust in the CID to conduct fair, impartial, and objectiveinvestigations,and indeed to set a standard for the entire Army by obedience to the law.The conduct of the Sixth Region CID headquarters in this affair is absolutelydisgraceful. That the same persons responsible for this appalling abuse ofinvestigatoryethics should escape accountability for their actions, much less continue inpositions ofresponsibility to investigate other U.S. Army personnel in the Sixth Regionarea, is anoffense to the U.S. Army, and to the laws of this nation, which you asCommandingGeneral should not tolerate.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

Colonel Michael A. Aquino[This analysis was provided to the Commanding General,CIC on December 22, 1989. Neither acknowledgment norresponse was received.]Statements by the Sixth Region CID (6RCID) are inItalics. My own responses to the 6RCID statements are inregular type1. Summary of Significant Information1.1.a. K. ADAMS-THOMPSON [Kinsey Almond], as well as four other children,during the course of a previous investigation (0667-86-C1D026-69776),alleged that they were taken off-post and sexually assaulted by variouspeople, including “Mr. Mike or Mikey”.(1) In the original Hickey notes through 8/10/87, and in any other accountprior to Adams-Thompson’s invention of the “package story” on8/12/87, Kinsey Almond never alleged that she was “taken off-post andsexually assaulted by various people including ‘Mr. Mike or Mikey’”.Rather Almond responded in many different and inconsistent ways tosuggestive questions by Hickey. For the CID to represent one out ofscores of combinations of such various responses as a single, coherent“allegation” is a clear falsehood. This information is omitted from the6RCID report.(2) There is no record of “four other children alleging that they were takenoffpost and sexually assaulted by any ‘Mr. Mike or Mikey’” anywhere inthis CID report, nor in the media, nor in any other documents of which Iam aware. This information is omitted from the 6RCID report.(3) There is no record of Almond ever using the phrase “off-post” orotherwise specifying this. This information is omitted from the 6RCIDreport.(4) In the pre-8/12/87 Hickey “therapy” sessions, Hickey prompted Almondthrough several different versions of “the trip”: no trip at all [twice](4/7), to “Sassy and Todo’s house” (4/7), to a house with a garage, a tree- 486 -house, a swing set, and a fence [none at 123 Acme] (4/7), to “Kathy’shouse” (5/12), to a “house with real animals” [none at 123 Acme] (5/19),to “Mr. Gary’s house” (6/2), and to a “Dr. Steve’s house” (6/23).(5) None of the other children’s accounts of any “trips” substantiate orcorroborate the Almond responses as to location.(a) The 6RCID deliberately omits this contradictory/discreditinginformation from this summary, instead insinuating that Almondand “four other children” had given a single, believable account ofone trip to a specific house.(b) There is no record of the 6RCID or anyone else ever trying toidentify “Sassy”, “Kathy”, or “Dr. Steve” or search for suchresidences on- or off-post.(c) In particular Almond specifically and repeatedly (6/2, 6/9)identified “Dr. Steve” as being with Hambright at “the house”.Michele Adams-Thompson acknowledged that she knew “Dr. Steve”and that he was a neighbor of the Adams-Thompsons. No effort wasmade by the CID to investigate “Dr. Steve” or search his house.(d) On 5/12 Almond identified the house as “Cathy’s”. Jaime Parkersaid on 7/8 and 7/31 that the house was “Katie Fry’s” (same firstname), and on on 7/31 Parker’s mother told Hickey that “Katie hadapproached her and said she used to take kids to her house to go tothe bathroom when they would go to Sanchez Park”. No effort wasmade by the CID to investigate “Katie/Cathie Fry” or search herhouse.(e) Therefore two specific (and one by two children) identifications ofactual individuals occurred during Hickey’s “therapy” sessions -neither of which was investigated at all by the FBI or CID.Why therefore was a nonexistent “identification” of Mrs. Aquinoand myself pursued so frantically by the CID)?(5) There is no record in the Hickey notes of Almond ever using the name“Mr. Mike”. On 7/8 Jaime Parker referred to a man at Katie Fry’s houseas “Frank”, then on 7/17 called the same person “Mr. Mike”. No effortwas made by the CID to investigate a “Frank or Mike in connection withKatie Fry”. [In the CID report #8.1 the CID states that it interviewedJaime Parker and showed her photographic lineups and that she “wasnot able to provide any information of value to this investigation”.]- 487 -(6) There is no record in the pre-”package story” Hickey notes of Almondever saying that “Mikey” was present at any of the locations to whichHickey reports Almond said she was taken. The allegation that “Mikey”was present first appears in the FBI FD-302 report on 8/13/87, uponAdams-Thompson’s invention of the “package story”. This informationis omitted from the 6RCID report(7) This statement by the 6RCID report authors and signatory is thus a falseofficial statement in violation of Article #133 UCMJ and an act toobstruct justice in violation of Article #134 UCMJ.b. [Almond] reported that she had been taken to Mr. Gary’s house by Mr.Gary in a green car.(1) Almond has changed the color of the supposed car every timequestioners have suggested a car-ride to her. It was “blue” (4/7), “red &white” (4/21), then “green” (8/13), then “red” (later that same 8/13morning). Accordingly Almond’s account of a car-ride, and the color ofthe supposed car, are unreliable and unbelievable. This informationis omitted from the 6RCID report.(2) In the Hickey sessions prior to her stepfather’s 8/13/87 “package story”,Almond mentioned several features of the house/houses to which shewas supposedly taken [after first denying twice to Hickey that shewas taken anywhere (4/7)]: the color is blue (4/7), the house isKathy’s (5/12), the house is Dr. Steve’s (6/23), the house has a garage, atree house, a swing set, and a fence (4/28). Inside are dinosaurs that bitpeople (4/7), a golf book and golf balls (4/7), a Bible with “poopoo on it”and a “bad cross that went peepee” (5/19), a bathtub with lion’s feet(6/2), a pot hanging from the ceiling with arms and legs and a penishanging out of it (6/2), and that Mr. Gary cut a baby open and that therewere a varying number of babies in alternating black and white colors(5/19, 5/26/, 8/10). None of these features match our house. The6RCID deliberately omits this contradictory/discreditinginformation, instead insinuating that Almond had given a single,believable account of one trip to a specific house.(3) Our house on Acme Avenue is not, of course, “Mr. Gary’s house”. GaryHambright has never resided or visited there. The 6RC1D deliberatelyomits this contradictory/ discrediting information.(4) In point of fact Almond does not use the expression “Mr. Gary’s house”herself anywhere in the Hickey notes. The phrase is always introduced- 488 -(first 4/7) and used by Hickey to seek a response from Almond. [The4/7 Hickey notes add that Michele Adams-Thompson had alsoproposed the “trip to Mr. Gary’s house” theme to Almond prior to thatsession - and that Almond had denied any such trip to her mother aswell.] Obviously neither Michele nor Hickey were about to let such aninconvenient denial stand. After her initial three denials of such a tripwere ignored, Almond presumably realized that she was expected to say“yes”.(5) Gary Hambright cannot drive anyone anywhere, being an epileptic withneither a car nor a driver’s license. The 6RCID deliberately omitsthis contradictory/discrediting information. Furthermore the6RCID concealed this information from my attorneys and"},{"pageContent":"myself; I was advised of it only by the Federal Public Defender’s Office.(6) 1-1/2 years later, in another attempt to manufacture evidence inviolation of #134 UCMJ and explain away the impossibility ofHambright driving, the Adams-Thompsons invented the idea of Mrs.Aquino driving the car and coached it into Almond, who in a 4/7-8/896RCID interview, obediently contradicted her earlier 8/13/87recitation accordingly. [In that same interview she then re-contradicted herself by saying that it was “Mr. Gary” who took her.]This information is omitted from the 6RCID report.(7) This statement by the 6RCID report authors and signatory is thus a falseofficial statement in violation of Article #133 UCMJ and an act toobstruct justice in violation of Article #134 UCMJ.c. While there, Mr. Gary placed his penis into her bottom, her vagina, and hermouth.(1) There is no record in the pre-”package story” Hickey notes of Almondever using the phrase “Mr. Gary placed his penis into her bottom, hervagina, and her mouth”. This phrase first appears in the FBI FD-302report on 8/13/87, after Adams-Thompson’s invention of the “packagestory”. This information is omitted from the 6RCID report. [On 4/7Hickey said that Almond said that “she put Mr. Gary’s penis in hermouth and Mr. Gary put his penis in her bottom”.](2) As the 6RCID is well aware, from an FBI interview on 1/26/87: “WhenMrs. Adams-Thompson asked if Mr. Gary had been mean toher or tried to touch her, Kinsey replied negatively. ” As the FBIinterview closest to the time-period specified in the Adams-Thompson- 489 -allegations [and in the revised time-period invented by the 6RCID tomanufacture evidence], this is the most reliable interview and is ofcourse of vital importance. Yet its existence was concealed fromme by the 6RCID, and it is omitted altogether from this 6RCIDreport.(3) There is, of course, no corroborative evidence of any sort that Almondwas ever taken to any house at any time per the Hickey notes, Adams-Thompson’s “package story”, or Almond’s later attempted recitationsthereof. The 6RCID is well aware of this, yet does not mention it in thereport.(4) As 6RCID is well aware, Almond has been medically examined andfound to be a virgin, with “no physical evidence of sexualabuse” . [See item #5, Adams-Thompson’s Violations of #133 UCMJ,11/29/89.](5) This statement by the 6RCID report authors and signatory is thus a falseofficial statement in violation of Article #133 UCMJ and an act toobstruct justice in violation of Article #134 UCMJ.d. According to [Almond], also present at the house were “Mikey” and“Shamby”.(1) This allegation first appears in the FBI FD-302 report on 8/13/87, afterAdams-Thompson’s invention of the “package story”. Prior to hisfabrication of the “package story”, there is no account of Almond herselfever linking “Mikey” and “Shamby” together, placing them in the samelocation, or even discussing them at the same time. This information isomitted from the 6RCID report.(a) “Shambee” first appears in the 1/27/87 Hickey Session, introducedby Almond as “her friend at school who was spanked by Mr. Rogerson TV”.(b) “Mikey” was never mentioned initially by Almond, and there is nomention of this name whatever until 6/30/87 - after Micheleintroduced the idea of a “Satanic cult” to Hickey on 6/2/87. On6/30/87 it is Michele - not Almond - who introduces “Mikey” toHickey, alleging that “Mikey is Shambee’s husband”. None of thiswas mentioned by Almond herself during that session, nor didHickey ask her questions about any of it.- 490 -(2) In the Hickey sessions Almond states no feature of “Shambee” or“Mikey” to suggest any identification with either Mrs. Aquino or myself.In fact Almond never gives any physical description of“Shambee” or “Mikey” at all. The oft-quoted statement that “Mikeywore an Army suit with a stripe on the pants” was made by Michele toHickey on 6/30/87 and never repeated by Almond herself to Hickey.(3) The 6RCID’s unqualified attribution of this part of the Adams-Thompson “package story” to Almond is thus an attempt to manufactureevidence and obstruction of justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.e. She stated “Mikey” had put his penis into her mouth, bottom and vagina(Paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) This is a statement by FBI Agent Clyde Foreman writing a report ofhis interview with Almond on 8/13/87. The exact words are notnecessarily Almond’s. Almond said (6/30/87) that Mikey “put his penisin her mouth and peed on her, and put poo-poo in her mouth”. Duringall of the preceding sessions she had made the same statementsconcerning (a) Hambright, (b) “little boys”, (c) all of the children at “thehouse”, (d) Sassy, (e) Todo, (f) the cross, (g) the bible, (h) the femaledoll, (i) the penis in the pot hanging from the ceiling with arms and legsin it, and (j) Dr. Steve.(2) As 6RCID is well aware, Almond has been medically examined andfound to be a virgin, with no physical evidence of sexual abuse. [See item#5, Adams-Thompson’s Violations of #133 UCMJ, 11/29/89.](3) Although Adams-Thompson alleged in his 8/13/87 “package story” thatthe multiple rape/sodomy happened between 1 September and 31October 1986, there is no evidence that he ever noticed anythingwrong with Almond, nor took her for an emergency medicalexamination of this nature at any point during that period[nor during the 6RCID-later-invented MayJuly 86 period].(4) Although two rapes and two sodomies, which Adams-Thompson allegedwere committed by two adult males, would also have severelytraumatized a 3-year-old, there is no published evidence thateither Lawrence or Michele ever noticed anything wrong withAlmond nor took her for psychiatric help during September/October 1986 [nor during the 6RCID-later-invented May-July86 period].- 491 -(5) The 6RCID’s unqualified attribution of this part of the Adams-Thompson “package story” to Almond is thus an attempt to manufactureevidence and obstruction of justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.f. [Almond] and Dana Smith, during therapy, mentioned the name “TODO” asone of their assailants (paragraphs 14.1 and 143, this report).(1) There is no evidence in the CID report that Dana Smith ever mentionedthe name “Todo”. There are no “therapy” or interview notes concerningSmith provided as an exhibit to the report. In the CID report #8.1 theCID states that it interviewed Dana Smith and showed her photographiclineups and that she “was not able to provide any information ofvalue to this investigation”.(2) Nowhere in the Hickey/Almond notes is “Todo” described as having“assailed” either Almond or any other child in any way. Almond’s onlydescription of “Todo” is that he had first “blond” (4/27/87) and then“green” (4/28/87) hair. The 6RCID deliberately omits thiscontradictory/ discrediting information.(3) The 6RCID’s statement here is thus deliberately false in violation ofArticle 133 UCMJ and, as used, is an obvious attempt to manufactureevidence and obstruct justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.g. On 13 Aug 87, [Almond] identified a red 1987 Isuzu Mark I automobile, CAlicense 2ENS452, as “Shamby’s” car, in which [Almond] had ridden with“Shamby” (paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) This fact exposes the “package story” as Adams-Thompson’sinvention of the previous day, and also exposes the coachingof Almond to make a bogus “identification”. The 8/13/87 6RCIDreport by SA Potter editorially states that Almond picked out the redIsuzu as “Mrs. Shamby’s” car and said that she had ridden in it with her.This was of course after Michele and Lawrence Adams-Thompson hadconnected that car with us at the PX on 8/12/87, but before theydiscovered it to be only a rental car which we had had for only a coupleof days previously.(2) Neither Mrs. Aquino nor I owned or drove a red car during the singleweekend trip we made to San Francisco during the September-October1986 time period (alleged to be the time of the incident in Adams-Thompson’s “package story”). We drove a rental car, which was not redor any color close to red [as verified by its rental company receipt].- 492 -(3) Neither Mrs. Aquino nor I owned or drove a red car during the6RCIDreinvented May-July 86 period. We drove our own car, which wasnot red or any color close to red.h. On 7-8 Apr 89, [Almond] stated Mr. Gary’s house contained a bath tub withlion’s feet and a shower with a glass door (paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) This is thus exculpatory evidence. Our home in San Francisco containsneither a bathtub with lion’s feet nor a shower with a glass door, as the6RCID knows. Our bathtub is a modem, built-in tub with no feet at all,and it has a shower curtain.i. On 7-8 Apr 89, [Almond] stated she went to Mr. Gary’s house on severaloccasions and that Evan and Cohn Fox, Kara Bailey, and Kelly Quigleywere present on most of those occasions (paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) Not later than April 1987 Adams-Thompson made his first, pre-”packagestory” allegation against Gary Hambright for sexually abusing Almond.“Such act or acts took place sometime in September or October 1986 atthe Child Development Center, Presidio of San Francisco.” [Letter,Presidio CDS Director to Hambright, 4/17/87]. Adams-Thompson wasspecific about the time and location, and no allegation was madeof the child being transported elsewhere or of anyone else beinginvolved.(2) As the 6RCID well knows, the allegation that children in day-care“molestation” scams are taken to off-site locations for abuse has been acommon, well-known, and utterly-unsubstantiated cliché of such scamsfor years. It is introduced simply to enable instigators and promoters ofsuch scams to come up with some way of trying to get around theimpossibility of child sex-abuse in the open and constantly-supervisedatmosphere of the average day-care facility.(3) In the original Hickey notes there was no clear mention of any morethan a single “trip”, alternately to “Mr. Gary’s”, “Kathie’s”, and “Dr.Steve’s” house; and the “house” changes its appearance, decor, andinhabitants every time another interrogator leads Almond through thedrill. Clearly the whole notion of an actual trip or trips crediblyrecounted by Almond is utterly discredited.(4) Per Captain Hayes (telephone discussion 5/5/89), the Fox and Quigleychildren were videotape-interviewed by SA Cates and both denied this- 493 -account. This further impeaches Almond’s truthfulness and reliability.This information is omitted from the 6RCID report as provided to me.(5) The 6RCID’s unqualified attribution of this part of the revisedAdamsThompson “package story” to Almond is thus an attempt tomanufacture evidence and obstruction of justice in violation of Article134 UCMJ.j. On 7-8 Apr 89, [Almond] stated Mr. Gary had threatened her with a gun,saying he would shoot her with it if she ever told her parents what hadhappened (paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) Such a significant and presumably-frightening “event” as this was nevermentioned by Almond in the Hickey notes, nor by Adams-Thompson inhis initial “package story”. Obviously it is a tacked-on addition, yearslater, to add additional drama to the allegations. Like “offsite transport”,“being threatened with weapons” is an invariable, routine feature of“day-care child molestation” scams generally.(2) Hickey herself introduced the general subject and specific term “gun”into the Almond “therapy” sessions, asking Almond on 4/7/87 “if therewas a gun there”. Almond’s response was, “Yes, Mr. Gary told Sassy hewould kill her.” ... which makes no sense if the CID is trying to equate“Sassy” with “Shambee” and propose her as a conspirator withHambright.* * * * *What this “Summary of Significant Information” actually reveals is that:• No information exists to substantiate the report or the titling action.• Abundant information exists to disprove the allegations and exposeAdamsThompson as a deliberate, malicious liar.• The 6RCID authors and signatory were all in possession of the exculpatoryinformation cited above, yet omitted mention of it.• Manufacture of evidence by both Adams-Thompson and the 6RCID, asevidenced above, is a violation of Article 134 UCMJ.• Omission and suppression of the evidence cited by me above, in that such actsby the 6RCID shelter Adams-Thompson from accountability for his crime- 494 -against Mrs. Aquino and myself, constitute multiple acts of Misprision ofSerious Offense and Obstruction of Justice by the 6RCID in violation of Article134 UCMJ.• Attempts by the 6RCID to shelter Adams-Thompson from accountability forhis crime are further attempts by the 6RCID to cover up its own violations ofArticles 133 and 134 UCMJ in its “investigation” of the 1/4/88 court-martialcharges against him. Hence this 6RCID report, furthering this 6RCID cover-upattempt, is also in this respect a violation of the Misprision of SeriousOffenseand Obstruction of Justice provisions of Article 134 UCMJ.This “Summary of Significant Information” is thus a deliberate, willful seriesoffalse official statements in violation of Article #133 UCMJ, and a series ofacts in violation of Article #134 UCMJ.* * * * *Evidencek. On 12 Aug 87, [Almond] identified Lt. Colonel Aquino and Mrs. Aquino as“Mikey” and “Shamby” respectively (paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) Paragraph 4.1 contains no evidence whatever that Almond“identified” anyone on 12 Aug 87 (the date of the alleged incident in thePresidio PX) or was even present herself at the PX on that date. All thatis established is that Lawrence and/or Michele Adams-Thompsonwere present in the PX that day and saw us there, preparatory to theirinvention of the “package story” later that same day. As part of that“package story”, the Adams-Thompsons alleged Almond’s involvementat the PX, changing their accounts of this involvement, and changing thenumbers of persons there, several times from 8/13/87 until the present.[See Section #C “The August 12, 1987 Presidio Post Exchange Incident”,Chaplain Lawrence AdamsThompson’s Actions in Violation of Article133, UCMJ, updated 11/29/89.](2) The 6RCID is aware of this information, yet omits mention of it here.Hence this unqualified 6RCID statement is a false official statement inviolation of Article 133 UCMJ and an act of obstruction of justice inviolation of Article 134 UCMJ.1. On 12 August 1987, Captain Adams-Thompson reported [Almond] hadidentified Lt. Colonel and Mrs. Aquino as “Mikey” and “Shamby” at the PX,PSF, CA. He also noted Lt. Colonel and Mrs. Aquino got into a red 1987- 495 -Isuzu Mark I automobile, CA license 2ENS452, which [Almond] identified as“Shamby’s” car (paragraph 3.1, this report).(1) All this establishes is that Adams-Thompson made a personalallegation to the 6RCID after seeing Mrs. Aquino and myself at the PXand noticing the car in which we drove off.(2) As noted above, there is no evidence that Almond made any such“identification” at the PX, or was even present.(3) Adams-Thompson’s assumption that the red Isuzu was ours, and hisconsequent coaching of Almond to “identify” it to support hisallegations, led to her doing just that the next morning. As Adams-Thompson did not know at the time, of course, the Isuzu was a rental carwhich we had had for only a couple of days, and had not even beenregistered to the rental company until 7/87. This is conclusiveevidence both of the Adams-Thompsons’ coaching of Almond tosupport their “package story” and of the deliberate falsification of that“package story”.(4) The 6RCJD is aware of this information, yet omits mention of it here.Hence this unqualified 6RCID statement is a false official statement inviolation of Article 133 UCMJ and an act of obstruction of justice inviolation of Article 134 UCMJ.m. On 13 August 1987, [Almond] identified Hambright as Mr. Gary from aphotographic lineup (paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) This statement is not evidence of any crime committed by Mrs. Aquinoor myself.n. On 13 August 1987, [Almond] identified 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco,California, as the location to which she was taken by Mr. Gary (paragraph4.1, this report).(1) Although this “identification” was hyped repeatedly in the mediaimmediately after Adams-Thompson made his attack, no evidence tosubstantiate it was ever produced from the time of his attack untilNovember 1989, when I finally managed to obtain a [heavily censored]copy of this 6RCID report concerning myself.(2) The 6RCID report of that “identification trip”, as finally exposed uponmy obtaining of this 6RCID report concerning myself, establishes that- 496 -Almond did not make any such identification of 123 AcmeAvenue. The only “identification” she made was of the red Isuzu,which, as noted above, was an impossible and obviously pre-coached“identification”. [See Section #D “The 123 Acme ‘Identification’ Trip”,Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson’s Actions in Violation of Article133, UCMJ, updated 11/29/89.](3) The 6RCID is aware of this information, yet omits mention of it here.Hence this unqualified 6RCID statement is a false official statement inviolation of Article 133 UCMJ and an act of obstruction of justice inviolation of Article 134 UCMJ.o. On 7-8 April 1989, [Almond] identified a female who is not a suspect in thisinvestigation as “Shamby” from both photographic and video line-ups(paragraph 9.19, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence, substantiating Mrs. Aquino’s innocenceand discrediting any “identification” of “Shamby” by Almond.(2) If such great emphasis is being placed in children’s “identifications” tosubstantiate the Presidio scam and justify the titling of two innocentpersons despite the overwhelming evidence proving our innocence, thenwhy was the person so “identified” by this child automatically ruled “nota suspect in this investigation”? This was a repeated identification - bothphotographic and video. Was this “identified” person’s photosubsequently shown to other CDC children? Was a search warrantsought for her home? Was an “identification” trip made to her home?Was a strenuous effort made to find any conceivable way of “titling” orindicting her? It is no argument that she might be a CID or other law-enforcement official, as such persons are no more privileged or exemptfrom suspicion than anyone else.(3) On 1/27/87 Almond said to Hickey that “Shambee” was “her friend atschool whom she played with”, “who had its neck broken”, and who wasspanked by Mr. Rogers on TV.p. On 7-8 April 1989, [Almond] identified Lt. Colonel Aquino as “Mike” fromboth photographic and video line-ups as the individual whom she hadpreviously identified in the PX, PSF, CA (paragraph 9.19, this report).(1) The use of a photographic line-up by the 6RCID after 1-1/2 years ofAlmond being exposed to my face in the media, and of course bycoaching and reinforcement from Adams-Thompson and Michele, is- 497 -absurd. The technique used is further in explicit violation of CIDRegulation CIDR 195-1 (1 November 1986), which states:(a) “A line-up is appropriate when the witness does not know theidentity of the perpetrator.” [5-1 1.a.(2)]. By April 1989, ofcourse, it would be absurd for Almond not to recognize my nameand face as a consequence of their continuous media exposure andthe obvious interest of her stepfather and mother in reinforcing hersupport of their “package story” in preparation for the 6RCIDperformance.(b) “The persons portrayed in the photographs should be reasonablysimilar in appearance.” [5-11 d. (1) (b)]. All other individuals on thephoto line-up as used by the 6RCJD, as seen by Captain Hayes, looknothing like me whatever. Not one of them has either of my twomost distinctive features (a pronounced widow’s peak andsharplyupturned eyebrows). To call such persons “similar inappearance to me” would be like calling Mr. Spock “similar inappearance” to the other crewmen in Star Trek. When suggesting avideo lineup in his 10/17/88 letter, Major [then Captain] Harveysaid specifically that the alternate persons “will not need to all havepointed eyebrows and the widow’s peak”. In fact none of them hadeither of these crucial features.(2) In viewing the videotape of this 6RCID interview (a videotape which Ihave not personally seen), JAG Captain Thomas Hayes has stated that,when shown my picture, Almond said, “That’s him!” in a happy, excitedvoice “as though she were expecting to be rewarded for herperformance”. She showed no sign of displeasure or distress whatever.(3) There is, of course, no record of Almond “identifying” my face to anyonefrom a line-up before April 1989.(4) Following the August 1987 Adams-Thompson attack, InspectorPamfiloff showed a photographic lineup to 26 other Presidio children.Not one of these children “identified” my photograph. This isalso significant since, at the time of her April 1989 interview, Almondwas reciting a revised version of the “package story” to includeseveral other children.(5) Obviously a “photo identification” by Almond in April 1989 is noevidence whatever in substantiation of Adams-Thompson’sallegations, or the 6RC1D titling action taken against me.- 498 -(6) This statement in the “evidence” section is thus no “evidence” at all -except of 6RCID’s violation of CIDR 195-1 and consequent attempt tomanufacture evidence in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.q. On 7-8 April 1989 [Almond] was unable to identify 123 Acme Avenue, SanFrancisco, California from a photographic line-up as the location to whichshe had been taken (paragraph 9.19, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence.(2) In fact, as noted above, Almond never “identified” 123 Acme in thefirst place, as alleged by the 6RCID and SFPD.(3) From the morning of August 13, 1987, of course, both Lawrence andMichele Adams-Thompson knew exactly what the exterior of 123 Acmelooked like, as did Almond, who had been taken there and shown it byher mother on 8/13/87 [and possibly on 8/12/87 as well].r. On 7-8 April 1989, [Almond] stated she had been taken by “Shamby” andM r . G a r y t o M r . G a r y ’ s h o u s e , i n a r e d c a r , w h i c h wa s“Shamby’s” (paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) This statement does not substantiate any “titling” of Mrs. Aquino ormyself.(2) “Shambee” was never associated with Mrs. Aquino by Almond in sixmonths of Hickey “therapy” sessions. It was Michele Adams-Thompson who first proposed to Hickey that “Shambee” be changedfrom “a friend at school” to “the wife of an Army officer” on 6/30/87.(3) This 4/7-8/89 statement once more impeaches the reliability of anystatements by Almond, as “Shamby” is now added to the car whichformerly contained just “Mr. Gary”, the house remains “Mr. Gary’s”, andthe color of the car changes from several other colors cited in the Hickeynotes.(4) Obviously the Adams-Thompsons added “Shamby” as a driver of the carupon discovering that Gary Hambright is an epileptic who cannot driveand doesn’t own a car (information concealed from me by 6RCID).(5) As already established, neither Mrs. Aquino nor I either owned or renteda red car during the time of either Adams-Thompson’s original “package- 499 -story” allegation (September-October 1986) or the 6RCID-later-inventedallegation (May-July 1986).s. On 7-8 April 1989, [Almond] denied that “Mikey” and/or “Shamby” hadever done anything bad to either her or to other children in her presence(paragraph 4.1, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence, of course, even if the mysterious “Mikey”and “Shamby” are assumed to be myself and Mrs. Aquino (which ismerely the Adams-Thompson “package story” allegation, is nototherwise substantiated, and is contradicted by statements from otherPresidio day-care children). Hence it does not support the allegations ofthis 6RCID report or the 6RC1D titling of Mrs. Aquino or myself.t. On 14 August 1987 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco, California wasverified to be the residence of Lt. Colonel and Mrs. Aquino (paragraph 5.A.1., this report).(1) This is not “evidence” which supports any alleged “crime” whatever. 123Acme has been our family home for three generations!u. On 14 August 1987, during the conduct of a search, photographs wereexposed depicting the interior of the 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco,California which do not support the bath tub or shower with a glass door asreported by [Almond] (paragraph 5.A.3., this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence, which substantiates our innocence andthe deliberate falsification of the “package story” by Adams-Thompson.(2) The supposed interior of “Mr. Gary’s house” was proposed to the SFPDon 8/14/87 by Lawrence Adams-Thompson, not by Almond.(3) No “shower with a glass door” was included in the original 8/12-14/87“package story” invented by Adams-Thompson. This additional revisionto the many revisions of the “package story” first appears 1-1/2 yearslater, after the Adams-Thompsons knew that 123 Acme has a modern,not an old-fashioned tub. [Nevertheless our bathtub still does not have aglass door, but just a shower-curtain.]v. On 4 January 1988, 23 August 1988, 22 November 1988, 27 January 1989,and 10-11 May 1989, Lt. Colonel Aquino rendered sworn written statementsand sworn testimony in which he denied any criminal misconduct anddenied ever being known as “Mike” or “Mikey” (paragraph 6.1, this report).- 500 -(1) This is a false statement by the 6RCID in violation of Article 133UCMJ. It is correct that I denied ever being called “Mikey”, and that isthe truth. It is not correct that I denied ever being called “Mike”. Asexplained in my sworn statement of 1/27/89 (in answer to 6RCIDquestions), my childhood nickname was “Archy”, and, as I dislikenicknames, I habitually use “Michael” rather than “Mike” personally andamong junior acquaintances. Persons older and senior to me,(particularly in the Army, where anything beyond a one-syllablenickname would be regarded as an affectation), occasionally take theliberty to call me “Mike”. I see nothing the least bit peculiar or sinister inthat.(2) Paragraph 6.1 of the 6RCJD report reports my statement to the 6RCIDthat “while his military contemporaries frequently call him ‘Mike’, hedoes not like this name and is not called that by any person(s) outsidehis military acquaintances”.(a) Elsewhere in the 6RCID report Major Harvey makes a considerablefuss about Anton and Diane LaVey having addressed me as “Mike”in their personal correspondence with me [but not to any otherofficials or members of the Church of Satan] during the 1969-1975time of our close friendship. As the LaVeys and I were all then asclose as family, this is not the least surprising. After myestrangement from the LaVeys in 1975, my statement to the 6RCID,which is in the present tense, remains exactly true as stated.(b) Indeed Anton LaVey singled out this well-known preference of minefor highlighting in his book The Compleat Witch (Dodd, Mead1970/71, page #61), in which he said: “‘Mike’ is an all-around guy,whereas ‘Michael’ is serious and romantic.”(3) The Hickey notes establish that as far back as June 1987 it had occurredto the Adams-Thompsons to fabricate allegations against me, basedsimply upon the well-known fact that I was a prominent Satanist andthat it had become an accepted and widespread tactic of “day-care childmolestation” scams to allege “Satanic ritual” responsibility andinvolvement.(4) I stand absolutely by all of my sworn statements as identified above ascontaining the truth as it was known to me at the time of the statementin question. Not a single statement in any of these sworn statements hasbeen impeached by the 6RCID or anyone else.- 501 -w. Lt. Colonel Aquino reported his residence at 123 Acme Avenue, SanFrancisco, California and the property at 121 Acme Avenue, San Francisco,California underwent major structural changes and painting commencingabout December 1985 and being completed about Jan 87 (paragraph 6.1,this report).(1) This is not “evidence” which supports any alleged “crime” at all.x. During interview, while under oath, Lt. Colonel Aquino stated he taughtclasses for the Golden Gate University from 1979 until the fall semester 1985(paragraph 6.1, this report).(1) I made no such statement under oath to the 6RCID, and their allegationthat I did so is thus a false official statement in violation of Article 133UCMJ.(2) What I told 6RCID is that I began teaching at Golden Gate University inthe Fall Semester 1980. [It would have been impossible for me to havebegun teaching there in 1979, as we did not even move to San Franciscountil 1980 and I did not receive my Ph.D. (enabling me to qualify toteach at GGU) until 1980.]y. On 4 January 1988 and 11 May 1989, Mrs. Aquino rendered a swornwritten statement and sworn testimony in which she denied any criminalmisconduct (paragraph 6.2, this report).(1) This is not “evidence” which supports any alleged “crime” whatever.Mrs. Aquino’s statements were and are completely true, and aresubstantiated by all of the evidence, including abundant evidence which6RCID has omitted from its report in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.z. It was ascertained 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco, California is two milesin distance from the Child Development Center, Presidio of San Francisco,California, requiring 7 minutes 14 seconds driving time (paragraph 5.A.1.,this report).(1) This is not “evidence” which supports any alleged “crime” whatever.There is nothing special about “7 minutes, 14 seconds” in terms of the“package story” or any other variation on it, and there are thousands ofresidences in San Francisco which are within an equal or shorter drivingtime from the Presidio day-care center - including, of course, on-posthousing itself.- 502 -aa. On 8 April 1989, Michele Adams-Thompson stated [Almond] had identifiedLt. Colonel and Mrs. Aquino as “Mikey” and “Shamby” on 12 August 1987 inthe PX, Presidio of San Francisco, California (paragraph 7.8, this report).(1) This is merely Michele’s reciting of the “PX story”, 1-1/2 years later. Thatstory has been shown to be so compromised by the Adams-Thompsons’efforts to revise it since first alleging it, that it is of no evidence ofanything except their efforts to prop up and adjust theiroriginal lies. [See Section #C “The August 12, 1987 Presidio PostExchange Incident”, Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson’s Actions inViolation of Article 133, UCMJ, updated 11/29/89.]ab(1). On 12 April 1989 Joshua Thompson [a son of Adams-Thompson byprevious marriage] identified a female who is not a suspect as the femaleidentified as “Shamby” by [Almond] at the PX, Presidio of San Francisco,California, on 12 August 87. Further, he identified Lt. Colonel Aquino as themale identified by [Almond] as “Mikey” (paragraph 7.10, this report).ab(2). On 12 April 1989 Timothy Thompson [another son of Adams-Thompsonby previous marriage] identified a female who is not a suspect as the femaleidentified as “Shamby” by [Almond] at the PX, Presidio of San Francisco,California, on 12 August 87. Further, he identified Lt. Colonel Aquino as themale identified by [Almond] as “Mikey” (paragraph 7.11, this report).(1) Although they made several statements to the FBI, the 6RCID, and theSFPD in August 1987 at the time they saw us in the Presidio PX, theAdams-Thompsons made no mention whatever of the presence orinvolvement of the two boys until 1-1/2 years later. Clearly thetwo boys, and still another Adams-Thompson child, were added to thestory later on to try to prop it up, and the boys instructed by their fatherand/or Michele to parrot the story. The two boys were approximately 9and 13 at the time of the PX incident, hence would have been importantwitnesses at that time.(2) Obviously by April of 1989 the entire Adams-Thompson familyought to know quite well what both Mrs. Aquino and I look like. Even so,both boys “identified” another woman other than Mrs. Aquino ashaving been present in the PX, which impeaches their credibilityconcerning the “identification” of myself.(3) Again, if such sacred emphasis is being placed in children’s“identifications” to substantiate the Presidio scam and justify the titlingof two innocent persons despite the overwhelming evidence proving ourinnocence, then why was the person so “identified” by these boys- 503 -automatically ruled “not a suspect in this investigation”? Was this“identified” person’s photo subsequently shown to other CDC children?Was a search warrant sought for her home? Was an “identification” tripmade to her home? Was a strenuous effort made to find any conceivableway of “titling” or indicting her? It is no argument that she might be aCID or other law-enforcement official, as such persons are no moreprivileged or exempt from suspicion than anyone else.ac. On 12 April 1989 Mrs. Jennifer L. Thompson [A-T’s previous wife] relatedshe is aware of no information which would indicate that Captain Adams-Thompson, for religious or other reason(s), would attempt to alter orinfluence the testimony of [Almond] regarding this matter (paragraph 7.12,this report).(1) This is an absurd statement for Jennifer to make. As she is well aware, ifAdams-Thompson cannot convince Almond to recite his “packagestory”, he faces exposure and possible criminal prosecution for it, bothfrom the Army and the San Francisco Police Department. That wouldnot be in her sons’ interests, of course, nor in hers if she receives anyalimony or child-support from him.(2) Furthermore, as I expect Jennifer is also well aware, the Adams-Thompsons have made several million dollars in fraudulentclaims against the government based on his “package story”. If thatstory is exposed, Lawrence and Michele Adams-Thompson once againface possible criminal prosecution for it - and no Adams-Thompson(including, of course, Jennifer and the two boys) would become instantmulti-millionaires.(3) Lawrence Adams-Thompson is a Christian clergyman with an centraland compelling bias against the Satanic religion.ad. During the course of this investigation no child who attended the PresidioofSan Francisco Child Development Center and was interviewed, with theexception of [Almond], identified either Lt. Colonel or Mrs. Aquino as one oftheir assailants (paragraphs 4, 7, and 8, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence which further discredits Almond’sstatement to the contrary, substantiates our innocence, and contributesto the exposure of the Adams-Thompson “package story” as afabrication.- 504 -ae. During the course of this investigation no child who was interviewedidentified 123 Acme Avenue, San Francisco, California from a photographicline-up, as a location to which they had been taken (paragraphs 8 and 9,this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence which further discredits Almond’sstatement to the contrary, substantiates our innocence, and contributesto the exposure of the Adams-Thompson “package story” as afabrication.af(l). On 19 April 1989, Evan Fox denied ever leaving the Presidio of SanFrancisco Child Development Center with anyone other than his parentsand denied ever being sexually assaulted (paragraph 8.1, this report).af(2). On 19 April 1989, Cohn Fox denied ever being sexually assaulted off-post.af(3). On 23 April 1989, Kara Bailey denied recognizing either Lt. Colonel orMrs. Aquino, or having ever been sexually assaulted at the Presidio of SanFrancisco Child Development Center (paragraph 8.1, this report).(1) This is all exculpatory evidence which substantiates our innocence.(2) This is also a misleading understatement of paragraph 8.1 of the 6RCIDreport. Its initial two sentences are: “During the course of thisinvestigation the following children who were reported victims ofritualistic sexual abuse, at various locations in CA, were interviewed andprovided the opportunity to view photographic line-ups. None wereable to provide any information of value to this investigation. ”ag. Kelly Quigley was not interviewed based on the desires of her parents(paragraph 18.1, this report).(1) This statement is not evidence of any alleged crime whatever.ah. On 5 January 1989 and 20 January 1989, Ms. Blood denied ever havingseen any human sacrifice and/or children in Temple of Set rituals(paragraph 8.3, this report).(1) This statement is exculpatory, not evidence of any alleged crime.Regarding the rest of Linda Blood’s statements to the 6RCID, however:(2) Ms. Blood is also an individual whose extreme and aggressive personalhostility towards Mrs. Aquino and myself is well known anddocumented to the 6RCID. She has repeatedly demonstrated both herirrational hatred of us and her willingness to lie about ourselves, herself,- 505 -and the Temple of Set as long as her statements about her own pastinvolvement do not jeopardize her own present media posture as an“anti-cult crusader”. Ms. Blood was expelled from the Temple of Set forunacceptable sexual behavior, after only a few months as a member.(3) The 6RCID’s use of Blood’s testimony in this investigation, despite thefact that she knows no more about the Adams-Thompson attack thanany other member of the newswatching public, and despite theirknowledge that she is a hostile, irrational, and unreliable individual,further evidences the 6RCID’s deliberate and prejudicial conductof this investigation. The evidence provided by me to the 6RCIDshowing Blood to be an unreliable source of information is notpresented in the report: recordings of years of obscene, sado-masochistic, and threatening messages left on on our telephoneanswering machine [and my aged mother’s], her counseling by theLexington, Massachusetts Police Department because of this, etc.(4) Nor did the 6RCID make any effort to include in the report interviewswith any of the thousands of reputable persons over the last 43 yearswho can attest to my integrity and that of Mrs. Aquino. Except whereunavoidable, the report contains only propaganda designed to defameus, by persons with an obvious interest in doing so.ai. On 31 January 1989 Ms. Cynthia Angell reported she has been informed theSayer children, Bridgette and Charles, reported having been sexuallyabused at the Presidio of San Francisco Child Development Center in thepresence of or under the direction of a person they characterize as “MichaelKeno” (paragraph 8.4, this report).(1) Angell is an attorney for the father in yet another child-custody case inwhich “Satanic child abuse” tactics are being employed against the otherparent in an attempt to win custody. The details of Angell’s statementare evidence of no crime whatever by Mrs. Aquino or myself, andwere, like the other Sonoma/Mendocino copy-cat allegations, simply anattempt to try to exploit the massive publicity given the Adams-Thompson attack on us during the previous year and a half. It isnoteworthy that in none of the Sonoma/Mendocino attacks were thereany Aquino-oriented statements or allegations until long after theAdams-Thompson attack had become a massive media event throughoutthe entire country and northern California in particular.(2) On 13 November 1990 Angell appeared on the Geraldo Rivera show andtwice falsely stated that she had “issued a subpœna for Michael Aquino”.- 506 -When on 19 November 1990 my attorney Mr. Matthew Wertheim askedher for a copy of such “subpœna”, she never responded. [Nor was anysuch subpœna ever served on me.](3) #8.4 of the CID report relates Angell’s account of her “Satanickidnapping” seriously. Further on the Geraldo show Angell said: “They,they, put me, they, one man got into my car, pushed a gun up against myside, told me to take a drive. As I drove, he told me that I’d beeninvestigating things that I shouldn’t be investigating, that I was involvedin something I shouldn’t be involved in, and that unless I dropped thiscase immediately that they would kill me. They took me outside of thetown, at which point I was blindfolded, put into another car - there weretwo men at that point - they drove me around for two, perhaps threehours and simply threatened me and told me that these things were realand that I shouldn’t pursue the case any further.”(a) At first Angell says that two men kidnapped her. Now she says thatonly one man kidnapped her, and that the second man appearedonly at a switch to a second car. Yet before “that point” she said“they took me”. So did the second man just “appear” in her carwhile she was driving it?(b) After Angell had already had a good look at the two men during the“quite lengthy” drive, why should they then bother to blindfold her?Why should it take 2-3 hours to make 30-seconds-worth of threats?Why should criminals try to convince a witch-hunt attorney that“these things were real” if their interests lay in promoting the viewthat “Satanic child abuse” is not real?(c) Obviously Angell did not drop the case, and by the time she went onGeraldo (11/13/90) she cited no further threats against her. Nor,obviously, was she murdered. In fact she felt confident enough to goon Geraldo Rivera and tell a detailed story about the supposed“abduction”.(4) I think it is reasonable to say that the truthfulness and ethics of Angellare impeached.aj. On 14 February 1989 Louis D. Seago, a former member of the Temple of Set,stated he has no knowledge of the use and/or abuse of children during histenure with the Temple. Further, he indicated he is aware of neither Lt.Colonel nor Mrs. Aquino having any sexual preferences which includechildren. He did, however, state it would be typical of Lt. Colonel Aquino to- 507 -connect with someone of opposing ideology and elicit them to engage in anactivity which would conflict with their beliefs. He further advised Lt.Colonel Aquino had spoken of a ritual chamber in the apartment of 121Acme Avenue, San Francisco, California (paragraph 8.5, this report).(1) Seago’s correct name is “Lewis D. Seago” aka “L. Dale Seago”.(2) As with Blood, Seago is a hostile individual who was expelled from theTemple of Set for unethical behavior by a vote of the majority of thePriesthood.(3) As a Captain in the USAR, Seago was later forced to undergopsychiatric examination for misconduct at Fort Huachuca,with findings sufficiently adverse to discredit his reliability asa witness. The 6RCID is well aware of this, yet omits mention of it inthis report.(4) As the 6RCID knows, but as it also omits to mention in this report,Seago deliberately contributed to the scare-propaganda of the 10/25/88Geraldo Rivera “Satanism” show by stating on camera to Rivera that “aSatanic organization was active on the Presidio and that the authoritieswere aware of it”. Seago used the pseudonym of “Joseph” on that show,but identified himself on camera as an officer in the U.S. Army, andRivera acknowledged that his identity would be concealed by keeping hisface off-camera.(a) There was, of course, no Satanic organization active at the Presidio.The Temple of Set held no activities there at all, and, followingSeago’s expulsion, I was the sole member of the Temple at thatinstallation.(b) Seago’s false and deliberately alarmist allegation was extremelyembarrassing to Presidio Commander Colonel Joseph Rafferty, whowas shown on camera denying any knowledge of Satanic activitythere immediately after Seago’s statement. Rafferty had noknowledge of what Seago had said, or who he was, until thebroadcast aired on television - at which moment I placed animmediate telephone call to Rafferty to verify Rafferty’s statementand identify Captain Seago to him.(5) Seago has no grounds whatever to suggest that I would “connect withsomeone of opposing ideology and elicit them to engage in an activitywhich would conflict with their beliefs”. It is well-known that I discuss- 508 -and debate theological, philosophical, military, and political scienceissues with colleagues; indeed my skill and success at doing so have beensingled out for OER/AER entries and academic evaluations. As for“eliciting someone to engage in an activity in conflict with his beliefs”,that is preposterous and quite unsubstantiated. Nor does such a vaguestatement, even if it were true, constitute evidence of any “crime”whatever.(6) There is not and has never been any ritual chamber at 121 Acme Avenue,and so of course I could not have discussed this with Seago.ak. On 14 February 1989, Mr Jack Cooper, an Estate Probate Appraiser,indicated he had appraised the properties at 121 and 123 Acme Avenue, SanFrancisco, California. He advised he has no recollection of any bath tubwith lion’s feet or a shower with a glass door. Nor did he recall any ritualchamber (paragraph 8.6, this report).(1) This evidence is exculpatory.al. On 21 February 1989, Mr Donald Corwell, who installed the security systemin LTC AQUINO’s residences, indicated he had no recollection of any bathtub with lion’s feet or a shower with a glass door. Further, he did not recallany ritual chamber (paragraph 8.7, this report).(1) This evidence is exculpatory.am. On 6 December 1988, CID Special Agent Penaluna obtained airline ticketspertaining to Lt. Colonel and Mrs. Aquino for the period 14-18 June 1986(paragraph 11.1, this report).(1) This statement is not evidence of any alleged crime whatever.an. Between 1 March 1989 and 8 April 1989 attempts were made to obtain theoriginal of a diary containing disclosures made by [Almond] to MicheleAdams-Thompson. It was determined that the original diary was made ofnotes on various scraps of paper which were later combined and copied.The present whereabouts of the original documents is unknown (paragraph11.2, this report).(1) The existence of this “diary” is merely alleged by Michele Adams-Thompson, and “disclosures made to her by Almond” are also nothingbut long-after-the-attack inventions made by her in an attempt tosupport her and her husband’s equally-invented “package story”.- 509 -(2) In paragraph 11.2 of the 6RCID report it is stated that Adams-Thompsonrefused to give 6RCID the original diary on the advice of his civilianattorney. Why refuse, if it provided important evidence substantiatingserious crimes committed against his stepdaughter? If, on the otherhand, analysis of the diary and its entries would have exposed his andMichele’s “package story” as a fabrication, then his refusal toprovide it to the 6RCID is quite understandable.(3) Five days after Adams-Thompson’s refusal to give the original diary tothe 6RCID, Michele Adams-Thompson now told the 6RCID that theoriginal diary had been “lost” (paragraph 11.2 of the 6RCID report). It isvery curious that a diary which Adams-Thompson acknowledged havinga week earlier, and in which he had been advised of the 6RCID’s specialinterest, would suddenly “become lost”.(4) What actually happened and why is quite clear:(a) Michele provided the 6RCID a photocopy of a page from thepurported “original diary” in which (out in the margin, not in thebody of the entry of that date) she wrote that Almond had saidsomething about “a room with soft walls”.(b) Michele never mentioned nor provided any such diary entry to theSFPD during its original investigation 1-1/2 years previously.(c) After all of the media publicity surrounding the raid on our home,of course, and after being shown the FBI/SFPD photographs of allrooms in our home on 10/291987, the Adams-Thompsons knew thatwe have a little room with padded walls (originally decorated thusby my father when the room included a wetbar).(d) If Michele could provide some kind of “accurate interiordescription” which appeared to predate the raid, it would be usefulto the sale of the “package story”. Hence she wrote the entry in themargin after-the-fact, and provided only a photocopy of the page tothe 6RCID so that laboratory analysis could not be used to comparethe ages of the ink, the type of writing instrument, etc.(5) The doctored photocopy of a page of Michele Adams-Thompson’s “lost”diary is evidence only of the continuing effort of the Adams-Thompsonsto try to substantiate their disintegrating “package story” by belatedrevisions to it, hence this manufacture of evidence by them in violationof Article 134 UCMJ.- 510 -ao. During the course of this investigation a credit check was conducted on Lt.Colonel Aquino and the Temple of Set. No contact could be establishedbetween either Aquino or the Temple and Hambright, or other employees ofthe Presidio of San Francisco Child Development Center (paragraph 13.1,this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence in that it substantiates what we have saidabout there being no contact whatever between ourselves and eitherGary Hambright or the Presidio daycare center.(2) It must again be said that neither Hambright nor anyone else connectedwith the day-care center has been convicted of any crime in connectionwith the Presidio “molestation” scam, nor even brought to trial on same.Hambright is therefore entitled by law to the presumption of innocence,and his name should not be used, as the 6RCID is obviously trying to doin this report, as “evidence” of a “crime” all by itself.ap. On 3 January 1989 information was received indicating a review of Lt.Colonel Aquino’s medical records had disclosed no treatment for any sexualtransmitted diseases (paragraph 14.2, this report).(1) I do not see the relevance of this entry to the report, nor is it evidenceofanything relative to the Adams-Thompson allegations. Kinsey Almondhas been medically established as showing no physical signs of sexualabuse whatever (paragraph 14.4, 6RCID report).aq. On 4 March 1989 coordination was effected with Sergeant/InspectorPamfiloff, San Francisco Police Department, who advised he hadinterviewed Staff Sergeant Clifton Jones, who reported Lt. Colonel Aquinowas absent from his duty position from 1100-1400 on Tuesday andThursday, due to his teaching commitments. Further, he establishedchildren in the Presidio of San Francisco Child Development Center werenot under direct supervision from 1200 through the remainder of the day.Additionally, he provided a handwriting enhanced page from the notebookof Mrs. Aquino which read “wants to call Dave (Dale) and ask if he is thesource of that porn stuff... (unreadable)” (paragraph 175, this report).(1) GGU teaching.(a) SSG Jones’ memory is understandably unreliable, as he was notexpected to monitor my noontime teaching schedule. Fromsemester to semester I sometimes taught on Monday/Wednesday,othertimes Tuesday/Thursday.- 511 -(b) Under the arrangements I had with the Presidio commander and myown director, I was on a very tight schedule to change to civilianclothes, drive downtown to the Sutter/Stockton garage, park, walk 6blocks to the GGU campus, teach class from 12 noon to 1:15, andthen reverse the process to get back to my desk at the Presidioheadquarters building by 2PM. [GGU also kept a meticulous recordof the attendance of every professor, with missed sessions to bemade up.] It is absurd for Pamfiloff to imply that in the middle ofsuch a tight, supervised scheduled I would have had the time tocommit a crime such as that alleged by Adams-Thompson.(c) Moreover, as GGU records substantiate, I had stopped teachingthere long before either the Adams-Thompson-alleged timeperiod or the 6RCID-invented time period. [The death of my motherin December 1985 left me with too many estate responsibilities tocontinue teaching in addition to my Army responsibilities.](2) PSF CDC children not being under direct supervision after noon:(a) What does “direct supervision” mean? Certainly the center musthave kept track of children left there sufficiently well for them not towander off the premises and get lost or be hit by a car! If whatPamfiloff means is that the children were in a “general play”environment rather than in specific classes, that does not mean thatthey would have been any the less supervised by adults, or that itwould have been any the easier for them to be kidnapped,repeatedly raped & sodomized, and returned back to the CDCwithout anyone noticing anything unusual!(b) During the original “package story” September-October 1986 timeperiod, it has been proven that Mrs. Aquino and I were inWashington, D.C. on all dates on which Almond was left at the CDC.(c) Gary Hambright, as verified by a 12/15/86 letter from Lt. ColonelWalter W. Myer, Director of Personnel and Community Activities,HQ Presidio, at no time during his entire employment at theCDC supervised children under the age of 3. As KinseyAlmond did not turn 3 until 9/1/86, Hambright could not haveh a d h e r u n d e r h i s c a r e o r c o n t r o l d u r i n g t h e6RCIDinvented May-July 1986 time period. Also during thattime period, as verified by the San Francisco Public Defender’sOffice, Almond was only a “drop in” child, being left at the center forirregular and unscheduled periods of time by her parents. A would-- 512 -be kidnapper would have no way of knowing when they wouldreturn to pick up the child.(3) A handwriting enhanced page from the notebook of Mrs. Aquino whichread “wants to call Dave (Dale) and ask if he is the source of that pornstuff... (unreadable)” (paragraph 17.5, this report).(a) This “enhanced” page was shown to both Mrs. Aquino and myself bythe 6RCID. It is a blank portion of notebook paper showingimpressions apparently from the sheet above it which is no longer inexistence. Both Mrs. Aquino and I found the “enhanced” portionunreadable and could not recognize it conclusively.(b) Shortly after his expulsion from the Temple of Set, Dale Seago madecontact with Linda Blood, which resulted in a renewed barrage ofpornographic messages from her on our telephone answeringmachine. The note was most probably an unacted-upon memo toconsider calling Seago and ask him about the Blood calls.(c) Nevertheless this page has no relevance at all to the Adams-Thompson allegations or to this 6RCID investigation generally.ar. On 9 March 1989, during a review of the notebook of Mrs. Aquino (whichwas seized by the San Francisco Police Department during the search of theAquino residence) the name “Mike Todo” was located (paragraph 19.10, thisreport).(1) This notebook page, as explained to the 6RCID by Mrs. Aquino, showeda list of names and phone numbers of persons who had telephoned toinquire about an apartment at 121 Acme which we had been advertisingin the San Francisco Chronicle. It would have been easy for the 6RCIDto check this information by calling the phone numbers on thatnotebook page. [We were told that they did try the “Mike Todo” numberand found it disconnected. This is not surprising if he had beenshopping for an apartment at the time he gave that number!]as. On 23 March 1989 it was ascertained Lt. Colonel Aquino was in acontinuous leave status from 2 June 1986 until 18 July 1986 (paragraph19.11, this report).(1) All officers (including myself) selected for resident attendance at theIndustrial College of the Armed Forces August 1986-1987 were informedthat there would be almost no opportunity to take leave during the- 513 -school year. As I had accumulated quite a bit of leave-time, therefore, Itook the excess prior to my departure from the Presidio. I don’t seeanything the least bit sinister in that, particularly since there was a lot ofpainting and construction work going on at Acme which required dailyattention from me.at. On 23 March 1989 the employment history of Lt. Colonel Aquino withGolden Gate University was obtained, which reflects he was employed in ateaching capacity from Spring 1979 until Fall 1982 (paragraph 19.12, thisreport).(1) Paragraph 19.12 of the 6RCID report contains substantialmisinformation, apparently because the GGU person from whom it wasobtained consulted incomplete or incorrect records. I commencedteaching at GGU in the Fall Semester 1980, after receiving my Ph.D. thatsummer from the University of California, and I taught until 1985, whenthe serious illness and then death of my mother made it impossible forme to continue. Almost all of my weekday courses were taught in thenoon-1:15 time period, and I also taught occasional evening courses attwo GGU offcampus sites in the Bay Area. I have of course copies of allof my GGU contracts on file to verify this.au. On 13 April 1989 it was determined that the 1987 Isuzu identified by[Almond] was first registered on 22 July 1987 to Budget Rent-a-CarSystems (paragraph 20.7, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence.av. On 29 March 1989 it was determined neither Lt. Colonel Aquino or Mrs.Aquino have ever had a red sports type car registered in CA (paragraph20.6, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence.aw. On 5 May 1989 Mr. Anton LaVey was interviewed and throughout thecourse of the interview he referred to Lt. Colonel Aquino as either “Mike” or“Mikey” (paragraph 7.16, this report).(1) Anton LaVey has made no secret of his intense hatred for me and theTemple of Set since I exposed his intentions to financially exploit theChurch of Satan for his personal profit in 1975. That scandal resulted inthe mass resignations of almost every official of the Church, and broughtabout its end as a functioning organization. [The same persons who- 514 -resigned from the Church because of LaVey’s attempted corruption of itformed the Temple of Set as a corrective religious institutionimmediately thereafter.](2) It is regrettable, but not particularly surprising, that Anton LaVey wouldsay everything he could to try to harm to Mrs. Aquino and myself via hisinterview with the 6RCID. He has made it abundantly clear over theyears that he has not the slightest hesitation about lying when it suits hispurposes.(3) Paragraph 7.16 of the 6RCID report contains a number of otherdeliberately defamatory lies by LaVey, all easily refuted, which will beaddressed in a critique to that paragraph.(4) For the third time in this ROI (Blood, Seago, LaVey) the CID includesstatements from persons whose common thread is that they arewell-known personal enemies of myself, Mrs. Aquino, and theTemple of Set. Two of them were expelled from the Temple in disgracefor ethical misconduct (and have personal records of sexual abnormalitythemselves), and the third has an intense and widely-advertised hatredof Mrs. Aquino, the Temple of Set, and myself. Clearly, by highlightingonly these three individuals as “character/Temple of Set” references,and by concealing their personal histories, abnormalities, and biases, theCID is attempting to assassinate our character and to defame theTemple of Set rather than to paint an accurate and objective picture.This is clearly an obstruction of justice in violation of Article 134 UCMJ.ax. A comparison of the telephone toll charges to the telephone of Lt. ColonelAquino with that of Hambright disclosed no charges for calls to anynumber identified with Hambright. Further, no charges to any worker ofthe Presidio of San Francisco Child Development Center were located in Lt.Colonel Aquino’s telephone records (paragraph 19.19, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence.ay. A comparison of available telephone toll charges to the telephone ofHambright disclosed no charges for call to the number of either Lt. ColonelAquino or the Temple of Set (paragraph 19.19, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence.az. Angelique Jefferson identified two of her assailants as “Shamby” and“Mikey” to her mother (paragraphs 19.18.A and 19.18.C, this report).- 515 -(1) The detailed accounts in 19.18 are so utterly preposterous, and so clearlyfictitious, that for the CID to single out “Shamby” and “Mikey” formention in this summary is nothing more than an attempt to insinuate,hence manufacture evidence where in fact there is none. This is an actof obstruction of justice in violation of Article 134, UCMJ.(2) These statements are from Jefferson’s mother in a “journal” dated 13/14December 1988 - well over a year after the Adams-Thompson attackwas widely sensationalized in the media and it had been announced thatthe CID was opening yet another investigation of them.(3) Like the other Sonoma/Mendocino copy-cat allegations, this one issimply an attempt to try to exploit the massive publicity given theAdams-Thompson attack on us during the previous year and a half. It isnoteworthy that in none of the Sonoma/Mendocino attacks werethere any Aquino-oriented statements or allegations until longafter the Adams-Thompson attack had become a massivemedia event throughout the entire country and northernCalifornia in particular.ba. The names “Shamby” and “Mikey” were identified in local news media,prior to the report by Ms. Hartnett, Angelique Jefferson’s mother(paragraphs 6.1 and 17.13, this report).(1) This is exculpatory evidence and impeaches Hartnett’s allegations “onbehalf of Jefferson” above.bb. On 21 May 1989, during the course of an interview, Master [Steven Jr.?]Quigley identified Lt. Colonel Aquino from a photographic line-up as anindividual he had seen in the Child Development Center, Presidio of SanFrancisco, California (paragraph 7.17, this report).(1) On 21 April 1988 the parents of this child, Steven and Lisa Quigley, filedclaims totaling $4,500,000 against the government for alleged “abuse”of Kelley and Steven Jr. in the Presidio scam. Clearly they have a strongmotive for encouraging their children to promote anything (such as theAdams-Thompson attack against us) to support the scam.(2) If this is one of the same Presidio day-care children to whom Pamfiloffshowed a photographic line-up without any “identifications” of me overa year earlier, the reliability of this child’s “later memory”, or histruthfulness, is impeached.- 516 -(3) As established in #1.1 p. (1) above, the 6RCID’s use of a photo line-uptechnique in this investigation is invalid and in specific violation ofCIDR 195-1.(4) By May 191989 my face had become well-known to everyone with aninterest in the Presidio scam, so it is easy for anyone to make off-the-cuffallegations (all completely unsupported, of course).(5) As I have stated repeatedly, I have never been to the Presidio day-carecenter, hence this child’s statement is untrue.(6) Why in the entire 6RCID report are there no interviews with anyadult who worked at the day-care center? Is it because no suchadult ever saw Mrs. Aquino or myself there? As is commonknowledge, I have a unique appearance and was well-known around thePresidio during the five years I was assigned there. [Gary Hambright hasalready gone on written record that he has never seen us or met us eitherthere or anywhere else, and Mrs. Aquino and I have sworn repeatedly tothis same truth.]1.2a. On or about 4 January 1988 Lt. Colonel Aquino falsely swore a charge withtwo specifications on a DD Form 458 against Captain Adams-Thompson,alleging a violation of Article 133, UCMJ on the part of Captain Adams-Thompson. Lt. Colonel Aquino alleged Captain AdamsThompson had madefalse accusations against Lt. Colonel Aquino and had sent a derogatorypostcard to Lt. Colonel Aquino. Subsequently, in a later sworn statement,Lt. Colonel Aquino withdrew the second specification regarding thepostcard, based on information he obtained indicating Captain Adams-Thompson was not at the Presidio of San Francisco, California on the postdate of the card (paragraph 6.1, this report).(1) This is a clear and deliberate lie by the 6RCID in violation ofArticle 133 UCMJ. The charges that I preferred against Adams-Thompson in January 1988, and my sworn statement in support ofthem, were based absolutely on the truth as known to me at thattime.(2) As has since been uncovered by me via the Freedom of Information Act,the 6RCID deliberately suppressed the investigation of thecharges against Adams-Thompson and misled theCommanding Generals of the 25th Infantry Division and- 517 -WESTCOM concerning them. This act by the 6RCID constitutes aclear act of Misprision of Serious Offense and Obstruction of Justice inviolation of Article 134 UCMJ.(3) This attempt to obstruct justice was continued at the CIDCheadquarters in Washington, D.C. , wherein the Staff JudgeAdvocate represented to me that no such CID report of investigation hadever existed. When I responded with documentary evidence that it didexist, the CIDC headquarters had no alternative but to send it to me -after illegal refusals for well over a year.(4) Accordingly the 6RCID effort to title me for “false charges” againstAdams-Thompson in this report is merely one more effort to cover upserious corruption in the 6RCID and its San Francisco Field Office. If the6RCID were to admit that the charges and sworn statements were true,then its whole attempt to whitewash Adams-Thompson and frame Mrs.Aquino and myself would be exposed for what it is.Evidenceb. Sworn statements of Lt. Colonel Aquino, in which he alleges CaptainAdamsThompson falsely accused him (exhibit 5, 6, and 8).(1) All true on the basis of all information known to me at the time of thestatements in question. I since acquired considerable additionalevidence documenting and substantiating Adams-Thompson’s crimes,and re-preferred charges against him accordingly. None of thisevidence has ever been refuted by the CID.c. Review of both FBI and San Francisco Police Department files whichindicate the allegations made against Lt. Colonel Aquino were made by[Almond] (paragraphs 4.1, this report).(1) A direct lie by the 6RCID in violation of Article 133 UCMJ. The originalSan Francisco Police Department incident report, and Pamfiloff’sindependent verification, states that it was Lawrence Adams-Thompson who told him the “package story” on 8/14/87. 221(2) My attorney was not provided with copies of the 8/13/87 FBI FormFD-302s in which Agent Foreman interviewed all three Adams-221 As documented in Chapter #4, Kinsey Almond/A-T was not even present duringthe Pamfiloffinterview of Larry A-T.- 518 -Thompsons (Lawrence, Michele, and Kinsey Almond) until 4/17/9 1,and I personally did not see them until September 1991.(3) There are several discrepancies and inconsistencies between the 8/13/87Adams-Thompson FBI interviews and the 8/14/87 Adams-ThompsonSFPD interview, exposing the “package story” as a hastily-inventedfabrication which Lawrence and Michele continued to reinvent andrefine - with the CID’s help - as time passed. See Chaplain LawrenceAdams-Thompson’s Actions in Violation of Article 133, UCMJ.(4) By the time these 8/13/87 FBI interviews took place, Lawrence andMichele Adams-Thompson had had over 24 hours to coach Almond intomaking the statements they desired.(5) As these interviews took place after the “123 Acme identification trip”,Almond had had all the more coaching on what she was expected to say,and Michele - having been taken to 123 Acme that morning -could inserta description of its exterior [only!] into her interview.(6) Several allegations of the “package story” appear only in thestatements of Lawrence and Michele to Foreman. The falsehood ofthese elements is detailed in my analysis of these FBI FD-302s and inChaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson’s Actions in Violation of Article133, UCMJ. The “package story” invented by the adult Adams-Thompsons bears no resemblance whatever to the pre-Presidio-PXHickey notes, which further substantiates the invention of the “packagestory” on 8/12/87 and its modification before LawrenceAdamsThompson’s re-telling of it to Pamfiloff on 8/14/87.(7) The FBI FD-302 interview of Kinsey Almond herself contains noidentification of either Mrs. Aquino or myself, or allegationsspecifying us, either in the PX or in any other context.d. Statement of Lt. Colonel Aquino indicating, at the time of the preferral ofthe charges, he had in his possession a copy of the San Francisco PoliceDepartment incident report (exhibit 5 and paragraph 6.1, this report).(1) As stated above, the San Francisco Police Department incident reportverifies that it was Lawrence Adams-Thompson making the“package story” allegations to Pamfiloff, not Almond.- 519 -e. Statement of Captain Adams-Thompson in which he relates he felt asthough Lt. Colonel Aquino’s charges against him were an attempt to havehim coerce his daughter, [Almond] into refuting her original statement(paragraph 42, this report).(1) As Adams-Thompson well knows, by the time UCMJ charges arepreferred, it is too late for the charged person to “retract” his crime -andno longer the prerogative of the charging officer to accept suchretraction. Such misuse of the UCMJ as a “threat” would itself be aviolation of the UCMJ.(2) It is noteworthy that Adams-Thompson was not asked any questions,nor did he offer any answers, to the substantive issues in Specification#1 of those 1/88 charges. All that he said was that he “felt threatened” bythem. [No doubt any soldier facing court-martial charges “feelsthreatened” accordingly.]1.3a. Wesley and Brandon Witherow reported Lt. Colonel Aquino, along withother adults, including their grandparents, fondled their privates, placedtheir (the adults’)fingers in their (Wesley and Brandon Witherow’srespective anuses, and forced them to lie nude on top of nude women andsimulate intercourse. Additionally Brandon Witherow stated he was forcedto perform fellatio on Lt. Colonel Aquino and others. Wesley and BrandonWitherow identified a location on top of a hill near Ukiah, California wherethey had reportedly observed their grandfather bury the remains of hisvictims. Wesley and Brandon Witherow also identified a location (possiblya stock pond) where the remains of persons who had been ritualisticallymurdered reportedly had been placed. Wesley and Brandon Withe rowidentified the Hopland Baptist Church, near the intersection of Highway 101and Highway 175, as the location where they reportedly observed theritualistic murder of a boy named “Timmy”, whose remains were buried infront of the church. Wesley and Brandon Witherow both identifiedAngelique Jefferson as having been an individual they had seen at severalof these occasions. Wesley and Brandon Witherow stated that they andtheir mother, Lori Derryberry, stayed at the home of Lt. Colonel Aquino inSan Francisco, California for about a month. Wesley Witherow stated thathe observed Lt. Colonel Aquino, assisted by his grandfather JackDerryberry, while in the Derryberry home, kill an unidentified female.Wesley Witherow stated he observed Lt. Colonel Aquino ingest controlledsubstances (he believed) through injection and inhalation through the nose,at various locations on unspecified dates. Brandon Witherow stated that Lt.- 520 -Colonel Aquino, J. Derryberry, and the other adults placed the bodies oftheir victims in the pond in Hopland, California. Brandon Witherow statedthat J. Derryberry used underwater swimming gear to place the bodiesunder the water, and then he would place wood on top of them. BrandonWitherow stated that Lt. Colonel Aquino purchased a white ChevroletCamaro for his mother, Lori Derryberry. Both B. and Wesley Witherowreported Hambright was present at the Jubilation Day Care Center in FortBragg, California (where they were taken by J. Derryberry), the Presidio ofSan Francisco Child Development Center, and Lt. Colonel Aquino’s home (atall of which locations they reported they were sexually abused)(paragraphs 43 and 4.4, this report).(1) The evidence cited below “in support of” this “significant information”substantiates none of it whatever. Indeed the evidence exposes all ofit as a fabrication. Hence inclusion of this paragraph as “significantinformation” is clearly inappropriate and obviously with defamatoryintent, hence an obstruction of justice in violation of Article #134 UCMJ.(2) The Witherow “Satanic child-abuse” allegations were merely part of acustody battle, as is a common tactic in such battles. The two boys wereliving with their mother (Lori Derryberry) and her father until May1986, when as a result of abuse-accusations by their father and his newwife (Debi Witherow) they were placed with their father. This battlebegan prior to the Adams-Thompson attack, with of course no Aquino-targeting allegations until more than a year after the Adams-Thompsonsensationalizing in the media. Debi Witherow is a member of theMcMartin activist group “Believe the Children” and herself subsequentlyfounded a similar “child-abuse” scam-promotion group in northernCalifornia named “Victims of Systems”.(3) According to the San Jose Mercury-News 5/17/89, two persons (DarylBall and Charlotte Thrailkill) are in prison in Sonoma Country,convicted [on a plea-bargain] in 1988 of molesting Angelique Jeffersonand five other children. There is no indication that anything resemblingDee Hartnett’s (Jefferson’s mother) 1989 Aquino-targeting allegationsappeared in the Ball/Thrailkill investigation/prosecution/trial, inconnection with either Jefferson or any of the other children. Again noAquino-targeting allegations were made by Dee Hartnett until morethan a year after the Adams-Thompson sensationalizing in the media.(4) Dee Hartnett (Angelique Jefferson’s mother) and Debi Witherow (thechildren’s stepmother) knew one another and appeared in bothtelevision and newspaper interviews together.- 521 -Evidenceb. On 10 January 1989 Brandon Witherow and Wesley Witherow identifiedLt. Colonel Aquino from a lineup as “Mike” or “Michael”, having observedhim on many occasions involved in the ritualistic abuse of children andadults (paragraphs 9.4 and 9.5, this report).(1) By 1/10/89 anyone with an interest in “child-abuse” scams could easily“identify” me from 1-1/2 years’ abundant photo and video publicity ofme following the Adams-Thompson attack on Mrs. Aquino and myself.This “evidence” is evidence only of the lack of ethics in the adultscurrently controlling the two Witherow children.c. On 15 March 1989 Wesley Witherow identified Lilith Aquino as being thegirlfriend of Lt.

Clearly they have a strong motive- 531 -for encouraging their children to promote anything (such as the Adams-Thompson attack against us) to support the scam.1.5a. On 10 January 1989 Kristopher Byrd indicated “Mike” had led churchservices which he attended while in the care of Barbara and Sharon Orr(paragraph 9.6, this report).(1) After local, regional, national, and international news media had beensensationalizing the Adams-Thompson allegations for well over a year, itis scarcely surprising that instigators of other “day-care sex abuse”scams such as that at the Presidio would try for a piece of the action.Barbara and Sharon Orr, according to a major national studyconducted by the Memphis Commercial Appeal, were two sisters whooperated a day-care center in Fort Bragg, California. In January 1985, atthe height of the scam-epidemic, they were suddenly attacked by theusual collection of parents and “therapists”.Under the usual, Debbie Hickey-kind of “therapy”, children dutifullyrecited “rituals in which animals and babies were sacrificed and childrenplaced on meat-hooks and held underwater. Barbara On was alleged tohave cut the children with a long, jeweled knife and sucked their blood.Parents took their children into graveyards to search for clues. Onemother upbraided authorities for declining to send scuba divers offshorein the Pacific Ocean to look for a submarine entrance to an undergroundamusement park.”Obviously there were no missing babies, nor meat hooks, nor knife-cuts, nor underground amusement parks to be found. Nevertheless theinstigators of the scam informed the Commercial Appeal three yearslater that they had a “long term plan to keep the children in therapy anddetermine if they would ever qualify as credible witnesses”.No charges were ever filed against the Orrs, but they were of courseterrorized and professionally ruined. According to the 1/21/88Commercial Appeal:Barbara On, 35, said she deteriorated physically during the ordeal,suffering from stress and severe depression. She said she contemplatedsuicide, but was inspired by others who said they were falsely accused ofabuse. “I guess that’s what really motivated me - getting mad, saying‘No, I’m not going to do this to myself’,” she said.Ms. Orr said she has lost forever the ability to enjoy the company ofchildren. She’s afraid to be left alone with, or show any affection toward- 532 -a child. “It’s something I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over,” shesaid.(2) The 6RCID knows that the attack on the On sisters is one of thefilthiest and ugliest examples of the “day-care sex abuse” scams, andthat there is not the slightest evidence that the Orrs are guilty ofanything. Accordingly, efforts by one of the instigators of that scam topiggyback on Adams-Thompson’s efforts in the Presidio scam areevidence of nothing but the greed and viciousness of that instigator.(3) The 6RCID has no business representing such a transparent, copycatattack as “evidence”, nor of presenting a distorted picture of the attackon the Orrs in disregard of the actual evidence in that affair.Evidenceb. On 10 January 1989 Kristopher Byrd identified Lt. Colonel Aquino as“Mike” from photographic lineups (paragraph 9.6, this report).(1) In January 1989 a worthless “identification”. This statement is notevidence of any alleged crime by Mrs. Aquino or myself whatever.- 533 -Appendix 62: Gary Myers’ Appeal ofthe 6RCID Report of InvestigationMemorandum for:Major General Eugene L. CromartieCommanding General, USA Criminal Investigation CommandFrom:Lt. Colonel Michael A. AquinoThrough:Gary Myers, Esq.Date:31 January 1990Subject:Appeal of Titling Action - CID Report of InvestigationSUMMARY1. This is an appeal from a CID Titling Action regarding Michael and LilithAquino(hereafter “Respondent”).2. The Relief sought is:a. The total expungment of the CID Report of Investigation from the U.S. ArmyCrime Records Center, andb. A communication in writing to all parties on the distribution list of suchreportthat such report has been expunged with further instructions to so inform anyparty in any subsequent chain of distribution.3. Due to impropriety or the appearance of impropriety on the part of certainelementsof the CID and the JAGC, Respondent requests that this appeal be reviewed byelements outside the JAGC and the CID infrastructure. A specific request isherebymade that the General Counsel of the Army be such reviewing authority.4. The bases for the appeal are as follows:a. That the complete defense of alibi exists with regard to the allegations ofConspiracy, Kidnapping, Sodomy, Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child, andSexual Abuse.- 534 -b. That there is no evidence of False Swearing or False Statement; IntentionalNoncompliance with Act 30, UCMJ, Maltreatment of a Subordinate or ConductUnbecoming an Officer, and Indecent Acts.c. That Lilith Aquino is a civilian, not subject to the UCMJ, and is thereforenot aproper party for titling by the United States Army which has no jurisdictionoverLilith Aquino.d. That this titling action resulted from political influence brought upon theUnitedStates Army by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina.e. That elements of the Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps, the Office of theSurgeon General, and the CID acted improperly with regard to this investigation.f. That Respondent was investigated in a timely fashion by the San FranciscoPoliceDepartment and the FBI and no attempt to prosecute was made and that the CIDinvestigation was so stale as to be tainted.g. That Respondent was titled even though the CID knew no charges were"},{"pageContent":"contemplated by command and was so informed prior to the date of titling, andthat the Army knowingly allowed the Statute of Limitations to run prior totitling.DISCUSSIONThis section will address the specific bases for appeal set forth in the summaryabove. Sub-topic e., the improper conduct of elements of the Judge AdvocateGeneral’sCorps, the Office of the Surgeon General and the CID will be addressed as itarises ineach of the other sub-topics.a. That the complete defense of Alibi exists with regard to the allegations ofConspiracy, Kidnapping, Sodomy, Indecent Acts or Liberties with a child, andSexual Abuse.If ever there were a case of investigators attempting to fit a preconceivedconclusion into later-discovered facts, this is that case.All relevant allegations pointed to the fall of 1986 in San Francisco for thealleged abuse of Kinsey Almond, the then-three-year-old stepchild of CaptainAdams-Thompson, Army chaplain.But when the CID and Major Mark Harvey, JAGC, discovered that they could notfit the Satanist Respondent into that fall because Respondent was not in San- 535 -Francisco, the CID and Harvey, with Adams-Thompson’s silent concurrence, createda new scenario and a new time frame.Since Respondent was on leave and in San Francisco from 3 June 1986 to 18 July1986, the CID and Harvey did this:“Further investigation shifted the time of Almond’s kidnapping from CDCfrom the fall of 1986 to June-July 1986. This change was based on the CDCrecords and the canceled checks maintained by Mrs. Adams-Thompson.”Report p. 56.Neither the CDC records nor the checks could form a basis for shifting the focusof the investigation. The records and checks just show that the child was at thedaycare center in June, July, September, and October of 1986. They are passiverecords.There is no dynamic associated with them that allows one to conclude June-Julywaspreferable to September-October.The “shift” is unsupported. The lack of support is of no moment, however,because the investigation missed critical exculpatory evidence which was readilydiscoverable by the investigators but which they chose not to pursue.The investigators were told that in the June-July period Respondent hadsubstantial work done on the interior and exterior of his home at 123 Acme, SanFrancisco, “the crime scene”, and the place where Kinsey Almond was allegedlyabused. Report at 26. Respondent delivered to the the investigators the names,addresses and telephone numbers of the artisans who worked at the home and theproperty contiguous to it, also owned by Respondent.Both the CID and Harvey, who acted in a conflicting role as both investigatorandJA to the CID, followed certain of these leads and ignored others. Those thatwerefollowed were followed only for the limited purpose of seeking inculpatoryevidence. Report P. 70, 71 and 95. No attempt was made to seek exculpatoryevidence, but such exculpatory evidence was there among the ignored.Respondent has the absolute defense of alibi for the June-July timeperiod.E. Graham Marshall was a painter in San Francisco who was hired byRespondent in the Spring of 1986 to paint first the interior and then theexterior of121 Acme and the alleged crime scene, 123 Acme, San Francisco, California. E.Graham Marshall’s affidavit is attached at Exhibit A.- 536 -Kinsey Almond was at the CDC on the following dates in June and July of 1986:June -10; July - 2, 9, 11, 17. This information comes from the checks Mrs.Adams-Thompson, Almond’s mother, wrote to the CDC. Major Harvey informed counselthat the June 10th date was the most critical because Kinsey Almond said thatcertain of her friends were with her at Respondent’s home, and June 10th was theonly date all those named friends were at the CDC with Kinsey Almond.None of the other children named by Almond - the Bailey, Fox and Quigleychildren - confirmed Almond’s story. In fact Kinsey Almond’s story remainsuncorroborated with respect to Respondent.On June 10, 1986 E. Graham Marshall, the painter from San Francisco, as was hispractice, went to Respondent’s home, the alleged crime scene, to work on theinterior. This is what happened, from Marshall’s affidavit:22. I specifically and distinctly recall being at 123 Acme on June 10, 1986.a. On June 10, 1986 I specifically recall staining cabinets in the observationroom. These cabinets were stained a dark color.b. I arrived between 7:45 and 9:00 AM as usual.c. Since June 10, 1986 was a completion day, I did not go to lunch.d. After completion of final touch-up, including cabinet and window sill work,Michael Aquino and I discussed proposals for work to be performed on theexteriors of 121 and 123 Acme.e. I did not leave the premises until after 4:00 PM.23. At no time whatsoever did I see any children enter or leave 123 Acme on June10, 1986.Marshall remembers June 10, 1986 because of the exterior contract he typed thatevening, then signed, dated, and delivered to Respondent on June 11, 1986followinghis completion day, June 10, 1986. (Exhibits II and III of the Affidavit)Marshall’s affidavit clearly states that Marshall was at Respondent’s home, thealleged crime scene, every day that Kinsey Almond was at the CDC in July. Onthispoint his Affidavit is clear - there were no children. There was no crimecommittedby Respondent.Counsel has requested the checks Mrs. Adams-Thompson wrote to the day carecenter to determine, by their amount on each date, how long Kinsey Almond was atthe day care center. The cost per hour is known, so by merely dividing the costperhour into the total amount of any given check, the number of hours on each datecould be ascertained.- 537 -This evidence is critical for the purpose of determining whether anything couldhave happened to Kinsey Almond within the time she was at the day care center. Abrief time would serve as exculpatory evidence.The CID and Major Harvey saw the checks and failed to preserve the evidenceeither by making copies or by keeping the originals. Exhibit Al.There is no evidence that the CID examined the potentially exculpatory nature ofthe checks.Now the Adams-Thompsons have refused to deliver copies of the checks to theCID. They too perhaps have discovered the exculpatory nature of the checks.This set of circumstances strongly suggests:1. A failure of basic investigatory standards by the CID and Major Harvey,2. A knowing failure to examine evidence for exculpatory implications, and3. A confirmation that the Adams-Thompson rendition of events is suspectand that their motives are other than what they have espoused to date.But this is not the end of the story. An analysis of the September-October 1986time-frame is required to better understand the motives of Captain Adams-Thompson and Mrs. Thompson, the CID, Major Harvey, JA, and LTC Hickey, M.C.,psychiatrist at the Presidio.The Respondent was in Washington, D.C. in September and October 1986 whenthe acts complained of actually were alleged to have occurred. Report at p. 26.Gary Hambright, an alleged co-conspirator, was employed by the Presidio daycare center in September of 1985. From September of 1985 through November of1986 Hambright supervised children in the three-years-and-older age group. At notime did Hambright supervise or have control over two-year-olds. See Exhibit B,which is an official government document confirming the above statements.Kinsey Almond, the alleged victim was born September 1, 1983. She became threeon September 1, 1986. From September 1, 1986 to November 1986 she wasunder Hambright’s supervision and at no other time. Further, during thisperiod Kinsey Almond was at the day care center on only four days. (See ExhibitC)The initial interviews with the Adams-Thompson family by law enforcementagencies and by LTC Deborah Hickey, a psychiatrist with the Medical Corps (seeexcerpt of FBI Hickey notes at Exhibit F) reveal conclusively that the Adams-- 538 -Thompsons stated that they noticed changes in their daughter’s behaviorbeginning in September of 1986. See Exhibits D, E and F and Report at 18.Exhibit D is the San Francisco Police Department Incident Report dated08/14/87. Attention is drawn to the upper right-hand corner of the cover sheet,where Adams-Thompson advised that the dates of occurrence were between09/01/86 and 10/31/86.Exhibit E is an FBI Report confirming the fall dates. The FBI Reports of theAdams-Thompson and Hickey interviews are critical as they were provided to theFBI in January of 1987, before Respondent was implicated by Adams-Thompson inthis matter, and are therefore the most credible evidence of alleged dates.The CID report not only fails to mention these pivotal facts, but alsointentionallyseeks to cover up these facts.Respondent was in Washington, D.C. during the September through Novemberperiod of 1986, returning to San Francisco only for one weekend during thisperiodwhen there was no chance of seeing Kinsey Almond.There is no evidence of any kind in the report that Respondent knew or had anyassociation with Hambright.Almond was under Hambright’s control only in September andOctober of 1986. Respondent was not in San Francisco during thisperiod. This clearly-exculpatory information is knowingly excluded from thereport.Major Harvey, JAGC, who wrote the report, and the CID commander who signedthe report said at page 26 of the report:The number of times that Almond received care at the CDC in the Fall of 1986 isirrelevant because LTC Aquino was out of the State of California the majority oftheFall of 1986.If this statement is true, then why does all the evidence point to the fall timeframe, and why is there no evidence that anything happened or could havehappened before September 1, 1986?The inescapable truth of the matter is that once the investigators discoveredthat an alibi defense existed for the fall of 1986, they attempted tocontort the truth, with the Adams-Thompsons’ support, to gain a resultnot supported by fact. Major Harvey writes at page 56 of the report:- 539 -Further investigation shifted the time of Almond’s kidnapping form the CDC fromthe Fall of 1986 to June-July 1986. This change was based upon the CDC recordsandthe canceled checks maintained by Mrs. Adams-Thompson.The CDC records show that Hambright was not in control of Almond in the June-July 1986 period. The checks prove nothing other than that Almond was at the daycare center.The reason for the shift is that this was the only way to implicateRespondent. The evidence does not support the “shift”.The above conclusion is supported in the following particulars:1. The Adams-Thompsons stated that Kinsey Almond had identified LilithAquino’s car on 13 August 1987 while at 123 Acme. This was of course notpossible, since the car was rented for only a few days and could not havebeen used to transport the child in 1986. This fact is disregarded by thereport. See pages 6 and 58 of the Report.2. At page 6 of the Report there is a definitive statement made that Almondidentified the Respondent’s house as the one she was taken to byHambright. The facts are that Hambright did not and could not drive due toepilepsy, and that the “identification” of the house was as follows:“Approximately 10-15 feet before coming to the front of 123 AcmeAvenue, Almond began to appear frightened and wanted to be held by hermother. Almond was picked up by her mother but continued to stare at thefront of 123 Acme Avenue.” (See page 140 of the Report)A three-year-old child is with her by-now-furious mother, “appears” to befrightened, is held by her mother in front of the Respondent’s residence,and stares right along with her mother. This is not an identification ofanything. The mother knew the address and she knew her child. Thepresence and intervention of the mother made the procedure worthless.3. During the Spring and Summer of 1986, extensive renovation was done onthe Aquinos’ house by artisans, whose names were given to the CID. TheCID did no in-depth investigation of these artisans, who were at the Aquinohouse virtually every working day in June and July of 1986. The CID knewwhen Almond was at the day care center, yet they did nothing to confirmthat workmen were crawling all over the Aquino home during the June andJuly period.- 540 -4. The report relies heavily upon a manifestly stale investigation. After theFBIand the SFPD dropped their investigations of Respondent in 1988, theArmy, under political pressure from Senator Helms, commanded a belatedinvestigation in November of 1988.The CID and Major Harvey rely upon interviews of Almond in April of 1989to substantiate the titling action. This child was three years old in 1986, andafter more than two years the CID is willing to accept what she saysabout events that occurred in 1986 as though those events happenedyesterday. Not only is her memory utterly suspect under such acircumstance, as her conflicting statements demonstrate, but also she hashad an opportunity to see pictures of Respondent and to be influenced byparents and therapists.What is telling, is found on page 8 of the report:“During the course of this investigation, no child who attended the PSFCDC and was interviewed, with the exception of Almond, identified eitherLTC or Mrs. Aquino as one of their assailants.” (paragraph 4, 7, and 8 thisreport).“During the course of this investigation, no child who was interviewedidentified 123 Acme Ave. SF, CA, from a photographic line-up, as a locationto which they had been taken (paragraph 8 and 9, this report).” (emphasisadded)5. What the report does not say, and what was supported by medicalexamination, is that Kinsey Almond was found to be a virgin. Hersupposed early statements to the therapist, LTC Hickey, to the contrary aretherefore simply untrue. Report page 26.LTC Deborah Hickey, M.C. did nothing to abate the hysteria surroundingthis incident. She apparently was the therapist for multiple numbers of theday care center children. Upon information and belief she diagnosed herown child as being sexually abused. Following that revelation she continuedto treat these children. The continuation of treatment under thatcircumstance is violative of her professional ethical standards and makesany diagnosis or conclusion on her part inherently suspect. This scenario isnot mentioned in the report.6. The Adams-Thompson story of the PX encounter between Almond andRespondent was investigated by no law enforcement agency. No attemptwas made to interview clerks or cashiers or other employees of the PX, or to- 541 -determine if others had seen the events described by Adams-Thompsonoccur. Report p. 25 and 26.There was a presumption made by law enforcement that Adams-Thompsonwas truthful without any background check to determine if he or his wifemight have a motive for singling out Respondent on religious or othergrounds. This failure is inexcusable given the seriousness of the charges.There is no doubt that Adams-Thompson knew Respondent and ofRespondent’s religious beliefs prior to the alleged encounter in August of1987. See page 215 of the Report, page 2 of Adams-Thompson’s swornstatement at Exhibit 12 of the Report.What is of note in this regard is that Almond was in therapy with LTCHickey starting in January of 1987. In June of 1987, whether through LTCHickey or Mrs. Adams-Thompson, the notion of Satanism was introducedinto the mix. See the alleged “diary” remarks at page 27 of the Report. Sixshort weeks later Adams-Thompson was telling police that the SatanistAquino was the man who his daughter identified as being a child molester.7. There is good reason to believe that the Adams-Thompson account issuspect.(a) There is no third party corroboration of anything alleged by theAdams-Thompsons or Almond.(b) Adams-Thompson has changed his story regarding who in his familywas at the PX, to include in April of 1989 his two sons, who wereused then to shore-up the PX events. Report at 25.(c) The Adams-Thompsons conveniently dropped the notion that theSeptember-October time frame was the critical time frame.(d) Mrs. Adams-Thompson’s “diary”, which was “lost”, is a suspectdocument, as there is nothing to sustain the notion that anythingwritten in the “copies” was done contemporaneously with allegedevents. Nor do references to padded rooms show anything morethan comments written after it was discovered that an upholsteredroom existed in Respondent’s home. Report at 27.(e) The Adams-Thompsons did not have their child in daily day care.Almond was dropped off and picked up at random. There was noway for Respondent to know when Almond would be at the day carecenter, or when she would be picked up. It is difficult to envision a- 542 -circumstance less conducive to the removal of this particular childfrom the day care center with any certainty that her parents wouldnot return or that her absence would go unnoticed. In fact all theday care workers denied that Hambright absented himselfwith children. See page 56 of the Report. Nor is there anycredible evidence that Respondent ever appeared at theday care center.b. That there is no evidence of False Swearing or False Statement; IntentionalNoncompliance with Art. 30, UCMJ, Maltreatment of a Subordinate, or ConductUnbecoming an Officer, and Indecent Acts.These sections of the report are little more than attempts at characterassassination of Respondent, and are further intended to inflame the reader andmask the vacuous findings of the principal charges.1. The indecent acts complained of are at 42 and 43 of the Report and relate toa religious procedure carried out by Respondent in 1970. At Page 42 MajorHarvey writes:Upon learning that Major Harvey considered the black mass “anindecent act” and “conduct unbecoming an officer” and therefore violativeof the UCMJ, LTC Aquino wrote a letter attempting to place his activitiesunder the protection of the First Amendment.Major Harvey wrote this report. This is a clear statement of bias on the partof Harvey. Yet he did not remove himself from the investigation or frombeing counsel to the investigation.None of the cases cited to support Harvey’s viewpoint has anything to dowith First Amendment Rights, and therefore all are irrelevant.If Harvey and the CID understand First Amendment freedoms, they havean extraordinary way of showing that understanding. Page after page ofquotations from Satanic literature is irrelevant. Pulling out-of-contextquotations to meet their viewpoint is unacceptable conduct by an officer ofthe court and members of law enforcement.2. Much time is spent by Harvey and the CID attacking Respondent’scredibility. Harvey becomes philosopher, psychiatrist, and moralist as heplows through this and that justification for denying that Respondent hadany credibility at all.- 543 -The Report admits at page 45 that there is no corroboration ofevidence. Instead Harvey and the CID tell us that “Aquino’s familiaritywith the widespread use by the Nazis of distortion, lies, and manipulationare factors that should not be ignored.”The truth is that LTC Michael Aquino has an exemplary record as anArmy officer, all of which is well-documented, to include high evaluationsfor integrity and ethical conduct.3. Harvey and the CID could find no negative comments from any member ofthe Armed Forces about Respondent. What they did find were threepersons with whom Respondent had been in conflict on ethical grounds,then treat their statements as truth without an examination of underlyingfactors.Seago, Blood and LaVey, all Satanists, were good enough to disproveRespondent’s credibility for Harvey and the CID. Report pp. 84, 85, 88, 89,90 and 91.The problem is that in each case Respondent provided Harvey and the CIDwith exculpatory information which was totally ignored and which showedbias on the part of each of the witnesses.Harvey and the CID were willing to treat as fact, without investigation, anynegative representation made by these three:• LaVey, as head of the Church of Satan, began commercializing theChurch by selling priesthoods. Respondent on ethical groundsdisagreed causing a schism in the church and a demise of LaVey’sinfluence.• Blood is a woman of suspect mental stability who has beenrestrained by law enforcement from harassing Respondent byphone.• Seago was removed from Respondent’s church for cause.All of this was known by Harvey and the CID and ignored or minimized.4. The report is so rambling that it is difficult to ascertain exactly whatfalseswearing was supposed to have occurred.- 544 -Apparently Respondent alleged Almond was two years old when she wasactually three. This was not material. See Report page 31.Page 30 of the Report is truly insightful. There it is suggested that a falsestatement was made when Respondent, a non-lawyer, was not clear on theform of dismissal of Hambright’s charges.Further on page 30 of the Report it is suggested that Respondent made afalse statement regarding who filed the complaint - Adams-Thompson orhis stepdaughter Almond. Again this is not material. More importantly, areview of the SFPD Incident Report shows Adams-Thompson as thereporting entity.In summary, there is not one material statement made byRespondent which remotely raises itself to the level of falseswearing - the knowing misrepresentation of a material fact.5. The interplay between Adams-Thompson and Respondent was grounded infact and not a violation of the UCMJ.Upon information and belief Adams-Thompson has filed a claim for asubstantial sum with the Army as a result of all this on behalf of Almond,his wife and himself. Money is a recognized motive in many offenses.Respondent sought vindication from Adams-Thompson because Adams-Thompson was wrong. Respondent did not threaten Adams-Thompson; hecharged him as is his right to do.The greeting card referred to at page 29 of the report was sent onSeptember 2, 1987 from San Francisco, the very date Adams-Thompsonarrived in Hawaii. A simple phone call from Adams-Thompson to a cohortin San Francisco solves the problem with the postmark on the card.The reality is further that Adams-Thompson and his wife were the primemovers in this matter. Adams-Thompson was a person reporting an allegedcrime. The SFPD Incident Report shows “Larry R. Adams-Thompson” asthe reporting entity.The truth is that Adams-Thompson’s motives have never been examined.Certainly with these investigators in charge of the investigation, thisProtestant minister who has charged a Satanist will never be investigated.- 545 -c. That Lilith Aquino is a civilian, not subject to the UCMJ, and is thereforenot aproper party for titling by the United States Army which has no jurisdictionoverLilith Aquino.This sub-topic is self-explanatory.d. That this titling action resulted from political influence brought upon theUnitedStates Army by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina.This Report was drafted without apparent regard for the consequences of closescrutiny. This results from individuals who possess either no judgment or fromindividuals who by dint of some sense of invincibility conclude that whatevertheydo has official sanction, thereby precluding the prospect of negativerepercussions.Somewhere, and most probably at the highest levels of the Army, Respondentwas declared a “Free Fire Zone”.The involvement of Senator Helms and the flurry of activity by the Armysubsequent to that involvement make both the Senator and the Army suspect.On August 1, 1988 the San Francisco District Attorney announced that no chargeswould be filed against Respondent. Prior to this time there was no active CIDinvestigation of the Respondent.On October 26, 1988 Wayne Bowles from Senator Helms’ office complained toSecretary Marsh about Respondent.The letter is reproduced here in its entirety. So offensive is this letter tothe factsof this case and to the Constitution that it should not occupy space as a mereexhibit.(Original at Exhibit G)Jesse HelmsNorth CarolinaUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510October 26, 1988The Honorable John O. Marsh, Jr.Secretary of the ArmyDear Secretary Marsh:I am writing first as a citizen of the great nation of ours and secondly as anemployee of our federal government, concerning a cancer in the military,specificallya cancer within the Army.- 546 -Last evening I viewed a program hosted by Geraldo Rivera on Satanism andWitchcraft. I was appalled to learn that a Colonel Aquino of the United StatesArmywas a founder of the Temple of Set, a satanic cult. I believe he is stationed inSt.Louis.To my view, this is disheartening. Here is a military man who has taken an oathto defend God and country who practices a religion that is completely contraryto theoath he swore to uphold. If you or any member of your staff saw this telecast Iamconfident your reaction was identical to mine.This individual should not be allowed to remain in the Army, his militaryservicerecord notwithstanding. I am respectful of any individual’s right to his firstamendment prerogatives to worship. However, I cannot believe the Constitution isintended to protect those individuals who have a belief system that espouses thekilling and sacrifice of infants and the ritual torturing of children.I would appreciate your looking into the existence of satanic worship in theArmyand it’s [sic] adherents. Perhaps it may be necessary to hold Congressionalhearingsto consider appropriate legislation in this matter.Kindest regards,Sincerely,/s/ Wayne Ronald Boyles, IIILegislative Assistant to Senator Jesse HelmsThe Army recognized that Bowles was simply a surrogate for the Senator byresponding directly to Senator Helms and bypassing Bowles in a letter ofDecember8, 1988. This letter represents a rational Constitutional standard. Exhibit H.Helms decided to keep the heat on the Army, and on January 9, 1989 wrote aletter to the Secretary of the Army.This letter is also included in its entirety, as paraphrasing does not do theletterjustice, particularly given its source. (Original at Exhibit I)Jesse HelmsNorth CarolinaUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510January 9, 1989Dear Jack:Except for two or three trips back to Washington, I’ve been working out of ourRaleigh office since the Senate adjourned in late October. Yesterday in goingthrougha stack of material sent to me in Raleigh, I ran across a December 27 clippingfromThe Washington Times about a Lt. Col. Michael Aquino who identifies himself as a“Satanist” and who claims that this is his “religion”.Either the man needs psychiatric help, or the Army doesn’t need him. The factthat he has twice appeared on national television seems to me to demonstratethathe doesn’t have all four wheels on the ground.- 547 -This is not a matter of freedom of religion. Satanism is not a religion.I tried yesterday to reach you at your home through the White Houseswitchboard, but learned that you are in Germany. When you get back, would yougive me a ring? Maybe there’s something I missed in translation, but I do notunderstand how the Army decided to “stand by” Colonel Aquino - if indeed thenewspaper account is accurate.The most charitable thing that can be said of the colonel is that he is a nut.If thatis the case, I might have some sympathy for him but I still do not believe thatheshould be “handling budgets” for the Army Reserve Personnel Center - or anywhereelse. Perhaps I am dismayed at his arrogance as much as anything else.In any event, please let me have the Army’s side of it - and I sure wouldappreciate a call from you.Sincerely,/s/ JesseThe Judge Advocate General of the Army physically met with Senator Helms todiscuss the Aquino matter in late January or early February of 1989 afterdiscussionwith the Secretary of the Army. Exhibit J.In response to Respondent’s request for letters sent to the Army by Helms, Helmssought refuge behind the Senate’s Legal Counsel. Exhibit K.By November 9, 1988 the Army was already taking action on the Helms surrogateletter. Exhibit L.On November 23, 1988 the CID began its investigation. There is no evidence thatthe CID had any interest in investigating the Respondent from August 1, 1988,thedate San Francisco publicly stated no charges would be brought, until November23,1988.The investigation did not get into full swing until March of 1989. By this timetheinvestigation was clearly stale. Respondent nonetheless cooperated fully withtheinvestigation, including allowing an interview in his home in St. Louis where heandLilith Aquino answered all questions propounded by the CID and Major Harvey,who was present for the interrogation.The Army apparently did not expect Respondent’s cooperation, as is evidenced bythe memorandum at Exhibit M.It is significant that at no time did Respondent fail to be responsive toreasonableinquiries made by the CID.- 548 -On November 29, 1988 a high-level meeting at the Pentagon was held to discussthe Aquino matter, including the following persons: TJAG, ODCSPER, DACH, PA,OCLL, M&RA, CC. Exhibit N.There can be little doubt that the Army adopted a policy of appeasement in itsdealings with Senator Helms. Respondent was expendable. The solution wastwofold, namely to deny Respondent continuation as an AGR officer and to titleRespondent without ever charging him. The way to accomplish that was to allowtheStatute of Limitations to run prior to the titling, and to use the Statute ofLimitationsas an excuse for avoiding a public trial that surely would end in an acquittal.The test for continuation as an AGR officer was merely “fully qualified”, whichRespondent was without doubt, but when the Continuation Board improperly askedif Respondent was flagged and was improperly told “yes”, due to theinvestigation,there was a basis for denial and Respondent was denied. Exhibit M.f. That Respondent was investigated in a timely fashion by the San FranciscoPoliceDepartment and the FBI, and no attempt to prosecute was made, and that the CIDinvestigation was so stale as to be tainted.A timely investigation is critical in any criminal matter both for purposes ofpreserving physical evidence as well as testimony. Both the FBI and the SFPDconducted timely investigations of Respondent. A decision was made not toprosecute.Respondent complained of the conduct of the SFPD regarding the manner inwhich the investigation was conducted and the premature declarations ofRespondent’s guilt by elements of the SFPD. The Office of Citizen Complaints oftheSan Francisco Police Commission sustained those complaints. See Exhibit 0.This demonstrates the obvious; namely, that law enforcement unchecked in anatmosphere tantamount to hysteria can go too far in attempting to ascribe guilt.That happened with the SFPD and it has happened here.g. That Respondent was titled even though the CID knew no charges werecontemplated by command and was so informed prior to the date of titling, andthat the Army knowingly allowed the Statute of Limitations to run prior totitling.This is more than passing strange. The CID had ample opportunity to finish itsinvestigation and get Respondent titled long before the Statute of Limitationsran.In a phone conversation with Major Harvey, Counsel for Respondent learned thatthe Army had decided not to charge Respondent before the titling action- 549 -was completed. Assuming the accuracy of Major Harvey’s representation, whythen proceed with a titling action?There is only one available answer and that lies in the interplay between theArmy and Senator Helms. The titling action for such heinous crimes effectivelydestroys Respondent’s career and labels him for life. Helms is satisfied.By knowingly allowing the Statute to run, there is an excuse for no prosecution,and no chance for Respondent’s vindication in a public forum.Knowing that the matter would not be prosecuted gave Harvey and the CIDlicense to say or conclude whatever they wished.Further license was provided by the very nature of the case - “a Satanistaccusedof child abuse”. Who would not be repelled by the mere thought of such acircumstance? The answer is simple - those who understand and believe both inthepresumption of innocence and in the Constitution of the United States.- 550 -Appendix 63: Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and DamagesUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of VirginiaAlexandria DivisionMichael A.

AquinoPrior to the filing of briefs, plaintiff was permitted to submit 26 writtenquestions to defendant. While the judge was able to see and consider thesequestions and answers when deciding the case, he was not able to see anycritique or rebuttal of the CID’s written answers.I originally wrote the critique below for my attorney, on the possibility thathe might have some opportunity to introduce it to the court. He did not.This entire set of CID responses is filled with “it’s possible that”, “it’sconceivable that”, “may have been”, etc. Having no facts or even probabilitiesatall to work with, the CID tries to justify “probable cause” on the basis ofpossibilities alone - and most of these are so remote and/or so inconsistentwith established fact as to be incredible.The responses also cite only those statements by Kinsey and Michele whichare accusatory in the latest version of the CID’s “scenario”. All of the manyinconsistent and unsupportive statements by both of these two individuals areignored as though they didn’t exist.The critique is here formatted as “footnotes” to the CID’s answers.QUESTION ONEMyers QuestionPlease describe how CDC records and canceled checks maintained by Mrs. Adams-Thompson shifted the time of Almond’s kidnapping from the CDC from the fall of1986to June-July 1986. As part of your response, describe all evidence which causedthe fallof 1986 to be the initial focus of the investigation, why such evidence wasultimatelydisregarded, and how plaintiff was linked to CDC records and Mrs.Adams-Thompson’scanceled checks by the CDC.CID ResponseThe joint investigation of Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Aquino by the SanFranciscoPolice Department (hereinafter “SFPD”) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation- 554 -(hereinafter “FBI”) was monitored and assisted by the San Francisco FieldOffice,United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (hereinafter “CID”). 222This activity is documented under CID sequence number 0499-87-CID026 (SeeBasis for Investigation, page 4, Report of Investigation Number 0610-88-CID026-69259). [Hereinafter CID Report of Investigation 0610-88-CID026-69259titling LTC Aquino will be referred to as “CID Aquino ROI”.]223The SFPD prepared Report Number 870910025 (hereinafter “SFPD Aquino ROI”),which documented the FBI and SFPD conclusion that Kinsey Adams-Thompson wassexually molested by LTC Michael A. Aquino, Mrs. Lilith Aquino, and Mr. Gary W.Hambright during 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM, Monday-Friday, between September 1, 1986and October 31, 1986 (SFPD Aquino ROI at top of pages 1 and 2). [A copy of theSFPDAquino ROI is Attachment A to Exhibit 5 (sworn statement of LTC Aquino dated 4Jan1988) of the CID Aquino ROI. ]224222 False statement. The CID began its investigation on 11/23/88, at which timeit followed therequired official procedures of notifying me, notifying my commander to suspendactions on (“flag”)my personnel file, and notifying the Army Intelligence & Security Command tosuspend my securityclearance.After 11/23/88 CID investigators Penaluna and Harvey complained to my Armyattorney CaptainHayes that “they had nothing”, that “the FBI files were closed to them”, andthat “they had to startfrom scratch”. Hence the 100%-ignorant nature of Harvey’s list of questionsinitially submitted to mein January 1988. Later on, when Cates was added to the CID team, he said toHayes that “previousinvestigations were not important; he would conduct this one from scratch”.No official from either the FBI or the SFPD has ever made any reference whateverto any such“monitoring and assistance”.This response by the CID is clearly intended to support the fiction that the CIDinvestigation wasnot a Helms-driven political scheme commencing November 1988.]223 Only one document bearing CID sequence number “0499-87-CID026” appears inthe CID ROI.This is Agent Potter’s 1/2-page report of the “123 Acme identification” trip on8/13/87 (ROI Exhibit#E-1). This report states that it was made “in conjunction with” an 8/13/87 FBIinterview of KinseyAlmond, and makes no reference to any CID actions. [The FBI 8/13/87 interviewalso makes noreference to any CID actions.]CID attorney Captain Harvey’s 10/17/88 letter (ROI Exhibit #G-3) makes noreference to any CIDsequence number, nor to any pre-11/23/88 investigation, monitoring, orassistance of any sort by theCID.224 The SFPD document referred to is an incident report (i.e. a report of acomplaint), not a “reportof investigation” [by the SFPD officer recording the complaint]. This SFPDincident report stated no“FBI and SFPD conclusion” concerning the truth of Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s (theinterviewee)allegations.- 555 -The SFPD Aquino ROI was based upon FBI interviews, which are discussed in detailin the SFPD Aquino ROI and pages 18-19, 24-27, 58-59, paragraphs 2.2.1, 2.2.3,4.1CID Aquino ROI. 225The initial date of incident was based on Mrs. Adams-Thompson’s comment thatKinsey had wet herself at the Child Development Center (CDC) and began to havenightmares in the fall of 1986. 226Kinsey also made derogatory comments about Gary Hambright in the fall of 1986(page 18, CID Aquino ROI). 227Mrs. Adams-Thompson made her statements to the FBI in August 1987, and herrecollection of the timing of Kinsey’s nightmares or wetting her panties mayhave beenincorrect. 228225 The SFPD incident report does not identify, quote from, nor include asattachments any FBIinterviews. The story that Chaplain Adams-Thompson alleges to the SFPD isinconsistent with all FBIinterviews concerning Kinsey Almond.The CID ROI “discussion” of the FBI interviews distorts, excuses, andembellishes their actualcontents to conform to the agenda of the ROI author. Consequently these“discussions” are relevantonly to the CID bias and agenda, and are not reliable as summaries of the actualFBI reports.226 The initial date-window of Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s fabricated allegationswas restricted to9/1-10/31/86, because that was the only period when Kinsey was under Hambright’ssupervision atthe CDC.Omitted from the CID ROI, and kept secret from my attorneys and myself until wediscoveredthem independently, were FBI interviews of Lawrence, Michele, and KinseyAdams-Thompson on1/14-15/87.In her 1/14/87 FBI interview - two months past the accusation date-window -Michele made theretroactive “wetting” and “nightmares” comments. Significantly the A-Ts did notregister or reportany concern about any aspect of Kinsey’s behavior during or prior to the9/1-10/31/86 window. Bythe time of this 1/14/87 interview the “abuse” witch-hunt against Hambright,encouraged by the A-Ts[as one of the five activist parents circularizing others at the Presidio topromote the witchhunt] wasfully underway. Michele’s “sudden recall” of “bedwetting/ nightmares” is thusnon-credible.On 2/19/87 the FBI interviewed the therapist Debbie Hickey, who was alsospecific about the9/1-10/31/86 window.On 4/23/87 Hickey provided a sworn affidavit in which she states that the twoadult A-Ts werespecific about the 9/1-10/31/86 window to her when she interviewed them on1/13/87.227 False statement. What appears on page #18 of the CID ROI is the ROI author’scomment thatKinsey told her mother that she “did not like Mr. Gary”, which is only anallegation from Michele inher 1/14/87 FBI interview. When Kinsey herself was interviewed by the FBI on1/15/87, she made noderogatory comments about Hambright at all.228 Michele A-T’s statement about Almond’s “nightmares and wetting” was made inher 1/14/87 FBIinterview - just two months after the accusation window. By falsifying theorigin of the statement to8/87, the CID attempts to manufacture “evidence” of a “blurred accusationwindow” in violation ofthe law.- 556 -Another explanation is that a psychological reaction to the sexual assaults isnotuncommon. 229The August 13 and 14, 1987 FBI interviews of the Adams-Thompsons wereconsidered highly reliable in regard to Kinsey’s identification of LTC Aquino atthe postexchange and the subsequent identification of the Aquino residence (pages 26-27,CIDAquino ROI). 230The identification of Mrs. Aquino as “Shamby” was less reliable because thisidentification was “suggestive” because of her proximity to LTC Aquino when theidentification was made. 231Once a determination had been made that the identification was reliable, it wasimportant to determine when LTC Aquino and Gary Hambright were in SanFrancisco. 232229 There is no record whatever of any “psychological reaction to a sexualassault” by Almond eitherprior to or during the 9-10/86 accusation window. There is no evidence of anysexual assault onAlmond, period. There is only the say-so of “therapist” Hickey in her 2/18/87FBI interview, whichHickey justified by comments about her 2/3/87 session with Almond which are notaccurately takenfrom her actual notes of that session.230 Throughout the CID investigation I provided the CID with increasingdocumentation as to justhow unreliable the 8/13-14/87 interviews of the A-Ts actually were. See “A-T’sViolations of #133UCMJ” (originally provided to the CID on 5/10/89) for numerous inconsistencies,prop-up-revisions,and obvious falsifications - including no evidence that Almond was even at thePX or behaved thereas the A-Ts alleged, and including the fact that Almond made no “identification”of our residence atall.231 Again there is only the allegation by the A-Ts that Almond made any such“identification”, andabundant evidence that this was simply one more A-T lie. Nor after the A-Tallegations did Almondever pick out Lilith from any photo/video-lineup. The A-Ts are 100% inconsistentas to when anyonesaw Lilith anywhere [see “A-T’s Violations of #133 UCMJ”].“Proximity to me”: Michele specified in her 4/10/89 CID statement that Lilithwas standing nextto our rented car “alone” when they first saw her and Almond made her alleged“identification” ofher.Moreover, as Lilith and I had been constantly together in the PX, why wouldn’tAlmond have“IDd” her at the same time as she “did” me?232 As noted, the CID knew that the “identification” was anything but reliable.The CID now says that its next step was to try to find a date when bothHambright and myselfwere in San Francisco. This is a reversal of appropriate investigativeprocedure, which would be tosee whether I could be placed in the same precise location - not just “city”! -as Almond duringthe accusation window (the only period when Hambright had any control overAlmond).In short, the CID not only created a nonexistent “crime” but [repeatedly] movedits date [andlocation] around to try to escape the valid alibis which kept proving ourinnocence.- 557 -If it could be established that LTC Aquino, Kinsey Adams-Thompson, and GaryHambright were not together, then the allegation would be unfounded. 233Accordingly it was important to establish the dates when Kinsey received care atthePresidio CDC. 234Ultimately LTC Aquino admitted in a sworn statement that he was in San Franciscothroughout June-July 1986 (pages 56-57, CID Aquino ROI). 235Employment records at the Presidio CDC established that Gary Hambright was atthe CDC throughout June-July 1986. 236Mrs. Adams-Thompson paid for daycare for Kinsey by check, establishing thatKinsey received daycare during April-July 1986.237This shift in dates for the occurrence of the offense is discussed at paragraph2.8.2,pages 56-57, CID Aquino ROI. 238QUESTION TWOMyers QuestionPlease describe what steps were taken by defendant to verify or discredit thealibiprovided by E. Graham Marshall, the painter, who provided an affidavit.233 It was indeed “established that LTC Aquino, Kinsey Adams-Thompson, and GaryHambright werenot together” during both the accusation window and the CID-attempted re-datingand re-locating.Therefor the A-Ts’ allegations were unfounded, and, as evident from theirdeliberate lies toinvestigators, intentionally and maliciously fabricated. [See “A-T’s Violationsof #133 UCMJ”.]234 The dates when Almond was under any supervision by Hambright whatever wereestablished fromthe A-Ts’ checks. An immediate comparison of those check dates to Lilith’s andmy verified location inWashington, D.C. on the same dates would have proved our innocence immediatelyandabsolutely. Instead the CID did not even bother with obtaining the checks untillate in itsinvestigation, and long after it had set in motion harmful acts against me (suchas fixing of the AGRcontinuation board). In short, proof of our innocence was never of the leastinterest to the CID.235 I did not “admit”; I stated - as was of course routine information from myassignment, leave, andfinancial records. Here again the CID is working on its falsified “back-dating”to a period manymonths prior to the 9-10/86 accusation window.236 However the CID also knew that Hambright had no supervision of Almond untilSeptember 1986,so his merely being at the CDC before then is irrelevant.237 As Hambright had no supervision of Almond until September 1986, MicheleA-T’s checks to theCDC before then are irrelevant.238 Paragraph 2.8.2 of the ROI simply repeats the above: that, upon finding thatLilith and I were onthe other side of the U.S.A. on all possible dates during the 9-10/86 accusationwindow, the CID thenmanufactured a new date months earlier, based on nothing more than determiningwhen I had beenin San Francisco. Such “manufacture of evidence” is a violation of law.- 558 -CID ResponseOn March 27, 1990 Major Mark W. Harvey, Region Judge Advocate, Sixth Region,CID, Presidio of San Francisco, CA 94139 telephonically interviewed E. GrahamMarshall. With the consent of Mr. Marshall, the interview was tape-recorded.Mr. Marshall indicated that LTC Aquino could have brought a child into the largefront room of Mr. Butch’s apartment, on the lower level of 123 Acme, without Mr.Marshall being aware of it (pages 6-7, Marshall interview).In 1986 Mr. William T. Butch, a member of the Temple of Set and LTC Aquino’sbrother-in-law, moved into the street-level apartment at 123 Acme. LTC AquinoownedMr. Butch’s apartment. LTC Aquino and Mrs. Aquino had lived in the street-levelapartment at 123 Acme before LTC Aquino’s mother passed away (para. 8.17, CIDAquino ROI). After LTC Aquino’s mother’s death, LTC and Mrs. Aquino movedupstairs into his mother’s residence, and Mr. Butch moved into the street-levelapartment at 123 Acme. The police never searched Mr. Butch’s apartment, and nopictures of Mr. Butch’s apartment were shown to any children. According to LTCAquino, the Butch apartment was used for one Temple of Set ritual, theordination of aTemple of Set priest (middle of page 71, CID Aquino ROI). 239During Kinsey Adams-Thompson’s Monday, May 15, 1989 interview, Kinseyrepeated her earlier assertion that she was taken to a room with soft walls.However239 That ordination tool place in June of 1986, at just the time the CID’s1991-invented scenarioproposes the Butch apartment might have been “the place”. At the beginning ofthe CID investigation,I gave Butch’s name and occupancy of that apartment to Harvey (in response tohis writtenquestions), and when the question of the ritual came up I also gave them thename of the Priest whowas ordained - Mitchell Wade of Berkeley, CA (now dead of illness). Wade told methat Penalunatelephoned him and asked him what kind of bathtub the apartment had, and nothingelse. No oneinterviewed Wade in person or asked him anything else about the apartment.And of course neither the CID not anyone else ever interviewed Bill Butch on thedecor of hisapartment or anything else. He had been living in that lower apartment sinceJanuary of 1986,together with Lilith’s son Christopher Wise (whom nobody interviewed either).- 559 -Kinsey contended that the room with padded walls on the top of 123 Acme was thecorrect room. 240Kinsey described the walls as being like blankets on a bed (of a rougher fabrictype). 241The draping of walls is recommended by LTC Aquino in his writings, and an oldphotograph seized by the FBI during the search of the Aquino residence shows aceremony, ritual, or play in which a draped room is used by the Aquinos. 242This interview is discussed at paragraph 2.2.3, page 27, and Exhibit 45, CIDAquinoROI. 243240 No 5/15/89 interview of Almond ever took place. (ROI 4.1).A CID interview of Almond did take place on 5/11/89. In violation of Discovery,neither atranscript nor a taped copy of this interview was provided to Plaintiff by theCID. Nor is a verbatimtranscript of this interview included in the CID ROI. At Exhibit 45 is onlyHarvey’s memorandumalleging what Almond said.In this Harvey memorandum Almond rejects what was apparently a photograph of thevinyl-walled wetbar on the 123 roof that Harvey showed to her (from the 8/14/87 FBIphotos taken duringthe search warrant). Therefore the CID’s response here that Almond “contendedthat the room withthe padded walls on the top of 123 Acme was the correct room” is a lie.Almond never made any “earlier assertion” that she was taken to a room with softwalls. There isno mention of this, or anything like it, in (a) her 1/26/87 FBI interview, (b)her 8/13/87 FBIinterview, (c) any of the 1/27-8/10/87 Hickey “therapy” sessions, or (d) the10/15/87 FBI interview.Nor did either of the A-Ts allege a “room with soft walls” at any time prior totheir learning ofthe actual appearance of our home following the search warrant and itsphotographs.After seeing the photographs on 10/15/87, Michele A-T sent a photocopy of herdiary to MajorHarvey of the CID.(ROI Ex.13). In the margin of the 6/30/87 entry, and clearlynot part of theoriginal entry, is “At bed: Gary had ‘soft walls’ mommy ... she’s confused”.(ROI Ex. 42). Here isevidence of Michele’s deliberate attempt to manufacture “evidence”.In her 4/10/89 CID interview Michele A-T said that after photocopying her diaryfor Harvey, she“either misfiled or threw away the original”. This is not sensible, because theoriginal would obviouslybe important as evidence. It makes sense only if Michele had added themarginalia or othercomments after the dates indicated, and feared that laboratory analysis wouldreveal this. No suchanalysis is possible with a photocopy.241 Again, the CID illegally concealed any verbatim transcript of what Almondsaid in her 5/11/89interview. Harvey’s interpretation (ROI Ex.45) says only “a cloth-likesubstance” and makes nomention of “like blankets on a bed (of a rougher fabric type)”.242 The specific photograph is neither included in the CID ROI as any kind of“evidence”, norotherwise identified. However the plaster and fiberboard walls in our residencecould not hold heavyhangings, such as blankets, without damage. Accordingly we have never used suchhangings for anytemporary purpose here, as examination of the walls would easily verify. The CIDmade no attempt orrequest to examine any walls in 123 for signs of such hangings as they allegehere. Had they done so,they would have found no high-up holes in the original 1930-vintage plaster atall.243 As detailed above, this Almond interview is differently described in thisResponse, in the ROInarrative at 2.2.3, and in Harvey’s memorandum at ROI Ex.45. A verbatimtranscript or tape wasconcealed or destroyed.- 560 -The large living room of Mr. Butch’s apartment on the street level of 123 Acmeis themost logical location for Gary Hambright and LTC Aquino to have committed thesexual assault of Kinsey Adams-Thompson. 244This room could have been draped with blankets, and Kinsey would not haverecognized any of the building’s interior contents. 245Based on the interviews of Mr. West (paragraph 8.17, CID Aquino ROI), Mr.Marshall, LTC Aquino (paragraph 6.1, CID Aquino ROI), and Kinsey Adams-Thompson, the CID determined that the apartment on the upper level of 123 Acmewasprobably not the apartment where the sexual offenses occurred. If the sexualoffensesdid occur in the upper apartment of 123 Acme, the FBI photographs taken inAugust1987 were of little use because such significant redecoration had occurredbetween the244 If this room is so “logical”, why was no investigative attention paid to itat all by the SFPD, theFBI, or the CID prior to Graham Marshall’s affidavit exonerating our own flat asany possible “crimescene”? Prior to Marshall’s statement, the CID maintained adamantly andexclusively that the alleged“crime” had been committed there, even to the extent of trying to manufactureevidence such asstatuary being there when it had not been (ROI P. 72-73) and transform Almond’soriginal 8/13/87FBI interview statement about “a bathtub with lion’s feet” into “any pictures oflions” (CID question#5, M. Aquino sworn statement 1/27/89).Nor did the SFPD, FBI, or CID ever attempt to interview William Butch. Howeveron 4/4/91 Butchprovided a sworn affidavit that he would have been home in the daytime on6/10/86 because of hiswork schedule, that his apartment did not have padded or draped walls, and thathe never saw anychildren in the apartment. (Appeals Exhibits P. 258-9).And, as shall be repeated every time the CID or anyone else insinuates to thecontrary, there is noevidence whatever that Hambright, Lilith, or I ever sexually assaulted Almondanywhere, anytime. Note also Almond’s medical examination of 3/12/87 - a brieftime after the9-10/86 accusation window - verifying her to be a virgin with no signs of anysexual abuse whatever(ROI Ex.18).245 An examination of the front room of Butch’s apartment, had the CIDconsidered its suggestionserious enough to even request it [which it obviously did not], would haverevealed the original,unbroken plaster around the tops of all walls in the room - indeed throughoutthe entire apartment.Also in his 4/4/91 sworn affidavit, Butch stated that his apartment did not havepadded or drapedwalls. (Appeals Exhibits P. 258-9).During the search warrant execution not a single “black blanket” or “black wallhanging” appeared,either on or off any wall, as is evident from the photographs - since thecontents of all of our closetsand drawers were strewn out into the open for the photographing.The Temple of Set’s ceremonies can be, and are, conducted in surroundings of anycolor - not justblack. If asked, we could produce hundreds of members who have attendedceremonies in either thedownstairs or the upstairs flat with their perfectly normal tan walls. I haveplenty of photos of otherChurch of Satan & Temple of Set ceremonial rooms showing non-black walls,including my ownprevious residences.- 561 -alleged time of the offenses (summer 1986) and the time of the photographs(August1987). 246QUESTION THREEMyers QuestionPlease state the dates and times on those respective days that Kinsey Almond wasatthe CDC during the June-July 1986 time-period. Does the defendant possess copiesofor original checks written by the Adams-Thompsons to the Presidio CDC for theabovetime period for the care of Kinsey Almond? Did the defendant ever see or possesssuchchecks? Why does the defendant not now possess such checks or copies of suchchecks?CID ResponseIn April 1987 [sic. - should be 1989] the checks were shown to Special Agent DanCates, who noted the respective days that Kinsey was at the CDC duringApril-August1986, but did not retain copies of the checks. 247Defendant does not now possess copies or the original checks written by theAdams-Thompsons to the Presidio CDC for the above time-period for the care of Kinsey.TheAdams-Thompsons have declined to provide copies of such checks. If copies of thechecks are obtained from the Adams-Thompsons, they will be provided toplaintiff. 248246 As shall be repeated every time the CID or anyone else insinuates to thecontrary, there is noevidence whatever that Hambright, Lilith, or I ever sexually assaulted Almondanywhere, anytime.“If the sexual offenses occurred in the upper apartment, the FBI photos taken inAugust 1987 wereof little use ...” Then why did the CID try so strenuously for so long to allegethat Almond “identified”anything from them - which of course she did not in the 10/29/87 FBI interviewof her?“The alleged time of the offenses” was not “summer 1986”, but September1-October 31, 1986- determined by the only timespan when Hambright had Almond under hissupervision at the CDC.The “summer 1986” re-date was simply an arbitrary maneuver by the CID tomanufacture “evidence”and obstruct justice in violation of the law. [See notes to Response #1.]247 This indicates that as of April 1989 the CID knew that the only possibleaccusation window of9-10/86 was absolute proof of our innocence, hence they discarded it entirely intheir agenda toframe us. [Cates didn’t show any interest in checks pertinent to the accusationwindow.]248 Copies of the checks were obtained 4/8/91 (ROI Exhibit G1). They verify thatLilith and I were inWashington, D.C. on all dates during 9-10/86 when Almond was at the CDC underHambright’scontrol or supervision, hence are additional absolute proof of our innocence.Presumably this is whythe A-Ts refused so long to provide them.As Almond was not under Hambright’s control or supervision during any time otherthan 9-10/86,the check dates/amounts outside that accusation window are irrelevant - exceptto show how the CIDwent about picking a three-months-prior date for their 1989 “revision” agenda.- 562 -QUESTION FOURMyers QuestionPlease describe all evidence linking Plaintiff to Mr. Gary Hambright.CID ResponseKinsey Adams-Thompson said that she was sexually molested by both GaryHambright and LTC Aquino. 249Kinsey Adams-Thompson identified Gary Hambright from a photographic lineup(paragraph 9.19, CID Aquino ROI). 250On April 7-8, 1989 Kinsey Adams-Thompson identified LTC Aquino as the “Mike” or“Mikey” that had sexually assaulted her with Gary Hambright (paragraph 9.19, CIDAquino ROI). 251249 While after being repeatedly coerced by Hickey Almond recited Hickey’sindoctrination thatHambright molested her, Almond never recited that she was sexually molested byme in anyinterview transcript included in the ROI and provided under Discovery. Harvey’s“interpretations” ofher 1989 interview are noncredible in view of Harvey’s bias, agenda, andfrequent lying throughoutthe investigation.250 Almond’s identification of Hambright is not surprising, since she was in hisclass during the9-10/86 period, and since her parents, Hickey, and investigators kept focusingher on him constantlythereafter.251 As this 4/89 interview occurred after two years of her parents and a seriesof SFPD, FBI, and CIDinvestigators pushing videos and photos of Lilith and myself on this child, herpicking out my face in4/89 is hardly surprising. Nor, for the same reason, does it prove anything atall.What is relevant is that prior to her mother Michele’s introduction ofdescriptions of me (whomshe and her husband knew from my Presidio assignment) into Hickey’s 6/30/87session, Almondnever mentioned any “Mikey” whatever, and never recited the name “Mike”.When Almond had started to recite “Mikey” after 6/30/87, there is no evidencewhatever that sheherself associated the name with me. There were only her parents’ allegations intheir plannedscheme, and then two years of their obviously pushing Almond to echo thisallegation. If she actuallydid so two years later in 1989, the CID was sufficiently disappointed in herperformance not to includeany direct quotation from her in the ROI to this effect, and to conceal either atranscript or a tapefrom me in this lawsuit.- 563 -On May 21, 1989 Steven L. Quigley told USACIDC that he observed LTC Aquino inthe Child Development Center (CDC) on two occasions (paragraph 7.17, CID AquinoROI). 252Gary Hambright worked at the CDC. LTC Aquino had no known reason for being atthe CDC. LTC Aquino repeatedly denied under oath that he had ever been in theCDC.253QUESTION FIVEMyers QuestionPlease describe all evidence which points to plaintiff acting in concert withanyperson, and name those persons.252 By May 1989 the A-T allegations had long been an international media circus,and anyone with aninterest in promoting the Presidio “abuse” scam could allege anything. What isrelevant is that there isno record of Quigley making any reference to me, or anyone resembling me, beforethe mediapublicity.Neither a transcript nor a tape of any statement whatever by Quigley wasprovided in the CID ROIunder Discovery, in violation of law. If Quigley said he had seen me at the CDC,he simply told a lie, asI have never been there at any time.What is known about Quigley is that according to a 6/23/88 list of claimsagainst the CDC foralleged abuse, the Quigley family had filed for a total of $4.5 million inclaims. So it obviously had asubstantial vested interest in promoting anything supporting the Presidio“abuse” scenario. The CIDomits this motive and bias of the Quigleys from the ROI or this Response, ofcourse.In the referenced para 7.17 of the ROI, Quigley is described as saying that“Mikey” was not inuniform at the CDC. Almond, on the other hand, recited her mother’s story that“Mikey” wore anArmy officer’s uniform. Obviously either Quigley or Almond is noncredible as a“witness” accordingly.Nor did Almond herself, in any of her coached recitals of allegations, everallege that I had been tothe CDC. [The A-T story was that Lilith and I had been at our home, and thatHambright had drivenAlmond there.] Another contradiction between the A-T and Quigley versions.And - conspicuous by its absence: There were obviously a great many children andseveral teachersat the CDC - none of whom ever referred to anyone identifiable as Lilith ormyself before the A-Tpublicity. Thereafter the CID could get only one of the children - Quigley - tocooperate with them in a3-year-stale “remembered identification”!253 I have indeed never been to the CDC, and until the attack on Lilith andmyself, did not even knowwhere it was located on the Presidio.As indeed I have repeatedly sworn under oath, I never knew nor had anyassociation or contactwith Hambright at all.On July 14, 1989 Gary Hambright provided the following handwritten statement viahis attorneys:“To whom it may concern, I, Gary Willard Hambright, have never seen or metMichael A. Aquino atthe Presidio Day Care Center or anywhere else. He, Aquino, has never taken anychild, to myknowledge, from the Presidio Day Care Center nor did I take children to hishome.”- 564 -CID ResponseFrom January to August 1987, Kinsey Adams-Thompson told LTC Deborah Hickeythat she was sexually molested by “Mr. Gary” or “Gary” (Gary Hambright), 254“Mikey”or “Mike” (LTC Aquino), 255 and “Shamby” or “Todo” or “Sassy” (Mrs. Aquino).256Sometimes Kinsey related that other persons were at the house where she wasmolested (pages 20-24, CID Aquino ROI). 257The only person known by name that there is probable cause to believe acted inconcert with LTC Aquino is Mr. Gary Hambright. 258On August 13, 1987 Captain and Mrs. Adams-Thompson told Special Agent Foremanthat they observed Kinsey Adams-Thompson’s identification of LTC Aquino as the“Mikey” that had sexually molested her, and identified Mrs. Aquino as “Shamby”,another person that had sexually molested her. 259Other evidence is described in pages 24-27, 58-61, 100-101, CID Aquino ROI; Stmtof Mrs. Adams-Thompson, CID Aquino ROI; pages 2-3, SFPD ROI. 260254 False. See transcript and analysis of Hickey notes.255 False. See transcript and analysis of Hickey notes. Note here the CID’s ownunsubstantiatedassociation of “Mikey” or “Mike” with my name.256 False. See transcript and analysis of Hickey notes. Note here the CID’s ownunsubstantiatedassociation of “Shamby”, “Sassy”, or “Todo” with Lilith’s name. “Todo” appearson a completelyunconnected list of persons who telephoned concerning an apartment we hadavailable.257 This is not evidence of anything whatever concerning Lilith and myself.258 There is in fact no probable cause to associate Hambright with Lilith andmyself in any way - saveas coincidental victims of the Presidio “abuse” witch hunt.259 A deliberately false allegation by the A-Ts. See “A-T’s Violations ofArticle #133”, Section #C.260 The PX encounter on pages 24-27 is exposed in “A-T’s Violations of Article#133”, Section #C. ThePX encounter is exposed as indicated, and the two-years-later Almond CIDinterview is meaninglessbecause of conditioning and contamination of Almond. Pages 100-101 cite atwo-years-later photolineup shown to Almond, in which her by-then-unsurprising notice of me is evenmore contradictedby her non-“recognition” of a photo of our home and her “identification of afemale (who is not asuspect) as ‘Shamby’”.All statements by Michele A-T - who has been caught in innumerable lies, and whohas a clearlyvested interest in not being convicted of felonies for false statements tolaw-enforcement officers andmaking false monetary claims against the government - are evidence of nothingexcept her ownmotives and actions in furtherance of them.Concerning the SFPD Incident Report (again misrepresented by the CID here as a“ROI”), seeannotations #3 & #4 to Response One. The SFPD report is simply a record of whatLawrence A-Talleged to the interviewing officer.- 565 -Other children stated that they departed the CDC with Mr. Hambright to go toanother location where bizarre sexual and nonsexual activities occurred. 261Other children stated that other adults, apparently not employed at the PresidioCDC, took them to the Aquino residence or the residence of other adults andsexuallymolested these children. 262Some of these statements are partially consistent with going to the residence ofLTCand Mrs. Aquino. 263Some of the children related that the adults in the residence wore masks andcostumes. 264Some of the children related that when they saw LTC Aquino on television, theyremembered that LTC Aquino was at the residence where they saw the adults incostumes. 265For a variety of reasons the CID determined that these children’s descriptionswerenot sufficiently credible to formally list these children as the victims ofcrimescommitted by LTC and Mrs. Aquino. 266261 While this statement has no relevance to Lilith or myself, based on allpublished information todate concerning the Hambright allegations, there is no evidence that he eversexually abused any childat the CDC or elsewhere.262 The CID ROI includes no such allegations which predate the A-T allegationspublicity. The CIDROI indicates that all such post-A-T allegations were originallyalleged-to-be-hearsay by parents withan emotional, financial, and/or publicity stake in either the Presidio or other“child abuse”witchhunts.263 No such “consistencies” predate previous media, parental networking, orinvestigator exposure ofthe information, and none whatever predates the A-T allegations publicity.264 The theme of “adults wearing masks and costumes” was a standard feature of1980s’ “SatanicRitual Abuse” scams from McMartin onward, and was routinely advertised by both“therapists” and“cult cops” who promoted such scams.265 Rather the parents of children previously used in either the Presidio orother “abuse” scamsalleged such statements by their children. Again, not a single such allegationpredates the A-Tpublicity.266 As the ROI indicates, such aspects of the children’s supposed allegations ascould be checkedresulted in nothing but lies, nonexistent locations, and other invalidations ofthe children’s [and theirmanipulating parents’] credibility.Accordingly for the CID to invoke the names and/or stories of suchchildren/parents in the ROI as“evidence” of anything is unjustified, and as such a deliberate attempt by theCID to manufacture“evidence” in violation of law.- 566 -In order to protect the privacy of these other adults and children, neithertheirnames nor the incidents discussed in the CID Aquino ROI are further discussed.267The CID did not determine that there was probable cause to believe that theseotheradults acted in concert with LTC Aquino and Mr. Gary Hambright. 268For example, one of the children, we will call her Angela, testified that herbaby-sitter and a friend sexually molested her. After Angela’s baby-sitter wasconvicted ofchild sexual abuse and sentenced to twenty years confinement, Angela allegedthat LTCand Mrs. Aquino acted in concert with the convicted child molesters. 269CID developed sufficient evidence to show that Angela’s allegations against LTCandMrs. Aquino lacked probable cause. 270Several children in Northern California made similar allegations against theAquinos. These allegations were also unsubstantiated. 271QUESTION SIXMyers QuestionPlease provide the names, addresses, phone numbers, and ages of all personsdeemed by Defendant through the CID to be victims of Plaintiff. The agerequested isthe age at the date of contact with Plaintiff.267 The names of all the children and their parents were provided in theuncensored ROI providedduring Discovery. What this revealed was that all of the parents/children namedwere principallyinvolved in either the Presidio or previous “abuse” scams, with massivefinancial claims, publicity-mongering, etc. The CID’s original concealment of their names was actually toconceal thisdiscrediting of them as objective, uninvolved information sources.268 In fact what an examination of the “other adults” revealed was that they hadnot the slightestconnection with Hambright or myself. Nor, as the CID knows, is there anyevidence that Hambrightand I even knew each other, much less “acted in concert”.269 From the uncensored ROI this is the pre-Presidio case of AngeliqueJefferson. What the CID omitsto mention here is that Jefferson’s babysitter and friend maintained theirinnocence of Jefferson’smother’s allegations, but plea-bargained out of fear of prosecutorial threats.When the CIDinterviewed them in prison, they both continued to deny ever having molestedanyone. The samemother’s invention of allegations against Lilith and myself came after the A-Tpublicity, was notsubstantiated by anything in the previous Jefferson case, and was disproved byabundantimpossibilities in the mother’s attempted fabrications.270 Accordingly for the CID to invoke the names and/or stories of suchchildren/parents in the ROI as“evidence” of anything is unjustified, and as such a deliberate attempt by theCID to manufacture“evidence” in violation of law.271 Accordingly for the CID to invoke the names and/or stories of suchchildren/parents in the ROI as“evidence” of anything is unjustified, and as such a deliberate attempt by theCID to manufacture“evidence” in violation of law.- 567 -CID ResponseThe “victim block” of the CID Aquino ROI lists the only victim established bytheprobable cause evidentiary standard, which is used as the reporting standard bytheCID. The listed victim is Kinsey Marie Almond Adams-Thompson, dependentstepdaughter of Captain Larry Parker Adams-Thompson. Kinsey’s date of birth isSeptember 1, 1983. When the offenses occurred between September 1, 1985 andSeptember 1, 1986, Kinsey was between 2 and 3 years old. 272There were children who alleged in interviews with the SFPD, FBI, CID, andmedicalpersonnel working at the Letterman Army Medical Center that they were sexuallyabused while away from the Presidio Child Development Center (CDC). 273The focus of the CID Aquino ROI was on allegations relating to offenses outsidetheCDC that were committed by either LTC Aquino or Mr. Gary Hambright or both.However none of the other children’s information was considered by the CID to besufficiently reliable to meet the probable cause standard. Accordingly the otherchildren interviewed were not listed in the “victim block” of the CID AquinoROI. 274The Adams-Thompsons are represented by Mr. Jack London of the law firm ofMorrison and Forster, San Francisco, CA. Mr. London’s telephone number is (415)677-7415. The Adams-Thompsons may be contacted through their attorney.QUESTION SEVENMyers QuestionPlease describe the dates and times when the aforesaid persons in Question #6werein direct contact with Plaintiff, and what offenses Plaintiff committed duringeach suchcontact.272 As the CID ROI reveals, there is in fact not a single item of evidenceestablishing probable cause tobelieve that Lilith or I committed any crime whatever.Note here also the CID’s repeating of its 1989 revision of the original 9-10/86A-T allegations to fittheir agenda prohibiting any finding of our innocence and the A-Ts’ crime.273 No published information to date verifies that any child connected with thePresidio “abuse” scamwas actually sexually abused, and the “timeline” factor indicates that theentire scam was based onnothing more than the same opportunism which had instigated previous “abuse”scams.274 This “unreliability”, however, did not prevent the CID from bringing up thefalsified stories of thesecopycat parents and their coached children, and highlighting them as much aspossible in the ROI forpropaganda in furtherance of the CID agenda.- 568 -CID ResponseLTC Aquino and Kinsey Adams-Thompson had no scheduled direct contact. GaryHambright was Kinsey’s child care provider, 275 and Kinsey reported that she wassexually abused by Mr. Hambright and LTC Aquino. 276Steven Quigley stated that he saw LTC Aquino at the Child Development Center ontwo occasions (paragraph 7.17, CID Aquino ROI). 277The evidence in the Aquino ROI shows that these offenses probably occurredduringthe period between April and August 1986. 278QUESTION EIGHTMyers QuestionPlease describe all evidence for each person named in the Question #6 abovewhichdemonstrates that such person was kidnapped or sexually abused.CID ResponseSee response to Question #1. 279275 Hambright was Almond’s child care provider at the CDC only during the period9-10/86, duringwhich time Lilith and I were verified to be in Washington, D.C. on all datesAlmond attended the CDC.276 Almond never reported that she was sexually abused by Hambright and myself.This story wasinvented by her parents and simply alleged to their child when Chaplain A-T toldit to the SFPD on8/14/87.277 See annotation #4 to Question #4.278 There is no evidence whatever supporting the CID’s 1989 invention of apre-9/86 date for theoriginally-9-10/86 A-T allegations, except that our innocence of the allegationswas proven beyonddoubt, and this was unacceptable per the CID’s agenda.279 See annotations to response to Question #1.- 569 -In addition, Kinsey was interviewed or discussed the allegations of sexual abusewithher mother, 280 therapists at Letterman Army Medical Center, 281 the FBI, 282and the CID. 283 These multiple interviews are discussed in detail throughoutthe CID AquinoROI. Restating or summarizing this evidence is burdensome and the Defendantwantsto avoid the possibility of summarizing facts which Plaintiff may deemsignificant.However, attention is invited to the following pages, paragraphs, or exhibits ofthe CIDAquino ROI:a.

Paragraphs 7.7, 7.8; Interviews of CPT and Mrs. Adams-Thompson. 288280 There is only Michele A-T’s word for this, and the adult A-Ts were caught innumerous liesconcerning their fabricated allegations against Lilith and myself, all of whichthe CID ignored in itsagenda. Additionally the A-Ts filed $3 million in fraudulent claims against thegovernment, whichgave them both a strong incentive to lie and a proportionate incentive toprevent their lies from beingexposed. See A-T Violations.281 Only one therapist at Letterman - Debbie Hickey - whose notes establishedthat she coachedAlmond into “allegations” when the child herself denied them. Thereafter Hickeyfurther“interpreted” what Almond recited in Hickey’s own desired scenario. See analysisof Hickey notes.282 Almond never identified or accused Lilith or myself of anything in any FBIinterview. See ExhibitG-3, FBI Interviews.283 Almond was never interviewed by the CID until April 1989, by which time theA-Ts had had twoyears to prepare her responses, and both incentive ($3 million claims) anddefensive (theircommission of criminal actions: false statements, fraudulent claims) motives todo so.284 Pages #18-27 contain only Hickey’s, the adult A-Ts’, and Harvey’s opinionthat Almond waskidnapped or assaulted. There is no evidence.285 Paragraph #3, page #38 contains only Larry A-T’s fabricated allegation ofthe “PX encounter”, aswell as his admission that he himself knew and recognized both Lilith and myselfwhen he saw us atthe PX. There is no evidence of Almond’s kidnapping or assault.286 Paragraph 4.1 contains Harvey’s distorted and selective accounts of (a) the8/13/87 FBI interviewof Almond, (b) the 8/14/87 trip to 123 Acme in which Almond made noidentification of it, (c) the4/7-8/89 CID interview of Almond, worthless because of her two years’conditioning and coaching byher parents and others, and also because of Harvey’s concealment of the originaltape and inaccurate“paraphrasing” of it (ROI Exhibit #45). There is no evidence of Almond’skidnapping or assault.287 There is no evidence of Almond’s kidnapping or assault in any of theseinterviews.288 There is no evidence of Almond’s kidnapping or assault in any of theseinterviews.- 570 -f.

They constitute no evidence of Almond’s kidnapping or assault.291 The 123 Acme trip report by SA Potter establishes (a) that Almond did not“identify” 123, and (b)that her mother and the investigators who took her there rigged the trip tocoach her to do so, thenlied about the failed results.

This constitutes noevidence of Almond’skidnapping or assault.292 This contains no evidence of Almond’s kidnapping or assault.293 This contains no evidence of Almond’s kidnapping or assault, and it containssignificant evidencethat no such events ever occurred and were deliberately and maliciouslyfabricated by the A-Ts.294 Ibid.295 Ibid.296 Ibid.297 Ibid.298 This contains only Larry A-T’s 2-year-later allegations, adapted to the1988-89 CID agenda.

Describe the persons diagnosed and thediagnosis in each case along with any physical or psychological evidence tosupport thediagnosis.CID ResponseLTC Deborah Hickey, MC diagnosed Kinsey Adams-Thompson as a victim of sexualabuse. Significant therapy sessions are documented in CID Aquino ROI on pages20-24. The therapy sessions were conducted from January to at least August 1987.Theknown dates are provided with Question #11. 305301 This verifies that I was not in San Francisco at any time during thepossible allegation window of9-10/86 when Almond was at the CDC.302 Exhibit 38 are selected and incomplete pages from the Hickey “therapy”notes. They contain noevidence of Almond’s kidnapping or assault, but abundant evidence of Hickey’sattempt tomanufacture such “evidence” by indoctrinating it into the child.303 This contains photocopies which Michele A-T alleged to be her diary,provided to the CID twoyears later, with obviously-faked marginal additions. This is not evidence ofAlmond’s kidnapping orassault.304 This contains only Harvey’s allegations of what Almond said in her CIDinterview two years later.It is worthless both because of the child’s conditioning by her parents andHarvey’s personal bias andofficial agenda.305 Hickey diagnosed Almond as a victim of sexual abuse despite Almond’sinitial, repeated denials, amedical examination showing her to be a virgin with no signs of any sexualabuse, and the lack of anymedical emergency during the 9-10/86 accusation window [or the 1989-invented CIDbackdate] thatwould have resulted from a sexual assault on Almond.The Hickey “therapy” session notes included with the Discovery CID ROI areextremely censored.Nevertheless even the ones provided show that Hickey simply harassed Almond intoreciting what shedesired, then further “interpreted” the recitations in her own “diagnosis”. Seeanalysis of Hickeynotes, and Hickey’s Affidavit.- 572 -LTC Hickey had a significant role in the diagnosis of Kinsey Adams-Thompson. 306LTC Hickey had numerous therapy sessions in which Kinsey mentioned ritualisticabuse by Mr. Gary, Mikey, Shamby, and persons by other names.307There was no physical evidence, such as vaginal or rectal tears, semen samples,orsexually transmitted diseases to support the diagnosis of sexual abuse (CIDAquinoROI, Exhibit 18). 308The psychological evidence is contained within the medical records of KinseyAdams-Thompson. Matters that a child should not know about are discussed byKinseyduring therapy. 309The medical records are lengthy. A shorter summary is contained at pages 20-24ofthe CID Aquino ROI. 310QUESTION TENMyers QuestionPlease confirm or deny that LTC Hickey diagnosed her own children as beingabused.CID ResponseOn June 8, 1987 during dinner, Jennifer Simmons, born on October 4, 1984, wasasked by her mother, LTC Hickey, about school (daycare at the CDC). Jennifertold LTCHickey about an incident in which a teacher whom she identified as Miss Nancyhadtaken pictures of her and a fellow student named Michael. These photographs weretaken at “Miss Nancy’s house”. Jennifer stated that Michael had kissed her orbit her onthe vagina while at Miss Nancy’s house. On June 22, 1987 Jennifer Simmons didnotprovide any information of investigative value to SA Foreman of the FBI. Thisinformation is documented at paragraph 6.9.1 and Exhibit 166, CID Hambright ROI306 Hickey was in fact the only Letterman “therapist” conducting the 8-monthindoctrination ofAlmond.307 All such statements were either made by Hickey or Almond’s mother, ortutored into Almond forher to recite. See Hickey Notes analysis.308 This is proof that Almond was never sexually assaulted as the A-Ts, Hickey,and the CIDdeliberately falsified.309 There is no “psychological evidence” other than the Hickey notes, and theseshow simply thatAlmond was harassed into reciting Hickey’s and Michele A-T’s “abuse” scenario.These two personsprovided all of the sexually-perverse information to Almond “that a child shouldnot know about”.310 Harvey’s page #20-24 summary is agenda-edited, and the actual Hickey notesprovided as an ROIexhibit are severely censored, in suppression of evidence and violation ofDiscovery.- 573 -0667-86-CID026-69776. The CID has never listed Jennifer Simmons or any of LTCHickey’s children as “victims” in any CID ROIs. 311The Defendant is not aware of any “diagnosis” as “abused” or “not abused”concerning LTC Hickey’s children. 312If LTC Hickey were questioned, she would say that she believed that her daughterwas sexually abused in connection with the Child Development Center at thePresidio,but not apparently in connection with LTC Aquino’s case. 313QUESTION ELEVENMyers QuestionPlease describe why LTC Hickey was permitted to continue in her role aspsychiatristto the persons named in Question #9 above when her own children were part of theevent. Describe the time-period that LTC Hickey was involved with any personnamedin Question #9 above.CID ResponseLTC Deborah Hickey, Medical Corps (MC) diagnosed Kinsey Adams-Thompson as avictim of sexual abuse. 314311 The question asked about Hickey’s children (plural), and the CID respondsconcerning only onedaughter. News media - Channel 2 television - reported both that Hickey had so“diagnosed” her ownchildren and had refused to be interviewed.If Hickey, a physician, immediately examined Jennifer’s vagina, obviously therewere no bitewounds.If this dinner conversation about the day’s school happened on 6/8/87, how is itthat Hickey didnot contact the school or the police about “Miss Nancy”? How is it that“Michael” or his parents werenot contacted [or, if contacted, denied the story]? Obviously the story provedfalse, otherwise “MissNancy” would have been arrested.In its answer the CID uses the plural - “any of LTC Hickey’s children” - butanswers the questiononly concerning Jennifer.312 Again the plural is used, indicating more than one Hickey child. Also theCID is indeed aware ofHickey’s “abuse diagnosis” concerning at least Jennifer, as it admits in thenext paragraph.313 In short, the CID’s evasive answer to Question #10 is “yes”.From its response, it is also clear that in the case of Jennifer, this“diagnosis” was made on nothingmore than a dinner remark which evidently proved to be physically and factuallyunsubstantiated.314 Hickey’s diagnosis was made solely on the basis of Hickey’s predeterminedagenda, in which sheaccepted no responses from Almond that denied sexual abuse. Hickey’spsychological diagnosis wasalso completely contradicted by Almond’s 3/12/87 physical examination, whichfound no signs of anysexual abuse. Hickey would certainly have been aware of this finding.- 574 -Significant therapy sessions are documented in CID Aquino ROI on pages 20-24.The therapy sessions are documented within CID Aquino ROI in Exhibit 38 as beingconducted on the following dates:a. January 20 and 27, 1987b. February 3 and 24, 1987c. March 24 and 30, 1987d. April 7, 21, and 28, 1987e. May 12, 19, and 26, 1987f. June 2, 9, 23, and 30, 1987g. July 2 and 7, 1987h. August 10, 1987The CID was required by Child Psychiatry, Letterman Army Medical Center (LAMC),to select pages from the Kinsey Adams-Thompson patient record based on relevancetothe investigation. The pages in the LAMC patient record were numbered from 1 toatleast 64. Thirty pages of the medical record had relevancy to the investigationand werephotocopied and marked Exhibit 38. (This is the reason that there are skips inthe pagenumbers at the bottoms of Exhibit 38.) CID Aquino ROI further summarizes Exhibit38by quoting some of the most significant therapy sessions on pages 20-24 of CIDAquinoROI. 315LTC Hickey had numerous therapy sessions in which Kinsey mentioned ritualisticabuse by Mr. Gary, Mikey, Shamby, and persons by other names.316In June 1987 medical personnel at Letterman Army Medical Center were advised byLTC Hickey that she was concerned about her own possible lack of objectivitycausedby the revelations of Jennifer. LTC Hickey’s supervisors at Letterman ArmyMedicalCenter decided that due to LTC Hickey’s strong rapport with her patients, sheshould315 In other words, only 32 pages (half or less, going by the CID statement of“at least 64”) of the entireHickey notes concerning Almond were included in the ROI, leaving one to wonderwhat wascontained in all the other pages. Clearly, “significant” in the jargon of theCID means “only thosepages that could be interpreted to frame the Aquinos”. The concealing of theother pages implies thatwhat was on those pages would, if known, demolish the CID’s, Hickey’s, and theA-Ts’ efforts evenmore transparently than the revealed pages.Harvey makes another effort to focus attention on his selective and deliberatelymisleadinginterpretation of the Hickey notes on pages #20-24 of the ROI, rather than onthe more difficult-to-read notes themselves.The distortion and bias of Harvey’s passages, and the true significance of justthe revealed Hickeynotes, are discussed in my “Hickey Notes Analysis”.316 Hickey had numerous sessions in which she and Michele A-T repeatedly coachedAlmond to recitetheir scenarios concerning Hambright, Mikey, Shamby, other persons, andritualistic abuse. See my“Hickey Notes Analysis”.- 575 -be allowed to continue to provide therapy to Kinsey Adams-Thompson and otherchildren, in the best interests of the children. 317QUESTION TWELVEMyers QuestionPlease describe with precision what false swearing Plaintiff allegedly engagedin.CID ResponseThe incidents regarding the false swearing and a discussion of misleadingstatements are provided at pages 2 and 28-38 of CID Aquino ROI. The falseswearingrelates to false portions of oral and written statements provided by LTC Aquino.318The written false statements are dated January 4, 1988, August 23, 1988, andJanuary 27, 1989, and were made at the Army Personnel Center, St. Louis, MO(Exhibits 5, 6, and 8, CID Aquino ROI). In these three written statements LTCAquinofalsely stated: (a) that he had never gone to the Presidio Child DevelopmentCenter, (b)that he did not sexually assault Kinsey Adams-Thompson, (c) that he had neverknowingly met Kinsey Adams-Thompson, and (d) that he did not bring or arrangeforGary Hambright to bring Kinsey Adams-Thompson to his building, 123 Acme. 319On January 4, 1988 and August 23, 1988, LTC Aquino made sworn statementsdeliberately understating Kinsey’s age in an effort to undermine her credibilitywithLTC Aquino’s and CPT Adams-Thompson’s military chain of command. On May 10 and317 No copy of such a request by Hickey is provided by the CID. No copy of hersuperiors’ answer isprovided. The supervisors are not named.The conspicuous reason is that it is a clear breach of medical ethics for such aconflict of interest tobe allowed to persist once identified, reflecting both on Hickey and on theunnamed superiors.Further, if Hickey believed Jennifer’s dinnertime remarks despite the obviousproofs that nothinghad happened to her [see annotations to Question #10], this further establishesHickey’sincompetence to make “abuse” diagnoses and her own agenda to conclude “abuse” inutter disregardof complete physical and circumstantial evidence to the contrary.This CID Response also indicates why Hickey’s later chain of command refused toopen aninvestigation into the medical competence and ethics of her conduct during thePresidio scam. If heractions were continuously sanctioned by these unnamed superiors, they would havebeen implicatedalong with her in any finding of malpractice. See my letters to Hickey’s CoC.318 Not a single inaccurate statement by me is identified by the CID except formy accidentalmistake concerning the age of Almond, as discussed below. As I simply denied theA-Ts’ falseallegations concerning Lilith and myself, and as the CID had a predeterminedagenda to sell thoseallegations, it just followed that the CID automatically called any statementthat I made in refutationof those falsehoods and that agenda “false swearing”.319 All these sworn statements by me are true, and included abundant evidence toprove that truth. Atthe time additional proofs, as I would later discover, were still concealed fromme by the CID.- 576 -11, 1989, by the legal materials LTC Aquino provided to the CID and the oral andwritten statements which he made, LTC Aquino showed that he was acutely awarethatthe younger he made Kinsey appear, the more likely she was not to be believed.In LTCAquino’s January 4, 1988 sworn statement LTC Aquino stated, “Adams-Thompsonalleges that he made the accusation based solely on comments elicited from his3-year-old stepdaughter (who was age 2 in October 1986)”. (See page 30 and Exhibit 5,CIDAquino ROI.) In LTC Aquino’s August 23, 1988 sworn statement at paragraph 19,LTCAquino states “Adams-Thompson alleges that he made the accusation based solelyoncomments elicited from his 3-year-old stepdaughter (who was age 2 in September1986)”. (See page 30 and Exhibit 6, CID Aquino ROI.) Kinsey celebrated her thirdbirthday on September 1, 1986. LTC Aquino had in his possession the SFPD AquinoROI that correctly indicated Kinsey was born on September 1, 1983. During theMay 10and 11, 1989 interviews, LTC Aquino explained that his incorrect statementsaboutKinsey’s age were due to confusion about newspaper accounts related to DavidTobin’sage (pages 31, 72, CID Aquino ROI). 320The January 4, 1988 sworn statement falsely states that CPT Larry Adams-Thompson made the allegation that LTC Aquino molested his daughter. LTC Aquinohad the SFPD Aquino ROI in his possession when he made this statement.AccordinglyLTC Aquino knew that Kinsey, rather than her stepfather, made this allegationagainstLTC Aquino. 321320 That the CID would try to make such a big issue out of my ignoranceconcerning Almond’s preciseage illustrates how desperate the CID was to find any mistake by me in theseveral sworn statementsand scores of signed letters and oral statements by me on the A-T scam.Since Almond was said to be 3 at the time her parents concocted theiraccusations against Lilithand myself (August 1987), and since the alleged date-window of those accusationswas almost a fullyear earlier (September-October 1986), I assumed that Almond would have been 2during that date-window. I didn’t bother to do precise math from her birthdate as indicated onthe SFPD IncidentReport (not “ROI”). [However, as I included that Incident Report as an exhibitto my swornstatements, I can hardly be said to have concealed Almond’s true age.]The fact that Almond was 3-and-1/6th rather than 2 during the 9-10/86 accusationwindow isimmaterial. Her credibility is not significantly different because of this.Ironically, if Almond’s credibility is to be invalidated during age 2, then theCID’s 1989-revision ofthe accusation date to June 1986 would also roll back Almond to the middle ofage 2, hence invalidateher credibility about anything she “recalled” about that period. Indeed in theROI the CID itselfadmits: “Kinsey’s confusion over who may have gone with her to the Aquinoresidence, and otherdetails, is not surprising when one recalls that she was less than 3 when shewas abducted from theCDC.” (ROI 2.6, page #48).With regard to Tobin, what I told the CID was that the Tobin child had beenreported in the mediaas age 2, and that before Lilith and I learned of the A-Ts’ being behind theattack on us, we assumedthat the Tobin parents were responsible, as they had been aggressively in themedia promoting thePresidio witch-hunts immediately prior to the surprise raid on our home.321 Larry A-T indeed invented and made the accusations against Lilith and myselfto the SFPDrecorded in the 8/14/87 Incident Report. Almond was not even present.- 577 -The charges sworn by LTC Aquino on January 4, 1988 against CPT Larry Adams-Thompson were false (a copy of the charges is at Exhibit 5, CID Aquino ROI). TheCID’sbasis for believing these charges to be false are described at pages 29-30, CIDAquinoROI. 322In paragraph 13a of LTC Aquino’s sworn statement of January 27, 1989 (Exhibit 8,CID Aquino ROI), LTC Aquino states that he goes by his legal first name of“Michael”.In the Army, LTC Aquino states that he is called “Mike”, and never “Mikey”. InTheChurch of Satan, at page 272, Diane LaVey, at that time LTC Aquino’s personalfriend,called LTC Aquino “Mike”. 323 During a CID interview Mr. Anton LaVey referred toLTCAquino as “Mike” or “Mikey”. Mr. LaVey’s interview is at paragraph 7.16, CIDAquinoROI. The CID discussion of this offense is at pages 36-37, CID Aquino ROI. 324On May 10 and 11, 1989, at his residence in St. Louis, LTC Aquino made a falseoralsworn statement to Special Agent Dan Cates of the CID. Paragraph 6.1, CID AquinoROI, summarizes the most significant aspects of LTC Aquino’s sworn oralstatement. Inthe May 10 and 11, 1989 statement LTC Aquino again falsely denied: (a) going tothePresidio Child Development Center, (b) sexually assaulting KinseyAdams-Thompson,(c) knowing Kinsey Adams-Thompson, and (d) knowing Gary Hambright. 325On May 10 and 11, 1989, at his residence in St. Louis, MO, LTC Aquino falselystatedthat only LTC Aquino, Mrs. Butch, and Mrs. Aquino had the security access codeof theupper-level apartment of 123 Acme. See lines 7-9, page 71, CID Aquino ROI. 326QUESTION THIRTEENMyers QuestionPlease describe all psychological medical evidence to support that any persondescribed in Question #6 above was sexually abused.322 The charges sworn by me on 1/4/88 were true, and the CID’s basis for denyingthat truth is that itcontradicted the CID’s predetermined agenda.323 What I said concerning my name is completely accurate.324 Letters from Anton LaVey during the entire time of our 6-year friendship,contained in The Churchof Satan provided to the CID, also verify that he called me only “Michael” or“Mike” during that time.Only during his 1989 interview with the CID - at which time he hated meobsessively for exposing his1975 corruption of the Church, as the CID also knew - did he maliciously andrepeatedly use the term“Mikey” to refer to me. The CID was also provided with several documents by meproving all othercharacter-attacks by LaVey during that interview false, which certainlyimpeaches his use of “Mikey”during that interview as well.325 All of these sworn statements made to SA Cates were true.326 The CID’s reason for calling this a “lie” is that the security alarmcompany, which monitored entryof the access code and was responsible for calling the police if it wereincorrectly entered, also knewthe code. Of course it did for the entire alarm system to work!- 578 -CID ResponseLTC Deborah Hickey, Medical Corps (MC) diagnosed Kinsey Adams-Thompson as avictim of sexual abuse. 327Significant therapy sessions are documented in CID Aquino ROI on pages 20-24.The therapy sessions are documented within CID Aquino ROI in Exhibit 38 as beingconducted on the following dates:a. January 20 and 27, 1987b. February 3 and 24, 1987c. March 24 and 30, 1987d. April 7, 21, and 28, 1987e. May 12, 19, and 26, 1987f. June 2, 9, 23, and 30, 1987g. July 2 and 7, 1987h. August 10, 1987The CID was required by Child Psychiatry, Letterman Army Medical Center (LAMC),to select pages from the Kinsey Adams-Thompson patient record based on relevancetothe investigation. The pages in the LAMC patient record were numbered from 1 toatleast 64. Thirty-two pages of the medical record had relevancy to theinvestigation andwere photocopied and marked Exhibit 38.LTC Hickey had numerous therapy sessions in which Kinsey mentioned ritualisticabuse by Mr. Gary, Mikey, Shamby, and persons by other names.LTC Hickey used “play therapy”, a process of using play to gain information fromthechild. The information is then used to resolve stress, which is often deeplysuppressedby the child. The therapist uses nonleading questions to resolve or clarifyissues for thechild. This methodology is discussed at pages 19-20, CID Aquino ROI. 328The psychological evidence is contained within the medical records of KinseyAdams-Thompson. Children under the age of five should not be aware of mattersrelated by Kinsey Adams-Thompson to LTC Hickey, absent sexual abuse. 329QUESTION FOURTEEN327 See annotations #1-3 to Question #11, as the CID merely repeats thoseResponses here.328 Even in 1989 the nationwide use of “play therapy” to instigate and pursue“daycare abuse” and“Satanic ritual abuse” witchhunts was notorious for its use of coaching,harassing, and leading ofchildren to recite whatever was demanded of them. Abundant literature exposingthis quacktechnique was provided to the CID. Since then, the technique has been exposedeven more widely,leading to its complete discrediting in the medical profession in the way thatit was used in the 1980switchhunts.329 Children under the age of 5 are quite capable of reciting whateverdisgusting sexual items aretaught to them, as the Hickey notes verify that Hickey did to Almond.- 579 -Myers QuestionPlease describe in detail the substance of the conversation held between SenatorHelms and Major General Overholt, TJAG, in late January or early February of1989,which is noted at Exhibit J of Plaintiff’s Request for Amendment of the TitlingAction.CID ResponseDefendant presently has not located any records which contain the substance of aconversation between Senator Helms and Major General Overholt, TJAG, in lateJanuary or early February of 1989. A review for these records is ongoing, andanyrecords discovered will immediately be provided to Plaintiff’s counsel. 330QUESTION FIFTEENMyers QuestionPlease describe in detail why the CID investigation did not commence untilNovember of 1988. Include Senator Helms’ role as well as the role of theSecretary ofthe Army, Mr. Marsh, and the Army Staff including TJAG, ODCSPER, DACH, PA,OCU, MSRA, SC.CID ResponseIn October or November 1988 the CID learned that the investigations previouslyconducted by the SFPD and FBI suffered from two significant weaknesses:331(a) failure to present the abused children with an adequate lineup, 332 and330 No document was ever provided indicating that the CID had made such arequest to either TJAGor Senator Helms, nor were any documents [or a statement that no such documentsexist] provided toPlaintiff. In short, the CID simply kept this crucial evidence of theHelms-driven agenda buried.331 In its Responses to Questions #1 and #15, the CID maintains that it“monitored and assisted theSFPD and FBI investigations”. [No documentary evidence that it did either foreither agency wasincluded in the ROI.] If the CID continues to insist that it “monitored andassisted” the SFPD & FBI,how is it that these “two significant weaknesses” were not seen in the 1-1/4years before the CIDopened its own investigation? There is no documentary evidence in the ROI thatthe CID evercomplained to the SFPD or FBI about such “significant weaknesses”, or indeedabout anything at allin their investigations.332 CID lie. The 8/2/88 San Francisco Chronicle states: “But there were apparentinconsistencies in[Almond’s] description, and nothing in the evidence or in interviews with atleast 26 other youngPresidio children ‘fully corroborated’ the girl’s account, [Deputy DistrictAttorney Michael]Williams said. And although some children saw Aquino on TV and told theirparents he was a ‘badman’, Williams said, none could pick him out of a Police photo lineup.”- 580 -(b) failure to establish the locations of LTC Aquino, Mr. Gary Hambright, andtheabused children during the April-October 1986 period. 333Based on the SFPD request for CID investigative action to resolve these twoweaknesses, 334 the CID determined that a video lineup and photographic lineupshouldbe shown to each CDC child that told any investigative agency or medicalauthority thatthey left the CDC with a CDC employee or other stranger.335 Since this would bea verysignificant effort, the Sixth Region CID decided to open a formal CIDinvestigation. 336There was no communication from anyone in Washington, D.C. that recommended tothe Six Region CID that an investigation by the CID should be opened. 337 TheCommander, Sixth Region, based upon recommendations from the Office of the Staff333 First, there was and is no evidence that any children were abused inconnection with the Presidioday-care witch-hunt. Secondly, the only accusation of “abuse” against Lilith andmyself was made bythe A-Ts, naming just a single child (Almond). Thirdly, Almond was underHambright’s supervisiononly during 9-10/86, so dates prior to 9/1/86 were irrelevant. Fourthly, thereis no documentaryevidence in the ROI that the SFPD “failed to establish my location” during the9-10/86 accusationwindow. My duty station, and finance & leave records, would certainly have beenavailable to theSFPD from the Army - or from me directly if the SFPD had communicated specificaccusation dates tomy attorney [it did not].334 There is no documentary evidence in the ROI of any SFPD request for the CIDto take any actionwhatever, including to “resolve any weaknesses” of its investigation.335 Showing a lineup to any Presidio CDC children after 1-1/4 years of massiveinternational publicityof Lilith and myself, to include our photo and video pictures, was in violationof CID regulations. TheCID conduct of such lineups violated several other CID regulations as well. See“CID LineupRegulations”.336 The CID states here that its only rationale for opening its investigationwas to conduct illegal"},{"pageContent":"lineups in violation of its own regulations and to falsify a new accusation datebecause of our proveninnocence during the 9-10/86 accusation window.337 As instructions to open a fraudulent CID investigation to intimidate andframe an innocent officerand his wife are a felony, the issuance of such instructions would indeed not beroutinely recorded,but would have been clandestine. That the CID investigation was openedimmediately after SenatorHelms’ demand to the Secretary of the Army that my career be destroyed - with noprior CIDinterest whatever - the circumstantial evidence of such clandestine instructionsis inescapable.Also inescapable is that in this Response the CID avoided all mention of theHelms-Marsh letters, aswell as of ODCSPER, DACH, PA, OCU, MSRA, SC (as specified in the Plaintiffquestion). That theseoffices were indeed involved is evidenced by the Department of the Army briefingthey all participatedin on 11/23/88 (the day the CID investigation was opened). (See Burton paper &attendance record).- 581 -Judge Advocate, U.S. Army Garrison, Presidio of San Francisco and the StaffJudgeAdvocate, Headquarters, Sixth Region CID, decided to open the CID Aquino ROI.338From February to May 1988 the SFPD conducted an investigation of theoff-Presidioallegations of child sexual abuse. 339 The CID role was to monitor thisinvestigation andassist as needed.340 The main investigative activity was by Detective Pamfiloffof theSFPD, who conducted numerous taped interviews of children from the PresidioChildDevelopment Center.From June to August 1988 the SFPD file was at the office of the DistrictAttorney,San Francisco for review and a prosecutive decision regarding LTC MichaelAquino,Mrs. Lilith Aquino, and Mr. Gary Hambright.In mid-August 1988 the SFPD file was returned to Detective Pamfiloff.Prosecutionwas declined absent additional evidence, which would require substantialadditionalinvestigative effort. 341From September to October 1988, Headquarters, Sixth Region and personnel fromthe San Francisco Field Office discussed the allegations against the AquinoswithDetective Pamfiloff, the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, the UnitedStatesAttorney’s Office, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 342338 No such recommendations are included or referenced in the ROI, nor providedto Plaintiff inDiscovery in this lawsuit. If such recommendations were, as the CID alleges,based on the “twosignificant weaknesses” discussed above, then the Commander, 6RCID, the SJAPresidio, and the SJA6RCID are guilty of conspiracy to violate CID evidentiary regulations (lineupprocedures) andmanufacture false “evidence” (the 1989 “backdating”).339 The SFPD investigation was opened 8/14/87 with Larry A-T’s false accusationsto Pamfiloff. It wasclosed 8/1/88 with the San Francisco District Attorney’s announcement that nocharges would befiled. The shorter, falsified date-span stated here by the CID is presumably tosuggest that the SFPDinvestigation was too brief.340 For the third time the CID falsely insists that it “monitored and assisted”the SFPD & FBIinvestigations.341 The SFPD investigation was formally closed not in “mid-August” but on8/1/88, when the SanFrancisco District Attorney announced that no charges would be filed ( SFChronicle 8/2/88). This isanother attempt by the CID to fabricate a shorter timespan between the SFPDclosing and the CIDopening on 11/23/88.342 No documentation of any such discussions is included or referenced in theROI, nor provided toPlaintiff in Discovery in this lawsuit.- 582 -From October 31, 1988 LTC Aquino was fingerprinted and photographed by CID. 343On November 1 through 3, 1988, copyright coordination was conducted by CID touse a tape of LTC and Mrs. Aquino from the Oprah Winfrey Show for a videolineup. 344On November 15 and 17, 1988 Detective Pamfiloff provided briefings toHeadquarters, Sixth Region and Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, United StatesArmyGarrison on the SFPD investigation. 345On November 23, 1988 Colonel W.D. Ray, Commander, Sixth Region, directed theopening of a formal investigation of LTC Michael A. Aquino, Mrs. Lilith Aquino,andMr. Gary Hambright for kidnapping and sexually assaulting children from thePresidioChild Development Center. 346On November 25 and 26, 1988, a Sixth Region, CID investigative plan andDepartment of Defense Inspector General subpoenas were drafted at Headquarters,Sixth Region, CID. 347On November 30 and December 1, 1988, Headquarters CID conducted meetings todiscuss the investigation of LTC Aquino. The November 30 meeting was attended bySixth Region and Headquarters CID personnel; the meeting on December 1 included343 Since the CID investigation was not opened until 11/23/88, the CID’sfingerprinting me on10/31/88 without alerting me to any such investigation or advising me of myConstitutional rightswas a violation of its own regulations and federal law. Additionally, that asthere was no furtherreference to my fingerprints in the ROI, they were very obviously not foundanywhere at the CDC(which was presumably thoroughly checked for prints at the beginning of thewitch-hunt in November1986). Additionally, this 10/31/88 fingerprinting was conducted soon afterSecretary of the ArmyMarch received Senator Helms’ 10/26/88 letter demanding that my career bedestroyed.344 As above, why was the CID conducting investigative actions concerning mewithout first formallyopening an investigation and advising me of my rights? Additionally CID plans toconduct a videolineup in 1989 are in violation of CID regulations concerning lineups. [See CIDRegulations.]345 No documentation of any such briefings by Pamfiloff is included orreferenced in the ROI, norprovided to Plaintiff in Discovery in this lawsuit.346 As the CID’s stated reasons for opening its investigation were to conductillegal lineups and falsifyaccusation dates [see above], then Ray’s direction was in violation of federallaw. At this time the CIDpossessed conclusive evidence that neither Lilith nor I had assaulted Almond(not “children”) as theA-Ts alleged.347 No documentation of any such investigative plan is included or referenced inthe ROI, norprovided to Plaintiff in Discovery in this lawsuit. Indeed the CID attempts topresent a 10/17/88 letterfrom Harvey (Defendant Ex. #G-3) as its “investigative plan”, although thatletter consists simply ofHarvey’s suggestions for various violations of law by the CID in the conduct ofany investigation. [Ref.Harvey Investigative Letter]. The use of Inspector General subpoenæ is reservedto IG investigations,and their deliberate misuse by the CID to circumvent law-enforcement subpoenarequirements isillegal.- 583 -representatives from the Criminal Law Division, OTJAG, and the Army GeneralCounsel’s Office. 348Attendees at both meetings agreed that the initial titling decision and theinvestigative plan were appropriate. No one said anything at the meetings aboutanyinterest by Senator Helms, the Army Staff, or the Secretary of the Army in theoutcomeof the investigation. 349 The goal of the investigation was to correct theweaknesses ofthe previous investigations.350 These investigative efforts could clear LTCAquino orthey could generate sufficient evidence for a court-martial. 351 The interestsof justicewould best be served by making the best possible investigative effort tocorroborate orrefute the allegations of Kinsey Adams-Thompson and the other children. 352QUESTION SIXTEENMyers QuestionPlease describe why Plaintiff was denied continuation as an AGR officer. Includeadescription of whether or not the Continuation Board knew of Plaintiff’sflagging or theCID investigation. If the Continuation Board was informed of Plaintiff’sflagging or theCID investigation, state whether such knowledge were properly before the board.Ifsuch knowledge were before the board, state why such knowledge was given to theboard.348 No documentation of any such meetings is included or referenced in the ROI,nor provided toPlaintiff in Discovery in this lawsuit. If such meetings occurred, and ifrepresentatives from TJAG andthe Army General Counsel’s Office agreed with the CID’s conspiracy tomanufacture and falsifyevidence, then these representatives and offices thereby proved theirparticipation in the conspiracy -and probable direction of it, as they are superior to the CID in the Army chainof command.349 Concerning the initial titling decision, see Note #8 above. As above, therewas no “investigativeplan”. As the letters from Helms to Marsh were confidential and in violation offederal law, they wouldcertainly not be identified or discussed except at the highest levels of theArmy, as the Judge AdvocateGeneral of the Army’s personal briefing of Helms evidences. [Ref trip to briefHelms].350 There were no such “identified weaknesses” See note above.351 As evidenced from the ROI and all other CID actions connected with thiscase, the CID never madeany attempt whatever to clear Lilith and myself, and instead suppressed orignored all exculpatoryevidence and manufactured false “evidence” in its agenda to frame us for anonexistent crime. Forinstance, the CID’s corruption of the AGR continuation board took place at thevery beginning ofits investigation. [Ref AGR board].352 The CID, however, ignored the interests of justice in the conduct of thisinvestigation, in favor of itspredetermined agenda. Again, the allegations were not made by Almond, or anyother CDC child, butby the A-Ts.- 584 -CID ResponsePlaintiff was not found fully qualified in accordance with AR 135-18, paragraph4-11. 353 There is no record reflecting whether the Continuation Board knew ofPlaintiff’sflagging or a CID investigation. 354QUESTION SEVENTEENMyers QuestionPlease state why Plaintiff was denied promotion to full colonel. State whetheror notPlaintiff’s titling was before the promotion board.CID ResponsePlaintiff was not found fully qualified in accordance with AR 135-55, paragraph3-9. 355 There is no record reflecting whether Plaintiff’s titling was beforethe promotionboard.356QUESTION EIGHTEENMyers QuestionPlease describe in detail what steps Defendant, through the CID, has taken tocorroborate the Adams-Thompsons’ rendition of events. State what corroboratingevidence exists to support the Adams-Thompsons’ rendition of events.353 I was fully qualified in accordance with AR 135-18.354 I was informed by the SJA, ARPERCEN that he had been asked by the boardwhether I wereflagged and had answered “yes” in violation of AR 135-18. When writing thisresponse, the CID wasalso aware - but concealed from Plaintiff - that it had deliberately corruptedthe Continuation Board.[See Harvey/Tate statement.]355 Promotions to full colonel are on a “best qualified”, not a “fullyqualified” (as are AGR continuationdecisions) basis.356 This response evades a direct answer. As the CID knows, all promotion boardrecords aredestroyed at the conclusion of each board. As with its corruption of the AGRboard, the CID wouldknow if it had similarly corrupted the promotion board, but again takes refugebehind a “no record”answer.- 585 -CID ResponseSee response to Questions #1 and #8. 357In addition, Kinsey’s statements were corroborated by interviews of CPT and Mrs.Adams-Thompson, who established Kinsey’s shocked reaction to sighting LTC Aquinoin the Presidio Post Exchange (paragraph 7.7 and 7.8, CID Aquino ROI).358 Thereceiptfrom the Post Exchange as well as LTC and Mrs. Aquino’s statements establishthat theAquinos were present in the Presidio Post Exchange on August 12, 1987 (paragraph6.1and 6.2, CID Aquino ROI).359 Kinsey’s recognition of 123 Acme as the place whereshewas taken by LTC Aquino corroborated her allegations. 360 LTC Aquino’s leavethroughout the summer of 1986, and LTC Aquino’s statement that he remained inSanFrancisco during this leave eliminated a possible alibi defense (paragraph 6.1,CIDAquino ROI). 361 Mr. Gary Hambright’s presence at the Presidio CDC on a dailybasismade it possible for Mr. Hambright to remove children from the Presidio CDC. 362ThePresidio CDC’s failure to maintain proper care of the children (parentsindicated thatthe Presidio CDC often did not know the locations of their children; when it wastime to357 See annotations to Questions #1 and #8.358 As the adult A-Ts were the only ones who on 8/14/87 alleged that the “PXsighting reaction” byAlmond ever occurred [neither Almond nor anyone else made any statement about itfor two years,after which time the A-Ts had had ample opportunity to train her into recitingthe story], the A-Tscannot “corroborate” their own story.359 The fact that Lilith and I were present in the PX on 8/13/87 corroborates nocrime whatever.360 No corroboration. Almond did not recognize 123 Acme, despite the FBI’s andher mother’sattempts to coach her into such an “identification”. See 123 Identificationtrip.361 First, an alibi defense for any time-period prior to 9-10/86 is unnecessary,because Almond wasnever under Hambright’s care or control at the CDC prior to that time. Second,Graham Marshallindeed provided an absolute alibi defense for the 1989-invented CID “backdate”to 6/10/86. Third, allof the other children who were at the CDC with Almond on 6/10/86, whom in 1989she said “weretaken with her” contradicted the A-Ts’ falsified story (para 2.6-7, CID ROI).362 Children at the CDC were assigned to specific teachers in specific classes,and only children 3 yearsand older were assigned to Hambright (Presidio HQ letter to parents). Almond didnot turn 3 until9/1/86. Secondly, the A-Ts both stated to the FBI in their original interviewsclosest to the 9-10/86accusation window that they noticed nothing wrong with Almond until that 9-10/86period (A-Ts’original 1/87 FBI interviews). Third, Hambright denies the A-Ts’ allegations(Statement ofHambright). Fourth, all other CDC teachers and staff denied that Hambrightabused children or thatthey watched his classes while he took any children away anywhere (para. 2.8.1,CID ROI).- 586 -pick up the children, the parents had to look all over the CDC to find them).363 StevenQuigley also placed LTC Aquino at the Presidio CDC (paragraph 7.17, CID AquinoROI). 364 Other children interviewed by the CID and medical personnel describedritualistic sexual abuse similar to that suffered by Kinsey Adams-Thompson(pages48-55, CID Aquino ROI). 365 The interior contents of the Aquino residenceprovidelimited corroboration of the statements of Kinsey Adams-Thompson. 366 Some oftheitems that Kinsey Adams-Thompson told LTC Hickey were contained in the housewhere she was sexually assaulted were found and photographed by the FBI duringthesearch conducted in August 1987 (page 22, and paragraph 19.10, Aquino CID ROI).367However this corroboration was limited due to the redecoration by the Aquinosand thepassage of time between the sexual assault and the search by the FBI (pages47-48, CIDAquino ROI). 368363 While some parents may have had to look “all over” the CDC to find theirchildren, descriptions ofthe CDC indicate that it was a single, small building with a fenced playground.That is hardlysignificant of “failure to maintain proper care”, particularly if children wereallowed to play with oneanother freely. Additionally the A-Ts never complained at any time that theycouldn’t locate Almond.Additionally Almond was always an unscheduled “drop-in” attendee, so any“abductor” would nothave known when her parents would return.364 No corroboration. See Annotations to Question #4.365 Almond never mentioned “ritualistic sexual abuse” prior to being taught itby Hickey and MicheleA-T, as the Hickey notes verify. No other Presidio children alleged that Lilithor I had committed anycrime whatever. Finally, “therapist”- and parent-network-taught “descriptions ofritualistic sexualabuse” were a standard feature of all “abuse” witchhunts of the 1980s, andparticularly afterMcMartin.366 No corroboration. The actual contents of our home were not described in anyway by Almondbefore her parents and investigators knew exactly what it looked like from FBIphotos taken duringthe 8/14/87 search warrant execution.367 First, Almond never told Hickey that she was sexually assaulted, except torecite Hickey’spromptings that she was. Secondly, no corroboration. Many if not all homescontain “toys/stuffedanimals, computer, guns”. Of the other items that Harvey lists, they were eithernot ever mentionedby Almond to Hickey [see Hickey analysis] or did not exist in our home as Harveydescribes them.What page #22 evidences is simply another effort by Harvey to manufacture“evidence” in obstructionof justice.ROI paragraph #19.10 states that a notebook page containing the name “Mike Todo”in a list ofnames and phone numbers. As the CID was informed, this list was of persons whocalled concerningan apartment-vacancy advertisement. The CID did not bother to contact any of thepersons on the list,including Todo, to verify this. That the CID did not consider this as anythingother than a device tocontinue the frame of us is verified by the fact that they didn’t make anyattempt to contact Todo.368 First, there was no sexual assault at our home. Secondly, Harvey has nogrounds whatever to statethat our repairs and repainting “limited” the [nonexistent] “corroboration”.- 587 -Additionally, Kinsey made references to Satanism by hand gestures to her motherand LTC Hickey (page 23, Exhibit 42, CID Aquino ROI). 369 LTC Aquino’s writingsandstatements provide ample corroboration that he is involved in the Temple of Set,whosesource is the Church of Satan. 370 Kinsey said that she was taken by Mr. GaryHambrightto a room with blankets on the walls (Exhibit 42, Diary of Mrs. Adams-Thompson,Exhibit 45 MFR by Major Harvey, CID Aquino ROI). 371 Aspects of Temple of Setworship include religious activities in a draped room (pages 27 and 29, CIDAquinoROI). 372 Religious ceremonies for the Temple of Set were conducted in 123 Acmein theapartment on the street level (paragraph 8.16, CID Aquino ROI).373QUESTION NINETEENMyers QuestionPlease state why Plaintiff remains titled when Plaintiff’s wife, a supposed co-conspirator, was dropped from titling for lack of probable cause. State whetherDefendant believes Plaintiff acted alone.If Defendant does not believe Plaintiff acted alone, then state with whomPlaintiffacted.369 No, Michele A-T, who wrote this in her diary after Hickey reports thatMichele provided her withpapers about “Satanic ritual abuse” [even if one assumes the photocopies of the“lost” diary providedin 1989 to be genuine], knew about this sign. There is no account anywhere ofAlmond using itspontaneously prior to her mother’s interest in this theme.370 The fact that I have been a senior religious official in the Church of Satanand Temple of Set hasbeen well-known and publicized since 1970 and 1975 respectively, includingthroughout the Army,and thus “corroborates” nothing.371 This is not a statement by Almond, but an allegation by Michele A-T in anobviously-manufactured marginal note in the photocopy of her “lost diary” provided in 1989[after the A-Ts hadbeen informed by the FBI that our home included a room with upholstered walls].No“corroboration”.372 No activities of the Temple of Set, as abundantly documented throughout itsrecords since 1975,include “Satanic ritual abuse”. As the CID knows, no children are permitted tojoin the Temple, or toparticipate or even be present at any of its activities, ritual or nonritual.Secondly, no draped roomwas found in the search warrant execution. Thirdly, the original plaster wallsin our apartment [andthat of Butch, to which the CID tried in 1991 to “relocate” the “crime”] wouldhave shown nail or otherhigh-up damage from hanging drapes or blankets. The CID never bothered to look,nor to request tolook. Nor, had it looked, would it have found any such damage. Nor were anyblack blankets or drapesfound in our home during the search warrant execution. Also many Temple of Setmembers who hadattended religious ceremonies at our home could easily have testified that wenever covered any partof our walls for them, nor did Butch. The CID never requested or attempted anysuch interviews.373 The simple fact that religious ceremonies for the Temple of Set wereconducted at the homes ofPriests of that religion “corroborates” nothing.- 588 -If Defendant does not state that Plaintiff acted with Plaintiff’s wife, statewhatevidence points to Plaintiff acting without Plaintiff’s wife, and state howDefendantconcluded the titling conduct was done without participation of Plaintiff’swife.CID ResponseKinsey Adams-Thompson’s medical records indicate that Kinsey Adams-Thompsonsaid that Mr. Gary Hambright, “Mikey”, “Shamby”, “Todo”, “Kathy”, “Dr. Steve”,and/or “Sassy” were at the bad house where she was sexually molested. 374 OnceKinsey saidthat “Mikey” and “Shamby” were married (page #24, CID Aquino ROI). 375 Onanotheroccasion, Kinsey said that Sassy was Todo’s girlfriend (page 21, CID AquinoROI). 376The Defendant believes that Mr. Gary Hambright, LTC Michael Aquino, “Shamby”,and possibly others conspired to remove Kinsey Adams-Thompson from the CDC forpurposes of ritualistic sexual abuse. 377The decision to delete Mrs. Aquino from the subject block was based uponKinsey’sinability to pick Mrs. Aquino out of the video lineup (paragraph 9.19, CIDAquinoROI). 378 On August 12, 1987 Kinsey identified Mrs. Aquino as “Shamby”. 379However,374 Harvey refers to Hickey’s “play-therapy” notes, not to physical medicalexamination records. As theCID provided only those pages of the Hickey notes that it felt it could use inthe frame attempt, theannotations here may be supplemented by even more exculpatory facts in theillegally-concealedpages. Concerning these names, see in the analysis of the Hickey notes why noneof them refer in theleast sensibly to Lilith or myself.375 Per the Hickey notes it is Michele A-T, not Almond, who introduces the name“Mikey” on6/30/87, then alleges “Mikey” as “Shambee’s husband”, then proceeds with hintsthat “Mikey” is anArmy officer. Obviously the A-Ts had decided to accuse Lilith and myself in thewitch-hunt by thistime, and here Michele began to lay the groundwork.376 Almond never - even in the A-Ts’ falsified “PX encounter” - referred to meas “Todo” or Lilith as“Sassy”. Moreover Almond’s comments concerning “Todo” and “Sassy” in the Hickeynotes are soirrational as to be meaningless. See Hickey notes analysis.377 If the CID believes this in disregard of the massive and conclusive evidencethat no such crime everoccurred, then the CID is incompetent. More obviously, of course, the CID issimply reciting apredetermined agenda in which all factual evidence is irrelevant.378 The decision to delete Lilith from the subject block was based upon myattorney Gary Myersreminding the CID that its titling of a civilian is illegal under PosseComitatus law. When the CIDlearned that a lawsuit would follow any less-than-complete retraction of itsfraudulent ROI, itremoved what it thought were the most conspicuous and indefensible titlings,such as Lilith as acivilian and all titlings of me based on my religion per se. Almond’s 1989ability to recognize eitherLilith or myself after two years of parental and investigator prompting is asirrelevant here aselsewhere.379 On 8/6/87 the A-Ts recognized Lilith and myself in the Presidio PX andfalsely alleged “reaction/recognition” by Almond, in keeping with their plan which first appeared on6/2/87 with Michelelaying the groundwork for Aquino accusations with Hickey. See PX expose andHickey notes expose.- 589 -Mrs. Aquino’s proximity to LTC Aquino when viewed by Kinsey Adams-Thompson inthe Presidio Post Exchange parking lot made this identification too suggestiveto bereliable by itself. 380The Defendant believes that Mrs. Aquino is the most likely suspect to be“Shamby”.However, this belief falls slightly short of “probable cause”. 381 During thevideo lineup,Kinsey’s statement that woman #2 was “Shamby” indicates that Kinsey believed awoman of very similar appearance to Mrs. Aquino was “Shamby”.382 Defendant hasgiven Mrs. Aquino the benefit of the doubt. 383 It is possible that a female ofsimilardescription to Mrs. Aquino was involved in the ritualistic sexual abuse ofKinseyAdams-Thompson at 123 Acme without the participation of Mrs. Aquino. 384 Inrecognition of this possibility, the Commanding General of CID decided to removeMrs.Aquino from the title block. 385 Defendant does not believe Plaintiff actedalone.Defendant believes Plaintiff acted with Mr. Gary Hambright and with otherunnamedand unidentified persons, who may include Mrs. Aquino. 386380 As Lilith and I were together the entire time at the PX, including withinthe store, then by the samelogic Almond’s “identification” of me beside Lilith would have been “toosuggestive to be reliable byitself”. See PX expose.381 If “Shambee” as Almond initially described her in the Hickey notes is either“a friend of hers atschool who was spanked by Mr. Rogers on TV” and “had its (sic) neck broken”[probably a doll], thenthere are no grounds for the CID to consider Lilith “Shambee”. On 7/7/87 Hickeyasked Almond ifShambee worked at the school. Almond’s answer - and the next three pages of theHickey notes - wereconcealed by the CID and not provided to Plaintiff in Discovery.382 No, Almond’s statement that woman #2 was “Shamby” indicates that Almondthought woman #2was “Shamby”. So why did the CID not title woman #2 if a single 1989 lineupresponse from Almondconstituted “probable cause” to title, overwhelming all other considerations andevidence?383 The CID never gave Lilith any “benefit of the doubt” from the beginning, andin disregard of allserious evidence titled her for kidnapping and child molestation simply becauseshe was married tome and to fulfill its agenda to intimidate me and destroy my career, the CIDthreatened andhumiliated my wife as well.384 There is no evidence that Almond was ever sexually abused and/or kidnappedto 123 Acme byLilith or myself. If the CID now changes its tune to portray Lilith as (a)evidence that Almond’s alleged“PX identification” was unreliable and (b) uninvolved with the A-Ts’“kidnap/rape” scenario, then itwould have to explain why Lilith, who lived in our home and provided a swornstatement that no such“kidnap/rape” ever occurred, was not believed. Secondly, as Almond’s failure to“recognize” Lilith iscalled significant, the CID has no grounds to insinuate that a resemblance toher is significant.385 In light of the rampant violations of law throughout the ROI, the CIDCommanding General’ssudden attack of gallantry is ludicrous. Lilith’s name was removed from thetitling block for thereasons annotated above.386 In fact, Defendant knows that no such “crime” took place at all, and“believes” only the Helmsmission it was given to do.- 590 -QUESTION TWENTYMyers QuestionPlease state why June 10, 1986 is viewed as the critical date in this matter.CID ResponseJune 10, 1986 is viewed as a significant date in the investigation, but notnecessarilya critical date. 387Kinsey Adams-Thompson was one of the three children receiving care at the CDC onJune 10, 1986.388 Each of the three children said that at least one of the othertwo were387 When the CID discovered that Lilith and I were in Washington, D.C. on alldates during the A-T9-10/86 accusation window when Almond was at the Presidio daycare center,providing an absolutealibi proving our innocence and the A-Ts’ conspiracy to make false allegationsand defraud thegovernment, the CID [in 1989] examined my Army records to find out when I hadpreviously been inthe city of San Francisco - three months before the 9-10/86 window - and simplycreated a newaccusation date, as finding us innocent was not permitted in its agenda. Whenthe CID says that 6/10is “significant but not critical”, it means that it was now treating theaccusations as applicable to anydate whatever. Had 6/10 proved inconvenient, the CID would clearly have eitherproduced anotherdate out of thin air or simply ignored the entire date-question, treating theA-T accusations as validfor all of 1986 [at least]. This CID mindset appears in Harvey’s initial12/14/88 letter to me, whichasks not only for “all dates when LTC and Mrs. Aquino lived in San Francisco”but also “the dateswhen LTC and Mrs. Aquino were in San Francisco between January 1986 and July1987”.388 There is no evidence in the ROI or elsewhere as to how many childrenattended the CDC on6/10/86, but presumably it was more than three.- 591 -(sic) with them at the “scary house”.389 Page 48, CID Aquino ROI explains whythisdate was considered the most likely date of the offense. 390 See also pages19-24[5],48-49[6], and 52-53[7], CID Aquino ROI to cross-reference the statements of thechildren.QUESTION TWENTY-ONEMyers QuestionPlease state who wrote the CID Report of Investigation. Give addresses and phonenumbers of such persons.389 The CID focuses on these three because of their alleged statements that “atleast one of the othertwo were (sic) with them at the ‘scary house’”. Apparently the entire CDCteaching staff denied thatany such abduction took place, and all of the [presumably many] other childrenat the CDC deniedseeing any such abduction either. This preponderance of the evidence isconcealed by the CID.The CID identifies the “other two” as Evan Fox and Kara Bailey. The CID statesthat the 6/10/86revised date was invented in 1989 because that was “one date that Pamfiloffindicated Almond, Fox,and Bailey were present together in the CDC”. No indication as to how Pamfiloffconcluded this isgiven in the ROI or elsewhere. However in the same ROI paragraph (2.6, page #48)the CID statesthat “there are gaps in the records obtained from the Presidio CDC which make itdifficult to reliablyshow when Kinsey Adams-Thompson, Kara Bailey, and Evan Fox were together in theCDC”. So theCID can’t even reliably state that 6/10/86 is such a date.Fox’ pre-CID interviews contain such scrambled and inconsistent statements as tobe meaningless.(CID ROI 2.6.1, pages #48-51). On the other hand on 4/19/89 Fox denied to theCID “that he wasremoved from the CDC without his parents’ permission by Mr. Hambright or theAquinos” (CID ROI2.6.1.(e), page #51). The Fox parents had a compelling motive to push the imageof the Presidio scamas actual molestation, as they had filed $6 million in claims based upon this.Bailey, like Fox, made no alleged references to anything remotely suggestingLilith and myself untilafter the A-T accusation publicity, when Bailey’s mother (a close friend of theA-Ts, ROI 2.6.3) madeallegations on Kara’s behalf in support of the A-Ts’ allegations. ThereafterBailey was interviewed byPamfiloff and “either would not or could not identify LTC or Mrs. Aquino” and“repeatedly said shedid not recognize the pictures from the Aquino/Acme residence” (ROI 2.6.3). On4/23/89 Baileydenied to the CID “that she was removed from the CDC without her parents’permission by Mr.Hambright or the Aquinos” (ROI 2.6.3, page #53).So not only did Lilith and I, Hambright, the entire rest of the teaching staffof the CDC, and allother children at the CDC deny any 6/10/86 “kidnapping & sexual abuse”, but sodid both EvanFox and Kara Bailey, whom Almond supposedly said were with her. Against thisthere isonly Almond’s two-years-later, parental/“therapist”-coached, andinternally-contradictory answersto CID questioning, which “confusion” the CID states “is not surprising when onerecalls that she wasless than 3 when she was abducted from the CDC” (ROI 2.6, page #48.390 The CID’s rationale for picking 6/10/86 for its 1989 invented date was onlythat Almond, Bailey,and Fox supposedly attended the CDC that day. However both Bailey and Fox deniedthat any such“kidnapping & sexual abuse” ever occurred, on that or any other day [seeprevious note].- 592 -CID ResponseMajor Mark W.

His duties includeproviding legal advice to investigators and reviewing investigations for legalsufficiency,including titling determinations such as this one. In the course of these dutiesMajorHarvey discussed the investigation with representatives of the San FranciscoPoliceDepartment, the FBI, other military attorneys, his military superiors, and withLTCAquino, his military defense counsel Captain Thomas Hayes, and his civiliancounselMr. Gary Myers. Major Harvey interviewed most of the significant witnesses intheinvestigation and wrote pages #15-57 of the ROI. 395QUESTION TWENTY-THREEMyers QuestionPlease state whether or not a claim on behalf of Kinsey Almond has been filedwiththe Army Claims Service, and if so in what amount.CID ResponseA claim on behalf of Kinsey Adams-Thompson has been filed with the Army ClaimsService for the amount of $1,500,000. 396395 In other words, Harvey conducted the “investigation” and wrote the ROI,which he represented tomy Army attorney Captain Hayes as “approved” before Colonel Ray had even seenit, much lessaffixed his signature to it. See Ray correspondence.396 In fact the A-Ts filed claims for a total of $3 million - twice the amountthe CID admits here. TheCID’s falsification of the amount is obviously to minimize the A-Ts’ obviousfinancial motive forfabricating their accusations.- 594 -QUESTION TWENTY-FOURMyers QuestionDescribe in detail for each offense listed below what evidence Defendant relieduponto conclude that probable cause existed to believe Plaintiff committed suchoffenses: (a)Conspiracy, (b) Kidnapping, (c) Sodomy, (d) Indecent Acts, (e) False Swearing.CID ResponseSee response to Questions #1 and #8. 397Kinsey told the FBI, LTC Hickey, and her mother:398(a) that “Mr. Gary” (Hambright), “Mikey” (LTC Aquino) and “Shamby” (dark hairedwhite female) removed her from the Presidio Child Development Center to a houseidentified as 123 Acme (conspiracy and kidnapping);399(b) that while at a house identified by the FBI as 123 Acme, “Mr. Gary” and“Mikey”forced Kinsey to commit sodomy on them (conspiracy and sodomy);400(c) that while at a house identified by the FBI as 123 Acme, “Mr. Gary” and“Mikey”committed indecent acts upon Kinsey when they forced her to touch their penis(sic)(conspiracy and indecent acts). 401397 See Annotations to Questions #1 and #8.398 Kinsey told the FBI and Hickey none of the following, as evidenced by theFBI reports and theHickey notes included in the ROI. As for Michele A-T, there are only herallegations that Almondmade any accusatory statements to her whatever, and these Michele allegationsare impeached byAlmond’s own recorded statements to the contrary to the FBI and Hickey - as wellas Michele’s ownforged/“lost” diary, $3 million motive, and own contradictory statements whentrying with herhusband to fabricate the accusations. See A-T Violations.399 Almond never described me as “Mikey” to either Hickey or any investigator atthe time of herparents’ 1987 accusations. Almond made no mention of “Shambee”’s hair-color orrace in the Hickeynotes. [On 4/7/87 Almond said that Shambee and Sassy were the same person, thendescribed Sassyas having blonde hair (4/7), then “black hair like Hickey” (who has brown hair)(4/28), then blondehair again (5/12). Almond also said that Sassy had “yellow eyes like Hickey”(who has green eyes)(4/28). Lilith has neither blonde nor brown hair, nor yellow or green eyes.Almond never “identified” 123 Acme as anything at all, despite the repeatedprompting of the FBIand Michele A-T to get her to do so. See 123 Acme portion of A-T Violations andROI Exhibit #1.400 As noted above, 123 Acme was never identified as any “crime scene” whatever.There is noevidence that Hambright and/or I ever “forced Kinsey to commit sodomy”. Thereare only herparents’ fabricated accusations.401 Ibid.- 595 -The evidence that supports false swearing is provided in the response toQuestion#12. 402The CID Aquino ROI contains relevant evidence that tends to corroborate theseessential facts. 403QUESTION TWENTY-FIVEMyers QuestionState when and when the offenses of conspiracy, kidnapping, sodomy, and indecentacts occurred, and describe what evidence supports each conclusion.CID ResponseThe most probable location of the offense is the street level apartment, rentedby Mr.Butch and owned by LTC Aquino at 123 Acme. See response to Question #2. 404The time of the offenses was May, June, July, or August 1986. This is based onthebelief that Mr. Gary Hambright and LTC Michael Aquino were both in San Franciscoduring these months, and that Kinsey Adams-Thompson received care from thePresidio CDC at diverse times during these months.405 There is evidence thatKinsey402 There was no false swearing. See Annotations to Question #12.403 The ROI contains no evidence whatever corroborating either the original A-Taccusations or theCID’s 1989 attempts to revise them to fit its agenda. See in particularAnnotations to Question #18.404 The first speculation of the Butch apartment was in 1991, after GrahamMarshall testified that nochildren were present in our apartment. There is no evidence supporting the CIDspeculation at all.See Annotations to Question #2.405 Hambright had no supervision or control over Almond until September 1986.See January 1987FBI interviews with the A-Ts (CID Lawsuit Exhibit #G2 - omitted from theoriginal ROI), as well asPresidio DPCA letter 12/15/86. The fact that Hambright and/or I were in the samelarge city, andduring a time when Hambright had no supervision or control over Almond whatever,is not evidenceof anything except CID efforts to manufacture “evidence”. Finally, if Almondindeed received care atthe CDC during May-August 1986, why did the CID not investigate or interview theCDC teachers whodid supervise her during that period? All such teachers - none of whom were everindicted orconvicted of any crime whatever - denied witnessing any such “kidnapping orabuse” of Almond atany time (ROI 2.8.1).- 596 -departed the Presidio CDC on at least one occasion with Mr. Hambright. 406 Thespecificdate is unknown. 407See response to Question #24. 408QUESTION TWENTY-SIXMyers QuestionState specifically what evidence supports the identification of Plaintiff as aparticipant. State what person made the identification, to whom, when, and underwhatcircumstances.CID ResponseThe evidence that supports the identification of Plaintiff as a participant iscontainedin the FBI interviews, which are discussed in detail in the SFPD Aquino ROI409and406 There is no evidence other than Almond’s coached recitations during theHickey notes. On 4/7/87Almond denied twice to Hickey being taken anywhere. Only after Hickey thencontinued to badgerher did she agree with Hickey. Secondly, whether Almond was ever taken anywhereby Hambright oranyone else at any time is not “evidence” of any crime whatever by Lilith ormyself.407 If “the specific date is unknown”, then the CID’s stated refusal to removemy name from the titlingblock “because the evidence of my alibi on 6/10/86 is not persuasive” isunjustified, as here the CIDsays that 6/10/86 is no more “known” than any other date.408 See Annotations to Question #24.409 None of the FBI interviews of Almond mentioned or discussed in the ROI evenmention my name,much less describe or “identify” me. The 1/26/87 FBI interviews of the A-Tsmention neither me noranyone resembling me. The 8/13/87 interviews of the A-Ts postdate their decisionto fabricateaccusations against Lilith and myself [evidenced in Michele A-T’s 6/2/87“Satanic cult” & 6/30/87“Mikey the Army officer/Shamby’s husband” suggestions to Hickey].

These interviews allpost-date the decision bythe A-Ts to invent fictitious accusations against us as proved by Michele A-T’s6/2/87 and 6/30/87suggestions to Hickey. Additionally in these interviews:(a) Almond mentions nothing whatever about any “PX identification by her”(supposedly only theprevious day), and does not “identify” me either by photo-lineup or otherwise.This interview alsocontains comments by Almond reciting her mother’s previous 6/2/87 and 6/30/87suggestions toHickey, which do not appear at all in any investigative interview or “therapy”notes about Almondprior to then.(b) The A-Ts give their own falsified accounts of the “PX encounter”. See A-TViolations exposingthis.(c) Contrary to Harvey’s narrative on page #26, there is no “FBI report” at ROIExhibit #1. Ratherthere is only the narrative of CID Agent Potter, which establishes that Almonddid not “identify” 123Acme. See A-T Violations, 123 section.Page 27 also refers to a 8/14/87 FBI interview of Almond. No such interviewappears as an exhibitto the ROI nor was provided to Plaintiff in Discovery with all relevant FBIinterviews.Page 27 also refers to the 2-years-later CID interviews of Almond, which are (a)neither “FBI”interviews nor reliable because of the elapsed time and the vested interest bythe A-Ts in continuing tocoach and reinforce Almond during that interval.412 Pages 58-59 merely repeat interpretations of the 8/13/87 FBI and 4/89 CIDinterviews.

Aquino, Plaintiffv.The Honorable Michael P.W. Stone, Secretary of the ArmyDepartment of the Army, Washington, D.C.,DefendantCivil Action No. 90-1547-ABrief in Support of Plaintiff’s ClaimStatus of the CaseOn November 15, 1990, Plaintiff filed a complaint seeking damages and adeclaratory judgment to amend the titling action and to remove Plaintiff’s namefromthe title block of United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC orCID) Report of Investigation (ROI) final “C” -0610-88-CID026-692595K3/6F3/6E7/6A1/5M2/5Y2/ DIMIS under 5 U.S.C. #552 a(g)(l)(A) & (C) of theAdministrative Procedure Act.The statute specifically provides for de novo judicial review. This HonorableCourt,therefore, is not limited to mere review of the agency action, but has thestatutoryauthority instead to examine the underlying factors which gave rise to theagencyaction and to make an independent determination of the propriety of the titlingaction.The parties have agreed to limit the attention of this Honorable Court to therecord,exhibits obtained through discovery, interrogatory answers, briefs and oralargument.Statement of FactsPlaintiff, then an active duty Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, wastitled by the CID on August 11, 1989 for “Conspiracy, Kidnapping, Sodomy,IndecentActs or Liberties with a Child, Indecent Acts, False Swearing, IntentionalNoncompliance with Article 30 - Uniform Code of Military Justice, Maltreatmentof aSubordinate and Conduct Unbecoming an Officer” (Defense Exhibit D).- 599 -Plaintiff sought to amend the titling action, and requested that Plaintiff’sname beremoved from the title block (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1). The CID granted relief inpart anddenied relief in part, keeping Plaintiff titled for “Conspiracy, Kidnapping,Sodomy,Indecent Acts, and False Swearing” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 4). The test for titlingis that of“probable cause” (AR 195-2, para. 4-4b).ArgumentThere is no probable cause to believe Plaintiff should be titled for anyoffense.“Probable Cause: Reasonable cause; having more evidence for than against. Areasonable ground for belief in the existence of facts warranting theproceedingscomplained of.” - Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, 1979This is a story about bias, fear, scapegoating, and political influenceconverging todestroy the life and career of a competent and dedicated Army officer who heldbeliefsincompatible with the American mainstream.That Plaintiff was an outstanding officer is not debated (Plaintiff’s Exhibit13). Thathe adopted Satanism as his religion is equally clear.In April of 1986 a little girl, age 2, named Kinsey Almond, was taken for thefirsttime to the Presidio Child Development Center (CDC) by her mother, Mrs. Adams-Thompson (Defense Exhibit G-1). Her father, an active-duty captain in theChaplain’sCorps, was a Presbyterian minister.Kinsey was a sporadic, infrequent visitor to the CDC during April, May, June,July,and August of 1986, attending a total of 13 times - only once in June (June10th) - andstaying for an undetermined number of hours, varying from three hours to sevenhoursand fifty minutes (Defense Exhibit G-1). Kinsey was not a regular, and there wasnocertainty as to when she would be there or how long she would stay.By September of 1986 Kinsey was three, and she went to a new class at the CDCheaded by a man named Gary Hambright. After several weeks Kinsey’s parents notedbehavioral changes in Kinsey. All was well before September.In the Fall of 1986 and Winter of 1987 she started telling her parents that shedidnot want to see Mr. Gary (New Defense Exhibit 15, not previously provided by theGovernment, attached hereto).By January of 1987 her parents took Kinsey to a psychiatrist out of concern forherbehavior.- 600 -The psychiatrist concluded on April 23, 1987:“From the sessions I have had with Kinsey to this date, I have concluded thatsheparticipated in and witnessed sexual and, at times, perverted activitiesinvolving anadult and herself and other children enrolled at the Center with her. I alsohaveconcluded that she has a great fear of a person at the school she identifiesas “Mr. Gary” and that “Mr. Gary” is the adult with whom Kinseyexperienced these activities.” (emphasis added)There is not the slightest mention of any person, to include Plaintiff,other than “Mr. Gary” . Not a hint of other adult involvement is made.An interview of the parents conducted by the FBI on January 26, 1987 confirmsthatthe Fall of 1986 was when Kinsey’s problems began (Defense Exhibit G-2).Although Kinsey had told her psychiatrist that she was raped and sodomized, amedical examination of this 3-year-old child in March of 1987 revealed noevidenceof physical abuse to either her vagina or rectum, and her hymen was intact(Defense Exhibit E-18, p. 5; Defense Exhibit E-38, therapist’s notes).The FBI, with the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), in January of 1987began a full-scale investigation of the Presidio CDC and Gary Hambright.Multiplechildren came forward to tell of abuse.Kinsey’s father knew Plaintiff and of Plaintiff’s belief in Satanism (DefenseExhibitE-12, p. 2).Kinsey’s mother kept a diary, which she says she copied, then lost the original.Defense Exhibit 42 is therefore what Kinsey’s mother says are copies of pagesfrom adiary kept by her contemporaneously with events. There is no proof that this istrue,and no ability to test the original for authenticity if such an original everexisted.Kinsey’s mother’s explanation of how she lost the diary is fascinating:“I originally kept my journal on scraps of notebook paper. In January 1989 Iphotographed my journal at the request of CPT Mark Harvey [CID militarycounsel]. Iwas so pleased how my journal looked after the loose notes were photocopied, Imayhave either misfiled or thrown away the original loose notes. Sometime in earlyAugust 1987 I recopied (by hand) some of the original notes onto loosepapers because they were not legible.” (emphasis added) (Defense Exhibit 13)- 601 -Plaintiff’s involvement in this case, brought on by Kinsey’s parents, beganAugust 12,1987. The notes have no credibility, and were probably done after Plaintiff wasinvolved.Nonetheless this “diary” starts on June 26, 1987, to suggest that Kinsey wasinvolvedwith two other persons named “Mikey” and “Shamby”; and on June 26, 1987 the“diary” says Kinsey’s conduct suggested the occult was part of Kinsey’s problem(Defense Exhibit E-42).Incredibly this circumstance is not developed, because Kinsey is sent off to hergrandparents on July 7, 1987 until August 9, 1987. The “diary” appears to stopfor thatmonth also, because Exhibit 42 is blank for that period. So it appears the“diary” wastailored to report on Kinsey or at least the mother’s perceptions of Kinsey.Interestingly, in the therapist’s notes at Defense Exhibit 38 for June 30, 1987,Kinsey’s mother told the therapist of “Mikey” and “Shamby” but said nothing oftheoccult. In fact the mother asked the therapist whether Satanic cults wereinvolved onJune 2, 1987 - fully 24 days before her allusion to the occult in her diary.This occurredin response to the therapist’s inquiry as to why Kinsey was talking about deadpeople,had said her neighbor Dr. Steve had spanked Mr. Gary, and had said Dr. Steve waswithMr. Gary at Mr. Gary’s house.If there were such great concern for the occult on June 26, 1987, why was it notraised with the therapist on June 30, 1987? It is incredible that such astartlingdiscovery would not have been revealed at that time, given the question asked onJune2, 1987.What is even more telling is this: On July 2, 1987 the therapist met withKinsey’smother alone, and there is no indication of Satanism or the occult in theconversation.But the therapist notes: “Met c mo. Pt talking c mo frequently now about events.Makeeping track.” The “keeping track” reference suggests that the procedure was anewevent.Kinsey went to her grandmother’s on July 7, 1987, returned on August 9, 1987,andsaw the therapist only on August 10, 1987. There was no mention of the occult.Thattherapy session closed with these notes:“Pt then said that I had “broken the lamp” and we needed to “talk about it”. Pt.beganto lecture me in a quiet controlled tone of voice and finally said “Honey, I’msorry butthis requires a spanking” and called Larry to “come up here” to give me aspanking.” (Defense Exhibit 38).- 602 -“Larry” is, of course, Kinsey’s father. The point is: At no time prior to August12,1987 did Kinsey’s mother reveal Kinsey’s supposed allusions to the occult to thetherapist.On August 12, 1987 Kinsey’s parents reported to the FBI that Kinsey identifiedPlaintiff and Plaintiff’s wife as “Mikey” and “Shamby” respectively, whileshopping atthe Presidio PX.No law enforcement agency ever attempted to investigate the identification sceneforcorroborating witnesses.On the 13th of August 1987 Kinsey’s parents gave a statement to the FBI (DefenseExhibit G-3) and to the SFPD August 14, 1987. Noteworthy is the fact thatKinsey’s father told the police the dates of the criminal conduct wereSeptember 1, 1986 to October 31, 1986 (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-D). Thisconformed to the statement made by Kinsey’s mother to the FBI onJanuary 26, 1987 (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-F).There is no evidence that Kinsey ever personally identified Plaintiff as “Mikey”toany law enforcement agency by photo, line-up, or otherwise during August,September,or October of 1987. Kinsey’s parents’ statement that Kinsey identified Plaintiffwas notcorroborated in any fashion to include Kinsey’s own identification.These alleged crimes were believed to have taken place outside the CDC, becausethechildren interviewed said they were taken to a house.The FBI sought an identification of the house lived in by Plaintiff. On August13,1987 Kinsey was taken to Plaintiff’s home in San Francisco. Although in theReport ofInvestigation (ROI) the CID says a positive identification was made (DefenseExhibit D,p. 7), the fact is that no identification was made.The FBI agent on the scene reported:“Approximately 10-15 feet before coming to the front of 123 Acme Avenue, Almondbegan to appear frightened and wanted to be held by her mother. Almond waspickedup by her mother but continued to stare at the front of 123 Acme Avenue.”(DefenseExhibit E-1).This is not an identification of anything. The mother knew the address, and sheknew her child. The “identification” is worthless.Additionally it should be noted that Kinsey identified the Plaintiff’s rentalcar as“Shamby’s” while doing the house identification, which, of course, wasimpossible -- 603 -since the car was not rented by Plaintiff in 1986 and neither Plaintiff nor hiswife everowned a red car. (Defense Exhibit E-1).The FBI and the SFPD thoroughly investigated the case, and on August 1, 1988 theSan Francisco District Attorney announced no charges would be filed againstPlaintiff.Prior to this time there was no active CID investigation of the Plaintiff.On October 26, 1988 Wayne Bowles from Senator Helms’ office complained to then-Secretary of the Army Marsh about Plaintiff.The letter is reproduced here in its entirety. (Original at Plaintiff’s Exhibit1-G):Jesse HelmsNorth CarolinaUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510October 26, 1988The Honorable John O. Marsh, Jr.Secretary of the ArmyDear Secretary Marsh:I am writing first as a citizen of the great nation of ours and secondly as anemployeeof our federal government, concerning a cancer in the military, specifically acancerwithin the Army.Last evening I viewed a program hosted by Geraldo Rivera on Satanism andWitchcraft. I was appalled to learn that a Colonel Aquino of the United StatesArmy wasa founder of the Temple of Set, a satanic cult. I believe he is stationed in St.Louis.To my view, this is disheartening. Here is a military man who has taken an oathtodefend God and country who practices a religion that is completely contrary tothe oathhe swore to uphold. If you or any member of your staff saw this telecast I amconfidentyour reaction was identical to mine.This individual should not be allowed to remain in the Army, his militaryservicerecord notwithstanding. I am respectful of any individual’s right to his firstamendmentprerogatives to worship. However, I cannot believe the Constitution is intendedtoprotect those individuals who have a belief system that espouses the killing andsacrificeof infants and the ritual torturing of children.I would appreciate your looking into the existence of satanic worship in theArmyand it’s [sic] adherents. Perhaps it may be necessary to hold Congressionalhearings toconsider appropriate legislation in this matter.Kindest regards,Sincerely,/s/ Wayne Ronald Boyles, IIILegislative Assistant to Senator Jesse Helms- 604 -The Army recognized that Bowles was simply a surrogate for the Senator byresponding directly to Senator Helms and bypassing Bowles in a letter ofDecember 8,1988. This letter represents a rational constitutional standard (Plaintiff’sExhibit 1-H).Helms decided to keep the heat on the Army, and on January 9, 1989 wrote aletterto the Secretary of the Army. This letter is also included in its entirety.(Original atExhibit 1-I):Jesse HelmsNorth CarolinaUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510January 9, 1989Dear Jack:Except for two or three trips back to Washington, I’ve been working out of ourRaleigh office since the Senate adjourned in late October. Yesterday in goingthrough astack of material sent to me in Raleigh, I ran across a December 27 clippingfrom TheWashington Times about a Lt. Col. Michael Aquino who identifies himself as a“Satanist” and who claims that this is his “religion”.Either the man needs psychiatric help, or the Army doesn’t need him. The factthathe has twice appeared on national television seems to me to demonstrate that hedoesn’t have all four wheels on the ground.This is not a matter of freedom of religion. Satanism is not a religion.I tried yesterday to reach you at your home through the White House switchboard,but learned that you are in Germany. When you get back, would you give me aring?Maybe there’s something I missed in translation, but I do not understand how theArmydecided to “stand by” Colonel Aquino - if indeed the newspaper account isaccurate.The most charitable thing that can be said of the colonel is that he is a nut.If that isthe case, I might have some sympathy for him but I still do not believe that heshould be“handling budgets” for the Army Reserve Personnel Center - or anywhere else.PerhapsI am dismayed at his arrogance as much as anything else.In any event, please let me have the Army’s side of it - and I sure wouldappreciate acall from you.Sincerely,/s/ JesseThe Judge Advocate General of the Army physically met with Senator Helms todiscuss the Aquino matter in late January or early February of 1989 afterdiscussionwith the Secretary of the Army (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-J).In response to Plaintiff’s request for letters sent to the Army by Helms, Helmssought refuge behind the Senate’s Legal Counsel (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-K).- 605 -By November 9, 1988 the Army was already taking action on the Helms surrogateletter (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-L).On November 23, 1988 the CID began its investigation. There is no evidence thattheCID had any interest in investigating the Plaintiff from August 1, 1988 - thedate SanFrancisco publicly stated no charges would be brought - until November 23, 1988.Theinvestigation did not get into full swing until March of 1989.At Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2, p. 27 is Defendant’s interrogatory answer as to whythe CIDinitiated the investigation. The CID tells us that the FBI and SFPDinvestigation weredeficient. Here is an extremely-high-profile case which is on television and onnewspapers daily, and the CID wants this Honorable Court to believe the FBI andtheSFPD did not do their job.By March of 1989 the investigation was clearly stale. Plaintiff nonethelesscooperated fully with the investigation, including allowing an interview in hishome inSt. Louis, where he and Lilith Aquino answered all questions propounded by theCID.The Army apparently did not expect Plaintiff’s cooperation, as is evidenced bythememorandum at Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-M.It is significant that at no time did Plaintiff fail to be responsive toreasonableinquiries made by the CID.On November 29, 1988 a high-level meeting at the Pentagon was held to discusstheAquino matter, including the following persons: TJAG, ODCSPER, DACH, PA, OCLL,M&RA, GC (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-N).There can be little doubt that the Army adopted a policy of appeasement in itsdealings with Senator Helms. Plaintiff was expendable. The solution was twofold:namely to deny Plaintiff continuation as an AGR officer, and to title Plaintiffwithoutever charging him. The way to accomplish that was to allow the Statute ofLimitationsto run prior to the titling, and to use the Statute of Limitations as an excuseforavoiding a public trial that surely would end in an acquittal.The test for continuation as an AGR officer was merely “fully qualified”, whichPlaintiff was without doubt (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-M, p. 7-9, memo from LTC JohnBurton). But when the Continuation Board improperly asked if Plaintiff wereflagged,as such a question falls outside the Board’s proper review, and was improperlytold“yes, due to the investigation” (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-M, p. 4), Plaintiff wasdenied(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 10).The CID had ample opportunity to finish its investigation and get Plaintifftitled longbefore the Statute of Limitations ran.- 606 -In a phone conversation with military counsel to the CID, Counsel for Plaintifflearned that the Army had decided not to charge Plaintiff before the titlingactionwas completed. Assuming the accuracy of the representation, why then proceedwitha titling action?There is only one available answer, and that lies in the interplay between theArmyand Senator Helms. The titling action for such heinous crimes effectivelydestroyedPlaintiff’s career and labeled him for life. Helms was satisfied.By knowingly allowing the Statute to run, there was an excuse for noprosecution,and no chance for Plaintiff’s vindication in a public forum.Knowing that the matter would not be prosecuted gave the CID license to say orconclude whatever they wished.By the time the CID got involved, all relevant allegations pointed to the Fallof 1986 in San Francisco for the alleged abuse of Kinsey.But when the CID discovered that they could not fit the Satanist Plaintiff intothatFall because Plaintiff was not in San Francisco, the CID - with Kinsey’sparents’ silentconcurrence - created a new scenario and a new time frame.Since Plaintiff was on leave and in San Francisco from June 3, 1986 to July 18,1986,the CID and Harvey did this:“Further investigation shifted the time of Almond’s kidnapping from CDC from theFall of 1986 to June-July 1986. This change was based on the CDC records and thecanceled checks maintained by Mrs. Adams-Thompson.” (Defense Exhibit D-1, p.56).Neither the CDC records nor the checks could form a basis for shifting the focusofthe investigation. The records and checks just show that the child was at theday carecenter in June, July, August, September and October of 1986. They are passiverecords.There is no dynamic associated with them that allows one to conclude June-Julywaspreferable to September-October.The “shift” is unsupported. The lack of support is of no moment, however,becausethe investigation missed critical exculpatory evidence which was readilydiscoverableby the investigators but which they chose not to pursue.The investigators were told that in the June-July period Plaintiff hadsubstantialwork done on the interior and exterior of his home at 123 Acme, San Francisco,“thecrime scene” and the place where Kinsey was allegedly abused. (Defense ExhibitD-1, p.26) Plaintiff delivered to the the investigators the names, addresses, andtelephone- 607 -numbers of the artisans who worked at the home and the property contiguous toit, alsoowned by Plaintiff.The CID followed certain of these leads and ignored others. Those that werefollowed were followed only for the limited purpose of seeking inculpatoryevidence(Report P. 70, 71, and 95). No attempt was made to seek exculpatory evidence,but suchexculpatory evidence was there among the ignored.Plaintiff has the absolute defense of alibi for the June-July time period.E. Graham Marshall was a painter in San Francisco who was hired by Plaintiff intheSpring of 1986 to paint first the interior and then the exterior of the allegedcrimescene, 123 Acme, San Francisco, California. (Graham Marshall’s affidavit isattached asPlaintiff’s Exhibit 1-A).Kinsey was at the CDC on the following dates in June and July of 1986: June 10;July 2, 9, 11, 17. This information comes from the checks Kinsey’s mother wroteto theCDC (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6).What is critical to understand is that June 10, 1986 became the focus of theentireinvestigation. Kinsey had told investigators that other children had been withher in the“house”. The only date Kinsey and the children named were together at the CDCduringthe time Plaintiff was in San Francisco was June 10, 1986.In every CID status report provided by the government, the only date named fortheoffenses alleged is June 10, 1986 (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 5). There is absolutelynoconsideration of another date by the CID.On June 10, 1986 E. Graham Marshall, the painter from San Francisco, as was hispractice, went to Plaintiff’s home, the alleged crime scene, to work on theinterior. Thisis what happened from Marshall’s affidavit (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1-A):22. I specifically and distinctly recall being at 123 Acme on June 10, 1986.a. One June 10, 1986 I specifically recall staining cabinets in the observationroom. These cabinets were stained a dark color.b. I arrived between 7:45 and 9:00 AM as usual.c. Since June 10, 1986 was a completion day, I did not go to lunch.d. After completion of final touch-up, including cabinet and window sill work,Michael Aquino and I discussed a proposal for work to be performed on theexteriors of 121 and 123 Acme.e. I did not leave the premises until after 4:00 PM.23. At no time whatsoever did I see any children enter or leave 123 Acme on June10,1986.- 608 -Marshall remembers June 10, 1986 because of the exterior contract he typed thatevening, then signed, dated, and delivered to Respondent on June 11, 1986followinghis completion day June 10, 1986. (Exhibits II and III of the Affidavit)Marshall’s affidavit clearly states that Marshall was at Plaintiff’s home, theallegedcrime scene, every day that Kinsey was at the CDC in July. On this point hisAffidavit isclear: There were no children. There was no crime committed by Plaintiff.In addition the checks show rather clearly that Kinsey was an infrequent visitortothe CDC and that her stays varied in time. What the CID wants this HonorableCourt tobelieve is that Plaintiff, in concert with Gary Hambright, took this child, whoin Junewas not in his class, from the CDC, not knowing when she would be there and notknowing how long she would stay, molested her in Plaintiff’s home, andsuccessfullyreturned her to the CDC without anyone knowing that she, Gary Hambright, orotherchildren were gone.Now, of course, the CID had to deal with Graham Marshall’s Affidavit. AtPlaintiff’sExhibit 13 is the titling opinion from the Army’s Office of the Judge Advocatewhichserved as the basis to find that there was no probable cause to title Mrs.Aquino, thePlaintiff’s wife, notwithstanding the fact that Kinsey had positively, at leastaccordingto her parents (Defense Exhibit E-42, August 12, 1987; Defense Exhibit E-12),identified Mrs. Aquino as “Shamby”.One line is devoted to the Affidavit: “The evidence of alibi offered by LTCAquino isnot persuasive.”No, and why not? The only investigation the CID did to confirm the Affidavit isaphone call from the CID’s lawyer to Graham Marshall at Plaintiff’s Exhibit 7.This transcript created a new problem for the CID. The alibi held up. Marshallwasthere in Aquino’s home on June 10, 1986 for the entire day, and he never did seeanykids.For the second time in this scarred and disgraceful investigation, the CIDconformednew-found facts to the desired result.Plaintiff’s home had an apartment on the first floor. Plaintiff’sbrother-in-law, aNavy Commander, lived there. The apartment had never been searched by the FBI,SFPD or CID. There was never a hint that the apartment could be the crime scene.Thepictures at Defense Exhibit E-3 taken by the government were of Plaintiff’s homein theupper floors.- 609 -Now, after three years of investigation, with Plaintiff already titled, the CIDlawyersuggests to Marshall at page 7 of the transcript that Plaintiff could have takenchildreninto the Plaintiff’s brother-in-law’s apartment without Marshall’s knowledge.Marshallsaid, “It’s conceivable.”Based on that statement the Army concluded that the alibi was “not persuasive”.Now, of course, the crime scene is Bill Butch’s apartment. For an exhaustivediscussion of the 1991 version of the crime scene, see Defendant’s Answers toInterrogatories at Plaintiff’s Exhibit 2, p. 4-6. Everyone should have known itall along.But, as is usual in sloppy, incompetent, and preconceived result-directedinvestigations, the CID failed again to investigate.If the CID had investigated by contacting Bill Butch, Plaintiff’sbrother-in-law, theCID would have discovered what Bill Butch always knew. Butch’s apartment lookednothing like what the children described. Beyond that, Bill Butch worked allnight onJune 10, 1986, went home, went to bed, and got up in the afternoon. He never sawanychildren at the Plaintiff’s home. Defense Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Bill Butch.So lightly regarded was the apartment during the investigation that Bill Butchwasnever interviewed by the FBI, the SFPD, or the CID.Beyond all of the above, there is no evidence of any kind in the ROI thatPlaintiffknew or had any association with Hambright.Kinsey was under Hambright’s control only in September and October of1986. During June and July she had another teacher (Defense Exhibit 1-B).Plaintiffwas not in San Francisco during September-October 1986. This clearly exculpatoryinformation is knowingly excluded from the ROI.In June, how did Hambright get this child out of someone else’s class? There isnoexplanation.The CID said at Defense Exhibit D-1, p. 26 of the ROI: “The number of times thatAlmond received care at the CDC in the Fall of 1986 is irrelevant, because LTCAquinowas out of the State of California the majority of the Fall of 1986.” If thisstatement istrue, then why does all the evidence point to the Fall time frame, and why isthere no evidence that anything happened or could have happened beforeSeptember 1, 1986?The inescapable truth of the matter is that once the investigators discoveredthat an alibi defense existed for the Fall of 1986, they attempted to contort- 610 -the truth, with Kinsey’s parents’ support, to gain a result not supported byfact.What is telling is found in Defense Exhibit D-1, p. 8 of the ROI.“During the course of this investigation, no child who attended the PSF CDC andwasinterviewed, with the exception of Almond, identified either LTC or Mrs. Aquinoas oneof their assailants (paragraph 4, 7, and 8 this report).“During the course of this investigation, no child who was interviewedidentified 123Acme Ave., SF, CA from a photographic line-up as a location to which they hadbeentaken (paragraph 8 and 9, this report).” (Emphasis Added).The CID and Major Harvey rely upon interviews of Almond in April of 1989 tosubstantiate the titling action. This child was three years old in 1986, andafter morethan two years the CID is willing to accept what she says about events thatoccurred in1986 as though those events happened yesterday. Not only is her memory utterlysuspect under such a circumstance, as her conflicting statements demonstrate,but alsoshe has had an opportunity to see pictures of Plaintiff and to be influenced byherparents and others.The ultimate reality is that Kinsey’s parents were the moving force in thisentirematter. They now have a claim filed with the government for $1.5 million onbehalf ofKinsey and $1.5 million on behalf of themselves.ConclusionThere is not the slightest hint of probable cause to title Plaintiff.Respectfully submitted,/s/ Gary R. MyersAttorney for PlaintiffMay 16, 1991- 611 -Appendix 66: TJAG/CID District Court Brief Statements AnalysisFalse Official Statements by Major Patrick Lisowski inMemorandum in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on theRecordU.S. District Court, Eastern District of VirginiaCase #90-1547-A- identified as of December 16, 1991 by Lt.Col. Michael A. Aquino -Page 3:#4. On August 12, 1987 Kinsey was at the Presidio Post Exchange (PX) withher parents. At about 4:00 PM, as they walked through the store, Kinsey ranto her parents, frightened, and told them that she had seen “Mikey” from “Mr.Gary’s house”. Kinsey’s mother picked her up, and Kinsey pointed at theplaintiff, LTC Michael Aquino, and identified him as “Mikey”. Kinsey said shewas afraid and wanted to leave the store. CPT Adams-Thompson recognizedLTC Aquino from his prior assignment at the Presidio. He took Kinsey fromMrs. Adams-Thompson and carried her out of the store to the parking lot.When the Aquinos exited the store, Kinsey identified Mrs. Aquino as“Shamby”, another person who she saw with “Mr. Gary”. After returninghome, Kinsey said that she was afraid that “Mikey” and “Shamby” wouldcome to her home and hurt her.1.The supposed “PX encounter” is here presented as established fact, whenLisowski knows that in August 1987 the “details” of Kinsey Almond’spresence and supposed actions were merely unsubstantiated/uncorroborated [by Almond or anyone else] allegations by Lawrence andMichele Adams-Thompson (A-T). All that is established fact is that Mrs.Aquino and I were at the PX and that one or both of the adult A-Ts saw usthere, that this took place after it had been decided to merchandiseAlmond as a “victim” in the ongoing Presidio scam, and after Michelehad already introduced the subject of Satanism (6/2/87) and insinuationsconcerning me (6/30/87) into her discussions with Debbie Hickey.2.The adult A-Ts offered at least three conflicting and inconsistent versionsof what Almond is supposed to have said in the PX [see enclosed list of A-T Violations of Article #133 UCMJ, Section C]. This in itself discredits thiseffort by them as obviously manufactured on the spur of the moment andrevised thereafter to try to adjust to inconvenient facts as they emerged.- 612 -3.The version that Almond “told her parents that she had seen ‘Mikey’ from‘Mr. Gary’s house’ was invented by Michele for her statement to FBIagent Foreman on 8/13/87. One day later Lawrence A-T gave twocompletely different versions to the CID and the SFPD [A-T Violations#44-46].4.In none of the preexisting versions of what Almond said or did at the PXwas it said that “Kinsey’s mother picked her up and she pointed at Lt.Col.Aquino”. This is a new fabrication in this brief by Lisowski.5.The supposed statement by Almond that “she was afraid and wanted toleave the store” was not invented until Lawrence A-T’s 4/10/89 interviewwith the CID - over 1-1/2 years after the PX encounter date.6.“When the Aquinos exited the store, Kinsey identified Mrs. Aquino as‘Shamby’, another person who she saw with ‘Mr. Gary’.” This allegedidentification is demolished in A-T Violations #50-59.7.“Shambee” (Hickey’s spelling)• appears in the Hickey notes first on 1/27/87, introduced by Almond as“her friend at school” who was spanked by Mr. Rogers on TV. Almondadded that Shambee “also had its neck broken”, indicating that“Shambee” is either an imaginary “friend” or perhaps a doll.• There is no record of the FBI/SFPD/CID interviewing either teachers orother children at the Presidio day-care center to see if anyone used orwas known by the name “Shambee”.• There is no mention of “Shambee” by any other child.• On 4/7/87 Almond said that Shambee and Sassy were the same person,and that Sassy was Todo’s girlfriend. After this neither Almond norHickey used the name “Shambee” anymore, discussing only “Sassy”.• “Shambee” is reintroduced as “Mikey’s wife” by Michele A-T on6/30/87.• On 7/7/87 Almond told Hickey that “Nancy and Shambee were goodmothers”• On 7/7/87 Hickey asked Almond if Shambee worked at the school.Almond’s answer - and anything else she may have said as a follow-up- 613 -on the next three pages of Hickey’s record - has been concealed bythe CID.8.Almond’s “statement after returning home” is again only an allegation bythe adult A-Ts, not established fact as stated here by Lisowski.Pages 3-4. #5. FBI Agent Foreman interviewed Kinsey at 9PM the next day, August13th. She told him that “Mikey wears Army clothes like my daddies [sic]” andthat “Mikey” put his penis into her mouth, bottom, and vagina just like “Mr.Gary”.1.This is not substantiated by any entry concerning “Mikey” in the Hickeynotes until 6/30/87, following Michele A-T’s introduction of the idea of a“Satanic cult” to Hickey on 6/2/87.2.On 6/30/87 it is Michele, not Almond, who introduces “Mikey” toHickey, alleging that “Mikey is Shambee’s husband”. Michele then allegesto Hickey that Almond told her that “Mikey wore an ‘Army suit’ with astripe on the pants”. None of these allegations by Michele were checkedby Hickey in her 6/30 direct questioning of Almond, and Almond herselfmade no mention of any of them during the session.3.To Hickey - inconsistent with the Foreman interview - Almond said thatMikey “put his penis in her mouth and peed on her, and put poo-poo inher mouth”. During all of the preceding sessions she had made the samestatements concerning (a) Hambright, (b) “little boys”, (c) all of thechildren at “the house”, (d) Sassy, (e) Todo, (f) the cross, (g) the bible, (h)the female doll, (i) the penis in the pot hanging from the ceiling with armsand legs in it, and (j) Dr. Steve.Page 4.#5. Kinsey told her mother that “Mikey” was the “blood man” because he hadput blood on her and licked it off.1.This alludes to Michele A-T’s 8/13/87 statement to Foreman, notAlmond’s.2.The elaboration “because he had put blood on her and licked it off” is notin that Michele A-T 8/13/87 statement.3.Calling “Mikey” the “blood man” is not in any of the Hickey notes, eitherby Almond or by Michele. Clearly it was a later invention by Michele.- 614 -Page 4.#5. Mrs. A-T also recalled that Kinsey had described “Mikey” as having“eyebrows that went up”.1.Again this is from the Michele interview, not the Almond one. All itindicates is that Michele knew what I looked like after seeing me at thePresidio and in the PX.2.Lisowski tries to create the impression that everything in paragraph #5 ofhis brief was from direct statements of Almond to Foreman. As shownhere, this is not the case at all.Page 4.#6. In addition to the identification at the PX …1.Again, there are only the allegations of the two adult A-Ts that Almondever “identified” me at the PX, or was even there at all. Lisowski suggeststhat this “Almond PX identification” is established fact.Page 4.#6. Kinsey identified plaintiff out of a five-person photo lineup and videolineup.1.When? Only 1-1/2 years later during the CID 4/7-8/89 interview, afterAlmond had certainly been exposed to my picture and video imageendlessly by her parents, therapist(s), investigator(s), and anyone elsewith an interest in furthering the scam.2.During the St. Louis interview of us in May 1989, the CID showed us thephoto-lineup used. It contains several other persons besides me, none ofwhom has either my distinctive widow’s peak nor distinctive upturnedeyebrows. Some had beards and mustaches. My photo was placed in thedirect center of the lineup. Under such circumstances, such a “photolineup” is so staged as to be worthless.3.The lineup was in explicit violation of CID regulation 195-1, which statesthat:• “a lineup is appropriate when … the witness does not know the identityof the perpetrator …”• “the persons portrayed in the photographs should be reasonably similarin appearance.”• “there should be three or more viewings with the positions of thephotographs varied each time.”- 615 -• “The special agent conducting the photo lineup will identify in the ROInarrative which photographs were used, their positions in the lineup,and the results.”• All of these CIDR 195-1 requirements were violated in this case. Wherethe “ROI narrative” is concerned, the only discussion - which does notmeet the above requirements - is on pages #101-2 of the ROI.4.Since in the same CID interview Almond failed to “identify” either Mrs.Aquino (about whom the adult A-Ts alleged she had been so certain at thePX) or 123 Acme (which was supposed to “terrify” her), what does this sayabout the value of any “lineup identification” of me?Pages 4-5. #7. After Kinsey’s interview she was taken to the vicinity ofplaintiff’shouse, which is about two miles, a seven-minute drive from the CDC. G.E.D-5 (Crime Scene Examination) at 65. Accompanied by her mother and twoinvestigators, and starting about one and a half blocks from plaintiff’s house,Kinsey walked down the street where plaintiff lives. Upon approachingplaintiff’s house, Kinsey appeared to be frightened and asked to be held byher mother. After being picked up she continued to stare at the front of 123Acme Avenue, where plaintiff lived. Kinsey said that the area was familiarand she had been there before. When asked if this was “Mr. Gary’s” house,she answered yes, and stated that “Mr. Gary” had driven her there, whereshe met “Mikey” and “Shamby”. G.E. E-1 (SA Potter’s Report); G.E. D-4(Interview of Victim) at 59.1.The supposed “123 Acme Avenue identification trip” is demolished initems #60-72 of A-T Violations.Page 5.#8. Captain A-T reported the PX identification and Kinsey’s statements to theSan Francisco Police Department (SFPD), and, based on this evidence, amagistrate determined that probable cause existed to issue a search warrantfor the top apartment at 123 Acme Avenue, plaintiff’s residence. G.E. D-5(Crime Scene Examination) at 65, G.E. E-5 (SFPD Incident Report datedAugust 14, 1987, following Aquino statement dated January 4, 1988). Duringthe search the FBI photographed the interior of the apartment and someweapons, masks, and ceremonial items observed there. G.E. E-3. The threeother apartments in the house and the house next door at 121 Acme Avenuewere not searched, although later investigation disclosed that plaintiff ownedboth buildings G.E. D-19 at 119.- 616 -1.The search warrant specified 123 Acme, not merely the “top apartment”.The SFPD, the CID, and the FBI could have search the entire building thatnight. I specifically asked them if they wanted to, and they declined.2.The other premises at 123 and 121 Acme were all leased to tenants at thetime. The SFPD/FBI/CID made no effort to see these premises nor tointerview any of the tenants throughout the investigation.3.The fact that “weapons, masks, and ceremonial items” were observed inour home is irrelevant. Many if not most homes contain [like ours] one ormore legal firearms - particularly homes of professional military families.Commercial Halloween-style masks are also neither unusual nor“evidence”, nor is it unusual for a religious official to have “ceremonialitems” in his home. What is relevant and pertinent is that in none of theHickey sessions did Almond discuss or mention either “masks” or“ceremonial items”.4.“Weapons, masks, and/or ceremonial items” were not identified in thesearch warrant as relevant to the investigation.5.No “weapons, masks, or ceremonial items” were confiscated in the search.6.These three “sinister images” are clearly introduced into the brief byLisowski only for dramatic effect.Page 5.#9. Although Kinsey’s reactions to the photographs are not conclusive, thephotographs do show a number of items that corroborate Kinsey’s and theother children’s descriptions of the house where they were taken: (1) masks,(2) guns, (3) toy animals or dinosaurs, (4) a lion picture on the wall and lionson the Egyptian throne, (5) a computer, (6) cameras, (7) a black room withsoft walls, and (8) a robot. G.E. E-38 (Excerpts of Kinsey’s medical records)at 31, 32, 38; G.E. D-14 at 109; G.E. D-2 at 22.1.“Kinsey’s reactions to the photographs are not conclusive …”:• The FBI did not show Almond any photos of other buildings or interiorsother than 123.• Almond made no identifications at all from the photos. When shemade a comment about a photo in one of the two sessions, it was eithercontradicted or invalidated by her comment or lack of one concerningthe identical photo in the other session.- 617 -• Almond asked the FBI agent if the photos were of his house!• Almond noticed items in the photos which didn’t even exist until afterOctober 1986.• During the same session Almond identified “sisters” of hers who did notexist, despite Michele’s hasty effort to coach her through a revisedresponse.2.“Masks”: Discussed above. Also a generic staple of all “Satanic childmolestation” scams nationwide by this time.3.“Guns”: Discussed above. Also a generic staple of the scams.4.“Toy animals or dinosaurs”: Almond never mentioned toy animals[except the ones she was playing with in Hickey’s office]. Neither were“toy animals” mentioned in the Hickey, Michele, or Lawrence A-Tallegations.5.“A lion picture on the wall and lions on the Egyptian throne”: On 8/13/87Almond told FBI agent Foreman that the house had “a bathtub with lion’sfeet”. She made no other mention of lions whatever, in any context.• As the search verified, our bathtub does not have lion’s feet [or feet ofany kind].• Attempts to stretch “a bathtub with lion’s feet” into anything whateverwith lions on it in our residence are fraudulent and a deliberate attemptto obstruct justice by concealing exculpatory evidence (the actual designof our bathtub) and manufacturing false “evidence”.• This attempt to manufacture “evidence” is all the more significantbecause, of this entire list of “relevant items”, only “a bathtub withlion’s feet” was actually mentioned by Almond to Foreman on 8/13/87.She mentioned none of the other items to him.6.“A computer”: Not mentioned by Almond to Foreman on 8/13/87 noralleged by Lawrence A-T to the SFPD on 8/14/87. As with legal weapons,personal computers are a common feature of many, if indeed not mosthomes today.7.“Cameras”: Again an item generic to almost every home.- 618 -8.“A black room with soft walls”: As with the lion-theme above, an attemptby Lisowski to manufacture evidence by deliberately distorting facts.• In the 5/18/87 Hickey notes Almond said that she saw “a cross and itwas a bad one that went peepee”.• On 8/14/87 Lawrence A-T changed this into “a living room with blackwalls and a cross on the ceiling” to make it sound less ridiculous to theSFPD.• When the SFPD searched our home, they found the living room wasbeige and had no cross on the ceiling. Our bedroom was black/silver/red, but is only big enough for our bed, could not be mistaken for a“living room”, and also contains no cross on the ceiling, white orotherwise, “peepeeing” or otherwise.• After the A-Ts learned that the little room on our roof has upholsteredwalls (not in black!), Michele forged an entry in her diary to make itsound as though Almond had said something about “a room with softwalls” before the date of the raid. The marginal location of the diarynotation, and the different writing instrument obviously used, reveal theforgery.• Lisowski’s manipulation of all of this into “a black room with soft walls”appears for the first time in this brief.9.“A Robot”: Not mentioned in the search warrant. Not mentioned byAlmond. Nor, as far as I know, mentioned by any other child in thePresidio “abuse” scam.Pages 5-6. #10. One of the items seized by the SFPD during the search was anotebook.G.E. D-5 at 65. That notebook contained the name “Mike Todo”. G.E. D-14 at109. Kinsey and another child mentioned “Todo” as one of the persons at “Mr.Gary’s” house. G.E. D-19 at 120. During an April 7, 1987 interview with MAJHickey, months before the PX identification, Kinsey stated that “Shamby”and “Sassy” were the same person, and that “Sassy” was “Todo’s” girlfriend.G.E. D-2 at 21, G.E. E-38 (as numbered at page bottom).1.One page from Mrs. Aquino’s telephone notebook contained a list ofnames and telephone numbers, one of which was for a “Mike Todo”. AsMrs. Aquino explained to the CID in her May 1989 interview, that page ofthe notebook contained a list of persons and their telephone numbers who- 619 -called in answer to an ad in the San Francisco Chronicle for rental of oneof the 121 Acme flats. The flat was eventually rented to someone else.2.We never met this “Todo”, and apparently Mrs. Aquino spoke to him onlyonce on the phone. In the CID interview she suggested that the CID tracehim through the phone number he gave - and for that matter verify thenature of the list by calling the other persons on it.3.The CID responded that Todo’s phone number was disconnected, butapparently they made no effort whatever to trace him through telephonecompany records, or for that matter to verify the flat-rental-ad nature ofthe list with any of the other names on it.4.Kinsey Almond’s statements to Hickey concerning “Todo” and “Sassy” areso incoherent and inconsistent as to be worthless:• Almond said Sassy had blonde hair (4/7/87), then that Sassy had“black hair like Hickey” (who has brown hair) (4/28/87), then thatSassy had blonde hair again (5/12/87).• Almond said Sassy “had yellow eyes like Hickey” (who has green eyes)(4/28/87).• Almond switched Sassy’s name to “Cathy” (5/12/87), then back again to“Sassy” in the same session.• Said Sassy and Todo were white and had blonde hair (4/7/87), thenthat Sassy had “black hair like Hickey” (who has brown hair) and Todohad green hair (4/28/87).• Said Sassy and Todo lived [at the house] and then said that they didn’t(4/7/87).• Said Sassy and Todo had “two” toys, then said they had “all kinds of”toys (4/7/87).• Said Sassy and Todo had “dinosaurs that bite and hurt” (4/7/87).• Said Sassy “had yellow eyes like Hickey” (who has green eyes)(4/28/87).• On 4/7/87 said that she went to Sassy & Todo’s house. On 5/12/87 saidthat the lady’s name was Cathy and that it was her house (no mention ofTodo).- 620 -Pages 6-7. #12: Based upon these sworn charges against CPT A-T and otherstatements made by plaintiff as the investigation continued, CID investigatedplaintiff for false swearing. Specifically, plaintiff falsely stated that Kinseywas two years old in October 1986 when she was in fact three. G.E. E-5, G.E.D-1 at 10. Plaintiff admitted that he incorrectly stated Kinsey’s age, butclaimed it was a mistake. G.E. D-6 at 72.1.None of the exhaustive statements and evidence that I presented in thetwo sworn charge packets were ever refuted, for the simple reason that, asthe CID records themselves reveal, they were never investigated bythe UCMJ authority at all in violation of the Manual for Courts-Martial. It is clear that from the beginning the CID used the chargepackets only to see if they could find some technicality somewhere - suchas my mistake concerning Almond’s age - to use to frame a case againstme.2.The only discrepancy found was my reference to Almond as “2” at a timewhen she was “3”. As explained to the CID during the May 1989 interview,when they first brought this to my attention, A-T’s attack on me came inAugust 1987 when the child was 3. Since the time period he specified(September-October 1986) was almost a year previously, I assumed thatAlmond had been age 2 at that time. It simply did not occur to me tocheck her exact birthdate and note that it was precisely at the September 1turning-point. I can perhaps be forgiven for having no knowledge of orinterest in Almond whatever until her parents suddenly attacked my wifeand myself in August 1987. Nor does the distinction between 2-11/12 yearsand 3-1/12 years of age strike me as chronologically significant. Also as anenclosure to my charges and sworn statements I included a copy of theSFPD Incident Report, which of course contained Almond’s birthdate.Page 7.#12. Plaintiff also stated that he had “never used or been known by thenickname ‘Mikey’”. G.E. D-5 at 2. In addition to the children’s identificationofhim as “Mikey”, however, Mr. Anton LaVey, a friend and associate, referredto plaintiff as “Mikey”. G.E. D-2 at 37, G.E. D-7 at 85.1.I have never been known by or used the nickname “Mikey”, Even as ayoung child, my nickname was “Archy” (to distinguish me from my father,Michael Sr.). The diploma of my graduation from Town School for Boys,San Francisco shows “Archy Ford-Aquino”, as do all of my yearbooks, etc.at that elementary school.- 621 -2.According to SFPD investigator Glenn Pamfiloff, not one child of all theones he interviewed during his investigation of the A-T allegationsidentified me.3.Kinsey Almond herself never “identified” me until the April 1989 CIDinterview, by which time her recognition of a photo of me was academicbecause of coaching and prior exposure.4.Anton LaVey is not by any stretch of imagination a “friend and associate”.LaVey referred to me as “Mikey” to the CID only because, since I exposedhis financial exploitation of the Church of Satan in 1975, he hates meintensely and has made it repeatedly and publicly clear that he does.• I retain on file all of my correspondence with him prior to 1975. The onlyfirst names he ever used therein was “Michael” and occasionally “Mike”.• By the time LaVey was interviewed by the CID, the “Mikey” allegationsof A-T had been all over the San Francisco news media. Because of hisinterest in and hatred for Mrs. Aquino and myself, LaVey simply tailoredhis responses to try to harm us. His attitude of hatred was so obvious tothe CID agent (SA Cates) interviewing him that Cates remarked “Hecertainly doesn’t like you very much!” to me later.• LaVey is a habitual and deliberate liar, who routinely falsifies anythingof convenience to him. See in particular the exposé of numerous LaVeyfalsehoods in Rolling Stone #612 (9/5/91) and also the court papers andjudicial findings in Hegarty v. LaVey (San Francisco County SuperiorCourt #SCV-891863).Page 7.#12. Plaintiff made other statements controverted by evidence, including thatonly three people had access to the security code to his upper apartment andthat he had never been to the CDC.1.I made no “other statements controverted by evidence”. [And only myincidental mistake concerning Almond’s age was incorrect - a single,immaterial error amidst thousands of pages of letters and statements towhich I have signed my name concerning the A-T attack.]2.Only three persons who lived at or checked on 123 Acme/Upper - Mrs.Aquino, her brother, and myself - had the security code to our flat.Obviously National Guardian Security Systems - the company whichinstalled and monitored the system - did too. That is all.- 622 -3.I have not in fact ever been to the CDC. There is no physical evidence tothe contrary, nor statement from any adult (parent, CDC worker, otherperson) to the contrary. During the Presidio scam prior to the A-T attackon us, no child ever mentioned me, my name, or even a description ofanyone like me. “Identifications” and “remembered sightings” after the A-T attack became a media circus mean nothing.Page 7.#13. On August 12, 1988 the San Francisco district attorney’s office closed itsinvestigation of child abuse at the CDC.1.In the ROI the CID said “In September 1988 SFPD terminated activeinvestigation.” I confronted CID Commanding General Cromartie withthis lie in my 11/30/89 letter to him. So now Lisowski quietly moves it to8/12?2.8/12 is still a lie. It is cited to try to narrow the inconvenient gap betweenthe closing of the SFPD investigation and the Geraldo Rivera/SenatorHelms-driven opening of the CID investigation. In fact the actual datewhen the SFPD District Attorney’s Office announced that no chargeswould be filed against me was 8/1/88.Page 7.#13. In September 1988 CID investigators met with representatives from theSFPD, etc. to discuss the status of the investigation.1.What “investigation”? The SFPD one had been closed over a monthearlier. The CID one would not be opened until late November.Page 7.#14. On October 17, 1988, at the request of CID Special Agent Penaluna, thelocal Army investigator, MAJ Mark Harvey drafted an Investigation Planfor plaintiff’s case. The memorandum discussed plans for continuing theinvestigation of plaintiff in light of the completion of the SFPD investigationand the perceived weaknesses of that investigation. G.E. G-3 (CIDInvestigative Plan).1.The letter authored by Major Harvey at G.E. G-3 is not a “CIDInvestigative Plan” itself, but is merely a recommendation for “additionalinvestigative actions”.2.Harvey’s letter makes no reference whatever to “completion of the SFPDinvestigation” nor to “perceived weaknesses of that investigation”.3.Harvey’s letter includes the recommendation to “get the names of thechildren that articulated a colorable connection to the Aquinos”. In fact no- 623 -children interviewed by the SFPD identified either Mrs. Aquino or myself.Harvey’s use of the term “colorable” is significant, as Webster’s definesthat word as “having an appearance of truth; feigned, factitious,counterfeit”. Harvey thus suggests that the CID hunt for anything thatcan be represented as evidence even if it is in fact not.4.Harvey’s statement that he “will prepare DODIG subpœnas” for use in aCID investigation is illegal. My Army attorney Captain Hayes informed methat Department of Defense Inspector General subpœnas are reserved foruse in Inspector General investigations, which this was clearly not.Pages 7-8: #14. On October 26, 1988 Wayne Boyles III, Legislative Assistant toSenator Jesse Helms, wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Army complainingabout plaintiff’s appearance on a Geraldo Rivera television show aboutSatanism and witchcraft. P.E. 1, Exhibit G. The CID investigation of plaintiffwas underway before any involvement by Senator Helms’ office.1.False statement by Lisowski. The letter from Boyles was dated 10/26/88.The CID investigation was opened 11/23/88 - almost a month after theBoyles letter. (Department of the Army Judge Advocate General’sInformation Paper, 11/23/88).Page 8:#15. On April 7 and 8, 1989 the CID interviewed Kinsey. After viewing aphotographic lineup, she identified plaintiff as “Mikey” but did not pick outMrs. Aquino as “Shamby”.1.The improper design and use of this photographic lineup has beendiscussed above.Page 8.#15. After viewing a video lineup Kinsey again identified plaintiff, and againdid not identify Mrs. Aquino as “Shamby”. G.E.D-9. (Identification lineups)at 100-101.1.After learning of this “video lineup” from the CID in May 1989, Irequested through my Army attorney Captain Hayes to be able to see it,particularly since the photo lineup was so obviously “stacked”. My requestwas denied.2.Under court rules of disclosure I should have been provided with everyexhibit of the CID ROI, to include the photo and video lineups. Inviolation of the law these two exhibits, which the CID has represented asso important and relevant, were not provided to me. Apart from my brief- 624 -glimpse of the photo lineup in May 1989, they have been concealed to thisday.3.If my face was the only one common to both the photo and the videolineups, it is all the less surprising that Almond had no trouble picking itout, aside from abundant prior exposure and coaching.Page 8:#15. Kinsey stated that “Shamby” and “Mr. Gary” took her to “Mr. Gary’shouse” and that “Mikey” was there.1.Every element of this aged (almost three years from the “CID-invented re-dating” of May-June 1986) statement has changed along the way in aneffort to make it “fit” revealed facts:• In her 1/14/87 FBI statement, Almond said nothing about being takenanywhere by anyone or having anything done to her anywhere. Sincethis denial was obviously unacceptable to her parents, she wasimmediately placed in “therapy” with Hickey, the abuse-finder for thePresidio scam.• By the third (2/3/87) “play session”, Almond now announced that shehad performed fellatio on “Mr. Gary” at the CDC. There is no mention ofgoing anywhere else, or of any other adult being involved.• It took Hickey and the A-Ts two more months to get Almond to agree toan off-CDC location. Finally on 4/7/87 Hickey asked Almond twice ifshe ever went anywhere with Hambright. Both times Almond said no.When Hickey refused to accept these answers, Almond only then saidyes - to “Sassy’s house”. In the same session Almond described the houseas “blue” and the bathtub as “blue” (neither correct concerning 123Acme).• There is no mention of “Mikey” by Almond whatever, at “the house” oranywhere else, for over two more months of “therapy”. On 6/2/87Michele A-T proposes a “Satanic cult”, and then on 6/30/87 Micheleintroduces “Mikey” as “Shambee’s husband”.• On 6/2/87 and 6/9/87 Almond said that the man at the house withHambright was “Dr. Steve”. As it turns out, “Dr. Steve” is the only realperson specifically and repeatedly identified by Almond as being at thehouse with Hambright. Michele admitted that “Dr. Steve” was aneighbor of theirs at the Presidio of San Francisco. Neither Hickey [perher notes] nor Michele reported this identification to the FBI/CID/- 625 -SFPD. There is no record that “Dr. Steve” was ever questioned, servedwith a search warrant, or titled on the strength of this authentic,unsolicited identification by Almond.• Clearly Lisowski’s succinct statement, which includes no mention of thisextensive coaching and revision whatever, is false and misleading.Page 8:#15. She described the house as blue-gray in color, the same color asplaintiff’s house at 123 Acme Avenue.1.On 4/7/87, after Hickey twice refused Almond’s denials that she had beentaken anywhere, Almond agreed that she had been taken to a house andthat it was blue (not “blue-gray”) in color.2.On the morning of 8/13/87 Michele A-T and Almond were taken to 123Acme Avenue and saw that it was entirely dark “battleship” gray incolor.3.Almost two years later, on 4/7-8/89, Almond reportedly told the CID(exact transcript not provided) that the house was now “blue-gray”.Clearly she had been coached to make the color try to fit 123 Acme as itwas now known to be.4.Again Lisowski’s statement to the court omits this sequence andattempted manufacture of evidence.5.Lisowski personally describes “blue-gray” as “the same color as 123Acme”, which in 1986 was solid dark “battleship” gray. Another deliberatefalse statement by Lisowski.Page 8:#16. On May 11, 1989 Kinsey was reinterviewed by CPT Boomer and MAJHarvey, judge advocates at the Presidio. She said that “Mikey” told her to"},{"pageContent":"touch “Mr. Gary’s” penis and that “Mikey” forced her to stay in the room withsoft walls, and blocked the door so she could not leave. She stated that shehad found the house with FBI Agent Foreman and that the house was blueand gray. Id. at 60-61.1.In the Hickey “therapy” session in which Michele introduced“Mikey” (6/30/87), Almond did not say that “‘Mikey’ told her to touch‘Mr. Gary’s’ penis”, nor did she say that “‘Mikey’ forced her to stay in theroom with soft walls and blocked the door so she could not leave”. Almondsaid nothing about “Mikey” to Hickey at any other “therapy” session, nordid she ever say anything about “a room with soft walls” - to Hickey or- 626 -Foreman. As noted above, the “room with soft walls” was added to theever-evolving scam-story by Michele after learning about our rooftoproom after the search.2.As I pointed out to Major Harvey in a 5/18/89 telephone conversationwhen he mentioned the Michele diary forgery to me, that little wetbar-room has picture windows that make its interior visible to scores ofapartment windows across the street, and it does not have a lock to locksomeone inside it.3.As demonstrated in A-T Violations Section #D, Almond did not “find 123Acme with Foreman”. She was taken directly to it, driven by itunsuccessfully, and finally walked to it by Michele and halted and coachedconcerning it by Michele.Pages 8-9: #17. On May 15, 1989 CID agents and legal advisors met with LTC CraigSchwender, Staff Judge Advocate for the Presidio, and reviewed theinvestigation and evidence with him. LTC Schwender opined that there wasprobable cause to title LTC Aquino for the offenses of indecent acts with achild, sodomy, conspiracy, kidnapping, and false swearing. G.E. D-16 at 113.LTC Schwender also opined that there was sufficient evidence to title Mrs.Aquino for sexual abuse, conspiracy, and kidnapping.1.There was, as abundantly demonstrated to date, not a shred of evidence totitle either Mrs. Aquino or myself for any of these offenses.2.The CID and the U.S. Army has no legal authority to title a civilian (Mrs.Aquino) in any case.3.Prior to this meeting, Schwender has already evidenced his bias in theinvestigation:• On 1/13/89 Schwender told TJAG that “the CID feels that Lt.Col.Aquino’s cooperation will be short-lived.” There was no basis for thisremark whatever. I willingly and actively cooperated with the CID rightup to June 1989 when I realized that the investigation was fraudulent.• On 1/13/89 Schwender told TJAG about Michele A-T’s forged diaryentry as though its authenticity were established beyond question.• On 1/26/89 Schwender falsely told TJAG that Major Harvey had foundsome documents by me that “speak about the doctrine of the Temple ofSet of using urine and feces in connection with their rituals”. There was- 627 -and is no such doctrine, and the Temple of Set has never used urine orfeces in any of its rituals.Page 9:#18. The final Report of Investigation (ROI) was issued on August 11, 1989.G.E. D at 1-4. On January 4, 1990 Major Harvey spoke with the staff judgeadvocate at Fort Leonard Wood, MO to determine what action thecommander of Fort Leonard Wood had decided to take in the case. Thecommander took no action against plaintiff as a result of the investigation.G.E. B at 3.1.My attorney Mr. Gary Myers was informed by Headquarters, Departmentof the Army that the decision not to court-martial me was made prior tothe titling decision (i.e. prior to August 1989). In that case the accountof the “decision by the Fort Leonard Wood commander on 1/4/90” isfalse, intended as a cover-up of the illegal conduct of the investigationprocess.2.On 10/2/89 the flag was removed from my personnel file at ARPERCEN.Such a flag would have remained in place unless a decision had alreadybeen made that there would be no charges preferred against me.3.Lisowski’s account is thus false and obstructs justice by concealing thisadditional misuse of investigatory/court-martial procedures.Page 16: The facts in the administrative record … [through page 17] … present at“Mr.Gary’s” house.1.As demonstrated herein and previously in abundant communications tothe Army, every single sentence in these three paragraphs iscompletely and deliberately false. Altogether these paragraphscontain at least nine separate false statements (if one counts by sentence),more if each sentence is broken down into phrases of known falsehoods.- 628 -Appendix 67: Gary Myers’ District Court Reply BriefUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of VirginiaAlexandria DivisionMichael A. Aquino, Plaintiffv.The Honorable Michael P.W. Stone, Secretary of the ArmyDepartment of the Army, Washington, D.C.,DefendantCivil Action No. 90-1547-APlaintiff’s Reply to Defendant’s Memorandum in Support ofthe Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the RecordArgumentPlaintiff is in substantial agreement with Defendant that an issue is raisedhere as tothe applicability of the provisions of the Privacy Act as to this matter giventheexemption provisions of 5 U.S.C. #552a(J)(2) and implementing regulations foundat32 C.F.R. #505.5, ID A 0508.11a USA CIDC. Plaintiff further agrees that if thisHonorable Court finds that if the Privacy Act does not apply, then the standardofreview to be applied is under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C.#702,and specifically 5 U.S.C. #706(2)(A), which is the “arbitrary, capricious, abuseofdiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law” standard. Neither damagesnorattorney’s fees and costs are contemplated by the APA. De novo review under thecircumstances of this case would be available only under the Privacy Act.Plaintiff brought suit under the Privacy Act because firstly Plaintiff is of thebeliefthat the exemption promulgated by the Secretary of the Army at 32 C.F.R. 505.5,IDA0508.11a USACIDC does not apply to this case, and secondly the conduct of theDefendant was so egregious as to take this case outside the exemption.The exemption at 32 C.F.R. 505.5 provides in part:(1) Sysname: Criminal Investigation and Crime Laboratory Files.(2) Exemption: All portions of this system of records which fall within 5 U.S.C.552a(j)(2) are exempt from the following provisions of Title 5 U.S.C. Section552a:(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(5),(e)(g), (f), and(g).(3) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(j)(2).- 629 -(4) Reasons: (a) ... (b) From subsections ... (g) [allowing suit under thePrivacy Act]because access might compromise ongoing investigations, revealclassified information, investigatory techniques or the identity of confidentialinformants, or invade the privacy of persons who provide information inconnection with a particular investigation. The exemption from accessnecessarily includes exemption from amendment, certain agencyrequirements relating to access and amendment of records, and civil liabilitypredicated upon agency compliance with those specific provisions of the PrivacyAct. The exemption from access necessarily includes exemption from otherrequirements. (Emphasis added)This exemption has nothing to do with the circumstances of this case. Plaintiffknewhe was being investigated and did not file an amendment request until afterPlaintiffwas titled and the ROI was sitting in the Crime Records Center in completedform. Infact the ROI was given to Plaintiff by Defendant in order for an amendmentrequest tobe filed.In the original ROI given to Plaintiff, certain matters were deleted with thenotation“Privacy Act”. These matters were later given to Plaintiff as a result ofPlaintiff’sdiscovery request for documents by the Defendant without protest.Succinctly stated, none of the reasons for exemption applies in this case:1. There is and was no ongoing investigation to be protected.2. There is and was no classified information.3. There is and was no unrevealed investigatory techniques or confidentialinformants.4. There is and was no invasion of any person’s privacy.What is for certain is that a bogus ROI sits in the Crime Records Center showingPlaintiff as having committed all manner of heinous acts, which ROI can berevealed tothe public under the Freedom of Information Act and which labels Plaintiff forlife.The rationale for exemption may apply during an investigation, but there is nonecessity for such an exemption when the ROI is revealed and the titling hasbeenaccomplished.The Plaintiff has dealt with most of the Defendant’s Statement of Facts inPlaintiff’sinitial brief. Nonetheless clarification is required in certain areas:- 630 -1. The only supposed identification of Plaintiff by Kinsey in 1987 was relatedto lawenforcement by Kinsey’s parents. Kinsey in 1987 - the time most proximate to thealleged event - never identified Plaintiff to anyone in law enforcement. In 1989the CIDsays Kinsey identified Plaintiff, but by then Kinsey had multiple opportunitiesto seepictures of Plaintiff, and the identification is worthless.2. Kinsey never identified Plaintiff’s house. The FBI agent in charge of theinvestigation did not report a positive identification (Defense Exhibit D-1). ACID agentalong for the ride said in the 1989 ROI that Kinsey positively identified thehouse as“Mr. Gary’s” house where she met “Mikey” and “Shamby”. 415 Where is thisstrikinginformation in the FBI report? Where is the CID report of the events of thatday? Thisnever happened. Kinsey supposedly said Mr. Gary drove her there. Gary Hambrightdidnot have a driver’s license. 4163. There is absolutely no proof of any kind that the CID investigation ofPlaintiffbegan before Jesse Helms’ office got involved. The “investigative plan” atDefenseExhibit G-3, dated 17 October 1988, is a concept that got reduced to practicewithSenator Helms’ intervention. 4174. The search warrant for Plaintiff’s home was for the entire house - not, astheDefense now suggests, for the top apartment alone. 418 The Bill Butch apartmentwassimply never considered “crime scene” material until 1991, when Plaintiff’s homeas the“crime scene” could no longer withstand scrutiny.415 In fact there is no statement by the CID agent that Kinsey said anythingabout or otherwise“identified” our house in any way whatever. The CID agent’s trip report insteadstates that Kinsey wasdriven directly to our block, then walked and driven by the house repeatedlywith no statement orgesture from her whatever. The CID agent reported only that Kinsey’s motherMichelle (who knew ouraddress beforehand) picked Kinsey up and held her in front of our house tosuggest to the lawenforcement personnel that there was an identification. It is rather anadditional indication of theadult A-Ts’ active effort to push their faked allegations.416 According to his Federal Public Defenders, Gary Hambright was an epilepticwho neither had adriver’s license nor knew how to drive nor owned an automobile.417 What during this lawsuit the CID tried to represent as a pre-Helms“investigative plan” was in facta 1-1/2-page letter by CID attorney Captain Mark Harvey suggesting various waysto manufacture andfalsify “evidence”, illegally employ Inspector General subpoenæ, and rigphoto/video lineups inviolation of CID Regulation CIDR 195-1 (11/1/86) to influence any possible courtaction against Lilithand myself.418 During the execution of the search warrant, moreover, I specifically askedinvestigators if theywished to go anywhere or see anything else in the entire building, and they allrefused. They wereinterested only in our apartment.- 631 -Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the elements of the offenses forwhichPlaintiff has been titled are as follows ( Manual for Courts Martial 1984):[Here are reprinted Articles 81 (Conspiracy), 125 (Sodomy), 134 (False Swearing)(Indecent Acts or Liberties with a Child) (Kidnapping) (Indecent Acts withAnother).]ConclusionFor the reasons indicated it is respectfully requested that judgment for thePlaintiffbe entered.Respectfully submitted,/s/ Gary R.

The dogma thathepredicates his religion upon comes from Egyptian and pre-Egyptian theologyhaving todo with the anti-Christ view of things. But nonetheless not a dogma thatsuggests abuseof children, animals, or any other form of heinous conduct is appropriate.And I want to predicate all that I do today on those two simple statements,becausewe are not dealing here with an individual who has gone outside the mainstreamofAmerican Society with regard to conduct. He has gone outside the mainstream ofAmerican Society in a protected Constitutional fashion with respect to religion.Now the Government in their brief suggests that although we have brought thissuitas the plaintiff on the Privacy Act, that it is an inappropriate vehicle, andthat the APAshould be used so that you are limited to an “arbitrary and capricious”standard. Webelieve that you need not get to the “arbitrary and capricious” issue. Webelieve that thePrivacy Act applies.If one examines the case of Ryan versus the Department of Justice decided by theFourth Circuit in 1979, there you will find, Your Honor, that the exemption fromthePrivacy Act which the Government relies upon was scrupulously examined by theFourth Circuit. That court concluded that the exemption is only viable if thereasons forthe exemption apply to the particular case.The reasons for the exemption of the Privacy Act in this case as stated in theC.F.R.applicable to this case are as follows:- If there is an ongoing investigation.- If there are classified matters to be revealed.- 634 -- If there are informants to be protected.- If there are individual privacy rights to be protected.- If there are investigatory techniques to be protected.None of those reasons apply to this case:- This is an investigation that was completed, completely and fully.- Matters that were a part of the Privacy Act in the prior investigation weregiven tothe plaintiff upon discovery requests for documents.- There is no ongoing investigation. This case comes before you after theinvestigation is utterly and totally completed.- There are no confidential informants, no privacy rights to be protected, nonationalsecrets to be revealed.So we believe as the plaintiff that the appropriate forum is the Privacy Actwith itsattendant damage provisions.Moving now, if I may, Your Honor, to certain questions that give rise to why wearehere:You have read the briefs. I am not going to belabor you with the facts. But itis morethan passing strange that the brief from the plaintiff, which laid out withparticularityegregious misconduct of the military in this case, was not rebutted - notrebutted.There is no “probable cause” in this case, Your Honor, which is the test, toconcludethat this man has done anything. The plaintiff through counsel has been able toidentifythree separate and distinct alibis, all of which have held up.The defendant in this case attempted to title the plaintiff’s wife based uponthe sameeyewitness testimony of the little girl who is supposed to have been molested.And yetthat woman, Mrs. Aquino, was taken off the title block by the Army,notwithstandingthe eyewitness testimony of this little girl.I point out to you, Your Honor, that this case was a cause celebre in the SanFrancisco Bay Area and most of the west coast. It received huge amounts ofpublicity.The FBI and the San Francisco Police Department were inextricably involved in itformonth upon month. Nothing came of it.What did happen after they closed their cases was that Senator Jesse Helms,because of the high-profile nature of my client, initiated an inquiry tothen-SecretaryMarsh regarding my client. And you have Senator Helms’ letter in front of you.- 635 -And I say this to you, Judge, very simply what happened was this: A couple ofparents who had a little girl decided that Michael Aquino was a reasonabletarget. Andthe CID, which is the Army investigative branch, in league with their superiorsstarted acampaign to make certain that Senator Helms was satisfied and that this Satanismwould be eliminated from the Army. And that is exactly what happened. And Istand onevery line and sentence that you have in that brief before you.Now as a result of all of this, the parents of this little girl have filed $3million inclaims from the United States Government.There is not one other child at the Presidio Day Care Center, not one otherchild outof a multitude of nearly 20 who alleged abuse, who could “identify” MichaelAquino orhis wife other than this little girl who was then three years old. And when didthis littlegirl “identify” Michael Aquino? Not in 1987, when all this happened - when theFBI wasthere. Her parents said she identified him, supposedly, in 1989.Now we are talking about the memory of a very small child. And I ask you to takejudicial notice at least of what two- and three-year-olds can and cannotremember.There is not the slightest prospect, Your Honor, that my client engaged in anyformof misfeasance or malfeasance. As an Army officer he was utterly superior, buttheythrew him out. And the way they threw him out was this: He came up forcontinuationas an AGR officer, meaning a National Guard officer. 419 The test for that waswhether ornot he was “fully qualified”. And you will find a memo in the file, part of theexhibits,showing that he clearly was “fully qualified”. And there was a billet for him tofill.But what the Army did was that they advised this continuation board that MichaelAquino had been flagged. Improper. The only matter that is supposed to be beforethat continuation board is his OMPF, which is basically his personnel file.Improper.There is an interesting memorandum detailing the scenario of events thatoccurredin the Aquino matter which I have provided to the Court as an exhibit, which wasobtained under the Freedom of Information Act.Judge, this is simply a case where there are no conspirators. There never wasanyevidence that Michael Aquino was in any way, shape, or form associated with aMr.Gary Hambright, who was at the Presidio Day Care Center. Mrs. Aquino was droppedfrom the titling block for lack of “probable cause”. Whom did he conspire with?419 AGR = Active Guard & Reserve, a fulltime active duty program for both theArmy Reserve and theArmy National Guard. I am an Army Reserve officer.- 636 -This child was examined by medical doctors and found to be perfectly fitphysically.Although she said she was raped, although she said she was sodomized, there isnoevidence of that.Michael Aquino could not have done this. This child was only in Mr. Hambright’sclass in September and October of 1987. And Michael Aquino was here inWashingtonduring that period of time.What the CID did was they tried to figure out when Aquino was in San Franciscoand convert the facts to that date. The only date that they found to bemeaningful wasJune 10, 1987. Plaintiff has provided an absolute alibi for that date.Your Honor, my practice is limited to military law. And I know the men who aremaking these decisions, and they are not evil men. It is not the evil men wehave toworry about. It is the well-intentioned ones who bend to pressure. And that iswhat hashappened in this case.No matter what standard you choose to employ - whether it be the “arbitrary andcapricious” standard because you do not feel that the Privacy Act applies here[and westrenuously suggest that it does] - you must conclude, Your Honor, that it is“arbitraryand capricious” - I say this respectfully, of course - “arbitrary andcapricious” not totitle Mrs. Aquino and to title Dr. Aquino when the same little girl identifiedthem both.No, there was an agenda here, Judge. The Army carried out that agenda. They madecertain that the man would never go to trial, because they titled him after theStatute ofLimitations ran. They had the best of all worlds. They satisfied Senator Helms,theysatisfied their own needs, and they left this man with no career.And that is what happened in this case, Judge. And | believe that the factualrepresentations we have made, all of which are supported by documentation, noneofwhich are speculative, all of which are unrebutted by the Government, aredispositive.Thank you.The Court: All right.Mr. Lisowski: Your Honor, at the outset I would like to say that the Governmenthas not chosen to respond to every allegation that plaintiff makes because theGovernment feels very strongly that there is absolutely no credence to most ofthoseallegations at all, and that to respond to those is not necessary. The facts ofthe case arefairly straightforward.- 637 -This case comes down to two issues, Your Honor: Does the Privacy Act exemptionapply; and, if so, were the Government’s actions “arbitrary and capricious”?The Government agrees with plaintiff’s counsel, and plaintiff has conceded, thatifthe Privacy Act exemption does apply - the (j)(2) exemption - then the“arbitrary andcapricious” standard is the correct one to apply in this case. And if that isthe correctstandard under the APA, then plaintiff is entitled to no damages. Plaintiffseeks thebroader de novo review, and he seeks the glimmer of hope that he can recoversomedamages under the Privacy Act.The Ryan case states that there are two requirements for a proper exemption:First,that the Secretary promulgate regulations, which the Secretary of the Army hasdone in32 C.F.R. 505.5. And secondly, that those regulations state the reasons whyrecords areexempt. And the Army has also done that.I think a case that is better on point here, Your Honor, is the Wentz case thatis citedin the Government brief. Ryan involved a Privacy Act issue of access andwrongfuldisclosure. The Wentz case involves a plaintiff who was seeking to amend a law-enforcement record, which is more directly on point here. And in Wentz the Courtnoted that the (j)(2) exemption is a general exemption which is designed toapply to awhole system of records, which is the case here.And the Court in Wentz also noted that in examining this issue, the Privacy Actexemption or the Privacy Act provision for amendment of records falls under552a(d).And that subsection is entitled “Access to Records”. And access, as is stated intheregulation, necessarily includes amendment.So it is not inconsistent for the Government in their exemption regulations toalsoaddress access to records. And under the subsection in the Privacy Act statute,it isconsistent then for that access to also include amendments to records, and thereasonsare the same.For that reason, Your Honor, the Government urges that the Privacy Act exemptiondoes apply in this case.Even if Your Honor were to find that the exemption does not apply, the PrivacyActstill allows a plaintiff only to amend factual determinations. And in this case,YourHonor, clearly the facts are not in dispute. The little girl made theidentification at the- 638 -Post Exchange while she was shopping with her parents. 420 And the dispute thattheplaintiff has is with the evaluation and determination of those facts.And the Privacy Act is not meant to allow a plaintiff who disagrees with adetermination to change, shape, or color that determination to his own likings.It ismeant to allow the plaintiff to attack facts that are in error. And plaintiff isonly allowedto attack the determination if he can discredit each and every one of theunderlyingfacts. And plaintiff has not done so in this case.Additionally, Your Honor, if you find - once again assuming that the Privacy Actdidapply - plaintiff would would not be entitled to damages. He has the veryformidablebarrier that in order to prove damages, he has to show causation. And the onlycausation that is mentioned here in the record is purely speculative, on whetheror notthe Continuation Board may have known that the plaintiff was flagged or titled,whether or not that would be improper. And that certainly doesn’t meet the highhurdleof causation. And it doesn’t come close to meeting the even higher hurdle ofshowingthat the Army acted willfully and intentionally in doing so. 421Finally, Your Honor, the only way one can rule for the plaintiff in this case istoadopt the plaintiff’s view of the facts. And that means that you have to assumeor youhave to believe that a mother and a father instructed their daughter tofabricate thisstory of child molestation and to identify or pick out someone who they didn’tlike, andtalk their daughter or embed in her somehow the fact that this was the man thatmolested you.If you look at the facts, Your Honor, Colonel Aquino left the Presidio SanFranciscoin the end of the summer of 1986. He was assigned here in Washington, D.C. AfterWashington, D.C. his follow-on assignment was to go to St. Louis. He was onlyback inthe Presidio in San Francisco during that summer. Plaintiffs would not even knowthat420 There were only the allegations of her parents that Kinsey Almond made any“PX identification”.No PX personnel corroborated any “PX encounter” whatever, and the parents gaveseveral conflicting,inconsistent, and physically impossible versions of their statement toinvestigators. [Major Lisowskiwas aware of this at the time of this hearing.]421 As Lisowski knew at the time of this hearing - but which he and the CID hadillegally concealedfrom Myers and myself - the CID had taken a far more deliberate and direct rolein illegally fixing theAGR continuation board. In a book which I discovered only after this districtcourt hearing, CID chiefinvestigator Major Mark Harvey stated:“[Aquino’s] name is now entered in our records as the perpetrator. We don’t haveto doanything about it - in fact we aren’t going to force a court martial in thiscase. There are tworeasons for that: the first is that it would not be good for the kids to have togo to court now andbe cross-examined. The second is simply that his secondment to the Regular Armyisending: we just won’t renew his contract, so in effect we are getting rid of himthatway. ” (Tim Tate, Children for the Devil, 1991)- 639 -he was back there. He had left the Presidio. How would they know that theirdaughterwould see that person in the Post Exchange in San Francisco in the summer of1987when he had left that area for a year and he was being reassigned to St. Louis?422And yet this girl, in a completely public setting, identifies this man as“Mikey”, aman who sodomized her and having her place her mouth on his penis. Therewouldn’tbe any tears or anything in her vagina or anus for that kind of sodomy. 423Based on the facts, Your Honor, you would have to believe that there was a giantconspiracy between the parents, the daughter, the psychiatrist, the childpsychiatristthat treated the girl, between the CID agents who investigated the case, betweenthe422 As noted in #2 above, there is no evidence that the child Kinsey Almondnoticed Mrs. Aquino ormyself during our August 1987 visit to the Presidio PX. One or both of the adultAdams-Thompsonsobviously did notice us, and recognized us from official Presidio social eventsduring the pre-June1986 period when both Chaplain A-T and I were assigned to the garrison.423 See notes above. Almond made no verified “PX identification”, and no“identification” whateveruntil two years later, when the CID alleged that she picked my picture out of an[CID regulation-illegal] photo-lineup. By that time, obviously, her parents had had plenty oftime to teach her tochoose any photo or video of me presented to her.Lisowski ignores the facts that rape and rectal sodomy of a 2-year-old child, asher stepfatheralleged, would definitely leave physical damage evidence, and that a medicalexamination of Kinseyshortly after the “allegation window” indicated “no evidence of abuse”.Lisowski also ignores the fact that rape, rectal, or oral sodomy wouldpresumably be so traumaticto a child as to cause instantly-noticeable psychological damage. Almond wasnever taken to anydoctor for any such complaint at the time of the allegation window.- 640 -military policemen and investigators who reviewed the case, and between theofficialsin the Army Criminal Law Division who also reviewed the case.424And finally, Your Honor, plaintiff is not left without a remedy here. ThePrivacy Actrequires and Army Regulation 195-2 provides that remedy: That if the plaintiffdisagrees with a determination that is made, he should be allowed to state thereasonsfor his disagreements, and those reasons should be appended to that officialrecord. Asyou can see by the volume of this administrative record that you have, AppendixF,which is part of the Criminal Investigation Division report of investigation,includes allof the submissions made by the plaintiff which state his side of the story andthereasons why he disagrees with this.But the proper way to dispose of this case, Your Honor, is to examine the (j)(2)exemption under the Privacy Act, and to conclude that this (j)(2) exemptionappliesunder the Ryan case and the Wentz case under either or both cases to this caseat hand,424 “The parents”: had a $3 million get-rich-quick scheme in mind. Later, whenthe Helms-drivenagenda began, they were obviously pleased to cooperate in this convenientrevival of their scheme.“The daughter”: made no “identification” of me until two years after her parentsinitiated theirscheme, and never any “identification” of Lilith. In her interview with the CIDon 7-8 April 1989,“Almond denied that ‘Mikey’ and/or ‘Shamby’ [the names her parents tried totwist into labels forourselves] had ever done anything bad to either her or to other children in herpresence.” (CIDReport)“The psychiatrist”: As revealed by her own session notes, Hickey had her ownagenda of“diagnosing” Presidio children brought to her by refusing to accept any denialsfrom them, andcontinuing to harass them until they said what she wanted them to say. The ArmyMedical Corpsrefused without any explanation my request that Hickey’s mass-diagnoses of“abuse” throughout theentire Presidio episode be examined for professional incompetence.“The CID agents who investigated the case”: had a predetermined agenda to frameLilithand myself, stemming from Helms’ demands on the Secretary of the Army, andimmediatelyevidenced by CID fixing of the AGR continuation board at the very beginning ofthe supposedly-unbiased “investigation”. The CID’s massive criminal actions, such asmanufacture and suppression ofevidence, misprision of serious offense, and numerous false official statements[including to thiscourt], also speak for themselves. Even before the opening of the CIDinvestigation, CID attorneyMark Harvey sent a letter to the CID San Francisco Field Office suggesting waysin which CIDregulations could be violated and “evidence” manufactured concerning Lilith andmyself.“The Army Criminal Law Division”: On 11/23/88 (the same date on which the CIDinvestigation of me was opened) Lt.Col. John Burton of the Department of theArmy Judge AdvocateGeneral’s Office (TJAG) sent a secret [from me] briefing paper to the Directorof the Army Staffexploring several excuses for eliminating me from active service, such as“conduct unbecoming” and“moral or professional dereliction” and advising possible bases under which Icould be expelled.Burton’s paper was secretly briefed to TJAG, ODCSPER, DACH, OCAR, PA, OCLL,M&RA, and GC ina secret [from me] meeting held in the Pentagon on 11/29/88. The Judge AdvocateGeneral of theArmy - a 3-star general - personally traveled to Helms’ office on 2/1/89 “todiscuss LTC Aquino’sstatus”.- 641 -and that the Army did not act “arbitrarily and capriciously” in making itsdetermination.Your Honor, plaintiff has a lot better chance in this case of fitting a camelthroughthe eye of a needle than showing that the Army acted “arbitrarily andcapriciously” intheir determination that Lt. Colonel Aquino sexually abused this child. This isnot acase of a witch hunt or a warlock hunt, and it is not a case of religiousdiscrimination.Plaintiff was not titled because he the chief priest or the High Priest of theTemple ofSet. It is completely irrelevant, Your Honor. 425 He was titled in this reportofinvestigation because the evidence shows that he committed indecent acts with achild,and that he conspired with others to take this child away from the day carecenter, takethem to his apartment, and that’s where he sexually abused her. 426Thank you, Your Honor.The Court: All right.Mr. Myers: If I may, Judge. There is no evidence that this child has told anyoneherself that she identified Michael Aquino. The parents say this.425 To summarize just a few of the religious prejudicial actions and influencesin this case:On or about 12/8/88, in response to publicity concerning my religion in October1988, the Officeof Secretary of the Army Marsh sent letters to at least thirty senators andrepresentatives stating that“the Army by no means encourages ‘devil worship’”. The Secretary of the Armythus stated an officialposition of prejudice against a legitimate religion in direct violation of theFirst and FourteenthAmendments to the Constitution and in violation of AR 600-20 (prohibitingreligious discriminationin the Army) - and did so specifically with reference to me and coincidentallywith the just-openedCID “investigation”.On 12/2/88 - also just after the opening of the CID “investigation” - Vice Chiefof Staff of the ArmyGeneral Arthur Brown, the second-highest-ranking officer in the Army, sent aletter to the presidentof NBC denouncing the Temple of Set and equating the legitimate Satanic religionwith “lawlessness”and “vandalism”. Brown cited an official position paper from the Army’s Officeof the Chief of PublicAffairs containing numerous religious defamations and distortions, as well asdenial of Constitutionalprotections.Major Mark Harvey, author of the CID ROI, devoted major portions of it tomisrepresenting andattacking my religious beliefs and actions, and the Temple of Set generally.Prior to writing the ROI hebragged to my Army attorney Captain Thomas Hayes that he was certain he could“get around” myConstitutional First Amendment religious protections.426 There was in actuality no evidence whatever of any child sexual abuse,kidnapping, conspiracy,or involvement of our home in any way - as Lisowski well knew at the time ofthis hearing.- 642 -But let me point out to you, Your Honor: This little girl at the same timeadvised thepsychiatrist that her next door neighbor, who was a doctor, Dr. Steve, was partof thiseffort as well. 427This little girl identified the car that the Aquinos “owned” as the one thatMrs.Aquino drove her in. It was a rented car. It could not have been their car. Itwasrented for the weekend that they were out there. The little girl’s testimony isutterlyincredible. 428And it wasn’t this little girl alone who is supposed to have gone to the Aquinohome,Judge. It was multiple children. And the only day the Army has in theirinvestigationwas June 10. Yet no other child could identify Dr. Aquino or Mrs. Aquino or thehomethey lived in - no other child. And yet they were supposed to. 429The Army glibly talks about a conspiracy. With whom? Mrs. Aquino couldn’t havebeen in it. The Army decided not to title her. There is no evidence that GaryHambrighteven knew Michael Aquino. With whom? It is easy to say conspiracy, but withwhom?And upon what factual predicate?No, Judge. This isn’t a neat and tidy little case where we can just sweep itaway andsay “we did a wonderful job here protecting the public interest”. This was aconcertedeffort to bury this plaintiff. And the facts that I have put in that brief arenot“speculation”, Judge. They come from government documents. Each and every factissupported by exhibit number. And each and every fact comes from the government.Not “speculation”, Judge. This is a serious matter.Thank you.The Court: All right. I will look at this further, and I will get an answer toyou all insome reasonable time.Mr. Lisowski: Thank you, Your Honor.427 In the Hickey notes of Almond’s “therapy” sessions, Almond makes noreference to us or a houselike ours, but does say that she was taken to the house of a “Dr. Steve”, whomher parents laterindicated was a neighbor of theirs on the Presidio. There is no indication that“Dr. Steve” was evermade a subject of investigation by anyone based on Almond’s actual allegations.428 To clarify: When Lilith and I visited the Presidio PX in August 1987, werented a car for our briefstay in the city. The A-Ts saw us with this car at the PX and - not realizing itwas just a rental car -alleged that Almond “identified” it as the one she had been abducted in theprevious year.429 In fact the two other children that Almond said were with her during her“abuse” denied in allinterviews that any such kidnapping or abuse had happened at all.- 643 -Mr. Myers: Thank you, Judge.The Court: If we have no further business, we will adjourn until Monday morning.Hearing Concluded- 644 -Appendix 69: District Court DecisionUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of VirginiaAlexandria DivisionMichael A. Aquino, Plaintiffv.The Honorable Michael P.W. Stone, Secretary of the ArmyDepartment of the Army, Washington, D.C.,DefendantCivil Action No. 90-1547-AOrderThis matter came before the court on cross motions for summary judgment. For thereasons stated in the accompanying memorandum opinion, it is hereby ordered thatplaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is denied and that defendant’s motionforsummary judgment is granted and this case is dismissed./s/ Claude M. HiltonUnited States District JudgeAlexandria, VirginiaJuly 1, 1991Memorandum OpinionThis is a civil action brought by the plaintiff, Aquino, against the defendant,theSecretary of the Army, pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.A. #552a(g).Plaintiff alleges that the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command(CID)has refused to amend a Report of Investigation (ROI) which states that theplaintiff wasthe subject of an investigation for sexual child abuse and related crimes.Plaintiff seeksto remove his name from the title block of the ROI, to recover damages for theallegedwillful and intentional misconduct of the Army for refusing to accuratelymaintain thisrecord, and to recover attorney fees and costs.This matter came before the court on defendant’s motion for summary judgment.The Secretary of the Army asserts that the plaintiff has failed to state a claimunder thePrivacy Act because the ROIs are exempt from the amendment and civil liabilityprovisions of the Privacy Act. If the Privacy Act exemption applies, plaintiff’sonlyremaining remedy for relief is pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act(APA), 5- 645 -U.S.C.A. #702, where the standard of review of the defendant’s refusal to amendtheROI is whether or not the defendant acted “arbitrarily and capriciously”.Plaintiffargues that the Privacy Act does apply in this case because the rationale fortheexemption is not present in this case. Therefore the standard of review of theArmy’sactions is de novo.Plaintiff is a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army Reserve. His nameappears in the title block of a CID ROI for indecent acts with a child andrelatedoffenses. Kinsey Marie Adams-Thompson appears in the victim block of thatreport.She and her parents were interviewed by an FBI agent about allegations of childabuseat the Child Development Center (CDC) in 1987 because Kinsey told a doctor atthebase that a CDC employee, Gary Hambright, had sexually molested her. Later aninvestigation of LTC Aquino and his wife also commenced.In January 1988 plaintiff made a written sworn statement denying the allegationsagainst him and preferring sworn charges against Captain Adams-Thompson, thechild’s father. Plaintiff charged Captain Adams-Thompson with conduct unbecomingan officer because the Captain reported the allegations of child abuse to theSanFrancisco Police. 430 Based on these sworn statements, plaintiff wasinvestigated forfalse swearing. 431Although the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) closed its investigation andfiled no charges against the plaintiff or anyone else, the CID investigatorsdrafted aninvestigative plan for plaintiff’s case. 432430 In fact I twice preferred formal charges against Chaplain A-T - first on1/4/88 and again on11/29/89. The two specifications were for (1) “knowingly and with maliciousintent make falsestatements and representations defaming the characters of Lt. Colonel Michael A.Aquino and Mrs.Lilith Aquino”, and (2) filing “one ore more false claims, based upon the falsestatements andrepresentations identified in Specification 1, such claims totaling at least$750,000 and possibly asmuch as $3 million, and such claim or claims thus constituting a deliberateattempt by him to defraudthe United States Government”. Both preferrals of charges were summarily andillegally dismissed byhis superiors without a full Rule for Courts Martial #303 investigation. Suchdismissals thusconstitute both “obstruction of justice” and “misprision of serious offense”violations of Article 134,UCMJ. Requests for correction of the dismissals, up to the 3-star general level,were brushed aside orignored altogether.Two additional factual corrections: (1) Lawrence Adams-Thompson was KinseyAlmond’sstepfather, not her father. (2) There is no evidence that the fake story told byhim to the S.F.P.D.existed in any form prior to his own utterance of it. Therefore he invented,rather than “reported” it.431 All of the statements in my two sworn charges against ChaplainAdams-Thompson were andremain true, and the CID never rebutted a single one of them, during thislawsuit or at any other time.432 No such “investigative plan” was ever produced by the CID during thediscovery phase of thislawsuit. The CID claimed that a 1-1/2-page letter by Captain Mark Harvey,proposing ways to violatethe law in order to frame a case against me, was an “investigative plan”; veryobviously it was not.- 646 -After the investigation the evidence was reviewed by LTC Schwender, Staff JudgeAdvocate for the Presidio. He determined that there was probable cause to titleLTCAquino with offenses of indecent acts with a child, sodomy, conspiracy,kidnapping,and false swearing. 433The final ROI was issued in August 1989. In January 1990 plaintiff appealed thetitling determination. Plaintiff’s amendment request was reviewed internally.ColonelGilligan, who reviewed the amendment request, recommended deleting plaintifffromseveral charges which had been investigated. 434 The commanding general of theCIDadopted those recommendations in September 1990.[7] However plaintiff remainstitled for “indecent acts with a child, sodomy, conspiracy, kidnapping, indecentacts,and false swearing”.Under the Privacy Act an individual may gain access to, and may requestamendment of his record or any information which is contained in a system ofrecordsmaintained by an agency. 5 U.S.C.A. #552a(d)(1)&(2). Under 5 U.S.C.A. #552a(g)anindividual is permitted to bring a civil action against the agency in the UnitedStatesdistrict courts whenever any agency determines not to amend an individual’srecord inaccordance with his request. However an agency may exempt law enforcementrecordsfrom the application of #552a(d)&(g) under subsection 552a(j)(2). To properlyexempta system of records from the Privacy Act requirements, “an agency must: (1)promulgate rules, pursuant to the rule-making requirements of#553(b)(1),(2),&(3),(c)&(e) ... and (2) state the reasons in the rule itself why the system ofrecords is to beexempt from a provision of the Act”. Ryan v. Department of Justice, 595 F.2d954,957(4th Cir. 1979). In this case the parties have not challenged the exemption ofthe entiresystem of records, specifically criminal investigation files, but the plaintiffdoeschallenge the applicability of that exemption in this case.Plaintiff argues that the reasons listed for the exemption in 32 C.F.R. #505.5do notapply in this case.a Plaintiff asserts that there is and was no ongoinginvestigation to beprotected, there is and was no classified information, there is and was nounrevealedinvestigatory techniques or confidential informants, and there is and was noinvasionof any person’s privacy. Accordingly plaintiff asserts that there is nonecessity for theexemption when the ROI is revealed and the titling is accomplished.The Army, though, has completely exempted this entire system of records from thecivil remedies provisions of the Privacy Act. The Army promulgated rules at 32C.F.R.433 Schwender made these decisions before the investigation (TWX, FOUO, 6RCID toUSACIDC,11/22/88). No SFPD or FBI justification was included in the ROI.434 Gilligan may have in fact recommended deleting all titlings but wasoverruled by unidentifiedsenior authorities. See my 10/18/90 letter to Brigadier General Thomas Kilmartinin Chapter #7.- 647 -#505.5 and complied with the requirement for stating the reasons for theexemption inthe rule. Within that exemption the Army has exempted the failure to amend acriminalinvestigation from the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act. “Byrequiring theagency to state the reasons in the rule itself for exempting a system of recordsfrom aprovision of the Privacy Act, the extent of the exemption intended can be fullyascertained.” Ryan, 595 F.2d at 958. Furthermore “the exemption authorized by 5U.S.C. #552a(j)(2) is a general exemption which applies to a whole system ofrecords ofthe agency, and therefore the Privacy Act ‘does not require that a regulation’srationalefor exempting a record from disclosure apply in each particular case’”. Wentz v.Department of Justice, 772 F.2d 335,337 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S.1086(1986) (quoting Shapiro v. Drug Enforcement Agency, 721 F.2d 215,218 (7th Cir.1983)).In Wentz the appellant argued that since a certain document had already beenrevealed to him, the exemption to amendment had no relevancy to him. 772 F.2d at337. The court rejected this argument, since the rationale of the exemption neednotapply in each particular case. Further, in the appellant’s original copy of thedocumentrequested, certain portions of the document were deleted and only included intheJustice Department’s copy. Thus the exemption would be applicable in certainsituations. Id. at 338.Similarly plaintiff’s original ROI had certain matters deleted with the notation“Privacy Act”. Although the plaintiff received the full copy in discovery,435there may beoccasions when the Army copy would contain information that would not becontainedin an individual’s copy, and the exemption would be applicable. In addition,since theexemption need not apply in each particular case, the exemption applies toplaintiff’scase as well.Because the exemption from the Privacy Act specifically covers the entire systemofrecords in which plaintiff’s ROI is contained, plaintiff cannot bring an actionfor civilremedies pursuant to the Privacy Act. Therefore the applicable standard ofreview ofthe Army’s decision not to amend the plaintiff’s ROI is whether the Army acted“arbitrarily and capriciously”.The Army reviewed plaintiff’s request to amend the ROI under Army Regulation195-2 since the ROIs are exempt from the amendment provisions of the PrivacyAct.bThus plaintiff’s only remaining remedy is under the APA. The APA does not waivesovereign immunity from claims for monetary relief. See, e.g., Rhodes v. UnitedStates,760 F.2d 1180,1184 (11th Cir. 1985); Ghandi v. Police Dept. of Detroit, 747 F.2d435 Actually I did not receive a full copy. Omitted, for example, were theillegal CID lineup pictures.Some important evidence, such as the complete Hickey notes, was also omittedfrom [possibly theoriginal as well] ROI because they may have contained information contradictingthe ROI’s agenda.- 648 -338,343 (6th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1042 (1988); Doe v. Civiletti,635 F.2d88,94 (2nd Cir. 1980). Therefore plaintiff is only entitled to injunctive-typerelief basedon a review of the Army’s refusal to delete his name from the ROI title block.Under the APA plaintiff is not entitled to de novo review of his claim becausesuchreview is only afforded under the APA when seeking enforcement ofnonadjudicatoryagency action and when the factfinding procedures are inadequate. See 5 U.S.C.A.#706(2)(F). Thus the court should determine whether the Army’s action was“arbitrary,capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”. 5U.S.C.A.#706(2)(A). Under this standard of review the Army decision maker is affordedconsiderable deference. The inquiry is confined to whether the decisionchallenged wasbased on relevant factors and whether there was a clear error in judgment.Heisig v.United States, 719 F.2d 1153 (Fed. Cir. 1983); Sidoran v. Commissioner, 640 F.2d231(9th Cir. 1981).The facts in the administrative record support the conclusion that the CIDdecisionnot to remove plaintiff’s name from the title block was not arbitrary orcapricious.There was sufficient evidence from which the Army decision maker could determinethat probable cause existed to believe that the plaintiff committed theoffenses. The factthat reasonable minds may differ over the conclusions reached does not mean thatArmy decision makers made a clear error in judgment. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs.Ass’n v.State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. , 463 U.S. 29,43 (1983); Benvenuti v.Department of Defense, 613 F. Supp. 308,311-12 (D. D.C. 1985), aff’d, 802 F.2d469(Fed.

Whether, assuming the district court correctly concluded that the exemptionregulation bars this action under the Privacy Act, the court erred in concludingthatthe Army’s findings were not arbitrary and capricious under the AdministrativeProcedure Act.Standard of ReviewThe appropriate standard of review with respect to issues I and II is de novo.As thiscircuit previously has recognized, “summary judgments are reviewed de novo onappeal.” Miller v Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 906 F.2d 972, 974 (4thCir.1990); Higgins v Dupont De Nemours & Co., 863 F.2d 1162, 1166-67 (4th Cir.1988);Felty v Graves-Humphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, 1127-28 (4th Cir. 1987). Moreoverstatutory interpretation is reviewed de novo in other circuits.

Nature of the Case and Prior ProceedingsPlaintiff filed a complaint on November 15, 1990 seeking damages and adeclaratoryjudgment to amend the titling action and to remove Plaintiff’s name from thetitleblock of United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC or CID)R e p o r t o f I n v e s t i g a t i o n ( R O I ) f i n a l “ C ” - 0 6 1 0 -8 8 - C I D C O 2 6 - 6 9 2 55K3/6F3/6E7/6A1/5M2/5y2/DIMIS under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g) (1) (A) & (C) of theAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff was titled for Conspiracy,Kidnapping, Sodomy, Indecent Acts and False Swearing. Plaintiff contended thePrivacy Act provides for de novo judicial review of the amendment request, or iftheROI is found exempt under subsection (j) (2) of the Act, then the action isreviewable asan agency action under the APA.The Army argued that its failure to amend or expunge the ROI was exempted underthe provisions of the Privacy Act allowing agencies to exempt criminalinvestigatoryrecords pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) (2) and the Army’s implementing regulation.32C.F.R. § 505.5, ID-A0508.1aUSACIDC. The Army also argued that it had not actedarbitrarily or capriciously in refusing to amend the ROI, and that there was nobasis foran award of damages. Both sides moved for summary judgment.By order entered July 1, 1991 the district court agreed with the Army, findingtheROI exempt from amendment under the Privacy Act. It also found that the Army hadnot acted arbitrarily or capriciously in refusing to amend the ROI under theAPA, andthat there was no basis for an award of damages. Plaintiff appealed.B. The District Court DecisionThe district court first rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the (j) (2)exemption isnot viable when the reasons listed in the Army’s exemption regulation do notapply inthe particular case. The court also rejected the plaintiff’s argument that thereis nonecessity for the exemption when the ROI is fully revealed and the titlingaction iscompleted. The court, interpreting Ryan v Dept of Justice, 595 F.2d at 954, 958,(4thCir. 1979), held that the Army regulation had completely exempted the entire CIDrecord system by promulgating rules and complying with the requirement to statethereasons for the exemption in the rule. The court further found that theexemption- 652 -under subsection (j) (2) is a general exemption which applies to a whole systemofrecords, and that the Privacy Act does not require a regulation’s rationale toapply ineach particular case, citing only Wentz v Dept. of Justice, 772 F.2d 335, 337(7th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1086 (1986) and Shapiro v Drug Enforcement Agency,721 F.2d 215, 218 (7th Cir. 1983).Under the APA standard of review, the court found that the Army’s refusal toamendthe ROI was not arbitrary and capricious, relying on the “considerabledeference”traditionally afforded Army decision-makers under Heisig v U.S. , 719 F.2d 1153(Fed.Cir. 1983); Sidoran v Commissioner, 640 F.2d 231 (9th Cir. 1981). The court thenstated that the facts supported the CID decision not to amend the ROI and therewassufficient evidence of probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committedtheoffenses. Finally the court held that sovereign immunity is not waived under theAPA,so there was no basis for an award of damages. By order the court dismissed thecase,denying the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and granting the Army’smotionfor summary judgment. The plaintiff’s appeal followed.C. The Statutory Scheme and the Army Exemption RegulationUnder the Privacy Act an individual may gain access to, and may requestamendment of his record or any information which is contained in a system ofrecordsmaintained by an agency whenever he believes the records are not “accurate,relevant,timely or complete”. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d) (1) and (2). Under subsection (g) anindividualis permitted to bring a civil action against the agency in the U.S. districtcourtswhenever any agency refuses to amend the records. However an agency may exemptlaw enforcement records from the application of subsection (d) and (g) undersubsection (j) (2) if the system of records is... (2) maintained by an agency or component thereof which performs as itsprincipalfunction any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws ... andwhichconsists of ... (B) information compiled for the purposes of a criminalinvestigation ....Under the more inclusive language of subsection (k) of the Act, an agency canexempt records from specific provisions (including (d)) if the system of recordsis... (2) investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other thanmaterial within the scope of subsection (g) (2).To properly exempt a system of records, both sections require that the agency“promulgate rules, pursuant to the rulemaking requirements of § 553(b) ... andstatethe reasons in the rule why the system of records is to be exempted from aprovision of”the Act.- 653 -The Army has promulgated a regulation, 32 C.F.R. § 505.5, exempting ROIs as partof its CID record system, and has stated the specific reasons why the recordsystem isexempt. The regulation provides in part:(2) Exemption - All portions of this system of records (Criminal InvestigationsandCrime Laboratory Files) which fall within 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2) are exempt from(5U.S.C. § 552a(d) and (g) ....(4) Reasons - ...(b) From subjections (d) ... and (g) because access mightcompromiseongoing investigations, reveal classified information, investigatory techniquesor theidentity of confidential informants, or invade the privacy of persons whoprovideinformation in connection with a particular investigation.D. Relevant FactsPlaintiff is a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Reserve. His nameappears in the title block of a CID ROI for Conspiracy, Kidnapping, Sodomy,IndecentActs with a Child and False Swearing. II app. 227. The test for titling is thatof probablecause. AR 195-2, para. 4-4b, add. A-11.Kinsey Adams-Thompson appears in the victim block of that report. She and herparents were interviewed by an FBI agent about allegations of child abuse at theU.S.Army Presidio, California, Child Development Center (CDC) in 1987 because Kinseytold a doctor at the Fort that a CDC employee, Gary Hambright, had sexuallymolestedher. 436 II app. 514. Multiple children came forward to tell of abuse at the CDCand weresubsequently interviewed by the FBI. I app. 13. Later, an investigation of LTCAquinoand his wife also commenced.Plaintiff adopted Satanism as his religion and started the Temple of Set. KinseyAdams-Thompson’s father is an active-duty captain in the Army Chaplain Corps andwas a Baptist minister. I app. 12. Captain Adams-Thompson was familiar with andknew plaintiff and his Satanist beliefs when he was stationed at the samemilitary post,Presidio, California. II app. 409.In August 1987, Kinsey’s parents reported to the FBI that Kinsey has identifiedplaintiff and plaintiff’s wife while shopping at the Presidio PX. II app. 352.Plaintiff wason leave from his current duty station in St. Louis, MO. I app. 44.436 As evidenced in the [incomplete] Hickey notes (Appendix #12), Kinseyinitially denied [as she hadpreviously to the FBI] that Hambright had molested her. Only after repeatedinsistence by Hickey didKinsey say what Hickey wanted.- 654 -In January 1988, plaintiff made a written sworn statement denying theallegationsagainst him and preferring sworn charges against Captain Adams-Thompson, thechild’s father. II app. 301, 390. Plaintiff charged Captain Adams-Thompson withconduct unbecoming an officer because the Captain reported the allegations ofchildabuse to the San Francisco police. 437 Based on these sworn statements,plaintiff wasinvestigated for false swearing.In August 1988, the San Francisco district attorney’s office and FBI closedtheirinvestigations without filing any charges against plaintiff or anyone else. Iapp. 17.In September 1988 CID officials met with representatives from the SFPD, thelocaldistrict attorney’s office, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the FBI to discussthe status ofthe case. I app. 7. 438The investigation immediately received national and international attention invarious newspapers and tabloids. 439 In September and early October, plaintiffappearedon several nationally broadcasted TV talk shows including the “Geraldo RiveraShow”and “Oprah Winfrey Show.” II app. 117, 119.In October 1988 a CID Investigative Plan for plaintiff’s case was drafted inlight ofthe perceived weaknesses of the previous investigation. II app. 528. 440Also in October 1988 a staff aide to Senator Jesse Helms sent a letter to theSecretary of the Army complaining about plaintiff’s appearance on these TV showsabout Satanism and witchcraft. The staff aide asked for personal attention intothematter and raised the possibility of future Congressional hearings to considerlegislation. II app. 117-18. A subsequent letter was sent by Senator Helms totheSecretary in the same fashion in January 1989. II app. 119-20.437 Not “conduct unbecoming”, but rather “making a false official statement” [toinvestigators fromthe FBI/SFPD].438 So the CID would much later claim in order to imply that its investigationof me had pre-datedHelms’ communiqués to Secretary of the Army Marsh. However not a single piece ofdocumentationfrom either the CID or any of these other agencies was ever produced tosubstantiate this claim.439 This publicity refers to the FBI & SFPD investigations of A-T’s allegations,which were opened themoment he made them in August 1987. The Army CID’s investigation was not openeduntil November1988, post-Helms.440 There was no “Investigation Plan” - only a memo from Captain Harveysuggesting possible illegalways to try to incriminate me. No mention whatever was made in that letter of“perceivedweaknesses” or of any other investigation at all. See Appendix #66.- 655 -In November 1988 a high-level meeting took place in the Pentagon to discuss theAquino matter. II app. 121. The Judge Advocate General of the Army met withSenatorHelms to discuss the matter in early 1989. II app. 120. The Statute ofLimitations ranon all alleged crimes June 1989. I app. 12-13, 44-45.The Final ROI was issued in August 1989, determining that there was probablecause to title LTC Aquino and his wife with the above-noted offenses. I app. 44at n. 3,II app. 286.Mrs. Aquino was later dropped from the ROI on all charges on the basis ofinsufficient probable cause. II app. 287-288.Plaintiff was denied continued active-duty status as an AGR officer after aContinuation Board was informed of “flagged status” due to the investigation. Iapp. 12.Plaintiff appealed the ROI in January 1990. The Commanding General of the CIDadopted final recommendations on the ROI in September 1990, dropping some titledoffenses. Plaintiff remains titled for Conspiracy, Kidnapping, Sodomy, IndecentActsand False Swearing.Plaintiff filed his complaint in Federal District Court, Eastern District ofVirginia inNovember 1990.Introduction and Summary of ArgumentBy adopting the Army’s argument allowing a blanket exemption of itsinvestigatoryrecords to reject plaintiff’s request for amendment under the Privacy Act, thedistrictcourt has done significant damage to the language and structure of the Act andtheArmy’s own regulations. This holding must be overturned.The district court’s decision has effectively granted the Army an exemption notfound in the statute’s and regulations’ plain language. The result nullifiesCongress’intent to subject all agency rulemaking to the notice and comment requirements.Moreover the Army’s unprecedented liberal interpretation of the statute isinconsistent with every circuit, and contrary to the history and purpose of thePrivacyAct exemption provisions. This court must act firmly to correct this errorbecause thedistrict court’s holding is sweeping and categorical, and sets this circuit on apath atodds with clear judicial trends.Ryan and Wentz provide no support for the district court’s conclusion that thereasons for a Privacy Act exemption need not apply in each case. To thecontrary, Ryanhas been clarified and extended by other circuits to mean that the reasons for- 656 -exempting a system of records must affirmatively be demonstrated to be presentineach particular record for which exemption is invoked. Secondly, Wentz has beenharmonized with this judicial trend while limiting the case’s holding to itsunique facts.The clear judicial trend is to utilize standards developed under the Freedom ofInformation Act to determine whether records are exempt from access anddisclosureunder the Privacy Act. This circuit has consistently recognized this directionof the lawby adopting necessary precedents from other circuits. The facts of this casecall for thiscircuit to take the next logical step in that judicial trend and apply thesestandards tothe plaintiff’s request for amendment of his records under the Privacy Act.Accordingly, as we now show, the ROI plaintiff seeks to amend is not exemptunderthe Act and implementing Army regulation. Therefore the district court’sdecision mustbe reversed with instructions to apply the Privacy Act.Alternatively we also show that, if exempt under the Privacy Act, the districtcourterred in finding the Army’s refusal to amend the ROI not arbitrary andcapriciousunder the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court’s decision must bereversedwith instructions to consider all the relevant factors in its review of theArmy’s titlingaction, or to state its reasons for its findings.ArgumentI. The amendment provisions of the Privacy Act apply to the records inthis case.To reverse the district court’s holding rejecting Aquino’s request for amendmentof aReport of Investigation, this Court must first determine that the Privacy Actand theArmy’s regulation do not allow the Army to exempt itself from a civil actionseekingamendment or expungement of its Criminal Investigation and Crime Laboratoryrecords.A. The plain language of the Privacy Act and the Army’s own regulationprohibit the Army from exempting itself for a failure to amend orexpunge the ROI.1. The language of the Statute and Army regulation prohibit “BlanketExemptions” of law enforcement record systems.[Extensive, detailed, and source-cited legal text skipped here.]- 657 -... The language of subsection (j) (2) (B) of the Privacy Act states that agencyrecordsystems qualify for exemption only if courts and agencies have defined “lawenforcement purpose.”2. A law enforcement purpose is satisfied by passing the Pratt Testand by falling within the reasons stated in the agency’simplementing regulation.The Pratt test for “law enforcement purpose” was initially devised in a FOIAexemption 7 context by the D.C. Circuit. Pratt v Webster, 673 F.2d 408, 420-421(D.C.Cir. 1982). The case has broad applicability because it held “that federalagencies,including the FBI, must meet the threshold requirements of the exemption.” Id.at 416.Several circuits, including the 4th Circuit, have adopted the Pratt test inevaluatingexemption 7 of the FOIA.The Pratt test rejects an automatic blanket exception for the law enforcementexemption. The blanket exemption has also been referred to as the “per se rule”.Instead, the agency must make “a two-fold threshold showing, and then must showthat the document fits into one of the six subsections”. Freeman at 1122. Thisthresholdinquiry mandates analysis “in [each] case with respect to [each] investigativefile”.We first address the threshold requirements of the Pratt test.a. Part IThe threshold inquiry is the first half of the Pratt test, and consists of twocriteria.First, “the agency must demonstrate a connection between its investigation of anindividual and the existence of a possible ... violation of federal law”. JohnDo e at 1353citing Pratt 673 F.2d 420. Secondly, the “nexus between the investigation andone ofthe agency’s law enforcement duties must be based on information sufficient tosupport ... a colorable claim of its rationality”. Pratt at 421.This second requirement is not met where the agency offers a “pretextual orwhollyunbelievable” basis for a claim.A pretextual. basis exists when there is “evidencethat would suggest that the [agency] was motivated by anything other thangenuineinvestigatory concerns”. John Doe at 1354.In applying this threshold inquiry, the Privacy Act dictates a standard that allrecords concerning individuals be maintained “with such accuracy ... andcompletenessas is necessary to assure fairness”. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g) (1) (C). “The Act wasdesigned tocreate a code of fair information practices ....” Smiertke v U.S Dept. ofTreasury, 447 F.Supp. 221, 224 (D.D.C. 1978), remanded on other grounds, 604 F. 2d 698 (D.C.Cir.- 658 -1979). “An agency, we think it plain ... dishonors the Privacy Act standard of‘accuracy...necessary to assure fairness’ if it collects and keeps without carefulinvestigationderogatory information from unreliable sources or of a kind that could be run toearthwith a reasonable degree of certainty.” Jane Doe v U.S. 821 F.2d 694, 699 (D.C.Cir.1987) ( en banc) (court review of State Dept. refusal to amend ROI under PrivacyAct).The Jane Doe court also noted,The reasonable record-keeper, guided by a standard stressing fairness, should beparticularly vigilant in requiring independent, reliable verification ofundocumented,damaging bits of information gathered from third parties. Jane Do e at n. 14(emphasisadded) citing in support Doe v U.S Civil Service Comm’n 483 F. Supp. 539, 579-80(S.D.N.Y. 1980).Also particularly relevant to the present case, the court in Jane Doe stressedthat incertain cases involving “Communist associations, homosexual relations or childabuse[allegations are] generally susceptible of objective inquiry, so that an agencywould beremiss ... if it sought no independent verification. We have underscored thisverypoint.” Id. at n. 20 (rebuttal to dissent of Wald, C.J.) (emphasis added).In applying this threshold inquiry to agencies whose principle function is notlawenforcement, the courts have employed a more stringent test, so the “court mustscrutinize with some skepticism the particular purpose claimed for disputeddocumentsunder exemption.” Pratt at 418. These are “mixed-function agencies” such as theU.S.Army or National Labor Relations Board, whereas the FBI or Drug EnforcementAgency function principally as criminal law enforcement agencies.To fulfill the “nexus criteria” under this higher standard of scrutiny, the “lawenforcement purpose must relate to some type of formal proceeding, and one thatispending”. This “pending proceeding rule” has been construed to apply in the 4thCircuit in the FOIA exemption 7 context. The Pratt court concurred and foundthat formixed-function agencies to satisfy the law enforcement test, “it is necessaryfor theinvestigation to lead to a criminal prosecution or other enforcement proceeding....” Id.at 421, n. 33.We now turn to the second half of the Pratt test.b. Part IIThe second half of the Pratt test requires the agency to fit the records atissue withinone of six subsections. The subsections are the categories listed in FOIAExemption 7,and identify six types of disclosure-related harms deemed to be the only validreasonsfor the law enforcement exemption. Id. at 417.- 659 -Fitting the records at issue into one of the categories is a distinct element ofthePratt test.3. Proper analysis under Section (j) (2) of the Privacy Act utilizesstandards developed under the FOIA in determining whetherrecords are exempt from amendment.There is a clear judicial trend to apply legal standards developed under the lawenforcement exemption 7 of the FOIA to construe agency regulations underexemption(j) (2) of the Privacy Act.In Doe the court “borrowed” the Pratt test for law enforcement purposes, notingthe“test adapts well to the Privacy Act context because the language of subsection(k)(2),the more inclusive of the Act’s two exemption provisions, is virtually identicalto that ofFOIA exemption 7”.Moreover these courts applied the whole Pratt test in the Privacy Act context.JohnDoe at 1356 (“[I]n both contexts there is a threshold inquiry as to whetherdisputedmaterial is properly characterized as compiled for law enforcement purposes.”)Application of the Pratt test analogized the application of the six categoriesunderthe FOIA exemption 7 to application of the reasons requirements under § 552a(j).Exner at 1209; John Doe at 1356-57; Andrews at 1413-14.The only difference between the two exemptions is that under FOIA 7 the reasonsare expressly restricted by statute, while under § 552a(j) (2) Congress grantedagencies“broad discretion” to promulgate their reasons in exemption regulations.For example, the harms are listed under FOIA 7, so treatment of records is“fairlystraightforward”. However “(i]n creating subsections (j) and (k) of the PrivacyAct,Congress did not delineate the agency interests justifying exemption ....” JohnDoe at1357.Even though agencies possess discretion under the Privacy Act, the courts stillfoundthat “holding the [agencies] to the specific reasons stated in [their] exemptionregulation(s) ... fully appropriate” and “reflects Congress’ intent thatagencies onlyemploy Privacy Act exemptions where truly necessary”.a. The legal foundation for the judicial trend of applying FOIAstandards in the Privacy Act context was laid by the 4th Circuit inRyan and Local 2047.- 660 -The bedrock cases of Ryan and Local 2047 are responsible in part for thearticulation and extension of the Pratt doctrine and its application inconstruingexemptions under the Privacy Act.The Ryan rationale was directly relied on, its rationale followed or extended,by allcircuits confronting the issue. Exner at 1207, 1209, (citing Ryan apply FOIAstandardto Privacy Act exemption; reason for exemption must be consistent with reasonsinregulation); Fendler at 553 (agency must rely on reasons in regulations);Andrews at1411, 1413-1414 (citing Ryan to extend rationale to routine use of exemption;citedLocal 2047 to apply FOIA standards to interpret Privacy Act exemption); Nakashat1365 (citing Ryan); Castenda at 86 (applying reasons stated in regulations);John Doeat 1357 (apply FOIA standard to Privacy Act exemption; FBI rationale forexemptionmust be justified by reasons in regulations); Simon at 23 (agency must explainitsreasons in detail for each document to justify exemption, citing Exner);Tijerina at 796(reasons cited in regulation must be served to justify exemption from civilliability).The 4th Circuit is following the trend it set in Ryan and Local 2047 since ithasalready taken the necessary steps.First, by adopting the Pratt test in a FOIA exemption 7 context, the Circuitestablished the precursor to extending the test in a section (j) (2) context.Freeman at1123.Secondly, this Circuit has rejected the “blanket exemption” approach in a“reverse”FOIA exemption 4 case (has the same effect as a Privacy Act exemption fromaccess).Hercules v Marsh Secy. of the Army 839 F.2d 1027, 1029 (4th Cir. 1988) (reverseFOIAaction to enjoin U.S. Army by government contractor who claimed exemption fromaccess on statutory provision, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4)). In Hercules the courtfound thatmerely invoking exemption categories was insufficient since they were “not amandatory bar” to access. Id. at 1029. The court, after applying the Army’sregulationto the records at issue, held the exemption did not apply because its underlyingreasonshad not been satisfied. Id. at 1029-30 (failed to establish “likelihood of harm”fromdisclosure). Thus this Circuit should apply the Hercules FOIA standard to reject“blanket exemptions” in the Privacy Act context, or at least be consistent withitsunderlying principle when construing agency exemption regulations under the Act.Finally, several circuits have clarified and extended the Ryan and Local 204 7rulesto require the reasons for Privacy Act exemptions be affirmatively demonstratedto bepresent for each particular record. Although not binding upon this circuit,theirrationale is persuasive and thoroughly supported by the legislative history andpurposeunderlying the Privacy Act.- 661 -This development of the law calls for the logical extension of the Pratt test tothe (j)(2) law enforcement exemption of the Act. With this in mind we apply the Pratttest tothe facts in this case.4. The ROI fails to qualify for exemption under the Pratt test andreasons stated in the Army regulation.a. The plain language of the statute and regulation prohibit ablanket exemption.The district court adopted the Army’s argument that its regulation “hascompletelyexempted this entire system of records from the civil remedies provision of thePrivacyAct”. By accepting the Army’s remarkable proposition, the district court has ineffectallowed the Army to promulgate an exemption not found in the regulation’s plainlanguage: an automatic blanket exemption from amendment requests.The Army has not provided in its regulation any justification for completely andwholly exempting its investigatory records from the individual amendment requestprovision of subsection (d) of the Act, and this court should not condone such ausurpation of the rulemaking process.Instead of providing a blanket exemption, the Army’s regulation exempts a recordonly if amendment would have one of five adverse effects.No agency was granted a blanket exemption under the Privacy Act, not even theCentral Intelligence Agency, which must still subject portions of its entirerecordsystem to the reasons stated in its regulation.The district court, by adopting the Army’s proposition, also accepted itserroneousinterpretation of caselaw and flawed understanding of the Act and its ownregulation.The Army argued that the exemption justification need not apply to Aquino’sspecific amendment request, but may be invoked because it applies generally toallamendment requests, regardless of the particular facts in each case. The Armyrelies forthis contention not on the language of its regulation, which exempts onlyspecifiedrecords or files from amendment, or on cases that interpret similar regulationswith thestatute, but on cases discussing exemption provisions of the Act which permittheArmy to claim a general exemption for a system of records. I app. 48, 84-85,9192.If this Court were to accept the Army’s contention, it would sanction thewholesaleexemption of entire record systems, no matter how narrow or specific an agency’sstated justification for such exemption. Such an interpretation would eliminatethenecessity for the statutorily-mandated justification and render the notice andcomment- 662 -requirements of the Act a nullity. Indeed this argument, which amounts to ajustification for exemption stated only in this litigation, admits that theArmy’sregulation does not currently allow the maintenance of such a general exemption.The caselaw relied upon by the district court and Army to permit a blanketexemption does not stand for the proposition which they contend, nor have theyjustified their inconsistent interpretation of these cases.First, both completely ignored the May court’s holding that both harmonizedWentzwith other circuits and distinguished Wentz by limiting its application to itsuniquefacts. Furthermore, not only has Wentz never been followed, but the districtcourt’s andArmy’s interpretation is directly contradicted by the unanimity of caselaw fromothercircuits that has clearly rejected blanket exemptions.Secondly, Wentz cannot be relied upon in this case because it did not involve aninterpretation of the language of the agency’s regulation vis-à-vis the statute.For thesame reason, neither can the district court rely on Shapiro 721 F.2d 215 (7thCir. 1983),vacated on other grounds sub nom, U.S Dept. of Justice v Provenzano, 469 U.S. 14(1984) (consolidating Shapiro and Wentz No. 83-5878) (court found that issue wasmoot whether exemption (j) (2) of the Privacy Act was a withholding statuteunderexemption 3 of the FOIA by enactment of P.L. 98-477, 98 Stat. 22O9.The district court failed to recognize the broader implication of thelegislation thatmooted the question before the Supreme Court. The new law was enactedspecificallyto correct bad caselaw; to stop courts from reading Privacy Act exemption (j)(2) toobroadly.Shapiro can be distinguished on the same basis as Wentz: the holdings arelimitedby their unique facts. The Kimberlin court thus concluded in Shapiro “the reasongivenfor denying an individual access to his [DEA] files ... was found sufficientlyspecific tosatisfy the reason-giving requirement of § 552a(j) (2) ... because access tosuch recordswould alert a subject to the existence of an investigation ...”The Shapiro holding can be further limited to those agencies whose “principalfunction is law enforcement”, thus excluding mixed-function agencies such as theArmy. Shapiro at 217-18.However if the Shapiro case cannot be distinguished or its holding limited, thenit issimply wrong. The court’s broad interpretation is based merely on the labelattached tosection (j) (2) making it a “general” exemption as opposed to a “specific”exemption.This reasoning is untenable because it completely ignores other contextualelements ofthe statute and their interrelationship with the limiting language of theagency’sregulation. Id. at n. i. Secondly, the terms only mean that agencies have anoption to- 663 -exempt records from “specific” provision of the Act or from all provisions“generally”permitted.Finally, the district court and Army have distorted the Ryan holding byadvancingan interpretation inconsistent with every other circuit relying on the case.These othercircuits have clarified and extended Ryan to mean only that the rationale forexemptinga system of records must affirmatively be demonstrated to be present in eachparticularrecord.We next determine whether the Army’s rationale for exempting the ROI is presentinthis particular case. The appropriate standard of review for making thisdetermination,based on the Pratt test, is more rigorous than the deferential standard appliedtocriminal law agencies. In this case the Army is a mixed-function agency, so thecourt“must scrutinize with some skepticism the particular purpose claimed”. Pratt at418;Freeman at 1123. Finally, it is proper to challenge the “law enforcementpurpose” of theArmy under Pratt on appeal as the issue was fully preserved at the districtlevel.b. Part I - The ROI fails to qualify under the threshold inquiry.The Army fails to satisfy the first prong of the threshold inquiry because itsproffered evidence connecting Michael Aquino with the existence of a possibleviolationof federal law is tenuous at best, and entirely based on “undocumented, damagingbitsof information gathered from third parties”. Jane Doe at n. 14.The Army has plainly “dishonored the Privacy Act standard of accuracy ...necessaryto assure fairness” because it has collected and kept without carefulinvestigationderogatory information from unreliable sources without “requiring independent,reliable verification.” Jane Doe at 699, n. 14.Moreover, in cases involving child abuse, allegations are generally susceptibleofobjective inquiry, “so any agency would be remiss if it sought no independentverification.” Jane Doe at n. 20. Contrary to this standard, the Army’s ROIfinding ofprobable cause “connecting” Michael Aquino to crimes rests upon uncorroborated,third-party allegations, innuendo, and ignores critical exculpatory evidence.Thefinding flies in the face of the Army’s own regulations requiring the “qualityandquantity of all available evidence” be tested for both “relevancy andmateriality”.The factual record is replete with unverified information:(1) no evidence of physical abuse of Kinsey Adams-Thompson. I app. 13,11 app. 416-422;- 664 -(2) no evidence that Kinsey ever personally identified Michael Aquino as“Mikey” to any law enforcement agency by photo, lineup or otherwiseimmediately after her parents had alleged an identification was made whileshopping at the Presidio PX. Thus Kinsey’s parents’ statement of thealleged identification was not corroborated in any fashion, nor did anylaw enforcement agency ever attempt to investigate the identification scene forcorroborating witnesses. I app. 13, 15-16, 38, 62; II app. 520, 523;(3) Kinsey never identified Michael Aquino’s house. I. app. 16-17, 63; IIapp. 298 (item 4), 352;(4) no proof of authenticity of alleged copies of the diary, where theoriginal was lost, allegedly kept by the mother contemporaneously with events. Iapp. 13-14;(5) The Army chose to ignore Michael Aquino’s substantiated, absolutealibi defenses on dates of alleged criminal conduct. Marshal Affidavit, I app.24-27, II app. 102-04, 127-28 (painter performed work at crime scene onalleged day of crime); Butch Affidavit, I app. 27, II app. 258;(6) No evidence in the ROI of association, agreement, overt act orknowledge of other co-conspirator Gary Hambright. Mrs. Aquino wasdropped from the titling action for lack of probable cause. I app. 27, II app.300(item 4);(7) no corroboration from any other children interviewed on identity ofMichael Aquino or his residence. I app. 28, II app. 299 (item 4). And see“CID Investigative Plan: 17 Oct 1988 (requirement that other children identifyAquino from video lineup; requirement that “testimony of multiple children ...will factually corroborate the allegation.”). 528-29 (items 1(e), 2).Without establishing any shred of inculpatory evidence linking Michael Aquino toany crimes, the Army cannot reasonably conclude under the Pratt test that itsinvestigation has “demonstrated a connection between Aquino and the existence ofapossible violation of law.” Pratt at 420.The Army investigation fails to satisfy the “nexus to a colorable claim of itsrationality” because there is undisputed evidence suggesting a pretextual basisfor itstitling action. The factual record indicates that Army investigators andhigh-levelofficials “were motivated by other than genuine investigatory concerns” and thusorchestrated a “campaign of appeasement” to remove Michael Aquino from the Army.- 665 -First, a highly-publicized and thorough investigation of the same case by theFBIand San Francisco Police Department in August 1988 was terminated after findingnoprobable cause. No charges were filed. I app. 17.The following October Senator Jesse Helms viewed Mr. Aquino on several TV talkshows. Senator Jesse Helms then pressured the Army’s highest officials tospecificallyget rid of Michael Aquino or risk embarrassing “Congressional hearings into thismatter to consider appropriate legislation ....” I app. 17-20 (letters fromstaff aide andSenator).In November the Army CID investigation was initiated on the simple premise thatthe FBI and SFPD investigation “was deficient”. I app. 20.On November 29, 1988 a high-level meeting took place at the Pentagon to discussthe Aquino matter and included seven senior Army and Defense Dept. officials andCongressional liaison officers. I app. 21. These officials adopted a policy ofappeasement with Senator Helms. The solution was to deny Michael Aquinocontinuation as an AGR officer and to title him without ever charging him. Themethodwas to allow the statute of limitations to run prior to titling, and use it asan excuse toavoid a public trial likely to end in acquittal. Discontinuation from AGR statuswaseffected by improperly including reference to the investigation in theContinuationBoard’s review. I app. 21, II app. 264-66.The second. pretextual grounds for the investigation point to Kinsey’s parentsas theonly other moving force. This conclusion is inescapable because no otherchildreninterviewed by the FBI, SFPD, or Army CID ever corroborated identification ofMichael Aquino and his residence. I app. 28-29. Also significant was that priorto anyinvestigation, Kinsey’s father, an Army chaplain, knew Michael Aquino and hisbelief inSatanism as both were stationed at the Presidio Army Post. I app. 13, II app.409.As a result of applying the rigorous standard of review to the evidence, itcannot beconcluded that the Army investigation leading to a titling action constituted alegitimate law enforcement purpose under the Pratt threshold inquiry. The Army’slawenforcement purpose is at best questionable, and certainly could not meet theprobablecause standard stated in its own regulation.c. Part III - The ROI fails to satisfy the reasons stated in the Army’sregulation.Assuming the ROI satisfies the Pratt threshold inquiry, it still fails toqualify underthe “law enforcement purpose” test because it does not “fall within” one of thereasonsstated in the Army’s regulation. 32 C.F.R. § 505.5(2), (4)(a)-(g).- 666 -It is fully appropriate to hold the Army “to the specific reasons stated in itsexemption regulation” and to allow exemption only if, and to the extent,amendmentwould result in one of the specified listed harms. John Doe at n. 17.The Army is also limited to those exemption reasons which it has filed andexplained, and cannot claim new ones in this lawsuit to serve a purpose not thesubjectof a prior rulemaking process.The Army must make an affirmative showing that amendment of the ROI wouldresult in one of the harms listed in its regulation; “bare conclusoryallegations are notsufficient”. Irons at 471. The Army, however, has ignored this requirement,offeringonly a bare-bones argument that the whole record system is exempt regardless ofthenature of the documents therein.Finally, since the Army is a mixed-function agency, the ROI must relate to sometypeof formal, pending proceeding.The Army regulation provides five justifications for immunizing the ROI from theaccess and amendment provisions of subsection (d). The regulation mirrorsexemption7 of the FOIA, and recites the adverse effects that disclosure would have uponlawenforcement. 32 C.F.R. § 505.5(2)(4)(b).The first adverse effect is that disclosure and amendment would harm “ongoinginvestigations”. As the FBI conceded in Doe, the Army must here concede thattheseaccess-related concerns do not apply where “the agency refuses to expungeinformationthat has already been disclosed to the person seeking expungement”. John Doe at1357.Moreover,this justification has nothing to do with the circumstances of thiscase. Mr.Aquino knew he was being investigated and did not file an amendment requestuntilafter he was titled and the ROI was sitting in completed form at the CrimeRecordsCenter. I app. 61-62. The rationale for this exemption protects the ROI prior toitscompletion and during related ongoing investigations, but there is no necessityfor suchan exemption when the ROI is revealed, the titling action is completed and noallegations of ongoing investigations or pending, formal proceedings have beenmade.NLRB at 232; Masonic Homes at 18-19. Nor is the “mere hypothetical possibilityof afuture enforcement proceeding sufficient” to bring the disclosed ROI within alawenforcement purpose. Lame v U.S. Dept. of Justice, 645 F.2d 917, 920 (3rd Cir.1981)(rule applied to mixed-function agencies). This principle flows from theremedialpurpose of the Privacy Act which requires all records maintained by an agency,not justthose “immediately needed”, to be accurate, timely, relevant and complete.” R.R.vDept. of the Army, 482 F. Supp. 770, 774 (D.D.C. 1980).None of the other justifications listed in the Army regulation apply to thiscase, norhas the Army alleged any reasons consistent with these justifications to exemptthe- 667 -ROI from amendment. In effect the Army is asking this court to accept anunprecedented liberal interpretation of the Act and its regulation: namely theArmymaintains that any amendment of investigatory records in its CID system,whateverthe nature of information collected and no matter what length of time recordshave been maintained, would in all cases be exempt. This contention overstatestheArmy’s Privacy Act statutory duty to assure fairness by verifying differingaccounts ofevents against the factual record. Jane Do e at 701, (D.C. Cir. 1987) ( enbanc).This court should overturn the district court’s decision accepting thisunprecedentedinterpretation of the Army’s exemption regulation and the Privacy Act. The courtshould also find that the Army has not met its burden to qualify its ROI withinthe “lawenforcement purpose” exemption (j) (2), and remand with instructions to applytheamendment provisions of the Privacy Act.II. Even if the ROI is exempt, the District Court improperly applied theAdministrative Procedure Act’s review standard of “arbitrary andcapricious”. 5 U.S.C. 706(2) (A)A. The district court abused its discretion by failing to state the reasonsfor Its decision in finding the Army’s action not arbitrary andcapricious.The district court failed to adequately explain the reasons why it found the CIDdecision not to remove Michael Aquino’s name from the title block not arbitraryandcapricious. This appellate court’s institutional interest in reviewabilitydemandsarticulation of the district court’s reasons. Farmington Dowel Products Co. vForsterMgf. Co. 436 F.2d 699, 701-02 (1st Cir. 1970).Under this standard of review of arbitrary and capricious, the district courtmustmake a searching and careful inquiry in determining whether the Army took a“hardlook” at all relevant factors when it titled Michael Aquino. Citizens to ProtectOvertonPark v Volpe, Sec’y of Transportation, 401 U.S. 402, 417 (1971) (hereinafterOvertonPark). Hutto Stockyard In. v U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 903 F.2d 299, 305 (4thCir.1990).This judicial inquiry must include “the whole record” to ensure the Army’sdecisionwas not a clear error of judgment. However the Supreme Court in Overton Parkcautioned that “since the bare record may not disclose the factors that wereconsideredor the [agency’s] construction of the evidence, it may be necessary for theDistrict Courtto require some explanation in order to determine if the [agency] acted withinthescope of [its] authority”.- 668 -The district court, however, ignored this principle by providing only general,conclusory statements withoutpointing to any specific factors relied upon by theArmy to title Michael Aquino. Without any visible, underlying basis for itsconclusions,the court merely recites excerpts of the Army’s Brief, “[t]he facts support ...the CIDdecision ... there was substantial evidence from which the Army decision-makercoulddetermine probable cause ....”Neither did the district court address whether its consideration of relevantfactorsincluded application of the Army’s own regulations.Since Michael Aquino’s case was dismissed on summary judgment, the absence ofany discussion of relevant factors is remarkable. The district court’s lack ofreasons iseven more startling, considering that a finding of probable cause under the ROIin thiscase, is equivalent to a criminal indictment involving five felonies.As a result of the district court’s failure to state its reasons for findingthat theArmy’s decision was not arbitrary and capricious, this court has insufficientbasis onwhich to review its decision. The district court’s order granting summaryjudgment forthe Army must be vacated, and the case remanded with instructions that thedistrictcourt adequately explain its reasons for affirming the Army’s finding ofprobable causein the ROI involving Michael Aquino.B. Assuming reasons were sufficiently stated by the district court, theArmy is not afforded considerable deference when it is acting outsideits special function.The district court adopted the Army’s argument that under the arbitrary andcapricious review standard, “the Army decision-maker is (traditionally) affordedconsiderable deference.”On examination, these cases do not really help the Army, rather they can bedistinguished as all involving appeals from Boards of Military Records fromwithin thevarious branches of the military. These cases involve agencies acting pursuantto theirenabling statutes, and thus are “entitled to considerable deference whenexercising[their] special functions of applying general provisions of the Act to thecomplexities of[internal activities]”. NLRB v Brow n 380 U.S. 278, 291-292 (1965), quoted U.S.Dept.of Health and Human Services v FLRA 844 F.2d 1.087, 1094 (4th Cir. 1988).The present case, however, involves a direct appeal from the Army CID to aFederalDistrict Court pursuant to law enforcement activities, thus there is no specialfunctionor expertise entitling the Army decision-makers “considerable deference”. TheArmy inthis case is operating outside of its primary function, acting as amixed-functionagency, whereas in the cases above, the agencies’ activities clearly fell withinthe- 669 -military services’ enabling statutes. The present case is an action broughtindependentof any enabling statutes, under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g).1. The district court failed to consider pre-decisional bias in the titlingaction as a relevant factor.Since the Army’s decision refusing to amend the ROI is not entitled to specialdeference, the court must take a “hard look” at the “whole record” ensuring thatallrelevant factors were considered.Relevant factors would necessarily include any procedural requirements and any“unique” or “extraordinary” circumstances having an adverse effect on thetitlingaction. Overton at 412-413 (“truly unusual factors in a particular case ...reachedextraordinary magnitudes” thus it was appropriate to justify giving weight tothatfactor” quoted in Maryland Wildlife Federation v Dole 747 F.2d 229, 244 (4thCir.1984) (Winter, J. dissenting) (noting the majority’s consideration of unique andextraordinary circumstances as relevant factors under the APA arbitrary andcapriciousreview standard).Such an example would be pre-decisional bias, particularly when there isevidencesuggesting that high-ranking deciders within the agency, or other outside,inappropriately effected the impartiality of the process. See FTC v CementInstitute,333 U.S. 683 (1948); Gilligan, Will & Co. v SEC 267 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.) cert.denied, 361U.S. 896 (1959) (circuit decision is the most frequently quoted test for bias:“whether adisinterested observer may conclude that the agency has in some measure adjudgedthefacts as well as the law of a particular case in advance of hearing it.”)Such is the present case, where there is undisputed, substantial evidencepointing toimproper influence and political pressure exerted on the titling process byCongressional officials and staff and high-ranking Army officials not normallyinvolvedin criminal investigations. I app. 17-22. The bias resulted from a concertedeffort ofappeasement of the Army in response to Senator Jesse Helms. Senator Helms, whoafter seeing Michael Aquino on several TV talk shows, decided that the Army mustgetrid of the officer. There is undisputed evidence that the Secretary of the Armyand otherhigh-level officials were personally involved in management and oversight of thetitlingaction. I app. 17-19. The appeasement was to avoid embarrassing Congressionalhearings on “this matter” threatened by the Senator. I app. 18-19. The evidenceof pre-decisional bias is even more convincing because prior to commencement of the CIDinvestigation, the FBI and San Francisco police had completed theirinvestigation of thesame matter without filing any charges, indictments or making any arrests. Iapp. 17.Despite the undisputed, substantial evidence of predecisional bias, the districtcourt’s opinion makes no reference to it. Nor does the opinion even hint that it- 670 -considered bias as a relevant factor in its review of the Army’s action refusingto amendthe titling action. Nor does the Army dispute in its Brief the existence ofCongressionalinfluence and involvement by high-level Army officials.It is quite probable that in response to the unexpected publicity andcongressionalintervention in this particular case, the Army decided to amend its Access andAmendment Refusal Authority regulation to delegate responsibility for handlingsuchrequests under the Privacy Act. This amendment was filed five weeks afterMichaelAquino’s trial hearing (or six months after filing his complaint).The delegation to much lower level supervisors suggests that the Army now seekstoavoid further high-profile Privacy Act requests by adding another layer ofreview while“keeping a lid” on potentially embarrassing requests. Moreover this recentchangeremoves higher-level officials from the opportunity to exert pre-decisionalbias. Thetiming of this Army amendment with the filing of this complaint and pastnotorietysuggests that the Army did recognize some degree of inappropriate activity inPrivacyAct requests in general.In sum, the district court failed to consider the relevant factor ofpre-decisional biasin its review of the Army’s titling action. This court should vacate thedistrict court’sorder for summary judgment and remand with instructions to consider all relevantfactors, or to adequately state its reasons why it chose not to consider thisfactor.ConclusionFor the foregoing reasons, the district court’s grant of summary judgmentrejectingplaintiff’s Privacy Act amendment request should be reversed, and the caseshould beremanded with instructions to apply the Act’s amendment provisions.Alternatively, the district court erred in finding the Army’s refusal to amendthe ROInot arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. Thedistrictcourt’s decision should be reversed with instructions to consider all therelevant factorsin its review of the Army’s titling action, or to state its reasons for itsfindings.Respectfully submitted,/s/ Gary Myers, Esq./s/ John A. Wickham, Esq.Gary Myers and AssociatesAttorneys for Appellant Michael Aquino- 671 -Appendix 71: TJAG/CID Court of Appeals Brief Statements AnalysisFalse Official Statements by Major Patrick Lisowski to theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth CircuitCase #91-1164Cited in the Opinion of the Court on February 26, 1992- identified as of March 23, 1992 by Lt.Col. Michael A. Aquino -[The following statements by the court in its published opinion are identifiedin regular type to pages in that decision, and then in Italics to falsestatements by Lisowski in his brief relied upon by the court to reach thatdecision. Where no Italics are cited, comments relate to documents providedas “truthful” by Lisowski to the court. This analysis is not a complete listingof all false statements by Lisowski in the brief, but rather of only those whichwere singled out by the court for reference in its Opinion.]1.Page 2: “Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino, formerly of the U.S. Army Reserves…” Page 11: “Appellant-Plaintiff Michael A. Aquino was a Lieutenant Colonel inthe United States Army Reserve; he is now retired from the Army.”A.I remain a Lieutenant Colonel in the the Active/Selected U.S. Army Reserve.This false statement by Lisowski clearly conveys the impression that I waseither forced out of the Reserve or voluntarily retired from it due to thisscam.B.The obvious implication is that my suit is less important because I am nolonger a serving officer, and that all parts of the Army accepted and agreedwith the CID’s fraudulent report.C.The truth is that I refused to allow my career to be terminated by the scam. Mychain of command agreed with me, continuing throughout the investigationand subsequent to the titling to issue me officer efficiency reports of thehighest evaluation, and with special commendation of my moralstandards.D.After the fraudulent titling action my file was unflagged, I served theremainder of my scheduled AGR tour, and went on to my present assignmentin the USAR as an Individual Mobilization Augmentee in the Selected Reserve.- 672 -2.Page 3: “Although the SFPD discontinued its investigation of the Aquinos inSeptember 1988 for lack of sufficient evidence, the CID continued …” Page 15:“InSeptember 1988 CID investigators met with representatives from the SFPD, theU.S. Attorney’s Office, and the FBI to discuss the status of the investigation.”Page22: “The record shows that the CID’s plans for the investigation … wereinitiatedin October 1988, well before the Army received a letter from Senator Helms’office.”A.In fact the CID did not “continue” an investigation of Mrs. Aquino and myself,but initiated it on November 23, 1988 following the Helms pressure. The8/12/88 date (revised from the earlier-attempted CID ROI falsehood of 9/88)is to try to narrow the inconvenient gap between the closing of the SFPDinvestigation and the Geraldo Rivera/Senator Helms-driven opening of theCID investigation. In fact the actual date when the SFPD District Attorney’sOffice announced that no charges would be filed against me was 8/1/88.Therefore the CID investigation was opened almost four months after theSFPD investigation was closed. Moreover the FBI never announced anyinvestigation of us whatever. This is clearly a fraudulent attempt by Lisowskito imply an “unbroken chain of investigation” in which the Army’s actionswere endorsed by the FBI. Such was not the case.B.The sole document produced by the CID to suggest that an investigation wasunderway prior to Helms’ influence was a 10/17/88 letter by Major Harveysuggesting ways to manipulate a lineup and court-martial in order to obtain aconviction, and proposing illegal use of Inspector General subpœnas.•As the CID investigation was not authorized and opened until11/23/88, by what authority and under whose directions was Harveyproposing such manipulation and illegal subpœnas?•If, as Lisowski states, CID plans for the investigation were initiated a monthprior to that investigation’s being officially authorized, it would be mostinteresting to see the entire paper trail … to include the signatures of thosepersons who instigated it. Why didn’t Lisowski produce those complete“CID plans”? Why are none of them contained or even mentioned in theROI as exhibits? Why was there no mention whatever of Harvey’s“supposedly-significant” 10/17/88 letter in the ROI?3.Page 3: “… and the applicable 3-year statute of limitations had expired in June1989.” [Lisowski, district court brief, page 9:] “The final Report ofInvestigation(ROI) was issued on August 11, 1989. G.E. D at 1-4. On January 4, 1990 MajorHarvey spoke with the staff judge advocate at Fort Leonard Wood, MO todetermine what action the commander of Fort Leonard Wood had decided to take- 673 -in the case. The commander took no action against plaintiff as a result of theinvestigation. G.E. B at 3.”A.My attorney Mr. Gary Myers was informed by TJAG that the decision not tocourt-martial me was made prior to the titling decision (i.e. prior toAugust 1989). In that case the account of the “decision by the Fort LeonardWood commander on 1/4/90” is false, intended as a cover-up of the illegalconduct of the investigation process.B.On 10/2/89 the flag was removed from my personnel file at ARPERCEN. Sucha flag would have remained in place unless a decision had already beenmade that there would be no charges preferred against me.C.Lisowski’s account is thus false and obstructs justice by concealing thisadditional misuse of investigatory/court-martial procedures.4.Page 3: “… on the grounds that the identifications of her by the children wereinadequate …” [Lisowski, district court interrogatories, page 37:] “The decisiontodelete Mrs. Aquino from the subject block was based upon Kinsey’s inability topick Mrs. Aquino out of the video lineup. On 8/12/87 Kinsey identified Mrs.Aquino as ‘Shamby’. However, Mrs. Aquino’s proximity to LTC Aquino whenviewed by Kinsey Adams-Thompson in the Presidio Post Exchange parking lotmade this identification too suggestive to be reliable by itself. The defendantbelieves that Mrs. Aquino is the most likely suspect to be ‘Shamby’. Howeverthisbelief falls slightly short of ‘probable cause’. During the video lineup,Kinsey’sstatement that woman #2 was ‘Shamby’ indicates that Kinsey believed a womanof very similar appearance to Mrs. Aquino was ‘Shamby’. Defendant has givenMrs. Aquino the benefit of the doubt. It is possible that a female of similardescription to Mrs. Aquino was involved in the ritual sexual abuse of KinseyAdams-Thompson at 123 Acme without the participation of Mrs. Aquino. In"},{"pageContent":"recognition of this possibility, the Commanding General of CID decided to removeMrs. Aquino from the title block. Defendant does not believe plaintiff actedalone.Defendant believes plaintiff acted with Mr. Gary Hambright and with otherunnamed and identified persons, who may include Mrs. Aquino.”A.“Identifications” = plural? “Children” = plural? There is not a single“identification” of Mrs. Aquino by any child in the ROI - only the“identification by Kinsey Almond” alleged by the adult Adams-Thompsons.B.If the decision to delete Mrs. Aquino’s name from the titling had indeed beenbased on Almond’s “inability to pick Mrs. Aquino out of the video lineup” ,then Mrs. Aquino would not have been titled in the original ROI. On 8/12/87it is again only the allegation by the adult Adams-Thompsons that the “PX- 674 -parking lot identification” ever occurred, and the numerous changes,inconsistencies, and fabrications in their accounts - known to the CID -eliminate that altogether as a reliable account. [See Chaplain Adams-Thompson’s Actions in Violation of Article 133 UCMJ, 11/29/89, #C, #37-59.]C.“Mrs. Aquino’s proximity to LTC Aquino when viewed by Kinsey Adams-Thompson in the Presidio Post Exchange parking lot made this identificationtoo suggestive to be reliable by itself.”As a matter of fact ( A-T UCMJ #133 Violations, items #50-57), the A-Ts are100% inconsistent as to when anyone saw Mrs. Aquino anywhere. As far as the“proximity to LTC Aquino” dodge is concerned, Michele A-T specified in her4/10/89 CID statement that Lilith was standing next to our car “alone” whenthey first saw her and Almond made her alleged “ID” of her. [And, as Mrs.Aquino and I had been constantly together in the PX, why wouldn’t Almondhave “IDd” her at the same time as she “did” me?]D.“The defendant believes that Mrs. Aquino is the most likely suspect to be‘Shamby’.”“Shambee” (Hickey’s spelling):•appears in the Hickey notes first on 1/27/87, introduced by Almond as “herfriend at school” who was spanked by Mr. Rogers on TV. Almond addedthat Shambee “also had its neck broken”, indicating that “Shambee” iseither an imaginary “friend” or perhaps a doll.•There is no record of the FBI/SFPD/CID interviewing either teachers orother children at the Presidio day-care center to see if anyone used or wasknown by the name “Shambee”.•There is no mention of “Shambee” by any other child.•On 4/7/87 Almond said that Shambee and Sassy were the same person, andthat Sassy was Todo’s girlfriend. After this neither Almond nor Hickey usedthe name “Shambee” anymore, discussing only “Sassy”.•“Shambee” is reintroduced as “Mikey’s wife” by Michele A-T on 6/30/87.•On 7/7/87 Almond told Hickey that “Nancy and Shambee were goodmothers”- 675 -•On 7/7/87 Hickey asked Almond if Shambee worked at the school.Almond’s answer - and anything else she may have said as a follow-up onthe next three pages of Hickey’s record - has been concealed by theCID.On page #8 of his brief to the district court, Lisowski stated the following“significance” of “Shamby”: “Kinsey stated that ‘Shamby’ and ‘Mr. Gary’ tookher to ‘Mr. Gary’s house’ and that ‘Mikey’ was there.” Every element of thisaged (almost three years from the “CID-invented re-dating” of May-June1986) statement has changed along the way in an effort to make it “fit”revealed facts:•In her 1/14/87 FBI interview, Almond said nothing about being takenanywhere by anyone or having anything done to her at all. Since this denialwas obviously unacceptable to her parents, she was immediately placed in“therapy” with Hickey, the official abuse-finder for the Presidio scam.•By the third (2/3/87) “play session”, Almond now announced that she hadperformed fellatio on “Mr. Gary” at the CDC. There is no mention of goinganywhere else, or of any other adult being involved.•It took Hickey and the A-Ts two more months to get Almond to agree to anoff-CDC location. Finally on 4/7/87 Hickey asked Almond twice if she everwent anywhere with Hambright. Both times Almond said no. When Hickeyrefused to accept these answers, Almond only then said yes - to “Sassy’shouse”. In the same session Almond described the house as “blue” and thebathtub as “blue” (neither correct in the case of 123 Acme).•There is no mention of “Mikey” by Almond whatever, at “the house” oranywhere else, for over two more months of “therapy”. On 6/2/87 MicheleA-T proposes a “Satanic cult”, and then on 6/30/87 Michele introduces“Mikey” as “Shambee’s husband” and a military officer.•On 6/2/87 and 6/9/87 Almond said that the man at the house withHambright was “Dr. Steve”. As it turns out, “Dr. Steve” is the only realperson specifically and repeatedly identified by Almond as being at thehouse with Hambright. Michele admitted that “Dr. Steve” was a neighbor oftheirs at the Presidio of San Francisco. Neither Hickey [per her notes] norMichele reported this identification to the FBI/CID/SFPD. There is norecord that “Dr. Steve” was ever questioned, served with a search warrant,or titled on the strength of this authentic, unsolicited identificationby Almond.- 676 -•Clearly Lisowski’s succinct statement, which includes no mention of thisextensive coaching and revision whatever, is false and misleading.E.“During the video lineup, Kinsey’s statement that woman #2 was ‘Shamby’indicates that Kinsey believed a woman of very similar appearance to Mrs.Aquino was ‘Shamby’.”•CID regulation 195-1 states that “the persons portrayed in the photographsshould be reasonably similar in appearance.” Lisowski states here that evenif Mrs. Aquino was not selected in a lineup, the mere fact that someone elseon the same lineup was selected implies the selection of Mrs. Aquino!In this case the lineup technique is totally invalid, as there is no way for anytargeted person to survive it.•Numerous other violations of CID regulation 195-1 were committed, andignored by the CID & TJAG, in this case. [See False Official Statements byMajor Patrick Lisowski to the U.S. District Court. ]F.“It is possible that a female of similar description to Mrs. Aquino wasinvolved in the ritual sexual abuse of Kinsey Adams-Thompson at 123 Acmewithout the participation of Mrs. Aquino. In recognition of this possibility,the Commanding General of CID decided to remove Mrs. Aquino from thetitle block.”• “Possibility” clearly does not equate to “probable cause”.•Even so, evidence has shown that it was impossible for Almond to havebeen “ritually sexually abused at 123 Acme” , as she shows no signs of any“abuse” except as coached into her by Hickey and her parents, there are novalid “identifications” of either the interior or exterior of 123, the Aquinoswere in Washington, D.C. at the originally-alleged date, and on the CID-invented-backdate there were two separate, uncontested witnessstatements that no children were present anywhere in 123.•If Mrs. Aquino is removed as a suspect, then her sworn statement that shewas also present with Lt.Col. Aquino on the CID-invented-backdate andthat no children were present, or molested anywhere at any time,constitutes a third uncontested witness statement.•The Commanding General of CID did not “decide to remove Mrs. Aquinofrom the title block” . According to my attorney, who was in regular contactwith the CID at this time, the CID’s legal counsel informed myattorney that he had recommended total expungement of all- 677 -titlings. In defiance of this, the decision to make only a partialexpungement was made by Colonel Francis A. Gilligan, Chief, Criminal LawDivision TJAG, on 7/30/90 and was merely obediently accepted by theCID.•• According to the TJAG chronology, this is the same Colonel Gilligan whoon 12/5/88 was bypassing the UCMJ authority at Fort Leonard Wood towork directly with Lt.Col. Schwender at the Presidio, in apparentcontradiction of the TJAG paper proposing “no top-down guidance” [see#13 below]. Since Gilligan had a vested interest in defending aninvestigation in which he personally had been involved from thebeginning, his resistance to expunging it is understandable.•In fact Mrs. Aquino was originally titled by the CID simply because it wasthought useful to do so in order to reinforce the predetermined fraudulenttitling of myself, destroy her inconvenient presence as a witness to myinnocence, and further intimidate me by creating a dangerous threat to mywife.•In fact the titling of Mrs. Aquino was removed only when TJAG realizedthat a federal lawsuit was imminent. The titling of civilians by the CID isexpressly prohibited by Department of Defense Directive #5525.7,Appendix #3, and obviously TJAG was not enthusiastic about having theCID violation exposed in court.G.“Defendant believes plaintiff acted with Mr. Gary Hambright and with otherunnamed and identified persons, who may include Mrs. Aquino.” There is noevidence whatever - apart from the adult Adams-Thompsons’ unsupportedallegations - connecting Mrs. Aquino or myself with Gary Hambright in anyway.5.Page 3: “… the evidence of alibi offered by LTC Aquino was not persuasive.”A.This quotes a statement in Colonel Gilligan’s 7/30/90 letter to the CID. Thisspecifically refers to a deposition by a commercial painter, Graham Marshall,who was present in the our flat with Mrs. Aquino and myself on the CID-invented-backdate and verified that there were no children there at any time.In order to get around this inconvenient alibi, the CID’s Major Harveytelephoned Marshall and said, “Let me propose a scenario, and you tellme if there is anything that wouldn’t fit. I mean this is a possiblescenario. I am not asking you to say whether you think that thishappened or not. ” Harvey then proposed to Marshall that a child could- 678 -have been taken into the downstairs (Butch) apartment. Marshall said, “It’sconceivable.”B.Harvey’s speculative invention of another location, not supported by anyevidence whatever from Marshall or anyone else, is the only basis for the “notpersuasive” claim by Gilligan.C.On 4/4/91 William Butch, a professional civilian security officer and aCommander USNR, resident of the Harvey-invented apartment, provided asworn affidavit verifying that he had been home the entire day and there wereno children present there either. Commander Butch’s affidavit was neverchallenged or refuted by the CID; it was simply ignored by Lisowskialtogether in his attempts to defend the CID/TJAG - a clear act ofobstruction of justice in violation of #134 UCMJ.6.Page 3-footnote: “In 1990 a continuation board of the Army Reserve recommendeddiscontinuing Aquino’s service in the Reserve, and he was processed out of theArmy.” Page 11: “Appellant-Plaintiff Michael A. Aquino was a Lieutenant Colonelin the United States Army Reserve; he is now retired from the Army.” [Lisowski,district court interrogatories, page 31:] “There is no record reflecting whethertheAGR Continuation Board knew of plaintiff’s flagging or a CID investigation.”A.I remain a Lieutenant Colonel in the the Active/Selected U.S. Army Reserve.[See #1A-D above.]B.Indeed there is a record showing corruption of the AGR Board by TJAG, andLisowski knew of its existence. It is Exhibit #M in my originaladministrative appeal of the fraudulent titling, and consists of an officialTJAGchronology of the investigation. The entry for 1/24/89 states: “MAJ Phillips,ARPERCEN Command Judge Advocate, related that a continuation board washeld and that the board did ask if LTC Aquino was flagged. The response wasaffirmative.” Provision of such information to the board by MAJ Phillips wasin violation of AR 135-18 and the OCAR LOI to the board, which specificallyprovides that the OMPF (which does not include flagging actions) be used asthe basis for evaluation. The provision of flagging information to the board byTJAG was clearly an effort - and a successful one - to prejudice the board’sdecision in my case.C.In Tim Tate’s Children For the Devil Major Harvey, CID Judge Advocate forthe investigation, is quoted: “We aren’t going to force a court martial in thiscase … [Aquino’s] secondment to the Regular Army is ending; we just won’trenew his contract, so in effect we are getting rid of him that way.” Anexplicit- 679 -acknowledgment of the manipulation and misuse of the AGR continuationboard process and purpose in violation of AR 135-18.7.Page 6: “… based on a legitimate concern that federal laws have been or may beviolated.” Page 18: “The evidence in the record clearly supports thedeterminationthat there is probable cause to believe that Michael Aquino sexually molested achild.” Page 40: “Despite plaintiff’s contentions, this investigation was not a‘witchhunt’. The sole reasons for the investigation and the CID decision totitleplaintiff are the facts demonstrating that plaintiff sexually abused youngchildren.”A.As is clear from the disclosure of the Hickey notes, all exposed anddocumented behavior of the Adams-Thompsons prior to the opening of theCID investigation, and the medical findings showing Almond to be a virginwith no medical signs whatever of molestation, there was never such a“legitimate concern” by the CID. They knew from the outset that we wereinnocent. The entire conduct of the investigation consisted of anattempt to conceal or ignore all evidence substantiating ourinnocence, and to manufacture “evidence” to support thefraudulent titling. There were and are no facts “demonstrating thatplaintiff sexually abused young children”. See (1) Adams-Thompson’sViolations of #133 UCMJ, (2) ROI cover letter analysis, and (3) ROI Summaryof Significant Information analysis.B.No better example of the predetermined bias and agenda of the investigationcan be given than the 10/17/88 letter from Major Harvey - prior to theopening of the supposedly “unbiased” investigation - proposing waysto manipulate a video lineup and an eventual court-martial to secure aconviction. There is no mention whatever of any possibility that aninvestigation might prove our innocence.•This same Major Harvey on 12/14/88 wrote to my attorney: “If LTC Aquinohas not committed these offenses, USACIDC hopes to establish hisinnocence and assist in clearing his name … If LTC Aquino provides certainleads or evidence that shows the allegations to be without merit, I willinsure that USACIDC personnel follow those leads, to the maximumpossible extent, in order to properly document his innocence.”•All such exculpatory evidence and leads provided were ignoredor concealed in order to fabricate the titling and cover up theactual UCMJ violations by Adams-Thompson, Hickey, and CID/TJAG investigatory personnel.- 680 -C.Lisowski deliberately specifies the word “children” (plural) to imply that therewere multiple “victims” - which is not even alleged by the fraudulent ROI.8.Page 8: “… the testimony of [Almond] that ‘Mikey’ had sexually molested her …”A.There was no mention by Almond of a “Mikey” whatever, anywhere, anytimeuntil Michele Adams-Thompson introduced the name and militaryassociation in the 6/30/87 Hickey session. Everything that Almond herselfthen said to Hickey about “Mikey” she had previously said randomly aboutmany other people and objects. Thereafter it is a simple case of Michelecontinuing to coach her daughter to use the name and allegations in an effortto support the desired framing of the Satanist officer and his wife she and herhusband knew about and had decided to victimize.9.Page 8: “… on her identifications of Aquino as ‘Mikey’ …” Page 12: “In additiontothe identification at the post exchange, Kinsey identified plaintiff out of afive-person photo-lineup and video lineup.”A.The adult Adams-Thompsons’ ever-mutating accounts of the “PXidentification” make it obvious that it was merely their invention, not an“identification”. [It is impossible for it to have been an identification, sincewe have never seen the child and to this day have no idea what she lookslike.]B.Almond made no “identifications” of me whatever until she was shown anillegally-designed photo-lineup by the CID 1-1/2 years later, after herparents had had ample opportunity to condition her to support their scam andattempted financial defrauding of the government.C.It is also preposterous to credit a child at age 4 with an accurate“identification” recalled from age 2-1/2 (her age at the CID-invented-backdate).10.Page 8: “… and of the Aquinos’ apartment building as the location of the allegedcrime …” Page 13: “Kinsey said that the area was familiar and that she had beenthere before. When asked if this was ‘Mr. Gary’s’ house, she answered yes, andstated that Mr. Gary had driven her there, where she met ‘Mikey’ and ‘Shamby’.”A.Almond made no such “identification” and not one of these allegedstatements - as is verified in the CID report of the staged “identificationtrip”. This is therefore a direct lie by Lisowski. The supposed “123identification trip” is exposed in detail in Chaplain Adams-Thompson’sViolations of #133 UCMJ, Section #D, items #60-72.- 681 -11.Page 8: “… and on other evidence from Aquino’s apartment partially matching thechild’s descriptions of the locale of the crime.” Page 13: The photographs wereshown to Kinsey. Although her reactions to the photographs are not conclusive,the photographs do show a number of items that corroborate K’s and otherchildren’s descriptions of the house where they were taken.A.What “crime”? All the evidence reveals that there never was any crime.B.In switching the location of the alleged crime from our flat to CommanderButch’s flat, the Army acknowledges that Marshall’s alibi is indeed“persuasive” as regards our flat. Therefore any objects in our flat areacknowledged as irrelevant. Or does the CID propose to shift furnishings andpersonal articles at will, just as it shifts locations and dates at will?C.As detailed on page #5 of my summary of Lisowski’s false statements to thedistrict court, nothing in our flat matched anything Almond alleged, orwhich was specified in the SFPD search warrant as relevant. What is this“partial match/corroborate” business? Is this a new way of blessing Harvey’screative efforts to transform a “bathtub with lion’s feet” into anythingwhatever with any part of a lion on it?D.Concerning “the house” [to which Almond was alleged to have been taken]:•On 4/7/87 Hickey asked Almond twice if she ever went anywhere withHambright. Both times Almond said no. When Hickey still persisted,Almond then said yes - to Sassy and Todo’s house.•On 4/7/87 Almond said that Sassy & Todo’s house “was upstairs and therewere no stairs around”.•On 4/7/87 Hickey asked Almond if the house “had a garage, a tree house,and a swing set, and a fence”, and Almond said, “Yes.” [Our home in SanFrancisco has none of these.]•In Hickey’s notes concerning other Presidio children, accounts concerning“trips to a house”, its description, and people connected with it varymarkedly. For example, in the 5/31/87 Hickey entry concerning JaimeParker: “[Jaime’s mother said] Jaime visited Trinity, and Trinity lives in thegeneral area of Katie and may be confusing stories. Then said Katie hadapproached her and said she used to take kids to her house to go tothe bathroom when they would go to Sanchez Park.”- 682 -•There is no record of any FBI/SFPD/CID investigation of “Katie” or searchwarrant ever served on her house to investigate its design, decor, bathtub,etc.12.Page 8: “… the Army’s factual bases were not so wholly unreliable as to renderthetitling & amendment-refusal decisions arbitrary or capricious.” Page 40:“Despiteplaintiff’s contentions, this investigation was not a ‘witchhunt’ … The Army hasbeen aware of plaintiff’s religious beliefs throughout his Army career and hasnotinterfered with his religious practices. The sole reasons for the investigationandthe CID decision to title plaintiff are the facts demonstrating that plaintiffsexually abused young children.”A.As is clear from the disclosure of the Hickey notes, all exposed anddocumented behavior of the Adams-Thompsons prior to the opening of theCID investigation, and the medical findings showing Almond to be a virginwith no medical signs whatever of molestation, there were no factual baseswhatever for the titling, making it indeed arbitrary and capricious. The entireconduct of the investigation consisted of an attempt to conceal orignore all evidence substantiating our innocence, and tomanufacture “evidence” to support the fraudulent titling. There wereand are no facts “demonstrating that plaintiff sexually abused youngchildren”. See (a) Adams-Thompson’s Violations of #133 UCMJ, (b) ROI coverletter analysis, and (c) ROI Summary of Significant Information analysis.B.As Lisowski is certainly aware, there were indeed previous attempts by Armyofficials to discriminate against me because of religious bias. This hasextended from a general officer attempt to deny me an ROTC teaching post(an act of discrimination immediately corrected by his superior, the TRADOCCG) to innumerable “command performance” attendance requirements atmilitary functions opened and closed by Christian religious invocations whichI was expected to endorse by standing in an attitude of prayer. I challengedand eventually corrected the more serious incidents and endeavored to ignorethe minor ones for the sake of professional courtesy. That does not mean that Idid not find them intrusive and offensive to my religion.C.The Adams-Thompson affair was national news. Obviously my “unacceptable”religion now indeed made me the target of a witch-hunt to appease JesseHelms and allies of his possessing sufficient influence to orchestrate andmanipulate TJAG/CID investigations. The alternative would have been notonly the exonerating of a Satanist senior-grade officer, but the prosecution ofaChristian chaplain for crimes committed against him and subsequently theexposure of the Presidio “Satanic child abuse” scam altogether, as just onemore in the series of such predatory scams throughout the 1980s.- 683 -D.The entire “Satanic child abuse” myth started by the now-discredited bookMichelle Remembers has long since been exploded nationwide by suchdefinitive studies as Lanning’s FBI Academy analysis and Robert Hicks’ InPursuit of Satan: Police and the Occult. This shameful witchhunt against Mrs.Aquino and myself, and the equally dishonorable efforts of TJAG to try to propit up long after it has been exposed for the sham that it is, constitute thesoleremaining memorial to this shabby episode of hate-crime.13.Page 9: “The report recommended, ‘Do not issue top-down guidance to Aquino’scommand or the continuation board …’”A.This quotes from the information paper presented by Lt.Col. John Burton to asecret DA meeting on 11/23/88 timed to coincide precisely with the opening ofthe CID investigation directed against me. It is not a “report” of any decisionstaken at that meeting.B.As shown above, illegal information was in fact fed to the AGR continuationboard by TJAG’s ARPERCEN representative, with the result that I was illegallydenied AGR continuation in violation of AR 135-18.C.The recommendation of “no top down guidance” in the paper was made onlywith respect to ARPERCEN, the headquarters where I was assigned.ARPERCEN had no UCMJ authority over me. That authority was held by theCommanding General of Fort Leonard Wood, who as evidenced by the TJAGchronology played only a bystander role in the investigation. Even the flaggingdecision was made by LTC Schwender at the Presidio of San Francisco,location of Sixth Region CID headquarters, with a Major Cork from FLWflying out to the Presidio to “concur”.14.Page 9: “‘… allow CID to continue its inquiry …’”A.A further quote from the TJAG paper: It is interesting that it refers to acontinuation of CID investigation on the same date that that investigationwas supposedly opened. Why are all pre-“opening” CID documents excludedfrom the ROI?15.Page 9: “‘… allow the local command to determine whether charges should bepreferred and an Article 32 investigation conducted.’”A.A further quote from the TJAG paper. My attorney Mr. Gary Myers wasinformed by Headquarters, Department of the Army that the decision not tocourt-martial me was made prior to the titling decision (i.e. prior toAugust 1989). In that case the account of the “decision by the Fort Leonard- 684 -Wood commander on 1/4/90” is false, intended as a cover-up of the illegalconduct of the investigation process.B.On 10/2/89 the flag was removed from my personnel file at ARPERCEN. Sucha flag would have remained in place unless a decision had already beenmade that there would be no charges preferred against me.16.Page 9: “More significantly, the Region Judge Advocate at the Presidio developedthe plan for continuing the investigation of the Aquinos prior to 10/17/88 (sic)when the letter from Helms’ aide was written.”A.This again refers to the 10/17/88 letter by Major Harvey suggesting ways tomanipulate a lineup and court-martial in order to obtain a conviction, andproposing illegal use of Inspector General subpœnas. It is not a “CIDinvestigation plan” as represented by Lisowski. No such pre-11/23/88“investigation plan, or any other CID/TJAG/DA documents concerning thisinvestigation whatever dated prior to 11/23/88 were included in the ROI orprovided in discovery upon this lawsuit.B.The letter from Jesse Helms’ office was dated 10/26/88. The CID investigationwas opened 11/23/88 - almost a month later.17.Page 9: “Moreover the CID reached its decision ‘to initiate this report ofinvestigation’ on November 21, 1988, before the meeting at which the high-levelofficers of the Army decided how to respond to the pressure from Senator Helms’aide.”A.The Secretary of the Army was in possession of the first letter from Helms’office almost a month before the 11/23/88 (not 11/21/88) meeting. There is noindication whatever that a decision concerning a response to that letter wasmade at that meeting, or that the letter was even discussed at the meeting.B.In fact the two letters from Helms and his assistant were consideredsufficiently important that on 1/17/89 Major General Overholt, theDepartment of the Army Judge Advocate General, was summoned to Secretaryof the Army Marsh’s office to discuss it personally. It was subsequentlyconsidered sufficiently important so that General Overholt met personallywith Senator Helms to discuss it.- 685 -Appendix 72: Court of Appeals DecisionPublishedUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALSFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUITMichael A.

Dennis Edward Szybala, AssistantUnitedStates Attorney, Alexandria, Virginia, for Appellee.- 686 -OpinionNiemeyer, Circuit Judge:Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino, formerly of the U.S. Army Reserves, 441 filedsuitunder the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (1988), against the Secretary ofthe Armyseeking to amend an Army report of a criminal investigation about him and torecoverdamages caused by inaccuracies in the report. He also sued under theAdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq. (1988), to review the Secretary’s refusalto amendthe report. The district court entered summary judgment for the Secretary,concludingthat criminal investigatory files are exempt from the provisions of the PrivacyAct thatwere invoked by Aquino, and that the Secretary’s decision not to amend was notarbitrary or capricious. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.IIn November 1986 the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), the Federal Bureauof Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division Command(CID) began investigating charges that Gary Hambright had sexually molestedseveralof the children entrusted to his care as an employee at the Child DevelopmentCenteron the Army base known as the Presidio.On August 12, 1987 Army Captain Larry Adams-Thompson reported to theauthorities that his three-year-old daughter, who had attended the ChildDevelopmentCenter during the period of Hambright’s alleged crimes, had become visiblyfrightenedupon seeing LTC Aquino and his wife at the Army’s post exchange that day andcalledthem “Mikey” and “Shamby”. 442 In a subsequent interview by an FBI agent, thegirlimplicated “Mikey,” “Shamby” and “Mr. Gary” in the sexual molestation of her and441 This is the first of several factual errors in this Opinion, indicating thejudges’ carelessness inreviewing the actual facts of the case. Their decision appears to have beenbased on technicalities ofthe Army’s CID investigation exemption claims, with only cursory - and as notedinaccurate - mentionof the underlying facts in this instance. In this sentence: I was not “formerlyof the U.S. ArmyReserves (sic)”; I continued to be a USAR officer - just not on full-time activeduty. Far from being anincidental error, this misstatement by the Court is of critical importance, asit indicates that in makingtheir decision, the judges assumed that some sort of legitimate administrativecensure or sanctionhad been taken against me as a consequence of the CID investigation. [Theyrepeat this assumptionlater in their Opinion.]442 As previously detailed, the only source of this allegation were the twoadult A-Ts, who changed thedetails of their account several times over the years.- 687 -other children at “Mr. Gary’s house”. 443 The investigation of Hambright wasexpandedto include Aquino and his wife.Although the SFPD discontinued its investigation of the Aquinos in September1988for lack of sufficient evidence, 444 the CD continued445 and in August 1989issued a report of investigation designating both Aquinos in the “title block”of the report anddescribing the various child-abuse and related criminal offenses investigated.446 Thereport concluded that the investigation was closed because all further leadsinvolvedadults who refused to cooperate, 447 and the applicable three-year statute oflimitationshad expired in June 1989. 448443 In her 8/13/87 FBI interview, Kinsey mentioned the names “Mikey”, “Shamby”,and “Mr. Gary”,but made no mention of the “supposedly-the-day-before & traumatic PX incident”whatever. She didnot associate the names “Mikey” and “Shamby” with the Aquinos either by name orby description.Moreover in her original 1/26/87 FBI interview (2/3 year closer to the alleged9/1-10/31/86Hambright-supervision window), Kinsey stated that Hambright had not hurt her inany way, made nomention of being taken anywhere away from the day-care center, and made nomention of either“Mikey” or “Shamby” or anyone resembling them. These names were produced onlylater in theHickey “therapy” sessions, and in different and non-associated contexts.444 The SFPD closed its investigation a month previously, on 8/1/88.445 The CID did not open its investigation until 11/23/88, as evidenced not onlyby FOIA documentsbut by the official flagging of my personnel file, security clearancesuspension, etc. which were allrequired upon a formal CID criminal investigation. The CID took no interestwhatever in the A-Tallegations for the previous 1-1/3 years since A-T made them, as detailed inthis documentation. Herethe court is simply reciting the CID lie in order to evade the reality thatthere was no CID interest untilafter the Helms-Secretary of the Army contact.446 As detailed in my analysis of the CID ROI herein, it actually contained noevidence whatever thateither Lilith or I had committed any such crimes at all, and ignored all of thefacts evidencing the A-Ts’ fabrication of their allegations.447 No such “non-cooperative adults” were ever identified by the CID. The ROImentioned no suchadults at all. The CID was also aware that pertinent adults, such as all of theother teachers at the day-care center, had directly and absolutely denied that Hambright had either abusedchildren or takenany of them off the premises at any time.448 This statute of limitations applied only to the CID-creatively-revised6/10/86 “crime date”, back-dated only because the A-Ts’ original 9/1-10/31/86 accusation-window could notbe made to fit our3,000-miles-away location. Had the CID truly believed that we had committed suchserious crimes, ofcourse, it could easily have finalized its ROI before the statute deadline.Moreover my “making offalse statements” [in sworn testimony of our innocence and the ATs’ guilt] wasstill very muchwithin statute deadlines, so I could have been prosecuted for that - except thateveryone involvedknew I was telling the truth. This “statue of limitations expiration” was simplya dodge used by theCID to have an excuse for not initiating any prosecution based on the ROI.- 688 -Thereafter, on January 31, 1990, the Aquinos requested that the CID remove theirnames from the title block of the report. While the CID deleted Mrs. Aquino’snameentirely, on the ground that the identifications of her by the childreninterviewed wereinadequate, 449 it did not delete LTC Aquino’s name. The CID also removed fromthereport charges arising out of allegations that Aquino made against CPT Adams-Thompson. 450 All the child-abuse charges remained, because “[t]he evidence ofalibioffered by LTC Aquino [was] not persuasive”. 451Aquino filed suit in the district court under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. §552a(g), tocompel the Army to amend the investigatory report about him and for damagesresulting from his discharge from the service, 452 which he attributes to theinaccuraterecords about him. 453 [In 1990 a continuation board of the Army Reserverecommended discontinuing Aquino’s service in the Reserve, 454 and he wasprocessed449 “Identifications” (plural)? “Children” (plural)? There is not a single“identification” of Lilith byany child in the ROI . There is only the “PX identification” alleged only by theadult A-Ts.450 Incorrect. The several sworn statements and detailed evidence that I hadmade concerning A-T’sdeliberate falsification of his allegations and attempted defrauding of the U.S.government with falseclaims based on them were never investigated nor refuted by the CID, but insteadtreated as “falseswearing” by me. This “false swearing” was left in the ROI titling after theadministrative appeal,because to remove it would imply that my sworn statements were indeed true(which they were).451 Graham Marshall’s alibi of our 123 Acme residence was absolute andunequivocal, and the CIDcould not refute it. Their only way around it, on the spur of that moment, wasto “relocate” thealready-“backdated” “crime” to another apartment in the same building, whoseresident, US NavyCommander William Butch, denied any such “crime” as well, and whose apartment ofcourse fittednothing of the strenuously-attempted “interior description” that the CID hadtried for months tofabricate concerning our own flat. Accordingly this phrase “not persuasive” wasused only becausethere were no possibly factual grounds whatever for rejecting Marshall’s alibi.452 As noted above, not “discharge from the service” but discontinuation fromthe full-time AGRprogram.453 Not to “inaccurate records” per se, but to the fraudulent “CIDinvestigation” commenced againstus, and to Major Harvey’s explicit admission [in Time Tate’s book] that the CIDhad intentionallyused the AGR continuation board to “get rid” of me - a manipulation which tookplace at thebeginning of the CID’s supposedly-not-predetermined “investigation”.454 The AGR board recommended only that I not be offered another AGR contractafter my currentone expired in August 1990 - 1-1/4 years hence from the board date. There was nodisciplinary findingthat my current AGR tour should be curtailed, and after its conclusion I wassimply transferred backto the part-time Army Reserve as a Lt. Colonel in full standing.- 689 -out of the Army. ]455 He also sued under the Administrative Procedure Act toreview theaction of the Secretary of the Army in developing the investigatory report abouthimand in refusing to amend it.On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted the Army’smotion and denied Aquino’s, holding that the files sought to be amended byAquinowere exempt from the Privacy Act provisions under which Aquino sued. On itsreviewof the Army’s action under the Administrative Procedure Act, the court concludedthat“[t]here was sufficient evidence from which the Army decision maker coulddeterminethat probable cause existed to believe that [Aquino] committed the offenses” andthattherefore the Army’s decisions to create the report and not amend it were notarbitraryor capricious. 456This appeal followed, but Aquino has now abandoned his claim for damages. 457IIThe Privacy Act of 1974 was enacted to “protect the privacy of individualsidentifiedin information systems maintained by Federal agencies” by giving the individualsinformation about and access to records about them and permitting them “to haveacopy made of all or any portion thereof, and to correct or amend such records”.Pub. L.No. 93-579, § 2(a)(5), (b)(3), 88 Stat. 1896, 1896 (1974). The Act authorizescivilactions in federal court to compel compliance with the Act and, in the case of“intentional or willful” violations, to award damages. See 5 U.S.C. §552a(g)(1), (4).Aquino contends that evidence collected by the Army CID did not justify itscreatingan investigation report titled under his name, and that those involved with theinvestigation were motivated to remove him from the Army because he is thefounderof the Temple of Set, a satanist religion. 458 Because, he argues, the Army didnot haveprobable cause to link him with the crimes described in the report, the reportshould be455 Again the Court makes this critically-false statement. I remained an officerin full standing in theU.S. Army Reserve until I requested transfer to the Retired Reserve in 1994; andin 2006 I waspermanently retired from the Army as a Lt. Colonel, Army of the United States(Ret).456 As my attorney Gary Myers noted in his brief to this Appeals Court, thedistrict judge cited notone single example of such “sufficient evidence” or “probable cause to believe”.457 I had not abandoned that claim at the time of this appeal. Indeed the appealwas in part toenforce it.458 Strictly speaking, the Temple of Set is not a “Satanist” religion, having nointerest in Judæo-Christian superstition or mythology. But the instigators of the “Satanic RitualAbuse” mania, the A-Ts,Jesse Helms, and the CID did not bother to draw such actual and factualdistinctions.- 690 -amended and his name deleted from its caption because the information is not“accurate, relevant, timely, or complete” as required by 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(2).The Secretary contends that Aquino cannot proceed under the Privacy Act becausethe records that Aquino seeks to amend are criminal investigation records whichareexempt from the Act under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2).The Privacy Act authorizes agencies to exempt from many of its provisions,including those applicable here, criminal investigative record systemsmaintained bythe agency or a “component” thereof. The record systems must be “maintained byanagency or component thereof which performs as its principal function anyactivitypertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws” and must consist of “informationcompiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation”. See 5 U.S.C. §552a(j)(2). Toimplement its election to exempt criminal investigative record systems, theagencymust promulgate rules to do so and give reasons why the systems are to beexempted.See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j).The Army has promulgated a rule, 32 C.F.R § 505.5(e)(r), to exempt the CID’ssystem of records known as the Criminal Investigation and Crime LaboratoryFiles,which includes reports of investigations. The rule applies to “[a]ll portions ofthissystem of records which fall within 5 U.S.C. § 552a(j)(2)”. The rule also setsforth thereasons for the exemption:[A]ccess might compromise on-going investigations, reveal classifiedinformation,investigatory techniques or the identity of confidential informants, or invadetheprivacy of persons who provide information in connection with a particularinvestigation. 459See 32 C.F.R § 505.5(e)(r)(4)(b).Aquino argues that the exemption may be given effect only if the Armypromulgatesrules which would require it to give, on a case by case approach, reasons forexemptingeach document or set of documents which it chooses to include within theexemption.In short, he argues that documents must be processed individually in a mannerspecified by rule such that each time an exemption is invoked, an authorizedreason forthe exemption must be given.In support of his argument he cites Doe v. FBI, 936 F.2d 1346, 1353 (D.C. Cir.1991).In that case the court was presented with the problem, not present here, ofproviding amethod by which the FBI could protect exempt records which were contained innon-exempt files. The FBI had an employment application file with respect to Doe,which459 As detailed in Gary Myers’ briefs, the CID ROI in this instance fulfillsnone of these tests.- 691 -contained criminal investigation records of Doe. The court stated, “The criticalquestion, then, is whether the FBI’s investigatory information on Doe lost itsexemptstatus when it was subsequently used, in altered form, for a non-law enforcementpurpose”, i.e. to process an employment application. 936 F.2d at 1356. The courtremanded the case to the district court to determine whether the cumulativeburden tothe FBI from processing amendment requests, one of the FBI’s reasons forexemption,applied to non-law enforcement records containing law enforcement information asaclass. Id. at 1358. We are not presented with any of those issues in this case.While we can understand that Aquino would want a more individualized evaluationof his file to justify the CID’s claim of exemption, particularly when hebelieves that aninvestigatory report is inaccurate, we do not think that the Privacy Act wasintended toprovide an amendatory procedure for records about investigations into violationsof thecriminal laws. The Army effectively promulgated rules to exempt criminalinvestigatoryfiles, and Aquino makes no contention that his records are not contained withinthe“system of records” exempted. Section 552a(j) provides that any agency maypromulgate rules “to exempt any system of records within the agency” fromspecifiedPrivacy Act provisions if the agency... include[s] in the statement required under §553c of this title [requiringnotice tointerested persons giving them an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking], thereasons why the system of records is to be exempted from a provision of thissection.(emphasis added). This the agency has done.Aquino does not suggest that the rule-making process was defective. Nor does hecontend that the reasons stated by the rule are not adequate. Aquino’s principalcomplaint centers on his contention that the investigation itself was improperlymotivated and that information reported was in some respects false, but he doesnotcontrovert the authenticity of the records or the fact that a criminalinvestigation wasconducted.In these circumstances, we cannot conclude that a statute aimed at protectingtheprivacy of records can be made the vehicle to challenge whether an underlyingcriminalinvestigation was properly motivated. It is sufficient for the Privacy Actexemption thatthe records are authentic and were generated in connection with the CID’sinvestigation into a possible violation of the criminal law based on informationsufficient to support at least “a colorable claim” that the subject committedtheviolation. Cf. Pratt v. Webster, 673 F.2d 408, 421 (D.C. Cir. 1982)(interpreting 5 U.S.C.§ 552(b)(7) (1976) to require that an agency “establish that its investigatingactivities- 692 -are realistically based on a legitimate concern that federal laws have been ormay beviolated”).460Because we conclude that the files in this case were generated for the purposeof alaw enforcement investigation by a component of the Army, the CID, whose primarypurpose it was to investigate violations and that such files were exempted byregulationpromulgated under § 552a(j) of the Privacy Act, the refusal by the CID to amendthosefiles cannot give rise to a civil action under § 552a(g)(l)(a).IIIAquino also sued under the Administrative Procedure Act to review theSecretary’sdecisions to title an investigatory report with his name and refuse to amend it.We are in some doubt about whether an action to compel the amendment ofdocuments under the Administrative Procedure Act is available when Congressprovides specifically for that type of suit under the Privacy Act. Cf. Block v.CommunityNutrition Inst. , 467 U.S. 340, 345-48 (1984) (rejecting AdministrativeProcedure Act(APA) review of milk marketing orders in suits by consumers because extensivenon-APA statutory scheme of review implicitly precludes them). We need not decidethisissue, however, because we agree with the district court that the decisions meettheapplicable standard under the Administrative Procedure Act.Although the decisions to investigate and subsequently to title a report of theinvestigation in Aquino’s name fall within the prosecutorial discretion of theCID, thedecision not to amend the title block constitutes informal adjudication. Wethereforeagree with the parties and the district court that the appropriate standard ofreviewunder the Administrative Procedure Act is whether the decision was “arbitrary,capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”.See 5U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (1988); Duke Power Co. v. United States Nuclear RegulatoryComm’n, 770 F.2d 386, 389 (4th Cir. 1985) ( per curiam). Under this standard“thecourt must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of therelevantfactors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment”. See HuttoStockyard,Inc. v. United States Dep’t of Agric. , 903 F.2d 299, 307 (4th Cir. 1990)(quotingCitizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971)).Under the applicable Army regulations, the CID names an individual as a suspectinthe title block of a report of investigation of a crime if there is “probablecause to title”,which exists when “considering the quality and quantity of all availableevidence,without regard to its admissibility in a court of law, the evidence pointstoward the460 And this Pratt test, as Gary Myers’ extensive and detailed briefs andarguments to the district andappeals courts verify, was certainly not met by the CID or its ROI in thisinstance.- 693 -commission of a crime by a particular person ... and would cause a reasonablyprudentperson to believe that the person ... committed the crime”. CID Reg. 195-1,CriminalInvestigation: CID Operations, Glossary-4 (November 1, 1986) (as amended April1,1989).Generally, to amend a report an individual must adduce “new, relevant, andmaterial facts that are determined to warrant revision”. Army Reg. 195-2,CriminalInvestigation Activities, & 4-4b (Oct. 30, 1985). More particularly, to removetheindividual’s name from the title block, the individual carries the “burden ofproof” that“probable cause [as defined by regulation] does not exist to believe that theindividualcommitted the offense for which titled as a subject”. Id.In its initial decision to include Aquino in the title block of the report ofinvestigation, the CID relied principally upon the testimony of CPTAdams-Thompson’sdaughter that “Mikey” had sexually molested her, on her identifications ofAquino as“Mikey”, and of the Aquinos’ apartment building as the location of the allegedcrime,and on other evidence from Aquino’s apartment partially matching the child’sdescriptions of the locale of the crime. 461 The Army denied Aquino’s request toamendthe report on the basis that Aquino’s “evidence of alibi”, the testimony of themenworking in the Aquinos’ apartment at the time of the alleged offenses, was notpersuasive. 462 The Army’s considerations in both decisions clearly wererelevant andtheir factual bases not so wholly unreliable as to render either decisionarbitrary orcapricious. 463Aquino contends that both decisions to title a report in his name and not toamendwere tainted by consideration of the irrelevant factor of his satanist religiousbeliefs.464He points to a letter dated October 26, 1988, from an aide to U.S. Senator JesseHelmsto the Secretary of the Army expressing distress that satanists, and Aquino inparticular, were members of the Army Reserves. In a follow-up letter, datedJanuary 9,461 All of these “reliances” were proven to be false, falsified, coerced fromKinsey by the “therapist”and interrogators, and/or contracted by known & numerous undisputed facts - asdetailed earlier andin detail throughout this documentation. All of this was explained in explicitdetail to the district andappeals courts by Gary Myers in his briefs and oral arguments.462 “Not persuasive” - discussed above: the CID’s fallback phrase for aconclusion based upon no factswhatever, and indeed refuted by the facts.463 A statement by this appeals court only possible after it has so repeatedly,extensively, andunquestioningly rubber-stamped the CID’s falsification of the facts andmanufacture of “evidence” inits ROI and now to these two federal courts.464 As previously noted, I was not a Satanist, but a Setian at the time of theA-T incident. The tworeligions are completely distinct from one another. Again the appeals court doesnot bother to showany awareness of this distinction.- 694 -1989, Senator Helms himself argued strongly for removing Aquino from the Army.Aquino also notes that on November 29, 1988 certain high-level officers withintheArmy met to discuss his case in response to letters from the Senator’s aide andothers.And finally the record contains an unattributed document suggesting that thecontinuation board deciding whether Aquino could continue serving in the ArmyReserves learned that his records had been “flagged”. [On appeal Aquino seeks to“supplement the record” with further evidence that, he argues, demonstratesanti-satanist bias on the part of an Army officer involved in the investigation ofhis case.Because we review appeals from summary judgment only upon the record availabletothe district court, see Fed. R. App. P. 10(a), we deny his request to supplementtherecord and refuse to consider the offered additional materials. ]465This evidence supports the finding, which we must accept on review of summaryjudgment, that some pressure was put on the top of the Army to remove Aquino. Itdoes not, however, require the inference that this pressure was communicateddownthe ranks to the CID, which conducted the investigation and created the reportofinvestigation, or was otherwise a factor in the investigation. Indeed the recordcontainsstrong evidence to the contrary. The report presented at the high-level meetingonNovember 29, to which Aquino alluded, recommended, “Do not issue ‘top down’guidance to [Aquino’s command or the continuation board] .... Allow CID tocontinueits inquiry; allow the local command to determine whether charges should bepreferredand an Article 32 investigation conducted. ”466More significantly, the Region Judge Advocate at the Presidio developed the planforcontinuing the investigation of the Aquinos prior to October 17, 1988, when theletter465 This refers to the statement by Major Mark Harvey in Tim Tate’s book(available only after thedistrict court action) in which Harvey admitted the CID’s illegal tampering withthe AGR continuationboard. While technically within its rights to ignore this development, theappeals court hardly bolstersits recited-denial of CID board tampering by suppressing this clear evidence tothe contrary.466 This statement naïvely ignores the fact that the CID’s “investigation” wasinitiated prior to thismeeting (on 11/23/88), and clearly not on the initiative of the CID’s SanFrancisco Field Office(which had shown no previous interest in the A-T allegations whatever). Moreoverthe CID’s principal“task officer” for this fraudulent investigation, Major Mark Harvey, not onlyacknowledged to TimTate that he had taken [unlawful] action to “get rid of me” by using the AGRcontinuation board atthe beginning of the CID “investigation” ; he also informed my Army attorneyCaptain Hayesthat I would be “titled” in advance of the nominal titling officer’s receipt,much less review of theROI; and he informed my civilian attorney Gary Myers that I would not becourt-martialed half ayear in advance of the nominal court-martial authority’s (the Major Generalcommanding FortLeonard Wood) announced decision. Under the circumstances only a complete fool,or someoneparticipating in this same predetermined agenda, would venture a statement suchas the court’s here.Note also that while this quote was taken from one of several information paperswhich werepresented at this secret Pentagon meeting, the official results andrecommendations of thatmeeting were never disclosed to me in my FOIA requests.- 695 -from Senator Helms’ aide was written. 467 Moreover, the CID reached its decision“toinitiate this [report of investigation]” on November 21, 1988, before themeeting atwhich the high-level officers of the Army decided how to respond to the pressurefromSenator Helms’ aide. 468 The evidence of political pressure advanced by Aquinodoes notsupport his conclusion that it precipitated the investigation about him. 469We cannot conclude from the record before us that the Army’s decision to titleaninvestigative report with Aquino’s name or its subsequent decision not to removehisname from the title block of the report were the result of other than relevantconsiderations. Since it is not the role of the courts to second-guess anagency’sdecision, absent a clear error of judgment, not present in this case, weconclude thatthe district court acted properly. 470The decision of the district court granting the Secretary’s motion for summaryjudgment and denying Aquino’s is accordinglyAFFIRMED.467 As previously documented herein and explained by Gary Myers to the districtand appeals courts,this so-called “CID investigation plan” was nothing more than a memorandum fromthen-CaptainMark Harvey suggesting ways in which the laws concerning court testimony andlineups could beevaded by the CID in any action which might be taken against me. There was noreference to any pre-existing, current, or imminent CID official investigation whatever.468 Helms’ first letter was sent 10/26/88 (not “10/17/88” as the court sayshere), which was well inadvance of the opening of the CID “investigation” on 11/23/88.469 The timing and force of the Helms-Marsh communiqués, not to mention Marsh’ssending of theJudge Advocate General of the U.S. Army to Capitol Hill to brief Helmspersonally in response to hisdemands, strike me as pretty prima facie evidence in this regard. Since neitherSecretary Marsh,Senator Helms, or General Overholt provided me with records of theirconversations and decisions atthis time in response to my FOIA requests, one must assume they didn’t want meto see any suchrecords. If they had all simply discussed the day’s weather in Washington, Idaresay my FOIA requestswould have been fulfilled as required by the law.470 After the glaring omissions, misstatements, and factual falsehoods throughthis Opinion, this“conclusion” borders on sheer slapstick.- 696 -Appendix 73: Gary Myers’ Petition for Rehearing en Banc[Note: This document, like Myers’ Appeal brief, contained extensivecase citations in footnotes. Only the basic text sections are reproducedhere.]In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth CircuitNo. 91-1164 (Judgment entered on appeal: February 26, 1992)Michael Aquino, Plaintiff-Petitioner,v.The Honorable Michael Stone, Secretary of the Army, Defendant-PetitioneeOn Petition for Rehearing from the United States Court of Appealsfor the Fourth CircuitPetition for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing en BancMarch 11, 1992PETITION FOR REHEARINGIntroductionIn counsel’s judgment, this Court’s decision affirming the district court’srejection ofplaintiff’s request for amendment of his records and damages under the PrivacyActand granting the Army’s motion for summary judgment, is an opinion in directconflictwith another decision of this Court and of other Courts of Appeals, and theconflict isnot addressed in the opinion.The Court’s opinion conflicts with its prior decision in Ryan v Department ofJustice and those other Circuits that have relied upon it as a landmark case toclarify orextend its rationale in construing exemptions under the Privacy Act.Even more striking in the present case, is that this Court cites no authority,legislative or otherwise, to support its decision. Instead the Court simplymakes a bare,conclusory remark that “we do not think that the Privacy Act was intended toprovidean amendatory procedure for records about investigations into violations of thecriminal laws”.- 697 -The legal consequences of this decision are twofold:• First, the law on this issue now internally conflicts within this Circuit, andwiththose that have interpreted Ryan.• Secondly, a whole new body of law has been created without legal or policyjustification that grants criminal law enforcement agencies virtual immunityunder the Privacy Act. What the Court proclaims instead is that in suchcircumstances, the only appropriate “vehicle to challenge whether anunderlying criminal investigation was properly motivated” is the minimal“arbitrary and capricious” standard under the Administrative Procedure Act.Finally, the Court has overlooked a key provision and entitlement in the PrivacyActby concluding, without any affirmative evidence to the contrary, that MichaelAquinono longer contemplates damages in his claim. I at 4.For the foregoing reasons counsel additionally submits a Suggestion forRehearingen Banc.ArgumentI. Ryan stands for the proposition that specific law enforcement records areexemptfrom the Privacy Act amendment provisions only if the agency’s reason forwithholding the specific records is “consistent with one of the reasons listedin the[agency’s exemption] regulation”.The holding of Ryan and its significance were fully set forth in Petitioner’sbrief andreply brief on appeal. In Ryan the court’s examination of the document’scontentsapparently proved that granting access “would compromise ongoing investigationsandreveal investigatory techniques”. Since this reason was actually listed as oneof theadverse effects listed in the Department of Justice’s exemption regulation, thecourtupheld the exemption.The landmark status of the Ryan decision has been affirmed by its application,interpretation, and extension in several other circuit court decisions involvingPrivacyAct exemptions. Using the same language, the Exner court upheld the lawenforcementexemption, agreeing with the lower court “because [it] found that the materialhere hadbeen withheld for reasons consistent with those set out in the implementingregulation”. Id. at 1202, 1206-07.In a concurring opinion that included a detailed analysis of case law,legislativehistory, and executive branch implementation, Judge Pregerson clarified andsupported the Exner holding by interpreting the Fourth Circuit’s recent Ryancase. Id.- 698 -at 1207-1209. Judge Pregerson interpreted Ryan to mean that “the reason forwithholding the document was consistent with at least one of the adverse effectslistedin the statement of reasons”. Id. at 1209. Although there was no expressauthorizationfor courts to view such documents in camera for purposes of the de novo review,Pregerson added that such a power of inspection was implied. Otherwise “for acourt touphold an asserted investigatory record exemption without inquiring into whethertheinformation in the document justifies the exemption would make judicial reviewmeaningless”.In Andrews the court extended the Ryan rationale to apply in the context of theroutine use exemption, citing the decision in support: “Any release of documentsinreliance on routine use, as defined in the regulations enacted under the PrivacyAct, ...must be for reasons consistent with the reasons stated in the rule”. Id. at1413-14 [emphasis added].In Nakash the court extended the Ryan rationale again, applying it to narrowlyreadthe exemption from civil liability, limiting it to only where the reasons applyunder thesituation. Applying Ryan in conjunction with another decision, the court heredeniedthe exemption because “none of the purposes the [agency] cited [as reasons] areremotely served by allowing the agency to escape civil liability for violationsof thedisclosure and accuracy requirements of the Act”. Id. at 1365 (citing with Ryan,Tijerina v Veterans Administration, 821 F.2d 789, 796 (D.C. Cir. 1987).The Ryan rationale of applying the reason in the exemption regulation has beencontinued in several other Circuits:• Castenda at 986 (7th Cir.) (“Bureau of Prisons exempted itself from 552abecause [access ... would jeopardize legitimate correctional interests [quotingentire regulation] ... these reason apply with equal force.”);• Nemetz at 104-05 (“general allegations are insufficient to support exemptionfrom access ...” Records are exempt only to the extent the statute andregulation apply to this case, so “evidence must be presented [ in camera] ...inaffidavits stating facts in support of their claim exemption ... [as] to thisinformation”.);• Hernandez at 409 (found the Army’s law enforcement records were exemptprimarily on grounds that the reasons in the regulation applied: theinvestigation was ongoing, and a related civil action was pending).Finally, one authority has interpreted Ryan to mean that an- 699 -“... agency is limited to those exceptions which it has filed and explained, andcannotclaim new ones during a lawsuit to serve [another] purpose, though reasonable,was notthe subject of a proper exemption process earlier.” - 2 Federal InformationDisclosure(O’Reilly’s) §21.07 at 21-27 (1990).In other words, only those reasons authorized in the exemption regulation can beinvoked to deny access of particular records.A. The Aquino decision conflicts with Ryan because it advances an argumentcompletely at odds with its plain language: that an agency may exempt lawenforcement records if the reasons for withholding the particular record areinconsistent with every one of the reasons listed in the agency’s regulation.In Aquino this Court concludes that when exempting law enforcement records froman access request, it is not necessary for an agency to give an “authorizedreason” tojustify the exemption. Aquino at 5. “Authorized” here naturally means thosereasonslisted in the agency’s exemption regulation. Thus it can be inferred thatreasons thatare inconsistent with this “authorized” list can indeed apply to justify denial,so thateven if none of the adverse effects listed in the regulation apply, the agencycan stilldeny access.The court implies that it is not even necessary to review individual requestsforaccess to law enforcement records to determine whether any of the authorizedreasonsfor exemption still exists or still applies. Rather it is only sufficient thatreasons forexempting the entire system were stated in the regulation when it was originallypromulgated. As a result, an agency may decide to withhold law enforcementrecords atits discretion, regardless whether the reason for such action is consistent orinconsistent with the reason in the regulation.This Aquino rationale, then, flies in the face of the Ryan “consistency rule”and allthe other similar interpretations given by the circuits above.The impact of the Aquino decision is alarming, considering that the Court citesnoauthority - legislative, policy, or otherwise - to support its argument. TheCourt onlymakes the conclusory remark that the Privacy Act was not intended to be an“amendatory procedure” to gain access to criminal investigative records. Id. at6. TheCourt directs instead that the APA is the appropriate vehicle, with its highlydeferential“arbitrary and capricious” review, to challenge whether an investigation wasproperlymotivated. Id.The result is a totally new body of law that renders meaningless the statutoryrightto de novo review under the Privacy Act for requests for access or amendment tolawenforcement agencies. Relegated to such a minimal standard of judicial reviewunder- 700 -the APA, it highly unlikely that unlawful or improper investigations or refusalstoamend would be exposed.The consequence is a virtual grant of immunity to law enforcement agencies,sincethey will be free to operate without the threat of the more rigorous de novoreview.The question arises, then: Upon what authority does the Aquino Court rely? Ryancertainly does not stand for the rule that reasons “inconsistent” with theregulation maybe relied upon to justify exemptions.The legal difficulty lies in that the Aquino decision is not clear whether ithasoverruled Ryan by silence or chosen to ignore it. The Circuit, however, cannotsimplyignore the uniformity of application and interpretation of Ryan by other courts,andthe judicial trend that has extended its rationale to include other exemptionsunder thePrivacy Act.The significance for this Circuit is that there is an internal conflict on thequestionwhether the law enforcement exemption under the Privacy Act applies to certainrecords when the reason for refusing access or amendment to those records isinconsistent with all the reasons stated in the regulation.The last legal issue the Court in Aquino overlooked is the claim for damages, assought in the original complaint at the district court. The Court here statesthat“Aquino has now abandoned his claim for damages”. Aquino at 4. The Court pointstono legal rationale or affirmative evidence from Michael Aquino on appeal why theoriginal claim for damages should not be considered. On the contrary, the claimfordamages comes from the statute itself, under the Privacy Act. Appellant neverrelinquished or in any way indicated abandonment of his statutory claim.Petitionerwas no less damaged by the Army’s failure to amend its inaccurate records whenheappealed to this Court than when he filed his complaint in the district court.For the foregoing reasons petitioner requests a Rehearing, and additionallysubmitsa Suggestion for Rehearing en Banc.Respectfully submitted,/s/ Gary Myers, Esq./s/ John A.

Aquino, USARJuly 1, 1992General Gordon R. Sullivan (Certified)Chief of Staff, United States ArmyHeadquarters, Department of the ArmyPentagon BuildingWashington, D.C. 20310-0200Dear Sir:I am writing to ask your personal intervention to correct a serious injusticeandviolation of Army Regulations and federal law committed against me by the JudgeAdvocate General and Criminal Investigation Command of the Army. I haveexhaustedall lower avenues of the chain of command prior to making this request of you.The facts are summarized as follows. Detailed documentation of any of thesepointscan be provided on request. I affirm that they are accurate under penalty ofperjury.In August 1987 an Army Christian chaplain, Captain Lawrence Adams-Thompson,made a knowingly-false and malicious accusation of child-molestation against mywifeand myself. I am High Priest of the Temple of Set, an ethical and law-abidingSatanicchurch incorporated in California. An additional motive in Adams-Thompson’seffortwas his attempt to defraud the U.S. government of $3 million in false damageclaims assubsequently filed by himself and his wife.The chaplain’s accusation was promptly investigated, amidst considerablenationalpublicity, by the San Francisco Police Department. That investigation was closedon8/1/88 with no charges filed. Because of the bias and violations of SFPDprocedure inthe investigation, I subsequently filed a complaint with the San FranciscoPoliceCommission, and that complaint was sustained.Following the close of the SFPD investigation, pressure was then put on the ArmybySenator Jesse Helms to destroy my reputation and career as a soldier. On11/23/88 -almost four months after the SFPD investigation was closed, and over a yearafter thechaplain’s allegations - the CID opened a new investigation.- 702 -Although it possessed from the outset conclusive evidence of our innocence andofthe chaplain’s deliberate false accusation, the CID nevertheless issued a ReportofInvestigation (ROI) titling Mrs. Aquino and myself for the accusation in August1989.The same ROI viciously misrepresented our church and religion and titled me forconduct unbecoming an officer accordingly. No court-martial charges werepreferredagainst me as a consequence of this ROI, however.While the CID investigation was in process, TJAG, in explicit violation of ArmyRegulations, influenced an AGR continuation board at the U.S. Army ReservePersonnel Center to discontinue me as a serving AGR officer. Also while theinvestigation was in process, the JAG officer controlling the investigation forthe 6thRegion CID secretly released confidential information from the investigation toatabloid reporter in an effort to further harm Mrs. Aquino and myself.Upon learning of the fraudulent titling actions contained in the ROI, I filed anadministrative request with the Commanding General CIC for their removal. On9/28/90 the CIC, as directed by TJAG, removed the chaplain-accusation titlingfrommy wife and the religion-titlings from both of us. I remained titled for thechaplain-accusation.I immediately filed suit in federal court to have this remaining fraudulenttitlingremoved. The briefs and oral arguments filed by the TJAG attorneys in thedistrictcourt contained extensive and deliberate lies in an effort to conceal themisconduct ofthe CIC investigation and to preserve the fraud of the titling. Based on thisdeception,the federal district judge declined to order removal of the titling.I appealed immediately to the Court of Appeals. Again the TJAG attorneysdeliberately lied to the court, and the court cited those lies as justificationfor its refusalto reverse the district court decision.I declined to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, since there seemed little pointindoing so as long as TJAG continued to lie to the courts and the judicial systemappeared incapable of or uninterested in exposing these lies.In February 1992 I filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Armyconcerning these repeated violations of law and Army regulations by TJAG/CIC.Afterrefusals by subordinate officers to act on the complaint, Acting DAIG MajorGeneralBean personally declined to do so via his 5/7/92 letter to me (enclosed). It ishisposition that TJAG is responsible for investigating itself.My attorneys and I requested TJAG to investigate and take corrective actionconcerning the remaining fraudulent titling, the lies in two federal courts byTJAGattorneys, and the illegal release of information by the TJAG attorney to thetabloid- 703 -journalist. In responding letters (enclosed), TJAG said that such internalinvestigationswould be conducted.On 5/18/92 I wrote to Major General Fugh, TJAG, to request confirmation thatthese investigations were in fact being conducted. Well over a month has nowpassedwith no response whatever to my letter (enclosed).These are the facts. It appears to me that, in a continuing effort to cover upits manyviolations of law and Army Regulations throughout this entire affair, TJAG hassimplydecided to bury the truth and take no further actions whatever. It is for thisreason thatI am now writing to you.An Army chaplain has committed serious crimes against a fellow officer andagainstthe United States Army and, as far as I know, remains a serving officer onactive duty.TJAG and CIC, in response to political pressure, fraudulently titled my wife andmyselffor a fictitious crime and then lied in court to cover up this fraud. TheInspectorGeneral of the Army adamantly refuses to investigate. TJAG, having deceived thecourts and having nothing to fear from a DAIG investigation, feels that it cannowsafely ignore the truth - and the law.No such crime as alleged by the chaplain was ever committed. I am an innocentofficer who has been grievously harmed by TJAG/CIC for political - and illegal -reasons. I earnestly request that you, as the senior officer of the Army andultimateguardian of its ethics, order the remaining fraudulent titling removed and thoseofficerswho have brought discredit and dishonor upon the Army by their actions in thiscaseheld accountable.Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

SullivanChief of Staff, United States ArmyHeadquarters, Department of the ArmyPentagon BuildingWashington, D.C. 20310-0200Dear Sir:In supplement to my 7/1/92 letter to you (copy enclosed) : I have just receivedtheenclosed 8/14/92 letter from Colonel Lane of TJAG’s Standards of Conduct Office.This is the same Colonel Lane who authored the 3/12/92 letter provided as anenclosure to my 7/1/92 letter to you.As previously noted, Major Mark Harvey of TJAG authored a deliberately false andfraudulent ROI, whose many falsehoods and unjustified titlings were subsequentlyexposed. During the course of the CID investigation this same Major Harveyprovidedconfidential CID information, and defamatory falsehoods, to a London tabloidjournalist who subsequently published them. If such actions by Major Harveyindeedconstitute “no violation of the Army Rules of Professional Conduct for Lawyers”,thenthose Rules are an impotent farce.Nevertheless what is actually happening here is quite clear: If TJAGacknowledgesMajor Harvey’s unethical and illegal actions, then all of TJAG’s efforts toprotect thefraudulent ROI, including the cover-up of the actual violations of Army law andregulations by Chaplain Adams-Thompson, and the extensive lying by TJAG attorneyMajor Lisowski to two federal courts, would be exposed. TJAG evidently thinksthiswould be far more inconvenient and unpleasant than merely continuing thecover-up toperpetuate a flagrant and vicious injustice to two innocent, decent, andhonorablepeople: my wife and myself.Accordingly it is not surprising to me that I was never advised of the name ofthe“Preliminary Screening Official” tasked to “determine the facts”, nor did anysuch“official” ever contact me to obtain further documentation and substantiation of- 705 -Harvey’s actions. Under the circumstances Colonel Lane’s 8/14/92 letter to me isludicrous.The questions, as posed in my 7/1/92 letter to you, therefore remain: Are you,asChief of Staff and senior officer of the United States Army, content to allowsuchdisgraceful, unethical, and unprofessional conduct by your Judge AdvocateGeneral’soffice? Are you satisfied to have such individuals as Major Mark Harvey, MajorPatrickLisowski, and Chaplain Lawrence Adams-Thompson wearing the uniforms ofcommissioned officers in the Army? Is the good name of an officer who has servedtheUnited States and its Army faithfully and honorably for 23 years of the leastconcern toyou?If you do not insist upon truthfulness, integrity, and justice in the Army, whowill?Respectfully,/s/ Michael A.

PARENTI, Appellantv.Kinsey MOBERG, AppelleeFrom the Probate Court No. 1, Bexar County, TexasTrial Court No. 2001-PC-3017BHonorable Polly Jackson Spencer, Judge PresidingOpinion by: Alma L. López, Chief JusticeSitting: Alma L. López, Chief JusticeSandee Bryan Marion, JusticeRebecca Simmons, JusticeDelivered and Filed: May 30, 2007AFFIRMED A jury found Peter J. Parenti liable for breaching his fiduciary dutytoKinsey Moberg and for knowingly aiding and abetting Moberg’s mother andstepfatherin breaching their fiduciary duty to Moberg. Parenti raises four issues onappeal,contending that: (1) Parenti had no fiduciary duty to Moberg; (2) Moberg was notentitled to mental anguish damages; (3) the award of attorney’s fees from anunderlying probate action as actual damages was improper; and (4) the exemplarydamages award is grossly excessive. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.BackgroundKinsey Moberg was sexually assaulted when she was a young child. Her mother andstepfather, Michele Adams-Thompson and Larry Adams-Thompson (collectively “theThompsons”), filed suit in California against the federal government on behalfofthemselves and Moberg regarding Moberg’s assault. The parties reached asettlement,which was approved by the California court. Consistent with the settlement, thecourtordered the federal government to pay $334,720 to the Thompsons “on their ownbehalf and on behalf of their minor child, [Moberg].” The Thompsons kept fiftypercentof the money and created a trust for Moberg with the remaining fifty percent.PeterParenti was hired to draft the trust, which was titled “The Kinsey Almond Adams-Thompson Living Trust” (“the Trust”). The Thompsons were named as trustees. TheTrust provided that Moberg would become a co-trustee when she turned eighteenbutthat she would not have exclusive control of the Trust until she was fifty yearsold. TheTrust also provided that if Moberg did not accept and sign the Trust within onemonthof turning eighteen, the Trust assets would go to the Thompsons unless Mobergwas- 707 -disabled or the Thompsons waived the requirement or extended the deadline forher tosign.When Moberg was thirteen years old, she moved in with her biological father.Later,as Moberg approached her eighteenth birthday, her father’s attorney sent aletter toParenti requesting that Parenti send a copy of the Trust to Moberg or herfather.Moberg had not seen a copy of the Trust since it was executed when she wastwelveyears old. Parenti responded in a letter that the trust documents prohibited thetrusteesfrom disclosing the trust documents except pursuant to a court order. He alsostated inthe letter that he advised Moberg’s mother as trustee that if she disclosed thedocuments to Moberg, she could be sued for damages. In addition, the letterstated thatParenti would provide a copy of the Trust to Moberg when she turned eighteen andbecame a co-trustee.Moberg turned eighteen on September 1, 2001. Seventeen days later, Parenti senther a letter stating that she should soon receive a copy of the Trust andexplaining herresponsibilities as a co-trustee and beneficiary of the Trust. Ten days afterthat, Mobergwas served with a lawsuit filed against her by her stepfather, who wasrepresented byParenti. The lawsuit was a declaratory-judgment action seeking a judicialdeclarationthat the Trust was valid and that the terms of the Trust should be followed,including aspecific request for enforcement of the provision stating that Moberg mustaccept andsign the Trust by a certain date or all assets of the Trust would be distributedto theThompsons. The deadline for her to sign the Trust was extended to November 1,2001.Moberg filed a counterclaim against the Thompsons for breach of their fiduciarydutiesand to declare the trust unenforceable.The probate court ultimately terminated the Trust and ordered all trust assetsdistributed to Moberg. Moberg then brought this suit against Parenti for breachoffiduciary duty and for aiding and abetting the Thompsons in breaching theirfiduciaryduty. After a jury trial, the jury found that an attorney-client relationshipexistedbetween Parenti and Moberg in the creation of the trust and that Parenti wasliable onboth of Moberg’s claims. The jury awarded Moberg $55,000 in damages for theattorney’s fees she incurred in the declaratory-judgment suit. The jury alsoawardedMoberg mental anguish damages in the amount of $5,000 and exemplary damages inthe amount of $300,000. Because Moberg had previously been awarded $13,500 oftheattorney’s fees she incurred in the declaratory-judgment action, the trial courtapplied acredit of $13,500 to the damages awarded by the jury. The trial court alsoreduced theexemplary damage award to $200,000. This appeal followed.Independent Ground to Support JudgmentOn appeal, Parenti challenges only one of two theories of liability submitted tothejury. The jury found Parenti liable under both theories. When a separate and- 708 -independent ground that supports the judgment is not challenged on appeal, theappellate court must affirm. See Nobility Homes of Tex., Inc. v. Shivers, 557S.W.2d 77,83 (Tex. 1977); San Antonio Press, Inc. v. Custom Bilt Mach., 852 S.W.2d 64, 65(Tex.App.-San Antonio 1993, no writ).Parenti does not raise a separate issue challenging the jury’s finding thatMobergwas Parenti’s client. Parenti’s challenge to that finding is subsumed in hisissuechallenging the jury’s finding that he failed to comply with his fiduciary dutytoMoberg, which was only one of the theories of liability submitted to the jury.Thesecond theory of liability - knowingly aiding and abetting Moberg’s parents inviolatingtheir fiduciary duty to Moberg - does not rest on the existence of anattorney-clientrelationship between Parenti and Moberg but only upon the existence of afiduciaryrelationship between Moberg and her parents. Therefore, based on the manner inwhich Parenti presented his issues and based on his failure to challenge thesecondtheory of liability, this court is unable to reach the issue of whether anattorney-clientrelationship legally existed between Parenti and Moberg. Accordingly, thisopinionshould not in any way be read as addressing that issue.Because Parenti fails to challenge the second theory of liability, which is aseparateand independent ground that supports the judgment, we affirm the trial court’sjudgment as to liability. Nobility Homes of Tex., Inc., 557 S.W.2d at 83; SanAntonioPress, Inc., 852 S.W.2d at 65. We now turn to Parenti’s remaining issuesregardingdamages.Mental Anguish DamagesIn his second issue, Parenti contends that the trial court erred in awardingMobergmental anguish damages because: (1) Moberg’s actual damages were economic; (2)theevidence in support of an award of mental anguish damages is legallyinsufficient; (3)there is no causal link between Parenti’s conduct and Moberg’s mental anguish.A. Recovery of Mental Anguish Damages When Actual Damages areEconomicParenti argues that Moberg cannot recover mental anguish damages because heractual damages are economic in nature. In support of his argument, Parenti citestwocases in which the Texas Supreme Court held that mental anguish damages are notrecoverable in cases involving certain negligence claims. See Douglas v. Delp,987 S.W.2d 879, 885 (Tex. 1999) (holding that plaintiff cannot recover damages formentalanguish when mental anguish is consequence of economic losses caused byattorney’snegligence); City of Tyler v. Likes, 962 S.W.2d 489, 497 (Tex. 1997) (mentalanguishbased solely on negligent property damage not compensable as matter of law).However, Moberg did not allege negligence in this case. Further, courts haveheld that- 709 -mental anguish damages are recoverable in some cases where the defendant’sconductis intentional or malicious. See Likes, 962 S.W.2d at 495 (stating that mentalanguishdamages are recoverable for some common law torts involving intentional ormaliciousconduct); Farmers & Merch. State Bank of Krum v. Ferguson, 617 S.W.2d 918, 921(Tex. 1981) (upholding award of mental anguish damages under section 4.402 oftheUCC for wrongful dishonor where jury found bank acted with malice); Beaumont v.Basham, 205 S.W.3d 608, 620 (Tex. App.-Waco 2006, pet. denied) (holding thatplaintiff could recover mental anguish damages under the Theft Liability Actwherejury found defendants acted with malice when they committed theft). Here, thejuryfound that Parenti acted with malice, and Parenti does not challenge thatfinding.Therefore, because the jury found that Parenti acted with malice, we hold thatthe trialcourt did not err in awarding mental anguish damages to Moberg. See Likes, 962S.W.2d at 495; Ferguson, 617 S.W.2d at 921; Basham, 205 S.W.3d at 620.B. Legal Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Mental Anguish DamagesParenti asserts that the evidence is legally insufficient to support a findingthatMoberg suffered mental anguish. To survive a legal sufficiency challenge, Mobergwasrequired to show by direct evidence “the nature, duration, and severity of [her]anguish, thus establishing a substantial disruption in [her] daily routine,” orshow byother evidence “a high degree of mental pain and distress that is more than mereworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger.” Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901S.W.2d 434, 444 (Tex. 1995). Moberg testified that she became physically sick whenshereceived the declaratory-judgment action brought by her stepfather and signed byParenti. She testified that she thought Parenti was her lawyer and that she wasshockedto see that he was representing her stepfather against her. She testified thatshe hadtrouble sleeping and that she had to miss work at times because she was cryingandvomiting to such an extent that she could not work. She stated:“I told my husband to call in because I couldn’t speak because I was crying toohardand I had been up all night and I just couldn’t stop throwing up. And it wasseveral daysjust like that. I didn’t go back right away. And it continued for a while,because thisstuff tends to follow you and kind of snowball as it gets going. So I can’trememberwhen it actually stopped, because I just, instead of - I guess I gained controlof myselfphysically at one point, and then it was just not being able to sleep and not,you know,wanting to eat a lot. And so I just - I - was able to put in my normal work dayand stilltry and get stuff done. I guess you could say I was coping. I was able to learnto copewith it.”We conclude that Moberg’s testimony that she cried, lost sleep, vomited, andmissedwork for “several days” is sufficient to support the jury’s finding. See Ortizv. Furr’sSupermarkets, 26 S.W.3d 646, 653 (Tex. App.-El Paso 2000, no pet.) (stating thatmental anguish damages are warranted where mental anguish causes plaintiff tohave- 710 -difficulty eating, sleeping, working, socially interacting, or carrying on anyotheractivity that, until time of alleged injury, she could accomplish on daily basiswithoutdifficulty). Because evidence exists in the record to support the jury’sfinding, wedecline to sit as a thirteenth juror and overturn the decision of the jury. SeeGainscoCounty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Martinez, 27 S.W.3d 97, 108 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2000,pet.dism’d by agr.). We therefore overrule Parenti’s legal sufficiency challenge.C. CausationParenti contends that Moberg did not provide evidence establishing that hermentalanguish was caused by Parenti. Moberg testified that her mental anguish was theresultof being served with the declaratory-judgment action. Parenti argues that Mobergdidnot differentiate between the mental anguish caused by the Thompsons’ lawsuitandthat caused by Parenti’s involvement in the lawsuit, and that it is more likelythat heranguish was the result of being sued by her own parents. Parenti cites two TexasSupreme Court cases in support of his argument. See Gunn Infiniti, Inc. v.O’Byrne,996 S.W.2d 854, 861 (Tex. 1999) (mental anguish damages not recoverable whereplaintiff’s testimony indicated his anguish was result of issues unrelated todefendant’sDTPA violations); Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812,817(Tex. 1997) (stating that consequential damages must be related tomisrepresentation).Both cases stand for the same proposition: that a plaintiff’s mental anguishmust relateto the defendant’s conduct. Here, Parenti’s argument fails because Moberg’stestimonydoes relate to Parenti’s conduct. The jury found Parenti liable for knowinglyaiding andabetting the Thompsons in the violation of their fiduciary duty to Moberg, andParentidoes not challenge that finding on appeal. Moberg’s testimony that her mentalanguishwas caused by a lawsuit that was filed by her stepfather and drafted and signedbyParenti directly relates to the jury finding that Parenti knowingly assisted theThompsons in violating their fiduciary duty to Moberg.D. Conclusion Regarding Mental Anguish DamagesWe emphasize once more that Parenti does not challenge the jury’s finding ofmalice. Applying the governing law, without the benefit of reviewing theunchallengedfinding, we hold that the trial court did not err in awarding Moberg mentalanguishdamages. See Likes, 962 S.W.2d at 495.Attorney’s Fees From Previous Case As Actual DamagesIn his third issue, Parenti contends that the trial court erred in awardingMobergattorney’s fees from a previous case as actual damages because: (1) the previousjudgment awarding attorney’s fees was res judicata; (2) Moberg is entitled toonly onesatisfaction of her attorney’s fees award; and (3) it is improper to awardattorney’s fees- 711 -that were incurred in a prior suit. Parenti also contends that the trial courterred inexcluding evidence of Moberg’s previous attorney’s fees award.A. Res JudicataRes judicata precludes relitigation of claims that have been finallyadjudicated, orthat arise out of the same subject matter and that could have been litigated inthe prioraction. Amstadt v. U.S. Brass Corp., 919 S.W.2d 644, 652 (Tex. 1996). Resjudicatarequires proof of the following elements: (1) a prior final judgment on themerits by acourt of competent jurisdiction; (2) identity of parties or those in privitywith them;and (3) a second action based on the same claims as were raised or could havebeenraised in the first action. Id. Here, res judicata does not apply becauseParenti does notestablish that he was a party or in privity with a party in thedeclaratory-judgment suit.Parenti was not a party in the declaratory-judgment suit because he was servingas anattorney representing a party in that suit. With respect to privity, people canbe inprivity in at least three ways: (1) they can control an action even if they arenot a partyto it; (2) their interest can be represented by a party; or (3) they can besuccessors ininterest, deriving their claim through a party. Id. at 653. Parenti has notcited, and wehave not located, any authority for the proposition that Parenti fits into anyof the threecategories. Because Parenti cannot show that he was a party or in privity with aparty inthe declaratory-judgment suit, res judicata does not apply.B. One-Satisfaction RuleParenti argues that the one-satisfaction rule bars Moberg’s recovery ofattorney’sfees from the declaratory-judgment suit as actual damages in this case becausethe trialcourt already awarded Moberg some of the same attorney’s fees she requested inthedeclaratory-judgment suit. The purpose of the one-satisfaction rule is toprevent aplaintiff from obtaining more than one recovery for the same injury. See StewartTitleGuar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex. 1991). Here, Moberg’s injury wasthat shewas required to incur attorney’s fees in defending against adeclaratory-judgmentaction brought by her stepfather.The record shows that in the declaratory-judgment suit, the trial court awardedsome of the attorney’s fees requested in that case. Parenti contends that thetrial court’saward in the declaratory-judgment suit constitutes full satisfaction forMoberg’s injury.However, the record does not provide us with sufficient information to determinethatthe trial court’s initial award of attorney’s fees in the declaratory-judgmentsuitconstitutes a full satisfaction of Moberg’s damages. The record is unclear as tothe trialcourt’s reasoning for awarding only some of the attorney’s fees requested byMoberg inthe declaratory-judgment action. In fact, at a pre-trial hearing in this case,the trialcourt indicated that it could not remember why it awarded only some of theattorney’sfees presented to it in the declaratory-judgment suit. The court stated that itwas- 712 -unsure if it had awarded only some of the fees because it felt that amount wasreasonable or whether it was because there was one party not before the court atthetime. The record also does not include the trial court’s final judgment in thedeclaratory-judgment suit. It is at least clear that Moberg’s total recovery ofattorney’sfees was no more than the amount she actually incurred in thedeclaratory-judgmentsuit because the trial court’s judgment in this case shows that the courtcredited theamount awarded in the declaratory-judgment suit to the award in this case.Withoutfurther information in the record about the trial court’s award of attorney’sfees in thedeclaratory-judgment suit, we cannot conclude that the award of damages in thiscaseviolates the one-satisfaction rule.C. Awarding Attorney’s Fees From First Suit as Damages in Second SuitGenerally, expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending a suit are notrecoverableas costs or damages unless recovery is expressly provided for by contract orstatutoryprovisions. Turner v. Turner, 385 S.W.2d 230, 233 (Tex. 1964). However,equitableprinciples may allow the recovery of attorney’s fees where a party was requiredtoprosecute or defend the previous suit as a consequence of a wrongful act of thedefendant. See Massey v. Columbus State Bank, 35 S.W.3d 697, 701 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet. denied); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holmes, 842S.W.2d 335, 341 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1992, writ denied); Baja Energy, Inc. v.Ball, 669S.W.2d 836, 838 (Tex. App.-Eastland 1984, no writ). Here, Moberg’s stepfatherfiled adeclaratory-judgment action against her seeking a judicial declaration that theTrustwas valid and enforcement of the trust provisions. Parenti drafted the Trust andservedas the stepfather’s attorney in the declaratory-judgment action. Moberg wasrequired todefend herself in the declaratory-judgment suit, in which the court ultimatelyconcluded that the Trust was unenforceable and should be terminated. In the casebefore us, Moberg alleged that Parenti aided and abetted her mother andstepfather inbreaching their fiduciary duties to Moberg by knowingly creating an invalidtrust andthen filing a declaratory-judgment action against Moberg seeking a declarationthat theTrust was valid. The jury found Parenti liable on this claim, and Parenti doesnotappeal that finding. Because of Parenti’s actions, Moberg was required to payattorney’sfees in defending the declaratory-judgment action. Therefore, we conclude thatbasedon equitable principles, the trial court did not err in awarding Moberg herattorney’sfees from the declaratory-judgment suit as actual damages in this case. SeeMassey, 35S.W.3d at 701; Baja Energy, 669 S.W.2d at 838.D. Exclusion of Evidence Showing Previous Attorney’s Fees AwardParenti contends that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of theattorney’sfees awarded to Moberg in the declaratory-judgment suit. We review the trialcourt’sdecision to exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. Tex. Dep’t of Transp.v. Able, 35S.W.3d 608, 617 (Tex. 2000); City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750,753- 713 -(Tex. 1995). An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court acts withoutregard toany guiding rules or principles. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 754. If error is foundin theexclusion of evidence, we examine the entire record to assess the harm caused bytheerror. See Cortez v. HCCI-San Antonio, Inc., 131 S.W.3d 113, 119 (Tex. App.-SanAntonio 2004), aff’d, 159 S.W.3d 87 (Tex. 2005). We reverse based on theerroneousexclusion of evidence only if the proponent of the evidence shows error that wascalculated to cause and probably did cause the rendition of an improperjudgment. Tex.R. App. P. 44.1(a)(1); Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 753; Vela v. Wagner & Brown,Ltd., 203S.W.3d 37, 52 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2006, no pet.). Accordingly, the proponentofthe evidence must demonstrate that the excluded evidence was both controlling onamaterial issue and not cumulative of other evidence. Able, 35 S.W.3d at 617;WilliamsDistrib. Co. v. Franklin, 898 S.W.2d 816, 817 (Tex. 1995). Erroneous evidentiaryrulings are usually not harmful unless the case as a whole turns on theparticularevidence in question. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 753-54; Sommers v. Concepcion, 20S.W.3d 27, 41 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied).We need not decide whether the exclusion of the evidence was improper becauseeven assuming the trial court erred, we conclude the error was harmless. In thejudgment in this case, the trial court credited the amount already awarded toMobergin the declaratory-judgment suit to the amount awarded to her by the jury inthis case.Because the amount previously awarded to Moberg was never made a part of thejudgment against Parenti in this case, Parenti cannot demonstrate that the caseturnedon the excluded evidence or that the exclusion of the evidence probably causedtherendition of an improper judgment. Accordingly, we hold that any error in theexclusion of the evidence was harmless.Parenti also argues that the court should have admitted affidavits of Moberg’sattorneys detailing attorney’s fees in the declaratory-judgment suit because theaffidavits were admissible based on inconsistent statements. However, Parentidoes notprovide citations to the record in support of his argument. Although Parenticites toMoberg’s testimony about the amount of attorney’s fees she had to pay in thefirstaction, he did not seek to admit the affidavits at that point in the record, andhe doesnot cite to a place in the record where he did seek to admit the affidavits. Asa result, hehas waived this argument. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h) (requiring brief tocontainappropriate citations to record); Flume v. State Bar of Tex., 974 S.W.2d 55, 62(Tex.App.-San Antonio 1998, no pet.) (failure to cite to relevant portions of recordwaivesappellate review).Exemplary DamagesIn his final issue, Parenti challenges the $200,000 exemplary damage award ontheground that it deprives him of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to theUnited States Constitution because it is grossly excessive. In determiningwhether an- 714 -exemplary damages award violates due process, we consider three guideposts: (1)thedegree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct; (2) the disparitybetweenactual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the exemplary damagesaward;and (3) the difference between the exemplary damages awarded by the jury and thecivil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. State Farm Mut. Auto.Ins.Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 418 (2003); Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa,212S.W.3d 299, 308 (Tex. 2006); Baribeau v. Gustafson, 107 S.W.3d 52, 63 (Tex.App.-SanAntonio 2003, pet. denied).A. Reprehensibility of Parenti’s MisconductThe reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct is the most important of theguideposts. State Farm, 538 U.S. at 419; Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 308.Indetermining the reprehensibility of Parenti’s conduct, we consider whether: (1)theharm caused was physical as opposed to economic; (2) the tortious conductevinced anindifference to or reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; (3) thetarget ofthe conduct had financial vulnerability; (4) the conduct involved repeatedactions orwas an isolated incident; and (5) the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit, or mere accident. State Farm, 538 U.S. at 419; Tony Gullo Motors, 212S.W.3d at 308. Here, the third and fifth factors are met. First, Moberg wasfinanciallyvulnerable at the time that Parenti filed the declaratory-judgment actionagainst her onbehalf of her stepfather. She had only recently graduated from high school,turnedeighteen, and moved into her own apartment when she was served with the lawsuit.Asa result of the action, she had to enter into a contingency-fee contract to hireanattorney. By the time the court ultimately terminated the Trust and ordered thetrustassets distributed to Moberg, she had incurred approximately $54,000 inattorney’sfees.Second, the jury found that the harm to Moberg was the result of malice, andParenti does not appeal that finding. The record shows that Parenti wasuntruthful in aletter to an attorney representing Moberg’s father in a custody dispute. Theattorneyhad requested that Parenti send a copy of the Trust to Moberg or her father. Inresponse, Parenti stated that the Trust prohibited the trustee from disclosingthe trustdocuments to anyone except pursuant to a court order. However, Parenti admittedonthe stand that his statement was not true. The Trust actually provided that thetrusteewas not required to disclose the trust documents to anyone who was not abeneficiary,did not have the approval of a beneficiary, or was not requesting the documentspursuant to a court order. Parenti stated that he made the false statementbecause theattorney was representing Moberg’s father in a child support and custody disputeagainst Moberg’s mother. When asked if he made the false statement to frustratetheattorney’s attempt to get information that he needed, Parenti answered, “[n]otnecessarily.” Parenti’s letter also includes the statement that he advisedMoberg’smother as trustee that if she were to violate the prohibition in the Trust, shecould be- 715 -sued for damages. However, since there is no such prohibition in the Trust, healso wasuntruthful with his client. Further, Parenti contradicted his letter when hetestified attrial that the reason he refused to disclose a copy of the Trust was because theThompsons refused to give him permission for the disclosure.The record also includes a letter from Parenti to the attorney representingMoberg’smother in the custody dispute. In the letter, Parenti states that Texas courtsarenotorious for upholding the terms of such a trust, that Moberg’s challenge tothe Trustwould likely be unsuccessful, that the trustees could defend the Trust withtrust assets,that Moberg “would be spending her education money on litigation which is a veryexpensive way to get an education,” and that Moberg “would end up paying allcourtcosts and all attorney’s fees on both sides of any litigation.” Moberg’s expert,ChrisHeinrichs, testified that it was incorrect for Parenti to state in the letterthat Moberg’schallenge would be unsuccessful. Heinrichs testified that a minor has the rightuponturning eighteen to void an agreement that she entered into or that was enteredinto onher behalf when she was a minor. Further, even though Parenti demonstrated intheletter that he knew that a lawsuit involving the validity of the Trust would beexpensivefor Moberg, he himself drafted a petition for a declaratory judgment against heronbehalf of her stepfather before she had even seen a copy of the Trust. Thepetitiondrafted by Parenti requested among other things that the court award attorney’sfeesand enforce the forfeiture provision in the Trust requiring Moberg to sign theTrust bya certain date or lose the trust assets to the Thompsons. Thus, if thedeclaratory-judgment action had been successful and Moberg had refused to sign a trust thatshefelt was objectionable, she would have lost the trust corpus and been requiredto payher attorney’s fees and Parenti’s fees. If she had signed the Trust, she wouldstill berequired to pay her attorney’s fees and Parenti’s fees.Heinrichs also testified that the Trust itself had improper provisions. Hetestifiedthat he had seen the property of a minor withheld until she turned eighteen,twenty-one, or twenty-five, but that he had never seen it withheld until she turnedfifty as itwas here. In addition, Heinrichs testified that it was improper for Parenti toput estate-planning provisions in the Trust because the law does not allow a minor to writea will.Heinrichs also stated that the provision stating that Moberg’s father couldnever be abeneficiary or heir under the Trust was not permitted by law.After considering Parenti’s conduct as a whole, we conclude that the evidence ofParenti’s wrong-doings supports the exemplary damages award.B. Disparity Between Actual or Potential Harm and Exemplary DamagesThe U.S. Supreme Court has declined to adopt a bright-line ratio between actualorpotential damages and exemplary damages, but it has stated that few awardsexceedinga single-digit ratio will satisfy due process. State Farm, 538 U.S. at 425. TheCourt has- 716 -also concluded that an exemplary damages award of more than four times theamountof compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutionalimpropriety. Id.Here, the jury awarded Moberg $55,000 in actual damages and $5,000 in mentalanguish damages, for a total of $60,000 in compensatory damages. Because the$200,000 exemplary damages award is less than four times the compensatorydamages award, the disparity between the two awards is within the SupremeCourt’saccepted ratio. Further, the potential harm to Moberg is much more substantial.If theThompsons would have enforced the forfeiture provision in the Trust, Mobergwouldhave lost the entire trust corpus, which was approximately $162,000 at the timeit wasdistributed. Thus, the ratio between the potential harm to Moberg and theexemplarydamages award is well within the accepted ratio.C. Difference Between Exemplary Damages and Civil Penalties in SimilarCasesSection 41.008(b) of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code caps exemplarydamages at the greater of: (1) noneconomic damages plus two times economicdamages, not to exceed $750,000; or (2) $200,000. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.CodeAnn. § 41.008(b) (Vernon Supp. 2007). Thus, the $200,000 exemplary damages awardin this case does not violate the statute’s limitations. Although Parenti pointsout thatthe Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) authorizes only three times the amountofactual damages as exemplary damages, he does not cite caselaw or provideexamples ofDTPA claims that are comparable to the claims in this case, nor does he provideanyother cases similar to this case that would support his argument. We thereforeconclude that the third guidepost supports the exemplary damages amount awardedinthis case. See Springs Window Fashions Div., Inc., v. Blind Maker, Inc., 184S.W.3d840, 891 (Tex. App.-Austin 2006, pet. granted, remanded by agr.) (holdingexemplarydamage award reasonable because within amount authorized by section 41.008(b));Citizens Nat’l Bank v. Allen Rae Inv., Inc., 142 S.W.3d 459, 486 (Tex. App.-FortWorth2004, no pet.) (fact that exemplary damage award was within amount authorized bysection 41.008(b) supported award).Because each of the three guideposts supports the exemplary damages award, wehold that the award does not violate Parenti’s due process rights.ConclusionWe affirm the trial court’s judgment.Alma L.
