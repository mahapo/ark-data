worship, and dedication are to the god Enki/Ea/Ptah, who (with the help of the goddess Ninhursag/Ninmah/Hathor) contributed to the creation of humans thousands of years ago, according to Sumerian records. We are their descendants. It was also Enki who gave us the gift of knowledge and wisdom; the potential to become as gods. We also keep close relationships with the gods and goddesses (the Anunnaki) associated to Enki. The y are our mentors, protectors, and friends. We show our devotion to them as well. Through our dedication to them, by meditation, supplements, and spiritual advancement, we work toward becoming as the gods. Some occult sources would like you to believe that entities outside of the self are merely a projection of consciousness, or super-consciousness. I ask you, do you think a ghost is part of your consciousness? Surely you’ve read about ghost encounters where more than one person speaks of the same ghost! Obviously this is not part of one person’s consciousness. The point is, and you will discover for yourself, the Annunaki are immortal flesh beings and are as real as you are. They move throug h the astr al plane simply out of convenience. We refer to our own plane of existance as the third dimension. The Anunnaki once inhabited our dimension. Though they had very long life spans, their physical bodies, like our own, were not immortal. The Anunn aki would grow old and eventually pass over to what we shall call the fourth dimension. This is where the Anunn aki gained their immortality. As humans were created in their image and likeness, we all have souls. Our souls too shall pass over into the fourth dimension. We will gain the very same ki nd of immortality at the end of our lives in the third dimension. Upon death, we will be guided up in to the higher dimensions of our gods and goddesses to live as eternal beings. Are you familiar with the terms astral projection or out of body experience? This occurs when your spirit leaves your body. During astral projection, your soul can leave your third dimensional body to explore the fourth dimension. In that dimension, your soul becomes a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"very solid physical body in a whole new reality. Your powers become limited only to the extent of your imagination. In sum, to be out of body is to be as the Anunn aki in their own dimension. You will find more information as you look deeper in to this book . We wish to supplement some of the really good information that is already available; however, we will make a few minor changes with logic and reason. We want to demonstr ate a clear-cut method that is easy to follow. Some items will be directly linked back to its source, and we will provide quite a bit of information in an orderly fashion. Finally, there are no grandiose titles such as High Priest, High Priestess, Magistar, Reverend, or any other mediating factors. While it may lend somewhat to the credibility of one’s experiences, it is our feeling that hierarchies can be disruptive and misleading in the processes of learning and guidance. There may be times when guest writers wish to contribute and they may have titles. Keep in mind that they operate independently."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ANUNNAKI The Anunnaki are a group of Sumerian deities. Anunna ki means \"those who came from heaven to Earth\". The Anunn aki were the gods of ancient Sumer, the earliest Mesopotamian civilization. The head of the Anunnaki council was the Great Anu, the sky god. His throne was inherited by Enlil, resulting in a dispute between Enlil and his brother Enki regarding who was the rightful leader. Enki w as an alchemist and was said to have created mankind. Some ancient astronaut theorists such as Zecharia Sitchin , Sherry Shriner , and Laurence Gardner claim that the Anunnaki were in fact extra-terrestrials who came to Earth in antiquit y and created or tampered with the genetic makeup of primitive mankind. They propose various readings of the word, two of which are \"anu-na-ki\" and \"an- unnak-ki\", both translated something like 'those who came from heaven to Earth '. (Compar e the Raëlian translation of Elohim .) According to Sitchin, these beings were identical to the Biblical Nephilim and lived on a planet called Nibiru , an alleged 12th planet of the solar system . He proposes that fallout from their nuclear weapons was the \"evil wind\" that destroyed Ur c. 2000 BCE , as recorded in the Lament for Ur. Other channeled material claim that they actually came from the Pleiades . Some of this theory is based on the idea that we have not found a \" missing link \", on the Sumerians' knowledge of the solar system, and on the Sumerians' crediting their knowledge and crafts directly to the gods (the concept of me )."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ENKI AKA: EA, PTAH, ADON, & THE LORD In Sumerian religion Enki was one of a triad together with his father Anu and his brother Enlil. In the myths Enki is said to have fixed national boundar ies, and to have given each god his or her role. According to another myth, En ki is the creator, the one who made humans. Enki was the god over fresh waters, hence the richness of the soil. But he was also the god of wisdom and invocations. In Babylonian religion, Ea (as Enki was called here) was the god of ritual purification, of sorcery and incantation. As the god who had given form to things, he was also the god of craftsmen and artists. Ea was a wise god, and officially he was the advisor to the king. Ea was also the father of Marduk, the nati onal god of Babylonia. Enki/Ea was the leader of the first-to-earth Nibiran pioneers. He was both leader and Science Officer. To Enki Anu had given the ME (holy decrees that governed such basic things as physics and comple x things such as social order and law). He created the living atmosphere of earth and introdu ced much of its wild-life through manipulation of Nibiran animals and plants, as well as those native to the planet they named Ki (En-Ki = Lord-Earth), which allowed the shipment of large numbers of Nibirans to join the work-force on earth in safety. He created all of the Mesopotamian City States to begin the mining and refining of the gold of earth. (Earth after all, was a planetismal; a chunk of a larger world, Tiamat, and had thus at one time had half its core exposed to raw space and then to water. Gold was all over the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"place. The impact of Nibiru's moon upo n Tiamat forced core-fluids through the cracking stone of Tiamat's surviving land mass and splashed core material all over the surface of the fragment that became earth.) The birth of Enlil; a child wrought from Anu and Anu's sister's daught er and thus genetically closer to Anu than Enki who was wrought of Anu and his wife, the Queen, caused Enki's Fall from grace. Enlil became the inheritor of Anu's throne. Enki was demoted to resource manager and sent to the Souther n hemisphere to oversee mining. It was Enki, who to spite his brother, warned the family of Zarusthud ra (eq. Noah) of the impending 'flood'. It was Enki who told the first of his female human creations that vaginal sex caused human reproduction - original sin - (mankind had literally been MAN-KIND for some 45 000 years before the making of the woman). Enlil had commandeered the first females Enki dev eloped and transferred them all to Mesopotamia. They were to be a controlled breeding stock, allowing specific combinat ions of sperm and ova for special purpos e people through artifical insemination. To aid in this process, the male breeders had never been dissabused of their homosexuality and continued to copulate anally with their female mates. Enki's explanation of human sexual reproduction removed the mystery of children; which up till then was considered as the work of Enlil magically, or natura lly like fruit on trees... same thing... God's work. Original sin was the learning that God can lie. Enki's explanation also ruined the entire stock for controlled breeding as well. It was Enlil who cast the first breeders into the wilderness, and I have no doubt it was Enki who insured that this group not only survived, but developed into the people who later bore daughte rs which the Sons of Gods took as mates. It is Enki/E a who equates directly to the serpent in the garden of eden. Yet, it was Enki who managed to save the basic genetic materials of humanity via the 'depository' which Noah managed to sail the flood in. It was obviously the dark ages which transformed Enki int o the modern \"master of lies\", and Yahweh (Enlil) into the Lov e-God."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"It was Enki who reconstituted humanity after the flood in the Egyptian Culture, to finish gold production after the planet settled back into order. It must have been Enki who altered human genetics and lowered life span by 90% as well, although it is very likely that this was suggested as part of the deal by Enlil or Anu. I suspect a retro-virus was used to destroy the human thymus gland immediately after birth in future humans. I suspect this organ was once a naturally developed organ which constitutes the basis of the physical regeneration and immunity systems which evolved in the Nibirans and was passed onto humanity either when the Sons of Gods bred with the Daughters of Man, or from the original breeding, explaining why they lived 1000 years and more before Noah's time. Enki was known to the ancient Egyptians as Ptah, Pteh, and Peteh. Ptah was the patron of creation, craftsmen, & artisans. He is regarded as a creator god. It was Ptah w ho built the boats for the souls of the dead to use in the afterlife. In the Book of the Dead we learn that he was a master architect, and responsible for building the framework of the universe. It was said that Ptah created the great metal plate that was the floor of heaven and the roof of the sky. He also constructed the supports that held it up. Some creation legends say that by speaking the names of all things, Ptah caused them to be. In the Memphite theology, Ptah is the primal creator, the first of all the gods, creator of the world and all that is in it. He is not created, but simply is. In some stor ies he is the personification of the primal matter, Ta-Tenen, which rose out of Nun, the fundamental seas. His wife is said to be Bast or Sekhmet who was known to the Sumerians as Damkina. She is the mother of Marduk who was known to the Egyptians as Amon Ra. Ptah was the chief god of the ancient city of Memphis. He was a creator god who brought all things to being by thinking of them with his mind and saying their names with his tongue. He was unique amongst Egyptian creation gods in that his methods were intellectual, rather than physical. According to the priests of Memphis, everything is the work of Ptah's heart and tongue: gods are born, towns are founded, and order is maintained . This it is said of Ptah: \"He who made all and created the gods\". And he is Ta-tenen, who gave birth to the gods, and from whom every thing came forth, foods, provisions, divine offerings, all good things. This it is"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"recognized and understood that he is the mightiest of the gods. Thus Ptah was satisfied after he had made all things and all divine words. He gave birth to the gods. He made the towns. He established the names. He placed the gods in their shrines. He settled their offerings. He established their shrines. He made their bodies according to their wishes. Thus the gods entered into their bodies. Of every wood, every stone, every clay, every thing that grows upon him in which they came to be. Thus were gathered to him all the gods and their 'Ka's, content, united with the lord of the Two Lands."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"NINMAH AKA: NINHURSAG & HATHOR Nin gishzidda and E nki f ace Nin mah. She holds Ad am u, th e hybrid Nib iran/Homo Erectus th ey m ade . \"My hands h ave made it !” victoriousl y she shout ed. Ninhursag, Lady of the Mountains, was a Sumerian goddess originally named Ni nmah, 'Exalted Lady,' a primeval goddess who once lived on Dilmun, the Sumerian Isle of Paradise. It was Ninma h who helped Enki create human mortals, shaping seven imperfe ct pairs of males and females. As mother goddess of the Earth, Ninhursag was ranked with Enlil and Enki in importan ce. Temples to her included the E.mah, 'Exalted House,' in Adab and another temple of the same name at Girsu. Ninmah is the half sister of Enki and Enlil. Ninhursag is one of the oldest members of the Sumerian pantheon and has prestigious titles such as 'mother of the gods' and 'mother of all children'. She was the tutelary deity of the Sumerian rulers, who styled themselves \"children of Ninhursag\". A temple of Ninhursag was excavated near Tell Harriri (the ancient Mari) in Syria, near the Iraquian border. Ninmah was known to the ancient Egyptians as Hathor, Het-Heru, Het- Hert and Hetheru. She is patron of the sky, the sun, the queen, music, dance and the arts. Hathor is a very ancient goddess, dating to predynastic times. Hathor can be seen as the mother-goddess of the whole world, similar to her mother in law Isis. Hathor's cult is unusual, as both men and women were her priests (most deities had clerics of the same gender as they). Many of them were artisans, musicians, and dancers who turned their talents into creating rituals that were nothing short of works of art. Music and dance were part of the worship of Hath or like no other deity in Egypt. Hathor herself was the incarnation of dance, and stories were told of how Hathor danced before Ra when he was in despair to cheer him up."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Inspiration was also Hathor's bailiwick, and many would come to the temples of Hathor to have their dreams explained or to beseech her for her aid in creation, much in the same way the Greeks invoked the Nine Muses. Hathor was the matron and embodiment o f what were considered the pleasures of life 5,000 years ago- and which for many, remain so even today: joy, love, romance, fecundity, dance, music, alcohol and perfume. A deity of women, she ruled anything having to do with the female gender. Yet although she was intrinsically connected to the female of the species, Hathor cannot be considered only a women's deity. She also had a large and devoted following among men. As Lady of Malachite, Lady of Turquoi se, Hathor was also connected to metal. Holding spiritual dominion over the Sinai Peninsula, she was responsible for the success and well being of the mines in that area. Apparently Hathor was as intensely worshipped by male miners and soldiers, as she was by women in childbirth or young girls desirous of husbands. Both genders were able to recognize the sacred divine within her seductively vibrant joyous beauty. Hathor is the embodiment of success. She has an absolute, laser-like focus. She may be joyous and benevolent or she may be single-mindedly vengeful towards spiritual transgressors, the enemies of her father Ra. Unhappiness, ugliness, failure: all these are foreign to her, not a part of her being. Even in her most vengeful, dangerous aspect, Hathor takes the form of an elegant if fearsome lioness or the searing but beautifu l solar eye. Beyond the traditional borders of Egypt and Nubia, Hathor was worshipped through out Semitic West Asia, beloved particularly in the city of Byblos. She was also adored as far afield as what is modern Ethiopia, Somalia and Libya. The seed of what would be universally beloved within Isis also existed within Hathor. Their appeal transcends national or ethnic boundar ies: Hathor perhaps embodies the wishes of those who long for life to be generously benevolent and abundant, while Isis embodies the hopes of those who wish for mercy and kindness. Hathor was associated with turquo ise, malachite and the metals gold and copper. Her demeanor glows with consistent confidence and sunny, good health. Hers is a warm, sensual beauty not aloof or remote. Although she ruled the perfumer's trade in general, Hathor was especially connected with the fragrance of myrrh, which was exceedingly precious to the ancient Egyptians and which on a spiritual"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"level embodied the finest qualities of the feminine. The protector and sponsor of dancers, Hathor was associated with percussive music, in particular the sistrum. Her traditional votive offering was two mirrors, the bette r with which to see both her beauty and your own. Hathor's image, specifically her head, was traditionally used to decorate sistrums and mirrors. Thus when gazing at one's own reflection in the mirror, you would see Hathor lookin g back, from underneath one's own face, serving as foundat ion and support, perhaps as role model and goal. This imagery was standard and ubiquit ous."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE REAL DEVIL Article by Laurence Gardner It has often been wondered why the biblical God of the Hebrews led the people through trials and tribulations, floods and disaster when, from time to time, he appe ars to have performed with a quite contrary and merciful personality. The answer is that, although now seemingly embraced as the One God by the Jewish and Christian faiths, there was originally a distinct difference between the figures of Jehovah and the Lord. They were, in fact, quite separate deities. The god referred to as Jehovah was traditionally a storm god - a god of wrath and vengeance - whereas the god referred to as the Lord, was a god of fertility and wisdom. The name given to the Lord in the early writings was Adon - the prevailing Semitic word for Lord. As for the apparent personal name of Jehovah, this was not used in the early days, and the Vulgate Bible explains that the God of Abraham was called El Shadda i, which relates to a Great One of the Mountain . The identity of Jehovah (Yahweh) came from the an original Hebrew stem (YHWH) which, according to Exodus, meant 'I am that I am'. Thi s was said to be a statement made by God, to Moses, on Mount Sinai hundreds of years after the time of Abraham. Jehovah was, therefore, not a name at all, and early texts refer simply to El Shadda i, with his opposing counterpart being the Adon. To the Canaanites, these gods were respectively called El Elyon and Baal. In modern Bibles, the definitions God and Lord are used and intermixed througho ut, as if they were one and the same cha racter - but originally they were not. One was a vengeful god (a people suppressor); the othe r was a social god (a people support er), and they each had wives, sons and daughters. The old writings tell us that, throughout the patriarchal era, the Israelites endeavoured to suppor t Adon the Lord - but at every turn El Shaddai (the storm god Jehovah) retaliated with floods, tempests, famines and destruction. Even at the very last (around 600 BC), the Bible explains that Jerusalem was overthrown at Jehovah's bidding . Tens of thousa nds of Israelites were taken into Babylonian captivity simply because one of their previous kings had erected altars in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"veneration of Baal the Adon. It was during the course of this captivity that the Israelites finally succumbed to the Jehovah god of wrath. They developed a new religion out of sheer fear of his retribution - and this was only 500 years before the time of Jesus. Subsequently, the Christians took Jehovah on board as well, calling him simply God, while the hitherto social concepts of the Adon were totally discarded. The two religions were henceforth both faiths of fear. This leaves us knowing that, within an overall pantheon of gods and goddesses (many of whom are actually named in the Bible), there were two predominant and opposing deities. In different cultures the pair have been called: El Elyon and Baal, El Shadda i and Adon, Ahriman and Mazda, Jehovah and Lord, God and Father - but these styles are all titular; they are not personal names. So who precisely were they? To find the answer we have to look no furthe r than where these gods were operative, and old Canaanite texts (discovered in Syria in the 1920s) tell us that their courts were in the Tigris-Euphrates valley in Mesopotamia. We can trace the related Sumerian records back to about 3700 BC, and they relate that the gods in question were brothers. In Sumer, the storm-god (who eventually became known as Jehovah) was called Enlil or Ilu-kur-gal (meaning Ruler of the Mountain) , and his brother (who became Adon the Lord) was called Enki, which means 'archetype'. The texts inform us that it was Enlil who brought the Flood; it was Enlil who destroyed Ur and Babylon, and it was Enlil who constantly opposed the education and enlightenment of humankind. Inde ed, Syrian texts tell us that it was Enlil who obliterated the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Dead Sea - not because they were dens of wickedness, but bec ause they were great centres of wisdom and learning. It was the Lord Enki, on the other hand, who (despite the wrath of his brother) granted the Sumerians access to the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life. It was Enki who set up the escape strategy during the Flood, and it was Enki who passed over the time honoured Tablets of Destiny - the tablets of scientific law which became the bedrock of the early mystery schools in Egypt."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"GODS AN D GODDESSES © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients This section of the book includes names and descriptions of many different gods and goddesses who are in alliance with Enki and Ninmah.

A future book may be released involving more names and descriptions of these deities and their alliance in greater detail. For now more extensive research is going in to the deities in alliance to Enki and the oppo sing alliances of Enlil. You may visit our website at www.templeoftheancients.com for further information.

Shamash was a powerful god and was revered by Sumerians as the god of justice since he traveled across the face of the Earth during the day and saw everything that happen ed. He was the tutelary god of Larsa, where he had a temple named the E.babb ar, 'The Shinin g House.' He was also the god of Sippa r in Akkad where he had another temple, also named the E.babba r. SHARA: Shara, one of Inanna' s two sons, was the tutelary deity of Umma where he lived in his E.mah Temple, 'Exalted House,' which was sometimes called, E.bursasa, 'House of Beautiful Jars.' Shara also had a temple in Babil, also named the E.bursasa. Little else is known of him. THOTH : aka Tehuti, Ningishzidda, Quetzalcoatl (Central America). Thoth is a very high ranking and important God. He is a son of Enki. His wife is Seshat. Thoth was the wisest of the Egyptian gods. The name Thoth means 'Truth' and 'Time'. Thoth was the Master architect who created the bluep rint of our reality based on the mathematics of sacred geometry."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE ENEMY © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients Reptilians : We don’t often see reptilians come around like the others do. There are many different species and they come from various places. We have been told us of a race that lives deep in the Earth, due to better living conditions for the ancient dinosaurs. They come to the surface at times, and they are mainly curious. Grays : These creatures are also referred to as The Holy (Heavenly) Host. They do the most interplanetary travel and are responsible for U.F.O. sightings. Angels : There are thousands of angelic beings and they all have the same ag enda--that is to cause the destruction of humanity. It’s a slow, miserable kill too. Statistically, over 10 million people in the U.S. alone are being treated for some kind of mental disorder. Angels drain the life force. They leave their victims feeling depressed and suffering with anxiety. As Enkiites, we build ourselves up (through meditations and our relationship with Enki) to withstand the onslaught but for those who are without, they lead pitiful lives of fear and paranoia. White Cloaks : Many of the enemy entities dress in white gowns, robes, and cloaks. They are never to be trust ed. Not all of the enemies wear white gowns, but need less to say, you can identify many of our enemies by what they wear. Do not trust anybody who wears one of these. This law applies everywhere on the astral. The gods and goddesses of Enki will never wear a white cloak. a white gown is always a symbol of the enemy. Cherubim : The second of the nine accepted choirs of angels, placed second as well in the first triad of the angelic hieraechy (with the seraphim and thrones) devised by the sixth-century theologian Dionysius the Areopagite. The cherubim ar e some of the most powerful of all angels, standing below only the seraphim in direct closeness to Jehova. Over the centuries the cherub has developed at times a benign and approachable image, in large measure because of art. Nothing could be further from the truth. The ir entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, are completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels (chakr as). Each of them have four faces. One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a man, the third the face of a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. Qlippoth : If there is a ghost in your house, chances are it’s qlippoth. These beings tend to occasionally find their way out of the abyss (the hollow shells), and accumulate in places where there have been heavy negative forces, or no banishments performed over a long period of time. Most often they have a cold prickly aura about them. Any being that is not a light being is going to give you a cold sensation. You may associate this with goose bumps. The gods of light give off a radiant or electrical heat and bright aura. Qlippoth are the exact opposite. Spirits who have died without light will become a being of cold and darknes s. Many angels can also be associated as qlippoth. They may feed from your life energy in order to empower themselves. Many of them can be considered as psychic vampir es. Phanta sms : These are astral beings. Some belong there as part of the universal balance and are simply to be left alone. Others are created accidentally by the force of thought. While not all humans are magickally capable, emotions that are dwelled on tend to take on a life of their own. Phanta sms are extremely dangerous if antagonized on the astral. They usually don’t visit, but thinking and talking about seeing one will draw it down. If you've seen one before, and you think about it, that may cause it to manifest again. If you see something on the astral, do not attack it unless you are acting in self defense. See picture below.

You may encounter many enemy deities on your path. You must use your own best judgement and common sense when communicating with any god or goddess. Any deity in alliance to Enlil is not friend ly or honest with humans. Athiest Deity : Any deity that does not believe in itself. Ok, so I've inserted a little humor here. We've had an encounter with a being of the enemy alliance who referred to itself as \"an athiest deity\" in order to mask its own identity and intentions. This is where we came up with a definition. It was Anti-Enki so we know where it really came from. There is obviously no such thing as an athiest deity.

If you haven’t dedicated and you’re considering this, I recommend that you study, start the daily meditations, and look over the blasphemy rites section in the following chapter. There’s no need to rush into an eternal commitment. When I dedicated to Father Enki, it was clearly a leap off the proverbial cliff with no ropes holdin g me back. I had no ties to any specific religious order. I had lived a previous life of misery and obstacles. I spent years in therapy and on medication for depression. And while I was able to make improvements with my condition, I generally felt empty inside. Still, nothing seemed to ever go right. If there was some kind of “god,” I was the ass end of his joke. After the rite was complete, I felt an incredible surge of power. It would only be in the days to follow that I’d realize the transformation that took place. My depressive moods had disappeared. I feel good. Life is good. Did I dedicate because I had problems? Absolutely NOT. I accidentally came across a link to a Pagan site and read everything I could. I already had a long backgr ound in magick and as I read this site, began to feel a presence. This stayed with me for the duration of my studies and I can tell you that Father Enki is a gentle God. His spirit moved me. I asked him for help and he gave it. That was the first time I ever felt a God and he heard me and helped me. Then I read “The 12th Planet .” It was this book that put everything into perspective and offered real evidence of Gods who were fighting for humanity. I was ready. I jumped!

The Purpose of Blasphemy: Are we all about anti-Christian blasphemy ? No. Rebellion against Christianity is not the sole or main focus of most Pagans -- at least not for the majority of us. For most of us, the central aim is self- development of various kinds \"to become as gods\". There are many Pagans for whom blasphemy -- and not just anti- Christian blasphemy -- serves some w orthwhile short-term goals, primarily as part of self-initiation. Likewise other kinds of ritualized taboo-breaking. Some may ask: Why bother to blaspheme a \"god\" that you don't believe in? If you're an ex-Christian, the idea of deliberately blaspheming the Christian god may seem downright silly to you ... yet still, at the same time, vaguely scary somehow. The point is to face those vague fears head-on. By facing subconscious fears, you can overcome irrational inhibitions. Ritualized taboo-breaking can help you learn to think more independently on a deep level, not just an intellectual level. And it can open a gateway to your subconscious mind, ther eby helping you to become more creative and opening a door to psychic and spiritual development. The idea of ritualized taboo-breaking as a part of occult initiation is not unique to Paganism. Some Tantrik Hindu sects have an initiation rite called the \"Ritual of the 5 M's\" involving the deliberate breaking of orthodox Hindu taboos. What kinds of taboos should you break? Depends on your upbrin ging. If you were brought up Christian, then a rite of anti-Christian blasphemy is appropriate. If you were brought up, say, by Communists, then perhaps some ritualized politically incorrect talk might be better."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"If you were brought up by neo-Nazis, play some music by nonreligious ethnic Jews, and perhaps write and recite some poems in praise of some ethnically Jewish scientists, artists, etc. whom you personally admire. If you were brought up by vegetarians, treat yourself to a filet mignon. (Eating meat is one of the \"5 M's\" of the Tantrik ritual.) Whatever you do, it should be somethin g that you are comfortable with on an intellectual level, yet still find deeply frightening or otherwise disturbing on an emo tional level. If you're an ex-Christian, especially if you had an oppressively strict religious upbringing, I recommend a solemn, formal ritual renunc iation of all three persons of the Christian Trinity. Another traditional rite of blasphemy is saying the Lord's Prayer backwards. Another is the infamous Black Mass. Another ritual, similar in purpose to rites of blasphemy, is Lord Egan's variant of the idea of a pact with the Devil. Here, too, the main point is to confront one's fears head-on. Some Pagans from non-christian backgrounds use the Christian god to symbolize a generic \"herd mentality\" (because we live in a majority- Christian culture) or to symbolize various popular secular ethical, social, or political ideas that the Enkiist may object to for whatever reason. I personally do not recommend this. If the Christian god was never a part of your life to begin with, then there is no need to bring him into your life in an antagonistic way. Instead, use more direct symbols of some of the things you were taught to regard as unquestionable sacred cows. (By the way, it's not true that today's prevailing secular humanist ethic is just a residue of Christianity. There are many other factors that have played a role in shaping modern Western culture besides Christianity.) I do not advocate breaking ALL taboos. I do advocate questioning all taboos. However, after questioning, one may conclude that at least some taboos (such as, for example, the taboos against rape and against molesting children) are in place for a good reason (even though at least some of the current hysteria about them might no t be justified). The only kinds of taboos I advocate actively breaking are those which now seem senseless to you on an intellectual level, but which nevertheless are deeply ingrained on an emotion al level. Make sure that you are intellectually prepared to reject whatever it is"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"you have decided to blaspheme. Do not do a rite of blasphemy on the spur of the moment without first examining intellectually, the thing you are rejecting. Be fair and honest with yourself. Carefully examine the arguments both for and against the thing you are rejecting, so that you can make an informed decision. The purpose of the blasphemy rite is to help you banish any remaining purely irrational fears, after you have made an informed decision on a rational level. I recommend that rites of blasphemy be performed in the privacy of your own home, or some pla ce where Christians and other mainstream folks won't see you or any evidence of what you're doing. Vandalizing churches is not cool. If you vandalize a church, not only are you asking for legal trouble (most church vandals do get caught), but you also risk making trouble for Enkiists in general, not just yourself. Let's not spark anothe r \"Pagan crime\" panic, please. Furthermore, vandalizing churches does nothing to weaken Christianity. On the contrary, it strengthens a congregation's sense of community as they band together to repair the damage. Remember, Christianity thrives on \"persecution.\" If you wish to oppose Christianity publicly as well as in a private ritual, then it would be far better for you to do so via counter-evangelism than via public desecration. To have the desi red effects, a rite of blasphemy should be deliberately scary and solemn. However, outside the context of the ritual, it's also important to be able to laugh about these matters and not take ourselves too seriously. To ex-Christians, I recommend the counter- evangelistic humor sites such as the Church of the Subgenius, which lampoons many different religions. As I said earlier, rites of blasphemy are not the main focu s of most forms of paganism. In other, more routine rituals, I recommend focusing on the gods of Enki, not their enemies. However, if you personally do feel a need or desire to perform rit es of blasphemy often, that's up to you to decide. Also, Pagans are not obliged to hate Christians (or people from whatever backgr ound you come from). The point of rites of blasphemy is to help you free yourself from the unwelcome lingering effects of religious (or other) indoctrination that was forced on you. If a person happen s to be genuinely happy being a Christian, then fine. But Christianity doesn't fit everyone's natural spiritual orientation, and"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"some peopl e do need to be set free from it. The Ultima te Rite of Blasphemy for ex-Christians: Purpos e and Preparation When I speak of the ritual on this page as the \"ultimate \" rite of blasphemy for ex-Christians, I mean \"ult imate\" in the sense of involving the one sin which the Christian Bible claims will damn you irrevocably, with no hope of forgiveness. It's far from \"ultimate\" in terms of sheer sensationalistic shock value, though. From a purely secular point of view, I must admit it's pretty tame compared to most metal lyrics these days. Yet, as far as I am aware, even the blackest of black metal lyrics have usually steered clear of what Christians traditionally consider to be the ultimate sin -- \"blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.\" (If you're a metal fan, ple ase correct me if I'm mistaken on this point.) So far, I've heard of only one song which specifically targets \"the Ghost\" -- the song \"Blasphemy\" by the Death Metal band Morbid Angel on their 1989 album Altars of Madne ss.) The rite below will center around a solemn, formal ritual renunciation of all three persons of the Christian Trinity. Or, if you were brought up in a non-Trinitarian Christian sect (you heretic!!! -- just kidding), you can renounce each of the three persons (or whatever you believed they were) without thinking of them as a trinity. Why is this such a big deal? According to the Christian Bible: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. (Matthe w 12:31-32) and: All the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin. (Mark 3:28-29) Does this seem utterly silly to you? Yet, at the same time, does it also creep you out? Good! Therein lies the potential for a deep inner transformation -- at least if you happen to be an ex-Christian. But, when you perform the rite, say your renunciation of the Trinity firmly -- do not waver!"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"One of the benefits of the renunciation rite is that, thereafter, you can overcome a lot of irrational inhibitions by telling your subconscious mind that you are going to hell anyway. Hence the ritual should be performed in such a way that, if Christian theology were true, you really would be damned irrevocably, with no hope of escape. To that end, your blasphemy against the Holy Spirit must be unquestionably deliberate and premedita ted. (According to most Christian commentators, spontaneous or hasty unkind words about the Holy Spirit don't count as the unforgivable blasphemy, nor do unkind thoughts, although some funda mental ists do live in mortal terror of committing this sin accidentally. Christian commentators have interpreted the \"sin against the Holy Spirit\" in a variety of different ways. Some define the sin so narrowly as to make it almost impossible to commit. Many would say that if you are still even capable of truly repenting of it, then you never really did commit it.) So, to make the ritual irrevocable, don't perform it on the spur of the moment. Put some thought into it. And I don't recommend it as the very first thing you do upon recognizing that you are drawn to Paganism. But you may indeed find it helpful at some point, if you're from a Christian background, especially if you're an ex-fundy. Important: I recommend perf orming this ritual only if you are sure, on an intellectual level, that you are doing the right thing, despite whatever qualms you may still have on an emotion al level. If, even on an intellectual level, you are still plagued by nagging worries that Christian theology might be true after all, please see the arguments against hardcore Christian beliefs on my Counter-Evangelism website. It would also be a good idea to participate in some inter-religion debate forums for a while, to make sure the Christians don't have any sufficiently good counter-arguments. (To give this a fair shake, look for a forum with intelligent, knowledgeable people on all sides.) If you are currently a disgruntled Christian, do not use the renunciation rite as your means of deconverting from Christianity. Deconvert by educating yourself, not by doing a ritual. Use the renunciation rite or another blasphemy rite only after you have left Christianity and have become fully comfortable with that decision on an intellectual level. If you do this ritual prematurely, it can be psychologically damaging rather than helpful. The purpose of the renunciation rite is to help you banish any remaining purely irrational fears, after you have fully addressed your"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"fears on a rational level by examining the arguments both for and against traditional Christian beliefs and making an informed decision against them. Some may say, \"This whole argument over whether Christian theology is true or not is irrelevant. I would rather suffer eternal torment than submit to a god like the Christian god. I will be loyal to Enki forever no matter what.\" Well, that's a fine and noble thing to say. But you owe it to yourself to examine the arguments against Christian theology. Your life could be a much happier one without the threat of eternal torment hanging over your head. If you're from a hardcore Christian backgr ound, you were probably brough t up in a very closed-minded world. Don't assume that what you were taught is the truth. The Renunciation of the Trinity: Once you're ready to perform the rite, the exact words of your renunciation of the Trinity should be written by you, in your own words, as one more way for you to take full, deliberate responsibility for it in the sight of \"God\". Make it venomous, contemptuous, utterly demeaning toward the Christian \"God,\" and customized to the particulars of your own religious upbringing. Include separate and distinct denunciations of each of the three persons of the Trinity. But keep it short enough and simple enough so that you can memorize it easily. If you're an ex-Catholic, you may wish to renounce the Trinity in the context of a full-fledged Black Mass. If you're an ex-Protestant, or if you're an ex-Catholic without enough time or resources to perform a Black Mass, then the following much simpler rite will be more than adequate. If you're an ex-Catholic, then you may want to include blasphemy against Mary as well as the Trinity. Do the ritual three nights in a row, in a room unlit except by a single black cand le. Each night, as the centerpiece of the ritual, say your renunciation three times. While saying the renunciation, you might find it helpful to drive the point home to your subconscious mind by performing a sacrilegious gesture against some symbol of Christianity. Whether this is necessary (or even helpful) will depend on the individual. For most people who perform this rite, blasphemous words alone will probably suffice."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Others may need or want more than just words. One traditional gesture is to put a Christian symbol on the floor and stomp on it. Alternatively, if you prefer, place the symbol in a dish and spit on it, or even, perhaps, urinate or defecate on it. For most people, the potent ial messiness and general yuckiness of those last two gestures would probably be too much of a distraction from the desired solemnity of the rite -- especially if you're female. However, it's up to you to decide. The symbol you desecrate (if you choose to do so) can be a crucifix or, perhaps, either a consecrated Host (if you're an ex-Catholic) or a small pocket Bible (if you're an ex-Protestant, especially if you were brought up in a church that emphasized the inerrancy of the Bible). To obtain a consecrated Host, attend church and take the Sacrament in your mouth but don't swallow it. To obtain a Bible, don't buy one, but use one of those free Gideon Bibles that are available in hotels or distributed by some st reetcorner evangelists. Alternatively, don't use an entire Bible but just use printouts of some passages from an online Bible. When you perform the rite, the renunciation will probably bring up a lot of repressed emotions. Both before and after the renunciation, I recommend saying a brief prayer to Enki (or whatever else you do instead of \"prayer,\" if you don't like the word \"prayer\" for whatever reason). The exact nature of the prayer is up to you, and may depend on both your current beliefs and the reasons why you decided to do this ritual in the first place. As default options, I would suggest the following: Before the renunciation: (1) your favorite general invocation (such as, perhaps, this invocation to Enki, if you like it), followed by (2) asking Enki (or Lilith) to help you free yourself from any lingering power of the Christian \"God\" over your life. After the renunciation: a very brief prayer of praise to Enki/Lilith as liberator. I recommend that the renunciation be said facing east, the direction traditionally associated with Christ. Truth-Seeker's Blasphemy Rite and Self-Baptism: Introdu ction"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The ritual on this page is intended for people who, for whatever reason, do not wish to perform an y of the more classic blasphemy rites. This ritual need not involve any irrevocable declarations (a la the renunciation rite). Nor does it need to involve \"blasphemy\" in the sense of crude insults against the Christian god. It may involve crude insults if you feel that including them would be helpfu l to you as a catharsis, but they are not essential to the rite. Different people have different feelings about this. Even without crude insults, this ritual is still \"blasphemous\" in a sense that once was quite illegal in all of Christendom. In the Middle Ages and for a couple of centuries thereafter, anyone caught performing anything remotely like this ritual - or the preparation for it - would surely have been burnt at the stake . Likewise in many Muslim count ries today, it would surely earn you a death penalty for blasphemy. This rite has the same pur pose as other blasphemy rites - to help you rid yourself of unwanted unconscious baggage left over from your background. (See “The Purpo se of Blasphemy in Paganism”.) If you are from a Christian or Muslim background, it is hoped that this ritual - and the preparation for it - will help you get over such things as the fear of hell. In the instructions below, it is assumed that the target of your \"blasphemy \" will be Christianity. However, if you are from a non- Christian backgr ound, or if your parents were nomina lly Christian but you never were taught to take Christianity seriously, then the target of your blasphemy should probably be something else, as appropriate: either another religion or a nonreligious ideology. The point is to help you free yourself from the lingering after-effects of some dogma which you once took seriously, but which you no longer believe on a conscious level. This ritual can be easily adapted to other targets. Preparation For two or three months before you perform the rite, participate regularly in at least one online religious debate forum (or other relevant debate forum, if the ideology you need to free yourself from is nonreligious). Save copies of all your posts, and save copies of the better posts by other people. Also save copies of things that occurred to you to say in a post to the forum and which do reflect your honest thought s and feelings, but which you decided not to say public ly because they"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"were too rude. After two or three months, go back throu gh all the posts and notes you've saved and pick out a collection of memorable, pithy remarks which eloquent ly voice your thoughts and feelings about Christianity and the Christian god. Using a word processing program, put all these quotes into one file. Use a font big enough so that when you print out the file, you'll be able to read it easily by candlelight or perhaps by the light of a small flashlight. The point of the ritual will be to drive home to your subconscious mind the thing s you've learned from the debate. In the debate itself, make an all-out effort to convince your oppon ents themselves, not merely to discredit your opponents to other s in the forum. A Socratic approach is recommended. Ask lots of questions. Be scrupulously honest. Avoid straw-man arguments and other logical fallacies. When caught in an error, promptly admit it and apo logize. A willingness to admit your mistakes will make you appear more honest and more trustworthy. And a commitment to honesty during the debate will help you feel more confident about the statements you end up using in your ritual. On the other hand, when selecting quotes for use in your ritual, different criteria should be applied. Remember, your subconscious mind is not logical. So, the most important criteria here are pithines s and emotional resonance. If possible, your collection of quotes should cover quite a few different objections to Christianity (or whatever other ideology you've left), but at the same time should be short enough that you can easily read the whole thing aloud, slowly, with pauses of up to half a minute between quotes, in no more than twenty minutes to a half hour. For example, you could use ten to fifteen very brief quotes plus a few longer ones. Then, in your own words, write a brief prayer of thanksgiving to Enki for having led you out of Christianity (or whatever). The prayer should be personalized to your situation and should mention those aspects of Christianity (or whatever) which you personally found most oppressive.

Pause briefly, and then read your collection of quotes. Read them one at a time, pausing briefly after each one. Don't time your pauses by watching a clock. Just pause as long as feels natural to you.

Cheap or foul smelling incense can be a major embarrassment and can also be insulting to the spirits. The Incense Burner is both of the element of FIRE and the element of AIR. Avoid manufactured cone/stick incense. Resins or Essential Oils (not blended) are quite pleasant. BELL: is used to signal the beginning and end of the ritual. The ringing of the Bell clears the air in preparation for ritual. It is rung in open ing by turning widdershins (counter -clockwise) and at the end of ritual by turning deosil (clockwise). BOOK OF SHADOWS/SPE LLBOOK: is your own private journal of ritual and magickal workings; their outcome, what you did and when and how you did it, spirit communications and manifestations. A private record you can keep and refer to recording all of your experiences in detail. We recommend you keep track of your meditations and any changes, as well as dream occurrences. CRYSTALS: have many uses and you should find a place you can go to where you can handpick your own. You will need lodestone to charge any daggers or swords to magickal use. I will put a list of chakral correspondences and crystals on this site. You may need those crystals from time to time to restore energy or to aid with chakral blockages. Another good use is to have some ar ound to offer Gods/Goddesses upon evoking. SIGILS: You may w ish to create a sigil to symbolize the name of a certain god or goddess that you wish to evoke. You may use cuneform text or hieroglyphics to create a sigil, symbol, or signature. Additional Items: *Note: The following items must be blessed for use. Please see Rituals for the appropriate instructions. BLACK SCRYING MIRROR: for seeing what the Gods look like;"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"communication. OUIJA BOARD: for communication with Gods and Spiri ts. PENDULUMS: to ask yes/no questions over signatures of Gods, to find lost objects, to find places of magickal operation, etc. I prefer a choice of crystal pendulums that I use. Each has a different vibratory rate."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"RITUALS © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients Ritual is the very heart of magick. For it is through ritual that we achieve our magickal results. It is a magickal procedure or ceremony we perform in order to change the environment. Magickal goals for a ritual should not be taken lightly. The successful practice of magick depends upon strong belief. The simplest ritual must be belief itself. If you can believe in your desired results strongly enough, that act is a magickal ritual which will achieve your results. Even a very complex ritual is no more effective than strong belief. There are aids to concentration which may help. Thus in creative visualization, imagination and controlled breathing are brought into play. The following are rituals and/or blessings that you might need at some point. Please follow the instructions with each one. Alter Set-Up The ultimate alter should be moveable and one should be able to walk completely around it. If that is not possible, then try to set up your alter so that you can face East. Your items should sit on the alter as follows: The Athame (Air) - Center - East edge Earth Symbol (Earth) - Center - North edge Cup (Water) - Center - South edge Incense/Burner (Fire) - Center - West edge Note: If you consecrated the Athame to fire and the incense burner to air, just switch places. Put your candle in the NE corner so you don’t burn yourself from reaching across the alter. Your burning bowl should be in the NW corner and bell in the SW corner. Keep things simple by writing your rituals on index cards so you have room to work. You can have your prayer written and ready by putting it on the center of the alter."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Standard Ritual: It is a good idea to always bathe before ritual. This shows respect. Light your incense and let it burn 10-15 minutes to fill the room. Write any prayers, thanksgi vings and/or requests out on clean paper. Light your candles.

INVOCATION TO ENKI: In the Name of Enki, Ruler of the Earth, True God, Who hast created all of humanity, I invite the Forces of light to bestow their power upon me. I ask you to come forth to greet me as your friend and one of your blessed children. Father Enki g rant me freedom from illusion and show me your kind wisdom and unde rstanding.

This is now the height of your ritual where you read your prayer to Enki. When you are finished, light the paper in the flame of your candle and place it in your bowl to burn. Now is the time for meditation and focus. After the meditation is when you talk with Enki or do other operations that you might have planned. After this, more prayers can be said that are your own or on the website. At the end of your ritual close with a HAIL ENKI!! Ring the bell to signify the end of the ritual. Consecrating & Empowering Ritual Tools To purify and consecrate your tools during a full Moon, you will need to place them upon your altar or other suitable area. If your incense burner has not been blessed, you can use an ash tray or some othe r burn proof receptacle for your incense. If you are empowering an athame, you will need lodestone. Begin by lighting your incense. Items will be passed through the smoke of the incense to be consecrated. You will also need one dark candle (black, blue, or red).

All of a sudden a person will feel mysterious entities, and hear voices. Oh please, this gives me a headache! It’s obvious that some people do not take the time to STUDY first or there would be a realization that in any magickal operation, there is no instant result. Not ever. Not in any system of magick. Briefly: The Dedication Ritual is about Transformati on. You are born again or renewed (spiritually) through Enki. It’s a powerful ritual. When I dedicated, I felt incredible power. I didn’t see, hear, or expect entities to be around at this time. Perhaps someone was there but that was not the point. We’re still left with people wondering why they can’t get close to the Father , can’t hear his voice, don’t know how to evoke the Gods, etc. Hopefully most of you reading have figured this out already. This is about laziness. This is about “I don’t want to read and figure it out on my own so I’ll just ask.” To be strong in Enki is to be strong with knowledge. Asking someone else might clue you in a little bit. But to really know what you are doing is to study the information provided on respective websites. 1. Know the God or Goddess you intend to summon. This website lists the attributes and available knowledge about different Gods. 2. It is important to have a specific purpose; know exactly why you are summoning a particular God. 3. When we ask assistance from a God, it is only proper to offer something in return. Be prepared to give something in return. This is something both you and the Gods should agree upon. Remember, the Elder Gods value one’s word, honesty, integrity and one’s honor as the utmost importance. Never agree to anything you that know you cannot follow through on. 4. Know the method you plan to use to communicate with the God."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"5. You only need to do an official evocation for a particular God or Goddess one time. It will not be necessary to do an evocation after you have established a relationship with this particular deity. Following the first evocation, you need only call out for his/her name, or he/she may often decide to visit by their own free will. 6. If you are trying to contact a specific god or goddess, it is imperative that you call out or chant his/her name several times in a row to be sure that you have gotten their attention before assuming that they are in your presence. Be sure to call his/her name at a volume that is loud enough for them to hear you. Don't assume that you are always heard on the first call. It is a very big universe. Give them ample time to respond."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"METHODS OF COMMUN ICATION © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients Telepathic Uplinks/Clairaudience : This is the ability that everyone scrambles to achieve by doing Awakenings I & II (see meditations). What people don’t seem to understand is it could take months, maybe a year or more to “hear” with any kind of consistency. The sound comes from, both inside and outside of your head. I urge readers to take this time to do power meditations and do not slack. Learn how to do the void meditation. Once you are able to hear, you will possibly be plagued by the constant noise that enemy beings make. If you are not prep ared for this, the enemy will break you down. Psychic Vision : Sight goes hand in hand with psychic hearing and the two develop at about the same rate. This ability is especially nice to have because you can see who the hell you’re dealing with and there’s less chance of astral deception, although the enemy is clever, and you still must remain cautious in what you believe. Scrying : This operation is done by use of the black mirror. You can purchase one or make your own. To scry takes intense concentration and patience. It is much like looking into a black pool of water. I prop my mirror up on a plate holder stand. The room must be very dark but with some candle light. You do not want the candle shining through the mirror or into the mirror, causing a reflection. As you look deeply you will eventually see the mirror become misty or clouded. At that point you are half-way and must go in deeper. Keep relaxing your mind and body. When you begin to see images, you are very close to who you wish to see (or what god or goddess you requested). Keep going! Talking Boards : These come in several varieties, and are available on Ebay, or Amazon for reasonable prices. It has been suggested one can construct their own Ouija board but for smooth operation, I don’t recommend it. Getting used to working with a board is not as easy as it may seem. At first it is a little stiff and you may feel as though you are moving the planchette. This requires some relaxation. Allow yourself to sense the god or goddess you are trying to communicate with. A little breeze, a candle spark, some tingling will indicate a presence. Be sure to ask for Enki or a specific God, then ask if that being is there with you and wait for a response on the Ouij a board. Ask your questions out loud or silently. Put both hands on the planch ette. You will feel a “tug”"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"in the direction it wants to go. As it gets moving, it will speed up. As you get used to this method, you will almost “hear” the answer as it is relayed to you on the board, as if it is being confirmed for you. The talking board is a very popula r method of communication with the Gods. Pendulu ms : This is my preferred method. Most of the time I only need yes or no answers and this is exactly what the pendulum gives. Use Father ’s signature or a God/Goddess' signature to ask questi ons that only require yes or no responses. Once again, you summon who you wish to speak to, and then ask if that being is there. The pendulu m will swing “yes” as the being’s energy grows stronger in your presence. Sometimes you will need to rephrase a question to be more specific because they work with so many of us and they don’t remember every single thing that goes on in our lives. I use crystal pendulu ms designed for this operation. They hang on a chain from a ball at the top. To be accurate, you must never get you fingers in the way of the chain. You’ll notice where the top of the chain links to the ball. Do not touch or cover your fingers over that as well. There is enough room on the ball to hold it with two fingers without disrupting the pendulum. You hold lightly and rest your elbow on a desk or alter while holding the pendulum over top the sigil. When the pendulu m swings up and do wn, your answer is yes. When it swings left and right, your answer is no. If it swings in a circle, it could mean a few things. Being attuned to the entity you are speaking to will reveal what that means. Sometimes they just want to express concern. Other times it is uncertainty. I try to work with the same God /Goddess so I get to know his/her signals. Note: Before you use any of these items, be sure to properly bless and consecrate them. (See Rituals.)"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"NO INTERFERENCE POLICY © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients This policy is of Enki and the gods. It is largely misunderstood by many of Enki's followers. They cannot figure out why the gods didn’t come when they were in trouble or when something was going on. Enki does not run on autopilot. The Policy works in several ways. If you are faced by phantasms or enemy angels and don’t ha ve the skills to realize that they have the ability to become imposters of gods and goddesses, you may spend a length of time (or days) believing these are your friends. The real gods cannot interfere with this. For as long as you believe what you see or hear, nothin g can stop it. But as angels and phantasms go, they tend to get overly confident. The tip-off is usually the drama, discomfort, conflict, or too good to be true aspects of their presentation. This should be a red flag for you! Call out for Enki or your patron God/dess! Evoke! You’ll know the enemy are imposters if they try to talk you out of that. Enki has told us during our troubling times with phantasms, he and the the gods have stood by and watched sadly as there was nothing they could do. Yes, we’ve been through it. It’s a terrible experience. I will relate some of this later. “ If one doesn’t ask, we don’t tell them.” The above statement is exactly that. If you think you know everything, and you think you have all your facts without asking Enki, then you are a fool. Every item going in this book is guided by the gods and read by Enki. This is Enki’s book. Not mine. In regards to conflicting information we have found on what is otherwise deemed very good web resources, we have been told by several Gods that the site administr ator “has not asked.” People ask me, “Why can’t the gods just tell that person, if they claim to be in contact these gods and goddesses.” No. That person must ask specifically about the questionable content. In certain situations, the gods or goddesses might int erfere on certain issues. The above rule may not always apply.

No More Mr. Nice Guy! One of the first things you will do is learn how to empower yourself. You will also learn how to become ‘thick-skinned’ against many odds. Being weak, lazy, doubtful, and unabl e to make decisions, lacking faith in the gods, or holding onto fear (which is the worst thing) will lead you straight to disaster. We have had many experiences with what I am about to discuss. The beings listed below are elusive to those who have no abilities. Sound without sight is also a huge problem because some of these beings can pretend to be gods... at least for a little while. They are also easier to hear, and most likely the first beings you will encounter when you begin to hear, psychically. (I will discuss telepathic uplinks later.) If you find yourself in a situation that is in discord with Enki, call out to the Fathe r. You say, “I had this experience. There seems to be something wrong with it, and I don’t believe it. Can you please tell me what is wrong with this picture/scenario?” Due to the “No Interference Policy” of the Gods, if you believe something, they are going to allow you to continue believing it. You must be able to phrase your question as stated above in order for them to be able to help. You build your armor with bio-electrical light. You clean your armor. You do this daily. You are not going to ring Enki’s phone off the hook over every little problem! While there will be times when you do call out (and believe me, things can get ugly), other times you don’t need to.

The electrical activity of the brain has been observed and classified with EEG (electroencephalograph) equipment; signals picked up from the scalp by electrodes, then filtered and amplified, drive a graph recorder. Brain activity has been found to produc e specific ranges for certain basic states of consciousness, as indicated in 'hz' (hertz, or cycles/vibrations per second). The 4 states of conciousness are as follows: delta -- 0.2 to 3.5 hz (deep sleep, trance state), theta -- 3.5 to 7.5 hz (day dreaming, memory), alpha -- 7.5 to 13 hz (tranqu ility, heightened awareness, meditation), beta -- 13 to 28 hz (tension, 'normal' consciousness). As you can see, some form of physical relaxation is implied in the alpha , theta, and delta consciousness. These states are in fact reached through deep breathing, hypnosis, and other relaxation techniques. OOBE occurs during these states, and delta is probably the most importan t for it. The problem is really, as we have said, one of maintaining mental awareness and alertness while experienceing these altered states. Experimenta l subjects hooked to an EEG do not show a discrete change from drowsy to sleep; it is very gradual. At the thresh old between sleep and waking consciousness is a drowsy condition known as the hypnogogic state. OOBE seems to occur during this state, or a variant of it. By careful control of the hypnogogic state (not going beyond it) it is possible to enter OOBE directly . PARAPSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHIC PHENOMENA © 2004 Amber K. Through parapsychology, we are at last beginning to gain insights into the hidden nature of man. Parap sychology is a branch of psychology which studies psychic phenomena. Remarkable evidence has been gathered on numerous cases of psychic phenomena."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Knowledge gained from parapsychology studies can be applied, so far as it goes, to the much broader based, much more theoretical study and practice of magick. Thus, the human mind and body appears to broadcast psychic energy or force, much like a radio station. Kirlian photog raphy and cloud chamber tests tend to support this theory. Although the exact nature of this psychic force is subtle and unknown, it is undoubtedly the energy behind all psychic phenome na and ma gick. However, it is *not* a radio wave, since it beha ves somewhat differently. The psychic force is too weak to be measured directly (at least so far as we know). Everyone has some psychic ability. There are numerous types of psychic phenomena. Parapsychology separates them into two groups: ESP and PK. EXAMPLES OF ESP ESP, the abreviation for extra sensory perception, means the reception of information through paranormal means (ie. not regular physical senses of sight, sound, touch, smell, or taste). In theory, this is accomplished by receiving psychic force from outside the body. Here are some examples of ESP: 1. Clairvoyance, or Remote Viewing -- the ability to sense or 'see' (non- physically) distant objects, places, and people. Individuals who see ghosts and spirits are probably clairvoyant. 2. Astral Projection (OOBE) or Traveling Clairvoyance. Full experience at a remote location while the physical body sleeps. 3. Psychometry -- the reading of information by the touch of physical objects. 4. Telepathic receiver -- the ability to directly receive thought (communication) at a distance, with no physical connection to the sender. There are many everyday examples of this, in which we think something just as another person is about to say it. This is an easy one to test for through experiment. Very dramatic cases of telepathy have been recorded; there is often an emotional element in such cases. 5. A medium, as in a seance. 6. Experience with a Ouija board, pendulum, or automatic writing. 7. Precognition -- to forsee the future. Again, highly emotional events are the ones most likel y to be 'tuned in'."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"EXAMPLES OF PK PK, the abreviation for psychokinesis, is the active or sending side of psychic phenomena. The theory here is that psychic force is sent out from the indi vidual. Examples of PK include: 1. Telepathic sender -- the transmitter in the telepathy just discussed. 2. Psychokinesis (or telekin esis) proper -- the ability to move objects by means of psychic force. 3. Somewhat along the same lines are poltergeist (noisy ghost) phenomena in which objects move of their own accord or noises are heard. There is always a human agent involved -- frequently a teenage girl -- who appears to be the source of psychic energy. 4. Psychic healing -- the ability to heal various illnesses and infirmities. There are many documented cases of this. Usually it involves a healer and a subjec t, although there are recent cases invloving cancer patients learning to heal themselves. 5. Teleportation, apportation, and levitation. Some occultists feel a magician producing PK effects is simply a channel for universal energy. Others think the force originates some way directly within the magician. THE 4 WORLDS © 2004 Amber K. The ancients described man as mind, bod y, and soul. Psychologists of the twentieth century added the subconscious to that definition. This produces a four-fold classification. The universe is also divided into four corresponding parts ('worlds'), as shown below: World, Body, & Quality: spiritual world, spiritual body (soul or kia), intuition mental world, mental body (conscious mind), rational thought astral world, astral body (subcon scious), emotions physical world, physical body, physical senses The astral body (subconscious) is the intermediary for intuition,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"magical and psychic phenomena, and is the 'psychic link' to the physical world. Most occult and magical phenomena originate in the invisible, non-sensate, non-phys ical realm (ie. without physical senses). Each of the four worlds interacts with the other worlds. Psychic energy flows from the spiritual to mental to astral to physical. The physical world is a projection (manifestation, reflection, or shadow) of the higher worlds. Our center of consciousness is generally within these higher worlds. \"We are\", to quote the rock music group the Police, \"spirits in the material world\". There are many similar terms used by other occult groups. For example, 'astral light' is another name for astral world, although it may sometimes also refer to the entire non-physical realm, as may 'inner planes' or 'the invisible world'. Planes are essentially the same as worlds. Vehicles or sheaths are the same as bodies. Some groups include an etheric or vital body between physical and astral: it is mostly 'physical' with a little of the lower 'astral' besides. And sometimes astral and mental are each divided into two parts (upper and lower). The 'causal body' is the upper 'mental' . ASTRAL PROJECTION © 2004 Amber K. Astral projection (OOBE, out of the body experience) is a popula r area of occult literature; for traveling to see other worlds and places while the physical body sleeps or is entranced is an exciting notion. Astral projection is not dangerous. It is as safe as sleeping. Most dreams are probably unconscious astral projections, anyway. Although there has been quite a bit written on the subject, astral projection is difficult for many people. The main difficulty is the tendency to forget dream consciousness upon awakening. Accordingly, the successful practice of astral projection requires work. Moder n psychology discounts the idea of actual OOBE (that the spirit temporarily vacates the physical body). However, the idea is very ancient. The Tibetans have an entire system of yoga (dream yoga) based upon astral projection. And here we have an important assumption: you are involved in an OOBE (at least to a degree) whenever you dream.What sets it apart from a full OOBE is your hazy consciousness during the experience and poor recall afterwards. Many people forget"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"most of their dreams completely. Learning astral projection requires a kind of inner mental clarity and alertness. Dreams are a door to the subconscious which can be used for psychological and spiritual insight, and sometimes for precognition. Dream content is influenced by external sounds and sensations. For example, a loud external noise (such as a train) will likely appear in your dream (if it doesn't wake you up!). Dreams are also influenced by events of the previous day, by your moods, and by suggestion. Everyone normally dreams 4 or 5 times a night (about every 2 hours). The longest dreams occur in the morning. Everyone dreams. You are more likely to remember the details of your dream when you first wake up. By keeping a dream diary you will improve dream recall. Have writing equipme nt or a tape recorder at your bedsid e for this purpose; also a light which isn't too bright. Suggest to yourself several times before you go to sleep, \"I will awaken with the knowledge of a dream.\" Then when you do awaken, move quietly (sometimes just turning over drives the idea away). Remember first, then write the dream down, and then add as many details as possible. The next day check for objective facts and expand if you can (by remembering 'what happene d before that'). Once you start remembering your dreams in this way, it will become easier to do so. If you are unsuccessful at this, and really want to remember your dreams, you could arrange for someone to sit by your bedside all night long with a dim light on. Then when he sees your eyes moving back and forth -- rapid eye movements, a sign you are dreaming -- he can wake you and ask for a dream report. FORMS OF ASTRAL PROJECTION Astral projection may be subdivided into three basic types: mental projection, astral projection (proper), and etheric projection. Your OOBE may shift between them. Mental projection is really simple clairvoyance ('remote viewing'), and 'traveling in your mind'. Imagination plays a key role. The experience of mental projection is not particularly vivid, and you will more likely be an observer than a participant. Nevertheless, mental projection is an important 'way in' to astral projection proper. During mental projection and astral projection you are able to travel through solid objects, but are not able to act directly upon them or to move them (if they are in the physical world). This is not true during etheric projection. Whether it is simply subconscious expectation, or whether it is a true etheric projection which in theory means that part"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"of your physical body has been relocated with your projection (the etheric or vital part) may be difficult to determine. Etheric projections generally travel at or very near the physical world. There are even cases reported (very, very rare ones) in which the entire physical body is transferred to another location (teleportation), or cases in which the physical body exists and acts in two separate places at once (bilocation)! But our primary interest is astral projection proper, and mental projection to a lesser extent. Astral and mental projection are not confined to the physical world. Travel in the mental and astral realms is feasible, and often preferred. Nor are astral and mental projection restricted to the realm of the earth (you could even go to the moon and plan ets). DEVELOPING CLAIRVOYANCE © 2004 Amber K. It is possible to improve your natural ability with clairvoyance through practice. A good start might be to look around you, then close your eyes and try to picture your surroundings. This is also good exercise for visualization. Visualization is an essential talent in magick. Open your eyes again and check your accuracy. Then close your eyes and try it again. When you use your physical eyes, look at everything like a child seeing it for the first time. Let the vividness of color and form burn into you, until everything takes on a veritable glow. Try to capture that glow when you close your eyes now and picture your surroundings. It's just a simple step to extend what you see with your eyes closed into what you remember seeing in the next room, or what you *imagine* seeing in the next building , the next city, even the other side of the world. Don't expect perfect results, especially at first. Just try to be even partly right. Another exercise is to picture a clock face, and thereby tell the time clairvoyantly. THE AURA © 2004 Amber K. Under the right conditions, it is possible to clairvoyantly observe a"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"colored light around other people. This is known as the 'aura'. Sometimes the aura is seen as multi-colored emanations around the person, built up of various differently colored layers and zones. Although many occult dabble rs claim to be able to see the aura easily and under many varied conditions, I seriously doubt that they do. There are optical illusions and qualities of sight which can sometimes trick one into thinking he sees what he does not see. In this area, the quality of sight known as after image is especially pertinent. Do this: stare at any solidly colored bright object for a few moments. Very intense red, green, or blue are especially good for this. Now look away at a white surface and you will see a phanto m image of the object in its compleme ntary color - a red object will show green, a blue one - orange, etc. If the bright object is in front of a light surface, you may observe a fringe of complement ary color around the object after a few moments. This is all very normal, and is used by some magical groups as an aid to visualization sometimes called 'flashing colors'. Some silly people will stare at other people in the same way. And when they see the after image of the person's clothing, they think they are seeing his aura. What is more, various meanings have been attributed to the colors of the aura. A psychic who can see the aura is supposed to be able to determine that persons emotional state. Thus psychic frauds can have a marvelous time with auras. One deluded psychic taught a class I attended in which he performed instant psychoanalysis on the basis of the suppos ed aura.

However, where clairvoyance is seeing, clairaudience is hearing. Clairaudience is often more difficult to pin down than clairvoyance, and carries the same stigmas attached to it. The main example being if you claim to ‘hear voices’, it’s automa tically assumed that you suffer from psychosis. This is unfortun ate, given that with most cases I’ve seen, the clairaudient is very much sane. As with clairvoyance, the two main forms of ‘clear-hearing’ come as either physical or non-physical - the latter of which is often referred to as mindspeech. Physical, in itself, can be of a large range of things, although undoubtedly the most publicised is the ‘voices’ - speaking to spirits. When someone is being ordered to do things against their nature by voices, it could either be a genuine case of mental instability, or clairaudient communication with a mischievous or malicious spirit. In either case, it’s a disorder that must be corrected. I don’t pretend to believe that all people in mental institutions are clairaudients, but nor do I accept that all of them are crazy, in the common unde rstanding of the word. Unrestrained clairaudience can be an enormous drain on both spirit and body, especially in cases where it is dealing with other sentient spirits. So a working knowledge in that area is essential before trying to use it in any great depth. But this field is not just limited to conversations with spirits, although that is one of the main areas, in my experience. Another facet of the physical hearing is picking up on higher frequen cies. In the modern world, ruled by computers, radios, televisions, and othe r electrical"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"devices, high frequency signals are constantly being sent through the air - some lower, and some higher than others. Some clairaudients find this a problem, tuning in to useless and unwanted ‘white noise’. Speaking from personal experience, it has recently become almost impossible for me to spend any length of time around certain electrical items. Photocopiers, security systems, and some computers are the worst, to my ears, giving off a high-pitched whining sound that is often physically painful. This is a new development, only surfacing in the last few years after I have been working on my clairaudience. My focus is apparently complete ly in the higher frequencies, as I find my normal hearing - on the lower levels - to be a bit below average, and I’m not far short of deaf to people with very low pitched voices, which can be very frustrating. I’ve heard similar accounts from other people, everything from televisions to electrical power lines. While hearing spirits can be either physical or non-physical hearing, tuning in to the electrical frequencies is - to my knowledge -always physical. While hearing spirits physically can often be better verification, it’s more common to hear them non-physically, using mindspeech. I often think of it as our thoughts being our astral voices. Mindsp eech can, of course, be used for other things, one purpose that springs to mind bein g communication with friends or family over long distances. As you can imagine it’s very hard to distinguish between speaking to another person/spirit and talking to yourself when it all happen s inside your head. There are methods though: different energy signatures (ie, ‘feel’), different voice/accent/style, and new knowledge not already known by the recipient. It is very much an acquired skill to be able to know the difference, and one that only comes with practice and a great deal of patience. This are many things that can be done with clairaudience. I’ve had endless hours of fascinating conversation with different spirits, learning new things and teaching in return. (note: Common sense should obviously be used when choosing to speak with another spirit, and it’s advised that you be proficient in at least some form of psychic protection - as it’s better to be safe than sorry). It can also be used in psychic readings, or other divination techniques to find info rmation otherwise hidden. And it is helpful as a personal guide when focussing on intuition. The possibilities are limited only by your perception."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CREATIVE VISUALIZATION © 2004 Amber K. When you want to magically achieve something, first picture it clearly in your mind. The more definite and specific your idea of what it is the better. Picture yourself having it or doing it. Visualize it as vividly and as intensely as you can and hold it in your thoughts for a few moments. Concentrate on it intensely (it may help to hold your breath). Feel the energy of desire welling up inside you. Then sudden ly feel the image or desire released from your mind. Feel the energy filtering through the image and intensifying it, as if the image is a 'stencil'. Imagine the energy exploding out from you into the macrocosm in all directions at once, and feel the universe 'tilt' as it reacts to the force. (At the same time it may help to release your breath suddenly). Feel the energy draining from you. Finally, believe that your purpose has been accomplished; that it has happen ed, perhaps saying somethin g such as so mote it be, or it is done. AFFIRMATIONS © 2004 Amber K. The mind is always open to suggestion -- especially the subc onscious. Most of the time we censor any suggestions according to the model; but one way to break through the censor is with repetition. An affirmation does this exactly. By suggestion, we mean any statement which is capable of affecting your model. Usually suggestion is in the form of a positive statement (such as the hypnotist's patter -- \" You are becoming sleepy\"). An affirmati on is the same ki nd of thing -- a positive suggestion, which you repeat (affirm) to yourself aloud or silently (for example, \"I remember my dreams\"). If there is some quality you wish to change or develop within yourself, an affirmati on is ideal. Repeat it several times every day at several different times throughout the day, especially when you go to bed. Affirmations are subtle and may requ ire a few months to work. Use them for changes, not miracles. DIRECTED ATTENTION © 2004 Amber K. Your mind follows your attention. Wherever you direct your attention, there will your thought s go too. By directing attenti on to a specific place"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"or purpose you *focus* mental energy upon it. For example: you're having lunch in a cafeteria crowded with people. It is a large place, and everyone there is talking at once, so that the room is a constant jumble of noise. You happen to notice a man accross the room; he reminds you of someone. All at once he drops his fork and you hear it hit the table. Would you have noticed the sound of his fork if you had not been looking ? No. Only by focusing your attention there were you able to pick out that individual event and associated sound. It is a dark night. You are walking and the only light you have is from the flashlight you hold in your hand. As you move the flashlight around, the beam of light from it directs your attention first one way then another. Now, themind is something like that flashlight in the dark. And by directed attention, you point the mind to one place or another. As with that flashlight beam, you see where the mind is pointed; nothing more. The rest is 'noise'. And so we could define mental noise as anything not focused upon. In another way, noise could be considered as negative emotion s, attitudes, and thoughts which make it more difficult to direct the attention. Your emotion s follow your thoughts quite easily. Your emotions are not you, but are rather reactions prompted by your model and ego -- like a performance or an act, while the real you watches. In a similar way, directing your attention toward a specific emotion will cause you to experience that emotion. INVOCATION © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients Invoking a deity is a way of channe ling the energy of a god or goddess in to your own body allowing them to control and speak through you. In all cases this must be done with extreme caution. This should never be done by a novice. In every case one should be very familiar with the deity that you wish to invo ke. Let's face it, not every entity on the astral is who they claim to be. If you have any doubt about the credibility of the entit y in which you are invoking, this should not be attempted. You must make sure that you know and trust the entity 100 percent. To invoke a deity, you must first call upon the deity that you wish to invoke. You may wish to chant the deity's name several times and tell him/her that you are attempting to invoke them. If you have never seen"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"or met this deity before, you should not attempt this until you are very familiar with his/her appearance, energy, voice, and presence. This may take months to establish a bond of trust. Once you know the appearance, energy, voice, and presence of the deity, then you may feel free to invoke them. Under these circumstances, you should still use caution. Do not ever give any entity complete control of your mind and body. The invocation process requires you to chann el the energy of the deity directly through your body allowing him/her to speak throu gh you. You will have to establish a firm connection between you and the deity while being relaxed enough to let their energy flow through your body giving them an element of control. This can be very dangerous if you do not know what you are doing. You will have to let go of yourself in order to give them this element of control they need to speak and move freely while using your body. At no time shou ld you ever surrender complete control. This body is your vehicle. You are the driver. You are the owner. You simply want the deity to reach over and grab the wheel to briefly steer you in a certain direction. They are only the passenger. At no time should your foot ever leave the brake. You should always be ready to stop at your own will. You must never allow yourself to lose this element of control. Your vehicle cannot be stolen unless you allow the pass enger to kick you out of the car. You have to allow the deity complete control of your body in order for him/her to completely posess you. A god or goddess of Enki would never posess you. They would never harm you in any way. They would never cause you any physical, mental or emotion al discomfort. These gods and goddesses can be trust ed, but unfortunately there are many entities on the astral who will attempt to imperso nate them just for the sake of misleading and even harming you because of your association to this pantheon. That is why one must use extreme caution when doing such an invocation. Here are some tips on learning how to invoke. Remember the dangers, but do not be afraid to try channeling the energy of a god or goddess. You are in complete control. Just make sure to keep it that way. Be sure that the god or goddess is aware that you are attempting to invo ke them or channel their energy. I learned to do this by channe ling energy through a ouija board. I was able to let them use my body to move the message indicator and gain a certain element of control. From there i gained the ability to let them speak through me and move my body."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Like I said before, this can be dangerous but it is an effective way to increase your communication skills if you do it safely. Some people do not hear very well through clairaudience and this may help for direct line of communication. Do not be careless. Use your best judgement, and know when to quit while you are ahead. Do not be too quick to lend your trust to an entity, but yo u can practice this safely without getting hurt if you are in the presence of a god or goddess who cares about you. Take care of yourself. Know the dangers that exist, and know when to stop. We care about our members, and we don't want any of you getting harmed in any way. I give you this advice, but i tell you to be wise and careful about it. You will not get posessed if you do not allow it to happen. If you feel any negative energy, experience any time loss, or if you are getting invalid information, stop doing this immediately! If you call on a god or goddess to assist you in this process, be sure to call their name several times and call them loud enough so that they can hear you. Invocation is quite common and it can be a positive experience if you take the proper precautions. EXORCISM © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients In cases where one has ignored the previous warnings and allowed themselves to become posessed, you may now have to exorcize the entity. This can be done very easily. I am placing these instructions on this page because some people think that they know everything and they may end up hav ing to learn the hard way that my warnings were not to be ignored. Emergencies can happen. That is why I am adding this information to this website. In cases of posession, a pagan cannot go to a Catholic church for an excorcism. You will not have to. Catholic excorcisms can take da ys and weeks to accomplish because (as we already know) they have no real power to excorcize their own angels and rhp deities. In such cases you would be fighting fire with gasoline. Our method of excorcism should take no more than one or two hours dependin g on the severity of the case. The posessing entities will never tell the host or the exorcist any truth about who they really are. They use these posession cases for the drama factor. They will blame it on a god or a goddess that would never posess"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"or cause harm to a person. This creates fear in the eyes of the public. This causes negative public ity against an innocent deity that has nothing to do with the posession itself. Do not expect any truthful statements or answers from a posessing entity. In any case of posession, the host has allowed this to happen. The host has given complete control to an entity and the blame can only fall upon the host for letting this happen. Assuming that you may be posessed, you may ne ed assistance in your own exorcism, or that of someone you know. Below are instructions for assisting and performing your own exorcism. Most cases can be handled in the following way. 1. Get rid of the entity by starving it out. The moment that you begin to lose control, ignore the entity. Focus your mind on something else. Watch tv or read a book. Whatever you do, make sure that all actions taken are your own. Work out if you have to. Whatever it takes, do not give in to any involuntary activities or motions. Do not allow any form of involuntary speech. This is considered starving it out. 2. If you are assisting an exorcism of someone else, you must make sure to keep a conversation going between yourself and the host. Do not allow the host to lose awareness of who they are. If you find yourself talking to an entity that is using the host, yell the name of the host. Tell them to come back. Once you are in contact with the host, tell them to allow the entity no more freedom. Do not lose contact with this person. Instruct them on starving out the entit y. 3. Often restraining the person is not necessary, but if you have to restrain someone, do it without causing damage or pain to their body. I've never seen any extreme cases where one has to be restrained, but in such cases, do not harm the host! 4. Light is a powerful weapon. The host can begin by lighting up all chakras from base to crown. This may be difficult for the host, but in extreme cases, this may be mandatory. Tell them to keep their chakras lit. This may take force on the part of the host. The unwanted entity may try squelching out the light. They cannot be where there is light. Instruct the host to breathe white light in through the base chakra and push the white light up the spine and release it throu gh the crown chakra. This is what I call flushing out an unwanted entity. Tell them to repeat the process until the entity is gone. 5. For the exorcist, in some cases you may have to assist by using light"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"of your own. While the host is flushing their body with white light from bottom to top, you may use your hand chakra s to force light down through the crown chakra of the host. Internal flushing from both directions may cause the host to hack or vomit. Before this happen s, the entity may surrender and leave on its own. In those cases, you may remove your hand to allow the entity to leave through the top of the crown. Tell the host to keep flushing upward light. If the entity still tries to remain inside of the host, you may have to force light down through the crown again. This may force the entity to leave through the mouth of the host. As stated before, this may cause hacking or vomiting so be prepared. 6. You should call upon the assistance of a god or goddess before taking the measures above. They will be happy to asist, and may be able to stop the posession before it goes too far. We have many trusted gods and goddesses listed on this website who are always more than happy to assist. If caution is taken before and during any invocation, the excorcism will not be needed. HEALTH AND DIET © 2004 Amber K. Certainly the way you treat your physical body will affect your mind. In magick you want an alert mind. The refore your body must be as healthy as you can keep it. Take care of your body. Exercise regularly. Eat a good diet (with vitamin suppl ements), and do not consume anything which will have a negative effect upon the mind. Drugs, smoking, and alcohol should be restricted, or eliminated. (The mind can create any condition which a drug can create.) A good rule here is moderation in what and how much you consume. (Most of this stuff is pretty obvious isn't it.) You may also want to cut down on sugar and processed foods. Many occultists advise dietary changes. We cannot deny the phys ical, psychological, and spir itual effect which all foods have. This effect may be described as the 'heaviness' factor of foods. Various foods are so ranked below, lighter to heavier. 1. lettuce and othe r greens. 2. fruits and most vegetables. 3. wheat, rice, and other grains. 4. nuts, beans, and other legumes. 5. cheese, dairy products, including eggs."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"6. fish, seafood. 7. chicken, poultry. 8. beef, pork, o ther red meats. Note that meats, especially red meats are the 'heaviest' foods. Generally, foods which are harder to digest, or which are higher in protein are heavier than those which are not. Animal products are heavier than plants. Foods high in carbohydrate (candy, bread, starch) are heavy. However, the heaviness of foods is not directly related to the amount of caleries. What this means is that for various reasons, the heaviness of food in your diet will affect your magical experiences. You may be able to increase your psychic receptivity ('energy level') by eating lighter foods, or by eating less. Conversely, emphasizing heavy foods in your diet, or eating larger helpings, may help to 'bring you down to earth' should you 'rent the veil' too much. These are generalizations, of course, and it may take a number of days of dietary change before you notice much effect. I do not advocate radical dietary changes, excessive fasting, or malnutrition. Your good health is far more important in magick than any temporary effect you get from prolonged starvation. A change in diet will sometimes only produce a temporary effect, until the physical body adapts to the change. Healthy natura l foods and lifestyle make it easier for us to be healthy, but ultimately, good health is a mentual quality (attitude)."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAKRA S MAJOR CHAKRAS \"The seven lamps that burn before the throne of God.\" The seven seals are the seven chakras of the human body, ruled by seven signs of the Zodiac constellation. The remaining five signs influence the ethe ric or prana body. The seven cities, societies, trumpet calls and horsemen named in the xian bible (Apocalypse) are secret hints at the seven chakras, their corresponding organs and the sensations experienced by the candidate, for instance at initiation, when Kunda lini awakens and flows in the order of numbering. Once all seals or chakras are opened and conquered by the candida te through moral purity, study, and me ditation, the candidate is dwija or “Twice-born” or “Born again” and has achieved immortality in consciousness. He can leave and reenter his physical body at will. Thus death shall there be no more for him. He or she shall depart in full awareness from the body through the chakra on top of the head (7th seal), to then continu e to live immortall y on the astral, mental and spiritual plane. The 7 chakras are the spiritual centers of the soul. If you open these and empower them correctly, you are on your way to being equal with the Gods. After Enki's creation of humans, the gods and goddesses along with himself, began teaching us the ancient wisdom of how to become as a god through meditation and suppleme nts. This is where they met with serious confrontation and opposition from the other gods. Throug h the spread of Christianity and the destruction of the ancient teachings of the original gods, the 7 chakras have been sealed. The word chakra means wheel of light in the language of Sanskrit. Chakras are the body's internal energy centers, and are aligned vertically near the spine. Energy enters the body through the head (the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"heavens) and the base (the earth beneath). The 7 chakras are vortex points where these forces mingle, with each produc ing a distinctive energy pattern. The purpose of the 7 chakras is to absorb, transform, and distribute the body's internal energy, known by terms like prana, life force, or chi. Specific organs and body parts are associated with each chakra, as well as corresponding behavioral, emotional, and personality patterns. It's important to note that the chakras are in constant interplay, and can really only be separated intellectually.

CHAKRAS AND CRYSTALS by Kellie Jo Conn, GG The word chakra is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning wheel. If we were able to see the chakras (as many psychics, in fact, do) we would observe a wheel of energy continu ously revolving or rotating. Clairvoyants perceive chakras as colorful wheels or flowers with a hub in the center. The chakras begin at the base of the spine and finish at the top of the head. Though fixed in the central spinal column they are located on both the front and back of the body, and work through it. Each chakra vibrates or rotates at a different speed. The root or first chakra rotates at the slowest speed, the crown or seventh chakra at the highest speed. Each chakra is stimulated by its own and complimentary color, and a range of gemstone s for specific uses. The chakra colors are of the rainbow; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The size and brightness of the wheels vary with individual development, physical condition, energy levels, disease, or stress. If the chakras are not balanced, or if the energies are blocked, the basic life force will be slowed down. The individual may feel listless, tired, out of sorts, or depressed. Not only will physical bodily functions be affected so diseases may manifest, but the thought processes and the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"mind may also be affected. A negativeattitude, fear, doubt, etc. may preoccupy the individual. A constant balance between the chakra s promotes health and a sense of well being. If the chakras are opened too much, a person could literally short circuit themselves with too much universal energy going through the body. If the chakras are closed, this does not allow for the univ ersal energy to flow through them properly which may also lead to disease. Most of us react to unpleasant experiences by blocking our feeling and stopping a great deal of our natural energy flow. This affects the maturation and development of the chakras. Whenever a person blocks whatever experience he is having, he in turn blocks his chakras, which eventually become disfi gured. When the chakras are functioning normally, each will be open, spinning clockwise to metabolize the particular energies needed from the universal energy field. As already mentioned any imbalan ces that exist within any chakra may have profound effects upon either our physical or emotiona l bodies. We are able to use our quartz crystals and gemstone s to re-balance all our chakric centers and once the chakra has been properly balanced then our body will gradually return to normal. The reason why crystals and gemstones are wonderful and powerful healing tools are because of what science calls its piezoelectric effect. (You can see this effect in the modern quartz watches). Crystals and gemstones respond to the electricity that is coursing through our body, and if the energy is sluggish, the constant electrical vibrations of the stones will help to harmonize, balance,and stimulate these energies. THE SEVEN MAJOR CHAKRAS FIRST CHAKRA-ROOT Studying the individual chakra s begins with the root chakra, called Muladha ra in Sanskrit. The root chakra is located at the base of the spine at the tailbone in back, and the pubic bone in front. This center holds the basic needs for survival, security and safety. The root chakra provides us with the ability to be grounded into the earth plane. This is also the center of manifestation. When you are trying to make things happen in the material world, business or material possessions, the energy to succeed will come from the first chakra. If this chakra is blocked an indiv idual may feel fearful, anxious, insecure and frustrated. Problems like obesity, anorexia nervosa, and knee"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"troubles can occur. Root body parts include the hips, legs, lower back and sexual organs. The colors used for this chakra are red, brown and black. The gemstone s are Garnet, Smoky Qua rtz, Obsidian, and Black Tourmaline. NOTE: A man¹s sexual organs are located primarily in his first chakra, so male sexual energy is usually experienced primarily as physical. Women¹s sexual organs are located primarily in her second chakra, so female sexual energy is usually experienced primarily as emotiona l. Both chakra s are associated with sexual energy. SECOND CHAKRA-BELLY (SACRAL) The next chakra or second chakra is often referred to as the belly or (sacral). It is located two inches below the navel and is rooted into the spine. This center holds the basic needs for sexuality, creativity, intuition, and self-worth. This chakra is also about friendliness, creativity, and emo tions. It governs peoples sense of self- worth, their confidence in their own creativity, and their ability to relate to others in an open and friendly way. It¹s influenced by how emotions were expressed or repressed in the family during childhood. Proper balance in this chakra means the ability to flow with emotions freely and to feel and reach out to others sexually or not. If this chakra is blocked a person may feel emotion ally explosive, manipulative, obsessed with thought s of sex or may lack energy. Physical problems may include, kidney weakness, stiff lower back, constipation, and muscle spasms. Belly body parts include sexual organs (women), kidneys, bladde r, and large intestine. The main color used with this chakra is orange. The gemstones are Carnelian Agate, Orange Calcite and Tigers Eye. THIRD CHAKRA-SOLAR PLEXUS The third chakra is referred to as the Solar Plexus. It is located two inches below the breastbone in the center behind the stomach. The third chakra is the center of personal power, the place of ego, of passions, impulses, anger and strength. It is also the center for astral travel and astral influences, receptivity of spirit guides and for psychic development. When the Third Chakra is out of balance you may lack confidence, be confused, worry about what others think, feel that others are controlling your life, and may be depressed. Physical problems may include digestive difficulties, liver problems, diabetes, nervous exhaustion, and food allergies. When balanced you may feel cheerful,"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"outgoing, have self-respect, expressive, enjoy taking on new challenges, and have a strong sense of personal power. The body parts for this chakra include the stomach, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, and small intestine. The main color for this chakra is yellow.

It is located behind the breast bone in front and on the spine between the shoulder blades in back. This is the center for love, compassion and spirituality. This center directs one¹s ability to love themselves and others, to give and to receive love. This is also the chakra connecting body and mind with spirit. Almost everyone today has a hard, hurt, or broken heart, and it is no accident that heart disease is the number one killer in America today. Deep heart hurts can result in aura obstructions called heart scars. When these scars are released, they raise a lot of old pain, but free the heart for healing and new growth. When this chakra is out of balance you may feel sorry for yourself, paranoid, indecisive, afraid of letting go, afraid of getting hurt, or unworthy of love. Physical illnesses include heart attack, high blood pressure, insomnia, and difficult in breathing. When this chakra is balanced you may feel compassionate, friendly, empathetic , desire to nurture others and see the good in everyone. Body parts for the fourth chakra include heart, lungs, circulatory system, shoulders, and upper back. The main colors used are pink and green. The gemstone s are Rose Quartz, Kunzite, and Watermelon tourmaline. FIFTH CHAKRA-THROAT The fifth chakra is referred to as the Throat.

Through the power of the sixth chakra, you can receive guidance, channe l, and tune into your Higher Self. When this chakra is not balanced you may feel non-assertive, afraid of success, or go the opposite way and be egotistical. Physical symptoms may include headaches, blurred vision, blindne ss, and eyestrain. When this chakra is balanced and open you are your own master with no fear of death, are not attached to material things, and may experience telepathy or astral travel. Sixth chakra body parts include the eyes, face, and brain, lymphatic and endocrine system. The main colors are purple and dark blue. The gemstones are Amethyst, Sodalite, and Lapis Lazuli. SEVENTH CHAKRA-THE CROWN The seventh chakra is referred to as the Crown. It is located just behind the top of the skull. It is the center of spirituality, enlightenment, dynamic thought and energy. It allows for the inward flow of wisdom, and brings the gift of cosmic consciousness. This is also the center of connectedness with the Goddess (God), the place where life animates the physical body. The silver cord that connects the aura bodies extends from the crown. The soul comes into the body through the crown at birth and leaves from the crown at death. When this chakra is unbalan ced there may be a constant sense of frustration, no spark of joy, and destructive feelings. Illnesses may include migraine headaches and depression.

The skeletal, circulatory, muscular and endocrine systems are examples of this. However, there is also a subtle system that co-ordinates the functioning of these other systems into one harmonious whole; this is the human bio-electrical system. The bio-electrical system is made up of pathways of highe r and lower electrical resistance, known as meridians. Along these pathways are specific points which share these electrical characteristics. These are often referred to as acupunctu re points. There are twelve such meridians, each with a number of points, and each connects to a particular organ. The function of the meridians is to suppl y the correct amount of bio-electricity to their respective organs. This then controls the level of functio ning of the organ. If there is too much energy and the organ is hyperactive; too little energy and the functioning will be sluggish. Acupun cture and chi kung massage treatments restore the energy to a correct level within each organ and balance the functi oning of all organs as a collective unit. However, such replenishment of energy levels to restore organ functio n is not the limit of the ther apeutic benefits of such treatments. You can see each organ energy is also associated with other bodily systems and with an emotional response, for example, the lung energy and the emotions of grief and courage. When the lung energy is healthy one will feel brave and ready to accept life's challenges. The meridian energy is controlled by eight master meridians (the eight extra vessels) which function like energy reservoirs that feed the twelve regular meridian s. These meridians are also used in acupunctu re but not to the same extent as the twelve. Chi kung heal th restoration practices specialise in teaching the practit ioner to control the energy flow of these eight master meridian s. For detailed informati on on the eight extra meridians, see my book \"Flying without Wings\". The eight are in turn fed by the energy of the chakras . These act like transformers, converting celestial energies into bio-chemical secretions and visa versa. It is no coincidence that the chakras locations correspond to the endocrine (hormonal) glands. After all, Western science has long known of the effect of hormones on the function ing of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"the entir e human organism. The chakras are the super-conscious minds way of controlling and co-ordinating all of our systems into one cohesive unit. Various energy healing modalities use the chakra system to restore homeostasis to our physical and emotion al lives; radionics, reiki and the kahi technique from Kahun a shamanism are good examples. The idea of conserving the sexual energy found in yoga, chi kung and druidic practice, has to do with the heightening of the functions of the chakras, for when we conserve our sexual hormones the respective gland eventually becomes full. When this gland is full the body will stop expending energy to fill it and will become to fill the next gland up the ladder. When the pineal and pituitary glands are reached then, according to yogic and taoi st scripture, enlightenment is achieved. Along with enlightenment comes siddhis or extra ordinary human functions. These functions include clairvoyance, clairaudience, ESP, psychokinesis and out of body states. The final compo nent of the human bio-electrical system are the various fields of energy that surround the human body . These fields are collectively known as the aura. The aura has received a great deal of attention in modern times because illness often shows up here long before physical symptoms arise. It is for this reason that Penn State University (USA) has been developing an advanced diagnostic system by mapping the electro-magnetic flow in and around the human body. These fields consist of electro-magnetic electrodynamic convection and ultra-faint luminesc ent energies, giving us a total of seven distinct layers these seven may well be directly linked to the functions of the seven major chakras, although more research needs to be conducted in this area. Now I wish to share a simple exercise that will allow you to experience these energies first hand: Sensing chi energy with the hands Place your hands about two inches apart palms facing each other. Begin to breathe deeply and relax, after a short time of doing this you will begin to feel sensations in the hands. The usual sensations are heat, tingling, static electricity, shooting from one hand to the other or a feeling like a cool breeze blowing between the palms. Now slowly move the hands apart and imagine that the energy between"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"the hands is like pastry, stretching thin long strings between your palms. Now push the hands slowly together and feel the energy condense between them. If you don't get any immediate sensations then try again, everyone can feel this energy but the time it takes can vary quite a bit. Try to feel the energy between your hand and that of a friend, this can be an amazi ng experience. KUNDALINI: SERPENT MEDITATIONS Stretching back into the corridors of time, Asian religions have spoken of a mystical force called the Kunda lini. Throug hout history many names have been given to this power. Orgone, esprit, loosh, prana, elan vital, and bio-electricity are some of these names. The rise of the kundalini is linked with a warm liquidly magnetic energy when it rises up the spine. Physical symptoms connected to the opening of the kundalini may include crackling noises at the base of the neck, and unexplained headaches - but be careful about attributing these symbols to rising kundalini energies. Often they have a medical cause that needs the attention of a physician. Kunda lini energies are sometimes triggered by a blow to the head or other physical trauma timed by your soul to awaken your psychic journey and innate abilities. Releasing the Kundal ini energy too quickl y can have serious emotion al effects on a person. One should not attempt to open this thrust of energy if one is not in a balanced psychologically. This is not for those with manic depression or bi-polar disorder. Kunda lini literally means coiling, like a snake. Energy and consciousness - moves in spiraling motion - coils - loops - the snake. This is a metaphor for the spiraling energies of consciousness - which is our reality of thought and is explained by Sacred Geometry. The loops are the loops of time - the slinky effect - time as an illusion played out in"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"a physical game of polarities - duality emotion s. The coiled and dormant feminine energy refers to the vast potent ial of psychic energy contain ed within us all. It is normally symbolized as a serpent coiled into three and a half circles, with its tail in its mouth, and spiraling around the central axis (sacrum or sacred bone) at the base of the spine . The image of coiling, like a spring, conveys the sense of untapped potential energy that will spring into action soon. For now we remember in small doses. Kunda lini can be described as a great reservoir of creative energy at the base of the spine. It's not useful to sit with our consciousness fixed in our head and think of kundalini as a foreign force running up and down our spine. This meditation is for the extremely advanced. All seven chakras must be completely open and active. Any blockages in your seven chakras can cause very serious physical and emotional damage when raising the kundalini. The results could be permanent, or even fatal! If the serpent reaches a blockage in a certain chakra, it will most often go off course to find another way around it. This can result in physical damage, and could cause a massive stroke or aneurysm. Thes e warnings are not to be taken lightly. Someone wanting to do Kundalini Yoga is probably better off not doing or trying it. It is a lot better if one can begin to recognize what might already be Kundalini acting within the body and learn to flow more easily with what is happening or recognize blocks in their flow (chakra blocks), rather than try to make or force something. Awakening the Kunda lini in the wrong state, or in the wrong way (with blocks, chakra blocks), can and often does result in severe damage to the person trying to do this. No writing on Kundal ini would be complete or valuable unless it specified this clearly. A person can very easily end up with a malignant or enfeebling disease or be rendered comatose by making attempts to awaken the Kundalini. In terms of what Kundalini is in the body, one might consider it very much like a \"perpetual motion battery\" of sorts, though please do not think I am talking about an actual battery. Not at all. This is an energy, and you will not be able to \"see\" it inside the physiology of the body, like in an x-ray or any such thing. It is like a source of prolific and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"immense power that is latent, or not fully active, but which releases very small amounts of this energy constantly (it is what enables you to move and be animated). You can think of it like the two poles, positive and negative, and the farther they get away from each other the more energy can pass between them and be accessible. Slight awakenings or stirrings of Kundal ini can be likened to the poles being slightly pulled apart and then put back again. A \"thrill\" or sudden burst of energy. Needless to say, if a person is not prep ared for the release of a greater amount of this energy and the allegorical poles happen to be pulled too widely apart, or too suddenly, incredibly dangerous things can happen. As far as \"doing\" Kundal ini Yoga, it is not recommended. It is often something that occurs naturally through advancing in meditation. Many individuals whose Kundalini has been prematurel y unleashed do not know what is happen ing, and the prevailing social ignorance about this multidimensional transformative process makes it hard to find medical or alternative health practitioners or spiritual advisors who recognize the symptoms, particularly when they are strongly physical. Many people know that the risen Kunda lini flings open gates to all sorts of mystical, paranormal, and magical vistas... but few realize it can also dramatically impact the body. A large percentage of people reported long bouts of strange illness as well as radical mental, emotional, interpersonal, psychic, spiritual and lifestyle changes.Over and again we hear stories of frustrating, sometimes desperate visits to doctors, healers, counselors, and others who neither understood, nor were able to help with the myriad pains and problems catalyzed by raging Kunda lini. Logos (Kundalini) was considered to be rooted in the Waters of Life (The Bahu in Hebrew, Demiurge in Greek); it's your own physical Root inside of you, and the shooting upward of this force was known as Logos. The \"Water s\" are the Root of the Tree of Life - \"the Waters\" is the same word in our BAPHE (Baphe Metis) or the Babylonian BAHU MID. Bahu is the word in Hebrew, too. Same word. Does it have a meaning now? YES! How can anyone become klippoth? Easy: hold it back, for ce the serpent down backwards - down the tree of death. In doctrines that makes a person ophionic - or in spiritual terms, O phion, also known as Leviathan, or The Beast Chiva. This comes into a person to rip that Logos out, and bring it back to the voidness where it belongs. People that experience this are left like empty husks (klippoth). This creates in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"that person a very awful state of being. You become as the living dead.

They will never be able to know the \"good/evil\" that is them, their core selves. They will never be able to see the \"Beast Ophion \" that they call into themselves, or ever understand why they do it. They are like broken people with no core self at all, no inner ordering principle, no innocence, no logic. They flee from the truth of self, or anything that can get them to see it. Every time, without fail - even if they at first insist that they want to know this so that they can \"get over\" whatever \"bullshit on the brain\" they have that makes them so unable to use logic in their lives, they flee in the end. This can also happen to people who try to raise the kundalini prematurely. That is why it is important for one to become adva nced before attempting this. Any chakra blockages at all could cause you to become like this. If you destroy any of your chakra s, you will be completely helpless. Never try to force this energy down. On another note, always light and spin your chakras in the correct order, from the root to the top, never in reverse. This can also be dangerous.

The startling thing found when one searches for decent shielding methods is that one encounters shields that either appeal to one deity or anothe r or rely on the basic \"goodness\" of the individual for efficacy. Firstly, define \"shield\". My arcane and trustworthy Webster's states that a shield is \"any person or thing that guards, protects, etc.\" Note that it does not necessarily oppose or confront any energies directed against one. It merely protects one from those energies. To protect one, a shield may effect one of three areas; 1.) the attacking force (opposition) 2.) the defend ing object (evasion) 3.) the intervening space between force and object (interposition) To oppose a force effectively, one must use a force of equal or superior energy, potent ial or kinetic.(That is, energy that is at rest or in motion.) This is the most risky of all shields as one never knows if one is being attacked by a single person or a group or how large the group may be or how strong the attacker is. No matter how strong you are, there is someone somewhere stronger. Thus an opposing shield can be smashed or the shielder can be worn down, as in a siege, until he drops the shield in exhaustion. To evade a force is very good if one is capable of it. However, magickal force makes no distinctions between \"here\" and \"there\" so physical distance or location is no evasion at all. Astral evasion is only effective against the most elementary attacks such as the science-fiction/fantasy inspired \"magical bolt\". Effective evasion, while the finest magickal defens e I have ever come across, is not easily available to the student, for it involves removing oneself from the attacker's world. One must become completely aware of the reality that projects outward from one by Will."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Familiar s are often used as interpositional shields, taking the blow for their magickian-owners. This can get expensive and demoralizing when attacks take place as the Familiar often cannot live through the experience. Abstract shields, experience has shown, are more durab le and more easily strengthened or recharged. They have the added feature of being non-living and thus less messy. A good visual conception of mathematics can lead to a fine shield that borders on evasion but allows a \"bubble\" of ego-inhabit ed universe to exist. Language problems again. This shield is based on the concept of an unreachable mathematical limit. Visualize this concept of limit within the shell of a hollow sphere around oneself. Imagine the shell as being one inch thick (an example, any thickness will do) with an infinite limit fro m the outside edge to the inside edge. No force or thought form can ever make it through that shield. Instead it will find itself traveling forever to cover one inch of shield. To build this shield with a minimum of figure-flipping, visualize infinite Space and begin with expanding your aura field. Project out large vertical rings of electromagnetic force, or intelligence, to compr ess the concept of space to an inch thick hollow sphere of predetermine d size surrounding you. Recharge as often as your confidence in it wanes. The shields described here have the advantage of not particularly needing ritualistic construction or formalized rigid symbolo gy.

It will start moving faster until it becomes a milky white color. Some peop le can hear the field when it starts to move faster. Now, take another breath and beginnin g with the root chakra, light your chakras up in order. Inhale deeply. On this exhale you should see the chakra colors streaming out from your body to the aura field. Begin to spin all of them. Remember you have room to imagine yourself floating around inside your aura field. I sit in an office chair with wheels so I spin around inside (yeah I have fun!). Getting your chakra lights to hit the sides of your aura seems like a nice way of patchin g holes and cracks. Now say \"speed of light\" to the chakras. At this point your chakra lights will bounce and reflect from the sides of your aura. You will find yourself sitting in a pure white mist. This is quite peaceful and anything goes here. I was able to open my hand and feet chakra s with this meditation. If you do this meditation for extended times over many days, you might notice some energy changes in the meditation itself. It will be different for each person, as experience is subjective. Basically you may add variations to what happen s once everything goes white. This is normal. You are sitting in pure energy.

Chakra 1 The following three hatha yoga exercises work on stimulating and releasing energy from the Muladhara chakra itself: Locus t & Half Locus t: Lie face down on the floor with your arms beneath your body, hands touching the front of your thighs. Keeping the knee straight, raise the leg several inches off the floor. Hold for as long as comfortable and switch to the left leg. If this is comfortable then repeat the same procedure lifting both legs at once. Head To Knee Pose: Lie down on your back and relax. When ready, stretch your arms over your head, take a deep breath and raise yourself to a seated position, keeping your legs straight out in front of you. Bend the right leg and tuck the left foot into your crotch. Bend over, arms outstretched, reaching out over the left leg. Do not go farther than is comfortable, but go as far as you can. Try to find the threshold between where the tension begins and breath into that spot while you hold the posture. Hold for one to two minutes, return to a seated position, and straighten your right leg, bendin g your left, and repeat. After returning to the position of lying flat on your back (corpse pose) for a brief rest, repeat the same procedure as above, bending over both legs. Be gentle, and tension will ease more quickly. Deep Relaxation: This is also called conscious relaxation. It involves grounding and relaxing each part of the body, one at a time. Lie flat on your back, and"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"begin by taking several deep, abdomo nal breaths. Beginning at the toes, work up your body, moving towards to heart, and consciously release tension in each and every muscle and joint in your body. Be sure to include the eyes, mouth and throat, as much tension is subconsciously held here. Observe your thoughts letting them come and go effortlessly. Allow yourself to obse rve your body, peacefully breathing in and out, in and out, deeply relaxing. When you are ready, begin flexing your fingers and toes, and wiggling your arms and legs. Open your eyes and return to the world refreshed Chakra 2 Exercise for openin g the second chakra involves working with movement in the hips and lower abdomen. Simple self-nurtur ing activity, such as long, hot baths, showers or swimming should not be overlooked. The Goddess Pose Lie flat on your back and relax. Relax especially the legs, pelvis, and lower back. Bend your knees, bringing your feet in close to your buttocks. Slowly allow your knees to part, allowing the weight of the legs to stretch the inne r thighs. Try to relax. Do not push your legs farther than is comfortable. Hold this position for two minutes or more. Then slowly bring your knees together again. Pelvic Rock Starting on your back w ith legs bent, slowly begin to rock your pelvis upward and downward with each breath. Inhale fully into your chest and belly, exhale fully, and upon the end of each exhale, push slightly with your feet so that your pelvis comes off the ground pushin g the small of your back into the floor beneath you. Hip Circles From a standing position, bend your knees slightly, and drop your pelvis forward so that it is directly in your central line of gravity. Keeping the knees bent and flexible, rotate the pelvis in smaller then larger circles. The head and feet should remain in the same place while the pelvis alone does the moving. Try to make the movement as smooth as possible. Leg Lifts"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"This exercise helps move energy through the pelvis, often into the upper chakras. It is a classic Kundalini exercise, and a wonderful energizer. Lie on your back and relax. Lift your legs six to 12 inches off the floor and spread them apart at this height. Bring together again and then kick our again. Rest after about five of these. Then bring your legs perpendicular to the floor and spread to each side. Bring together and down. Repeat until tired. Raising legs should be accompanie d by an inhale, while lowering the legs should be accompani ed by an exhale. Triangle Benefits: legs, hips, shoulders, neck, sides of trun k and overall sense of balance. Contraindications: back conditions 1. Spread feet at 1,5 shoulder width. Keep feet parallel. At the same time spread hands at shoulder level and maintain stretch from shoulder to fingers, or better yet, from fingers to fingers. 2. Turn right foot 90 degrees to the right. Keep left hip open at all times. Pull kneecaps up and keep the legs strong. 3. Exhaling slightly bend right knee and put right elbow above right knee. Project left arm towards the ceiling. 4. Look up. Trunk shou ld feel live, so avoid too much weight in right hand. Stay here for a few breaths, with inhalation come up to the starting position and repeat to the other side. Repeat 3 times each side. Follow the position if it gets deeper, until you place fingers or palm on the ground. Trikonasana - Triangle Follow the instr uctions for preparation. Only difference is front knee which stays straight all the time. Pay extra attention to rear hip, keep openin g it while in posture.

Inhale, look to your right, turn the whole trunk and extend the spine upwards. 4. Exhaling and keeping the knee close to armpit, look over your right shoulder. Don’t engage just the neck, torsion should be felt throughout the whole spine. Repeat to the other side. Chakra 3 Breath of Fire: This is a rapid diaphragmatic breathing, designed to clean toxins from the body and stimulate Kundal ini. Sit in an upright posture with back straight and legs relaxed. Using the muscles of your abdome n, SNAP in your diaphragm, cau sing a quick exhale to escape through your nose. Keep the mouth closed. By relaxing the abdomen, air will naturally enter your nose and chest, causing an inhale. When this process is comfortable, repeat quickly, causing several quick, sequential exhales. Do in sets of fifty, with a long, deep breath at the end of each set. Three sets of 50 are usually a good place to start. After a while you can pace yourself according to what feels right. Bow Pose Lie on your stomach, hands to the side and relax. Take a deep breath and bend your knees while arching your back so that your hands grab onto your ankles. Let your hands do the work of maintaining the arch while you rest your body as much as you can in this strange position. Breathe deeply and let the breath rock you back and forth slightly.

It requires a certain loss of ego, allowing an ability to merge with things outside of the self. And lastly, it requires an understanding and control of the breath, for it is the tool of physical and mental transformation. Unfortunately, the average person does not breathe very deeply. A normal pair of lungs can hold about 2 pints of air, while the average person breathes in about 1 pint or less per breath. Unlike food, which takes hours or even days to digest, each inhalation of air immediately enters the blood stream. Oxygen must be constantly supplied to each and every cell, or the cells die quickly. Following are a few basic exercises in complete breathing and opening the chest. Alternate Nostril Breathing This is a slow, methodical breath which works on the central nervous system and leads to increased relaxation and deeper sleep. Close off your right nostril with your right hand and breathe in deeply through your left nostril. When the breath is full, close off your left nostril, hold the breath for 8 seconds, and then exhale through your right. When the breath is again empty, inhale again through your right side, hold, and then exhale on the left. The pattern is inhale, (hold) switch, exhale, inhale, (hold) switch, exhale. Continue this 10 times or more on each side. Practice of this exercise will generally bring profound changes in as short a time as a week, or even days. The Cobra This is a yogic exercise, wonderful to do upon first waking up in the morning. It works on the upper thoracic vertebrae, and helps alleviate \"hunchba ck\". Lie flat on your stomach with arms bent and palms placed face down by your ears. Without using your arms as suppor t, slowly lift your head, shoulders, and back-as far as you can go comforta bly. Then relax. Lift again, going as far as you can, and then using your arms, push yourself up just a little farther. Stretch the stomach and chest, take a deep breath and relax. Repeat as often as you like. The Fish"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"This is another yogic exercise, designed to expand the chest cavity. Begin by lying flat on your back. The n come to a half seated position and prop yourself up on your elbows, hands on hips. Now extend your head back behind you and arch your back. If you can, touch your head to the floor and breathe deeply. Hold as long as is comfort able and relax. Breath deeply again. Chakra 5 The Shoul der Stand The shoulder stand stimulates the thyroid gland. Lie flat on your back and relax. Lift your legs 90 degrees from the floor, and then bring your legs and hips up over the shoulders, suppor ting yourself on your elbows-hands on your hips. Hold for as long as is comfortable. This also helps to turn around a descending current of energy by making gravity pull in the opposite direction from our normal upright state. The Fish Pose The fish pose often follows the shoulder stand as it gives the neck a compleme ntary stretch. Lie flat on your back. With hands on hips, prop your upper body up on your elbows, arching your neck backward until your head touches the floor. This also helps open the chest cavity and stimula tes the thyroid. The Plou gh The plough involves returning to a shoulder stand. Then lower your legs behind your head, touching your feet to the ground. If this is still comforta ble, bend your knees and tuck them behind your ears. Chakra 6 The most useful exercise for strengthening the third eye is simple meditation, focusing attenti on on the centre of the forehead. Visualizations of colors or shapes can be added or you can simply focus on clearing the mind screen until it is clean and blank. The limits of this system are only the limits of your imagination.

As with any meditation, you may wish to play music if it helps you to relax. 1st stage: 45 minutes Stand with feet as wide apart as your hips or shoulders. Let your body be loose and relaxed. Close your eyes and with mouth open breathe deeply and rapidly into the first chakra. As you breathe let your attention be in the pelvic area of your body, where the first chakra is located. Equal emphasis should be put on both the in and out breaths. Don't force your breathing: breathe in a rhythm that feels comfortable and allows you to become aware of the feelings and sensations of each chakra. Breathe into the first chakra. Release each breath through the top of your head. After 5 minutes, move this deep rapid breathing up into the next chakra; the third, then the fourth, fifth, sixth and, the seventh chakra. You should spend 5 minutes on each major chakra. As you breathe up from chakra to chakra, your breathing should become more rapid and more gentle so that you are taking about twice as many breaths in the seventh chakra as you were in the first. While breathing, it is helpful to shake your body, stretch, tilt, or rotate your pelvis and move your hands in any way that you feel, but let your feet stay in one spot. After breathing in the seventh chakra, let your breath and awareness turn and fall back down throug h each chakra . . . allowing your breath to become slower and slower. This downward breathing should take about two minutes, and it is up to you how long you breathe into each chakra. After you finish this sequence, stand silently for a few moments before starting the next sequence. This upward and downward breathing sequence should be repeated three times, for a total of about 45"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"minutes. 2nd stage: 15 minutes Just sitting. After the third breathing sequence, sit with closed eyes in silence for at least 15 minutes or longer if you wish. As you sit don't focus on anything in particular. Allow yourself to become aware of and watch whatever is happen ing within. Remember, for doing any meditation feel relaxed, remain a witness to whatever is happening and don't judge it. SPINNING CHAKRAS Focus on each chakra one by one starting with the root and moving up. Color each one accordingly and spin it for ten revolutions. Complet e one chakra before moving on to the next. If it moves smoothl y and easily in a complet e circle, a few repetitions will be enough. If it seems to be stuck o r moving with resistance, or if it seems to move in a lopsided circle, if the color fades, or begins to move counter clockwise, you need to spend more time and focus on this chakra. These are symptoms of a chakra block. SPINNING VORTICE MEDITATION Lay on your back a nd imagine that your chakras are clocks with the face pointing upward. Twelve o’clock is toward your head, and six o’clock is toward your feet. Spin your chakras clockwise to the left. Imagine each chakra vortice like a funnel, larger at the body surface and getting smaller as it approaches your spine.

Many are afraid that they may die, or be harmed in some way as a result of their projection. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Cantebury Institute, renowned for its occult studies, executed an experiment in projection involving over 2,000 people. None of them were hurt in any way by this, and now, three years later, none have complained of any newly arising problems. Once you are aware that you cannot be harmed by projecting, you should begin Monroe 's techniques, step by step. Step one: Relax the body. According to Monroe , \"the ability to relax is the first prerequisite, perhaps even the first step itself\" to having an OBE. (out of body experience) This includes both physical and me ntal relaxation. Monroe does not suggest a method of attaining this relaxation, although Progressive Muscle relaxation, coupled with deep breathing exercises (inhale 1, exhale 2, inhale 3.... until 50 or 100) are known to work well. Step two: Enter the state bordering sleep. This is known as the hypnagogic state. Once again, Monro e doesn't recommend any method of doing this. One way is to hold your forearm up, while keeping your upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you start to fall asleep, your arm will fall, and you will awaken again. With practice, you can learn to control the Hypnagogic state without using your arm. Another method is to concentrate on an object. When other images start to enter your thoughts , you have entered the Hypnagogic state."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Passively watch these images. This will also help you maintain the state of near-sleep. Monroe calls this Condition A. Step three: Deepen this state. Begin to clear your mind. Obse rve your field of vision through your closed eyes. Do nothin g more for a while. Simply look through your closed eyelids at the blackness in front of you. After awhile, you may notice light patterns. These are simply neural discharges. They have no specific effect. Ignore them. When they cease, one has entered what Monroe calls Condition B. From here, one must enter an even deeper state of relaxation which Monroe calls Condition C-- a state of such relaxation that you lose all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation. You are almost in a void in which your only source of stimulation will be your own thoughts. The ideal state for leaving your body is Condition C. This is when it is voluntarily induced from a rested and refreshed condition and is not the effect of normal fatigue. To achieve Condition C, Monroe suggests that you practice entering it in the morning or after a short nap. Step Four: Enter a state of Vibration. This is the most important part of the techniqu e, and also the most vague. Many projectors have noted these vibrations at the onset of projection. They can be experienced as a mild tingling, or as is electricity is being shot through the body. Their cause is a mystery. It may actually be the astral body trying to leave the physical one. For entering into the vibrational state, he offers the following directions: 1. Remove all jewelry or other items that might be touching your skin. 2. Darken the room so that no light can be seen throug h your eyelids, but do not shut out all light. 3. Lie down with your body along a north-south axis, with your head pointed toward magnetic north."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"4. Loosen all clothing, but ke ep covered so that you are slightly warmer than might normally be comfortable. 5. Be sure you are in a location where, and at a time when, there will be absolutely no nois e to disturb you. 6. Enter a state of relaxation. 7. Give yourself the mental suggestion that you will remember all that occurs during the upcoming session that will be beneficial to your well- being. Repeat this five times. 8. Proceed to breath through your half-open mouth. 9. As you breathe, concentrate on the void in front of you. 10. Select a point a foot away from your forehead, and then change your point of mental reference to six feet. 11. Turn the point 90 degrees upward by drawing an imaginary line parallel to your body axis up and abov e your head. Focus there and reach out for the vibrations at that point and bring them back into your body. Even if you don't know what these vibrations are, you will know when you have achieved contact with them. Step five: Learn to control the vibrational state. Practice controlling them by mentally pushin g them into your head, down to your toes, making them surge through out your entire body, and produc ing vibrational waves from head to foot. To produce this wave effect, concentrate of the vibrations and me ntally push a wave out of your head and guide it down your body. Practice this until you can induce these waves on command. Once you have control of the vibrational state, you are ready to leave the body. Step six: Begin with a partial separation. The key here is thought control. Keep your mind firmly focused on the idea of leaving the body. Do not let it wander. Stray thought might cause you to lose control of the state. Now, having entered the vibrational state, begin exploring the OBE by"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"releasing a hand or a foot of the \"second body\". Monroe suggests that you extend a limb until it comes in cont act with a familiar object, such as a wall near your bed. Then push it through the object. Return the limb by placing it back into coincidence with the physical one, decrease the vibrational rate, and then termina te the experiment. Lie quietly until you have fully returned to normal. This exercise will prepare you for full separation. Step seven: Dissociate yourself from the body. Monroe suggests two methods for this. One method is to lift out of the body. To do this, think about getting lighter and lighter after entering this vibrational state. Think about how nice it would be to float upward. Keep this thought in mind at all costs and let no extraneous thoughts interrupt it. An OBE will occur naturally at this point. Another method is the \"Rotation method\" or \"roll-out\" technique. When you have achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over as if you were turning over in bed. Do not atte mpt to roll over physically. Try to twist your body from the top and virtually roll over into your second body right out of your physical self. At this point, you will be out of the body but next to it. Think of floating upward, and you should find yourself floating above the body. Monroe suggests you begin with the lift-out method, but argu es that both are equally efficacious. If, after all this, you still can't project, I recommend purchasing Leaving The Body, by R. Scott Rogo. It contains another eight or so techniqu es. Mind Control Method Clear all your thought s, In your mind say: \"I'm going to count down from 3 to 1, visualizing each number on a white orb suspended in the air above my head. When I reach the third and final \"1\" my body will be deeply relaxed. I will have no awareness"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"of physical sensations. I will not perceive any physical discomfort. My consciousness will be focused on my astral body. Now visualize a white orb suspend ed in the air above your head. Mentally focus on the orb I visualize a number \"3\" on the face of the orb. The numbers can be any color. They may vary with each experience. Visualize the 3 --three times: three number, \"3's\" on the orb. Your body is completely relaxed. You are losing awareness of your physical body. Then repeat the visualization with three number, \"2's.\" You are into greater relaxation. Now visualize the \"1's.\" You are losing awareness of physical sensations. Your consciousness will be in your astral body. Repeat this using the number \"1's\" three times. Your consciousness is now in my astral body. This could involve training of several sessions. You may also find audiotapes that take you down into these altered states as well. You will get better and faster as you go along each time. There is no set agenda for how often you practice astral projection or any other out-of-body techniqu e. It soon becomes fun. It is like a deep meditation. Now the key is to remain conscious while my body is asleep. Different thought s may pull you from your focus as the mind loves to chatter. Just push these thought s away. SILENT MIND POWERFUL MIND Concentration on the Breath What is not generally known is that a concentrated mind succeeds not only because it can solve problems with greater dispatch, but also because problems have a way of somehow vanishing before its focused energies, without even requiring to be solved. A concentrated mind often attracts opportunities for success that, to less focused (and therefore less successful) individuals, appear to come by sheer luck. A person whose mind is concentrated receives inspirations in his work and in his thinking that, to duller minds, may often seem the proof of special divine favor. Yet such seeming \"favors\" are due simply to the power of concentration. Concentration awakens our powers and channels them, dissolving obstacles in our path, literally attracting opportunities, insights, and insp irations. What is concentration? Concentration implies, first, an ability to"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"release one's mental and emotion al energies from all other interests and involvements, and second, an ability to focus them on a single object or state of awareness. Concentration may assume var ious manifestations, from a dynamic outpour ing of energy to perfectly quiescent perceptions. In its higher stages, concentration becomes so deep that there is no longer any question of its remaining merely a practice: The student becomes so complete ly identified with the object of his concentration that he and it, as well as the act of concentration itself, become one. In this way he can even, temporarily, become one with something external to himself, gaining thereby a far deeper unders tanding of it than would be possible by aloof scientific objectivity, that pride of Western heritage which has the disa dvantage of setting man apart from nature, not in harmony with it. But in concentration on our own higher realities, identification with them becomes lasting. Obviously, then, the most effective technique of concentration will be one which both interiorizes the mind, and permits a gradual transition from technical practice to utter stillness. The technique of watching the breath fulfills both of these requirements--better, perhaps, than any other technique possibly could. For not only is the breath one of the most natural focal points for the attention, but, as we shall see, the more deeply one concentrates on it, the more refined it becomes, until breathing is automatic ally and effortlessly suspended in breathlessness: Meditator, the act of concentration, and the object of concentration become one. In the state of breathlessness, more over, the senses themselves become automatically stilled, permitting an undistur bed continuation of the concentrated state. Once the mind is so perfectly focused, its concentrated power may be applied to any object one wishes. But because attentiveness to the breath involves the will in an act, not of doing, but of inward becoming (by concentration on the breath one acquires the consciousness of being air, or infinite space), the natural direction of the mind in this technique is toward superconsciousness. (If the will is not involved at all, the mind tends to slip downward into subconsciousness.) A restless mind may be distracted by many things. In this condition, it may be necessary for one to command its attention forcefully--by yoga postures, perhaps, and loud chantin g. But once the mind begins to grow still, the greatest obstacle to its becoming more so is the breath. By"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"concentration on the breath, mental fixity is attained. Only in breathlessness can Godhead be fully realized. The breath responds instantly to different mental and emotional states. Even the way in which it flows in the nostrils indicates one's state of consciousness. The reverse also is true: As the breath flows, so flows the mind. Heavy breathing can make the mind restless. Calm breathing calms the mind. By concentration on the breath, too, the mind becomes calmer. This greater calmness is reflected in increasingly gentle breathing, which in turn induces still deeper concentration and calmness, a process that continues until mind and breathing both achieve perfect stillness. It is possible to remain breathless for long periods of time without in any way damaging the body or the brain. (Indeed, the rejuvenating effects on the entire being of superconscious breathlessness are truly wonderful.) When the yogi attains breathlessness in samadhi, the body is kept alive by the direct flow of energy from the medulla oblongata. It is possible in this state to remain breathless for days, months, even for years. The body appears lifeless, outwardly, but inwardly one is filled with the consciousness of infinite life. Periods of breathlessness may come to you, while practicing... Don't be alarmed; they can't possibly hurt you, as long as you let the breath flow naturally, and don't try to hold it in or out of the lungs by force. When your body needs to breathe again, it will do so. By increasingly deeper calmness, however, you will find that you need less and less fresh air to sustain your body. Relaxation A Relaxation Techn ique for the Body The best way to relax the body is to tense it first, and thereby to equalize the flow of tension all over the body. Then, with relaxation, you will find tensions being released that you didn't even know existed. Inhale, tense the whole body, then throw the breath out and relax. Doing this three to six times will help rid the body of uncon scious tensions. Now, consciously relax the various body parts, starting with your feet and working your way gradually to the head and brain. It may help you to visualize space or light filling each area as you relax it. Physical relaxation is the first step necessary for deep meditation."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Regular Breathing to Relax the Mind The breath is intimatel y linked with the mind. By controlling and relaxing the breath, we influence the mind to become calm. Inhal e slowly counting one to twelve, hold your breath for the same number of counts, then exhale for the same count. This is one round of \"regular breathing.\" Do six to nine rounds. Your may either lengthen or shorten the number of counts according to what is comfortable, but ke ep the inhalation, retention and exhalation equal. Releasing Emotional Tension This practice can also help us to achieve release from mental and emotional pain. The stress that accompanie s such pain usually produces physical tension. By relaxing the body, as outlined above, then extending the thought of physical relaxation to the release of tension in the mind and in the emotion s, we can achieve mental and emotional tranquility with the release of tension in the body. Whenever you feel anxious or fearful about anything, or distressed over the way someone has treated you, or upset for any reason, inhale and tense the body. Bring your emotions to a focus in the body with that act of tension. Hold the tension briefly, vibrating your emotions along with the body. Throw the breath out, and, keeping the breath exhaled as long as you can do so comfortably, enjoy the feeling of peace. Remain for a time without thought. When the breath returns, or when thoughts once again stir themselves in your mind, fill your brain with some happy memory that will provide an antidote to your emotions. Concentrate for several minutes on the happin ess of that memory. ENHANCING YOUR ABILITIE S By Brenda Mintie © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients Unless you have already begun to experience psychic abilities such as clairvoyance and clairaudience, you may wonder how to achieve the necessary skills to communicate with other beings in the 4th dimension. We have constructed a meditation to help you enhance the abilities of clairvoyance, clairaudience, and to help strengthen your skills in"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"visualization. Visualization itself is mandatory in successful magick and light meditations. Imagination and perception are the keys to opening the doors of magick on the astral. For beginners, this meditation should be done at least 15 to 30 minutes a day. 1. Begin this meditation by clearing your mind. Start breathing. Breathe in, hold your breath countin g down from ten to zero. Repeat this operation for 10 to 20 times, or until you feel completely relaxed. 2. Try to void out any voices in your head. With your eyes closed, try to picture yourself in a comfort able surrounding. This may be a forest, a beach, a desert, or even another planet. There is no wrong choice of environment. Take the time to look around and get comfortab le with your surroundings. There is no limitation. You can go above or below to reach the different planes of your imagination. You can think of it as dreaming awake, but in this setting you have complete control. You may even create an inner sanctuary to return for future meditations. 3. Still continuing to breathe and relax, you may now begin to explore this world. Think of it as turning your 3rd eye inside of yourself to explore the worlds within You will find other life inside of these imaginary worlds. The people, and even the anima ls in which you encounter will have a voice to speak. Some of these may be forms of your own higher conciousness. Some may no t. You do not have to know the diffe rence immediately. Right now, it is important for you to keep a still mind so that you can tell the difference between your own thought s, and the messages from a higher source. Ask it what information or advice that it may have to offer you. Is this your inner guide? 4. If you encoun ter anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, ask it to kindly come to you in another form. If it does not agree, this may be an outsider. For self defens e, focus hot white light on any negative entity that you encounter. This will destroy and repel a smaller nuisance. If the white light doesn't work, give it a warning. If it persists, or begins to cause any pain or odd sensations like it may be touching you, call out to a god or goddess for assistance. Thoug h seldom in occurance, this has been known to happen. Do not go around attacking anything without reason. The same rules apply in the universal code of conduct. 5. After you begin to advance, and clearly visualize while hearing voices without interruption of your own thought processes, you may thank your inner guide and bid him/her farewell. This was probably only a"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"form of highe r conciousness. Gods, goddesses, angels, and many spirits have the ability to create visions and appear in this world. The visions are received by your 3rd eye in the center of your forehead. Their voices may be picked up by the side chakras of your head. It is not uncommon to eventually be able to see and hear the gods by a similar method. Eventually you will be able to accomplish this with your eyes wide open. This takes time and practice. Once you start advancing, you can use this inner sanctuary as a place for meeting gods. This is an optional method for those of you who are less advanced. ENERGY CIRCULATION By Brenda Mintie © 2005 Te mple of the Ancients Use this meditation when you are ill or when you absolutely cannot manage the longer meditations for some reason. This meditation does not replace the lengthier work; it merely maintains your energies and rejuvenates your energy centers. You are not adding any additional power to what you already have. All you will be doing is circulating it from one place to another with the breath and the mind. I have found that by doing this simple meditation, it not only cleans the aura, it charges the chakra centers and prov ides much needed rejuvenation to those of us who are sick or tired. **Note: Don't try this right before you want to go to sleep. It will keep you awake. Lay down in a comfortable position. Tighten all your muscles at once, then release them all at once. Feel yourself notice the difference in this relaxed state. *Understand how to control light with the breath. Inhaling at different points in this exercise will pull light, whereas exhaling (or blowing) will expand light. You will breathe in with the nose, out through the mouth. Take a few deep cleansing breaths. Expand your aura out from your body by inhaling and blowing out several times. See this as a clear bubble that will move out fro m your"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"body. You are inside of this. Inhale/exhale and see a globe of light blue/white light at your crown. Inhale/exhale and let this globe pour a founta in of light over you in sparks. Leave that globe at the crown. Move to the next chakra (third eye) and do the same thing. Do each chakra exactly the same. When you reach the root, then move to the feet and form a globe. At this point you should have globes of light at all the chakras and at your feet, with a huge founta in going. Stop the fountain but leave the globes. Now you are going to do some power inhaling and draw a thick bar of light from the feet to connect all of the glob es, all the way up to the crown. Inhaling controls this. Just pull that light up by inhaling deeply and exhaling. When you've reached the crown, make this connected light form a barrier around you. Inhale, blow out and connect it to your aura. Open your eyes and inhale to bring your aura back to you. You are finished! This meditation takes 3 minutes, depend ing on your power of visualization."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"SIGILS, SYMBOLS AND SIGNATURES © 2005 Daniel F else I st il l h a ve mo r e si g i l s to cr ea te .
