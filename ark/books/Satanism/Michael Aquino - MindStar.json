Eliot1 [index_split_003.html#p15]What is conscious existence? As humans experienceit, what is its significance to them? And does it have aconsequence?These questions are not only at the core of humanintrospection, but dictate both individual and groupbeliefs concerning reality. Such beliefs in turn bothencourage and constrain behavior. If, for instance, youregard your incarnated physical life as the completeextent of your existence, you will tend to conduct yourselfmuch differently than an immortal being onlytemporarily linked to a physical body.Closely related to this problem is the question ofpurpose: Do humans have one, and if so, whence comes1 MindStar was written by a dead man, in that I came extremely closeto physical death from cancer during 2015. That lent a specialmotivation and urgency to creating this book, in disregard of painand exhaustion, in order to make its contents available to suitablereaders within this physical environment. Had it been written by aliving man, it might not have been tongued with fire.- 16 -it? Assumptions concerning this also channel thoughts,statements, and actions of both individuals and groups.Indeed so fundamental are these two issues that allelse can be seen as mere footnotes to them. Physicalscience focuses on discovering and deciphering themachinery of the Objective Universe (OU), and takesgreat pride in its [insistently-claimed] objectivity in doingso. And yet all such knowledge of external mechanisms is,in the final analysis, pointless unless related and relevantto conscious experience of it. If someone is not there toapprehend and appreciate it, the entire OU can emerge,exist, and exmerge as mere happenstance. If it is not ofinterest to some perspective consciousness, it is irrelevantwhether it exists or not. [My efforts to write this book arewasted, and the book itself inconsequential unless youread, understand, and apply it.]My companion book MindWar includes anexamination of what I term “thought architecture”.Humans are normally both ignorant of and unconcernedwith how their thoughts originate and are structured.They “just think”, and that is all there is to it.But that is not all there is to it. The interface betweenthe consciousness (alternately “the mind”) and thephysical senses (body mechanisms receiving disturbancesfrom and changes within the OU) is the brain: anelectromagnetic/chemical machine which processes rawsensory inputs into either predetermined/recognizedpatterns or new experiences modifying existing patternsor forming the bases of new ones. Overwhelmingly -about 95% of the time - this is a passive process occurringin the subconscious. 2An additional 5% rises to the attention ofconsciousness to require active consideration:2 Cf. Leonard Mlodinow, Ph.D., Subliminal: How Your UnconsciousMind Rules Your Behavior (New York: Pantheon, 2012).- 17 -algorithmic thought. This results in deliberatedecision-making, and also in assignment of the input toan existing or new pattern into which it did not fitautomatically/subconsciously.MindWar is a manual for practical applications in theOU, so concentrates on the identification and control ofpattern and algorithmic thought. It is thus a book about,and a concept of [OU] science.There is, however, a third element of thoughtarchitecture, only briefly mentioned in MindWar for thesake of thoroughness: conceptual thought. Also called“creative” or “divine”, this identifies thinking which is notthe product of OU externalities and the brain’s sorting,recognizing, and classifying mechanisms. It comes intoexistence in pure uniqueness: what Plato termed nœsis,or “enlightened intuition”. It is not a construct of the OU;rather it generates its own “subjective” universe (SU). Aseach such thought is discrete, an individual experiencingsuch will apprehend consequently numerous/uniqueSUs, all of which, in varying degrees of arbitraryimportance, coalesce into a comprehensive SU (CSU).In addition to serving as the “mirror” of theindividual’s existence and unique identity, the CSU alsofunctions as an inexorable and inescapable filter throughwhich interactions with the OU must pass. If input fromthe OU is not intelligible to the CSU, it is simplydisregarded [if it is detected at all] as “noise”. 3Humans are most commonly familiar with thisphenomenon as “not wanting to hear” or “tuning out”3 The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) ranges from a theoretical“long wave” the length of the OU to short, high-frequency waves afraction of the size of an atom. While the extremes of the EMS aretheoretically infinite, for practical scientific measurement the rangeextends from 0 Hz (hertz = cycles per second) to 10 picometers (apicometer being a trillionth of a meter). Within this vast range of EMradiation (EMR), the conscious human senses can detect only thetiny ranges of visible light, heat, and audible sound.- 18 -information in conflict with their accustomed CSUs.Particularly entrenched and rigidified instances are oftencalled “sacred cows”, and on a more comprehensive scale,“religions”.The academic and scientific community prides itselfon existing intellectually only within the OU, indeed tothe extent of rejecting any SU as an inconvenient andannoying obstacle of “irrationality” to be overcome,ridiculed, and ignored. Nevertheless such puritans havedone nothing more than substitute an established-consensus SU to override individual ones. This becomes“accepted” science [or as disciples would prefer to say,“reality”]. Evolution through further OU investigation isslowed, and occasionally “outlawed” by this consensus-SU, which in this community serves much the samefunction as religion elsewhere.Also as in religion, scientific/academic-community“heresies” - individual or group SU concepts inconsistentwith the orthodoxy of the moment - are ignored, and ifnecessary actively suppressed and denounced [thecondescending term is “debunked”]. Centuries agoreligious heretics were tortured and executed. Modernacademic/scientific heretics will merely find themselvesOrwell’s “unpersons”: unpublished, unemployed, andprofessionally exiled. The more frightening heretics, fromGalileo to Wilhelm Reich, have been denounced as“insane” and imprisoned or killed.In the more mundane, proletarian culture of religion,the approved/collective SU is called “God” and theinconvenient, annoying ones “Satan”. [The names foreach vary across cultures, but the underlying tension isthe same.] Where religion is taken literally and seriously,as in medieval Europe and present-day fundamentalistJudaism, Islam, and Christianity, this can result inindividual murder and/or collective war.- 19 -Even when one manages to recognize and appreciatethe individual CSU, this is still not the end of the Quest,not yet the core of conscious existence. The CSU remainsa mechanism, a lens, a means of interpretation used bythe ultimate self - commonly alluded to as the psyche or“soul”, which is the actual locus of conscious being. Sincethis soul is an absolutely unique singularity, it can only beidentified and realized - not defined in terms of anythingexternal or component. It is ethereal, and it is thisethereality which has disconcerted many of thoseattempting to examine it. As it is sensed to be somethingdistinct and apart from not just the OU, but even its own/utility SUs, it has been both revered and feared becauseof its mysterious but conspicuous existence.Most humans who are either voluntary or involuntaryslaves to collective SUs, either secular or religious, shunconfrontation of the soul, which is clearly not a product ofnor controllable by such collective SUs. Materialists whoprofess the OU as the only reality customarily deny thatthe soul exists at all; they say it is merely an illusiongenerated by the individual CSU mechanism to give thatdevice an artificial sense of consciousness, e.g. ofdeliberate direction or purpose.Conventional religion adherents, also sensing that thesoul is distinct from and beyond the control of “God” (theOU and religion-dictated common SU), demonize it: It iseither the Devil or an extension of the Devil, by whatevername(s) he is known. As such, the soul must be forcedinto obedience and compliance, so that it is a non-threatto the common SU. It must be rejected, denied, punished,and if all of these fail, destroyed by killing the humanbody which it is thought to inhabit and depend upon forits existence. Hence history’s religious wars, pogroms,persecutions, exterminations, from the social to theindividual level.- 20 -A somewhat different approach is that of collectiveSUs such as Buddhism, which grapple with the soul bytrying to redefine it as a multiplicity of SU images, eitherindividual or collective, each of which can then be forcedinto harmony with or absorption into those externalimages, thus eliminating any sense of separateness. Inactuality this is nothing more than the monotheisticdemonization recast into artificial fragments to makethem seem more tangible and malleable.Finally, though less prevalent and conspicuous, areesoteric initiatory efforts to deliberately and intentionallymerge or blend the individual soul with the presumed“universal soul”, which is vaguely thought to be asomewhat similar entity for the OU [and collective SUs ofchoice] “beyond and behind everything”. This approachdoes not require the individual soul to be rejected,punished, or destroyed, but instead to be “purified” byany number of disciplines and exercises. When it hasbeen completely so cleansed, it will [re]join the universalsoul in ecstatic dissolution of its separateness. While acomforting proposition for those who prefer soothing tosuffering, there is simply nothing to support orsubstantiate the existence of a universal soul. Eachindividual soul senses itself and can be sensed by otherbeings with souls, but on a universal scale there is noevidence whatever of any consciousness or volition suchas would be necessary to identify such. [In conventionalreligions such acts of deliberation and purpose beyondthe static are referred to as “miracles”. But except for theimaginatively credulous and faithful, no “miracle” hasever actually occurred.]As the soul is unique and completely singular, it isinherently impossible to define or describe it - only toapprehend and identify it. As noted above, this isfrustrating and even alarming to humans who areaccustomed to be able to regard everything as a “building- 21 -block” or combination of such blocks. Thus they canmake everything mechanical and so definable andpractical: the realms of physical and other sciences. Theconsequence is to simply ignore or deny the soul.Nevertheless it exists; it is the “ultimate You” of eachindividual. It is not just important, but indeed centrallyso. Absent it, indeed, there would be no perceiver of, noactor upon “otherness”. Everything beyond it, from theindividual SU to the OU, would be absolutely, utterlyirrelevant. All such external existence and phenomenawould be entirely meaningless. It would make nodifference whether any of it existed or not.This truth was perhaps first realized by existentialistssuch as Jean-Paul Sarte, who in Nausea sought to expressthe “horror” of incidental non-self existence. That thereshould be such objects and phenomena merelyhaphazardly struck him as nothing short of obscene. Allnon-self must have meaning and purpose assigned to it toovercome this primal obscenity.Such assignment of meaning was assumed by theancients to be the province of divine, superuniversalintelligences: popularly gods/God. Derivative of thisauthority was the directed assemblage of various suchcomponents into the physical and phenomenological OUas humans have come to discover it.MindStar is a book about the “soul”, specificallyyours: what it is, where to find it, what to do with it [asyou may be so inclined]. Enjoy the adventure!One more thing: As you proceed through this book,you may get the uncanny feeling that you knoweverything in it already: the text is more a reminder thana teacher. Quite correct, as MindStar is deliberatelydesigned as an exercise in anamnesis, about which youwill be specifically reminded in due course.MindStar is also not merely educational orentertaining; it is transformative. Reading it, assuming- 22 -you have the intelligence and attention to comprehend it,will set your feet on the path from mortal to immortal,from human to divinity.Before reading further, therefore, reflect carefullyupon the consequences of doing so. This is a judgmentwith which every Initiate of Set is familiar, but MindStardoes not require that formality. The choice and decision,however, are no less metamorphic.This realization and choice have been the subject ofvarious legends and illustrations throughout humanity’smany eras and cultures. One of the most poignant wasthe story of Ayesha, Priestess of Isis, as related by herself.Guided throughout her life by the sage Noot to accept herhuman discipleship of that neter of the natural order,Ayesha was finally entrusted with the guardianship of aFlame which possessed the power to transform anyonewho stepped within it to personal divinity. What was notevident was the inescapability of creative definition, andthe absolute loneliness in exercising it, which authenticgodhood entails. Warned Noot:Yonder fire will not destroy the mortal who findsthe courage to stand in its raging path; it will give himlife, and with it such strength, such beauty, and suchwisdom as have never been the lot of man born ofwoman. Also it will give him such passions, suchdespairs, such unending woes as hitherto no mortalheart has known.There is the truth. Ask me not how it comes into mykeeping and what that voice may be which is speakingit through my lips. A minute gone this truth was minealone. Now it is yours also, and being yours, I pray tothat Divine from which we come and whither we returnagain, that it may give you strength and the truewisdom, knowing all, to reject all, and turning asidefrom this glittering guerdon of enduring life, patiently[index-23_1.png]- 23 -to walk your human path to the end appointed to ourhuman feet. 4Ultimately Ayesha heeded the call of the Fire and inits embrace was transformed into She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, immortal and omnipotent, with a beauty suchthat none could look upon her without succumbing tomadness. Veiled, she endured countless centuries amongthose whose human dullness enabled them to find thesimple natural pleasures and contentments that werenow intolerable to her.This is the danger of MindStar: that it will make youwhat you envision yourself to become, and empower youto see through and beyond all human illusions. Also that,as Ayesha also discovered, once attained, it is notreversible. Give careful thought to Noot’s warning,therefore, before you too enter the Flame. Because if youdo, there is no turning back: not just for the span of ahuman life, but forever.If this terrifies you, read no further. Destroy thisbook. 5San FranciscoJanuary 1, 2016 CE4 Haggard, H.

In this casean overwhelming preponderance of evidence fromnumerous authentic sources pointed to the tenaciousexistence of certain forces of great power and, so faras the human point of view is concerned, exceptionalmalignancy.- H.P. LovecraftA. MultiversalityThe phenomenon of individual consciousness is notidentifiable in a vacuum. For humans to recognize thisfacility, they must first become aware of an environmentoutside themselves, then realize, if initially only passively,that they are severally something distinct from it.This would seem to be a simple and obviousjuxtaposition, and so it is on a subconscious level:Humans go through their lives differentiating themselvesfrom their surroundings and other humans in anynumber of habitual, stimulus/response contexts.Nevertheless while these same humans are casuallycomfortable apprehending the external environment,they are far less certain about, and comfortable with- 26 -perceiving and describing themselves as consciousindividuals. Indeed it is this confusion which is at thecore of humanity’s greatest discord among its speciesthroughout its recorded history, as is surveyed herein.Put simply, until you are clear as to what you are andwhat you are not, and what these differentiations are, youcannot make an intelligent decision concerning yourbehavior and its rationale. While this might sounddaunting at first glance - the stuff of turgid theologicalpuffery or excruciating graduate philosophy courses, it isactually quite obvious and straightforward. All you haveto do is to confront it openly and honestly, which isexactly what MindStar seeks to facilitate.For starters, the odds are that if the ordinary humanwere asked “How many universes are there?”, theconfident answer would be “One.”. Actually there areseveral, and an appreciation of this is crucial to questionsconcerning human identity.B. The Objective UniverseThe Objective Universe (hereafter “OU”) is what mosthumans are accustomed to regarding as “the only”universe, e.g. the totality of matter and energy inexistence [of which these same humans would justassume themselves to be components].Humans are aware of the OU because they bump intoit all the time, from stubbing one’s toe to examininggalaxies through telescopes. This surrounding is soconstant and pervasive that they are physically andphysiologically “addicted” to it: Removing such constantsensory reinforcement normally produces disorientationfollowed by panic and “insanity”. For the vast majority ofhumanity, ironically, it is thus the impress of the OUupon them which provides and reinforces their“individuality”.- 27 -Humans have gradually realized that the OU is notchaotic and haphazard; it exists and functions accordingto inflexible regularities, normally known as natural - or,as they are discovered, “scientific” - laws. In prehistoricand primitive cultures, before such laws were known toexist and be thus inflexible, the OU was assumed to be avariable at the manipulative whim of gods/God, andconsiderable effort was devoted to worshipping orappeasing such entities to prevent natural disasters orcataclysms. Of course there were/are enough randominteractions of natural laws to lend credence to “divineintervention” explanations, particularly when preached toignorant masses.Conventional questions concerning the OU include:(1) How did it come into being? (2) Why is it organized asit is? (3) Who created natural law? (4) Why is natural lawso completely and permanently enforced? (5) Does theOU have a purpose, or is it just a gigantic accident? Andof course: (6) What is/should be humanity’s relationshipto the OU?Obviously humanity has been accustomed toaddressing, if not answering many of these questions byreligious myth. It is easier for the ordinary mind tovisualize a God impulsively snapping the OU intoexistence at a chosen point in time, for example, than tograpple with the fact that it has always existed; no“creative act” was therefore needed.As for natural law, human science has no ideawhatever why it is what it is, or what enforces it. Sciencecontents itself with discovering and codifying such law“as it is”, period.Concerning humanity’s relationship to the OU, this isexamined in some historical detail in this book’sdiscussion of telos.- 28 -C. The Subjective UniverseThe Subjective Universe (hereafter “SU”) is each self-conscious being’s perception of the OU, blended withpersonally-generated overlays, selective impressions, andcreative imagination as instinctive, indoctrinated,inspired, and/or initiated.Thus not even the most controlled physical scientistcan claim to accurately and completely see the OU. Whathe sees is his filtration and distortion of it through his SU,which he has built up both consciously andsubconsciously from innumerable sources since birth.More creative, artistic, mystical, etc. personalities maylet their SUs run even more freely, to the point where theOU is of only occasional and necessary relevance to them.If some such persons reach a stage where their SUs havecompletely replaced the OU, they may be called “insane”;in this sense “sanity” is a measure of an individual’ssuppression of his SU within socially-sanctionedboundaries.D. Subjective/Objective InteractionOnce the simultaneous and permanent existence ofthe OU and SU is recognized, much of the mystery ofhuman history and behavior is no longer mysterious. Itjust requires examination of each such individual, group,and/or event to identify the applicable OU forces and thevarious individual SUs through which they are beingperceived and influenced, both subconsciously andconsciously.At the subconscious level, for instance, an individualmay assume that everyone else “sees the same reality”that he does, when in fact this is never completely thecase.- 29 -At the conscious level the SU can be both easier andmore problematic to handle. Easier to the extent that theindividual is making willful decisions about how much ofhis SU he can successfully apply. More problematicinsofar as others with their differing subconscious andconscious SUs may be present and involved.E. Collective Subjective UniversesWhen more than one SU is present and involved inany society or problem situation, it should be obviousthat no two of them will coincide, both in terms ofsubconscious “reality perception” and conscious values,desires, and actions applied.Hence both human society and human history is mostaccurately understood as attempts by the involvedhumans to reconcile their conflicting SUs into one ormore community-approved Collective SUs (hereafter“CSU”). Sometimes this is possible through peacefulmeans such as education, reasoning, or argument. Inother instances where conscious SUs are too passionate,or when subconscious SUs are too inflexible andintolerant, the individuals/groups may resort to coercion- aggressive and intensive indoctrination, conditioning,and reinforcement, along with the suppression orextermination of the offending “competitors” - to achievethe desired “reality”.In modern society, unsurprisingly, such coercion andintolerance are invariably attributed to “the enemy”,domestic outlaws, insurgents, revolutionaries, or other“alien” individuals or groups. It is assumed, without anyneed for argument or justification, that the communityCSU into which its members have been conditioned sincebirth, is not just one among many options, but is“reality”. Questioning it thus goes beyond acceptablecuriosity to “heresy”, “treason”, or “insanity”.- 30 -This was most famously caricatured in GeorgeOrwell’s novel 1984, in which failure to accept the Party’sCSU not just at the conscious but at the subconscious“reality” level was condemned as the worst of all possiblesins: “thoughtcrime” - correspondingly requiring not justpunishment but “curing” by destroying the offender’sability to see “reality” other than through the Party’s CSU.F. The Universal Course of MindStarAs foretold, the above keys to the age-old “mystery” ofhuman behavior are not the least bewildering once oneknows to look for and apply them.MindStar, however, is not merely a guide to the studyof human rational and irrational behavior. It is notenough [nor is it reassuring!] just to realize that one issurrounded by a world of humanity which is trapped in ag e n e r a l l y - u n r e c o g n i z e d p r i s o n o f c o n f l i c t i ngsubconscious and conscious SUs. From the smallestsocial unit to worldwide ideologies and wars, helpless andhapless people are flailing around with the “disease”without even recognizing it for what it is, much lesstreating its symptoms. It was for this reason that I wrotethe companion book to MindStar: MindWar. UnlikeMindStar, MindWar is a practical manual for thediagnosis and constructive correction of social violencefrom the community to the international scale. It isintentionally exoteric and unintrospective. It does notseek to expose ordinary minds to the metaphysics ofconsciousness. It is a prescription for the many, for thepolis, not the individual.MindStar is quite the other thing: a guide exclusivelyfor the individual, which never compromises with groupinfluences, needs, perceptions, or pressures. It is a map tothe Grail Castle, which journey and adventure areessentially and inescapably unique to each individual.[index-31_1.png]- 31 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2: CONSCIOUS EXISTENCEWe are all wired into a survival trip now. No more ofthe speed that fueled that 60s. That was the fatalflaw in Tim Leary’s trip. He crashed around Americaselling “consciousness expansion” without evergiving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities thatwere lying in wait for all the people who took himseriously: all those pathetically eager acid freaks whothought they could buy Peace and Understanding forthree bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ourstoo. What Leary took down with him was the centralillusion of a whole life-style that he helped create: ageneration of permanent cripples, failed seekers,who never understood the essential old-mysticfallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumptionthat somebody, or at least some force, is tending thelight at the end of the tunnel. - Hunter S. ThompsonA. ConsciousnessHaving in Chapter #1 established and defined theenvironment in which existence occurs, it is nextnecessary to discuss who or what exists to perceive andinteract with this environment. A phenomenon ofdistinction from that environment is essential, and itmust be aware of itself to recognize and appreciate thatdistinction. It is inherently a function, not a thing,traditionally called “consciousness”. [The question of the- 32 -“thing that is conscious” is addressed in subsequentchapters.]Consciousness is both easy and difficult to establish -easy because its presence is obvious: the mere awareness[of self and/or anything else] characteristic of a living,sentient being. Having achieved this realization, thepossessors of consciousness have found its constitutionmaddeningly elusive.Over the centuries theologians, philosophers, andscientists have sought to portray and advocateconsciousness as something either supporting or refutingthe existence of what is really their concern: the “soul”.B. Metaphysics: Consciousness as an EntitySince conventional theology regards consciousness as“the soul in action”, it has generally been happy to justblur the two concepts into a single, nothing-further-needed axiom of religious faith.Philosophers seeking to escape the label of such merefaith found that the moment they strayed from the simpleact of self-awareness, they were actually addressing otherissues, such as whether physical sensory input is/wasoccurring, whether such input is reliable, and indeedwhether the mental processing of concepts andinformation (e.g. “thought”) should somehow be either arequirement or evidence of awareness. René Descartes’famous “cogito ergo sum” (= I think, therefore I am) is anexample of such off-the-mark confusion; arguments bothpro and con this maxim have all focused on the act ofthinking rather than mere self-awareness.C. Physics: Consciousness as an IllusionModern physical science is adamantly materialistic;any hint of a metaphysical presence or activity is- 33 -tantamount to heresy. If consciousness exists, therefore,it must be explainable [away] as the physical braingenerating some form of illusory self-imagery.In support of this theory, scientists note that if thebrain is anæsthetized, the individual “blacks out”. Alsowhen the body and brain sleep, consciousness eitherblacks out or becomes merely a spectator to hallucination(e.g. dreaming).Upon examination both of these scientific claims failto be conclusive. As ordinary consciousness isaccustomed to being reactive to physical sensory input,the sudden muting of all such input by anæsthesia throwsthe consciousness into a sudden non-sensory mode withwhich it has no experience. The result is temporaryinactivity, though below the level of sensory imagery itcontinues to receive stimulus signals from the physicalbody.In certain anæsthesia applications, moreover, thebody’s transmissions to the consciousness are mutedw h i l e t h a t c o n s c i o u s n e s s r e m a i n s a l e r t a n dcommunicative. If it were merely a function of the body’snormal physical sensory processes, this would not occur.Where sleep and dreaming are concerned, it hasalready been established that the quality and coherenceof the act of thinking is an entirely different concern thanself-awareness per se.Where ordinary sleep and dreaming are concerned,once again awareness must not be confused withthinking. In short, the random imagination characteristicof dreams, or the absence of such experiences if theresting brain has so lowered its sensory transmissions,has no relevance to awareness. Being self-aware does notrequire this to be continuous.- 34 -D. InconsequenceThe phenomenon of self-awareness is as a simpleincident essential to validating the distinction betweenthe individual and the OU. Beyond this, however, it is nota component of either a “soul” or the physical brain/bodywhich can be used to verify either premise. Indeed in thesearch for the “soul” awareness is something of a redherring, being confused with the thinking process byagenda-advocates.[index-35_1.png]- 35 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3: EGYPTPoor men, most admirable, most pitiable,With all their changes all their great Creeds changeFor Man, this alien in my family,Is alien most in this, to cherish dreamsAnd brood on visions of eternity,And build religions in his brooding brainAnd in the dark depths awe-full of his soul.My other children live their little lives,Are born and reach their prime and slowly fail,And all their little lives are self-fulfilled;They die and are no more, content with ageAnd weary with infirmity.

Confronting Ancient EgyptIt is impossible to proceed further with this inquirywithout bringing to bear the wisdom of ancient Egypt. Bycontrast, the efforts of later cultures have been little morethan ignorant fumbling in the dark.- 36 -Before turning to the specifics of Egyptian knowledgein this area, however, popular modern misperceptionsmust be at least briefly corrected.The topic of ancient Egypt generally has been one ofboth exhaustive examination by and contentious debatebetween conventional Egyptologists and independentinvestigators.The former group generally agree that Egypt wassimply an agricultural society comparable to that of otherMediterranean/Near-Eastern cultures of the time-period.It was notable for its enigmatic hieroglyphic writingsystem, odd-looking formalized art, peculiar massivebuilding projects, and morbid, animal-totem religiouscultism.The latter group, while differing in the details, seeEgypt rather as a remarkable, indeed startling exceptionto its primitive neighbors. It was uniquely a civilizationand repository of great sophistication and wisdom - insome respects so much so, indeed, that the very ability ofthe Egyptians themselves to have generated such utopianwonders is called into question in favor of Atlanteans,extraterrestrial visitors, and/or incarnated gods.Each camp routinely ridicules the other. Theconventionalists denounce the independents asunscientific dreamers and “pyramidiots”. The latter areequally contemptuous of the former, considering them asmerely a brittle academic self-protectorate afraid toviolate modern taboos.And there are two taboos in particular whichinstitutional academia does not dare to transgress - oreven openly acknowledge as taboos.First, modern [Western] civilization is assumed to beat the zenith of human sophistication in all respects. Ithas been steadily improving over the last five thousandyears (after recorded history officially began ca. 3000BCE). Since the passage of time mandates social- 37 -evolution and improvement, it is heresy to suggest thatan ancient civilization, particularly one at the verybeginning of this progression, could actually have beensuperior to its successors, including those today, in someif not all respects.Secondly, the world today is divided into three majormonotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.All, even in countries where they have become largelypropaganda devices for the control of the lesser-intelligent masses, are as exclusive and intolerant aspolitically permitted. Despite their doctrinal differences,however, they are all agreed that there exists but oneGod - the Hebraic JHVH. Thus all polytheism, whethernew or old, is false and fictitious. It follows that any suchfiction cannot possibly be as, much less moresophisticated than Hebraic monotheism [as triple-modified]. Egyptian religion may be studied, exploited forartistic purposes and horror movies, but never actuallybelieved in.B. Egyptian HistoryLet us now review those aspects of ancient Egypt onwhich most scholars, the academic and the arcane, mightbe expected to find some common ground.The earliest existing evidence of human culture in theNile valley dates to more than 250,000 BCE, as theremnants of hand axes and other stone tools have beenuncovered 50-100’ below the Nile’s silt terrace.Sometime between 10,000 and 7,000 BCE, accordingto conventional archæology, a most important event tookplace - the domestication of the wild African goat and thesubsequent freedom to begin cultivation of grain. Thiseffectively heralded the beginning of human civilization,as for the first time primitive man was free to turn histhoughts to matters other than a constant search for food.- 38 -By the same consensus, it was in the pre-dynasticGerzean period (commencing about 3600 BCE) that thefirst communities of the future Egyptian nation came intoexistence. A great war of unification commenced inapproximately 3400 BCE. After more than two centuriesof intermittent conflict between Upper and Lower Egypt,the land was finally united under Menes (or Narmer), thefirst pharaoh of the I Dynasty. 6Inhabiting a land characterized by the regularity ofthe elements (behavior of the winds, the Nile, the climate,the Sun, and the skies), the Egyptians sought perfectionin stability, harmony, symmetry, geometry, and a cyclical[as opposed to progressive or linear] concept of time.In modern culture we take progressive/linear time forgranted. It is as inevitable and inexorable as the hands ofthe wristwatches to which we are gently, yet firmlymanacled. We see our lives, and indeed the entire knownuniverse, as a terrible struggle against entropy, endingultimately in the death, decomposition, and obliterationof each separate person or thing.It is further this perception, and the fear of it, whichhas lent Hebraic monotheism a vampiric persistence farpast the 17th-18th Century “Enlightenment” which,intellectually at least, exposed it as a sham. For theChristian and Muslim versions, if not the Jewish, promisecontinuation of the same life after physical death, albeitwith dire punishment specifically for not believing in andobeying them now.The Egyptians, however, envisioned neitherthemselves nor the world about them to be entrapped insuch a fearsome forced-march. They saw the Sun, Moon,and firmament behaving in recurring cycles, as also therise and fall of the Nile, the regular seasons, plant life. If6 Fairservis, Walter A. Jr., The Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile. NewYork: New American Library/Mentor #MY-843, 1962, Chapters #1-2.- 39 -humans and other animals were born, lived for a time,and died, it stood to reason that they too participated inan eternal cycling of a more subtle color. Egyptianrecords would accordingly document specificpersonalities and events, but without any particularattention to related change or innovation. Harmony withthe cycles of things, not defiance of them, was theEgyptian ideal - which explains why the essentialcharacter of Egyptian society remained little changed,except to meet external intrusion, for thirty dynastiesextending over 3,000 years. 7Former Director of Cairo’s French OrientalArchæological Institute Serge Sauneron comments:To understand the attitude of the Egyptians, it isnecessary to emphasize the striking contrast betweentheir view of the world and ours. We live in a universewhich we know is in perpetual movement; each newproblem demands a new solution. But for the Egyptiansthis notion of time which modifies the currentknowledge of the world, of an alteration of factorswhich forces a change in methods, had no place. In thebeginning the divinity created a stable world, fixed,definitive; this world functions as a motor well oiledand well fed. If there are “misfires” - if the motor fades,if one of the parts making it up is worn out or broken -it is replaced and everything starts off again better thanbefore. But this motor would always remain the same;its mechanism, its appearance, its output would alwaysbe identical.If some problem intrigues the mind, therefore - ifsome serious event arises to disturb the customaryorder of things - it could not really be new; it wasforeseen with the world. Its solution or remedy exists inall eternity, revealed in a kind of universal “manner of7 The XXX Dynasty is generally considered to be the last nativeEgyptian one. Subsequently there was a Persian one (XXXI) and aPtolemaic Greek one (XXXII), ending with the death of Cleopatra VIIand Roman rule in 30 BCE.- 40 -use” that the gods defined in creating the universeitself. What is necessary, therefore, is to find in theancient writings the formula that foresaw such-and-such a case. Before a given event - a physicalphenomenon, a catastrophe striking the whole country- the scholar would not seek to discover the actualcauses in order to find an appropriate remedy. Ratherhe would examine with scholarly ardor the volumes ofold writings to find out if the event had alreadyoccurred in some moment of the past, and whatsolution had then been applied to it. 8In accordance with their cyclical perception of reality,therefore, the Egyptians’ achievements tended to be in“timeless” areas such as astronomy, mathematics,medicine, and architecture. These, along with Egyptianreligion and art, are often oversimplified in many moderntreatments, due in part to the absence of verifiable data inlater history until the deciphering of hieroglyphics byChampollion in 1822. Because of the destruction anddespoliation of ancient Egyptian records and works of artby religious fanatics of later eras, it is estimated thatmodern archæologists have at their disposal less than10% of that country’s cultural creations from which toreconstruct its values. 9Egypt was divided into 42 nomes (provinces), eachdominated by the priesthood of one or more neteru. Aparticular priesthood might also influence more than onenome. The monarchy was closely controlled by thevarious orders of priesthood, with the pharaoh acting asan Earthly deputy of and interpreter for the neteru.Governmental, judicial, and political systems wereresponsible for their ethics to the neteru, not to the8 Sauneron, Serge, Les pretres de l’ancienne Egypte. New York:Grove Press, 1980, pages #118-119.9 Cf. Fagan, Brian M., The Rape of the Nile. New York: CharlesScribner’s Sons, 1975.- 41 -people. Justice was meted out by viziers (internal rovingambassadors of the pharaoh) and nome governorsaccording to the neter of justice, Maat, on an individual-case basis. There was no concept of individual rightsagainst the government, because government was viewedas a system imposed from without by the neteru.Similarly each Egyptian, whether high- or lowborn,participated in this system. Crime and corruption were ofcourse possible, but inadvisable because of the convictionthat viciousness, callousness, or cruelty would bepunished severely after Earthly death. 10 [It is of note thatsuch posthumous judgment focused upon individualvirtue/vice rather than, as in later Christian/Islamicdoctrine, upon mere orthodoxy and obedience toreligious institutions.]Old Kingdom Egypt was largely insulated from foreigninvasion or conflict, hence Egypt spent its early years as apeaceful culture with no standing military. Egypt iscredited with invention of the alphabet, as well as the useof currency as a medium of exchange. It is noteworthy forhaving produced the first national (as opposed to city-state) political system, as well as the most enduring onein recorded history (more than 3,000 years). There wasno caste, racial, or sexual discrimination; foreigners wereconsidered “less than human (=Egyptian)”, but couldremedy this misfortune simply by moving to Egypt andadopting Egyptian culture.Egypt was ultimately destroyed by foreign conquerors(Persia, Macedonia, Rome) and by her inability to adaptto the continuing competition of foreign cultures. HerNew Empire of the Setian (XIX-XX) Dynasties was aprotectionist backlash rather than an effort to “civilize” or10 Wilson, John A., “Egypt” in Frankfort, Henri (Ed.), BeforePhilosophy. Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1946.- 42 -create a permanent empire [after the fashion of Persia,Macedonia, or Rome].C. The NeteruThe Egyptians perceived the Universe as activelycontrolled by conscious, natural principles ( neteru) ofwhich Sir E.A. Wallis Budge remarks:The word neter has been translated “godlike”,“holy”, “divine”, “sacred”, “power”, “strength”, “force”,“strong”, “fortify”, “mighty”, “protect”; but it is quiteimpossible to be certain that any word which we mayuse represents the meaning of neter, because no oneknows exactly what idea the ancient Egyptians attachedto the word. The truth is that the exact meaning ofneter was lost at a very early period of Egyptian history,and even the Coptic does not help us to recover it. 11To the Egyptians, all of “nature” (derived from neter)was alive and the direct consequence of the wills of theneteru. Nature was intelligible not just throughinanimate, automatic, general regularities which could bediscovered via the “scientific method”; but also throughconnections and associations between things andevents perceived in the human mind. There was nodistinction between “reality” and “appearance”; anythingcapable of exerting an effect upon the mind therebyexisted. Hence a dream could be considered just as “real”and thus significant as a daytime experience. No moreeloquently has this been summarized than by She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed in H. Rider Haggard’s She and Allan:11 Budge, E. A. Wallis, The Book of the Dead. New Hyde Park:University Books, 1960, page #99.- 43 -[Allan Quatermain] “I have heard of Isis of theEgyptians, Lady of the Moon, Mother of Mysteries,spouse of Osiris whose child was Horus the Avenger.”[Ayesha] “Aye, and I think will hear more of herbefore you have done, Allan, for now something comesback to me concerning you and her and another. I amnot the only one who has broken the oaths of Isis andreceived her curse, Allan, as you may find out in thedays to come. But what of these heavenly queens?”“Only this, Ayesha: I have been taught that theywere but phantasms fabled by men with many anotherfalse divinity, and could have sworn that this was true.And yet you talk of them as real and living, whichperplexes me.”“Being dull of understanding doubtless it perplexesyou, Allan. Yet if you had imagination, you mightunderstand that these goddesses are great principlesof nature: Isis of throned Wisdom and strait virtue,and Aphrodite of Love as it is known to men andwomen who, being human, have it laid upon them thatthey must hand on the torch of life in their little hour.Also you would know that such principles can seem totake shape and form and at certain ages of he worldappear to their servants visible in majesty, thoughperchance today others with changed names wield theirsceptres and work their will. Now you are answered onthis matter.”The Egyptian concept of “magic”, correspondingly,was neither unusual or exceptional. It merely representedthe setting in motion of appropriate neteru forces toaccomplish a desired end: which could be throughphysical action, symbolic ritual, art, or speech ( heka). Amagical operation thus initially required perception ( sia)of a necessity, followed by utterance of the heka ( hw) toaddress it.Egyptian art, literature, and science looked for beautyand symmetry (felt to be indications of divine perfection),rather than for cause-and-effect relationships. HenceEgyptian thought is sometimes called “geometric” as- 44 -opposed to the “algebraic” thought of Hellenic and laterlogicians.Since impressions and appearances substantiatedreality, the Egyptian emphasis on portraits and statues ofthe neteru was not merely decorative, metaphorical, orsymbolic. Rather an image was a medium whereby theneter in question could make an actual appearance in thematerial world. 12Similarly part of something could substitute for thewhole as long as the mind completed the connection.Mental imagery created by viewing the portrait of a deadrelative, for example, brought that relative to true life.Persons unfamiliar with the ancient Egyptian cultureoften assume that the Egyptian religion, like those of laterMediterranean civilizations, consisted of a single,integrated pantheon of anthropomorphic gods andgoddesses. It is rather the case that the earliest Egyptianneteru were provincial, being patrons of individual citiesand districts (nomes). Nor, despite their famous human/beast composite appearances, were they mere“ s u p e r n a t u r a l p e r s o n s ” i n t h e l a t e r G r e e k ,Mesopotamian, or Roman mold. While popular storieswere woven about them - presumably for popularconsumption - the hieroglyphic treatment of the Egyptianneteru suggests that they actually represented variousaspects of existence - the “Forms” or “First Principles”discussed by Pythagoras and Plato in a more abstractmanner. 1312 Cf. Schaefer, Heinrich, Principles of Egyptian Art. Oxford:Clarendon Press, 1974. Contrast Egyptian statuary with Greek,Roman, or later European. The “living presence” in the former will bedramatically evident.13 Cf. Winspear, Alban D., The Genesis of Plato’s Thought. New York:S.A. Russell, 1940. Also Cf. Aquino, M.A., “The Sphinx and theChimæra” (Appendix #1).- 45 -Intriguingly the neteru may have had a physicalpresence as well. The 30-Dynasty dating system mostarchæologists use for ancient Egypt comes fromManetho, an Egyptian priest at Sebennytos in the NileDelta ca. 280 BCE. Manetho’s dynastic list extendsbackward before Menes and the I Dynasty date of 3100BCE: 350 years Thinites; 1,790 years other Memphitekings; 1,817 years other kings; 1,255 years “Heroes”; andbefore that 13,900 years in which the neteru reignedphysically on Earth.Obviously this chronology would conflict with the“accepted” prehistory of Egypt as summarized at thebeginning of this appendix. Conventional Egyptologistsare comfortable only with a “civilization began suddenlyin 3100 BCE” scenario, hence Manetho is relied uponvery strongly after that date, but swept under the rugprior to it. 14Commerce, protective alliances, cultural contact, andfinally the unification of the entire nation ca. 3100 BCEresulted in the gradual incorporation of local neteru intoregional groups, and then into a loosely-knit nationalpantheon. Local and regional cult centers continued tohold their respective patrons in especial regard, however,and so the character and role of a specific neter mightvary remarkably from place to place. Individual dynastiesalso tended to be oriented to particular cult centers, andso the neteru in question would be elevated - at least for atime - to the status of national patrons. 15The information concerning these cults which isavailable to modern Egyptologists is both sparse and14 Hoffman, Michael A., Egypt Before the Pharaohs. New York:Alfred A. Knopf, 1979. Fix, Wm. R., Pyramid Odyssey. New York:Mayflower Books, 1978.15 Ions, Veronica, Egyptian Mythology. New York: HamlynPublishing Group, 1968, pages #11-13.- 46 -confusing. Since a given neter could be portrayed in anumber of different ways, identifying the “core neter” isdifficult. The images and inscriptions concerning a neterwere often altered or appropriated by cultists of rivalneteru. In Christian and Islamic times all “old gods” wereconsidered blasphemous, and monuments to them wereregularly defaced and destroyed. By the end of the fifthcentury CE, knowledge of hieroglyphics had died out, notto reappear until the nineteenth century; meanwhilemany “useless” records perished through neglect.For two reasons the cult of Osiris ( Asar) and Isis( Asa) has been emphasized in modern literature: First, itwas the last cult to dominate the entire Egyptian nation.Thus it was in a position to do a “final editing” of non-Osirian manuscripts and monuments. Secondly it wasdescribed in detail by Plutarch, permitting its study longafter the hieroglyphic records of the other cults hadbecome unreadable. 16D. SetNo records of the ancient Priesthood of Set survivedfirst the Osirian-dynastic persecution and later the moregeneral vandalism of the Christian/Islamic eras. Weknow of it only by its reflection, both in the character ofSet as he was portrayed symbolically and mythologicallyand in the nature of Egyptian priesthoods in general.Three significant facts are known about the Priesthood ofSet:16 Budge, Egyptian Language. New York: Dover Publications, 1971,page #15. Ions, op.cit. , pages #50-55. Fagan, op.cit. , pages #34-36.Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, Volume V in Moralia (14 volumes), F.C.Babbitt (Ed. & Trans.). London: Loeb Classical Library, 1936.- 47 -(1) Together with the Priesthood of Horus [theElder], it was the oldest of the Egyptianpriesthoods. If we date it to the earliest predynasticimages of Set found by archæologists, we can establish anorigin of at least 3200 BCE. Working with the Egyptians’own astronomically-based records, we may approximate5000 BCE. 17 If we are to assume the final eclipse of thePriesthood at the end of the XIX-XX [Setian] Dynastiesca. 1085 BCE, we are looking at an institution whichexisted at least two thousand and possibly as many asfour thousand years. “In the early dynasties,” observesBudge:Set was a beneficent god, and one whose favor wassought after by the living and by the dead, and so lateas the XIX Dynasty kings delighted to call themselves“Beloved of Set”. After the cult of Osiris was firmlyestablished and this god was the “great god” of allEgypt, it became the fashion to regard Set as the originof all evil, and his statues and images were soeffectively destroyed that only a few which haveescaped by accident have come down to us. 18One may note that Set was by no means the only“fabulous” creature ever portrayed by Egyptian artists.But he was the only one represented as a principal neter,as opposed to a purely-animalistic monster of the Tuat.(2) Set was the neter who was “different” fromall of the others. Too often this is simplified into hisbeing the “evil” slayer of Osiris, hence the personificationof “evil”; yet any but the most cursory study of Egyptianreligious symbolism is sufficient to dispel this caricature.17 Lockyer, J. Norman, The Dawn of Astronomy. Cambridge: MITPress, 1964, page #215.18 Budge, The Book of the Dead, page #181.- 48 -He was rather a neter “against the neteru”: the entity whosymbolized that which is not of nature.This is a very curious role for a neter in Egyptiancosmology: to be a presence and force which alone couldnot be apprehended by perceptions of the natural senses.Set thus represents the nameless “thing” whose existencewe know of by the shadow it casts on things apprehendedand things perceived by it: the non-natural “presence ofself” ( telos) in individual intelligent life.Various post-Egyptian cultures have generalized thevehicle by which this presence is manifest as the spirit,psyche, or soul, but increased precision is possible. Wemust subtract from such crudeness what is “life force”,and focus our attention on that which remains: the veryawareness of self. In doing so we have in one senseretraced the path of Descartes to the cogito ergo sumproposition. Unlike Descartes, however, we see thisphenomenon to be a “thing totally apart” which is not anextension of “God” or anything else. Set is theconceptualizer of this principle: the designer. To rewritethe crucial sentence in the above quote from the point ofview of a neter: “A thing created in the mind therebyexists.”This is delicate ground to tread, so much more so foran ancient Egyptian civilization whose entire “natural”cosmology was based upon the perfection and harmonyof the Universe.(3) Despite this unique and disturbing image,or perhaps because of it, Set became the patronof the two most powerful dynasties in Egypt’slong history, the XIX and XX. Herein there is aninteresting “theological succession”:The early XVIII Dynasty (ca. 1580-1372) was that ofthe great Amenhoteps, during whose reigns thePriesthood of Amon at Thebes was preeminent. The- 49 -dynasty disintegrated during the “Amarna period” (ca.1372-1343) of Akhenaten, during which the solar disk ofAton was considered supreme if not indeed all-inclusiveof the neteru. When the new XIX Dynasty arose underRameses I and Seti I, the state role of Amon was restored- but the pharaohs directed much of their efforts towardsSet. Recounts Sauneron:The new dynasty in power, careful to appear to be“restoring everything to order”, had many reasons formistrusting the Amonian priesthood. Descendants of amilitary family of the eastern delta, the new pharaohswere traditionally devoted to a god little esteemed bythe masses because of the role that he had beenassigned in the death of Osiris. But they preservednevertheless, here and there, the temples andpriesthoods of the god Set.The Amarnian experience had demonstrated thecost of too abrupt a break with the beliefs central to theentire nation, and of entering into open warfare againsta priesthood practically as powerful as the throne itself.Thus the politics of Seti I (1312-1301) and of Rameses II(1301-1235) were infinitely more subtle than those oftheir predecessors. There was no rupture with Thebes;the constructions continued, and magnificent edificeswere raised to the glory of Amon at Karnak, Gourna,and Ramesseum. But it was from the [Osirian] centerof Abydos that Rameses appointed the High Priest ofAmon. Then he installed two of his sons, Merytum andKhamuast, as the High Priests of Ra at Heliopolis andPtah at Memphis, and demonstrated by furthermonuments and political favors his public support ofthese gods. But finally, wearied of Thebes and itsambitious priests, he departed to build a new capital,Pi-Rameses, in the eastern delta - where he couldquietly worship the god dearest to him, with Amonoccupying a secondary prominence.The provincial cities where Set had beenworshipped from all eternity - among them Ombos,Tjebu, and Sepermeru - gained new preeminence fromthe favor accorded by the Ramesside leaders to the god- 50 -of the Eastern Delta. Above all, Pi-Rameses, the newcapital, brilliantly restored the worship that Set hadformerly received in the Avaris of the Hyksos. 19During the Setian Dynasties - most probably duringthe reign of Merenptah - the revolt and “exodus” of anumber of nomads (hieroglyphic habiru) living in Egypt’sGoshen province occurred - or at least did so in Jewishlegend. Although “Old Testament” lore states that theoriginal Hebrews were a unified, foreign culture whichentered Egypt during the time of Rameses I, there are noEgyptian records substantiating this. It is more probablethat the actual participants in any “exodus” were peoplefrom a variety of ethnic backgrounds. 20 Possibly theHebrews’ hated “Satan” derives from one of the honorifictitles ( Set-hen = Eternal Set) accorded the state deity ofthe regime they were fleeing.Following the passing of the two Setian dynasties, theincreasing influence of a priesthood not courted by the19 Ibid., pages #183-184.20 Romer, John, Testament. New York: Henry Holt, 1988, page #58:“Hard evidence of the Exodus event in the preserving deserts of theSinai, where most of the biblical Wandering takes place, is similarlyelusive. Although its climate has preserved the tiniest traces ofancient bedouin encampments and the sparse, 5,000-year-oldvillages of mine-workers, there is not a single trace of Moses or theIsraelites. And they would have been by far the largest body ofancient people ever to have lived in this great wilderness. Neither isthere any evidence that Sinai and its little natural springs could everhave supported such a multitude, even for a single week. Several19th-century vicars recognized this fact within a day or two of thestart of numerous expeditions in search of Moses’ footsteps.“Escaping from the rigours of an English winter,” as one of themsays, “in a land of the flock and the tent to which our only guide wasthe Bible” they quickly realized that the biblical Exodus waslogistically impossible and that the Bible was a most ambiguousguide to that desolate region. The biblical description of the Exodus,then, flies in the face of practical experience. Indeed the closer youexamine it, the further it seems removed from all of ancient history.”- 51 -Ramesside pharaohs - that of Osiris - boded ill for thePriesthood of Set. The Osirians recast Set as Osiris’treacherous brother and mortal enemy of Osiris’ son - forwhom they appropriated the neter Horus. Not contentwith attacking Set personally, they further appropriatedhis consort and son from the original triad of his cult -Nepthys and Anubis - whom they now describedrespectively as a concubine of Osiris and a son of Osirisby Nepthys. Comments Budge:Between the XXII and the XXV Dynasties, a violentreaction set in against this god [Set]; his statues andfigures were smashed; his effigy was hammered outfrom the bas-reliefs and stelæ in which it appeared. 21Various reasons for this reaction have been proposedby Egyptologists. It is been suggested that Set fell intodisrepute through being associated in the popular mindwith the Sutekh of the invading Hyksos. Possible, butimprobable, as the Hyksos invasion occurred prior to theXIX-XX Dynasties when Set was preeminently in favor -and the presiding neter over Egypt’s greatest period ofimperial glory.Set’s eclipse may well have been due to a more subtle,yet pervasive sentiment sweeping Egypt. As Sauneronand many other Egyptologists have acknowledged,Egyptian philosophy was based upon a millennia-oldconviction of the absolute presence and influence of theneteru, and in the virtue of a social system in which thepreservation of cyclical harmony was all-important.While the New Empire of the XIX-XX Dynasties extendedEgypt’s influence to Palestine and Mesopotamia, it alsomade the Egyptians aware that there were many otherfunctioning cultures in which the neteru were unknown21 Budge, The Mummy. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1973,page #276.- 52 -[at least by their Egyptian names]. Moreover the conceptof Egypt as just one among a number of nation-statescompeting for power and influence in the Mediterranean,rather than as the one civilization at the center ofexistence, must have been a most unsettling one to thisancient culture - which previously had been able todiscount its neighbors as mere uncultured, barbariantribes.Egypt’s solution to this problem was to turn graduallyaway from a glorification of this life and towards anorientation on the afterlife, where such disturbingdilemmas could be assumed not to exist. This wouldexplain the growing influence and popularity of the Osiriscult during the post-XX Dynasty Egyptian decadence;Osiris was an afterlife neter.As the Osiris cult portrayed Set as Osiris’ nemesisrather than an independent and preexisting neter with noparticular interest in Osiris, this would also explain thesimultaneous wave of Setian persecution described byBudge. It was characteristic of ancient Egypt that eachnew dynasty, in an attempt to establish its own“timelessness”, often doctored monuments and records toeliminate inconvenient inconsistencies. Presumably theOsirian dynasties followed suit, defacing or rewriting allreferences to Set that did not support their portrayal ofhim as a “Devil”. 22 And that was the distortion of Setwhich survived in later Mediterranean legend -principally through Plutarch, who described it in somedetail in his Moralia. 23The greatest breakthrough for modern scholars ofEgyptian metaphysics came with the writings of René22 Ions, op.cit. , pages #72-78. The Osirian legends on this subject aretreated comprehensively in J. Gwyn Griffith’s The Conflict of Horusand Seth (Chicago: Argonaut Publishers, 1969).23 Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, Volume V in Moralia.- 53 -Schwaller de Lubicz and his wife Isha. Indeed muchcredit is due her, because much of René’s work is highlytechnical. Isha synthesized its elemental themes into herhighly-readable “novel” Her-Bak, a young Egyptian’sjourney from ordinary peasant to initiated priest. 24René’s initial realization came from his study ofhieroglyphs: that in addition to their convenience formere alphabetics, they embodied symbolic principlesapprehensible to both the rational and the suprarationalintelligence. [His methodology is thus often termed“Symbolism”.] Gradually he extended his awareness ofthis key to Egyptian culture into its architecture (as in hismagnum opus examination of the Luxor temple complex,Le Temple de L’Homme) and pre-Pythagoreanism.Of the various secondary works examining René’sideas, John Anthony West’s Serpent in the Sky is themost “immediately-intelligible” introduction. 25 Anothervery capable presentation is Egyptian Mysteries by LucieLamy, René’s longtime student and the talentedillustrator for both his works and Isha’s. 26In the original 1994 Stargate motion picture, theGreat Pyramid of Giza was revealed to be nothing morethan a crude, ritualistic imitation by fearful protodynasticEgyptians of the gigantic, pyramidal starships in whichcreatures beyond their comprehension had come toEarth; the stone coffer in the “King’s Chamber” was asimilar rough image of the wondrous machine in thestarships with the power to literally bring dead bodiesback to life.24 Schwaller de Lubicz, Isha, Her-Bak.

Nevertheless these Goa’uld almost uncannilydemonstrated the relationship which ordinary humanityhas with its perceived “God/gods” - and why it is quitefulfilled by such a relationship, false and oppressive as itmay be.In world after world, civilization after civilization, it isever the same; and when a Goa’uld is exposed or killed,the result is always chaos and uncertainty, with the“liberated” peoples slipping down into aimless, tedioustribalism. The wanton terrors of the Goa’uld are gone -but so are the great, gleaming Pyramidal starships, thetechnology to instantly heal all injuries and even restorebodily life itself, and the ecstatic experience of interactingwith the “gods” face-to-face.Stargate leaves its audience with an even moretantalizing mystery. If the Goa’uld borrow their personæfrom real neteru whom they have used technology toimitate, how did they originally come to know them?Which leads to my central question about theancient Egyptians: Why didn’t their culture “develop”?The evidence shows that their arts, sciences,mathematics, technology, techniques of warfare are allthere complete from the beginning. What I want toargue here today is that the Egyptians of the pre-OldKingdom era somehow “inherited” all these arts andsciences. Then after a short “getting acquainted”period, we see the full flowering of what we call ancientEgypt ...Lecture, Daniel Jackson, Ph.D.Scottish Rite Temple4357 Wilshire BoulevardLos Angeles, California, December 1992[index-55_1.png]- 55 -Chapter 4: Anamnesis from “Soul”to MindStarHollywood is a place where they’ll pay you athousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for yoursoul. I know, because I turned down the first offeroften enough and held out for the fifty cents.- Marilyn MonroeA. AnamnesisPlato devotes his Dialogue Meno to an exposition anddemonstration of anamnesis: the faculty that, as sentientbeings have lived previously/eternally, their knowledge ofthe Forms ( neteru) - creative, organizing, and preservingPrinciples of the OU - is also permanent, recallablethrough the exercise of dialectic. Through this mentaldiscipline, the conscious mind is inspired throughprogressively more precise questioning to discard later,coarser, inaccurate concepts in favor of their pure,original substance and clarity.The key of anamnesis came down to Plato from Egyptthrough Pythagoras. As Dr. Raghavan Iyer summarizes:Thus the soul, since it is immortal and hasbeen born many times, and has seen all thingsboth here and in the other world, has learnedeverything that is. So we need not be surprised- 56 -if it can recall the knowledge of virtue oranything else which, as we see, it oncepossessed. All nature is akin, and the soul haslearned everything, so that when a man hasrecalled a single piece of knowledge--learnedit, in ordinary language--there is no reasonwhy he should not find out all the rest, if hekeeps a stout heart and does not grow weary ofthe search, for seeking and learning are in factnothing but recollection.- Plato, MenoAnamnesis is the true soul-memory, intermittentaccess to the divine wisdom within every human beingas an immortal spectator. All self-conscious monadshave known over immemorial time a vast host ofsubjects and objects, modes and forms, an ever-changing universe. Assuming a complex series of rolesas an essential part of the endless process of learning,the soul becomes captive recurrently to myriad formsof maya and moha, illusion and delusion. At the sametime the soul has the innate and inward capacity tocognize that is is more than any and all of these masks.As every incarnated being manifests a poor, palecaricature of himself - a small, self-limiting, andinverted reflection of one’s nœtic and creative potential- the ancient doctrine of anamnesis is vital tocomprehend human nature and its hidden possibilities.Given the fundamental truth that all human beingshave played many parts, initiating diverse actions inintertwined chains of causation, it necessarily followsthat everyone has the moral and material environmentfrom birth to death which is needed for self-correctionand self-education. But who is it that has this need?Not the shadowy self or false egoity which merelyreacts to external stimuli. Rather there is that Eye ofWisdom in every person which in deep sleep is fully- 57 -awake and which has a translucent awareness of self-consciousness as pure, primordial light. 27For the reader to apprehend the original Egyptiannœsis of what modernity only dimly and vaguely calls the“soul”, we will now highlight this corruption anddegeneration preliminary to jettisoning them.B. Western Religious CSURecall from Chapter #1 that human societies aregenerally not comfortable with free and independent SUs.At the conscious level, humans dislike disagreement andwish for consensus. But far less apparent and moredeadly are SU conflicts at the subconscious level, whichthreaten the prevalent and acceptable view of “reality”.Until recent centuries, control of Westerncivilization’s subconscious CSU was by institutions of thedominant religion: Judaism and its Christian and Muslimvariants. They defined “reality” and of course punished orkilled “heretics” who could or would not see this “reality”.[Anticipating Orwell’s 1984, evangelists and inquisitorssaw themselves as “saving” or “curing” unbelievers, evenif the “cure” was individual execution or “heathen”culture extermination.]27 Iyer, Raghavan, The Society of the Future.

The Judæo-Christian SoulJudaism is most significant from a CSU standpointfor its introduction of the concept of “original sin”,according to which every human begins, lives, and endshis or her life under a curse and condemnation fromJudaism’s God. This “greatest of all sins” resulted fromAdam and Eve innocently and ignorantly eating a fruit inthe Garden of Eden which gave them individual SUs:awareness of their freedom to assign meaning andevaluations of goodness and evilness according to theirown intelligence and experience, not God’s. In effect theyhad ceased to be non-conscious components of the OU,and this separation was the “greatest sin”. Implicitly theirOU-separation from their eating of the fruit was alsopassed along to all of their descendants, who similarlyinherited the same inescapable sin.Consider the effect this CSU has had upon all of thecivilizations in its grip: the entire Jewish, Christian, andMuslim world down through the centuries. Humanity istaught that it is inherently and inescapably evil, so muchso that even the most strenuous of purging and punitivelifestyles, such as monasticism, nunnery, celibacy, etc.,are futile. Only through the intercession of divine saviorssuch as Jesus Christ and Mohammed can a fortunate fewhumans hope for even posthumous relief. For everyoneelse this life is a journey of misery followed by an eternityof torture. In its original, pre-Christian “Hell” concept,ancientMesopotamians [including the Hebrews]considered the underworld ( Kur-nu-gi-a or Sheol) as adim, dismal place in which the once-incarnate souldisintegrated. Hence their approach to life was fatalisticand pessimistic, with ethics considered in terms ofEarthly consequences only.Contrast this with the culture of ancient Egypt, inwhich there was neither “original” nor “inherited” sin.- 59 -Each individual was born a blank slate, so to speak, andhad full discretion to pursue an incarnation of virtue orvice, after which, at the entrance to the Afterlife, thedeceased’s heart would be “weighed against a feather” tofairly ascertain whether pleasure or penance had beenearned.The Judaic soul, unlike anything in Egyptianm e t a p h y s i c s , w a s t h u s s o m e t h i n g s h a m e f u l ,reprehensible, and evil. What could families,communities, or nations composed of such flawed anddoomed creatures hope to accomplish? If they could notsave themselves in the greater sense, of what value wereefforts towards morality, virtue, and other behaviorssupposed to please if not placate God?It wasn’t until the late-17th/early-18th century CE“Enlightenment” that Judæo-Christianity ceased to beregarded as literal truth and became merely apropaganda tool for controlling the ignorant andsuperstitious. Thereafter, and to this day, it receivesextensive lip service and ceremony, but without theintelligentsia or even its own cadre regarding it asanything more than a fairytale. Neither God nor Jesusnor Satan is regarded as anything more than a convenientsymbolic myth.It therefore takes some effort to cast oneself back topre-Enlightenment times when all such influences wereheld to be quite real indeed, and so the determinants ofhuman actions. Once this is appreciated, the Crusades,religious wars, sect-persecutions, and “heathen”civilization exterminations are coldly understandable notas aberrations but as the God-sanctioned norm of humanconduct.The Enlightenment relegation of Judæo-Christianityfrom truth to fiction was echoed in its concept of the soul.Previously the soul had been a real, tangible object of fearand self-hatred within each human. Now that it was- 60 -eliminated, society had to develop new devices to enticeor coerce the dominant CSU. We shall survey thesedevices as they were introduced and are still used today,but before doing so, we need to clear away the remainingwreckage from the popular notion of the soul, and returnagain to Egypt for completeness and clarity.From Webster’s International Dictionary:soul: (1) The immaterial essence or substance,animating principle, or actuating cause of life or of theindividual life. (2a) The psychical or spiritual principlein general shared by or embodied in individual humanbeings or all beings having a rational and spiritualnature. (2b) The psychical or spiritual nature of theuniverse related to the physical world as the humansoul to the human body ...While a superficially-impressive attempt, thisdefinition finally falls back on empty circularity. What isan “animating principle”, and would the soul not exist if itdid not animate externalities? What is meant by“psychical” and “spiritual”? As Robert Anton Wilsonquipped in Schrödinger’s Cat: “Theology was a system forexplaining things by coining words which nobody couldunderstand and pretending that the words meantsomething.” 28D. Jewish and Christian AfterlifesWithin the Western cultural tradition it is rarelyrealized that its two major religions - Christianity andJudaism - are actually at extremes apart on this issue.Christianity in all of its many forms upholds life-after-death as reason for abstinence in “this life”. Judaism, onthe other hand, insists upon “this life only” and absolutely28 Wilson, Robert Anton, Schrödinger’s Cat. New York: PocketBooks, 1979, page #98.- 61 -rejects justification for human behavior on any groundsother than YHVH’s direct instructions to living humans.Comments Arthur Schopenhauer in Parega #I, 13:The Jewish religion proper, as described and taughtin Genesis and all the historic books until the end ofChronicles, is the crudest of all religions because it isthe only one which has no theory of immortality - noteven a trace of it. Every king and every hero or prophetis buried, when he dies, with his fathers, and there is anend of the matter; no trace of any existence after death;indeed, as if intentionally, every thought of this sortseems to have been removed.Schopenhauer is only partially correct. The ancientHebrews drew no distinction between human souls andthe animating force common to all animals ( nephesh).Although some part of this animating force was thoughtto survive the destruction of the body, it was regardedwith superstitious terror and referred to ambiguously bythe terms elohim and rephaim. By the 2nd century BCEHebrew doctrine had changed to include therevivification of the material body, but Hebrewtheologians never extended this principle to thePythagorean/Platonic concept of an independently-surviving psyche.Not surprisingly the original Christians continued thisJewish tradition of corporeal revivification, using theGreek term psyche to mean much the same thing as theHebrew nephesh. In Matthew 10:28, where the soul ismentioned as distinct from the body, their posthumousreunion is promptly suggested. The most conclusiveexample of this doctrine, of course, is that of Jesus’ ownmaterial resurrection [as in Luke 24:36-43], but by thetime of Paul the distaste with which sophisticated Greeksregarded this “animation of corpses” ( anastasis nekron)induced that apostle to modify Christian teachings in the- 62 -direction of Pythagoreanism. Paul was further aware of -and presumably sought to overcome - the challenge ofGnostic and Hermetic Christianity, being a blend of basicChristianity with various Egyptian and Hellenicmysteries. 29In I Cor. 15:35 and II Cor. 5:1-2 Paul offers a mixtureof Pythagorean and Hebrew ideas, whereby theposthumous soul is given a “spiritual body” ( somapneumatikon) which nevertheless requires a bodily form.Despite Paul’s efforts, Christianity has never succeeded inbreaking free from the notion of reanimation of theoriginal corpse, which at least has been grist for the millof horror-film producers.While there have been many explanations forChristian antipathy towards Judaism, one of the mostcrucial had todo with Jews’ failure to be posthumouslyaccountable in any way for their incarnate conduct,implying that they are self-serving and indifferent toethics. Observed Dietrich Eckart, initiate of the ThuleGesellschaft and mentor to Adolf Hitler and AlfredRosenberg, in 1919 ( Auf gut deutsch):It is now evident that a people which completelydenies the existence of life after death must limit all ofits thoughts and endeavors to the present world, toearthly existence; it has no other choice. But a peoplecan only grow up with such an emphasis on worldlymatters if it fundamentally lacks any need forimmortality, which in turn is possible only if there is notrace of feeling in its basic character for the eternal inmankind. Wherever the soul manifests itself, no matterhow faintly, a sense of immortality necessarily follows.The individual is not always consciously aware of this;indeed there are many who refuse to understand it -29 The 1945 discovery of thirteen original Gnostic codices at NagHammadi in Upper Egypt has shed much light on the ideas withwhich Paul had to compete. The codices themselves date to 350-400CE but are probably copies of 2nd century CE originals.- 63 -who are so ignorant concerning the concept ofimmortality that they habitually denounce it, evenwhile their unselfish actions clearly reveal that eachone of them senses the soul and therefore eternitywithin himself.Although Pauline Christianity attempted toappropriate the Pythagorean/Platonic concept of the“soul distinct within and ultimately freed from the body”,it was unable to sustain this concept without the vehicleof the body. Christian artistic representations ofposthumous Paradise are invariably sterile and dull. Itwill be recalled that Christ’s ultimate promise upon hisSecond Coming was to reunite all souls with their ex-bodies, so that they would once again enjoy their originalcorporeal shells.- 64 -[index-65_1.png]- 65 -Chapter 5: Anamnesis MindStarYou have left your body; be aware if you care.Your mind has left your body, and for this one momentYou are under the polar ice cap in a place we call home.How is it there, white bear, like that where you grow?Now all of you come back to here, and now elsewhen tothere.Move on out the other way where...Do you find yourself floating, growing there?You can exercise your mind on where you want to go,And you can see the city lights flashing two thousand milesbelow you.You can feel the sands of Zanzibar or pierce the nearest sun;Find out what and who you are and if you need to run.There is one moment in your life, and it can come at anytime,And you remember all of what went onFrom the instant you were born through your early years.And if you can fasten on that moment and expand throughthe afterglow,You can reverse your mind in time and travel back to whenThe Earth was formed, the sky was born, and the universebegan.You have left your body; return when you may.Save it for another day - beyond you.- Paul Kantner, Your Mind Has Left Your Body[index-66_1.png]- 66 -A. MindStarHow then can each soul find and see itself, since it is asingularity which each individual cannot “get outside of”?This harks back to philosophers such as Descartes, whosought, one might say Quixotically, to “prove” theirconscious existence. “Proof” is of necessity external, asdiscussed above, so Descartes’ famous Cogito Ergo Sum(I think, therefore I am) is futile: It is impossible todescribe a “thought” which is not the composite ofexternal sensory input.No, conceptual thought (Kant’s “pure reason”, Plato’snœsis, Nietzsche’s “horizon building”) begins from thepure, unsupported apprehension of one’s conscious selfas an existential reality: the ba of ancient Egypt, thepsyche of the Greeks, the Golden Flower of the Tao, thesoul of Judæo-Christianity, identifying, in the words ofDr. Raghavan Iyer, “... not the shadowy self or false egoitywhich merely reacts to external stimuli. Rather there isthat Eye of Wisdom in every person which in deep sleepis fully awake and which has a translucent awareness ofself-consciousness as pure, primordial light.”Indeed as this “pure, primordial light” is brought fullyinto focus, none of the above labels seems completelyadequate or accurate. Some, like Kant’s and Nietzsche’s,address expression rather than essence. The Egyptianrealization of the complete essence was multifold: notlimited to the ba. For this discussion, therefore, I proposea fresh term, inspired by Dr. Iyer’s sublime descriptionabove:- 67 -... being the self-contained, self-sustaining concentrationof essence which exists as the core of the conscious mind.This new term not only frees us from the limitations andpreconceptualizations of old labels; it is a constantreminder that the present examination is a fresh,evolutionary one in which we cannot be content to coaston inaccurate or inadequate myths or stereotypes.Thus emboldened, therefore, let us return toanamnesis to address the question of the MindStar’sability to interact with a temporary physical body whilenot itself containing any element of the OU. [Inconventional conversation this is often referred to as the“mind/body problem”.] The key we bring to this lock isthat of fields.B. Fields1. DefinitionWhat exactly is a “field”? When something occurssomewhere in the OU because something else happenssomewhere else in the OU, by no detectible means bywhich the cause produces the effect, the two events aresaid to be connected by a “field” [well-known examplesbeing gravity and magnetism].Understandably OU scientists don’t like fields. To theextent they remain fields in defiance of all attempts toconnect their events, they are inconvenient and annoyingrefutations of one of the most sacred OU cows: the law ofcause and effect. Science’s fallback excuse is that the lawmust apply to every field phenomenon too; the mediumjust hasn’t been discovered yet. Sometimes, even moredesperately, scientists hypothesize completely fantastic“missing links”, such as “gravitons”, to emulate RobertAnton Wilson’s amusing explanation of conventionalreligious jargon. Leaving both scientists and theologians- 68 -thrashing about in this terminological quicksand, let usproceed to a very special type of field: that integral withthehuman body.2. Life-FieldsThe human body is an electromagnetic machine. Assuch it both generates and is enveloped byelectromagnetic fields (EMF), controlling everythingfrom heartbeat and respiration to sleep and femalemenstrual cycles.To understand the significance of EMFs to the humanbody, it is first necessary to appreciate that each suchbody is not an inert, static clump of permanent matter. Itis rather an organic complex in a constant state ofreorganization and reconstitution. For instance, humanliver and serum proteins are replaced every 10 days, andthe whole of the proteins in the body about every 160days. Moreover these protein molecules are extremelycomplex devices, not mere raw material; not even a singleamino acid can be out of place in the replacement.To put it another way, there are about 60 thousandbillion cells in the human body, and every day about 500billion of these die and are replaced and rebuilt.Why? One possibility is that these molecules are socomplex that they are inherently unstable and thus arecontinuously deteriorating. The metabolic system,including the liquid-based transmission of food and rawmaterial throughout the body, is a raging furnace ofconsumption and regeneration.How does the body know precisely how to recreateeach cell and molecule? It cannot be within the objectitself, because an object cannot “organize itself”.The answer lies in the existence of an entire layerednetwork of EMFs throughout and within the body,altogether comprising a “master plan” EMF for it. Dr.- 69 -Harold Saxon Burr, Professor Emeritus of Anatomy, YaleSchool of Medicine, named this the L-Field (for “Life-Field”/LF). 30In the case of the human body, its organizing systemcannot be chemical, because then that system itself wouldbe subject to the same entropic process. Hence there ismore to a human being than mere chemistry. It requiresan organizing field, not merely an accidentalaccumulation of proteins; thus the notion of “generandomness” is invalid.3. TelosOrganization inherently requires preconceptionbased upon purpose. Conventional academic doctrine isthat living beings’ purpose is selectively the result ofenvironmental survival needs: Darwinian “naturalselection”: There is no inherent purpose to life-formsbeyond passive/reactive survival, avoidance of pain,seeking of pleasure, and instinct to reproduce.Prior to Darwin’s theory of passive natural selection,the French biologist Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829),while not denying such passive evolution, augmented itwith what he termed “soft evolution” (in modern parlance“Lamarckism”). According to this theory, characteristicsdeveloped or acquired by a given living being can beinherited by its progeny, thus adding the element ofintentional purpose to evolution.If Lamarckism is allowed to operate according tohuman intellectual will, of course, then the principle ofpurpose on the individual human scale is established.This in turn suggests that there may be a greater elementof purpose above and beyond the individual.30 Burr, Dr. Harold Saxon, The Fields of Life: Our Links with theUniverse. NY: Ballantine Books #23559, 1972.- 70 -While heretical to the Darwinian establishment, sucha master-principle of purpose was neither unknown norrepugnant to the ancients, who by the time it had reachedGreece from Egypt referred to it as telos.Teleology is the doctrine that final causes ofphenomena exist. Further that purpose and design are apart of or are apparent in nature. Further thatphenomena are not only guided by mechanical forces(e.g. passive natural seletion), but also move towardscertain goals of self-realization.The opposite of teleology is mechanism, whichdescribes phenomena in terms of prior causes instead oftheir presumed destination or fulfillment. [Modernscience is thus mechanistic.]The existence of Life-Fields establishes that humanityis teleological, not mechanistic, in its physical design anddevelopment. The species is not a “random OU accident”just stumbling onward through equally-haphazard“survival of the fittest”. This simple and obvious truth isshattering to mechanistic science, because it inevitablymandates an intelligence establishing and guiding thetelos: the Egyptian neteru, Pythagorean/Platonic Forms,or in vulgar simplification “gods/God”.But the scientists’ teleological nightmare gets worse[or better, depending upon one’s point of view] ...4. Thought-FieldsAs it turns out, human thought also has the propertiesof a field. While Dr. Burr was conducting his 40 years ofresearch regarding what would eventually emerge as L-Fields, other academicians were examining mentalactivity and discovering that it too does not behave as a“linear machine” [as, for instance, electronic computers- 71 -running programs of “artificial intelligence”]. 31 Amongthese findings:(1) Memory is not localized in the brain, exceptwhere it is connected to a very immediate,specific, and continuous sensory function(e.g. perception of heat). Destroying select,even major areas of the brain does not havea traceable effect upon the general memoryfunction; other parts of the brain simply“take over”, and even appear to be re-learning and re-refining supposedly-excisedm e m o r i e s . I f t h e s o u r c e f o r s u c hreacquisition is not physical, then it defaultsto a field phenomenon.(2) Access to memories is also non-linear. Onemay forget what one had for dinner theprevious evening, while having a crystal-clear recall of information/imagery decadespreviously. The process by which memoriesare so assorted [as it is a grey-scalespectrum, not an either/or action] remainsunknown.(3) Memory access is instantaneous, its age orcomplexity notwithstanding. This again isnon-linear, as computers must go through31 Dr. Harold Saxon Burr’s L-Field research was summed up in hisThe Fields of Life: Our Links with the Universe (NY: BallantineBooks #23559, 1972). The first collection of research extending this“fields” concept to thought was Design for Destiny by Edward W.Russell (NY: Ballantine Books #23405, 1971). Russell was a formernewspaper reporter with an interest in speculative science. While it isadmittedly hypothetical, Russell does a commendable and exhaustivejob of identifying and citing both scientific and philosophical sources.- 72 -selection/exclusion sequences to answermemory-questions.(4) As Plato illustrated in the Meno, theunderlying basis of all knowledge - theprimal building-blocks upon which learningand reasoning depend for their accuracyand coherence - are inherent to eachincarnate intelligence: anamnesis -“recollective awareness of the neteru/Forms”. In non-metaphysical terms,humans know “instinctively” whether theyare thinking reasonably and with validity.[This is not the same thing, obviously, asprocessing thoughts on the basis of invalidinformation.]Of course much of what humans know as day-to-daythought is [at least assumed as] linear [the precise termbeing “algorithmic”]. Human brains coast through eachday largely on sensory stimulus/response “autopilot”,about 95% of which is subconscious. If the avalanche ofdaily sensory data had to be dealt with consciously,anything resembling normal human activity would bequite impossible.As with Dr. Burr’s L-Fields, Mr. Russell’s “T-Fields”met with something less than thunderous enthusiasm inestablished/conventional scientific circles. It was badenough for Burr to discover an external and purposefulintelligence behind human OU/bodily organization andevolution. It was far worse for the most essentialelements of individual human presence-of-mind to becompletely removed from the physical brain. In thisdevastating one/two blow, Darwinian mechanism hadbeen completely exploded, with the terrible spectres of“intelligent design” and a metaphysical “soul” returning- 73 -[absent Judæo-Christian trappings] from their post-Enlightenment banishment.As these [re]discoveries could not be invalidated ordiscredited, they met with the academic establishment’sfallback response: they were simply and persistentlyignored.Except, of course, here.C. Egyptian MindStar EmanationsTo this point we have first cleared away theconventional religious and materialistic wreckage fromthe popular concept of the “soul”, and established boththe metaphysical existence of the MindStar (MS) and itsmeans of interaction with the OU brain and body.We are now in a position to identify the elements or“emanations” of the MS as the Egyptians apprehendedthem. This is thus the “core” of this book, but it cannot beoveremphasized that this is not a mere recitation for thereader’s bemusement. It is a doorway, a map, by whichthe individual can redirect the power of discretionaryconsciousness to its source, purification, and realizationof immortality.Each of the following eight emanations proceeds fromthe [more] OU-linked to the [more] SU-linked.Predictably this makes the more basic ones that mucheasier to identify based on their familiar, if subconsciousOU-usage. A comparison may be made to Plato’s“pyramid of thought”, which in his Dialogues he stratifiedas Eikasia (primitive emotion), Pistis (ordinary active/reactive thinking), Dianoia (precise, logical, enlightenedthought), and Nœsis (intuition and apprehension of theUltimate Good ( Agathon).The Egyptian priesthoods knew that each livingcreature was possessed of several existence-emanationsabove and beyond the metabolic mind/body. All sentient- 74 -beings possess the first four ( khat, ren, khabit, ab).Beings endowed with the Gift of Set (awareness of isolateself-consciousness) the next two ( ba, ka) as well as inthose of initiatory capacity and attainment the next one( sekhem), and in unique instances the ultimate one ( akh).Accordingly each of the following expositions is meantnot just as something to be read, but as a personalapplication exercise. Upon being alerted to eachemanation, redirect your thought “inward” until you findand recognize it in yourself. You may be surprised at howeffortless this is. [As effortless and self-evident, indeed, asall of the “great truths” presented in MindStar, each ofwhich you find, perhaps to your surprise, that you “knowalready”. Welcome to anamnesis.] It is a gateway, a mapto your personal Grail Castle. Once you know that it existsand is there to be quested and found, you have only to:Descende, audas viator, et terrestre centrumattinges. Kod feci.Descend, audacious traveler, and you will reachthe center of the Earth. I did it.Arne Saknussemm, inJules Verne,Journey to the Center of the Earth, 18641. KhatThe body-emanation. The khat is integral with thebeing’s physical body, and is the original of what later,lesser cultures would represent as the “energy body”,“body of light”, “astral body”, etc. In current field theoryit constitutes the life-field of the person, controlling anddirecting its material counterpart’s organization,regeneration, and span of existence. During physical lifeit is coextensive with its material counterpart. Aftermaterial death it may remain with the corpse to serve as amedium for the other emanations, or it may merely lingernear its remains. Jungians perceived the khat as the- 75 -“earthbound” anima, and in the oriental vision of theGolden Flower it was known as the kuei:Tao the undivided, Great One, gives rise to twoopposite reality principles, Darkness and Light, yin andyang. These are at first thought of only as forces ofnature apart from man. Later the sexual polarities, andothers as well, are derived from them. From yin comesK’un, the receptive feminine principle; from yangcomes Ch’ien, the creative masculine principle. Fromyin comes ming (life); from yang comes hsing(essence).Each individual contains a central monad which, atthe moment of conception, splits into life and essence( ming and hsing). These two are super-individualprinciples and so can be related to eros and logos.In the personal bodily existence of the individualthey are represented by two other polarities, a p’o soul(or anima) and a hun soul (or animus). All during thelife of the individual these two are in conflict, eachstriving for mastery. At death they separate and godifferent ways. The anima sinks to earth as kuei, aghost-being. 32It is the khat which is drawn into or activated fromwithin a corpse in necromantic magical workings. As the32 The Secret of the Golden Flower by Richard Wilhelm (Trans)(London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1931.

Cf. also a more recent translation byThomas Cleary (San Francisco: HarperSan Francisco, 1991).- 76 -reader may surmise, the khat is also the vehicle for thezombie practices of Voodoo. 332. RenThe name-emanation. The Egyptians understoodthe power of names to identify, define, protect, andempower individuals - most conspicuously in the variousnames taken by each pharaoh. Collectively and separatelyeach name affected the very essence of the person, andthe greatest curse [as also illustrated in literature andfilm] was to be denied all names. 34 Externally a name canbe used to summon or compel, whether physicallyincarnate or not. The neteru also have the power and thediscretion to give names as well as take them, andthrough such names to take form and voice.33 For details of zombification see Wade E. Davis , The Serpent andthe Rainbow (New York: Warner Books, 1987), concerning HaitianVoodoo and actual zombie creation - not by supernatural means, butby the secret use of poisons. The book is based upon field research bythe author, who holds undergraduate degrees from HarvardUniversity in Ethnobotany and Biology, and a Ph.D. in Ethnobotany.34 For example, in Bram Stoker’s The Jewel of Seven Stars, theEgyptian priests who sought to prevent the feared sorceress-QueenTera from returning to incarnate life attempted to destroy allinscriptions of her name in her tomb, as well as in other references toher. [They failed.]In H.P. Lovecraft’s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, the nameand all references to the Colonial sorcerer Joseph Curwen weretracked down and obliterated by the vigilantes who murdered him.Elsewhere in exoteric history it was a common practice forEgyptian pharaohs and priesthoods to attempt to deface or erase thenames, images, and monuments of feared or hated predecessors,such as the “heretic” Akhenaten.- 77 -3. KhabitThe shadow-emanation. This is the connection ofthe still-incarnate khat with the life-forces of the naturalneteru, enabling it to function as the organizing andcontrolling energy (the individual “life-field”). If thekhabit is destroyed, the life-field de-energizes and thephysical body expires. In Black Magic the khabit can alsobe sent out by its owner as an instrument of influenceupon others.After the physical body is destroyed or no longerneeded, the khabit becomes an avatar of the neterAnubis, overseeing guidance of the [noninitiate]consciousness through the incoherence of the Tuat intothe stabilization of Amenti. An initiated consciousnessneeds no such guidance.4. AbThe heart-emanation. The physical locus ofindividual identity and consciousness, hence the bridgebetween the OU of the neteru and the SU of the fourmetaphysical emanations. It is through the ab that anindividual realizes and recognizes incarnate identity anduniqueness, and following destruction/expiration of one’sbody it is through the ab that one can reenter the OU [asa “ghost”, through “possession” (more precisely mergerwith another, incarnate ab), or through thought-transference].It is also in the ab that the strength and quality ofone’s maat (inclination to “good” or “evil”) reposes. Thisis echoed in the later Indian mythologies of karma, andwas the reason for the posthumous “weighing of the heartagainst a feather” in Egypt. After bodily death the maatwithin the ab overwhelms it completely, so that anysubsequent manifestation in the OU is likely to be an- 78 -extreme concentration of either beneficence ormalevolence.5. BaThe core-emanation. This is each sentient being’ssense of self-awareness, of unique and absolutedistinction from everything else (both other sentientbeings and the entire OU). Thus it is the manifestation, orGift, of Set, the neter of non-nature, in each so-consciousentity.The ba becomes stronger through increased self-exploration and -realization: the initiatory process ofXeper. Unlike natural initiation, which draws theindividual into alignment, harmony, and ultimatelyconscious absorption into and indistinction from one ormore of the natural neteru, Xeper of the ba does notdissolve the self into Set, but attains and sustains acohesive essence of its own.The anamnesis or “remembered knowledge”experienced by the slave boy in Plato’s Meno is perhapsmore accurately described as the physical-process,stimulus/response brain reaching in to the ba for bits ofits immortal, eternal wisdom. But this is akin to reachingfor a coal in a hot fire. It is stressful to do, and the resultcan be held only for a fleeting moment without furtherstress. The superficial/physical “self”, which throughmaterial “hits” continuously reassures itself that it is theonly self, is shaken by exposure to its falseness, itsnothingness. It backs away from such “close encounters”,dismisses them as “illusions”, “fantasy”, “imagination”,etc., and hastens to rebuild its fortress of material-sensation walls.Absent Setian orientation and initiation, a ba simplycontinues as one’s sense of identity, thus the “essentialself” around which all of the other souls coalesce and- 79 -recognize themselves. Within noninitiates this results inthe ba being sensed as a dreamy, meditative “state ofbeing” which, if indulged in with persistence andintensity, leads to its overwhelming the other souls, hence“nirvana” and similar states of ba-ecstasy.6. KaThe transmigration-emanation. The ka is thecomplete mirror-image of all eight natural and non-natural emanations, fused into an avatar, Doppelgänger,or Horla, a completely metaphysical remanifestation ofoneself which can exist and displace without limit, bothwithin the non-natural universe generated by one’s baand within the physical universe of the natural neteru aswell.It is the ka that, through the ab, enters the naturaluniverse through “identity gates” such as pictures orstatues of the individual, or utterance of the individual’sname(s) (the ren), as well as through conducive localessuch as temples and geological & architectural anomalies.While the ba may, particularly posthumously, loseawareness of itself through the paradoxical expansion ofthat consciousness into its entire perceptive field, the karemains immortally finite, distinct, and otherness-separate. Thus in an expressive, active sense it becomesthe externally-identifiable individual beyond physicaldeath.Nowhere is the ka better illustrated than in initiateBram Stoker’s The Jewel of Seven Stars. Film treatmentsof this work, such as Hammer’s Blood from the Mummy’sTomb and the more recent The Awakening, have done ita grotesque disservice. In Stoker’s original text it is in nosense a horror story, but rather a fascinating andromantic mystery: Who was Tera of ancient Egypt, thismarvelous sorceress-queen who took with her to her- 80 -tomb only a ruby scarab inscribed with the constellationof the Thigh of Set (our “Great Bear”) and the hieroglyphsmer (love) and men ab (patience)? Listen to the words ofthe woman of our own era with whose ka Tera camegently to merge:I can see her in her loneliness and in the silence ofher mighty pride, dreaming her own dream of thingsfar different from those around her. Of some otherland, far away under the canopy of the silent night, litby the cool, beautiful light of the stars. A land underthat Northern star, whence blew the sweet winds thatcooled the feverish desert air. A land of wholesomegreenery, far, far away. Where were no scheming andmalignant priesthood; whose ideas were to lead topower through gloomy temples and more gloomycaverns of the dead, through an endless ritual of death!A land where love was not base, but a divine possessionof the soul! Where there might be some one kindredspirit which could speak to hers through mortal lipslike her own; whose being could merge with hers in asweet communion of soul to soul, even as their breathscould mingle in the ambient air! I know the feeling, forI have shared it myself. I may speak of it now, since theblessing has come into my own life. I may speak of itsince it enables me to interpret the feelings, the verylonging soul, of that sweet and lovely Queen, sodifferent from her surroundings, so high above hertime! Whose nature, put into a word, could control theforces of the Under World; and the name of whoseaspiration, though but graven on a star-lit jewel, couldcommand all the powers in the Pantheon of the HighGods. And in the realisation of that dream she willsurely be content to rest!In Love and Patience we are taught the secret of trueimmortality - not the repulsive reanimation of corpses( anastasis nekron) of Christianity, nor the vagueconfusion of reincarnationists - but the infinite radiance- 81 -of one’s MS by its most magnificent expression, and witha serene transcendence of natural time.The last two souls are unique in that they must arisefrom the individual, and require initiate consciousness todo so, per the formula Xepera Xeper Xeperu (“I HaveCome Into Being and Created That Which Has Come IntoBeing.”).7. SekhemThe neter-emanation. While the term sekhem isordinarily translated as “power”, this is misleading,because it is power in a very rarified sense - thatemanating from the neteru themselves. For this reason itis also described as “the power of the stars” throughwhich the neteru manifest in the natural universe. Thesekhem combines with the ab (as, in effect, a templewithin one’s consciousness), to draw down the essence ofone or more adored neteru to indwell therein.Activation of the sekhem has another effect: everyincidence infuses the Initiate with more of the neterinvoked, to the cumulative degree that the Initiate’spersonality becomes accented by the neter’s: seeing asthat neter sees, speaking as that neter would speak,acting as that neter would act. Hence it is the sekhemwhich makes possible, and ultimately consecratespriesthood of a neter in the individual so aligned. Oncethis transformation has taken place, it cannot be undone;at most it may be sublimated or repressed, but only atgreat cost to the priest’s or priestess’ very sanity.8. AkhThe star-emanation. Beyond the priesthood of thesekhem is the akh, in which the Initiate rises to thecompany of the neteru as one of their essence, if not of- 82 -them absolutely. Such one is indistinguishable from theactual neteru except by the neteru themselves. Such amode of existence departs completely from all concernwith physical displacement within natural-universalreferences or boundaries, manifestation, or action, andaffects otherness only by the radiance of its presence.While it does not destroy any of the other emanations, itpermeates all of them, such that henceforth they all existin conformity and concert with it.9. Conventionalist BlindersWhat conventional Egyptology calls the “Egyptiansoul” varies from three to eleven “parts” taken arbitrarilyfrom the multitude of Old & New Kingdom magical andfunerary texts favored by the Egyptologist offering his“translation”. What quickly becomes commonly evident isthat these treat the entire subject, as indeed the rest ofEgyptian metaphysics, as nothing more than a primitivefairytale: an entertaining curiosity but certainly nothingto take seriously or apply as a key to reality. Only fromthe Symbolists, who do not make the fatal mistake ofregarding hieroglyphs as nothing more than an alphabet,can the modern mind move, as herein, beyond thesuperficial and “quaintly silly” to the authenticallyexperiential: the apprehension of the true, immortal, andeternal MS. All one need do is to focus one’s consciouspast the physical-sensory prison of the khat.As you seek and find each emanation, you will realizeit suprarationally, beyond the limitations of khat-realm alphabetics. Expect this; don’t make the mistake ofdismissing it as “mere imagination”. You are unlocking afar greater reality, not merely corrupting the most crudeand confining physical-sensory illusion of it.[index-83_1.png]- 83 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6: MINDSTAR ACTIVITY... And travellers now within that valley,Through the red-litten windows seeVast forms that move fantasticallyTo a discordant melody;While, like a rapid ghastly river,Through the pale door;A hideous throng rush out forever,And laugh - but smile no more.- Edgar Allan PoeThe Fall of the House of UsherA. Metaphysical EvidenceTo this point we have discarded inaccurate andincoherent representations of the “soul”, discussed how apurely-metaphysical locus of conscious existence (MS)can interact with an incarnate body in the OU throughfield functionality, and returned through anamnesis tothe original Egyptian MS emanations.Within its familiar realm of OU-studies, physicalscience identifies and classifies phenomena, the naturallaws governing them, through observation and repeat-experimentation (the “scientific method”).How can the purely-metaphysical MS be similarlyverified and “tracked” if it cannot be compared andcontrasted to anything besides itself? The answer is that- 84 -if incarnate humans cannot “see” the MS through any OUmedium, they can accomplish the same identification andvalidation by looking at its “reflection”: its activity in thecourse of both individual and group events.Once again the ancient Greeks, after their Egyptiansages, had a word for this MS “footprint”, and it is:B. LogosThe Greeks saw the OU divided into a non-conscious,automatic functioning ( physis) conceived andimplemented by a divine intelligence and consciousness( logos). The individual human intelligence ( nous) wascapable of coherent recognition and application of thelogos; each human was thus a microcosm of themacrocosmic logos. As Raghavan Iyer relates:In classical Greece the term nomos had to do withmeasure. As early as Sophocles, agraphos nomos, theunwritten law, had divine sanction, and with the laterStoics it was grounded in nature ( physis) as theimmanent logos.Nous for Anaxagoras was both a cosmologicalprinciple as the source of all motion, and an immanentprinciple in all living beings.Diogenes qualified the principle, which hedenominated ær-nous, by replacing mechanisticinterpretations with the view that its activity isintelligent and forms the best possible kosmos, and it isexpressed in the operation of a principle of measureamong all things.In the later writings of Plato kosmos nœtos, theintelligible universe, is both produced and ordered bynous, which is inherent in all men.Plotinus drew the implication that nous istranscendent as the cause of kosmos nœtos and isimmanent in human beings, each of whom is thereforea kosmos nœtos.- 85 -The Stoics concluded that the human nous is amanifestation of cosmic nous.Nous represents a binding-together of humanminds as rays from one central source of cosmicintelligence. 35Thus the logos may be described as the field whichenables the human intelligent consciousness ( nous) totranscend the OU ( physis) and come into its divine beingas the MS.As the human MS energizes and is energized by thelogos, it radiates its existence in both an active and apassive way.The active radiation, well-known to the Egyptians butnot so clear to the Greeks, is Xeper (hieroglyphic Xpr). Itis sensed by the individual experiencing it, but isinherently difficult for others to perceive because it isconstantly remanifesting and enhancing the nous inquestion. It is unique and unpredictable in eachindividual, so the most that others may sense is thatsomething involved with the logos is transforming thatindividual beyond the known and familiar.The passive “footprint” of humanity’s encounter withthe logos is more easily seen by the intellectual andemotional reactions it has engendered throughout thecourse of history. One might suppose it to be a desirable,exhilarating experience, but remarkably this has not beenthe case. Failing to understand the divine dimension ofthe logos, humans have more often than not reacted to itspresence in them with confusion and fear. Thisuncertainty has not focused on the logos as a uniqueprinciple, but rather upon its presumed purpose ( telos).This has coalesced into extremes of absolute discretion(or “free will”) vs. predestination (or “mechanization”).35 Iyer, Raghavan, Parapolitics: Toward the City of Man. New York:Oxford University Press, 1979, pages #54-55.- 86 -C. The Telos of LogosThe scope and discretion of the consciousness, theGreeks contended, evidenced that each living being soendowed was far more than a mere survival, gratification,and reproduction mechanism. The self-aware mind( nous) extends far beyond this, indeed far beyond thediscernible limits of the natural environment itself( physis). There was of necessity a purpose to thisexistence greater than the natural, whether divinely orindividually inspired ( logos). In individual humans theEgyptians knew it as Xeper: the ever-expanding,evolutionary assertion of being. In Greece it was soughtas telos - usually translated as “purpose” but referring notto mere convenience or application, but to a being’s,object’s, or process’ metaphysical fulfillment. Thus Xeperor telos was not always readily apparent; it was aprofound, hidden magic which only the enlightenedconsciousness could come to recognize and appreciate(again, the logos).Of the two terms, Xeper was by far the more elusive,since it varied infinitely between particularizations,especially conscious beings. Telos was less multifaceted,looking for recognizable, predictable features in things oreven beings of an apparent relationship. Thus telos couldbe ascertained through methodical, enlighteneddiscovery: the dialectic. (exemplified by Plato’sDialogues). Xeper, on the other hand, does not pre-existsuch as to be discoverable through examination; it isspontaneous and unique to each entity. Otherenlightened intellects accordingly can sense it in itsmanifestation only.Thus while Xeper reveals no “map” or “program of itsunfolding, as it unfolds and expands it creates a- 87 -progressively more identifiable “trail” or “mirror” of itselfto the perceptive onlooker: its telos.Again, telos refers to the “end” of a particular thing -its most functional, efficient, and effective object in themanifestation of its existence. Happiness and harmonylie in discovering that end or activity for which a being orthing is most precisely suited, then concentrating on thattelos.Accordingly an initiate activating and maximizing hispersonal Xeper should pay close attention to itsprogressive revelation of telos, so that he does not expendtime or energy wastefully. 36It is relatively easy to establish the telos of a pencil ora table, and even of most natural animals. Humanity,however, is another story altogether. Indeed once one issensitive to this principle, much of human history isrevealed to consist of confused and even violentarguments and contests concerning it - thoughnoninitiates never see their irreconciliations through thislens.D. Historical Non- Telos: Free WillAs we have seen, Plato was a proponent of teleology:the doctrine that final causes of phenomena exist.Further that purpose and design ( logos) are a part of orare apparent in nature. Further that phenomena are notonly guided by mechanical forces ( physis), but also movetowards certain goals of self-realization.36 The [in]famous British mystic and magician Aleister Crowley iswell-known for his admonition: “Do What Thou Wilt shall be thewhole of the Law.” - which most assume to mean simply “dowhatever you want”. In fact he meant that one should first discoverone’s telos, then concentrate upon its fulfillment. “... Thou hast noright but to do thy will.” - Liber L #I-42- 88 -The opposite of teleology is mechanism, whichdescribes phenomena in terms of prior causes instead oftheir presumed destination or fulfillment. [Modernscience is thus mechanistic.]Mechanism may be further divided into “free will” vs.“determinism” subcategories.Free-will advocates say that humanity is completelydiscretionary: that people are free do whatever they wantor allow one another to do, with no “higher standard” ofany sort involved beyond social consensus. Suchadvocates tend to be religious atheists, and in theirsocietal extreme are inclined to anarchism. This positionultimately demands a fallback to strict materialism,including the denial of anything metaphysical inhumanity. Thus there is no “soul”; humans are merestimulus/response machines.1. SophismThe roots of this cold utilitarianism may be tracedback to 5th century BCE Greece, where the metaphysicalconcepts espoused by Pythagoras and Plato were rejectedby a school of thought called Sophism. The Sophists,most prominent of whom was Protagoras (c.490-420BCE), maintained that “man is the measure of all things”,a contention which Plato sought to refute in hisRepublic. 37 To do so, Plato’s Socrates had finally to fall back on anothermetaphysical concept: nœsis, asuprarational apprehension of the ultimate Good( Agathon) and humanity’s inclination thereto.Unsurprisingly this argument did not commend itself tonon-initiated minds unable to make sense of nœsis, sothe principles of sophism continued into such derivative37 The complete statement attributed to Protagoras is: \"Of all thingsthe measure is man, of the things that are, that they are, and of thethings that are not, that they are not.\"(DK 80B1)- 89 -Hellenistic variations as Skepticism, Epicureanism,Stoicism, and Cynicism.2. SkepticismSkepticism, introduced by Pyrrho of Elis (360-270BCE) and Timon of the Platonic Academy in Athens(320-230 BCE), may be defined as the doctrine that anytrue knowledge is impossible, or that all knowledge isuncertain - a position that no fact or truth can beestablished on philosophical grounds.If nothing can be conclusively known, argues theSkeptic, then virtue lies in avoidance of judgment andthus of action. Beyond the individual, the community( polis) is something to be reluctantly endured forwhatever relief from negative values it offers. It is not apositive thing in itself.In many ways Skepticism may be considered a“clever” parody of the Socratic method. Socrates,however, used a Skeptical approach towards knowledgeas a “clearing away the mental underbrush” device inorder to better employ logic. The Skeptics did not pursuea similarly positive, constructive approach to theacquisition of knowledge.3. EpicureanismEpicureanism was a philosophy of hedonistic ethicsthat considered calmness untroubled by mental oremotional disquiet the highest good, held intellectualpleasures superior to others, and advocated therenunciation of momentary gratification in favor of morepermanent pleasures. It was introduced by [and namedafter] Epicurus of Samos (341-270 BCE), and it enjoyedconsiderable influence among the Greek civilizations ofthe Asiatic coasts.- 90 -Epicurus, a pantheist who rejected conventionalreligion, felt that the aim of philosophy should be to freehumanity from fear of the gods, who, if they exist, are tooremote to concern themselves with human fortunes. Herejected metaphysics, holding that humans can knownothing of the suprasensual world. Reason, he said, mustaccept the evidence of the senses. Epicurus consideredmankind a completely natural product - and mind onlyanother kind of matter. The soul can feel or act only bymeans of the body, he maintained, and it dies with thebody's death.Accordingly Epicurus considered virtue to be not anend in itself, but rather the means toward happiness. Herecommended the simple, non-envious life of the countrypeasant. “Everything natural is easily procured, and onlythe useless is costly.” “Desires may be ignored when ourfailure to accomplish them will not really cause us pain.”Epicureanism thinks of happiness in a negativefashion, i.e. freedom from pain. It considers wisdom asan escape from the hazards and problems of life. It is anice philosophy for one able to pursue it, but few are. Anentire polis of Epicureans, to be sure, would cease tofunction beyond Homer’s mythical Land of the Lotus-Eaters.4. StoicismStoicism was a philosophical system holding that it isman's duty to freely conform to natural law and hisdestiny, that virtue is the highest good, and that the wiseman should be free from passion, equally unperturbed byjoy or grief. First introduced by Zeno, a somewhatmysterious Phœnician/Egyptian (336-264 BCE), it waslater espoused by Chrysippus, Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus,and Marcus Aurelius of Rome.- 91 -Stoicism too was pantheistic: The world is theembodiment of and is governed by the LogosSpermatikos (seminal reason). All the OU is essentiallyone, but matter is dynamic. The OU goes through cyclesof expansion and contraction, development anddissolution. “God” is this entire process, not a being apartfrom it. He is the “soul” of the OU, so to speak. Man is amicrocosm of the OU. When he dies, his soul survivesdeath as an impersonal energy. Ultimately this will bereabsorbed into the OU energy.Stoics denied the Skeptical contention that noobjective knowledge is possible, holding rather that awise man can distinguish reliable impressions( kataleptika phantasia = “grasping impressions”) fromethereal ones. Hence the Stoics thought it possible toidentify the OU as a single, integrated substance in whichhuman existence and behavior partake. Knowledge arisesthrough the senses, which are also the final test of truth.Experience does not always lead to knowledge, forperceptions may be distorted by passion and/or emotion.Reason is the supreme achievement of humanity.Since humanity is integral with the OU, goodness iscooperation with nature. It is not the pursuit of pleasure,which would subordinate reason to passion. If evil comesto the good man, it is only temporary and not really evil,since in the greater sense it is natural. The Stoic thusaccepts all fortunes and misfortunes of life calmly. Heseeks an absence of feeling in his thoughts and conduct.Nevertheless Stoicism does not excuse all events asdeterministic. The individual is still responsible forvirtuous or vicious choices, measured against a naturalapproximation. The Stoic considers the “average man” adangerous fool governed by passions and emotions ratherthan by virtue and reason. The Stoic disapproves of warand slavery, and believes in humanitarianism andequality of all humans as elements of nature. But he does- 92 -not advocate violent social revolutions or drastic policiesto attain these ends. Change must come “naturally”, notartificially. Stoics sought harmony in society, which -unlike Epicureans - they acknowledged as natural. TheStoic ideal was a “world society” ( cosmopolis)transcending regional divisions: one of Alexander's goalsfor his empire.5. CynicismA variant on Stoicism was the early Cynicism ofAntisthenes (444-365 BCE) and Diogenes (d. 323 BCE),who advocated a rejection of worldly goods andinvolvement and a concentration on virtue as the onlyworthy goal. Cynicism's simple opportunism - takingwhat life offers, for better or worse - was eventuallyabsorbed into the ethical posture of Stoicism.6. ScholasticismDuring the Christian Medieval and Renaissanceperiods of European history, “free will” was condemned,indeed literally demonized as the disastrous consequenceof Satan’s temptation of Adam and Eve in the Garden ofEden to acquire it by eating the fruit of its forbiddentree. 38Hence virtue and right-conduct during this era werestrictly decreed to be found in unquestioned adherence tothe post-Eden laws of God, and all that sinful humanitycould do was to learn and obey them.38 That God had placed the tree there and given his human creaturesnot even a hint of the dire consequences not just to them but to theentire human race to follow them was and still is judiciously ignoredby Judæo-Christianity. In effect it reduced Eden to the most crueland sadistic of God’s jokes.- 93 -The “High Middle Ages” was not a particularly richtime in terms of the cultural arts, save for architecturalventures in the relatively severe and massiveRomanesque style, followed in the mid-12th century bythe Gothic (lighter and loftier construction, with greateremphasis upon vertical elements). Some notable balladsand poems ( Nibelungenlied, Parzival, Edda, etc.) werecomposed about this time, and music became somewhatmore complex in its written formats.Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was a Christian clericwho ultimately achieved Catholic sainthood by hissuccess in reacting to the challenge of Islam and therediscovery of Classical philosophy, particularly that ofAristotle, ca. 1140. By 1250 Aristotle's influence hadbecome so great that he was referred to as “thephilosopher”. Hence it was necessary to refineCatholicism to an intellectual precision comparable withthat of Aristotle, and also to make Aristotle's moresecular/scientific works tolerable to the church through aflattering interpretation of them.Invoking Aristotle's argument for an “unmovedmover”, Aquinas suggests that the necessity for a “firstcause” logically proves the existence of God. This waslater to be challenged by David Hume (who suggests thatcauses and effects can go forward or backwardindefinitely) and Immanuel Kant (who maintains that thedoctrine of causality is applicable only to the realm ofsense experience).Aquinas observes that Aristotle had advocated theprinciple that the “good” to be found on a large scale isbetter than the “good” to be found on a purely personalscale, since the larger good more closely approximatesand reflects the whole of creation.For non-human animals the “good” consists ofsensual pleasure, but for mankind something more issought. However, following the doctrine of his- 94 -predecessor, Augustine of Hippo (354-430), Aquinasrespected a distinction between the exaltation of God(Augustine’s “City of God”) and the lesser station ofmankind (“City of Man”). Aquinas saw man’s mission as,while tied to his own City, to ever yearn for that of God. Itwas not an achievable telos, or even a visualizable one,because of mankind’s post-Edenic sinfulness -redeemable only by the intercession (“Grace”) of Christ.So mankind’s redemption lies beyond this life: thevision of God. The aim of incarnate life is thus “notmerely to live in virtue, but rather through virtuous life toattain to the enjoyment of God”. Since natural humanvirtue is insufficient to attain this, it is not the task ofsecular rulers but rather that of Christ through hischurch, to whose pope “all kings in Christendom shouldbe subject”.In addition to the Aristotelian content of Aquinas’thought, there is the legalistic element: The OU isobedient to laws. Aquinas defined “law” as “an ordinanceof reason for the common good, made by him who hasthe care of the community, and promulgated”.But as nature is hierarchically organized into formsand organisms of greater and lesser complexity, so arethe universal laws.At the top is Eternal Law, which more or lessequates with the mind of God. Accordingly it isintelligible only to God.Next is Natural Law, which is Eternal Law to theextent that human reason can detect consistencies in it.Here would be found “scientific laws”.While Natural Law is comprehended through reason,Divine Law is identified by religious revelation -through Christ and the Christian church. Divine Law andNatural Law “rank” more or less side-by-side.Lowest on the scale is Human Law, a term whichencompasses laws which mankind makes in imitation of- 95 -and towards the “good” perceived in/revealed by Naturaland Divine Law. The “three drives” which tempt manaway from goodness are wealth, carnal pleasure, andhonor/status. Hence the “three virtues” are poverty,chastity, and obedience.It is the defining irony of Judæo-Christianity that itacknowledges “free will” only to condemn it as the“original [and ultimate] sin”. Mankind unaided cannotescape its curse; the species’ only course is to obey andimitate God’s laws, with the hope that this will win theGrace of Christ.This same demonization of individual consciousnessand its free will occurs in the other conventional religionsas well. In Buddhism, for instance, it is condemned asanatta, or “not-self”, which must be annihilated for thedevotee to attain obliteration and absorption into the OU( nirvana).7. Reformation:Crisis of Theological DeterminismBy 1500, as a consequence of the invention of theprinting press, Europe possessed an estimated 9 millionbooks, as opposed to fewer than 100 thousand hand-wrought manuscripts ca. 1450. The exchange of ideas wasaccelerated, and with it criticism of religious, political,and social norms.The Reformation, usually dated ca. 1517 to ca. 1648(end of the Thirty Years' War), was a 16th centuryreligious movement aimed at correcting real or assumedabuses in the Roman Catholic Church, and markedultimately by rejection of the supremacy of the pope,rejection or modification of much of Roman Catholicdoctrine, and establishment of the Protestant churches.The Reformation's key proponents were Martin Luther- 96 -(1483-1546) in Germany and John Calvin (1509-1564) inSwitzerland.While there were a number of sub-movementsthroughout Europe, they generally agreed uponFundamental Christianity as characterized by (1) thefinality and ultimate authority of the Bible, (2) denial ofthe authority of the church bureaucracy to interpret theBible, (3) repudiation of reason and affirmation of faithinstead, (4) condemnation of the use of force for religiousconversion, and (5) “the two realms” [spiritual grace andpolitical power] concept, which licenses unChristian actsif commanded by secular authority.To these essentially Lutheran points Calvin adds astrong element of church coercion of the individual andintolerance of alternative religions. “God makes plain thatthe false prophet is to be stoned without mercy. We are tocrush beneath our heel all affections of nature when Hishonor is involved.”Luther and Calvin believed that mankind is totallydepraved - that even “good works” fall short of God'sstandards of righteousness. The reason for ethicalbehavior is that a righteous man will automaticallyincline towards such behavior, not because it is logicallyor ethically justified in itself. Salvation is attainable onlyby complete surrender of the self to Christ.This constitutes a rejection of medieval scholasticism,and of the “logical ethics” arguments of Aristotle (“thisdamned, conceited, rascally heathen” - Luther) andAquinas. “Reason” is mistrusted and even condemned.Concerning the two kingdoms Calvin stated: “Let usobserve that in man government is twofold: the onespiritual, by which the conscience is trained to piety anddivine worship; the other civil, by which the individual isinstructed in those duties which as men and citizens weare bound to perform. To these two forms are commonlygiven the not-inappropriate names of spiritual and- 97 -temporal jurisdiction, intimating that the former specieshas reference to the life of the soul, while the latter relatesto matters of the present life, not only to food andclothing, but to the enacting of laws which require a manto live among his fellows purely, honorably, andmoderately. The former has its seat within the soul; thelatter only regulates external conduct. We call the one thespiritual, the other the temporal kingdom.”Calvin avoided prescribing the best form ofgovernment, feeling that this is a question for secularauthorities to decide. Luther considered collectivegovernments to magnify human corruption, hence hefavored monarchies.Against Catholicism Luther and Calvin argued theautonomy of the state under God. Against radicalfundamentalists such as the Anabaptists, they argued thetheological necessity for civil government. Againstaggressive civil rulers they argued the autonomy of thechurch [in the Protestant sense].Calvinism condemned art, Lutheranism tended toignore it, and within Catholicism there was a reactionagainst renditions of nudes, resulting in the defacing oralteration of many earlier works. Consequently therewere few Reformation-era artists of note, with theexception of Dürer, Holbein, and El Greco. Artists beganto work more as professionals, and to produce works forsecular officials and for the middle classes.In the scientific realm Copernicus (d. 1543) assertedheliocentrism.The greatest support for the Reformation came fromthe secular nobility and the emerging merchant middleclass. This support was born essentially of the desire bythese groups to rid themselves of the economic burden ofthe papacy and its subordinate echelons.In time the Reformation provoked the Catholic“Counter-Reformation”, a somewhat desperate and- 98 -militant retrenchment by that church. From 1545 to 1563the Council of Trent, a Catholic Church conference, metto resolve questions of dogma. Once decided, thesedogma were promulgated and enforced with aseriousness not found during the pleasure-loving papacyof the Renaissance. “If my own father were a heretic,”said Paul IV, “I would burn him.”In 1540 Ignatius Loyola founded the Society of Jesus(Jesuits), characterized by extreme discipline andMachiavellian social influence. Loyola placed great stresson education, and by the 17th century Jesuit-dominateduniversities were educating virtually all of CatholicEurope.After 1550 tensions between Catholics and Protestantshad reached the stage of religious warfare, culminating inthe terrible Thirty Years' War between Denmark, Sweden,and the Protestant German principalities on one handand the Catholic Hapsburgs (Spain, Austria, Netherlands,Italy, and most of Catholic Germany) on the other.France, though Catholic, fought against the Hapsburgsfor secular political reasons. Approximately one-third ofGermany's population died from the war and its side-effects, and the final Peace of Westphalia (1648) wasbrought about more by exhaustion than by genuinereconciliation.8. Secular Negative Free WillCulturally the 16th and 17th centuries were a time oftransition between medieval/Renaissance knowledge andthe new, scientific climate of the Enlightenment. Ancienthistory was still known only by the “Old Testament”,other histories being considered later and inferior to it.While scripture put creation at 4004 BCE, historiesbegan ca. 400 BCE, with large episodes of later historybeing unknown.- 99 -The universe was generally thought to be Earth-centric, and the non-Christian/European world wasconsidered to be “savage”. It was difficult for intellectualsto know just what to believe. Even the noted Galileopublished his Authority of Scripture in 1614, and IsaacNewton devoted many years to Biblical studies. He wrote:“If any question at any time arise concerning Christ’sinterpretations, we are to beware of philosophy and vaindeceit and oppositions of science falsely so-called, andhave recourse to the Old Testament.” A generation afterhe published his famous Principia, Newton was stilltrying to discover the exact plan of Solomon’s Temple,which he considered the best guide to the topography ofHeaven.Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) took a scientific,materialistic approach to the OU, asserting that thesupernatural or SU was beyond rational understanding.Impressed by mathematics and geometry, Hobbespostulated human behavior as similarly structured. Hethus sought to understand the “mechanics” or “laws” ofhuman social behavior. Hobbes departed from Aristotleand the medieval tradition by denying that man is a socialanimal, i.e. that he seeks companionship, society, andpolitical interaction as an end in itself. Man is indeed a“solitary beast”.Echoing the Sophists in Plato’s Republic: There is no“supreme good”; there is only self-interest andgratification. “In the first place, I put for a generalinclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desireof power after power, that ceaseth only in death.” The“supreme evil” is death, and it is fear of death thatprompts human cooperation. Society is thus negativelymotivated.In contrast to the “natural inequality” espoused byAristotle, Hobbes argues that all humans are “naturallyequal”. Hence the door is opened for social contract,- 100 -which Hobbes defines as a de facto contract between thepeople and the state for popular security and prosperity.The individual “contracts” with society and is thus boundto obey its laws, but he may disobey if his life isthreatened. He reserves the right to make this decisionfor himself.The social contract has two parts: agreement toacknowledge as sovereign the individual or groupselected by the majority, and the vote determining thesovereign.The task of reason is to intensify the fear of death andthe desire for comfort as factors in society - to the extentthat the resultant cooperation overcomes the destructivedesires for “glory” and “pride”.Hobbes’ ideal government has a simple task: tomaintain order and security for the benefit of the citizens.The citizens, he says, do not submerge their individualityin it; they are “contracting parties” with it. Governmentshould be authoritarian but not totalitarian.Hobbes preferred monarchy as a form of government,but monarchy based upon its social effectiveness inmaintaining order - not based upon the “divine right ofkings” principle.While Hobbes is systematic, he is not scientific in thesense that he supports his contentions with empiricalevidence. He is still a purely rational philosopher, muchlike Niccolò Machiavelli. He was the first exponent of“possessive individualism” - the trade-oriented ethic ofthe 17th century that ran counter to the landedaristocratic system and institutional religious conflict. Headvocated politics based upon material self-interest forindividuals.Hobbes differs from Machiavelli in that Hobbes doespropose a morally-binding social law (based on naturallaw in the “observed behavior” sense). Machiavelli is- 101 -comparatively lawless: no social contract, and of courseno telos: no rationale other than raw power politics.9. The Enlightenment:Secular Positive Free WillThe late-17th and 18th centuries loosely encompass ascientific and cultural climate known as theEnlightenment. The Enlightenment was not anorganized or coordinated movement [as could be said ofthe Reformation, compartmentalized though it was].Rather it was a sort of encouraging or stimulatingatmosphere for certain kinds of thought brought about byat least the limited acceptance of the ideas of a fewprominent pioneers such as Francis Bacon, ReneDescartes, Isaac Newton, and John Locke. Among thefeatures of the Enlightenment were:(1) A relegation of mankind to a “naturalplace”, not a privileged place within thenatural order of things.(2) A vague, general disbelief that God, if hewere presumed to exist, would ignore theoperation of natural laws to take an interestin the behavior of individual human beingsfor better or worse.(3) A sentimental admiration for the culture ofancient Greece and Rome, together with adistaste for the medieval Christian heritage.(4) Increased emphasis on the affairs of thepresent world as opposed to an afterlife.- 102 -(5) A growing humanitarianism, being respectfor and kindness to others for their ownsake as fellow natural creatures.The Enlightenment, however, was a phenomenonlimited to the literate, wealthy, and noble classes. Themasses of the European populace were still impulsive andsuperstitious. The 16th and 17th centuries alsoencompassed Europe’s great witchcraft hysteria, whenmillions of victims were tortured and burned to death atthe stake, primarily in France and Germany. Theappearance of Halley’s comet in 1682 was popularlyinterpreted as a sign of divine wrath.So the “confused” climate of Hobbes’ era continued topervade much of the Enlightenment as well. It may behypothesized that the forthcoming age of revolutions wasenergized by the spread of Enlightenment techniquesamong a general populace insufficiently educated [and“enlightened”] to handle them save throughoversimplified, extreme, violent methods.John Locke (1632-1704) was an advocate of a“reasonable” Christianity, admitting pro forma thepossibility of revelation but not taking it into politicalaccount. His religious toleration was noteworthy butlimited, excluding as it did atheists and Catholics. Lockesaw humanity as having begun in a “state of nature”:“Men living together according to reason, without acommon superior on Earth with authority to judgebetween them, is properly the state of nature.”The opposite of the state of nature is civil society:“Those who are united into one body and have a commonestablished law and judicature to appeal to, withauthority to decide controversies between them, andpunish offenders, are in civil society one with another;but those who have no such common appeal, I mean onEarth, are still in the state of nature.”- 103 -The basis for Locke’s civil society is cooperative self-preservation. Locke does not talk significantly in terms ofsuch ideals as charity, ethics, morality, virtue, love, etc.His basis for society is positive, assuming willingcooperation, as opposed to the point of view of Hobbes,whose society came together through hatred and fear.The state of nature shouldn’t be endured, since it ischaracterized by poverty and hardship. [Locke uses theIndians of the Americas as an example of people living inthe “natural state”.] The remedy is civil government.Locke introduced a “labor theory of value”, saying thatit is the changes wrought in the natural animal, vegetable,and mineral goods of the Earth which makes themvaluable. Another way to make them valuable is torestrict the supply by closing off producing areas, i.e.private ownership of land and assets. Locke defendsprivate ownership and accumulation of wealth and powerthrough money as raising the general standard of livingabove that of “penury”, which he attributes to the state ofnature. Hence the concept of property becomes central toLocke’s civil society. “The great and chief end … of men’suniting into commonwealths and putting themselvesunder government is the preservation of their property.”This “property” is defined to include “life, liberty, andestate” (the basis for the famous phrase in the U.S.Declaration of Independence).Since self-preservation (including personal property)is the most powerful emotion, Locke feels that anygovernment which is not based upon it is fighting natureand will not survive. He takes issue with the ancientphilosophers, who considered the emotions to be thingsto be suppressed and conquered in favor of rationalvirtues. Politically he was a social contract theorist,advocating a de facto contract between the people and thegovernment to provide for the people’s “life, liberty, andestate”: “Political power, then, I take to be a right of- 104 -making laws, with penalties of death, and, consequently,all less penalties for the regulating and preserving ofproperty, and of employing the force of the community inthe execution of such laws and in the defense of thecommonwealth from foreign injury, and all this only forthe public good.”Locke is responsible for the doctrine that allgovernment should be limited in its powers and existsonly by consent of the governed. He introduces theconcept of inalienable rights, which cannot be“contracted” away to the government or anyone else. Hepostulates that “all men are created equal”: “… therebeing nothing more evident than that creatures of thesame species and rank, promiscuously born to all thesame advantages of nature and the use of the samefaculties, should also be equal one amongst another,without subordination or subjection.”Locke’s preferred form of government is limitedgovernment, with the legislative branch superior to theexecutive. He considered the judicial function to beincluded in the legislative. He advocated policy-makingbased on what he called the “law of the greater force”,which is interpreted to mean majority rule. [This impliesthe “democratization of truth”, which Plato had utterlyrejected.]“Prerogative” is Locke’s term for the ability of theexecutive, king or otherwise, to occasionally act aboveand beyond the written law “for the public good”. “Thepeople shall be judge” whether the powers of governmentare being used to endanger the people. According toLocke, an abusive executive is actually “warring” on thepeople by using the force they entrusted to him againstthem. Thus he is no longer a political leader but a tyrant.He, not they, is outside the society.Locke distinguished between rebellion and revolution.He approved of the former and disapproved of the latter,- 105 -since revolution implies the overturning of the entiresocial order as opposed to ridding the society of a tyrant.Locke bases his political philosophy upon reason,paying lip service to rational ideals. Like Hobbes hewants to build a system that will reflect “basic man”rather than one which sets ideals and expectations forhim that he cannot reach. The advantage of this kind ofsystem is that it never over-reaches itself and rarely fallsvictim to hypocrisy of a structural sort, since not muchexcept cooperation and stability is expected of it. Thedisadvantage is that it is a difficult system to improve byinspired or intellectual leadership, since the politicalpower is concentrated in majority opinion - which tendsto be sluggish, conservative, complacent, and apathetic -unless a crisis shocks it into action. Political power can becorrupted through the economic, social, or demagogicmanipulation of the people.10. Secular Emotional Free WillJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) begins his SocialContract (1762): “Man was born free and everywhere heis in chains … How did this change come to pass? I do notknow. What can make it legitimate? I believe I canresolve this question.”Rousseau, like many other Enlightenmentphilosophers, postulated an impersonal God more-or-lessidentical to the “divine natural law”. He saw noconnection between the actual essence of God andconventional religious institutions; they distort andpervert. They are valuable only insofar as they contributeto society as reflections of the general will. As a popularordering device he would rather cynically propose theinstitution of a “civil religion” requiring belief in God,immortality, happiness of the just, punishment of thewicked, and sanctity of the social contract and the laws.- 106 -Subordinate to the civil religion, religious creeds wouldbe tolerated if they themselves are tolerant.Rousseau feels that the defects of civil society are dueto its basis in economic motivations. Since personal profitis the primary factor determining human relations, trustand fellowship are destroyed, and selfishness and neglectof civic duty are encouraged. The rich use society toprotect their privileges, and the poor are oppressed bythis same use of society.Rousseau denies that progress in the arts willultimately improve manners and morality [as themainstream of the Enlightenment supposes]. Rather thearts are increasingly corrupted because of theirrequirements for luxury and patronage in order toprosper. Moreover their subjects emerge from the vices ofthe soul: idle curiosity and desires for unnecessarycomforts.Rousseau’s ideal societies are the city-states of ancientGreece (Sparta in particular) and Rome, because theywere operated - at least originally - on the principles ofvirtue. His modern ideal state would be an improvementupon their basic concepts.Rousseau feels that the other social contract theoristswere not radical enough in their efforts to understandpre-political man. Hobbes was correct in saying thatsocieties are built on hostility and avarice, but wrong insaying that man is naturally this way. Locke was correctin saying that societies’ purpose is to protect privateproperty, but wrong in saying that this is natural andreflects justice.Rousseau’s “natural man” has two fundamentalpassions: self-preservation and sympathy with others ofhis kind. Natural man differs from other animals becauseof his capacity for free exercise of the will. He is notgoverned merely by instinct. The awareness of this freewill is evidence of the spirituality of the human soul [=- 107 -implies its somewhat vaguely-conceived reflection oflogos?]. Man can also use his will to improve his level ofknowledge and sustain it over generations. It is this samefree will which is man’s downfall, because he has used itto move from a “free animal” existence to the misery ofcivil life based upon inequality and private property.Modern man cannot very well go back to a naturalstate of existence, so … “[The problem is] to find a form ofassociation which defends and protects with all thecommon force the person and the goods of eachassociate; by which each, uniting himself to all, obeysnevertheless only himself and remains as free as before.”… to have one’s cake and eat it too: to reapproach naturalfreedom while retaining the benefits of civil society.Rousseau’s solution is that everyone first give all of hisrights and property to the state, and submerge hispersonal will in a cooperative “general will”. The onlytrue source of morality is this “general will”. Because it isa function of all the citizens, it is limited in its flexibility,and this limitation establishes the boundaries of morality.Having moved from a benevolent state of nature to a civilsociety which encourages hostility and avarice, mankindneeds a social contract which best reflects the “generalwill”. This “general will” will most closely approach thevirtues of natural mankind.If a man obeys his private will in a civil state, hereduces himself to the level of a brute animal and causessociety to degenerate into an oppressive, power-manipulative system. He must formulate his own will interms of relevance to moral principle [as expressed by the“general will”]. Thus society “forces him to be free” - toexercise his will in coherence with the “general will”. Hisconscious acceptance of this responsibility results in histrue human dignity.Rousseau is a republican by necessity, since modernstates are too large for direct democracy. He considers- 108 -representative government unfortunate, however, since itweakens the expression of the “general will”. Headvocates a majoritarian voting system, but he stressesthat this will work only if people do not vote according totheir private wills, but according to the rather severemorality imposed by the “general will”.Rousseau despised the democracy known to his timeas “a wild anarchy of self-interest”. Factions - such aspolitical parties and interest groups - would have to beoutlawed as devices corrupting a person’s interests andmotives away from those of the “general will”. Rousseauallows no reserved or inalienable rights against thegovernment [as does Locke], because they de factoweaken the “general will” by allowing individuals toignore the social contract at critical moments. Moreoverit is the private life of the individual which determines hisrespect for public laws and institutions.Rousseau is perhaps a little too convenientlyconsidered the philosopher of the French Revolution [asLocke is of the American]. It is true that Rousseau’sespousal of emotion over reason, and his glorification ofthe masses (the “general will”) lend themselves to thisinterpretation. But the actual causes of the FrenchRevolution (more properly Revolutions, as there was aseries of them) were the inability of the French absolutemonarchy to effectively run the country, and a nationalfinancial crisis caused by almost constant war and theexemption of the nobility and the clergy from domestictaxation.During the Revolution Rousseau’s appeal was never tothe middle classes of the “third estate”, who were uneasyabout the property-abolition aspects of his philosophy.Rather his appeal was to the more radical elements in thelower classes, who gained power for a time during theReign of Terror.- 109 -11. Free Will:Religious Curse to Secular ObliterationSo in this exhaustive and tragic historical survey ofhumanity’s grappling with a purely-Mechanistic conceptof “free will”, we have seen it proceed from religious curseto secular monster, both perceived to require subduingand surrender by the individual either to God or tosociety. The religious demand, culminating in themaniacal extremism of the Reformation, held out nohope or compensation for such surrender. The latersocial-contract theorists’ arguments ranged from themost ominous relief from nihilistic anarchy to somedegree of cooperative benefit and cultural emotionalstability.The premise of “free will” thus required itsobliteration, either voluntarily or coercively. Once againOrwell’s 1984 describes the inevitable result: atotalitarianism in which the individual has not onlyrelinquished his individuality, but indeed cannot evenconceive of it apart from the Rousseauean “general will”of the Party:“But how can you stop people rememberingthings?” cried Winston. “It is involuntary. It is outsideoneself. How can you control memory? You have notcontrolled mine!”O’Brien’s manner grew stem again.“On the contrary,” he said, “you have notcontrolled it. That is what has brought you here. Youare here because you have failed in humility, in self-discipline. You would not make the act of submissionwhich is the price of sanity. You preferred to be alunatic, a minority of one.“Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston.You believe that reality is something objective,external, existing in its own right. You also believe thatthe nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude- 110 -yourself into thinking that you see something, youassume that everyone else sees the same thing as you.“But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes,and in any case soon perishes; only in the mind of theParty, which is collective and immortal. Whatever theParty holds to be truth is truth.“It is impossible to see reality except by lookingthrough the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that youhave got to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the will. You must humbleyourself before you can become sane.” 39Earth in the 21st century CE remains predominantly amixture of both the religious and post-religious telos-ignorant. Like those chained in the darkness of Plato’sCave, they can see and think no further than the oldsuperstitions, fears, and social constriction of “free will”.Only through initiation can the few Elect of their numbercast off these chains and awaken to the true and non-destructive enlightenment of telos.E. Historical Non- Telos: DeterminismAs noted above, the alternative to Mechanistic freewill is determinism, which, as the term implies, deniesall conscious volition in the OU (which includes allhuman activity). This is the “cold, dead extreme” ofexistence, in which there is nothing but cause/effect,stimulus/response - all of which, were one to take allfactors into account, result in inevitable, predictableoutcomes.Determinism became fashionable in the scientificcommunity with the advent of Newtonian physics, which39 Orwell, George, 1984. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Company,1949, pages #205-206.- 111 -enthusiasts sought to extend beyond natural phenomenato all event interactions, including those of humanbeings. This resulted in the notion that human thoughtsand emotions could be not just predicted but controlledby identifying and manipulating the environmental,physiological, and psychological factors that govern them.On the scale of human communities and nations,determinism was loosely present in the East in suchconcepts as Taoism, in which the universe and everythingin it rolled inexorably onward through time, witheverything in it locked to that mechanism. There isaccordingly no personal discretion possible for Taoists:The most one can do is to sense and harmonize with theTao, so as not to be overwhelmed by it.In the West determinism got off to a slow start,b e c a u s e i t w a s a n t i t h e t i c a l t o e s t a b l i s hreligions’ (principally Judæo-Christianity) belief in acreative and active God. And, of course, in the relatedbelief that his human creatures had brought “original sin”upon themselves through Adam & Eve’s making a [freewill] choice. If there were no need for God, and if A&Ehad no responsibility for an “inevitable choice”, then theentire religious control system evaporates: There is nodeity to be vengeful; no humans deserving of vengeance.With the Enlightenment and the eclipse of literalreligious belief, however, came the notion that there wasa predictability, a mechanism in human affairs. This wasassociated with another supposition: that history was“progressing” through time from the primitive to thesophisticated. Interpretations of these perceptions wouldtake several forms, from the abstract to the neo-religious.1. EmpiricismDavid Hume (1711-1776) is the father of modernempiricism, which holds philosophical and political- 112 -values to be determined by habit and by their apparentutility, not by abstract virtues or ideals.Cosmologically Hume adhered to deism. The mereexistence of a political system or institution, according tothis approach, demonstrates that it has a part in God’soverall scheme of things. If it didn’t have such a part, itwouldn’t have come into existence. What that schememight be is not addressed by Hume, hence politicalphilosophy and systems cannot be measured criticallyaccording to it.L o o k i n g a t t h e h u m a n m i n d , H u m e s e e sperceptions, which consist of impressions “when wehear, see, feel, love, hate, desire, or will”; and ideas“when we reflect upon a passion or an object which is notpresent”.Impressions are more “strong” and “lively” than ideas.All ideas are derived from impressions. As a blind mancannot have an idea of a color nor a deaf man an idea ofmusic, so “we can never think of anything which we havenot seen [or otherwise sensed] without us or felt in ourown minds”. We cannot have factual knowledge ofanything which can be conceived otherwise. Since it ispossible to think that the Sun will not rise tomorrow, wecannot know that it necessarily will. The laws of naturewhich say that it will might change between now andthen.Mathematics and geometry are examples of things inwhich principles cannot be conceived otherwise. Onecannot think of a triangle whose internal angles do notadd to 180°.What Hume is getting at is that much of whatprevious philosophers had considered necessary cause-and-effect relationships is not that at all, but simplyhabit. “All reasonings [about causation] are nothing butthe effects of custom; and custom has no influence, but- 113 -by enlivening the imagination, and giving us a strongconception of any object.”When considering virtue and vice, Hume starts withthe notion that they must either be relations (resultingfrom the comparison of ideas) or factual matters(inferences). He finds that he cannot accept them aseither. Therefore they are simply irrational, non-factualpassions. Hume sees reason as a device used to satisfypassions, not something which is superior or prior tothem. “Reason is and ought only to be the slave of thepassions, and can never pretend to any other office thanto serve and obey them.”Hume considers the morally good as what one oughtto do according to prevailing passionate custom. Itcannot be ascertained by dispassionate reasoning.Reason may be used to discover the “fitting” - the mostpractical or sensible approach - but not the “morallygood”. Hence virtue and vice are products of sentiment.Virtue is not approved because it is virtue; it isconsidered to be virtue because it meets with passionateapproval.The good is identical with the pleasant, but notnecessarily with one’s own immediate personal pleasure.Examples of what Hume considers virtues: (1) Useful toothers: justice, generosity, beneficence, honesty. (2)Useful to self: prudence, frugality, temperance, industry.(3) Pleasant to others: modesty, wit, decency. (4)Pleasant to self: self-esteem, glory.We approve of such “virtues” because we are movedby a sense of humanity or benevolence. This is not a“natural instinct”, but rather the result of a sympathywhich humans feel for one another - a transference of theapplicability of others’ predicaments into one’s ownframe of reference. Social justice is sought not out ofsimple, direct self-interest, but rather because we feel- 114 -that even remote injustices will act to harm thecooperative society.Hume’s objection to social contract theory is that hethinks it is simply historically false. Rulers don’t considertheir authority as based upon the consent of the ruled,nor do subjects feel sovereign.Hume also objected to social contract theory on thegrounds that it was based upon reform of humans byreason. Hume argues for strong governments andpreservation of systems based upon their historicaldurability. He is thus a conservative.The Christian political thinkers had God/Christ-basedvalues. The social contract thinkers had reason-basedvalues. Hume has endeavored to deal with politics byignoring the former and denying the actual validity of thelatter. He thus finds himself in a no-man’s-land ofsubjective opinion. His somewhat clumsy solution is toendorse and preserve values simply because they havebeen around for a long time (i.e. conservatism). Strictconservatives tend to be Hume-like, just as radicals tendto oppose values based upon non-rational sentiment andto favor ideals based upon reason. This is not to say thatmuch of their “reasoning” isn’t guilty of the weaknesseswhich Hume identifies.2. Dialectic IdealismEurope in the early 19th century was influencedsignificantly by budding forces of Romanticism,nationalism, and liberalism.The first represented a rejection of the “cult of reason”espoused by the social contract theorists of theEnlightenment, in favor of a more emotional approach tosocial and cultural issues.The second represented a growing identification ofthe individual with a nation or state, as opposed to with a- 115 -city or monarch. This was particularly significant in thecases of Germany and Italy, which until now hadremained largely fragmented.The third represented a general impatience witharchaic aristocratic systems as justifying a state’sexistence. The Enlightenment and the Age of Revolutionhad opened the door to critical analysis of state systems,not just to their glorification.Georg W.F. Hegel (1770-1831) developed his theorieso f d i a l e c t i c i d e a l i s m a n d o r g a n i c i s m b yapproximately 1816, when he held a professorship at theUniversity of Heidelberg. His two principal concepts aredefined as follows:(1) Hegel conceives the universe as themanifestation of God’s mind seekingcomplete self-realization through a processcalled dialectic idealism. This isoccasionally [and more precisely] called thedialectic of absolute spirit. As appliedto Earth, it is the concept that the history ofthe world consists of part of the spirit ofGod, manifesting itself through thecollective spirits of mankind, movingonwards through logic (the dialectic)towards complete self-understanding. Anexisting idea (thesis) is criticized andpartially refuted by its opposite (antithesis),resulting in a more perfect concept(synthesis).(2) The organic state is the manifestation orappearance of God in the material world. [Itis not identical with God; it is a “reflection”of the dialectic of his mind. Accordingly itproceeds in ways and towards goals which- 116 -are not necessarily the sum total of the waysand goals of the individual human mindswithin it.In many ways Hegel is a reaction (antithesis &synthesis) to Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). BishopBerkeley’s subjective idealism had held that nothingcould be known objectively - that knowledge is limited tosubjective impressions. Kant refines this into what iscalled critical idealism, in which human consciousnessis subdivided into sensation, understanding, andpure reason. Sensations and understanding of themand consequences of them can be proven, Kant says, butpure reason (concepts unsupported by sensations) cannotbe conclusive. It is “beyond causality”.Hegel overcomes Kant’s problem by making “purereason” a necessary and intrinsic characteristic of God/the universe. All history is “logical”. If it sometimes seemsillogical, it is because we don’t see it as clearly andcomprehensively as God does. The task of philosophy,therefore, is one of understanding, of logical analysis -and not one of creation of abstract, ideal politicalsystems.Hege further introduced the concept of thephenomenology of mind as a variation on thePlatonic “pyramid of thought” concept. 40 With Hegel, ofcourse, the mind develops forward through time(historically); whereas with Plato the levels of thought aremeasures of excellence irrespective of time orprogression. Hegel’s phenomenology of mind begins withconsciousness, which is everyday experience (action40 In his Republic Plato stratified thought as eikasia (primitiveemotion), pistis (ordinary active/reactive thinking), dianoia (precise,logical, enlightened thought), and nœsis (intuition and apprehensionof the transcendent Forms (Egyptian neteru) and the perfect Good( Agathon).- 117 -and reaction to events) without self-consciousness. Wetake the truth of conscious experiences for granted; Hegelcalls this sense-certainty.As soon as one pauses to reflect on consciousexperiences, one moves to self-consciousness. At thesame time there comes an awareness of other selves,other minds. This is very close to Hobbes’ concept of thestate of nature. The antagonism is because “they exist andare not me”. Therefore I wish to control them and not tobe controlled by them. I wish recognition by them; I donot wish to recognize them in return. Thus there comesinto being the political “master/slave relationship”.The next step in the dialectic involves a personalinternalization of the master/slave relationship, asexemplified in Hellenistic stoicism and skepticism. Theinconsistency this produces between internal andexternal life goes on to produce the rages and hypocrisiesof medieval Christianity. In the Reformation the internalis seen as relevant to, and in command of the external.There is still the problem of conflict between individualwills, which, if undisciplined through organization andgovernment, would run wild in anarchy “… since anyinstitution whatever is antagonistic to the abstract self-consciousness of equality”.As consciousness gives way to self-consciousness,questions of morality ( Moralität) arise in contrast tocustom or social convention ( Sittlichkeit). How to aspireto morality?The answer is that one apprehends it through themodern state. Hegel’s concept of the state is that it is theembodiment of the spirit of those who constitute it; itsleaders must consider this spirit and not simply their owndesires when guiding it. Correspondingly individualsmust seek in this spirit ( Volksgeist) a guide for theirpersonal morality.- 118 -Human society is an artificial machine which worksfor the goals of the spiritual state. Individualism andrights against a government are considered by Hegel tolimit freedom: Since they reduce the scope and power ofthe whole, they serve to limit possibility.Similarly Hegel feels contempt for democracy. Itreduces questions of relevance to the state to resolutionby simple “counting of noses”, i.e. voting, in which allopinions are not of the same intellectual merit. [Hegelprefers a monarchy. This preference is a weak area of histhought, since it is not really justified. Why should anaccident of birth make one any better a judge of theVolksgeist?]For Hegel there are no absolute values. Values areproducts of history; they are validated by their success.Thus Hegel overcomes Hume’s objection to morality. The“social contract” theorists - Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau- felt that man made the state. Hegel reversed this, sayingthat the state is prior to man. He thus conceived the mostadvanced and complex metaphysical statement of man asa product and subject of his environment. Unlike B.F.Skinner and other environmental materialists, however,Hegel postulated a deliberate, universal intelligencebehind the historical process.3. Will to PowerFriedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) completed andpublished his major theoretical works Also SprachZarathustra and Beyond Good and Evil ca. 1885. He wasan atheist and a materialist, insisting that the universe[or world] of appearances is the only true one. He carriesthis principle into his assessment of humanity by denyingany “dual existence” within the body (i.e. soul vs. physicalbody). Man is a unified, material being.- 119 -Nietzsche defines the Will to Power as the inherentcompulsion of any being to create and control itsenvironment and interactions with other beings. Itsultimate expression in society is the creation of values bywhich other beings will live and be governed.Nietzsche attacks the Hegelian view of rationalhistory, asserting that it is full of “blindness, madness,and injustice”. By attacking “history as God”, of course,Nietzsche attacks any demonstrations of God which arejustified by a “rational, logical” historical dialectic.Past events, says Nietzsche, are valuable to the extentthat they serve as monumental models of past greatness,antiquarian mementos of tradition, and objects forcritical analysis leading to the destruction of erroneousvalues in favor of the construction of better ones. Abuseof the first leads to the mistaken idea that the past can orwill come again; abuse of the second leads to detachmentfrom the present; abuse of the third leads to a pessimismwherein one sees only the failures of things,unconsciously neglecting their positive legacy.Nietzsche interprets Hegel as saying that history hadnow reached its perfection in the contemporary Germanstate system. Nietzsche sees danger in this because itwould lead to lassitude on the part of modern man, whowould feel “there is nothing more to be done”. [Comparethe “last days” sects of early, medieval, and modernChristianity, as well as the “ecological doomsday”ideologies of the late 20th/early 21st centuries.]Man differs from other animals, says Nietzsche, inthat he has the power to “create horizons” - toconstruct visions, ideas, and ultimately philosophicalsystems. These horizons are meaningful to him unless heperceives them as artificial constructs. In that case heeither destroys them in favor of newer, larger horizons ordegrades himself by an artificial, hypocritical self-limitation to a horizon he knows is false.- 120 -Plato is wrong, says Nietzsche, in assuming there to beabsolute values (the Theory of the Forms). It is rather thecase that all truths are situational and relative. Hence thegreat virtues are supra-rational. They cannot beexplained by logic, as Nietzsche accuses Socrates of tryingto do. [Nietzsche is wrong; the Platonic Dialogues providefor nœtic apprehension of the Forms, not logicalconstruction or analysis of them. Moreover a Form is nota static concept.]Nietzsche’s attack on Hegel and Plato leaves his manin a very “naked” and self-dependent position. He has nogods, no values, no progressive history - nothing externalto help him. Thus disillusioned, he is strongly tempted toabandon all aspirations and live only for self-gratificationand comfort. This is Nietzsche’s “last man”. He seeksneither power nor social inequalities; he wants society“leveled” - everyone the same. “‘We have inventedhappiness,’ say the last men, and they blink.” [Nietzscheconsidered Marx to be the prophet of the “last man”ideology.] Nietzsche lashes out at the states of his timebecause he feels that they are tending towards the “lastman” condition. This is also his essential objection toChristianity and democracy: They destroy man’s creativepowers and opportunities to distinguish himself insociety.As the democratic world becomes more cynical ofgovernments and disillusioned by religion, it willgradually polarize into the haves (bourgeoisie) and have-nots (socialists). There is no justification for theacquisitions and possessions of the bourgeoisie; theyresult from petty self-gratification. What the bourgeoisieactually fear from socialist movements is that they willtake the acquisitions and possessions. Nietzsche hascomparable contempt for the socialists/radical leftbecause they insist on ignoring “the actual inequality of- 121 -man”. Hence the ideal socialist state is simply a tyrannyof the most inferior and the most stupid.Since all ideals, all horizons have been shown to befalse, the creative individual reacts against thisintolerable movement towards the “last man” with animpulse of nihilism. Nihilism as Nietzsche conceives itis a psychological sickness, a tendency towards self-destruction born of resentment of one’s perceivedimpotence in the face of a terrible, degenerate, yetseemingly inevitable future.This nihilism, continues Nietzsche, is false andunnecessary. It is caused by moral training [in particularChristianity] which suggests that we must be forgiven forexisting, that life is a burden, that self-love is sinful. Onemust wrench oneself free of this “Spirit of Gravity” andunleash one’s creative capability: the Will to Power. Hewho successfully accomplishes this is Nietzsche’s“superman”. The superman is not necessarily a politicalleader or despot, though he will be the architect of valuesby which society lives. He is a “horizon maker”, asupremely creative artist. He is not the product of anyparticular country or race, but rather of a purely mentalevolution.Nietzsche considers war to be an energizing,revitalizing influence in politics, deterring the otherwisesluggish descent towards the “last man”. “For the present,wars provide the greatest agitation of the imaginationafter all Christian raptures and horrors have grown stale.”But Nietzsche does not love war for its destructiveness.He says: “And perhaps a great day will come when apeople, distinguished through war and victories,voluntarily proclaims: ‘We break the sword.’ Disarmingoneself, from an intensity of feeling, while one is the bestarmed: That is the means to real peace.”Yet Nietzsche does not hold out much hope for arescue of humanity by his supermen. Around him he sees- 122 -only the march towards the “last man”, leading to a“succession of several martial centuries that have noequal in history … We have entered the classical age ofwar on the largest scale, the age of scientific war withpopular national support.” Looking ahead he sees “Signsof the next (20th) century: The entrance of Russia intoculture. A grandiose goal. The proximity of barbarism.Awakening of the arts, magnanimity of youth, andfantastic madness.”4. Dialectic MaterialismThe European industrial revolution, which created theconditions conducive to the onslaught of moderncapitalist/labor/socialist developments, began in Englandat the start of the 19th century. The move towardsindustrialization spread to Belgium as a consequence ofEnglish investments in that country, and France andGermany experienced their major industrial boomsbetween 1830 and 1870. Sweden, Denmark, and the lowcountries followed during the period 1871-1914, as didAustria, Bohemia, and Russia. By the period just prior toWorld War I, the principal countries which were stillessentially pre-industrial were Hungary, Italy, and Spain.During the 1870s a gradual transition could be seenfrom individual entrepreneurship to various forms ofindustrial combination and conglomeration. Governmentaid to such industrial enterprises was also a newdevelopment, consisting of a gradual liberalizing ofcorporate law and the instituting of protective tariffs inorder to help protect budding national industries againstcompetition from further-developed foreign ones. By the1890s England, Belgium, and Holland were the onlycountries still observing a free-trade policy.The consolidation and organization of businessencouraged (by example) the organization of labor. Labor- 123 -unions first began to experience general legal tolerationin France in the period 1864-1884, in England in1871-1875, and in Austria in the early 1870s. The firstinternational labor organization, the InternationalWorkingmen’s Association (the “First International”) wasfounded in London in 1864 and existed until 1876, whenit dissolved due to a split between the anarchist faction ofBakunin and the socialist/Marxist factions. In 1889 theSecond International came into existence, but it did notsurvive World War I.Marxism, sometimes called dialectic materialismto distinguish it from the dialectic idealism of Hegel, is atheory and practice of socialism including the labortheory of value, dialectic materialism, economicdetermination of human actions and institutions, theclass struggle as the fundamental force in history, and abelief that increasing concentration of industrial controlin the capitalist class and the consequent intensificationof class antagonisms and of misery among the workerswill lead to a revolutionary seizure of power by and thedictatorship of the proletariat and to the establishment ofa classless society.Karl Marx (1818-1883) was strongly influenced byHegel, but believed that Hegel had made a fundamentalmistake in using nations as the basis for his dialectic andin relating it to a divine manifestation or purpose. Marxconsidered the dialectic to be a function of economicstruggle between social classes, and he denied theexistence of any supernatural intelligence, calling allreligion “the opiate of the masses”.According to Marx, one cannot choose one’s socialclass. Rather one is placed into a particular class by theforces of economics, particularly the means ofproduction.As more and more economic power becomesconcentrated in the hands of the upper class (the- 124 -bourgeoisie), the middle class will disappear, leavingonly a large, impoverished working class (theproletariat) opposed to the bourgeoisie. Eventually thestrain between these two classes will lead to revolution,resulting in a classless, utopian society. [“From eachaccording to his ability, to each according to his needs.”]Marx called this end result socialism, but it wasultimately called communism. As a general rule,“socialism” means ownership of the means of productionby the state, while “communism” means ownershipcollectively by the proletariat.Essential to Marxism are the concepts labor theoryof value and theory of surplus value.The labor theory of value suggests that the value of anitem results from “the quantity of labor necessary for itsproduction in a given state of society, under certain socialaverage conditions of production, with a given socialaverage intensity, and average skill of the laboremployed”. Members of the proletariat “sell” their labor-power (the ability to labor for a specific period) toemployers from the capitalist bourgeoisie, but they arenot paid the entire value of their labor. The part that isnot paid to the laborer is called the surplus value. Thecapitalist keeps this surplus value as his profit.As smaller competitors are driven out of business, thecapitalist faces increasing pressure from largecompetitors. Since the cost of producing similar goods ismore or less the same, trying to undersell competitors isnot effective in the long run. The only way the capitalistcan increase his profit is to pay the workers less and less.As the worker realizes that he is being exploited, he willdevelop class consciousness and ultimately revolt.As economic forces and not ethical values determinerelationships in a capitalist society, Marx charges thatcapitalism dehumanizes mankind, causing insecurity,fear, and self-alienation. Unable to find value in other- 125 -humans, victims of self-alienation find it in producedgoods - a phenomenon which Marx calls fetishism (loveof possessions).Marxism began the transition into what is calledMarxism-Leninism at the turn of the 20th century.Vladimir Lenin’s “What Is To Be Done?” pamphlet waspublished in 1902. Lenin’s form of communism arguedfor a speeding-up of the Marxist process via a“dictatorship of the proletariat”, as well as forestablishment of a revolutionary socialist state prior tothe utopian state of pure communism.Marx’ utopian society would require perfection in itscitizens. This contrasts with most other politicalideologies, which are geared to deal with enduringimperfections in human relationships (hatred, greed,selfishness, sloth, power-lust, etc.).Marx, like Hegel, based his ideas on a necessary,inevitable force of history. Thus communism wouldeventually come no matter what capitalism tries to do tostop it. The other side of this coin is that there is nothingwould-be communists can do to speed it up; their societymust first evolve to the “last stages” of capitalism. Thefirst country to embrace communism, Russia, was not inan advanced state of capitalism - nor have been the othercountries which have become communist. Lenin modifiedMarx (“Marxism-Leninism”) with the concept of thestate-embodied dictatorship of the proletariat: therunning of the country by a communist party elite untilits economic systems could be advanced to fullcommunism. The state apparat would then “witheraway”. It is noteworthy that power is addictive, and no“temporary” communist governments have shown anysigns of withering away.Marx conceived communism as supranational,assuming the nation-state system to be a device foreconomic and class inequality and exploitation. In their- 126 -effort to justify their continued control, however, moderncommunist governments have strengthened theirnationalism.Marxism has been corrupted by its use as anideological slogan in many countries and systems whichwere completely foreign to Marx’ original analysis. Thisleads us to a certain contempt for “Marxists” today, sincethey seem to be emotionally, not rationally motivated.This should not necessarily reflect upon Marx himself. Aprecise Marxist would say that the economic polarizationforces which Marx identified have been delayed by deficitfinancing, compromises with the pre-revolutionaryp r o l e t a r i a t ( u n i o n s , b e n e f i t s , u n e m p l o y m e n tcompensation, etc.), but that these are all merelypostponements of a final reckoning.5. “Mind Control” and MindWarThe most recent, and sinister, concept of determinismresulted from medical and scientific discoveriesconcerning the physiological functioning of the humanbrain and its influence upon, if not complete control overthe individual’s sensory perceptions and emotions.Fictional illustrations, such as the book/film TheManchurian Candidate, portray human subjectsbecoming mindless robots through psychological andphysiological “brainwashing”.“Classic” determinism as surveyed above does notinvolve manipulation of humans’ physiology. Rather itproposes different scenarios of external, natural forceswhich influence human behavior. All humanity can do isidentify and attempt to live with such forces.“Mind control” thus not only introduces intentionalartificiality into the human equation, but indeed attemptsto do it so pervasively and powerfully as to overcome anyand all other behavioral influences.- 127 -As of this writing, fortunately, all such “mind control”experiments and programs have failed, the principalreason for this being the conductors’ complete andcontinuing failure to understand the actual constructionand functioning of human brain architecture. Mycompanion book MindWar explains this architecture,and why it [again fortunately] renders ManchurianCandidate ambitions quite impossible.MindWar also explains what psychological andphysiological influence of humans is possible andpractical, and proposes a constructive and ethical telosfor such an application.Indeed it is precisely the telos-basis of MindWarwhich illustrates and exemplifies why telos is theessential key to evolution and exaltation of humanconsciousness towards MS divinity and immortality.Absent such telos, the human race has nothing in itsfuture, as in its past, but Mechanistic suffering, futility,and eventual, inexorable extinction.- 128 -[index-129_1.png]- 129 -Chapter 7: “Death” DemystifiedTo die, to be really dead: that must be glorious!- Count DraculaA. From Terror to TransformationThe obvious fulcrum of the concepts and processesaddressed throughout MindStar is the phenomenon oftransition from physical to metaphysical humanexistence: what is commonly called “death”.Since “death” is not in fact death (in the sense of acessation of self-conscious existence), this chapter shinesa harsher, more explicit light upon it, to explode andvanquish the conventional, ignorant fear-conditioning sodeeply and constantly ingrained in human beingsthroughout their incarnate phase of self-aware existence.“Deathfear” is physical-body-instinctive, easily thestrongest and most unrelenting of all such emotions.Invalidating and rejecting it is one thing intellectually,but quite another viscerally. Even the most advanced andenlightened initiates can suddenly find themselvesstricken and terrified by it.So this is not a read/enjoy/relax chapter of MindStar:It is a rude-awakening, a shock that will accompany you- 130 -henceforth, very much a “Matrix red pill”. 41 Its discourseranges from the conventional to the extraordinary,pushing the limits of the reader’s coherence [and/orconfidence in that of the author].We’re going out on some limbs here, but you won’tneed a saw. As with other supra-rational concepts inMindStar, which thereby are not reconcilable by OU-exclusive laws of logic42, you will need to apply theanalytical tool of anamnesis, the dialectic precision ofwhich will enable you to recognize truth when yousee it - an exercise not of faith or trust, but Nœsis.Non-initiate humanity habitually regards “life” asbeing either a purely physical OU-function, or as a two-layered physical body with a non-physical “soul”. whichmay or may not survive the body’s cessation ofmetabolism and subsequent decomposition.The “blue-pill”-former is termed materialism, the“red-pill”-latter idealism. 43B. Who Owns Your Body:The protagonist of The Matrix assumed he did, untilhe awakened to discover it attached to a variety ofparasitical mechanisms. Let’s find out to what you mightbe hooked-up ...41 In the 1999 science-notsofiction movie The Matrix, a humansensing “something wrong” with his environment was told that it wasan artificially-conditioned illusion. He was offered a blue pill torestore it, or a red pill to shatter it. He chose the latter, andexperienced something rather like this chapter.42 The principles and applications of strict logic are reviewed inFindFar. Deductive and inductive logic operate exclusively withinthe OU.43 These terms for human life are used differently for the politicalprocesses discussed in Chapter #6.- 131 -1. State?Externally in society you know who you are bydocumentary credentials: birth-certificate, passport,licenses, diplomas, marriage/divorce certificates, andeventually death-certificate. All these are issued byvarious levels of the nation-state of which you are a“citizen”, in other words to which you belong. It is thestate that recognizes and validates you, and it legallyclaims both the responsibility to protect you and theprerogative to kill you.You and others may call yourself by many names, butit is the state which records and authenticates your“official”, permanent name.The state stipulates what officials, agencies,physicians, teachers, parents, and morticians can do to/with your body. It can punish you if you try to escape itscontrol, as well as deny your attempt to enter it. Frombirth to death you are enveloped in a “matrix” of its lawsand customs conditioning, controlling, and limiting yourfreedom of communication and action.Despite all-of-the-above, an individual wouldprobably argue that consciousness is untouched &unreachable by the state, and that this is the final,decisive establishment of bodily-ownership. 442. Religion?Life is a divine gift, conventional religions allmaintain, and in “intelligent” humans especially so,giving them dominion over the “lesser” flora, fauna, &features of God’s creation. Thus functions like mating,44 In 1984 George Orwell argued that in fact one’s “soul” could bedestroyed by unendurable torture (Room #101). But all that wasactually demonstrated was that self-preservation can be terrorized topreempt selfless love.- 132 -sex, and birthing are held to be sacred, and anyinterference with them sinful. The killing of non-humanlife is permissible precisely because it highlights the“special” status of human life.The killing of other humans is usually endorsed asself-serving collaboration with religion-hosting states, butonce again individual, non-state “murder” is not. 45 Mostsignificantly, killing oneself is condemned as the “greatestof all sins”. It is the ultimate insult to God to reject his giftof life to you, since it is a life, an “image”, that emulateshis own. Killing yourself is killing God “by proxy”, asillustrated by humans’ crucifying/killing God-as-Christ.As Judæo/Christianity lost its literal hold on educatedhumanity ca. the European Enlightenment, social-contract theorists contended more cynically that theChurch frightened adherents into continuing theirmiserable lives simply to extract tribute and toil fromthem. All disobedience, heresy, infidelity led inevitably toeternal damnation in Hell; only the most abject surrenderof oneself throughout life might possibly result in Christ’smercy - certainly not owed by personal effort.3. Profession?Some professions expect the individual to subordinatehis life to their success, mission, or image. The mostobvious of these is military service, whether state,mercenary, or revolutionary. You are expected to risk,45 In the United States, for instance, the military forces all includechaplains from all the profane religious institutions, ascommissioned officers with government-provided/funded facilities[in bald disregard of the Constitution’s establishment-of-religionprohibition]. The principal mission of chaplains is to convincesoldiers that human injury and murder ordered by the state is not asin in the eyes of God. Religions providing such chaplains includeJudaism, Catholic & Protestant Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, &Hinduism.- 133 -and if necessary sacrifice your life for the mission orcause. Decorations for valor are awarded as much forsuch personal risk and injury/death as for killing theenemy.In other professions, including religions, martyrdomis not only permitted but admired and rewarded. If aminister kills himself, he’s damned to Hell. But if he iskilled ex officio, he might well be canonized a saint.4. Psychiatry?The “medical” avocation of Psychiatry has as itscentral article of faith that any continuation of physicallife, no matter how painful or restrictive, is preferable todeath. If a sufferer contemplates suicide, this is “mentalillness” and must be enticed, argued, threatened,drugged, or padded-cell-imprisoned away. Your bodyceases to be your property the moment you want to getrid of it.5. Family?If you are a member of a family, other members of itwill claim all or part of your body according to your andtheir position. As a minor your body is controlled by yourparents, who are subject to state punishment if they don’tcontrol it as prescribed. If you marry as a husband, yourwife and relatives expect you to procreate as well asprovide. If you marry as a wife, your body is instantlysubordinate to reproduction and care of children.Suicide within a family is traditionally regarded as abetrayal of “family obligations”, a social shame to thefamily name, and even criminal culpability of othermembers who didn’t prevent it.Exclusive of self-serving exploitation, of course, theremay also be the factor of sincere romantic and/or familial- 134 -love. Of course persons genuinely and purely in lovecharacteristically don’t think of it in “property” terms.But if one is contemplating personal incarnation options,love for other incarnates is certainly going to be ofcritical, even determinant importance.6. Familiars?If your family extends to members who are furred,feathered, finned, or scaled, what you do with your bodymust take what happens to theirs into specialconsideration. Implicitly neither they nor you would seethis as a question of “ownership”, but certainly of a bondand obligation that goes beyond verbiage.7. Yourself!What the above recitation highlights is that, asintuitively as you assume your body to be “yoursexclusively”, this is true only insofar as you’re the onlyone inside it.Indeed even this is a bit of a broad-brush: Biologicalscience estimates that each human body contains about39 trillion living bacterial cells, so where the OU isconcerned, it’s more accurate to visualize a very largecrowd of critters who’ve somehow all decided to be “you”for awhile. 46At least in the metaphysical realm of the MS, thereare, as the Egyptians detected and identified, only eight ofYou. 4746 Nor do these remain the same 39T cells: The body’s Life-Field (LF)dictates the disintegration and regeneration of all proteins in thebody about every 160 days. Cf. C#5.B.2.47 Cf. Chapter #5.C.- 135 -C. Materialism - “The Big Black Sack”Since materialism holds that a human being isnothing more than a haphazard, temporary coagulationof physical matter/energy 48, “consciousness of self” isnothing more than an illusion which ceases the momentthe body stops functioning and decomposes. 49Hence whether this “illusion” is completely accidentalor constructed and emplaced by prior/super-natureintelligence/s is also a nontopic of permissible discussion.The only respectable assumptions are atheism andagnosticism.1. The Conceit of AtheismSome materialists are so fanatic in their certainty thatsince “they” are only freak, persistent electrochemicalaccidents, everything else in the entire OU must be too.Thus they confidently deny not just any creative geniusbehind the subatomic, interfunctional complexity of theOU/“Nature”, but the uniform and continuousenforcement of this “Natural Law” (NL) everywherefrom millisecond to millisecond.The odds against the entirety of this are prima facie"},{"pageContent":"impossible, so atheists handle this annoyance by refusingto discuss it. Questions as to why, if one’s personalconsciousness is nothing more than a freak electricalcollision in the brain, this “illusion” should continue withconsistent memory for the individual’s lifetime - and why48 Prior to Dr. Harold Saxon Burr’s 1972 discovery of LFs (C#5.B.2),conventional materialism had no way to explain the extraordinaryorganization, integration, & replacement of the human body’scellular & molecular structure. Materialists grappled with this crucialproblem by simply ignoring it.49 Cf. C#2.C.- 136 -such a “freak electrical accident” coincidentally occurs inevery other human brain.Insistent that “he” is nothing more than this electricalillusion, the atheist has nothing but nothing to anticipatewhen the electrical switch is turned off: the proverbial BigBlack Sack (BBS) of extinction, of nothingness.The absence of any supernatural morality, includingof posthumous reward/punishment for incarnatebehavior, makes sincere atheists that much moredangerous to others, as they are motivated only bysensual gratification. Some may of course derive pleasurefrom kindness, but others just as whimsically may enjoydepravity, torture, murder. Indeed the entire spectrum ofsensual gratification has nowhere a moral governor; theoverriding goal is relief from boredom, of being forced toconfront the futility of a meaningless consciousness.Emperor Ming the Merciless: Klytus, I’m bored!

Lovecraft, himself an exceptionally reflectiveatheist, was only too aware of this plight, highlighting itin his story The Hound (1922):Wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world,where even the joys of romance and adventure soon growstale, St. John and I had followed enthusiastically everyæsthetic and intellectual movement which promisedrespite from our devastating ennui.- 137 -The enigmas of the Symbolists and the ecstasies ofthe pre-Raphaelites all were ours in their time, but eachnew mood was drained too soon of its diverting noveltyand appeal.Only the sombre philosophy of the Decadents couldhold us, and this we found potent only by increasinggradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations.Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills,till finally there remained for us only the more directstimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures.It was this frightful emotional need which led useventually to that detestable course which even in mypresent fear I mention with shame and timidity - thathideous extremity of human outrage, the abhorred practiceof grave-robbing. 50Fortunately for Earth’s climatologists, as well as thetranquillity of cemeteries and mausoleums, today’satheists sublimate their ghoulish desperation for ultimateboredom-relief by the ongoing catharsis of multimediazombie-orgies, wherein the absence of a higher life-after-death is replaced by a decidedly lower one.

The Timidity of AgnosticismAgnostics seek to avoid the pretentious arrogance ofavowed atheists by maintaining that there is not enoughinformation to answer the design/enforce question oneway or the other.Just as glaringly this but begs the question, becausethe intricacy/consistency realities are every bit as visibleand inescapable to them. All they demonstrate by theirrefusal to confront the question is their fear that theobvious answer will doom them to “creationist” ridiculein supercilious atheist circles. Thus they succeed only inemulating ostriches. .3. The Prison of PhysicsThe annihilistic masochism of atheists and agnosticsis both understandable and unavoidable - for the simple,caustic reason that the science of OU physics is a priorirestricted to inquiries into the “how”, never the “why”. Itis a tabulation of effects, not causes.Indeed there are no instruments to seek or identifycause, and a claimant to causality would be ridiculed byand ostracized from the “reputable” (e.g. safe) academic/professional community for indelicate heresy.Such is the fate of iconoclasts from Galileo Galilei andRobert Fulton to Wilhelm Reich, Nikola Tesla, TownsendBrown, Oskar Klein, et al.What kind of instrument could detect or measure themetaphysical? After all, instruments are normallyconstructed with OU-sensors and read-outs.One candidate might be the sensory-deprivation tanksof Dr. John Lilly (C#8.B), precisely because their functionis to suppress the body’s OU-senses, but this blurs theline between verifiable reality and hallucination.- 139 -The discipline of “Radiesthesia” (or “Biogeometry”)attempts to bridge the physical and metaphysical, but atthis time has yet to establish verifiable, reliable results.Just as unfortunately, “fringe sciences” are notoriousfor being the stock-in-trade of unscrupulous stage-magicians seeking commercial reward beyond ethicalentertainment.Several obscure detection capabilities and thresholdsof the human conscious and subconscious mind aredetailed as “Psychological Controls” (PSYCONs) inMindWar. Without exception, of course, these are all OU-phenomena. Any representation or application of them as“metaphysical” would be erroneous or fraudulent.4. The Taboo of MetaphysicsOstensibly the antipathy of physics for metaphysicsdates to the European Enlightenment of the 17th-18thCenturies, not unsurprisingly reacting to institutionalChristianity’s previous condemnation of science andscientists as a threat to the Holy Bible.Admitting God as the creator of the OU would alsoimply his continued presence and willful discretion tochange or ignore its established consistency, e.g. by“miracles”. If he were ruled out altogether, “miracle”explanations for mysterious events would be moot.Ironically religionists have never attempted to arguethe active presence of God per the existence andenforcement of OU NL - which would seem to be themost obvious and powerful contention.Rather they have sought evidence of God’s existenceand power in claimed NL violations: “miracles” such asthe parting of the Red Sea, changing a person into a pillarof salt, and Jesus walking on water. The obviousabsurdity of such Vaudevillian dramatics served only toridicule religion all the more, whereas an argument based- 140 -on the evident omnipresence and omnipotence of NLwould have had quite the opposite effect.5. Inadequate AlphabeticsHuman language, especially in its most modern form,has played a crucial and often underappreciated part inthe marginalizing and mythification of metaphysics. Thefew terms that exist - such as “soul”, “spirit”, “essence”,“ethereality”, “psyche”, “supernature”, and of course“magic” - are so wooly, so encumbered with obsolescenceand triviality as to render them vague at best, silly atworst in serious discussion.The most sophisticated and educated metaphysicistsstruggle to express themselves [at least in English]because the words to do so adequately do not exist.6. SymbolismIn certain antiquities such as those of Egypt andRunic northern Europe, both written and inscribedcommunication went well beyond the merely alphabeticand phonetic to the acronymic; thus a single hieroglyphcan represent an entire concept, and a word of severalhieroglyphs a statement which in modern alphabeticswould require one or more sentences.Phonetic modern English utilizes 26 alphabeticcharacters. By contrast there are more than 2,000Egyptian hieroglyphs, which can be used and mixed fromthe phonetic to the acronymic.The study of hieroglyphics beyond the syllogisticlimits of modern alphabetics and languages, to their fulland frequently metaphysical meaning was one of themost important discoveries of René Schwaller de Lubiczas articulated in his Du symbole et de la symbolique(Collection Architecture et symboles sacrés). This[index-141_1.jpg][index-141_2.jpg]- 141 -methodology is known as Symbolique in French andSymbolism in English. Similar breakthrough-work hasbeen done for ancient north European Runes by Dr,Stephen Flowers in his Futhark and later analyticalbooks.An excellent illustration of Symbolism analysis maybe seen in Bram Stoker’s The Jewel of Seven Stars, whenthe Jewel in question, found grasped in her seven-fingered right hand when the XI Dynasty Queen Tera’stomb was discovered in the Valley of the Sorcerer.On a lining of white satin lay a wondrous ruby ofimmense size, almost as big as the top joint of Margaret’slittle finger.It was carven - it could not possibly have been itsnatural shape, but jewels do not show the working of thetool - into the shape of a scarab, with its wings folded, andits legs and feelers pressed back to its sides.Shining through its wondrous “pigeon’s blood” colourwere seven different stars, each of seven points, in suchposition that they reproduced exactly the figure of the- 142 -Plough. 51 There could be no possible mistake as to this inthe mind of anyone who had ever noted the constellation.On it were some hieroglyphic figures, cut with themost exquisite precision.Mr. Trelawny turned it over so that it rested on itsback.The reverse was no less wonderful than the upper,being carved to resemble the underside of the beetle. It toohad some hieroglyphic figures cut on it:“As you see,” said Mr. Trelawny, “there are twowords, one on the top, the other underneath.“The symbols on the top represent a single word, ofone syllable prolonged, with its determinatives. TheEgyptian language was phonetic, and the hieroglyphicsymbol represented the sound.“The first symbol here, the hoe, means ‘ mer’, and thetwo pointed ellipses the prolongation of the ‘r’: mer-r-r.“The sitting figure with the hand to its face is what wecall the ‘determinative’ of ‘thought’, and the roll of papyrusthat of ‘abstraction’.“Thus we get the word mer, ‘love’, in its abstract,general, and fullest sense.

Orwellian UnWordsGeorge Orwell realized the subtle, yet decisive powerof language in his classic novel 1984, in which politicalheresy is being systematically eliminated by thedestruction of words by which to conceive or express it:Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is tonarrow the range of thought?In the end we will make thoughtcrime literallyimpossible because there will be no words in which toexpress it. Every concept that can ever be needed will beexpressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidlydefined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out andforgotten.Already we’re not far from that point. But the processwill still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Everyyear fewer and fewer words, and the range ofconsciousness always a little smaller.Even now there’s no reason or excuse forthoughtcrime. It’s merely a question of self-discipline,reality control. But in the end there won’t be any need even53 Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, distinguished Keeper of EgyptianAntiquities at the British Museum, author of numerous classicEgyptological books, and fellow Initiate of Stoker in the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn.54 Stoker, Bram, The Jewel of Seven Stars. New York: KensingtonPublishing Corp (Zebra Books #416), 1978 (originally published byRider & Company, UK, 1912), pages #180-2, abridged.- 144 -for that. The Revolution will be complete when thelanguage is perfect.By the year 2050 at the very latest, not a singlehuman being will be alive who could understand such aconversation as we are having now.The whole climate of thought will be different; in factthere will be no thought as we understand it now.Orthodoxy means not thinking - not needing to think.Orthodoxy is unconsciousness. 55Orwell’s illustration was simplified into a dictionarywhich kept shrinking with every new edition.The reality, as detailed in my companion volumeMindWar 56, is more subtle but just as persistent:Humans form panoramas or “patterns” of reality overtime, based upon continuous and reinforcing sensoryinput, including political ideologies and propagandadesigned to instill and preserve desired values andinterpretations.While the more sensational and dramatic propagandatargets the conscious perceptions, the far strongerconditioning take place subconsciously: For examplethe term “democracy” means one thing to a capitalist andanother to a socialist or communist. Such patterns forman individual’s pillars of “reality”, identified and changedonly slowly and with considerable difficulty [if at all].As of the Mind-trilogy’s57 publication, the educationalprocess and environment in technologically-advancedcountries is undergoing further change consequent todigital media, which influence both subconscious andconscious thinking in audio-visual processes faster, moreintuitive, and less personal-deliberative than previously,55 Orwell, George, 1984. New York: Signet, 1949, pages #46-7.56 Aquino, Michael A., MindWar. San Francisco: Barony of Rachane,2016 (2nd Edition).57 The third book in the trilogy is FindFar (2017).- 145 -with “reality” becoming more of a variable than aconstant in the individual’s experience.8. Sacking the “Sack”MindStar now proposes to free both atheists &agnostics from the glum BBS prospect, and withoutrecourse to irrational faith:As discussed previously herein, the Egyptiansapprehended the OU as the physical manifestation ofconceiving principles: the neteru. 58 These wereSymbolized as animals or therianthropes; and rememberthat in this context Symbolism is an ideographicrepresentation of a concept beyond mere alphabetics, orfor that matter “simple picture”.Accordingly the neteru could just as easily be [andwere] called “Forms” by Pythagoras & Plato, “Æsir” byancient northern Europeans, or “Ainur” by J.R.R.Tolkien. What these aren’t are the “cartoon gods” asmoderns brought up on soap-opera mythologies areaccustomed to imagine and dismiss them.In these and other semblances, the neteru arepluralized for a more refined interpretation of OUcomplexity and interaction between markedly-differentphenomena. Lazier, simpler minds could [and did]describe the collective principles as a conglomerate, e.g.“God”.Does the OU require a prior imaginative, creativeagency to bring it into existence?Consider its size and complexity, which everywherefunctions precisely and harmoniously: a gigantic machine58 While references to “the Egyptians” throughout MindStar drawfrom a vast amount of primary & secondary sources, some of whichare cited in the Bibliography, especial cosmological sourcing is to the“Pyramid Texts” of the Old Kingdom dynasties. Cf. for introductionWm. R. Fix, Star Maps (London: Octopus Books, 1979).- 146 -of an almost infinite number and variety of workingparts.If the mechanism per se is not impressive enough,note that everywhere its components - both severally andin various levels of grouping - have a strong æstheticaspect: In short it is not just functional but beautiful inevery sensory, detectible medium. It is a work of art aswell as science. 59Absent the neteru, proposing that a machine like thiscould just appear and function by nothing more thansheer, random accident is not just slightly butoverwhelmingly beyond statistical possibility.The OU machine is characterized not only by itsintricacy but by the consistency of that intricacy:predictable regularity which, as humans have cataloguedit, is collectively called NL/“nature” [from neter]. So weconfront an OU which not only exists in its intricacy &æsthetic, but continues to do so strictly and inductivelyendlessly.Such consistency requires external enforcement; aclosed mechanism cannot “enforce itself” [any more thanit can originally “construct itself”].So the proof of the existence and power of theneteru is - and requires nothing more than - thefact of NL.Temporal incarnate humans are witnesses to NL, sothere is no question about its existence.The matter of how the OU originally came into beingis a bit dicier, and here we are talking about the origin ofthe entire NL mechanism, not just the metagalacticassortment of “space and stuff” we see at the moment.59 Arguably the apotheosis of arrogance rejecting an OU æsthetic wasJean-Paul Sartre’s Nausea (New York: New Directions, 1964), inwhich the protagonist Roquentin is “nauseated” by the mereexistence of material objects.- 147 -As discussed in the “Time” sections of FindFar, the4th Dimension is simply a measurement of changebetween the 3D locations of two or more objects orforces. Hence any variety of 4D “yardsticks” can bedevised and used within & among OU components, suchas human schedules in terms of the Earth’s orbit aroundthe Sun.However things become more problematical whentrying to measure the 4D of the entire OU, because thenat least one 3D externality is required, and none has beenfound to date. Indeed most astrophysicists cannot wraptheir heads about any kind of 3D OU externality - thatwould just not expand the parameters of the OU.In other words, it is impossible to “date” the entireOU.But what’s even more fun is that we don’t need to.The notion of “time” as a fixed, unidirectional linearprogression is nothing more than a myth of certainprimitive religions whose storylines require a “start”,“action”, and “end” [usually in terms of “sin”,“punishment”, and “atonement or worse punishment”].Absent such a threatening storyline, there is no actualneed for an OU “beginning” or “ending”: It simplyextends infinitely into both its past and its future [ormore accurately these would both be “measureless”].Correspondingly the OU neteru don’t requiredefinition in terms of “beginning or ending”.The implications of this brief preamble being that asthe essence (NL) of the OU is external to it, so theessence (MS or “soul”) of an incarnate OU-human is necessarily higher/external to it.This relationship is inescapable if each OU body’scoherence and continuation ( telos60) as an integral beingare to be maintained.60 Cf. Chapter #5.B.3.- 148 -Summarily: The actual, authentic You is not atemporary OU device; that is just its manifestation as atangible tool. You exist in the super-OU realm 61 of theneteru, which is literally “beyond time and space” [sincethose 4Ds are limited to within the OU].That You will continue past the discarding of yourtemporary OU body is thus not even a matter for debate.The only questions are what You can and elect to do withyourself after OU-disconnection.D. Profane ReligionsProfane62 human religions, generally identifiable as“mainstream” institutions targeting the widest expanse ofthe masses, are propaganda mills with the commonpurpose of the deception, intimidation, and exploitationof the ignorant and credulous throughout their incarnatelifetimes. Characteristics of the principal Western andEastern institutions may be studied in IlluminAnX. 631. Extrapolating IgnoranceProfane humans generally receive passive, faith-basedindoctrination only; they are not expected to activelyexamine or interrogate such indoctrination, indeed areusually reprimanded or punished if presuming to do so.Accordingly they assume themselves to be defined andmanifest by their physical bodies and senses. If they thinkabout “death” - which most avoid doing as much as61 Neter-Xertet. Cf. Chapter #7.G.62 From the Latin profanum: “before/outside the fane/sacredtemple”.63 Aquino, Michael A., IlluminAnX. San Francisco: Barony ofRachane, 2017.- 149 -possible - they imagine only the blind fear of the BBS.Thus they are easy prey for profane religions.Cruelly and cynically, the result is a danse macabre ofthe blind leading the blind, though a maze of mysticalnonsense, alternately promising posthumous reward forobedience and threatening eternal punishment otherwise.Not only do such religions have no actual power orauthority to decree such fates, but their private andpublic documents make it clear that they have not theslightest idea about actual “afterlife”, or even how todiscover it.Nor, all the more remarkably considering thesedestinations’ ostensible all-importance, do they evencare. The amount of profane-religious writings onpostcarnate existence is almost nonexistent, abandoningeven speculation to secular visionaries such as JohnMilton, Dante Alighieri, and William Blake.2. Procrustean PrescriptionIn ancient Greek mythology Procrustes was an insaneironsmith from Attica who prided himself on creating aniron bed that would fit everyone he kidnapped. If theywere too short, the bed functioned as a torture-rack tostretch them; if they were too tall, he’d cut off the excessfrom their legs and feet.Profane religion professes to know the “Why?”answers that OU science adamantly refuses to address.Why do individual humans exist as conscious entities? Islife the greatest of all divine gifts and blessings? Or is it asadistic joke: decades of affliction, fear, and toil, relievedonly by its ripping-away, unexpectedly and amidst pain,exhaustion, degradation? Followed by the even grimmerprospect of endless torture, with only an eye-of-the-needle chance for some vague bliss instead?- 150 -Are humans even given the option to embark uponthis journey? No.Can they abandon it if it’s unendurable? No, suicide isheld by all profane religions to be not just a sin, but theuttermost heinous of all sins (C#7.B.2.).If they struggle through their forced lives, obeyingevery religious edict as best they can, can they therebyexpect Heaven instead of Hell? Most certainly not:Humans can never escape their own “original sin” if theyare Jews; all are destined for the same posthumousnightmare.And if Christians they can still not save themselves nomatter how devout they are; only the whim of JesusChrist can purify them. And if the New Testament is anyguide, he is just as likely to bless a whore as a virgin.Perhaps more so.So welcome to the bedroom of Procrustes. You areplaced on Earth with a “Guilty!” sentence hanging like animmaculate albatross around your neck. You now faceperhaps eighty years of every possible physical ordealbefore you, which brief interludes of happiness onlyhighlight as all the more recurring and relentless. Youhave nothing to look forward to but a painful, terrifyingdeath-throe at an unknown moment.And this was the pleasant part: Now if you areJewish, you are condemned to an eternity of desolation inSheol, And if a Christian or Muslim, a far greaterlikelihood of eternal, hideous torment and torture in Hellthan admission to Heaven on the mere whim of Jesus orMohammed.Expect to escape this doom as a Hindu or Buddhist?Sure, you get to stay right here! If you’ve been anormally-flawed human, though, expect to come back asa centipede or wharf-rat.Isn’t it a relief to know that “all of the above” isnothing more than cruel, cold-blooded enslavement lies?- 151 -3. Sometimes They Come Backa. Reincarnation“Reincarnation” - the centipede/rat scenariomentioned above, began as a Buddhist and Hindu idea,because these do not posit the Judæo/Chistian Sheol/Heaven/Hell repository, so needed to think of somethingelse to do with expiring souls. It seemed simplest just torecycle them, with the profane-control threat being theprovision for slippage down the organismarchy if youwere uncooperative this carnation.As examined in more detail in IlluminAnX, thisHindu/Buddhist invention was later borrowed by someprofane Western “initiatory” groups as something more“occult” than the old, depressingly-inevitable S/H/H.And exciting because, unlike conventional J/C, such an“initiate” could self-redeem beforehand - guaranteeingeither a ticket to Heaven or at least a promotion for thenext reincarnation! How could this be accomplished?In the 13th Century CE Jews [and uncertainChristians] were offered a new hope for non-Messianicredemption from both Adam & Eve’s Original & their ownadditional sins. The Spanish Jew Moses de Leónauthored a series of books, the Zohar (“Splendor”),claiming to reveal divine mysteries concealed in theTorah. 64The mysticism contained in the Zohar is known as[Hebrew] Cabala (aka “Kabbalah”, “Qabala”, etc.). Theword means “aligned” or “corresponding”, and purported64 Moses de León ascribing the Zohar to the 2nd-century rabbiShimon bar Yochai, who hid in a cave for thirteen years studying theTorah and was inspired by the prophet Elijah to write the Zohar.León’s widow confessed that her husband had written it, using theprophet for profit. ( Jewish Encyclopedia, Funk & Wagnalls)- 152 -to chart an initiatory pathway to redemption by personaleffort alone.Standard Buddhist/Hindu reincarnation is primafacie nonsense. With the occasional exception of a few re-Napoleons and -Cleopatras in sanitariums, newbornshave not appeared with oldmemories. And of courseneither Gautama nor Vishnu set up an equivalency ofold/new bodies.Nor in the B/H model, would it make sense toeradicate one’s previous personality, memory, andaccumulated knowledge with a physical reincarnation.This would make the entire operation pointless, since thereincarnate would be completely new and unique fromany perspective. Punishment or promotion would beequally pointless.Some “pop-occult”-fantasies notwithstanding,Egyptian metaphysics included absolutely no concept ofphysical reincarnation. The B/H model of “identityrestart” would amount to sacrilegious murder of the ren-emanation of the MS: an inconceivable blasphemy.As detailed herein, the entire curriculum of Egyptianinitiation involved extension and exercise of the body andits senses to enable identification and realization of theeight MS emanations, following which the body isdiscarded and the MS embarked upon its neter-immortality.So while bodified you’re not expected to cringe beforereligious threats of punishment, or equally-emptypromises of reward. As the Egyptians represented by thesymbolism of Maat, and their disciple Plato by hisconcept of the Agathon65, your desire to be and do theGood is yet another anamnesis: an innate nobility of yourMS which you have only to acknowledge and actualize.65 The highest Good for its own sake. Cf. MindWar & FindFar.- 153 -b. ResurrectionChapter #4.D examines the rather repulsive and grislysuperstitions of J/C relating to dead bodies in whichhuman “souls” were either permanently imprisoned orreinserted by God/Jesus.Summarily Hebrews had no concept of the “soul”beyond a mere animal-animating force ( nephesh), ofwhich only reviled and feared elementals elohim andrephaim remained with the corpse.The early Christians [erroneously] mistook the Greekpsyche for the Hebrew nephesh, insisting that, althoughsundered at death, it would soon reunite with its deadbody:And fear not them which kill the body, but are notable to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able todestroy both soul and body in hell. 66The immediate, if short-lived (!) resurrection of Jesuspost-crucifixion was held to exemplify this:And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in themidst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposedthat they had seen a spirit.And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? andwhy do thoughts arise in your hearts?Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself:handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones,as ye see me have.And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them hishands and his feet.And while they yet believed not for joy, andwondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of anhoneycomb.66 Moses et al., Holy Bible. Garden of Eden: Day 1+, Matthew 10:28.- 154 -And he took it, and did eat before them. 67However dramatic this Easter-fable, it has nosignificance beyond that - not just for the obvious reasonthat Jesus did not permanently revive, but more thatsome theoretical future Night of the Living Dead wouldseriously overcrowd Earth with re-animatees utterlyadrift from their original envirotimes. It is difficult toimagine how any such Christian finale could be anythingbut a worldwide disaster.(1) NecromancyRitual summoning of the Departed has been aninterest of ceremonial magicians, mediums, scientists,and séancetists since antiquity. Most of this can bewritten off to the superstitious, delusional, or fraudulent.But if thought is indeed a field-phenomenon and theMS is immortal, there is no reason to assume thatcommunication of the ESP-type is impossible. While afull inquiry into this would require its own book, here itmay be noted that the seemingly-fanciful trappings ofritual chambers, séance parlors, and Expressionisticmad-laboratories should not be dismissed too quickly orcontemptuously. As discussed in MindWar, deliberateconcentration and energizing of both conscious andsubconscious thought requires reinforcement by andnon-distraction of the body’s physical senses. This can beeither by minimizing them [as in Yoga-meditation or Dr.John Lilly’s sensory-deprivation tanks], or in theselection/construction/decoration of enhancingexternalities.Beyond its range of physical senses, the human bodycan both detect and react to a wide range of waves and67 Ibid., Luke 24:36-43.- 155 -fields within and possibly beyond the ElectromagneticSpectrum. Many of these EMS functions are detailed asPsychological Controls (PSYCONs) in MindWar. Dr.Lilly’s tanks did not specifically identify or reduce/these.What would have been needed was for the tank to besurrounded by a “Faraday Cage”, indeed one enhanced tonullify all externalities. 68(2) ZombificationThe reanimation of dead human bodies minus the“soul” (personality, intelligence, conscience) of the once-person has assuredly been grist and gore for horror fromHaiti to Hollywood.In his The Serpent and the Rainbow (Warner, 1987),Wade E. Davis (Ph.D. Ethnobotany) exposes the Haitianpractice as the controlled use of poisons.As for modern “Zombie Apocalypse” reverie, there ismore than a passing allusion to the worrisome opiateepidemic, combined with the alarming dumbing-down ofan undereducated populace. Still this hasn’t yet advancedto mass-mob cannibalistic extremes. 6968 While it is obvious to even the minimally-intelligent that the GreatPyramid of Giza was never anyone’s tomb, its true purpose hasremained elusive, not the least because of the odd interiorarchitecture, dimensions, baffles, sinks, and angularities. Publishedinstrument readings, spatial relationships, and the constitution ofthe “King’s Chamber” coffer just happen to add up to a very tidysensory-deprivation Faraday Cage - which would explain Napoleon’scomments. Cf. Wm. R. Fix, Pyramid Odyssey (New York: MayflowerBooks, 1978).69 Perhaps I spoke too fast: A 2018 Google-search for “zombie food”yields no fewer than 140 million websites of munchies, crunchies,recipes, and party-catering! “Zombie rock music” brings up 63million more, in case the decomposing feel like dancing ...- 156 -E. Posthumous Pageantry“Deaths” of their slaves, and particularly the moreprominent ones, are beloved by profane religions for thespectacles they invite, both immediately and sometimesannually thereafter. Or even daily, as in the case of thefamous “Woman in Black” visiting Rudolph Valentino’scrypt.As with the event of “death” itself, the commonfeature of all such profane necrofestivals is completedisinterest in the current state of the deceased. There isnever any concern or conversation about whether theindividual is in Heaven or Hell: how to congratulate theformer or commiserate the latter.With the possible exception of Elvis Presley, no time isspent searching for reincarnations either. 70 But even afterseveral samplings of “Thriller”, the author remainsuncertain whether Michael Jackson was indeed then/subsequently zombified. And some personages, such asJames Dean, Princess Diana, Jim Morrison, and AdolfHitler, mesmerize the masses far more as avatars thanactualities. On the other hand, perhaps Morrison alreadywas one?F. Monolithic AnamnesisTo understand physical “death” accurately, it is firstnecessary to dispel the notion that physical “death” is anutter and final end: the proverbial “Big Black Sack”propaganda of the profane. In actuality it is nothing ofthe sort, but a consciousness-evolutionary process which70 Except upon the disincarnation of the Dalai Lama, whichprecipitates a search for his new embodiment. Unlike The King,however, His Holiness usually reappears in Tibet instead of LasVegas.- 157 -is easily realizable and identifiable once one knows whereand how to look for it.As so much else in MindStar, this is a practical,personal exercise in anamnesis: recollective Nœticknowledge of primal truth (a neter or Platonic Form).Once alerted to anamnesis, and upon exercising therequisite dialectic thought-discipline to attain it, its utilityand veracity will be definitively and reliably self-evident.While anamnesis may be activated by simpleprompting [as illustrated by Plato’s Dialogue the Meno],it can also be utilized in extensive and elaborateexplorations [as illustrated in the “Sphinx & Chimæra”Afterwords to this book].For a convenient metaphor to illustrate the “death”-transitional sequence, we need look no further than theclassic science-fiction movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.[Do not read this as nostalgic entertainment. It is anexercise to replace the prevalent, preconditioned mentalmodel of “death as BBS obliteration” with a schematic ofcontinuation and evolutionary transition.]As you apply anamnesis to this, its actuality willreplace the BBS falsity, freeing you from enslavement tothat hopelessness and despair. 71In this collaboration director Stanley Kubrick andauthor Arthur C. Clarke were not too far off when, at theculmination of the film, the transitioned MS of astronaut71 In Greater Black Magic (GBM) a purgative ritual such as this iscalled a Black Mass. And authentic BM has nothing to do withmockery of the Catholic Mass [except for addicted Catholics]; it is aritualized shock tailored to each celebrant, the purpose of which isthe removal and dissipation of identified self-destructiveness. Iteliminates taboos, sacred cows, and all similar conditioning, whetherconscious or subconscious.A famous “secular” example is the shattering of Winston Smith’sJulia-addiction in George Orwell’s 1984 by a stronger BM of rats inRoom #101.In his The Aristos and The Magus, John Fowles described theBM as “disintoxication”.- 158 -David Bowman was represented as an “embryonic star-child”. As he awakened, wrote Clarke, “he wasn’t surewhat he was going to do next ... but he would think ofsomething.”2001 starred a flat-black, Golden-Rectangular 72Monolith with the “missing link” power to catalyzesuccessive stages of human consciousness evolution:from instinctive-animal to Homo Sapiens in prehistory,then from intelligent incarnation to pure mentality (=“star-child”), activated once man had advancedsufficiently to reach the Moon and encounter a “sentinel”Monolith. 73The prehistoric and Moon Monoliths are followed by athird, floating in space near the Jovian moon Europa.Bowman’s transitional trip through it occurs in twostages:First his 3D-defined body is subjected to a series ofextreme physical forces to destroy its OU-physicaldisplacement.The metamorphic Bowman then finds himself in aSubjective-Universal (SU) “hotel suite” in which he issuspended while his OU 4D accelerates to match the dis-integrated 3D, as illustrated by a hypercompressed agingprocess.The “OU-4D-vacated” Bowman now re-enters theMonolith to complete his transition to a third, whollymental stage of evolution, theatrically portrayed as the“star-child”. In Egyptian Symbolism, Bowman’s MS has72 A golden rectangle is a rectangle that can be cut up into a squareand a rectangle similar to the original one. All golden rectangles aresimilar and the ratio length/width = golden ratio = (1+ sqrt 5)/2, orϕ. ϕ is held to be the universal standard of beauty in proportion.73 Clarke’s original 1948 short-story was entitled The Sentinel,describing just such a Moon-trigger, without speculating on theconsequences of its activation. Sentinel was later expanded into2001.- 159 -cast aside its khat-OU4D incarnation to reconstitute itselfon a ka-basis. 74Not being initiates or Symbolists, neither Kubrick norClarke found the imagery or language to be this specific.What audiences see is therefore their “Nœtic sensation”of this process: an artistic act of anamnesis. 75 It is the same anamnesis in2001 which impresses them with asubconscious sense of the intrinsic correctness, thevalidity of this film-sequence without being able to put itinto words.Stanley Kubrick was an avowed atheist, who, havingillustrated next-stage evolution, felt no need to define it.Famous for completely differentiating his films, he simplywent on to A Clockwork Orange, then Full Metal Jacket.But Arthur Clarke was less sanguine about the doorhe’d cracked open. Popularly regarded as one of the “BigThree” moderns of science-fiction, he had to stand upagainst the other two: atheists Isaac Asimov and RobertHeinlein. The unspoken ethic was that any hint ofsupernaturalism in their stories would taint their“science”, take them down a stage to “fantasy”. 76 Themost that Clarke permitted himself in interviews was a74 An Egyptian illustration of this transitional process was authoredby Bram Stoker in The Jewel of Seven Stars (1903), based upon theGBM Opening of the Mouth. It was filmed, more sensationally thanaccurately, as Hammer’s Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb (1971) andThe Awakening (1980). An extract from the Stoker novel is includedunder the discussion of the ka-emanation in MindStar.75 Cf. Chapter #4.A.76 When in 1982 Isaac Asimov sequeled his famous Foundationtrilogy with Foundation’s Edge, I pointed out to him that his hero’schoice of Gaia in favor of the First and Second Foundations smackedsuspiciously of Paris’ choice of Aphrodite over Hera and Athena inGreek mythology, Isaac amusedly admitted that I’d caught him; henursed an affection for that legend.- 160 -Deistic shrug that God might have created the OU, but ifso paid no further attention to it.Obviously Clarke was left floundering what to do withhis 2001 “star-child”. In 1982 he finally came up with thesequel 2010: Odyssey Two, in which an inexplicably-re-OU4D David Bowman chats with his wife on television,materializes on Earth to visit his mother, and thenbequeaths the entire Solar System to humanity as long asit stays away from Europa [for which no reason isgiven77]. To emphasize this Dave changes Jupiter into asecond sun for the System, doubtless precipitating bothgravitational and radiation catastrophes for all theremaining planets. Perhaps unsurprisingly Arthur didn’tstick around to watch this happen; he went through hisown Monolith two years earlier in 2008.With the perspective of initiation, we can do a bitbetter than Kubrick & Clarke as to “what’s beyond thethird Monolith”:G. Neter-XertetHaving rejected the Big Black Sack of atheism/agnosticism, as well as its tacit but camouflagedacceptance by profane religion, the obvious questionremains: If upon disassociation from a physical humanbody, where does the MS “go”?“Go” is in quotes because the MS isn’t a 4D OUdisplacement that is either stationary or mobile againstOU points of reference. It is of metaphysical, notphysical constitution and integrity, like the neteru, andcan be accurately conceived and understood only uponthis realization and in this context.77 It turns out that there’s yet another one of those you-know-whatsdown there in a swamp, but so what?- 161 -Human brains conditioned to working with theirphysical senses alone are accustomed to regard the OU(the perceptive extent of those senses) as the whole ofreality.These same physical senses are almost, but notcompletely useless where reality beyond the OU isconcerned. The key to that capacity lies in the mind’scapacity for intuition. This has nothing to do with thecommonplace use of this term for guesswork andhunches. Rather it constitutes the capacity of thoughexclusive of all OU-sensory receptions and theiraccumulated reality-patterns. This is the intuitiondescribed by Plato as Nœsis.As illustrated by the structure of the PlatonicDialogues, Nœsis is attainable only after an individualhas recognized and freed himself from a “pyramid” oflesser, OU-referential thinking: a “thought purification”process called by Plato the Dialectic. 78 In the Dialoguesit is illustrated by conversation in order to render itintelligible in words; but the process itself is purelymental. Experienced Initiates can activate Nœsis byreflective thinking alone: “turning the mind in uponitself”. The term meditation most closely characterizesthis, although again that term has been popularlycorrupted in various recreational expressions.Accordingly there is no “physical [in the precise senseof that term] place” wherein the neteru - and eachindividual MS - dwell. For conversational convenienceonly the Egyptians identified it only as the Neter-Xertet(Place of the Neteru). In conventional Egyptology it isfrequently confused with the Tuat (Underworld) orAmenti (Afterworld), simply because of the acceptedportrayal of Egypt “soul”-mythology as a Hebraic-style78 Cf. FindFar for detailed discussion & illustration of the PlatonicPyramid of Thought.- 162 -“Heaven/Hell” journey & repository. As Symbolismreveals, the multi-aspect MS is not reimprisoned in apostmortem body and dragged before a “Hebrew-Godly”Osiris to be judged and consigned to a Heavenly Amentior Hellish Tuat.The neteru are utterly unconcerned with pre-mortem human morality. “Weighing of one’s heartagainst a feather” represents each MS’ transition fromOU-referential morality (symbolized by the ab or “heartemanation”) to pure/abstract neter-morality assymbolized by Maat.Expect your eventual awakening [or “entry” if that iseasier to conceptualize] to Neter-Xertet to be a wondrousunfolding of possibilities, limited only by your owncoherence, creativity, and courage.This “destination” is the same for every consciousentity’s MS; the only difference is with what Nœsis youanticipate and plan for it. If you’ve “died” expectingnothing but the terror and obliteration of non-initiation’sBBS, it’s going to take you awhile to get over yoursurprise, relief, and wonder: a meta-“rebirth” notaltogether unlike your previous, more constrainedincarnate one.H. The Two PathsThe initiatory journey to Neter-Xertet is by one of twoPaths: the Right-Hand (RHP) and Left-Hand- 163 -(LHP). 79 The Egyptians represented these respectively inSymbolism as HarWer80 and Set.811. The Right-Hand PathA MS which has chosen the RHP emerges in willfulsynchronicity with the natural neteru, enjoying the richharmony of their collective Natural Law. In thisenvironment the MS is no longer be-Set by the tensionsof incarnate tension between a self-affirmativeconsciousness enveloped in NL regularity. By far themost initiated MSs arrive via the RHP and enjoy thisexperience of Neter-Xertet as “participant” rather than“creator” neteru. 82Such NL-harmony is also the transitional emergenceof non-initiate MSs, the difference being that, a bit like2001’s “star-child”, they don’t anticipate it and will need79 While these terms originated in Buddhism to designate asexual/sexual rituals, and were later used in Judæo-Christianity todistinguish angelic from dæmonic occultism, they are used herein asin the Temple of Set: RHP = OU inclusion & harmony; LHP = OUdistinction & independent creation. Cf. The Temple of Set andIlluminAnX.80 “Horus the Elder”: the original, pre-Osirian Horus as the neter ofthe Solar daylight, complement of Set as neter of the night sky andthe seven circumpolar stars ( Septemtrione). Together Set andHarWer functioned in complementary contrast as the Sam-Taui,represented in Symbolism as a human figure with both their heads,or the two of them ceremonially binding-together the Djed-pillar ofExistence. [In later Osirian mythology Horus was re-cast as Osiris’son (hen “the Younger”) and Set as Osiris’ evil brother. MindStarrefers to their original apprehension.]81 Cf. Sir J. Norman Lockyer’s The Dawn of Astronomy: A Study ofthe Temple-Worship & Mythology of the Ancient Egyptians.Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1964.82 In human mythology this is somewhat similar to the differencebetween “angels and archangels”, Tolkien’s “Maiar and Valar”, etc.- 164 -to gradually discard their BBS terror and/or profanereligions’ “afterlife” myths. But relief and harmoniousconsciousness will gently and comfortably arise, withoutsacrifice of individuality.While neither violating nor wishing to violate NL,RHP MSs may freely observe and move about in the OU,indeed to the extent of subtle interaction [as the khabit]with still-incarnate beings. Such interaction is sensed bythe incarnate at both conscious and subconscious levelsof thought: the former as “dreams” and the latter asextra-sensory perception (ESP) in the precise incidenceof impressions not utilizing the body’s physical senses.Rather such occasions are a Thought-Field (TF)phenomenon. 83Such ESP awareness and communication occursthrough the khabit-emanation of one or more MSs, and is“shadowed” in the physical brain of the incarnate byTheta-wave activity. 84 It is the khabit that both causes and is sensitive toOU-disturbances such as “ghosts” and“haunted houses”, which also explains why suchsensitivity is more developed in some incarnates thanothers.2. The Left-Hand PathThe LHP is based upon the principle of isolate-selfconsciousness - “the Gift of Set” - and its exploration,83 Concerning TFs see C#5.B.4 herein. Concerning the related Life-Fields (LF) ordering and maintaining the consistency of an incarnatebeing’s physical body, see C#5.B.2 and, for more detail, MindWar.84 The correlation of Theta to ESP was discovered by the Sovietpsychiatrist Dr. Dmitry G. Mirza in his four secret KGB laboratories.Cf. Ostrander & Schroeder’s Psychic Discoveries Behind the IronCurtain (1970) and Michael Murphy’s An End to Ordinary History(1982).- 165 -exercise, and maximization. It seeks to evolve theinitiated human from self-aware animal to a god.This aspiration is not as preposterous as humansconditioned to faith [for it is a de facto religious faith] intheir complete OU subjugation docilely accept. In fact thereality is completely the opposite: Every individualexercise of will, of choice, of discretion, and above-all ofcreation is a manifestation of the Gift. Any thought,expression, or action which is not the product of OU-stimulated instinct flexes the Gift.Humans’ failure to appreciate this phenomenon ispartly the result of masochistic self-indoctrination, butalso the seeming minimal impact of the Gift against theintimidation vastness and omnipresence of the OU, andof course the relentless barrage of perceptions of personalidentity only as the sum-total of OU-bodily senses and 4Ddisplacement boundaries.Without seeing it as “initiation”, self-maximizingindividuals already defy OU-prison conditioning, mostobviously in the creative arts. Every Wagner opera, ClarkAshton Smith poem, Paul Kantner song, Jules Vernenovel, Expressionist film or painting strains if not indeedbreaks the chains. The more extraordinary the“violation”, to be sure, the more taxing the energy andconcentration demanded. The inertia and “gravity” of theOU are strong and relentless, and the human body istheir creature.Formal LHP initiation thus realizes that this samebody is a chain, a prison-cell. The Gift cannot becompletely free and omnipotent until the chain is broken,the cell escaped.Paradoxically and importantly, however, it is this veryenvironment of an OU body that enables each Set-createdMS to become aware of itself. The body provides a pointof reference, both in itself and externally, for the MS touse to discern what it is vs. what it isn’t. A fish who has- 166 -known nothing but its ocean-existence has no concept of“water” until it jumps into the air [or has the misfortuneto be caught].LHP incarnates, whether artists or initiates,experience the exhilaration of their occasional “jumpsinto the air”. If they are seen to be too threatening toconventionality, however - or as H.G. Wells ominouslystorytold it, sighted men in “The Country of the Blind” -they can expect to be “caught fish” and have theiroffending eyes put out. Each LHP adventurer walks atightrope throughout his incarnation; only uponsuccessful transition to Neter-Xertet does he become freenot just of the OU prison but of its guards.The challenge of LHP initiation is therefore to extractthe maximum utility from one’s OU-incarnation, and notto abort it prematurely. Every exercise of one’s presencethough physical mechanism strengthens and refines self-definition.Equally emphatically the many avenues the physicalsenses provide for communication and interaction withother forma of life, and æsthetic appreciation of nonlivingphenomena of vast beauty and utility, must not beprematurely cast aside, whether from unfamiliarity,impatience, or indolence. The OU “ordeal” exists for avery essential and vital reason. Preemptively aborting it isnot a “sin”, but it is the waste of a unique and invaluableopportunity.If the incarnate experience of the LHP artist or initiateis more demanding than that of his RHP counterpart,postincarnation both magnifies and relieves this tension.The LHP MS now finds itself in a medium completely ofits own generation: a Subjective Universe (SU) in which itis the defining neter.As daunting as it sounds, an emergent LHP MStherefore faces the prospect of creating its own SU, oreven multiple SUs. It can also blend these with the OU of- 167 -the natural neteru, or with SUs of other LHP MSs -including the “Form”-SU of Set himself. The old physical-incarnate constraints and energies of the OU no longerapply, except insofar as a MS may elect to observe them.Thus whereas a RHP MS feels no inclination to ignoreor violate the harmony of the natural- neteru OU, a LHPMS may elect to behave much the same for the most part,but reserving the discretion to veer off from it in SUingenuity as inspiration occurs.There is no limit to the richness of an individually-created SU, of course, and it may have direction andpurpose or be delightfully random. I can think of nobetter example of such an SU as rendered in English thanClark Ashton Smith’s magnificent The Hashish-Eater,readily available in both book and Internet-onlineformats. If you elect LHP transition to your personaldivinity and immortality, this is very much the “canvas”that awaits you.I. Meta-MorphosisThe moment when the MS discards the physical body,e.g. [physical] “death” is less agreed-upon than mosthumans suppose.In 1981 a Commissioners’ Conference on Unites StatesLaws proposed a model state law entitled the UniformDetermination of Death Act, since adopted by some butnot all states. It reads:An individual who has sustained either (1)irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratoryfunctions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions ofthe entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. Adetermination of death must be made in accordance withaccepted medical standards.- 168 -This suffices in the OU to discard bodies no longer inuse by their MSs, but it is an unsubstantiated overreachof OU materialism to claim that the absence of brain-electricity proves the obliteration of the mind, i.e.consciousness - which as shown herein is a field85, not aphysical mechanism.MindStar argues this from the Egyptian-metaphysicalmethodology of anamnesis, but for those humans stillunfamiliar with and thus hesitant to rely upon it, thematerialism-myth is easily refutable in conventional,exoteric language as well:1. Brain activity isn’t the same as thinking, feeling, orseeing.2. No one has remotely shown how molecules acquire thequalities of the mind.3. It is impossible to construct a theory of the mind basedon material objects that somehow became conscious.4. When the brain lights up, its activity is like a radiolighting up when music is played. It is an obvious fallacyto say that the radio composed the music. What is beingviewed is only a physical correlation, not a cause. 86MS/brain separation can originate with either thelower function of the khat or the higher of the ab:85 Cf. Chapter #5.B.4. For instance physical sensory & body-functional mechanisms can be traced to specific sections of the brain,but thoughts and memories cannot be localized, nor measured interms of access speed/complexity.86 Deepak Chopra, M.D., FACP, and Dr. Rudolph E. Tanzi, Ph.D.,Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy, Professor of Neurology, HarvardMedical School Director, Genetics and Aging at MassachusettsGeneral Hospital (MGH), “Good News: You Are Not Your Brain”,The Huffington Post, May 27, 2012.- 169 -1. Khat-alystThis is the disconnection with which humans arecommonly, if not conscientiously familiar. It is what isregarded as “natural death”, especially when the “soul” isbelieved either not to exist at all (atheism, agnosticism),or to exist in only a very vague, crude way (J/C, etc.mythology).a. Khat-alepsyThe khat can cease to interact between the body andthe other, higher emanations if the body “wears out”, e.g.“natural causes”. In the most comfortable circumstancesthis transpires with peaceful unconsciousness or sleep. Inmore advanced, civilized countries it may be anticipatedand eased further with “palliative” care and/or drugs.b. Khat-astropheSufficient damage to the body, as in accident, war, ormurder, disrupts the functionality of the khat, such thatthe other emanations are also “cast adrift”, as well assensing in their several avenues the traumatic shock andpain of the body. While these vanish upon disconnection,a return to MS cohesion of the non- khat emanationsrequires that much more concentration, while the body-attached khat may be temporarily or permanentlyincoherent depending upon the degree of physicaldamage.2. Ab-solutionIn more refined interrelationships between the MSand its indwelled body, the passive failure of the khat-linkage is replaced by one of deliberate disengagement, as- 170 -accomplished by the ab-emanation. This may beapproximated as the MS “asserting full control of thebody”, and then retiring its activity in a single, smooth“discontinuation”.a. Ab-senseA purely ab-controlled transition, achievable in someindividuals of high initiation, is illustrated by the “Secretof the Golden Flower” (C#5.C.1).The ab eschews violence to either the khat or thebody. In The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien assertsthis capability as one of the privileges of the passing“Atlantean” race of Númenor [emphasis mine]:At last Aragorn felt the approach of old age and knewthat the span of his life-days was drawing to an end, longthough it had been.Then Aragorn said to Arwen: “At last, Lady Evenstar,fairest in this world, and most beloved, my world is fading.Lo! we have gathered, and we have spent, and now thetime of payment draws near.”Arwen knew well what he intended, and long hadforeseen it; nevertheless she was overborne by her grief.“Would you then, Lord, leave your people that live by yourword?”“Not before my time,” he answered, “for if I will notgo now, then I must soon go perforce. And Eldarion ourson is a man full-ripe for kingvship.”Then, going to the House of the Kings on the SilentStreet, Aragorn laid him down on the long bed preparedfor him.Then he said farewell to Eldarion and gave into hishands the winged crown of Gondor and the sceptre ofArnor.Then all left him save Arwen, who stood to plead withhim to stay for awhile. She was not yet weary of her days,and thus she tasted the bitterness of the mortality that shehad taken upon herself.“Lady Undómiel,” said Aragorn, “the hour is indeedhard, yet it was made even in that day when we met underthe white birches in the garden of Elrond where none now- 171 -walks. And on the hill of Cerin Amroth when we forsookboth the Shadow and the Twilight, this doom wasaccepted.“Take counsel with yourself, Beloved, and askwhether you would indeed have me wait until I wither andfall from my high seat unmanned and wittless.“Nay, Lady, I am the last of the Númenoreans and thelatest King of the Elder Days. To me has been given notonly a span thrice that of the Men of Middle-earth, but alsothe grace to go at my will, and give back the gift. Now,therefore, I will sleep.“I speak no comfort to you, for there is naught forsuch pain within the circles of the world.“The uttermost choice is before you: to repent and goto the Havens and bear away into the West the memory ofour days together, that shall there be evergreen but nevermore than memory; or else to abide the Doom of Men.”“Nay, dear Lord, that choice is long over. There is nowno ship that would bear me hence, and I must abide theDoom of Men whether I will or I nill: the loss and thesilence.“But I say to you, King of the Númenoreans: Not untilnow have I understood the tale of your people and theirfall. As wicked fools I scorned them, but I pity them at last.For if this is indeed, as the Eldar say, the gift of the One toMen, it is bitter to receive.”“So it seems,” he said, “but let us not be overthrown atthe final test, who of old renounced the Shadow and theRing.“In sorrow we must go, but not in despair. Behold!we are not bound for ever to the circles of theworld, and beyond them is more than memory.Farewell!”“Estel, Estel!” she cried; and with that, even as hetook her hand and kissed it, he fell into sleep. 87As a devout Catholic, whose Ainulindalë echoed JohnMilton’s creation-epic of God/ Eru and his angels/ Ainur,Tolkien could be expected to lament the BBS “Doom ofMen” that Aragorn and Arwen had been assured awaited87 Tolkien, J.R.R., The Lord of the Rings. New York: HoughtonMifflin, 1954 et seq., Collector’s Edition, Appendix A.I. “NúmenoreanKings”, pages 3343-4.- 172 -both of them as humans. What they didn’t know had beenrevealed by King Angmar (formerly Ar-Pharazôn theGolden) to the Wizard Pallando the Blue, at Barad-dûr inMordor, shortly before the siege of Minas Tirith, 3019 ofthe Third Age:I often wonder, Blue Wizard, at how little of Númenorwas known either to the Ainur in Valinor or to the severalraces and realms of Middle-earth. Had it been otherwise,that island might still be above the waves of the Belegaertoday, nor Beleriand itself broken. The Men of Númenorhad, in their three thousands of years as a culture, grownbeyond the Men, Elves, Dwarves, and other beings here,and indeed beyond also the Valar in Aman themselves.Before you disbelieve, for I see that you would, rememberthat the Elves, beautiful of form and immortal upon Ardaas they may be, are yet thus bounded in their existence. Asfor the Valar, while they may bend and hurt this worldmightily, still dare they not but as allowed by Eru Ilúvatar,to whose mindless, changeless service they are eternallyenthralled, save only one.But we Dúnedain - for indeed I am Númenorean -discovered that, though our lives be limited on this world,neither are our bodies entwined with it as the Elves andDwarves. We Men are not thus imprisoned to it, but by ourwill may continue beyond it through all dimensions anddistances of the universe. Nor are our minds condemnednever to venture beyond that of Eru Ilúvatar, as are thoseof the Ainur - save only one. Indeed, Blue Wizard, as youare of the Maiar, I speak here beyond your own ability tocomprehend. But this that you cannot understand is theGift and Doom of Men, and that is what Númenor learned,and that is why the Valar feared, and destroyed,Númenor.88What Aragorn did not know, therefore, was thatwithin his Earthmortal body burned the immortality ofnot just the “circles” of the OU created by Eru Ilúvatar88 Ash nazg, Morlindalë. San Francisco: Barony of Rachane, 2003,The Fifth Scroll, pages #108-9.- 173 -(“the One”) and ordered by the [natural] Ainur, but of theSU-creative Gift of Melkor.Further that, in relinquishing her Quendi (Elven) Life-force for that of Númenorean Mankind, she had freed herMS from its OU-bounded continuation to the limitlessBeing now before Aragorn. 89b. Ab-senceUnfortunately for post-Númenor humans, the abilityto simply ab-dicate one’s body at will has been lost alongwith that thrice-span incarnation. The closestapproximation is accomplished by body-deactivationpharmaceuticals, e.g. “physician-assisted suicide” (PAS).While one might sensibly expect this to be a routine,personal-discretionary procedure for mature/sane adults,this is almost nowhere the case, even in the early 21stCentury CE, because of both profane-religious andnation/state insistence that human life is theirs -certainly not the affected individual’s! - to give or take.At most, and then subject to draconian, grudgingrestrictions, PAS may be permitted by a few states [butnever by profane religion] in cases of imminent,extremely-agonizing expiration from disease or injury.Beloved pets may receive the mercy of a gentle VASdrift-off to the Rainbow Bridge90 from no-longer-89 That at the very last, despite a lifetime of J/C Catholicism, Tolkienhimself experienced and expressed this Nœsis (my highlighting)gruntles me. For Aragorn to follow it with “Farewell!” thus seemslittle more than disingenuous dramatics. “Back in a moment after Ichange from khat to khabit!” would have been more to the point,though requiring Arwen to come up with a less-tragic rejoinder.90 At the Rainbow Bridge, Earth family-animal MSs await theirhumans in a serene, secure, and healing setting. The Bridge gets itsname from the bodies of spectral-light which replace the animals’cast-off OU ones. When in this form an animal rushes to greet itshuman, it is sometimes visible from Earth as a “shooting star”.- 174 -operational bodies, but rarely if ever is this same mercyavailable to their human family.Scenarios in which individual humans own their ownbodies are still in the realm of science-fiction.In the 1973 motion picture Soylent Green, Edward G.Robinson - as an elderly gentleman tired of life in anoverpopulated, environmentally-degraded near-future, isable to patronize a courteous and comforting suicidefacility: He drinks a lethal cocktail and reclines on acomfortable bed to drift off to “light classical” music andprojected vistas of bygone natural beauty and serenity.One day perhaps this will become the civilized standard. 91Soylent Green was anticipated in 1895 by Robert W.Chambers, who in his legendary collection of outré shortstories The King in Yellow was not optimistic about thenew century:In the winter of 1901 began that agitation for therepeal of the laws prohibiting suicide which bore its finalfruit in the month of April 1920, when the firstGovernment Lethal Chamber was opened in New York onWashington Square ... 92In the 1976 film Logan’s Run, PAS was portrayed as asystematic state deception to prevent over-population bykilling everyone at age 30 in a fake “reincarnation”ceremony. The cynical reality, of course, was the BBS.91 On the other hand, after Edward expired his corpse was conveyer-belted to a large vat in which it was cooked with others to create the“Soylent Green” crackers distributed to the food-desperate populace.When Charlton Heston protested that “Soylent Green is people!”, hewas ignored and arrested.92 Chambers, Robert W., The King in Yellow. New York: F. TennysonNeely, 1895, page #11.- 175 -The following year George Lucas’ Star Wars retainedthe BBS for ordinary humans & aliens, but exemptedinitiates, the “Jedi”, who could in/dis/recarnate at will. 93But in the 21st Century CE in this galaxy, body-bondage still prevails. For such mature and responsibleguidance as does exist, two standard, regularly-updatedreference books are Final Exit by Derek Humphry andThe Peaceful Pill Handbook by Dr. Philip Nitschke & Dr.Fiona Stewart.Neither book advocates nor encourages suicide; theyexist primarily to warn readers against known dangers,risks, and exploitations in subject areas so susceptibleto rumor, misinformation, and cold-blooded fraud.They do not “preach” either pro or con; they assumeand expect the reader to be responsible for personaldecisions.Similarly MindStar’s intent in identifying these worksis simply and specifically protection of readers. Whilerejecting unjustified fears of “death”, MindStar maintainsthat decisions concerning it should be reached only withthe greatest of care and understanding.On subjects such as this there will always come apoint where the reader is either trusted or not. Education,experience, ethics, and responsibility to oneself as well asothers all play a part. But “the buck stops with you”.J. PrescienceWith physical “death” looming so prominently andinevitably before all humans, one would expectconsiderable and careful attention to it. That this is93 Lucas borrowed “Jedi” from the [non-initiate] Jeddak (warrior-king) or Jeddara (-queen) of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Mars novels.Since Star Wars does not explain this capacity of Jedis, I do inFireForce.- 176 -anything but the norm obviously follows from BBSpropaganda and the terror it generates.Assuming that MindStar has substantially, if notcompletely alleviated this masochism, what are some ofthe generalities that merit a prudent individual’s interest?1. PrudenceAs with other major factors affecting your existenceand activities, generally the sooner you begin tocontemplate this subject and its many ramifications, thebetter.Your incarnate presence affects others as well asyourself, so any plans and options should includeappropriate attention to their “ripples”. Make it a point todialogue with impacted-others. The more you do this, theeasier and more conversational it will become, withoutbeing “morbid”. Indeed as you become comfortable inyour own case, others may learn from your example.2. PracticalityIt is not the function of MindStar to be a “checklist” ofphysical-“death” tasks, plans, legal & funeralarrangements, etc. There is plenty of professional,specialized literature on such subjects, as well asprofessional services.Since discarding one’s body is not a reversible action,especial attention should be paid to maximizing its healthand versatility while you do have access to and controlover it. The body is an invaluable, unique tool foridentifying and exploring your concept, perception, andfull exercise of existence and OU-extension. Neverunderestimate nor underappreciate this.- 177 -3. PageantryPreviously and incidentally MindStar has mentionedpomp & ceremony associated with “death”: funerals,commemorative holidays, awards & medals, parties,parades, orations, and of course profane-religiousfetishism.Some of this is sentimental, some BBS fear-reaction,some financial or etc. exploitation. Since you’re the starof the show, by all means get pre-involved in activities,invitations, budgets. Decide your own disposition andtomb. King Tutankhamen proved that you can take itwith you, so decide on accoutrements, decoration,memorabilia. If archæologists discover and dig up yourtomb 5,000 years from now, what would you like them tofind94 and try to figure out?95In the 21st Century artificial-intelligence andminiaturized technology are fast reaching the point wherea holographic “you” will be able to greet visitors, chattingappropriately with b0th the desired and the detested,including personal messages for the face-recognized.Imhotep may have needed the Scroll of Thoth and Kharisnine Tana-leaves, but all “you” will require is a suitable“app” hooked up to a nearby solar panel.

States of LifeIn Isha Schwaller de Lubicz’ Her-Bak, the chronicle ofan ancient Egyptian youth’s education from profane topriest, he is exposed to increasingly more complexaspects of existence, all of which leads him towards theultimate mystery of his own conscious existence, its OUperspective, and his gradual realization that his own SU isa “thing apart” from the natural order of the OU neteru.- 180 -“What is man?” he asks. “If man is the most completebeing on Earth, I ought, knowing this, to know all else;but I’m a man and I don’t know myself. I don’t know whoor what is in me.” The Sage (a Priest of Isis) responds:What is life? It is a form of the divine presence. It isthe power, immanent in created things, to changethemselves by successive destructions of form until thespirit or activating force of the original life-stream isfreed.This power resides in the very nature of things.Successive destruction of forms, metamorphoses, bythe divine fire with rebirth of forms new and living isan expression of consciousness. It is the spiritual aim ofall human life to attain a state of consciousness that isindependent of bodily circumstance.What I have just said concerns the living spiritbestowed on the man already quickened, like everyliving thing, by a rudimentary soul, which makes ofsuch a man a creature superior to the animal-humankingdom.He who recognizes the divine meaning of life knowsthat knowledge has but one aim, which is to achieve thesuccessive stages that liberate him from the perishable.For things die only in their body; the spirit, the divineWord, returns to its source and dies not.Unhappy is the kea that fails to recover its soul. 96Such an explanation generally represents theperspective of the OU priesthoods, who sought tointerpret and explain humanity within that universe.They were forced to conceptualize incarnate humanity asa temporary particularization of the general OU, eachsuch human uncomfortably aware of this tension andstriving to eliminate it through re-absorption into theOU. While this Sage suggests that this is done bysuccessive, progressively-more-refined incarnations (a96 Schwaller de Lubicz, Isha, Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate. New York:Inner Traditions, 1967, page #35.- 181 -general premise of reincarnationism), there is little inoriginal Egyptian metaphysics to support this. 97Had Her-Bak’s initiation been into the Priesthood ofSet rather than that of Isis, he would presumably havebeen answered much in the vein of this book; but thatwould have necessitated a far different exposure to theOU reality surrounding him than he received. Repeatedlyand remorselessly his complete separateness would havebeen dramatized to him, removing the reassuring andrelaxing prospect of both incarnate and disincarnate OU-inclusion.Thus Setian initiation exposes and incites a crisis inthe initiate which initiation through the other, naturalneteru avoids. This crisis is definitive and exhilarating tothe Setian mentality, but can be devastating to one of theother neteru. As starkly summarized by H.P. Lovecraft:Life is a hideous thing, and from the backgroundbehind what we know of it peer dæmoniacal hints oftruth which make it sometimes a thousandfold morehideous. Science, already oppressive with its shockingrevelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminatorof our human species -- if separate species we be -- forits reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borneby mortal brains if loosed upon the world. 98As we have seen, conventional visions of post-incarnate immortality tend to the OU-totality model,fumbling between either immediate OU-reabsorption or97 In Secrets of the Great Pyramid Peter Tompkins has suggestedthat a crucial rationale of Egyptian mummification was precisely toprevent further terrestrial reincarnation. Permanent preservation ofthe body gave the more material emanations the anchor they neededuntil the multifaceted MS could fully integrate itself in a completelyindependent environment.98 Lovecraft, H.P., “Arthur Jermyn” in Dagon and Other MacabreTales. Sauk City: Arkham House, 1965, page #47.- 182 -some sequence of progressive or karma-varyingterrestrial reincarnation. In the absence of a non-naturaltelos, humanity is forced into either free-will ordeterministic OU-Mechanism. Envisioning immortalitywithin such constraints leads to only one result:dissolution of the self, the independent consciousness.To the OU-initiate this is indeed expected and evenanticipated, often with the assumption that one’spersonality will not in fact be extinguished, but rathermelded into that of the collective gods/God. Such anoutcome would indeed relieve the tension andexclusiveness of separateness; it is less comprehensiblehow it would permit any vestige of the previously-individual life-being to continue.In his book Life After Death, the eminent philosopherMaurice Maeterlinck addressed his perceived relianceupon bodily definition of self:I care not if the loftiest, the freest, the fairestportions of my mind be eternally living and radiant inthe supreme gladness; they are no longer mine; I donot know them. Death has cut the network of nerves ormemories that connected them with I know not whatcenters wherein lies the point which I feel to be my veryself. They are thus set loose, floating in space and time;and their fate is as alien to me as that of the mostdistant stars.Yet Maeterlinck is not so certain that the physicalbody’s materials and mechanisms are the whole story. Hesenses that the entirety of himself is more than the sumof such tangible physical parts, and indeed may becompletely apart and distinct from them, using them onlyas an OU-interactive device. He continues:All that befalls has no existence for me unless I canrecall it within that mysterious being which is I knownot where and precisely nowhere and which I turn like- 183 -a mirror about this world whose phenomena take shapeonly insofar as they are reflected in it. 99Maeterlinck used the term “ego” [in a non-Freudiansense] to refer to this individual identity somewhere/somehow beyond the purely physical, in which he defined“mind” as physically-driven brain functioning:This ego, as we conceive it when we reflect upon theconsequences of its destruction - this ego, therefore, isneither our mind nor our body, since we recognize thatboth are waves that roll by and are incessantlyrenewed. Is it an immovable point, which could not beform or substance, for these are always in evolution,nor yet life, which is the cause or effect of form andsubstance?In truth it is impossible for us either to apprehendor define it, or even to say where it dwells. When we tryto go back to its last source, we find little more than asuccession of memories, a mass of ideas, confused, forthat matter, and unsettled, all connected with the sameinstinct, the instinct of living: a mass of habits of oursensibility and of conscious or unconscious reactionsagainst the surrounding phenomena.When all is said, the most steadfast point of thatnebula is our memory, which seems, on the other hand,to be a somewhat external, a somewhat accessoryfaculty and, in any case, one of the frailest faculties ofour brain, one of those which disappear the mostpromptly at the least disturbance of our health. As anEnglish poet has very truly said, “That which criesaloud for eternity is the very part of me that willperish.” 100Maeterlinck was, however, falling into - or, rather,setting for himself - the same logical trap that imprisons99 Maeterlinck, Maurice, Our Eternity. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1914,pages #50-51.100 Ibid., pages #48-49.- 184 -contemporary Mechanists: that memory is completely aproduct and construct of OU interactions through thephysical senses. Eliminating them eliminates it.Implicit in this limitation is the assumption that OU-based, and presumably buttressed, memory is the only“real” memory. Anything else is merely imaginative, andas such must be kept carefully and strictly segregatedfrom the “real”. If the two are confused, or worse yetdeliberately dignified with the same reality, the individualis “insane”.The same holds true for time-assignments of memoryevents. If one remembers an event, it may or may not beconsciously or subconsciously dated. Remembering yourdate from your high school prom associates that OU datewith the memory creation. But remembering somethingnot so inherently fixed in time, such as a favorite locationvisited repeatedly over years, does not carry a specificdate. You may store enough short-term memory to becertain you haven’t seen it within the last year or so, butthat is merely external-exclusionary.Also there is no reliable division in terms of precisionbetween short-term and long-term memory. It’s effortlessto remember the multiplication table you learned in thethird grade. Yesterday’s credit-card charge at thesupermarket? Not unless you gave it special “retentive”attention at the time.All of which is to say that memory is neither objectivenor reliable, and that there is no certain mechanism toensure or correct either problem.With Maeterlinck’s trust in memory-as-self undercut,the individual is reduced to instantaneous sensation ofseparateness to establish conscious identity. This is RenéDescartes’ cogito ergo sum at its most fundamental. It isnot thinking “of something”, whether real or imaginary,- 185 -that establishes individual consciousness; it is theexercise of thinking itself. 101But confirming that one exists is only the smile of theCheshire Cat. What distinguishes and differentiates youfrom innumerable other separate consciousnesses? Againthe Mechanist’s habit is to default to his OU body. “I amwhat exists within and uses this machine.” Nevertheless,as we have already seen, this is not at all a unitaryrelationship. Parts of the body can be inactivated orr e m o v e d w i t h o u t a f f e c t i n g t h e w h o l e n e s s o fconsciousness, and during sleep or anesthesia theconsciousness disconnects from all of the body’s physical-sense interfaces.We are left with an “essential self” which we thoughtwe knew through a mixture of reliable memories andconstantly-reinforcing body sensations. We now realizethat both are fragmentary, imperfect, unreliable illusions.B. Sensory DeprivationDuring the mid-20th century John Lilly, M.D. devisedand conducted numerous experiments with sensorydeprivation tanks to determine whether anyconsciousness remained, and if so in what form, oncebodily sensory im/expression had been eliminated. Lillypursued this with several students and colleagues overthe years, and discussed the results and his conclusionsin his 1977 book The Deep Self. Which in turn inspiredhis playful caricature in the novel/film Altered States:101 Rejecting the “disincarnate origin” of thinking as establishment ofpersonal existence and identity, Martin Heidegger proposed that self-perception requires external displacement: “being there” ( Dasein) inorder to subsequently conceive itself through a composite of “what itisn’t” reflections. This may console those unnerved by Descartes, butultimately does not refute him. Something with the innate capacity toperceive must preexist any external input.- 186 -I’m a man in search of his true self. Howarchetypically American can you get? Everybody’slooking for his true self. We’re all trying to fulfillourselves, understand ourselves, get in touch withourselves, get ahold of ourselves, face the reality ofourselves, explore ourselves, expand ourselves. Eversince we dispensed with God, we’ve got nothing butourselves to explain this meaningless horror of life.We’re all weekending at est or meditating for fortyminutes a day or squatting on floors in a communalOM or locking arms in quasi-Sufi dances or strippingoff the deceptions of civilized life and jumping nakedinto a swimming pool filled with other naked searchersfor self. Well, I think that true self, that original self,that first self, is a real, mensurate, quantifiable thing,tangible and incarnate. And I’m going to find thefucker! - Edward Jessup, Ph.D. (after several glasses ofwine)102Lilly associated his quest for the self with the problemof “reality”. Assuming, per Descartes, that theconsciousness is a constant, active phenomenon, prior toand independent of what it perceives and constructsthrough the physical senses, the task is then to pare theirrelevant and unnecessary clutter away, resulting in thattrue, raw reality. In The Deep Self he sums up theconclusions of his investigations [and earlier writings]thus:In the province of the mind, what one believes to betrue either is true or becomes true within certain limits.These limits are to be found experientially andexperimentally. When the limits are determined, it isfound that they are further beliefs to be transcended. In102 Chayefsky, Paddy, Altered States (New York: Harper & Row,1978), page #44.- 187 -the province of he mind there are no limits. The bodyimposes definite limits. 103Previously Lilly had written:Today reality may be said (in its less involvedmeanings) to possess the same attributes as theoriginal meaning of the [Latin word] res (“a lawcourt”).First it expresses that which is completely objective asopposed to anything subjective. By “objective” we mean“existing without the mind, outside it, and whollyindependent of it”. “Subjective”, on the other hand,takes the meaning of that which is in the mind ...How can the mind render itself sufficiently"},{"pageContent":"objective to study itself? In other words, how are weable to use the mind to ponder on the mind? It isperfectly feasible for the intellect to grasp the fact thatthe physiological changes of the brain occursimultaneously with thought, but it cannot conceive ofthe connection between its own thoughts and thesechanges. The difficulties of the precise relation betweenthe two have caused many controversies as to which isthe more real, the objective or the subjective reality. 104[index_split_009.html#p187]Lilly had indeed succeeded in “finding the fucker”,showing scientifically that “reality” is a composite of OUand SU interpretations and constructs. His research wasof course purely on an individual level. Having verified it,he found himself at a bit of a loss as to what to do with hisdiscovery. At the culmination of Altered States, thehapless Dr. Jessup is reduced to a protoplasmic “primalself” so unconstrained that it is like a mental atomiccritical mass. He is just barely rescued from this state byhis wife, who then collapses in hysteria:103 Lilly, John C. M.D., The Deep Self. New York: Warner Books,1977, page #63.104 Ibid., pages #67-8.- 188 -He’s a truth-lover, a God fucker. I was never real tohim. Nothing in the human condition was ever real tohim. Reality to Eddie is only that which is changeless,immutably constant. What happened to him tonight -that was Eddie’s idea of love. That was consummation.He finally got it off with God. He finally embraced theAbsolute, was finally ravished by Truth. And it fuckingnear destroyed him. 105C. MindStar VisionsThe Setian initiate, bypassing all conditioned OU-dependencies, is challenged to first recognize, thendifferentiate, then identify his immortal consciousnesswith those parts of the eightfold emanations which arenever connected to the physical body’s functions, henceare not affected by its death or disintegration.This is accomplished through reflective, non-reactive thinking. Thus the individual becomes awareof his authentic self (MS); and upon activating this as thelocus of his consciousness, looks outward at phenomenaat the same depth.In other words, the superficial “self” looks out at itslevel and sees OU events - like bodily pleasure/pain, bluesky, ringing telephones, time defined by clocks andcalendars, and so forth.The core or true self, however, exists as a neter and,when looking outward, sees a SU not of the works ofother neteru, but of those neteru themselves.One “machine” sees other “machinery”; one “creator/operator” sees other “creator/operators”.The Egyptians might describe such inward, reflectivethinking as the accessing of the ba or core-MS by the khator body-soul: the Platonic phenomenon of anamnesis asthe khat, which normally exists and defines itself in an105 Chayefsky, op. cit. , page #167.- 189 -environment of bodily dimensions and sensations, notonly reaches beyond that environment but in somesituations depends upon the ba for a more accuratesource of truth.To “deny one’s senses” is a familiar experience formost people in certain situations, though they may notrealize what such a gesture actually entails in terms ofmental coherence. When done, it is almost always briefand minimal, because the khat’s reliance upon bodilysenses for its information and both definition andcontinuous reinforcement of “reality” is so strong andingrained.Unless the khat-ba connection is both a conscious anda strong one, the individual may interpret such anexperience as mere loss of coherence, or “insanity”.Immortality of the self is. Your ability to align yourconsciousness with your neter, rather than yoursuperficial, animal, illusion of “self” is Xeper, theapprehension and affirmation of your telos.We have seen how these ancient initiatory keys toimmortality were energetically attacked and suppressedby institutional Christianity, as that religion correctlyperceived that fear of death was one of the most powerfulweapons it could use to enslave adherents and converts.It was crucial that death be taught as something fearsomeand final, from which the only salvation was surrender toChrist - by which, of course, Christian churches reallymeant their institutions.Those areas of non-Christian Europe which hadescaped, at least for a time, domination by this terrifyingpropaganda, continued to preserve the truth. In ForFreedom Destined Dr. Franz Winkler observes:In ancient times the secrets of man’s true nature,and of the forces that determine his fate, werecontemplated in the great temple universities ofpaganism all over the civilized world.- 190 -Though men were fully aware of the important rolethat heredity plays in the shaping of the physiologicaland psychological organism of a human being, they didnot think that the innermost core of the human beingwas the product of purely biological forces. Thisinnermost core, called by the Greeks the entelechy ordæmon of man, was credited with qualities unique tothe individual, apart from the characteristics of thebody he inhabited. The concept of entelechycorresponded roughly with the Judæo-Christianconcept of an immortal soul.Most pagan creeds held that the human entelechyneither begins nor ends with life on Earth. Man’s“mortality” referred merely to the fact that his self-awareness ceased with the death of his body.The immortal gods differed from mortal man by thecontinuation of their consciousness.Since ancient ideas on the mystery of birth cannotbe separated from pagan philosophies about the soul’ssupersensible existence, certain concepts generallyaccepted in the pre-Christian era should be mentioned.According to pagan theology, consciousness afterdeath could reach one of three levels.The first level was the one allotted to the averageman: dreamlike, with almost complete absence ofmemory and self-identification, called Hades in Greek,Hel in Germanic mythology.The second was accessible to the true hero, the manwhose deeds of courage and creativeness distinguishedhim from ordinary mortals. The Greeks called this stateof consciousness the Elysian Fields, the GermansWalhalla.The third level was reached by those who could soarb e y o n d t h e n a r r o w l i m i t s o f E a r t h - b o u n dconsciousness and thus bring new impulses into theworld. Already while they still lived in a mortal body,their awareness had assumed divine status. Their souls- 191 -after death, in the language of mythology, were lifted tothe stars. 106Is attainment of the immortality of the ba or psyche atechnique which the individual has to “learn”? Must onehurry to do so, lest one’s body expire before the transitionis mastered? Quite the contrary, as the Sage in Her-Bakemphasized: This immortality is innate in allconscious beings. You possess it already, by evidenceof that same consciousness which enables you to read andcomprehend these words. It is nothing which initiation,either Setian or natural, “confers” on you; rather it issomething to which conventional churches have resolvedto blind you, and which materialistic science has deniedsimply because it is an aspect of existence whichtranscends that science. Further from Winkler:Life’s appearance as “meaningless” stems basicallyfrom man’s materialistic concept of himself. If hisinnermost nature were merely biological, completefulfillment of his appetites and the acquiring of wealthwould satisfy his longing for happiness. Since they donot, an atmosphere of hopelessness is enveloping ourgeneration, especially our youth. In an affluent societywhere all material ways out of such frustration havebeen found wanting, drugs, perversions, and the thrillsof crime are now being used as desperate means ofescape from the intolerable boredom. Well-meaningefforts on the part of the authorities to stem the tidalwave of juvenile delinquency and drug-addiction willtherefore bring scant results, until the following simpletruth has been fully accepted by parents and teachers:Happiness, love, and compassion are spiritualfaculties that during centuries of neglect andmisunderstanding have withered and grown weak.Unless they are nursed back to health, man will despair106 Winkler, Franz E., For Freedom Destined: Mysteries of Man’sEvolution in the Mythology of Wager’s Ring Operas and Parsifal.Garden City, NY: Waldorf Press, 1974, pages #54-55.- 192 -of life and eventually throw it away in a mass suicide bynuclear destruction.But how can we care for what we no longercomprehend?Modern science, admirable in its achievements on amaterial plane, has proven ineffectual in theunderstanding of intangible values. This limitation,while freely admitted by the small number of trulycreative scientists, seems to elude the averageintellectual. And the failure to recognize this limitationadds to the delusion that natural science in its presentform can be the judge of religious or spiritual truth.Making modern man’s plight even more serious isthe fact that his materialistic delusion of himself notonly deprives him of wisdom and happiness, but actsalso as a pattern in whose dreary image he tends toreshape his nature. Consequently more and morepersonalities emerge who think and act virtually likerobots. They know no happiness and have noperception of objective morality.We have grown wise in the analysis of the materialworld, have expanded the scope of our perception toouter space and to the world beneath the atom. Butobjective inner experience has faded almost entirelyaway, and it has left us groping in the dark for the trueimage of ourselves. 107It is a function of the Temple of Set, as of the ancientEgyptian priesthoods, the Pythagorean Brotherhood, andthe Platonic Academy before it, to inspire the Elect ofhumanity to awaken to that knowledge which is latentwithin their consciousness and needs only to beappreciated as such. 108 Winkler rightly points out that,107 Ibid., pages #19-21.108 Within initiation the term “Elect” identifies an individual who hasnot merely been chosen for this transformative adventure, but whointrinsically possesses the intelligence, vision, and ambition topursue it successfully. It is thus both an active and a passivequalification.- 193 -the more highly initiated one becomes, the more one canexperience such prerogatives of Xeper. But this is amatter of perspective and proportion, not of the quality ofimmortality itself.D. Emperor of DreamsI don’t make things up, and I can’t write stories. Idaresay that if I tried to do either, the results would beawkward, clumsily and self-consciously [in the banalsense] artificial. So what are these books of mine that arecasually labeled “fiction”?Simply: SUs outlined and shared in print. And theyexemplify the flexibility of SU-creation from little if anyOU-modification - Secret of the Lost Ark, Grail Mission,We Break the Sword, and Ode to Esmé - to near-complete disassociation: Morlindalë, FireForce.Often - and I confess somewhat mischievously - Ienjoy pranking the reader with OU-facts that appearfantastic, as well as SU-constructs that have everyappearance of OU-substantiation. 109This is not just an attentiveness- and credibility-challenge to the reader, but a very serious representationof how, when we assume we perceive and interact withthe OU daily, the reality is that each individual createsand indwells a SU interpretation of the OU, sufficient torender it intelligible and practical for physicalfunctioning.Beyond each personal SU and the OU are also severalCollective SUs (CSU) (C#1.E), constructed by groups of109 There wasn’t really an article in the Los Angeles Times about thediscovery of an ancient city of lizard-beings beneath L.A. Or wasthere? Robert Fulton didn’t really build the first Nautilus forNapoleon. Or did he? The secret SS records of the Atlantis expeditionaren’t really on decaying microfilm reels in the U.S. NationalArchives. Or are they?- 194 -entities in which we participate, both voluntarily ornecessarily. As we have seen herein, many such CSUs -ideological, profane-religions, etc. - insist that they arenot CSUs but indeed the OU: an image they deemessential to their effectiveness.Once, like Her-Bak, you are awakened to and begin tounderstand this “matrix” of interleaved, interlockinguniverses, you become their controller and manipulator,not their blind, ignorant slave.At the end of this “Mind- trilogy”, as the Afterword toFindFar, appears “The Prince and the Magician”, ararely-noticed incidental in John Fowles’ The Magus. It isa Black Mass, a “red pill”, or as Fowles terms it,“disintoxication”.MindStar is also such a disintoxication. The Prefacepredicted that it would expose you to nothing whose truthyou don’t already know: anamnesis.That turned out to be the case, yes?E. The End of the BeginningMindStar has endeavored to take its subject to thelimits of conventional exposure and expression. 110Religious eschatology myths and contemporaryscience-fiction re-attempts like 2001 characteristicallyfall silent at precisely the moment when the subjectbecomes most interesting: Once you are re-created as adisincarnate, immortal being, freed from both yourmaterial body and the OU to which it was permanentlychained during your incarnation, what’s next?You’ll think of something. As Walt Disney said, “It’skind of fun to do the impossible.”The common feature of all the old superstitions -whether Hebraic, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, or etc. -110 At least, hopefully, without scaring the cats.- 195 -was that you’re in big trouble: if not just from your ownsinfulness, that of great+grandparents Adam & Eve. Yourwhole life is spent trying to get out of the Very BadEternity this promises.Or, if you shucked that all off, the Big Black Sack.Isn’t it nice to punt all of this?Millennia of foggy fablisms have also left Hereafterssurprisingly unexplored. Well, the Egyptians had Amentiand the Tuat nicely mapped out, including where not tostep if you didn’t want your ba-foot eaten by Apep.No guidebook was need for the Jewish Sheol; it’s adivine dump, a celestial cesspool for rephaim refuse.At least Christians could throw dice for Dante’s DivineComedy (!) of Paradise, Purgatory, or Inferno, for whichHieronymus Bosch and Francisco Goya were only toohappy to offset Michelangelo and da Vinci.Upon deactivation of your physical body, the khatceases to be the “default” emanation, re-centering your“sense of self” in the ba. Extension from the ba isthereafter effortless: for instance into the ka for a SUmanifestation of 4D displacement for travel throughoutthe OU or other SUs. The khabit reaches across the SU/OU boundaries if you wish varying types of “visits” fromdelicate inspiration to full-fledged ghost or house-haunter.At the onset of the American Civil War, a Unionsoldier came closer than Aragorn to anticipating thekhabit, writing to his wife:... But oh! Sarah: If the dead can come back to thisEarth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shallalways be near you in the gladdest days and in the darkestnights - always, always.And if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shallbe my breath; as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, itshall be my spirit passing by.- 196 -Sarah, do not mourn me dead. Think I am gone andwait for thee, for we shall meet again. 111Queen Tera knew well from her own initiation how toescape the perils of her original time. 112 Upon the preciseculmination of the ceremonial, incantational, andastronomical alignments combined to send her khabitunobtrusively into the 19th-Century body of Margaret113Trelawny, whose own khat had been conjured into aphysical double of the Queen’s, therein to blend delicatelyand willingly with the khabit of Margaret:In the autumn Margaret and I were married. On theoccasion she wore the mummy robe and zone and the jewelwhich Queen Tera had worn in her hair. On her breast, setin a ring of gold make like a twisted lotus stalk, she worethe strange Jewel of Seven Stars which held words toinvoke the neteru of all the worlds.At the marriage the sunlight streaming through thechancel windows fell on it, and it seemed to glow like aliving thing.The graven words may have been of efficacy; forMargaret holds to them, and there is no other life in all theworld so happy as my own.111 Letter, Sullivan to Sarah Ballou, July 14, 1861.

Herakleopolis Magna), 20miles from the successor Tanis of the Setian XX Dynasty.Queen Tera’s Arts indeed protected her, but upon her death (saidto be by her own Arts] she was entombed “namelessly” in the “Valleyof the Sorcerer” and her reign erased, shown on the Turin Papyrus as“7 empty years”. No “Mentuhotep IV” tomb has ever been found.113 Reverse the last four letters.- 197 -We often think of the great Queen, and we talk of herfreely. Once, when I said with a sigh that I was sorry shecould not have waked into a new life in a new world, mywife, putting both her hands in mine and looking into myeyes with that far-away eloquent dreamy look whichsometimes comes into her own, said lovingly:“Do not grieve for her! Who knows, but she may havefound the joy she sought? Love and patience are all thatmake for happiness in this world, or in the world of thepast or of the future; of the living or the dead.

This conversation wasrecorded, transcribed, and annotated by MichaelA. Aquino.The Sphinx: I think it essential to preface anydiscussion of a single Platonic dialogue with twomajor qualifications. The first is that, to be treatedwithout distortion, Plato’s philosophy must beappreciated in its entirety. Emphasis upon anysingle dialogue or group of dialogues carries with ita certain unfairness to the author.The Chimæra: Yet our span of materialization islimited, and we cannot hope to treat the entirerange of Plato’s thought in the time available to us.The Sphinx: True, and so let us focus first upon TheSophist, which illustrates many of the points mostimportant to this investigation.- 200 -The Chimæra: But what is your second qualification?The Sphinx: There is the problem of understandingwhat Plato “really meant”. This is an issue againstwhich I am powerless to defend myself. I am ofKhem and not of Hellas; I am bilingual only inEnglish and hence must depend upon myunderstanding of Plato as he is translated into theEnglish language. The dialogues center much oftheir discussion around terms whose finaldefinitions are elusive at best, even inconversations carried out at intellectual planesbelow that of Plato. Then, too, there is always thespectre of imprecise translation from the Greek tothe English. And Plato himself could not anticipatethis.The Chimæra: Your qualifications are entirelyacceptable. Proceed.The Sphinx: The initial question raised by The Sophistis its raison d’être. Why should Plato have felt itnecessary to include such a dialogue as this in hisphilosophy at all? Was it truly because theincluded lines of argument required exposure? Ordid Plato intend the document rather as a gauntletof sorts to be flung before the Sophiststhemselves?The Chimæra: I sense that the editors of this bookventured one explanation. Grasping it with aforepaw, he turns to page #958. Yes, here it is:The argument is hung on the figure of theSophist quite arbitrarily. No real picture is givenof the men who were the professionalinstructors of Greece for many years. All Plato- 201 -does is ascribe to them every notion hedisapproves. He detested the whole band ofSophists. To him they were shallow-minded,pretentious, superficial, mercenary - they werereally doing what Socrates was charged with,corrupting the minds of the young.And this appears to be reinforced by the dialogue’sconcluding statement, which seems to be littlemore than an outright vilification of Sophistry. Heturns to page #1016 and quotes:The art of contradiction-making, descendedfrom an insincere kind of conceited mimicry, ofthe semblance-making breed, derive fromimagemaking, distinguished as a portion, notdivine but human, of production, that presents ashadowy play of words - such are the blood andlineage which can, with perfect truth, beassigned to the authentic Sophist.The Sphinx: Obviously that is not an objectivephilosophical statement. It is a deliberate insultreached through a dialectical process which, inretrospect, seems a transparent parody of Plato’smore serious argumentative style. In most of thePlatonic dialogues one feels that Socrates is not“managing” the conversation towards an end thathe has conceptualized beforehand. But every twistand turn of The Sophist is designed only tochannel the conversation into providing a part ofthat final statement.The Chimæra: But how would you have Plato composesuch a definition, save by a summary of thecomponent arguments preceding it?- 202 -The Sphinx: I quarrel not with the final assemblyprocess, but rather with the fashion in which thecomponents themselves were forged. For, you see,there are many ways along which each of thosecomponent arguments could have proceeded.Each, however, consistently follows a pathderogatory to the Sophists. If the Sophists were infact personifications of all that is erroneous anddestructive in teaching, all possible paths wouldlead to the same conclusion, i.e. one derogatory tothe Sophists. But this is not the case at all. See - Hetakes the book from the Chimæra and turns topage #973:STRANGER: They cross-examine a man’swords, when he thinks that he is sayingsomething and is really saying nothing, andeasily convict him of inconsistencies in hisopinions; these they then collect by the dialecticprocess, and, placing them side by side, showthat they contradict one another about the samethings, in relation to the same things, and in thesame respect. He, seeing this, is angry withhimself, and grows gentle towards others, andthus is entirely delivered from greaterprejudices and harsh notions, in a way which ismost amusing to the hearer, and produces themost lasting good effect on the person who isthe subject of the operation. For as thephysician considers that the body will receive nobenefit from taking food until the internalobstacles have been removed, so the purifier ofthe soul is conscious that his patient will receiveno benefit from the application of knowledgeuntil he is refuted, and from refutation learnsmodesty; he must be purged of his prejudicesfirst and made to think that he knows only whathe knows, and no more.- 203 -THEÆTETUS: That is certainly the best andwisest state of mind.STRANGER: For all these reasons, Theætetus,we must admit that refutation is the greatestand chiefest of purifications, and he who has notbeen refuted, though he be the Great Kinghimself, is in an awful state of impurity; he isuninstructed and deformed in those things inwhich he who would be truly blessed ought to befairest and purest.THEÆTETUS: Very true.STRANGER: Well, what name shall we give tothe practitioners of this art? For my part Ishrink from calling them Sophists.THEÆTETUS: Why so?STRANGER: For fear of ascribing to them toohigh a function.THEÆTETUS: And yet your description hassome resemblance to that type (the Sophist).STRANGER: So has the dog to the wolf - thefiercest of animals to the tamest. But a cautiousman should above all be on his guard againstresemblances; they are a very slippery sort ofthing.Now let me rewrite the latter part of the dialogue.In doing so I shall move to eliminate the stranger’sinstinctive or preconceived notion of whatSophists actually are. The Sphinx gestures at thepage, and the wording changes:STRANGER: Well, what name shall we give tothe practitioners of this art?- 204 -THEÆTETUS: The characteristics you haveenumerated are those the Sophists use todescribe themselves.STRANGER: But I fear this ascribes too high afunction to them.THEÆTETUS: To say that individual Sophistsmay not achieve the standards they have set forthemselves does not disprove the nobility oftheir goal, nor their right to claim it as astandard and hence an identifying characteristicof their profession.STRANGER: I cannot find fault with that. Butlet us examine the Sophist from some othervantage-points.The wording reverts to normal, and the Sphinxcloses the book.I do not say that the dialogue should haveproceeded in a different direction. I merelydemonstrate that it would have been possible. Thisfact - that it is possible -testifies to the looseness ofPlato’s logic in this instance. Rather than refiningthe definition of the Sophist by the carefulelimination of inconsistent characteristics, Platosimply ignores implications which do not supporthis preconceived notions.The Chimæra: I’m beginning to see what you mean.The Sphinx: There are other examples which I couldtake from the text. But I think this demonstrationsufficient proof of the principle involved. Theentire dialogue is not an attempt to understandwhat a Sophist is. It is an attempt to denigrate- 205 -Sophists. As such it is of no value as an exercise inlogic or in the true process of reduction.The Chimæra: But now we are back where we started,enriched only by an irony of Socratic logic: Weknow what The Sophist is not, but we don’t knowwhat it is. So we must consider why Plato felt itnecessary to attack the Sophists at all. Why did henot feel it possible merely to coexist with them infriendly competition for men’s minds?The Sphinx: Here we must depart from the dialogue asa universe in itself. We must try to place it incontext amidst a larger and more complexuniverse. The reason for doing this is that, viewedin isolation, The Sophist is logically invalid; this wehave just proven. Seen against a largerbackground, however, it may indeed be significant.We attempt, like Archimedes, to move a world. Fora place to stand we have the existence of TheSophist; for a lever we have its bias. The worldneed move only a little, and we who push againstthe lever may count ourselves satisfied.The Chimæra: I follow you, but beware ofunsubstantiated speculation.The Sphinx: The proponent of a viewpoint who feelssecure in his position will not find it necessary toattack the mere existence of opponents. He maypoint out the fallacies in their arguments in aneffort to hasten their understanding of his “correctinterpretation”. But he will not see their“incorrect” views as a threat to the truth of hisown. An attack against the very existence ofcompetition is mounted when one is uncertain of- 206 -the invulnerability of one’s own position.Permitted to exist, competition might pose amortal challenge. Hence it must be destroyedwithout delay. Such a preemptory strike is justifiedby the rationalization that, while one has glimpsedan ultimate truth, more time is needed to refinethe ideas to a form which may be understood bythose of lesser intellectual acumen.The Chimæra: You are suggesting, then, that Plato maynot have felt secure in his philosophy - that hefeared the axioms upon which he based his logic tobe false?The Sphinx: Let us not say that he feared them to befalse. It is enough to say that he may not have beencompletely certain of their truth. Had he been, hewould have ignored the Sophists.The Chimæra: Why should Plato have attacked theSophists in particular? Was it simply because theywere his only Athenian competition? That wouldmake his motives rather materialistic.The Sphinx: Here we should bear in mind that we haveno precise catalogue of individuals whom Platoconsidered Sophists. At various times he took issuewith the ideas of Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno,and Protagoras, to name but a few theorists.Whether he considered the Sophists as comprisingonly specific individuals, or whether he consideredSophism more broadly to be composed of allchallengers to his own philosophy, is an issue wecannot decide. If we are to look through Plato’seyes via The Sophist, we can establish only that the- 207 -Sophists were guilty of teaching according tomethods too close to those of Plato himself.The Chimæra: You mean, I take it, by the process ofcross-examination described by the stranger in thepassage we considered earlier?The Sphinx: Precisely. I ask you to consider both thepraise that the stranger accords the system itselfand his unsubstantiated reluctance to credit thatsystem to the Sophists. History contains manyexamples pointing to the fact that the mostdangerous threats are those akin to the favoredphilosophy in all ways save one - which isconsidered to be crucial. Wars have been foughtsimply because men were unable to agree uponone name for the same god, or, later, because theycould not agree upon the same meanings for wordssuch as “freedom”, “democracy”, and “equality”.The Chimæra: Only two wars that I recall strike me ashaving made any sense: the Trojan War, whichwas fought for sex, and the Carthaginian Wars,which were fought for elephants.The Sphinx: Very funny. But to return to the issue athand, we have the evidence of that passage in TheSophist to substantiate this point. Plato regardedthe process of teaching through cross-examinationto be a standard of excellence in itself. Its use toteach anything other than pure philosophy,accordingly, would have been intolerable to him.Hence his extraordinary anger at the Sophists.The Chimæra: But we do know more about the Sophiststhan that. Even if we limit our scope to the school- 208 -of Protagoras, we know that Sophistic thinkingdisavowed absolute knowledge. Despairing ofattaining such knowledge, they regarded even itspursuit as worthless. So they taught a sort ofrelativistic pragmatism as the only sound basis forhuman affairs. Hence Protagoras’ famousstatement that man is the measure of all things.The Sphinx: That is right. And we know that Plato wasfirmly opposed to this view. Perhaps our mostconvincing evidence of this is the inscription abovethe entrance to his Academy: Let no oneignorant of mathematics enter here.The Chimæra: I thought it was “geometry”.The Sphinx: Unfortunately for purists it has beenrecorded both ways. But either serves to illustratethe point. Plato saw in mathematics unshakableevidence that there was an absolute standard forthe Universe. And where one such standardexisted, it was logical to assume that there wereothers. Today humans regard mathematicsprincipally as an applied science, but in Plato’stime it was considered by the Pythagoreans to be“pure”, having nothing to do with the gross andimperfect everyday world.The Chimæra: I presume that Plato would have beensomewhat upset to learn of the Theory ofRelativity, which is inconsistent with the notionthat mathematics adhere to a fixed standard. Butdo I understand you to say that Plato was aPythagorean?- 209 -The Sphinx: Not in the sense that he had anyconnections with one of the Pythagorean schoolsas such. He was born in Athens in 427 BCE, and hewas a disciple of Socrates from 409 to 399.Following Socrates’ execution in that year, Platotraveled abroad, absorbing Pythagorean doctrinesin many of the Greek cities located in Italy andAfrica. It was not until 387 that he returned toAthens to found his Academy.The Chimæra: That is interesting, but it does notconstitute evidence that Plato endorsed the viewsof the Pythagoreans.The Sphinx: No, and for that one must turn to theTimæus, wherein Plato presents his concept of theUniverse. Here he describes the five possibleregular solids - that is, those with equivalent facesand with all lines and angles equal. Four of thoserepresented the four elements, he said, while thedodecahedron represented the Universe as awhole. He also postulated that the various stellar/planetary bodies move in exact circles (the perfectcurve) along with the crystalline spheres (theperfect solid) holding them in place. All of thesetheories were originally Pythagorean, as one maysee from the writings of Philolaus and otheravowed Pythagoreans. But we wander too farafield. Let us return to Plato’s conviction that theUniverse was based upon absolute, not relativestandards.The Chimæra: I presume that the Sophists did notconsider mathematics as an invalidation of theirrelativism.- 210 -The Sphinx: Whether the issue centered aroundmathematics or not is something we cannot know.We do know that the Sophists considered whateverevidence Plato offered insufficient to dislodgethem from their position. From their point of view,the Sophists were champions of logic. They basedtheir arguments upon what they understood to be“obvious” realities. And they drew “commonsense” conclusions. What so antagonized Plato wasnot that they held different views than hisconcerning the primal forces of the Universe.Rather it was the intolerable insult - in Plato’s eyes- that they were not interested in that topic as afield for rational inquiry. Plato must have feltsomewhat akin to Noah building his Ark in themidst of an ignorant and unconcerned society.The Chimæra: The Noah legend is not in our myth-cycle, if you please.The Sphinx: My apologies.The Chimæra: And so Plato wished to identify theprimal forces of the Universe. This resulted in hisfamous Theory of the Forms, if I am correct. But Isense a weak point here. Plato was a finite being,and yet he desired to comprehend Universalabsolutes. As perfect standards they wouldnecessarily be infinite, since any measure ofperfection must extend in all dimensions withoutlimitation. It would be possible for a finite entitylike Plato to comprehend the infinite withoutdistortion only if the infinite reveals aspects ofitself to and through the finite. But the finite musthave faith or trust that the aspects are undistortedin their presentation.- 211 -The Sphinx: Precisely, and now we are getting to thecrux ansata of the matter. For, you see,assumptions based upon faith or trust are logicallyindefensible, otherwise there would be no need tobase them upon faith or trust to begin with. Plato,being a man of no mean intellect, was certainlyaware of this. He feared that an intelligent Sophistmight see it as well and proceed to attack thefoundations of his entire philosophy as illogical.And so, in the dialogues, he constructed a veryelaborate defense of his concepts according,apparently, to the most rigorous standards of thecross-examination system of the Sophists.The Chimæra: Statements like that are liable to get youinto a great deal of trouble, I hope you know.The Sphinx: Only with those who underestimate Platoand interpret this as a slur against him. Quite thecontrary, it is all the more indicative of hisbrilliance. The entire process of “logical reasoning”is ultimately circular. What humans loosely tern“cause and effect” relationships are not really thatat all. They are rather observations of phenomenabelieved to occur consistently under identicalenvironments. But logic cannot explain whyelectrons circle protons, or why the color red andthe color blue are distinct, or why the Universeexists at all. Yet every one of our senses tells usthat these things are so, and if we, as Descartes,deny the validity of our sensory input, we resignourselves to insanity. Plato’s faith derives from nogreater and no lesser observation that things arewhat they seem to be. Once that consistency isgranted, all else follows.- 212 -The Chimæra: If that is so, why should Plato have gonethrough all the trouble to create the dialogues?Merely as a blind for Sophist critics who mighthave interfered with his Academy or accused himpersonally of being irrational or illogical?The Sphinx: Again the explanation is not that simple.The dialogues may indeed have served as a blindfor the Sophists, inasmuch as they defend Platonicprinciples according, apparently, to Sophisticlogical criteria. But the dialogues would thus serveonly a negative function, and that hardly seems tojustify the obvious effort of their preparation. Platowas first and foremost a teacher, and he wouldhave designed the dialogues to teach.The Chimæra: That appears to run afoul of yourprevious statement that faith and reason aremutually exclusive. If Platonic students studied thedialogues only to become skilled at the Sophisticargumentative procedures employed therein, theywould complete the Academy only as skilledSophists.The Sphinx: We are at something of an impasse. Iconfess that I cannot resolve this evidentinconsistency. Let us seek fresh counsel.Quite suddenly there materializes a Gryphon.The Gryphon: The dilemma can be resolved, but it is soconstructed that it defies resolution by Sophisticlogic. And that is precisely the trap into which thetwo of you have fallen. Indeed the dialogues arethere to teach, but the student must put forth the- 213 -effort to see past the Sophistic teachings to thoseof Plato himself.The Chimæra: But the argumentative pattern of thedialogues is Sophistic, and any connectionbetween Sophistic logic and Platonic faith cannotexist. Do you think to pursue me?The Gryphon: The key to Plato rests in the Meno. Here- He turns to page #364:SOCRATES: Those who tell it are priests andpriestesses of the sort who make it theirbusiness to be able to account for the functionswhich they perform. Pindar speaks of it too, andmany another of the poets who are divinelyinspired. What they say is this - see whether youthink they are speaking the truth. They say thatthe soul of a man is immortal. At one time itcomes to an end - that which is called death -and at another is born again, but is never finallyexterminated. On these grounds a man mustlive all his days as righteously as possible.For those from whomPersephone receives requital for ancient doomIn the ninth year she restores againTheir souls to the Sun aboveFrom whom rise noble kingsAnd the swift in strength and greatest inwisdom,And for the rest of timeThey are called heroes and sanctified by men.Thus the soul, since it is immortal and has beenborn many times, and has seen all things bothhere and in the other world, has learnedeverything there is. So we need not be surprisedif it can recall the knowledge of virtue oranything else which, as we see, it once- 214 -possessed. All nature is akin, and the soul haslearned everything, so that when a man hasrecalled a single piece of knowledge - learned it,in ordinary language - there is no reason why heshould not find out all the rest, if he keeps astout heart and does not grow weary of thesearch, for seeking and learning are in factnothing but recollection.The Chimæra: You imply, then, that it is not the objectof the dialogues to “teach” at all -but rather toexpose Plato’s students to demanding mentalgymnastics which will inspire them to recollectknowledge of the Forms.The Gryphon: You have recollected admirably. TheGryphon dematerializes.The Sphinx: Is it not interesting that the example givenby Socrates in the Meno employs mathematics andgeometry? That ties in rather neatly with theinscription over the entrance to the Academy. Tothe Platonic philosopher, then, that inscriptionwould have meant something more than mereability to calculate areas of triangles. In effect itwould say: “Let no one ignorant of the recollectivebasis of knowledge leave here.”The Chimæra: Harking back to what you saidconcerning Plato’s exposure to Pythagoreanconcepts, it is quite appropriate. Mathematicalconsistency was Plato’s “foot in the door”, so tospeak, where the Forms were concerned. Yet, inview of relativity, does not that door slam shutupon us?- 215 -The Sphinx: That’s the Hades of it; it doesn’t. Or ratherit does, but another one opens simultaneously.The Chimæra: Do you mean that relativity providesaccess to another Form similar to mathematicalconsistency, upon which a modern Plato couldbase a Theory of the Forms?The Sphinx: No, not really. But what relativity has donehas been to turn the Meno inside-out. Look here:Socrates proves the immortality of the soul bydemonstrating its intrinsic grasp of mathematics,which he considered a Form. Pause here andconsider: What, precisely, is immortality?The Chimæra: I should say the continuous existence ofthe mind or soul.The Sphinx: That would be the case if there were nosuch thing as relativity. But there is. So let us sayrather that immortality is the ability of the mind orthe soul to exist unbounded by time, i.e. the fourthdimension. Mortality is measured according to thenotion that time is a constant. But relativitydisproves this, showing that time may be retarded,hastened, stopped altogether, or, presumably,raised to infinity. Thus the prison of a so-calledtemporal span of existence is no real prison at all.It is only imagined as such by a mind untrained infourth-dimensional movement. The mind that isimmortal is one that breaks free of time, not onethat merely plods along within it as it ticks off theæons.The Chimæra: And so the same principles of relativitythat destroy Plato’s first-known Form now open- 216 -the door to the very immortality which he soughtthrough knowledge of the Forms. Fascinating.The Sphinx: Now we must consider the implications ofthis as applied to the notion of recollection ofknowledge. When Socrates used the term in thepassage cited by the gryphon, he meant it of coursein terms of a fixed fourth dimension. He visualizedthe soul as plodding along through the æons,“seeing all things” along the way. Thus, by the timeit reached incarnation in Greece circa 400 BCE, ithad completed some 9.5 to 10.5 billion years’“ s i g h t s e e i n g ” s i n c e t h e l a s t U n i v e r s a lc o n c e n t r a t i o n o f r a d i a t i o n u n d e r w e n ttransformation into matter and antimatter,making it possible for existence to displacevacuum.The Chimæra: Just out of curiosity, how do you comeup with ten billion years?The Sphinx: Simply by dividing the distances of theknown galaxies from the calculated metagalacticcenter of this expansion cycle by their speedsaccording to the Red Shifts, then taking anaverage. But we digress again. We must still workout the nature of the acquisition of knowledge.The Chimæra: If the invalidation of time as a constanthas been shown, then the mind or soul could nothave acquired knowledge via an æonic sightseeingtrip such as Socrates describes. But the mindpossesses the capability to cast itself forward andbackward through time, since time is not fixed.- 217 -The Sphinx: Correct. The process is to imagination whatdirected thinking is to unconscious dreaming. It issomething like the Raja-Yoga technique of unitingthe mind to a single idea through force of will, orlike corresponding ceremonial magic techniques.The Chimæra: But I thought that the object of Yoga isto break the cycle of birth-death-rebirth throughunion of the soul or mind with the whole ofexistence. To one who achieves the eighth stage,samadhi, the concept of knowledge - itself arelative measurement of that which is knownversus that which is not known - would bemeaningless. All would be known, or, to use amore precise term, realized. Nothing wouldremain to be “learned”.The Sphinx: Indeed.The Chimaera: I think I am beginning to see yourpoint. There is an identity between the state ofsamadhi and the innate condition of the mind orsoul as Plato perceived it. Both exist in a state ofabsolute awareness, including, presumably, thefreedom to move through all dimensions includingthat of time. Thus they break the bonds of both afinite period and a finite path of existence,achieving true immortality. Earthly incarnationbecomes a prison in terms of both time and space,and it is the incarnated mind’s ability to travelwithin time that allows it to break free from thisprison. The ambition of Plato, like that of the Yogi,was to regain the freedom of mental movementthrough all dimensions of existence - which, ofcourse, would provide access to knowledge of theForms.- 218 -The Sphinx: That is right. And the final proof of this isthat Adepts in all cultures and all ages haveinclined towards this same realization, no matterwhat exploratory methods they may have used andwhat linguistic terminology they may haveemployed. “Proof” in the scientific sense is theachievement of identical results under identicalcircumstances by independent researchers. Ourcomparison of just two initiatory systems - that ofPlato and that of Yoga - meets these criteriaexactly, given that the “identical circumstance” inthis case is Earthly incarnation.The Chimæra: Similar evidence could be obtained fromadditional case studies of other initiatory systems.But one substantiation suffices for our discussion.The Sphinx: And now, I think, we are finally in aposition to understand Plato’s distinction of thework of a true philosopher from that of a sophist.Let us return to The Sophist. He turns to page#998:STRANGER: Well, now that we have agreedthat the kinds stand toward one another in thesame way as regards blending, is not somescience needed as a guide on the voyage ofdiscourse, if one is to succeed in pointing outwhich kinds are consonant, and which areincompatible with one another - also, whetherthere are certain kinds that pervade them alland connect them so that they can blend, andagain, where there are divisions [separations],whether there are certain others that traversewholes and are responsible for the division? ...And the man who can do that discerns clearlyone form everywhere extended throughoutmany, where each one lies apart, and many- 219 -forms, different from one another, embracedfrom without by one form, and again one formconnected in a unity through many wholes, andmany forms, entirely marked off apart. Thatmeans knowing how to distinguish, kind bykind, in what ways the several kinds can orcannot combine.The Chimæra: I am well satisfied. Now that we haveresolved the questions raised by The Sophist, itseems necessary to consider The Statesman aswell.The Sphinx: We know that The Statesman was writtenas a sequel to The Sophist - that Plato intended hisideal statesman to be antithetical to the “worstpossible kind” of Sophist. Observe: He turns topage #1074.STRANGER: Therefore all who take part in oneof these governments - apart from the one basedupon real knowledge - are to be distinguishedfrom the true statesman. They are notstatesmen; they are party leaders, leaders ofbogus governments and themselves as bogus astheir systems. The supreme imitators andtricksters, they are of all Sophists thearchSophists.YOUNG SOCRATES: It seems to me that thewheel has come full circle, now that the title ofSophist goes to those who most deserve it, to themen who get themselves called political leaders.The Chimæra: That may be nothing more than anotherof Plato’s invectives against the Sophists in general- a bit of name-calling without real substance.Such seems to be the opinion of academic critics,who are prone to ignore this exchange. But let us- 220 -reexamine Plato’s alienation from the Sophists. AsI said earlier:Even if we limit our scope to the school ofProtagoras, we know that Sophistic thinkingdisavowed absolute knowledge. Despairing ofattaining such knowledge, they regarded evenits pursuit as worthless. So they taught a sort ofrelativistic pragmatism as the only sound basisfor human affairs. Hence Protagoras’ famousstatement that man is the measure of all things.The Sphinx: We then considered the Pythagoreanprecedents for Plato’s conviction that the Universeadheres to absolute and not relative standards. Buthow does this tie in with The Statesman?The Chimæra: The connection seems to be that Platoconsiders statesmanship also to be absolute andnot relative. Observe the following key passage: Heturns to pages #1051-2.STRANGER: Must we not do now what we hadto do when discussing the Sophist? We had toinsist then on the admission of an additionalpostulate, that “what is ‘not x’ neverthelessexists”. We had to introduce this postulatebecause the only alternative to asserting itwhich our argument left us was to allow theSophist to escape definition altogether. In ourpresent discussion too there is an additionalpostulate on which we must insist, and it is this:“Excess and deficiency are measurable not onlyin relative terms but also in respect ofattainment of a norm or due measure.” For if wecannot first gain assent to this postulate, we arebound to fail if we advance the claim that a manpossesses statecraft, or indeed that a manpossesses any other of the special forms ofknowledge that function in human society.- 221 -YOUNG SOCRATES: In that case we mustcertainly follow the precedent and admit theadditional postulate in our present discussiontoo.STRANGER: Our present task is greater thanour previous one, Socrates, and we can hardlyhave forgotten what a very long time that tookus. However, while discussing these problems,there is one thing to be said at the outset that itis perfectly right and proper to say here.YOUNG SOCRATES: What is this?STRANGER: That when one day we come togive a full exposition of true accuracy indialectic method, we shall find the need of thispostulate concerning the due measure which wehave just enunciated. However, the statement inthe form we have made it and with thedemonstration - adequate for present purposes -which we have given of it, is a very great help tous, or so it seems to me. For it shows that twopropositions stand or fall together. The first isthat the arts exist; the second is that excess anddeficiency are measurable not only relatively butin terms of the realization of a norm or duemeasure. Thus if measure in this second senseexists, so do the arts, and, conversely, if thereare arts, then there is this second kind ofmeasurement. To deny either is to deny both.The Sphinx: That “existence of ‘not x’ postulate”, as Irecall, left something to be desired in terms oflogical integrity. The point hinged upon things thatwere not themselves “existence” being able toexist. In distinguishing them from “existence”,Plato treats “existence” as an entity. But, whensaying that certain things “exist”, he treats “exist”as a quality. That is inconsistent and henceinconclusive. He glances at page #1003- 222 -indignantly, then turns to pages #1050-1. Andwhat sort of demonstration of this secondpostulate does he offer?STRANGER: On the other hand, will we not alsobe ready to assert that we do in fact hear wordsspoken and see acts done which at one timeexceed the essentially right measure and atanother time fall short of it? Is it not just thismatter of attaining the due measure whichmarks off good men from bad in human society?The Chimæra: That’s not much of a proof. The words oractions that impress one observer as ideal maystrike another as excessive or inadequate.Similarly “good” and “bad” are subjective terms.Plato is guilty of a non sequitur.The Sphinx: True. If the stranger had been talking withsomeone like Protagoras instead of the docileyoung Socrates, The Statesman would havefloundered [and foundered] right there.The Chimæra: Note that, immediately after makingthat statement, Plato tries to reinforce it bydenying that statecraft - or any other art - can existwithout it. Thus he assumes that statecraft hasalready been proved to be an absolute standard,when in fact it has not. Two unproved statementscannot be used to prove each other, and so Plato isguilty of a second logical fallacy, generally knownas interdependence.The Sphinx: Since the rest of The Statesman hingesupon young Socrates’ blind disregard of these twofallacies, is there a point in our discussing itfurther? What we have uncovered here is not some- 223 -relatively-unimportant digression. The subsequentstructure of The Statesman is one of peeling awayinadequate manifestations of statesmanship,leaving, theoretically, the Form itself at the core. Ifthere is not an agreed-upon Form, then thepeeling-away process is pointless.The Chimæra: To be fair to Plato, let us examine hisidea of the Form of statesmanship. He turns topage #1077.STRANGER: If you will view the three arts wehave spoken of as a group with a commoncharacter, you will be bound to see that none ofthem has turned out to be itself the art ofstatesmanship. This is because it is not theprovince of the real kingly art to act for itself,but rather to control the work of the arts whichinstruct us in the methods of action. The kinglyart controls them according to its power toperceive the right occasions for undertaking andsetting in motion the great enterprises of state.The other arts must do what they are told to doby the kingly art ... It is a universal art, and sowe call it by a name of universal scope. Thatname is one which I believe to belong to this artand this alone, the name of “statesmanship”.The Sphinx: On the whole, that’s not a bad definition.And, I might add, there is nothing in it whichnecessitates the existence of an absolute standardfor statesmanship. A statesman can simply be aperson who is relatively skilled at emphasizing,directing, and applying the various arts andsciences of a state or community.The Chimæra: So it would seem. In view of Plato’sattack on “arch-Sophists” as being the leaders of- 224 -all but the perfect [Form] government, one mightsuspect that he insisted upon an absolute standardof government just so that he could attributeeverything less than that to Sophistry. Havingdelivered such an uncomplimentary blow to bothSophists and politicians, Plato could quietlyabandon the notion of an absolute governmentalstandard. In fact, the definition that I just quotedis thoroughly relativistic and cannot be applied interms of absolute standards.The Sphinx: And just how do you draw that conclusion?The Chimæra: If each subordinate art in a communitypossesses its own standard of absolute perfection,a raising or lowering of the application of that artby the statesman would cause excess or deficiencyin the art itself. For example, the military artinvolves winning battles and wars. If thestatesman, for the good of the entire community,prevents the military from conducting battles orwars, the military art itself experiences adeficiency. At a later date, if the military does go towar, that deficiency will be evident as inexperiencein combat. Similarly, if the statesman orders themilitary to fight too many battles or wars, excesswill occur. The military will become inefficientthrough demoralization and attrition. To permitthe military to function at an ideal level, astatesman would have to allow a level ofcontinuous or intermittent warfare. This,obviously, would not be ideal for the state as awhole.- 225 -The Sphinx: Your point being that the ideal level of asubordinate art as a thing in itself is at odds withits ideal application by the statesman’s art.The Chimæra: Yes, and there’s more to it than that. Ifthere is an ideal standard or level for bothcomponent arts and the statesman’s art, then themaintenance of that standard or level over aperiod of time should ensure continuous and idealprosperity for the state as a whole, correct?The Sphinx: Theoretically, yes.The Chimæra: But conditions outside that state willvary. A neighboring state may go to war against it,for example.The Sphinx: That would necessitate an alteration ofcertain component arts - such as materielproduction, resource allocation, and militaryactivity - by the statesman, if he is to perform hisideal role.The Chimæra: But this means exceeding or fallingbelow the ideal standards of the individualcomponent arts. In other words, the idealstandards of a component art by itself and theideal level of that art as a factor in the overallcommunity do not coincide. Therefore, if Platoinsists upon absolute standards, he places hisstatesman in the position of having tocontinuously violate the absolute standards ofcomponent arts for the sake of his own art.The Sphinx: I suppose Plato would argue that the idealstandards of the component arts would include- 226 -consideration for the proper level of those artswithin the community as a whole.The Chimæra: That still begs the question. The postureof the community must change as its externalenvironment changes. Therefore the componentarts will be subject to continuous revision of theirlevels of activity and emphasis. They becomefactors relative to the community, just as thecommunity becomes a factor relative to itsexternal environment. Q.E.D.The Sphinx: So Plato’s definition of statesmanship isvalid only if both that art and the subordinate artsare assumed to be variable and relativistic. Howintriguingly Sophistic!The Chimæra: ... All of which brings us back to thebasic “relativity vs. absolutism” issue between[what Plato would call] Sophistry and Philosophyrespectively. In a purely practical sense we cannotcontinue to use those terms as Plato did, because“ s o p h i s t r y ” n o w c o n v e y s t h e i m a g e o fcharlatanism, while “philosophy” embracesrelativistic as well as absolutist theories.The Sphinx: True. The basic issue still remains, but theold labels are no longer accurate. Why do yousuppose Plato felt so strongly that absolutestandards (Forms) existed?The Chimæra: It probably started with what hebelieved to be common sense. Our senses seem totell us that the world around us is made up ofreliable and permanent phenomena. A chair canbe counted upon to remain a chair, a desk a desk.- 227 -The Sun and the planets behave regularly.Relativism carried to its logical conclusion woulddeny these things. How could the Sophists say that“man is the measure of all things” as they walkedabout on the solid and permanent ground ofGreece? Man cannot decide that the ground will bethere one minute and transmute into water thenext. Plato must have felt that he was arguing acase for the way things actually are, even if heencountered difficulties in justifying that positionlogically.The Sphinx: To be quite precise, a chair does notremain a chair nor a desk a desk. Both areundergoing continuous molecular breakdown,which is not apparent to humans because theynormally experience sensory input at a relativelyswifter rate. Nor are astronomical bodies trulyconstant; they only seem that way, again becauseof the relative differences in their rates of changeand in human perceptive powers. At the other endof the scale, there are phenomena that occur tooswiftly for human senses to register them. So theyseem “instantaneous”. So how dependable isPlato’s “actual world”?The Chimæra: I am tempted to say that, relativelyspeaking [from the human point of view], theworld appears to adhere to absolute laws.The Sphinx: Now that is an interesting statement! Youmean that the human ability to perceive relativechange exists in a comparatively small range, andthat phenomena changing at rates beneath orabove that range appear to be instantaneous orpermanent, as the case may be.- 228 -The Chimæra: I suppose so.The Sphinx: Can we not identify anything that is trulypermanent? That is in fact absolute and notrelative?The Chimæra: That was Einstein’s problem. He wasable to postulate only one thing that was absolute -the speed of light. But in that he was wrong.The Sphinx: Wrong? Kindly explain!The Chimæra: We run the risk of straying rather farfrom The Statesman.The Sphinx: But not from our ultimate topic.Remember that we are trying to get a grip on trueconceptual analysis, and to do that we had betterresolve this relative/absolute issue once and forall. According to the Platonic school of thought,political science has an absolute standard, just asphysical laws do. That is the argument of TheStatesman. So now we have said that Einsteinreduced physics to only one absolute - the speed oflight - and you dispute even that. I for oneconsider a resolution of this germane. If youdestroy absolutism in the physical world, then thebasis for attempting to parallel the “absolutephysical world” with an “absolute political world”disappears altogether. So proceed.The Chimæra: All right. According to Einstein’s secondfundamental postulate of the Special Theory ofRelativity, the velocity of light is always constantrelative to an observer, no matter how fast theobserver and the light source may be separating or- 229 -converging. A derived equation states that, whenan object is moving with respect to an observer,the mass of the object becomes greater, theamount of increase depending upon the relativevelocity of object and observer. As the mass of theobject increases, its length along the axis of itsdirection will decrease. At the speed of light, theobject’s mass becomes infinite, and its lengthshrinks to zero. Since an infinite-plus amount ofenergy would be required to raise the speed of aninfinite mass beyond the speed of light, suchhyper-light speed is not possible.The Sphinx: So states the Special Theory.The Chimæra: Now, internally the Special Theory isconsistent, because it treats the speed of light as aconstant and incorporates a series of equationswhich rely upon that constant and are consistentwith one another. As the Special Theory applies tophenomena which are substantially below thespeed of light, it is practical. The interrelationshipof mass and energy relative to 186,000 miles persecond (the Einstein speed of light constant) hasbeen formulated as E=mc2 and put into practicethrough nuclear fission.The Sphinx: Where, then, lies the fault?The Chimæra: The Achilles’ Heel of the Special Theoryis that, while applying the principle of relativity toeverything else except the speed of light, it therebytreats the speed of light as an exception to therule. An exception to a rule of physics is anindication that the rule is inadequate to cover allknown phenomena. Einstein’s decision to treat the- 230 -speed of light as a constant was based upon thedifference between the speed of light and non-light-wave-related phenomena being so vast as tomake sub-186,000 mps light speed impossible todetect; and also upon the inability of science todetect anything traveling faster than 186,000mps.The Sphinx: Why this emphasis upon the word“detect”?The Chimæra: Detection and existence are twodifferent things, and that difference is crucial tomy argument. Now consider this hypothesis: Iflight waves from a stationary source travel at186,000 mps, and those light waves are the onlymeans an observer located elsewhere has fordetection of that source, what would happen if thesource were to begin moving away from theobserver at 186,001 mps? Those light waves thatare the sole source of the observer’s informationwould no longer reach that observer. The wavesare now receding from him at 1 mps. As far as theobserver can detect, the light-source vanishedwhen its speed exceeded the speed of light. But didthe source in fact cease to exist? It did not. [And itspresence may be detectable by observing warps inradiation waves and emissions affected by it - apossible explanation of the “black hole”phenomenon.]The Sphinx: What about light-sources that areproceeding in directions other than diametricallyaway from an observer?- 231 -The Chimæra: As for an object approaching anobserver at 186,000+ mps, it would arrive before itcould be detected at any distance as a movingobject, because humans do not possessinstruments that can identify approaching lightspeeds in excess of 186,000 mps - which would bethe only means of identifying the object’sapproach. If the source were to proceed at atangent to an observer, it will seem to compress asit approaches the speed of light. The explanationfor this illusion is more complex, but I mayapproximate it by saying that the lateralmovement/oscillation of the emitted light waves isless detectable as the lateral speed of the objectapproaches 186,000 mps. At 186,000 mps thewaves are no longer detectable as waves - merelyas radiation; hence the illusion that the source hastransmutated from matter to energy.The Sphinx: In fact, then, the Special Theory containsits own invalidation. It states that everything isrelative, but it cannot exist as a formula without atleast one absolute constant - which, uponexamination, proves to be relative itself. Whichleaves only one question: If it is wrong, why doesE=mc2 work?The Chimæra: Because the values which are pluggedinto that formula are so far below 186,000 mpsthat the speed of light might as well be treated as aconstant. For equations that include values closerto 186,000 mps, the formula becomes increasinglyless accurate. Hence the preposterous calculationthat a mass at 186,000 mps becomes infinite. Thatis simply the result of the formula’s intrinsicdistortion.- 232 -The Sphinx: This is all very unsettling. So everything isrelative?The Chimæra: Let’s not jump to conclusions.Remember what we decided concerning Plato’sown proof of absolute Forms?The Sphinx: Yes. I referred to the Platonic Academy’sinscription Let no one ignorant of mathematicsenter here, and then I said:Plato saw in mathematics unshakable evidencethat there was an absolute standard for theUniverse. And where one such standard existed,it was logical to assume that there were others.Today humans regard mathematics principallyas an applied science, but in Plato’s time it wasconsidered by the Pythagoreans to be “pure”,having nothing to do with the gross andimperfect everyday world.The Chimæra: Would you care to elaborate upon that?The Sphinx: The best thing to do is to quote directlyfrom Thomas Stanley’s 1687 account of thePythagorean doctrines, which draws its materialfrom Porphyrus, Iamblicus, Strabo, etc. TheStanley text materializes, and the Sphinx turns toPart IX page #522. Consider the following: [sic]The mind being purify’d [by Discipline] ought tobe applied to things that are beneficial; these heprocured by some contrived ways, bringing it bydegrees to the contemplation of eternalincorporeal things, which are ever in the samestate; beginning orderly from the most minute,lest by the suddenness of the change it shouldbe diverted, and withdrew itself through itsgreat and long pravity of nutriment.- 233 -To this end, he first used the MathematicalSciences, and those Speculations which arei n t e r m e d i a t e b e t w i x t C o r p o r e a l s a n dIncorporeals, (for they have a ThreefoldDimension, like Bodies, but they are impassiblelike Incorporeals) as Degrees of Preparation tothe Contemplation of the things that are;diverting, by an artificial Reason, the Eyes of theMind from corporeal things (which never arepermanent in the same manner and estate)never so little to a desire of aliment; by meanswhereof, introducing the contemplation ofthings that are, he rendered men truly happy.This use he made of the Mathematical Sciences.These Sciences were first termed μάθημα byPythagoras upon consideration that all Mathesis(discipline) is Reminiscence, which comes notextrinsecally to souls as the phantasies whichare formed by sensible objects in the Phantasie;nor are they an advantageous adscititiousknowledg, like that which is placed in Opinion;but it is excited from Phænomena’s, andperfected intrinsecally by the cogitationconverted into it self.The Chimæra: How very interesting. It would seem thatthe recollective basis of knowledge, heretoforeassumed to be a Platonic concept, is in factPythagorean.The Sphinx: And the use of mathematics as a key to thisparticular sort of knowledge, i.e. of the Forms.The Chimæra: Who is this Stanley, and how reliablecan he be considered to be?The Sphinx: Thomas Stanley graduated fromCambridge at age 16 as a Master of Arts. Hepracticed law; was fluent in French, Italian,- 234 -Spanish, and the Classical languages; and issuedthe first volume of his famous History ofPhilosophy when he was only 30. The threeparagraphs cited above are all footnoted to originalGreek sources.The Chimæra: So Plato used mathematics as a “place tostand”, in an effort to make the Universeintelligible by reason alone. And Platonists tend toemphasize this, shielding Plato from the despisedtitle of “mystic”. See here: He indicates page #xvin the Collected Dialogues .[Huntington Cairns:] But the differencebetween Plato and the mysticism that hasattached itself to his philosophy is essential.Plato’s aim is to take the reader by steps, with assevere a logic as the conversational methodpermits, to an insight into the ultimate necessityof Reason. And he never hesitates to submit hisown ideas to the harshest critical scrutiny; hecarried this procedure so far in the Parmenidesthat some commentators have held that his owndoubts in this dialogue prevail over hisaffirmations. But the beliefs of mystics are notproducts of critical examination and logicalclarification; they are, on the contrary, a seriesof apprehensions, flashes, based on feeling,denying the rational order. The mystic’s reportsof his experiences are beyond discussioninasmuch as they are subjective and emotional;they must be accepted, by one who wishes tobelieve them, as a matter of faith, notknowledge. Plato’s view of the world is that ofan intelligible system that man can know bydisciplined intellect alone. He was, in fact, thefounder of logic, a logician and a poet, but hewas not a mystic, he never exalted feeling abovereason.- 235 -The Sphinx: Well, well. What do you think Cairns wouldsay to the following quote from The Statesman?He turns to page #1082.STRANGER: When there arises in the soul ofmen a right opinion concerning what is good,just, and profitable, and what is the opposite ofthese - an opinion based on absolute truth andsettled as an unshakable conviction - I declarethat such a conviction is a manifestation of thedivine occurring in a race which is in truth ofsupernatural lineage.YOUNG SOCRATES: It could not be moresuitably described.The Chimæra: (dryly) He would probably say that,since sphinxes and chimæras do not really exist,nothing we say is to be taken seriously.The Sphinx: So, where Plato is concerned, a great dealhinges upon the basis for mathematics itself. Is itacquired through reason or through mysticalvision, so to speak?The Chimæra: This is rather curious. Plato actually setshis dialectic process in contrast to mathematics,almost as though the object of the Dialogues is toarrive at a Form greater than that of mathematics.He turns to page #746.I understand, he said, not fully, for it is no slighttask that you appear to have in mind, but I dounderstand that you mean to distinguish theaspect of reality and the intelligible, which iscontemplated by the power of dialectic, assomething truer and more exact than the objectof the so-called arts and sciences whoseassumptions are arbitrary starting points. And- 236 -though it is true that those who contemplatethem are compelled to use their understandingand not their senses, yet because they do not goback to the beginning in the study of them butstart from assumptions you do not think theypossess true intelligence about them althoughthe things themselves are intelligibles whenapprehended in conjunction with a firstprinciple. And I think you call the mental habitof geometers and their like mind orunderstanding and not reason because your e g a r d u n d e r s t a n d i n g a s s o m e t h i n gintermediate between opinion and reason.The Sphinx: It’s all very well for Plato to say that, andI’m sure that dialecticians are not displeased toconsider themselves more intellectual thanmathematicians. Yet we have found, in both TheSophist and The Statesman, that Plato cannotproceed with his arguments unless he assumes thedivinely-inspired ability to perceive not onlygreater, but absolute perfection when he isconfronted with it. That is not reason; it isrevelation. Plato does mathematics an injustice:While mathematicians openly admit that theirconclusions are originally based upon assumptions(axioms), Plato pretends that his are not. And ofcourse they are. Just as Einstein required aconcrete assumption - a constant speed of light -upon which to build his mathematical philosophy,so Plato must have an assumption - the ability torecognize absolute perfection - upon which tobuild his dialectic philosophy.The Chimæra: Plato seems to be caught in a trapbetween the relativistic Sophists on one hand -who denied the reliability of intuitive assumptions- and the Pythagoreans on the other - who- 237 -permitted original assumptions via revelation/intuition. Plato rejects the notion that axioms arenecessary for reason, yet he cannot reason withoutthem. No wonder he was so touchy about theSophists.The Sphinx: Note the very precise manner in which thePythagoreans discussed the original assumptionsof mathematics: Again he indicates page #522 ofthe Stanley text.The whole science of Mathematicks, thePythagoreans divided into four parts,attributing one to Multitude, another toMagnitude; and subdividing each of these intotwo. For Multitude either subsists by it self, or isconsider’d with respect to another; Magnitudeeither stands still, or is moved. Arithmetickcontemplates Multitude in it self: Musick withrespect to another: Geometry, unmoveablemagnitude; Sphaerick, moveable.These Sciences consider not Multitude andMagnitude simply, but in each of these thatwhich is determinate: for Sciences consider thisabstracted from infinite, that they may not (invain) attempt in each of these that which isinfinite. When therefore the wise persons saythus, we conceive it is not to be understood ofthat multitude which is in the sensible thingsthemselves, nor of that magnitude which weperceive in bodies, for the contemplation ofthese I think pertains to Physick, not toMathematick. But because the Maker of allthings took Union and Division, and Identity,and Alterity, and Station and Motion tocompleat the soul, and framed it of these kinds,as Timæus teacheth, we must conceive that theIntellect, consisting according to the diversitythereof, and the division of proportions and- 238 -multitude, and knowing it self to be both oneand many, proposeth numbers to it self, andproduceth them and the Arithmetical knowledgof them. According to the union of multitudeand communication with it self, and colligation,it acquireth to it self Musick: for which reasonArithmetick excels Musick in antiquity, the soulit self being first divided by the Maker, thencollected by proportions. And again establishingthe operation within it self, according to itsstation, it produceth Geometry out of it self, andone figure, and the principles of all figures, butaccording to its motion, Sphaerick: for she ismoved by circles, but consists always in thesame manner according to the causes of thosecircles, the straight and the circular: and for thisreason likewise Geometry is precedent toSphaerick, as Station is to Motion.But forasmuch as the Soul produced theseSciences, not looking on the excitation of Ideas,which is of infinite power, but upon theboundure of that which is limited in theirseveral kinds, therefore they say that they takeinfinite from multitude and magnitude, and areconversant only about finite: for the mind hathplaced in her self all principles both ofmultitude and magnitude, because being whollyof like parts within her self, and being one andindivisible, and again divisible, and producingthe world of Ideas, it doth participate essentialfiniteness and infiniteness from the thingswhich it doth understand: But it understandsaccording to that which is finite in them, andnot according to the infiniteness of its life. Thisis the opinion of the Pythagoreans, and theirdivision of the four Sciences. Hitherto Proclus.The Chimæra: In the final analysis, whether Cairnswould enjoy the idea or not, Plato must be classedwith the Pythagoreans as a “mystic”, in that he- 239 -assumed that humans possess a supernaturalpower beyond reason to recognize perfection/absolute Forms.The Sphinx: Yes. The Sophists were the only ones whocould claim to be “non-mystics”, because theywould not admit to revealed accuracy of any sort.Plato tried to strike a balance between the Sophistsand the Pythagoreans, but there is just no halfwayposition that holds water. The Pythagoreans wouldhave been amused by Plato’s laboriousargumentative process, holding it to be a waste oftime, in that the final answer to a given problemcould be known only by revelation/recollection. Asfor the Sophists, they would have faulted Plato’sarguments by denying the primary assumptions/revelations in them.The Chimæra: All of which leaves us where?The Sphinx: Well, I think we have pretty well finishedwith The Statesman. But our discussionconcerning the Pythagorean aspects of “Plato’s”philosophy raises yet another question: To whatextent was Plato an original thinker?The Chimæra: On that thorny little problem I will letyou take the lead.The Sphinx: I think we would be wise to start with someobservations about time - not just the way mosthumans regard it, but the way Plato himselfperceived it. I recall a pertinent comment of G.J.Whitrow’s in his book The Nature of Time:- 240 -The first question to consider is the origin of theidea that time is a kind of linear progressionmeasured by the clock and the calendar. Inmodern civilization this conception of time sodominates our lives that it seems to be aninescapable necessity of thought. But this is farfrom true ... Most civilizations, prior to our ownof the last two or three hundred years, havetended to regard time as essentially cyclic innature. In the light of history, our conception oftime is as exceptional as our rejection of magic.The Chimæra: Well said. Modern academicians areconditioned to an essentially Newtonian attitudetowards time. They regard it as a simpleprogression of events. The past may be referred to,and visions of the future may be projected, butneither past nor future has any intrinsic effectupon the present - nor do they exist objectively atall.The Sphinx: In a cyclical system of time, by contrast,past, present, and future would all be part of asingle continuum. This wouldn’t necessarily meanthat “history repeats itself” either. Rather thecomponents of fourth-dimensional existencewould continue to exist, although they might beundergoing periodic rearrangement andrecomposition. One might draw an analogy to theinterchangeability of matter and energy; a"},{"pageContent":"seemingly-endless variety of transmutation takesplace, but the “sum of the whole” remains thesame.The Chimæra: Take the Platonic notion of thetransmigration of souls. It wouldn’t make muchsense if entirely new souls could come into being“out of nothing”, would it? Yet the transmigration- 241 -theory has been ridiculed on the grounds that (a)world population is expanding, and (b) pastincarnations have not been recalled to standards ofscientific proof. If “the stuff of which souls aremade” can transmutate from other components ofa unified time-continuum, then the first objectiondisappears. And limited recomposition [short oftransmutation] would account for the second.The Sphinx: And this would put the concept of therecollective basis of knowledge in a new light aswell. Instead of knowledge being cumulative orprogressive [again a purely-linear concept] withthe linear “passage” of time, it can be considered“circular” - rearrangements and recombinations ofcertain all-inclusive principles which are part ofthe cyclical continuum, i.e. “timeless”.The Chimæra: A provocative way of approaching theTheory of the Forms.The Sphinx: Let us try to “clear the air” of modempresuppositions and place ourselves in the time-environment that Plato himself perceived. As helooked at the world around him and observedchanges taking place, wouldn’t linear time haveseemed obvious to him? Within the scope of hisown consciousness, for example, he could tell thatthings “weren’t the way they used to be” and thatnew events were regularly taking place.The Chimæra: On a small scale, yes. But, seen at the“Forms level”, various events could be viewed asmodifications of a single Form of political behavioror as more complex combinations involving morethan one Form. Thus the conquest of Athens by- 242 -Sparta or the conquest of Sparta by Athens wereessentially variations on the same Form [ofconquest], distinguished by variable applicationsof other Forms [such as economic pressures,military power, political imperialism, etc.]. Viewedin this context, events could indeed be consideredcyclical.The Sphinx: Well, have we justification to presume thatPlato truly thought in that context? After all, it is aperspective so broad that it could have beenattacked as useless for concrete applications. Inpoint of fact this was the basic Sophist criticism ofPlato - that his philosophy, while it might be trueon a macrocosmic scale - was of no help to peoplewho were trying to solve immediate problems. Sothe Sophists advocated problem-solvingtechniques that ignored macrocosmic Forms.The Chimæra: In the Republic, Laws, arid Statesmanwe have three attempts by Plato to make hispolitical philosophy relevant. But it would be amistake to say that he merely attempted to “scaledown” this Form or that Form to a problem-solving level, in order to compete with theSophists. A Form is not that sort of “thing”; it isnot an axiom which can be applied to variousproblems. Rather it is a sort of sum-total ofidentifying characteristics in various phenomenawhich relate them, as sphinxes and chimæras arevariations of the Form “mythical beast”.The Sphinx: Speak for yourself. But we have nowreached a point where we can explore thedevelopment of Forms-theory prior to Plato’stime ... excuse me, Plato’s point of focus in the- 243 -continuum. Because the Forms - and especially theones that were applicable to statesmanship -weren’t all that nebulous. In fact they were theguiding principles of the most ancient civilizationin the Mediterranean -and the one with the mosthighly-developed political system as well. I amtalking, of course, about Egypt.The Chimæra: The most highly-developed politicalsystem? You’re going to get some objections onthat score. The accepted impression of Egypt isthat it was a simple military monarchy, reinforcedby a death-obsessed religion, which cared nothingfor philosophy. I quote Bertrand Russell:P h i l o s o p h y b e g i n s w i t h T h a l e s , w h o ,fortunately, can be dated by the fact that hepredicted an eclipse which, according to theastronomers, occurred in the year 585 B.C.Philosophy and science - which were notoriginally separate - were therefore borntogether at the beginning of the sixth century. 115The Sphinx: Bertrand Russell was ever quaint. “Sixthcentury” my claw! For thirty recorded centuriesbefore Thales, Egypt had existed as a nationalsystem - not a mere city-state or even federation ofcity-states. It was older to the Greeks than theGreeks are to present-day humans. Scientifically itd e v e l o p e d a r c h i t e c t u r e t o a p r e c i s i o nunapproached again until the present century [andin some aspects still unequaled]. 116 It developed115 Russell, Bertrand, A History of Western Philosophy, page 3.116 Stecchini, Livio, “Notes on the Relation of Ancient Measures to theGreat Pyramid” in Tompkins, Peter, Secrets of the Great Pyramid,pages 287-382.- 244 -elaborate, codified medical skills [including that ofopen-skull brain surgery] which were used with ahigh measure of success. 117 It possessed the onlyaccurate calendar in the entire Mediterraneanuntil the time of Julius Cæsar [when Cæsarintroduced a modified Egyptian calendar to theRoman Empire]; the Egyptians’ own records dateback to 4241 BCE! 118 And what of the hieroglyphicalphabet, introduced more than seven thousandyears ago? 119The Chimæra: I expect that part of the problem lies inthe fact that the alphabet you just mentioned wasso very hard to read. Indeed it was almost a sort ofcipher used exclusively among the Egyptianintelligentsia. Training of a scribe took abouttwelve years, and even then a scribe was not in aposition to understand the significance of most ofthe philosophical material he was recording. ByPlato’s time other, less complex linguistic systemshad come into use for both reading and writing,and probably no one in Athens could readhieroglyphic, let alone gain access to philosophicaltexts hoarded by the Egyptian priesthoods. So it isnot so very surprising that Egyptian philosophywas not discussed by the Greeks, except fortourist-type accounts such as that of Herodotusand the Egyptian passage of Plato’s own Timæus.The Sphinx: The last known use of hieroglyphic writingeven in Egypt itself was in 394 CE [on the Temple117 Cottrell, Leonard, Life Under the Pharaohs, pages 189-191.118 Casson, Lionel, Ancient Egypt, page 146.119 Ibid., page 141.- 245 -of Isis at Philæ]. 120 Thereafter all knowledge of thelanguage vanished from human knowledge untilChampollion decoded the Rosetta Stone in 1822CE. And only a small number of Egyptian textshave been translated today -by a smaller handfulof people who can read the language. So perhapsRussell’s statement can be partially excused, if notcondoned.The Chimæra: Then, too, Egypt has suffered a savagepillaging over the centuries. As a symbol of“heathen paganism” it was viciously despoiled bythe early Christians and their Moslem successors.C o u n t l e s s a n c i e n t t e m p l e s w e r e e i t h e rappropriated or razed by the Catholics, andthousands of statues and inscriptions weredisfigured. In 389 CE a Christian mob, acting onthe orders of the Christian Roman EmperorTheodosius, burned the great library of Alexandriato the ground. 121 Even so, millions of book-rollswere rescued or gathered together from otherrepositories and the library was reestablished -until 636. In that year Alexandria was taken byOmar, the Third Caliph of Islam, who decreed:“The contents of these books are in conformitywith the Koran or they are not. If they are, theKoran is sufficient without them; if not, they arepernicious. Therefore let them be destroyed.” Theywere burned as fuel to heat the city’s baths; it tooksix months for all of them to be consumed. 122 So itis not too surprising that modern researchers have120 Ibid.121 Tompkins, op. cit., pages 3-4.122 Berlitz, Charles, Mysteries from Forgotten Worlds, page 36.- 246 -only a pitiful few scraps of information frompreviously-undiscovered tombs or overlookedmonuments.The Sphinx: Before we explore the links between theEgyptians and Plato, it may help if we bring outsome of the salient characteristics of the Egyptianpolitical system. To begin with, it was cyclic ratherthan linear. Individual pharaohs and dynastiescame and went, but the social system and politicalstructure remained constant. Each successivepharaoh, for example, was merely the momentarypersonification of a permanent, semi-divine entitythat governed Egypt in the name of the gods. Thenation itself was not viewed as merely one in aseries of political units located in northeast Africa;it had existed as a divine creation before recordedhistory, and it would continue to exist indefinitely.Various natural cycles and human lifetimes wouldimpact upon it, but the essence of Egypt wouldremain untouched by [linear] time. 123 Consider,for example, the following hieroglyphic inscriptionaccompanying an image of the scarab-beetleXepera, principle of cyclical regeneration andimmortality:I was the spirit in the Primeval Waters. He whohad no companion when his name Came IntoBeing. The most ancient form in which I CameInto Being was as a drowned one. I was he whoCame Into Being as a circle. He who was theDweller in his Egg. I was the one who beganeverything, the Dweller in the Primeval Waters.First the Wind emerged for me, and then Ibegan to move. I created my limbs in my glory. I123 Compare this to the Chinese view of China as the “MiddleKingdom” ( Chhung kuo), the “focus” of civilization and creativity.- 247 -was the maker of myself; I formed myselfaccording to my desire and in accord with myheart. 124The Chimæra: If each pharaoh were held to be divinely-appointed, what was the actual selectionprocedure? And how could a human-supervisedselection procedure retain credibility as a divineprocess?The Sphinx: It compares rather intriguingly with thesystem for selection of philosopher-kings in theRepublic. During stable dynasties new pharaohswere selected from among the male offspring ofthe late pharaoh. There was more latitude in thisprocess than one might think, because (a)pharaohs generally had many wives andconcubines, resulting in scores of children, and (b)the education and selection of pharaohs werehandled by colleges of priests, themselvesdetached from the secular government butexercising a sort of guardianship over it.Unsuitable princes were either diverted toharmless careers or simply assassinated. With theexception of a few temporary puppet-kings orusurpers, then, Egyptian monarchs were generallypriest-kings [an intentional reference to theAtlantean tern in the Critias] of exceptionalcalibre. Incumbent pharaohs who began to behavein maverick fashion [such as Akhenaten, themonotheist mystic of the XVIII Dynasty] were alsoassassinated with the tacit consent of thepriesthood. This method of “impeachment” doesnot seem to have been abused, because an attackon the divine pharaoh for purely-partisan motives124 Clark, R.T., Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt, page 74.- 248 -would have been thought extremely ill-omened.Only for an obvious betrayal of the pharaoh’ssacred trust - as determined by the priesthood -could assassination be contemplated.The Chimæra: What sort of legal system did theEgyptians have?The Sphinx: Now we enter some particularly interestingterritory from a Platonic standpoint. As far as canbe deduced from surviving records, bureaucraticand judicial affairs were not conducted accordingto a centralized legal code superior to thejudgment of individual officials. Such officialswere given a more-or-less free hand within theirrespective areas of responsibility - contingent, ofcourse, upon the maintenance of order, paymentof taxes, and general preservation of a harmoniousattitude among the people. There were nolegislated standards of good and evil/right andwrong. Justice was meted out ad hoc according toeach supervisory official’s concept of fairness andequity. The Egyptians prized this system veryhighly; it was personified by the goddess Maat.When an Egyptian died, a feather from Maat’scrown would be weighed against his heart todetermine whether he would be granted a pleasantrepose in Amenti or be torn limb from limb bymonsters from the Tuat. I expect that would-becrooks were inhibited accordingly, since theEgyptian religion was taken quite literally.Consider the following inscription, dating fromone of the earliest Old Kingdom dynasties of Egypt[and compare it to the concept of Tao]:- 249 -If you are a leader who directs the affairs of amultitude, strive after every excellence untilthere be no fault in your nature. Maat is good,and its worth is lasting. It has not beendisturbed since the day of its creator, whereashe who transgresses its ordinances is punished.It lies as a path even in front of him who knowsnothing. Wrongdoing has never yet brought itsventure to port. It is true that evil may gainwealth, but the strength of truth is that it lasts; aman can say, “It was the property of myfather.” 125The Chimæra: A rather interesting contrast to thegovernments of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Greece,all of which laid stress upon codified law. I expectyou are leading up to a comparison to the Republicand Statesman, wherein Plato argues for specially-trained or specially-gifted rulers above the law. Areyou going to suggest that Plato took the Egyptiansystem as an ideal governmental model?The Sphinx: Let’s not jump the spear on this. I have afew other points to make concerning the Egyptiansystem proper; then we’ll look into the matter ofits actual links with Plato. Again bearing therecommendations of the Republic in mind,consider the following: Almost uniquely within theancient world, Egypt was free from hereditarycaste, racial, or sexual discrimination in politicalaffairs. A social aristocracy was created byproperty-inheritance, but a scion of poor or evenunknown parentage might just as easily rise tohigh office upon demonstrating suitable prowess.At various times the throne was held by Negroes,Persians, Mesopotamians, Greeks, and assorted125 Frankfort, Henri, Ancient Egyptian Religion, page 62.- 250 -Asians without racial objections being raised.Women enjoyed the same “citizenship” status asmen, including choice of mate and inheritance ofproperty. Queens such as Nefertiti and Ty wieldedas much or more power than their consorts, andfemale pharaohs such as Hatshepsut andCleopatra ruled Egypt as decisively and with asmuch popular sport as did male pharaohs. Even inthe Egyptian religious pantheon, gods andgoddesses enjoyed equal prestige.The Chimæra: To an observer this extraordinaryflexibility and tolerance might well account for thestaying-power of the Egyptian system, in spite ofthe occasional invasions, occupations, and evencivil wars that took place there. When the dustcleared, so to speak, the political and socialinstitutions remained intact.The Sphinx: Precisely. Egypt was no more a utopia thanany other human-run society was, is, or will be.There were power-struggles, epidemics ofcorruption, popular revolts, and all the rest.During the Middle Kingdom (2150-1792 BCE) apessimistic Pharaoh Amenemhet I advised CrownPrince Senwosret:Harken to that which I say to you,That you may be king of the earth,That you may be ruler of the lands,That you may increase good.Harden yourself against all subordinates.The people give heed to him who terrorizesthem;Approach them not alone.Fill not your heart with a brother,Know not a friend,Nor make for yourself intimates,- 251 -Wherein there is no end.When you sleep, guard for yourself your ownheart;For a man has no people in the day of evil.I gave to the beggar, I nourished the orphan;I admitted the insignificant, as well as him whowas of great account.But he who ate my food made insurrection;He to whom I gave my hand aroused fear in myheart. 126The Chimæra: But the institutions survived, and on thewhole Egyptians were able to boast of a far morestable, prosperous, and inspiring society thanthose of the other Mediterranean countries. That isyour point?The Sphinx: Yes. By contrast the Greece of Plato’s timewas in pretty sorry shape. The various city-statescouldn’t even maintain stable governments of theirown, much less get along with each other. Elitistsystems such as that of Sparta were vulnerable totyranny by strongmen; democratic Athens sufferedfrom demagoguery and dictatorships. The much-vaunted philosophers were tolerated only as longas they were not thought to be actual threats.When they were inconvenient, as Plato andAristotle had occasion to observe, hemlock orbanishment awaited. Great principles of religionand/or philosophy were ridiculed in favor ofSophistic opportunism. Yet -and I think this is animportant point - the Greeks had demonstratedthat they were quite capable of high intellectualachievement. They had produced a number ofnoteworthy philosophers, artists, statesmen,126 Fairservis, Walter A., The Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile, pages98-99.- 252 -architects, and military leaders. What they hadnot produced was a stable cultural environment inwhich such talent could be nurtured. In hispolitically-oriented dialogues, therefore, Platosought a system of government that could achievethis stability without being as dictatorial as, say,the Persian or Assyrian monarchies. In Egypt, if infact he realized it, he had a near-exact functioningmodel of his Republic - and one which wasworking quite well.The Chimæra: ... If he realized it! So the problem isnow to discover what connections, if any, Platohad with Egypt. Are the Dialogues of any help?The Sphinx: No, they aren’t. There are a very fewpassing references to Egypt, but nothing of anysubstance. It would be discouraging if it were notfor the fact that the Pythagoreans are similarlyignored. That makes the situation a bit suspect. IfPlato’s links with Egypt are tenuous, his links withthe Pythagoreans are beyond doubt. The geometricpassages in the Timæus are virtually purePythagorean doctrine. And, from a political pointof view, the Pythagoreans represented the extremeof initiated elitism that Plato juxtaposed toSophistry. To the Sophists, human values werepurely relative to custom, convention, andpractical necessity; to the Pythagoreans, valueswere eternal, unchanging, and universal - the“Platonic” Forms. How is it that the Pythagoreanscame to hold this point of view? Let us look toPythagoras himself for the answer.The Chimæra: Back to the Stanley text. I see that mostof its biographical entries concerning Pythagoras- 253 -are footnoted to Iamblicus, a fourth-century CENeoplatonist, and from Diogenes Laertius, writingabout a century earlier. Specific passages dealingwith Pythagoras’ stay in Egypt are footnoted toPorphyrus and Clemens Alexandrinus as well. InChapter III “How he travelled to Phœnicia” weread:He made a voyage to Sidon, as well out of anatural desire to the place itself, esteeming it hiscountry, as conceiving that he might more easilypass from thence into Egypt.Here he conferred with the Prophets, successorsof Mocus the Physiologist, and with others, andwith the Phoenician Priests, and was initiatedinto all the mysteries of Byblus, and Tyre, andsundry of the principal sacred institutions indivers other parts of Syria, not undergoing thesethings out of Superstition, as may be imagined;but out of love to knowledg, and a fear, lest anything worthy to be known, which was preservedamongst them, in the miracles or mysteries ofthe gods, might escape him. Withal, not beingignorant, that the rites of those places werededuced from the Egyptian ceremonies, bymeans whereof he hoped to participate of themore sublime and divine mysteries in Egypt,which he pursued with admiration, as hisMaster Thales had advised him. 127The Sphinx: Two rather intriguing points - first thatMesopotamian initiatory priesthoods were thoughtto be corruptions or derivations of their Egyptiancounterparts, and secondly that Pythagorasundertook this quest on the advice of Thales.Thales was reputed to have been born of a127 Stanley, Thomas, The History of Philosophy, page 494.- 254 -Phœnician mother, and it is more-or-less reliablyestablished that he studied the science of geometryin Egypt. 128 But please continue.The Chimæra: Here are some extracts from Chapter IV“How he travell’d to Egypt”:Antiphon, in his Book concerning such as wereeminent for virtue, extolleth his perceverancewhen he was in Egypt, saying, Pythagorasdesigning to become acquainted with theinstitution of the Egyptian Priests, anddiligently endeavoring to participate thereof,desired Polycrates the Tyrant to write to AmasisKing of Egypt, with whom he had friendship (asappears also by Herodotus) and hospitality,(formerly) that he might be admitted to theaforesaid Doctrine. Coming to Amasis, Amasisgave him Letters to the Priests, and going firstto those of Heliopolis, they sent him to thePriest of Memphis, as the more ancient, whichwas indeed but a pretence of the Heliopolitans:[For the Egyptians imparted not their mysteriesto every one, nor committed the knowledg ofDivine things to profane persons, but to thoseonly who were to inherit the Kingdom; and, ofPriests, to those who were adjudged to excel therest in education, learning, and descent.] FromMemphis, upon the same pretence, he was sentto Thebes. They not daring, for fear of the King,to pretend excuses; but thinking, that by reasonof the greatness and difficulty thereof, he woulddesist from the design, enjoyned him very hardprecepts, wholly different from the institution ofthe Grecians, which he readily performed, totheir so great admiration, that they gave himpower to sacrifice to the gods, and to acquainthimself with all their studies, which was never128 Asimov, Isaac, Asimov’s Biographical Encyclopædia of Scienceand Technology, page 2.- 255 -known to have been granted to any forraignerbesides. Clemens Alexandrinus relatesparticularly, that he was disciple to Sonchedes,an Egyptian Arch-prophet. 129The Sphinx: Again something catches my eye - thatcomment about Egyptian initiation normally beingreserved for the pharaoh and the priesthood alone.In the Statesman Plato writes:For the priest and the diviner have great socialstanding and a keen sense of their ownimportance. They win veneration and respectbecause of the high tasks they undertake. This isshown in the fact that in Egypt none can be kingunless he belongs to the priestly caste, and if aman of some other caste succeeds in forcing hisway to the throne, he must then be made apriest by special ordination. 130The Chimæra: Now how would Plato come to know thatbit of information, unless he were party to policieswithin the Egyptian priesthoods?The Sphinx: It is always possible that he heard it fromthe Pythagoreans, although it seems onlyincidental to the sort of doctrines thatPythagoreans would be inclined to discuss. So herewe may have a link directly between Plato and theEgyptian initiatory orders. Continue with thematerial from Stanley.129 Stanley, op. cit. , page 94.130 Plato, Collected Dialogues, page 1059.- 256 -The Chimæra:Diogenes saith, that whilst he lived with thesePriests, he was instructed in the Learning andLanguage (as Antiphon also affirms) of theEgyptians, and in their three kinds of writing,Epistolick, Hieroglyphick, and Symbolick;whereof one imitates the common way ofspeaking; the rest allegorical, by Ænigms. Theywho are taught by the Egyptians, learn first themethod of all the Egyptian Letters, which iscalled Epistilographick; the second, Hieratick,used by those who write of sacred things; thelast and most perfect Hieroglyphick, whereofone is Curiologick, the other, Symbolick. Of theSymbolick, one is properly spoken by imitation,another is written as it were Tropically; anotheron the contrary doth allegorize by Ænigms. Forinstance, in the Kyriologick way, to express theSun, they make a Circle; the Moon a Crescent.Tropically they do properly traduce, andtransfer, and express by exchanging somethings, and variously transfiguring others. Thuswhen they deliver the praises of Kings, inTheological Fables, they write by Anaglyphicks.Of the third kind, by Ænigms, let this be anexample: All other Stars, by reason of theiroblique course, they likened to the bodies ofserpents, but the Sun to that of a Beetle, becausehaving formed a ball of Cow-dung, and lyingupon its back, it rolls it about (from claw toclaw.)131The Sphinx: Once again there is more here than meetsthe eye. It is possible that lamblicus or one of theother sources could have made up the other detailsof a trip by Pythagoras to Egypt, but here we seemto have conclusive proof - both of the trip itself and131 Stanley, op. cit., pages 494-495.- 257 -of Pythagoras’ initiation. For the description givenof the Egyptian linguistic system is in completeagreement with what has come to light with thediscoveries of Champollion and Young. 132 Stanleycould not have known this, and it is highlyimprobable that Iamblicus or any of the otherbiographers could have known it either.Hieroglyphic writing was a closely-guarded skill inEgypt, and, as we noted earlier, its teachingrequired many years of study. Pythagoras’initiation seems all the more probable.The Chimæra: Here is the concluding passage from thechapter:Thus being acquainted with the learning of thatNation, and enquiring into the Commentaries ofthe priests of former times, he knew theobservations of innumerable Ages, as ValeriusMaximus saith. And living admir’d and belov’dof all the priests and prophets with whom heconversed, he informed himself by their meansaccurately, concerning every thing; not omittingany person, eminent at that time for learning, orany kind of religious rites; nor leaving any placeunseen, by going into which he conceived, thathe might find something extraordinary. [For hewent into the Adyta of the Egyptians, (and, asClemens saith, permitted himself to that end tobe circumcised) and learned things not to becommunicated concerning the gods, mystickPhilosophy.] He travelled to all the Priests, andwas instructed by every one, in that whereinthey were particularly learned. In Egypt he livedtwenty two years, in their private sacred places,studying Astronomy and Geometry, and wasinitiated (not cursorily or casually) into all the132 Budge, Sir E.A. Wallis, Egyptian Language, pages 13-42.- 258 -religious mysteries of the gods. Lærtius saith,He made three Cups of silver, and presentedthem to each [Society] of the Egyptian Priests;which, as we said, were three, of Heliopolis,Memphis, and Thebes. 133The Sphinx: It is perhaps worthy of note that thesources cited by Stanley lived at points of timewhen the bulk of the material from the library atAlexandria still existed. It is not unreasonable toassume that they would have either taken orverified their accounts from such records as theycould read [in Greek if not in hieroglyphic] fromthat institution. At the time its prominence wasunparalleled by any other literary repository in theMediterranean, and it is hard to imagine scholars -particularly ones dealing with such a subject asthis - bypassing it.The Chimæra: The highly-selective “clubs” or schoolswhich Pythagoras established in Sicily andsouthern Italy seem to align more closely to thefashion of the Egyptian priesthoods than toschools of the Greek tradition. Stanley, quotinglamblicus, makes this point and hints thatPythagoras’ exacting methods were not well-received:His country summoned him to some publickemployment, that he might benefit thegenerality, and communicate his knowledge:which he not refusing, endeavored to instructthem in the symbolical way of learning,altogether resembling that of the Egyptians, inwhich he himself had been instituted. But the133 Stanley, op. cit. , page 495.- 259 -Samians not affecting this way, did not applythemselves to him. 134The Sphinx: I think we have satisfactorily establishedthe links between Pythagoras and the Egyptianpriesthoods. Now we must determine to whatextent the Egyptian doctrines reached Plato, eitherdirectly or through the Pythagoreans.The Chimæra: Stanley quotes the following passagefrom Porphyrus:Moderatus saith, That this (PythagorickPhilosophy) came at last to be extinguished,first, because it was aenigmatical; next, becausetheir Writings were in the Dorick Dialect, whichis obscure, by which means, the Doctrinesdelivered in it were not understood, beingspurious and misapprehended, because(moreover) they who publish’d them were notPythagoreans. Besides, Plato, Aristotle,Speusippus, Aristoxenus, and Xenocrates, as thePythagoreans affirm, vented the best of them, astheir own, changing only some few things inthem; but the more vulgar and trivial, andwhatsoever was afterwards invented by enviousand calumnious persons, to cast a contemptupon the Pythagorean School, they collectedand delivered as proper to that sect. 135The Sphinx: That certainly doesn’t appear to be toocomplimentary to Plato. Yet the fact remains thatthe cosmological philosophy in the Timæus isindisputably Pythagorean, yet is nowhere creditedby Plato to the Pythagoreans or to Pythagoras134 Ibid., page 496.135 Ibid., page 508.- 260 -himself. What of the Pythagoreans’ politicaldoctrines?The Chimæra: In The Genesis of Plato’s Thought, AlbanD. Winspear summarizes them succinctly, if lessexhaustively than Stanley:It is true that Pythagoras himself seems to haveheld no elective office in any Greek state. Hisfunction was rather to organize political clubswhich busied themselves with practical politicalaffairs and developed a general intellectualapologia for aristocratic rule.[Quoting Iamblicus] The Pythagoreans met incaucuses and gave counsel about politicalaffairs. With the passage of time, it came aboutthat the young men not only took the lead indomestic matters but in public too; they came togovern the city, forming a great political club.For they were more than three hundred innumber.It is in this connection not without significancethat Pythagoras himself held (according to oneauthority) [Stobæus] that all income shouldcome from agriculture. Here we have a hint ofthat same prejudice against the merchants andthe democracy, that defense of the position ofthe landed proprietor which so constantlyrecurs in Greek idealistic thinkers.Once this point is understood, the philosophicalteachings of the Pythagoreans becomeintelligible. A passage in lamblicus (which goesback to Aristoxenus) gives their point of viewvery clearly, and we must connect it with ourprevious discussion about the importance of theproblem of justice:- 261 -Pythagoras thought that the most efficaciousdevice for the establishment of justice was therule of the gods, and beginning with that heestablished the state and the laws, justice andthe just.In this interesting passage we have a long stepforward in the theologizing of the concept ofjustice. The contemplation of divine things,thought the Pythagoreans, instructed byPythagoras himself, was useful for mankind.The reason was that we need a master, someruling principle against which we do not dare torise in rebellion, and this is provided by thedivinity. Our animal nature, he argued, issubject to hybris and is diverse and chaotic,subject to control by a variety of impulses,desires, and passions. There must be a powerwhich by its superiority and its “threateningeminence ( epanastasis)” will introduceprudence and order into chaos. 136The Sphinx: Compare this notion of justice as a divinestandard to the Egyptian concept of Maat whichwe discussed earlier. Here we find evidence of aForm discussed virtually identically by first theEgyptians, then Pythagoras, then Plato. It issomething higher than law, higher than humanreason or learned wisdom - it is a “god” itself.The Chimæra: The actual characteristics of what aregenerally known as the “Egyptian gods” are farcloser to the notion of Forms than they are to thelater pantheons of pagan cultures such as Greece,Rome, and Scandinavia. A reading of Egyptiantexts translated directly from the hieroglyphic willsubstantiate this. In only a very few legends [such136 Winspear, Alban D., The Genesis of Plato’s Thought, pages 81-82.- 262 -as that of the death and rebirth of Osiris] do thegods assume human behavioral characteristics. Inthe vast bulk of the existing texts they are far moreabstract, having “personalities” that seem tooverlap one another and symbolic attributes thatare difficult to identify in terms of purely-humandesires. Consider the following inscription fromthe tomb of Rameses VI in this light, noticing theoverlap between Truth ( Maat) and Ra:Adoration to Truth. Salutation to thee, this Eyeof Ra through which he lives every day! Theywho are behind the chapel fear her, the BrilliantOne, She who comes out from the head of himwho made her. On the Head Serpent, whocomes out in front of him! Thou art the brillianteye who leads him, the word of judgment of theOne Whose Name Is Hidden, the victorious onebefore the Ennead, Lady of Fear, great ofrespect, Truth, through whom Ra is glorified,she who appeases for him the Two Lands by herdecrees, she who speaks to the gods and chasesaway evil, whose abomination is sin, she whoappeases the hearts of the gods! Thou art thebalance of the Lord of the Two Banks, whoseface is beautiful when Ra comes to his Truth,being glorious through her. Those in Busirispraise him through her, litanies are sung to himby the great gods while she adores the powers ofthe Two Chapels. He is glorious through her,more than the gods, in this her name of theBrilliant One. Thoth brought her and reckonedher, the Established One, the Brilliant, theReckoned One, in this her name of the IpetSerpent. He made her live as a Uræus in this hername of Opener of the Ways, She who leads himon the ways of the horizon, in this her name of- 263 -Leader of Men. He erected her on his head inthis her name of Very Great Crown. 137The Sphinx: A passage such as this is quite impossibleto explain in terms of ordinary human conventionsand values. It certainly bears scant resemblance tothe light, allegorical adventures of laterMediterranean gods and goddesses. Yet to oneversed in the language of the Egyptianpriesthoods, its meanings are quite clear. If Platowere an Egyptian initiate, one can see why hewould dismiss conventional means of reductionistlogic as a means for comprehending the Forms.The Chimæra: We have seen definite evidence ofPythagorean doctrine in the Platonic writings, andat the beginning of this discussion we recountedPlato’s visit to the Pythagorean centers in Italy andAfrica from 399 to 387 BCE. But are there anygrounds to suppose that Plato received directinitiation at the hands of an Egyptian priesthood?The Sphinx: There are at least two indications that hedid. First there is the following passage from thePrefaces of St. Jerome [circa 340-420 CE], placedby order of Popes Sixtus V [1585-1590] andClement VIII [1592-1605] as introduction to theBible:Pythagoras and Plato, those masters of thegenius of Greece, visited as pilgrims seekingafter knowledge and as humble disciples thesacerdotal college of the soothsayers atMemphis [ Memphiticos vates], preferring to beinitiated with respect to the ancient doctrines of137 Piankoff, Alexandre (Ed.), The Tomb of Ramesses VI, page 321.- 264 -that distant land, rather than impose on theircountry the yoke of their own ideas. 138The Chimæra: At the risk of belaboring the point, Iagain note that this passage was written prior tothe final destruction of the Alexandrian library and[possibly] such references to the matter as it mayhave contained for scholars of the time.The Sphinx: For that matter, there may have been othersources available to St. Jerome which, for onereason or another, have not survived to the presentday. Our second bit of evidence comes fromProclus, who states that Plato was initiated inEgypt over a thirteen-year period by the priestsPatheneitb, Ochoaps, Sechtnouphis, and Etymonof Sebennithis. 139The Chimæra: Again we can indulge in a littledetective-work. The names of the first three priestscan be rendered precisely in hieroglyphics; thatargues for their authenticity. [The fourth can berendered only approximately and thus is notconclusive.] The “thirteen-year period” happens tocoincide with the normal training time for anEgyptian scribe [to achieve full fluency in thehieroglyphic language]. As for Sebennithis, it wasthe seat of the Egyptian government from 378 to360 BCE under Nekht-Hor-heb I, first pharaoh of138 “Taceo de philosophis, astronomis, astrologis, quorum scientiamortalibus utilissima est, et in tres partes scinditur. to dogmathnmeqodon, thn empeirian. Ad minores artes veniam,” etc. [A.Hyeronomi, Prologus galateatus, in Bibl. saer.].139 Proclus, quoted in Christian, Paul, Histoire de la Magie, duMonde Surnaturel et de la Fatalité à travers les Temps et lesPeuples, page 88.- 265 -the XXX Dynasty. Hence it would have been bothrelatively secure from a political standpoint and alogical place for Plato to seek Egyptianinitiation. 140The Sphinx: Talk about last-minute timing! In 340BCE, after more than four thousand years of nativenational rule, Egypt finally fell to a Persian army[which in turn fell to Alexander the Great in 332].How sophisticated the Egyptian initiatory systemsremained under purely-occupational governmentsis open to question - as would be the willingness ofEgyptian priests to initiate foreigners under suchcircumstances. Even Pythagoras’ initiation manyyears earlier seems to have occurred only aftersome arm-twisting by Amasis, himself a nativeEgyptian pharaoh and thus an initiate in his ownright. A Persian or a Ptolemaic ruler would nothave had such leverage over the nativepriesthoods, nor the knowledge to judge whetherforced-instruction were in fact genuine. AfterPythagoras and Plato the link with the Egyptianpriesthoods was broken. [This may very wellaccount for the sharp distinctions between thePythagorean/Platonic doctrines - with theirapparent sophistication and seeming uniqueness -and the decidedly-diluted commentaries (such asthose of Aristotle) which trailed along after them.]The Chimæra: Having come this far, what may weconclude concerning Plato’s legacy?140 Brugsch-Bey, Heinrich, Egypt Under the Pharaohs, pages450-451.- 266 -The Sphinx: He left two memorials: his writings and hisAcademy. The former contain discussions ofForms [or Egyptian “gods”, if you will!] on aninitiatory level, although they are also useful asexercises in ordinary logic. The latter was, ineffect, a Pythagorean school minus the strictpersonal and psychological discipline thatPythagoras thought important [and whichcontributed directly to the burning of Crotona andthe slaying of Pythagoras himself - by outraged ex-students who had failed to withstand thepressure]. Evidently Plato thought that he couldtransmit the doctrines in an environment moresuited to Greece than to Egypt. And he wassuccessful, at least to the extent that the Academyenjoyed a long and productive existence - and tothe extent that his own writings were preserved forour consideration at this point in the time-continuum. He may have failed to provide theGreece of his own day with the sort of enlightenedgovernment that he might have preferred, but hehad seen Pythagorean domination of Sicily andItaly come to grief. So perhaps he was not soanxious as some might suppose to duplicate thePythagorean experiment in Greece itself. WhereasPythagoras died a violent death and left none ofhis personal works for posterity, Plato lived a fulllife and left a rich heritage for scholars - andInitiates - of the future. That, certainly, istestimony to his wisdom.The Chimæra: “The secret worship of the logos in thecosmos, the divine spark in every human form.” 141141 Incantation, Raghavan Iyer to M.A. Aquino, 1975.[index-267_1.png]- 267 -BibliographyAlvarez, A., The Savage God: A Study of Suicide.
