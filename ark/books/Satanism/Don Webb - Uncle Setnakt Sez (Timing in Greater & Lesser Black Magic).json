[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Timing in Greater and Lesser Black Magic Don Webb Uncle Setnakt would like to share a few tips about timing in Lesser and Greater Black Magic. 1. When you need to establish yourself as a control figure, arrive early. It may seem boorish, but if you help the host do the set up, you can greet each newcomer with phrases like, \"we have decided to\" or \"We were just talking about\" -- this set you up as being a member of the Inner Circle and also lets you set the agenda for the evening. 2. When you need to discover the true leaders of a group, arrive late. Simply ask a few people what you've missed. If anything has been said rather than their simple human venting of hot air, they'll point it out not only with their words but with their to ne and body language. This will also let you know what their feelings are about the current string of topics. People find it very hard to be neutral when someone whispers to them and acts sheepish about being late. This mode of interaction automatically puts them into conspiratorial mode. Be sure to reward your best sources by telling them how perceptive they are. Some people's self importance comes entirely from their ability to pass on secrets. Use them. 3. When you have an agenda to pass on to your business, pick a time when your co-workers are sleepy. When I want to get something started at work -- rather than brainstorm on a topic, I schedule my meetings after lunch, in a slightly too warm conference room (if it has flickering fluorescent lighting this is a plus). People are full and sleepy. They want the meeting to be over, and if I talk smoothly, distinctly, and in three quarters time they absorb my suggestions as though I've hypnotized them. Which in fact I have. If you need to judge three quarters time, practice doing Dracula's lines from Lugosi movie -- but lose the accent. 4. If you want to gain more Self knowledge, occasionally radically alter you biological rhythms. Sleep, food and sex are the keys here. Take a nap in the afternoon (if you already don't) and be sure and record the strange dreams that come in your dream diary. Fast until you feel deliciously faint, and see how your consciousness both is and is not a product of your body. Have sex much more in a single session than you do normally and study the powerful lucidity that exhaustion brings. Abstain from sex until you become a walking flame of desire. These exercises will tell you more about yourself than any number of Cabala textbooks. An important thing here -- while recording these exercises in your magical diary, do not tell anyone else about them (they may notice the behaviour -- particularly the sex), but keep them quiet. You will also begin to see the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"arbitrary nature of the world and this experiential insight will strengthen your Greater Black Magic and your Becoming. 5. If you want to train will, test your concentration against the clock. Like the athlete trains his body, the magician must train his psyche. Many beginners find that they cannot concentrate for more than seconds at a time. They perceive this as a failure rather than the natural outcome of societal training (docile sheeple aren't supposed to concentrate). A simple and powerful exercise is to put aside nine minutes a day to meditate on projecting your godhood from the realm of Being into the realm of Becoming. During this active meditation hold a long leather thong with a few beads on it. Every time you find that your concentration has wandered, move a bead from one end to the other. Don't nag yourself, just return to the process. At the end of the exercise note in your magical diary how many beads you've had to move. In a short time you'll find that you're moving fewer and fewer beads. 6. If you want to master your mind, make clocks work for you. Most of the time our consciousness is purely reactive. We see something and think about it in the shallowest way possible. The Black Magician needs to train his mind to move him toward alertness and control. Paradoxically the use of an arbitrary symbol to remind us to awaken is one of the best ways to move toward an alert state. Just as we use an alarm lock to end physical sleep, we can use a regular clock to move us toward consciousness. Pick a time that you will think about a certain topic, such as, \" Tomorrow at three o'clock I will inventory my life to see how well I am using Indulgence as a watchword in my life.\" Learning how to program your thought paths in advance is excellent magical training. It makes you the master of your subjective universe as well as making you constantly aware of your efforts in the objective universe. This exercise will change you from an animal reactive state into a godlike controlling state – as well as reminding you of yo ur inner-directed priorities so you can change your actions in order to be more in line with what is truly important. As with all training, be gentle with yourself -- persist but don't castigate yourself at early failures. You've got a lifetime of sleepwalking to overcome. 7. If you want to gain mastery over the world, affirm your good timing. Affirmations are the simplest way to make an operant change in your consciousness. By telling yourSelf that something is good, pleasurable, etc. your magical self will begin to alter itself and the world to bring about this good thing. So the next time you arrive at a shop exactly the right moment, or run into a friend on the street, or any piece of really good timing comes your way – tell yourself, \"I the Great God N. have given myself this pleasant gift through my mastery of time.\" Eventually the missed moment, the awkward scramble to get somewhere, becomes a thing of the past. 8. If you want to make lasting change in the minds of men, learn to observe the times. Study the lives of Satanic masters like Zaharoff, Rasputin, Cagliostro,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rosenburg, von List, the brothers Grimm. How was the perfect historical timing the key to the changes that each of these flock have Worked upon human consciousness? Contrast them with other figures in history that had the right idea, but expressed it at the wrong time. Learn to be patient and vigilant -- coiled like a snake ready to spring. Saying something too early just to prove you're clever may give you an instant gratification, but preparing your ground is the key to a good harvest. This tip is as true for influencing one individual as it is for the mass of humanity as a whole. 9. If you wish to have fulfilment in both this life and beyond, make a life plan. There is a secret teaching among the Gurdjieffians that different types of Work must be done at different times. This reflects changes in the body and the changes wrought by the growing articulation of the psyche as a separate entity from the natural order (initiation). Although you should change your life plan as your vision changes, you should begin to study the lives of geniuses to see what sort of Work the different ages of a man are best suited for. When did the great writers write their great books, when did great religious leaders do their work, when did politicians do their best statecraft? Couple this study with the study of role models and you will learn when it is easier to effect certain changes in your self and the world. Also if you can find a group of likeminded individuals -- you can observe how the processes of maturation and individuation effects their magical/philosophical progress and skills. Lives of increased excellence and power are not accidents. Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
