It was just thatkind of place:This is also that kind of book: nostalgia,eccentricity, ghosts, mind-cobwebs. It may interest,perhaps amuse you simply as casual conversationover after-dinner coffee. During the last couple ofyears I’ve been on a binge of serious, scholarly books- even stories reflecting my Lovecrafty penchant forentangling unbelievable fact with believable fiction.Admirers & alarmists alike have occasionallywondered whether, darkly concealed behind myprofessional & academic persona of exemplarystability and rationality, there lurks a Phibesian- 13 -psychotic indulging, nay driven by depraveddementia. Wonder no longer: I’m a lifelong car nut.It all began over fifty years ago in 1964. After anunremarkable Eisenhower-childhood in which carswere mere transportation utilities, I had just beenelected National Secretary of the Eagle Scout HonorSociety, the Knights of Dunamis. There was aNational Board meeting in San Mateo, California,and the new National Commander, Robert S. Ballou,picked me up at the airport - in a small whitePontiac with the three letters G T O on its grille &flanks.“What’s a GTO?” I asked Bob as we cruisedslowly onto the Highway 101 onramp. “This,” hesaid, and stomped the gas pedal to the floor.Two things immediately happened: Under thehood three double-barreled carburetors all openedat once, and my skeleton made a determined effortto push its way out the back of my body.“Oooh, goodness gracious!” 1 I said when theairblast slowed enough for me to breathe some of it.The rest, as they say, is history: this history.In his The Compleat Witch, Anton SzandorLaVey observed that a man’s personality is revealedby what’s in his garage. That may no longer bedefinitive for the “Internet & anti-fossil fuel” kids,but he arguably had a point with regard to his own,Great Depression-era and my own postwar“Boomers” generations. Anton’s collection includeda rare 1937 “coffin-nose” Cord, a Cadillac hearse, ablack Buick Limited limousine, a skyblue Jaguar 4.2litre sedan, and the ultimate “penis car”: anOldsmobile Toronado. Whenever he visited me in1 O.K., so that’s not exactly what I said, but this book is ratedPG-13.[index-14_1.jpg]- 14 -St. Louis and Santa Barbara, he enjoyed taking mylatest toys for a high-velocity spin.But this book is not merely an old attic toybox.Each acquisition responded to a situation and/orstate of mind, either personal or “out there” in theWorld of Horrors. Each car provided power,protection, or some subconscious magical key. Somefactors I recognized at the time; others may lurch tothe surface for the first time in these pages.The reader will doubtless notice that these carsare not only unusual and exotic, but also sticker-shocking. Nevertheless one of my habits was tosearch for and find the “exceptional” opportunity,even if it meant waiting a year or longer for avehicle. Hence there is no methodical order to thesequence herein, and in several cases just a quickreaction to a surprise opportunity. Overall I neithermade nor lost significant amounts of money; butthen again these were never “ulterior investments”.Finally, as will also become evident herein in duecourse, this is a “closed history”. The deteriorationof my bodily health, and particularly my eyesight,has brought the gavel down. This does not give mecause for despondence. Had I denied or delayedthese fantasies and adventures until it was too late,it would be a different story. Happily that was neverthe case. So hang on tight - here we go![index-15_1.jpg]- 15 -Introduction: “High Octane”- by Don WebbAdventurers along the Left-Hand Path have areputation for unexpected contrariness. We’reobserved concentrating on one thing, only to veer offelsewherish for maddeningly-obscure reasons.When invited to Introduce Baron2 Dr. 3 Col. 4 Michael Aquino, arguably thegreatest Black Magician of hisgeneration and reciprocal Teacher of my Teacher, Idecided to write about my uncle instead, then aboutthe Runes for awhile. Then, if I have space left,perhaps a word or two about Aquino.My uncle Oliver Scot was a distinguishedemployee of the Southwestern Public ServiceCompany in Amarillo, Texas. He was a World War IIveteran who saw action in the Pacific Theater. Whenhe left home for the War, he had black hair; when hereturned, it had turned white.We kids were told not to ask about the War, sowe didn’t.2 Yes, he is the 13th Baron of Rachane, as recognized by HMThe Queen’s representative in Scotland, the Lord Lyon King ofArms, Court of the Lord Lyon, Edinburgh.3 Yes, he received the Ph.D. in Political Science from theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara in 1980.4 Yes, he is a Lt. Colonel, U.S. Army (Ret.) in Special Forces,Political-Military Affairs, Human & Space Intelligence, etc.[index-16_1.jpg][index-16_2.jpg]- 16 -Here’s what I discovered Uncle Oliver could do:anyeverything. He could build a wall, install a toilet,wire an entire house. One of my earliest memories -I was only 3 - was of his constructing an entirestorage room in our attic for my mother.He had one great love: fishing. Over the decadeshe determinedly saved, always taking advantage ofovertime, towards his dream of creating a fishingcamp. Shortly before he retired in 1981, he boughttwo lakefront parcels in the town of Lake Palestine.There he proceeded to build a beautiful house with abold, strong dock from which to fish. The entireestate was magnificent.The week before the party he’d been planning tounveil his masterpiece to family and friends, he keptthe doctor’s appointment he’d been procrastinating -and learned that his body was riddled with stage-4cancer - which had not yet become painful, but soonwould. His remaining days were consumed asthough on fire, finally releasing him in 1983. But hehad lived in his earthly paradise for two preciousmonths; he had heroically not wasted one minute.[index-17_1.png][index-17_2.jpg]- 17 -Curiously during the chemotherapy ordeal, hishair had turned brown and curly, as though toemphasize his Protestant work-ethic.Today I know of no one who works harder thanMichel Aquino, though I don’t think he’s aProtestant. He has consistently, quietly generated astream of thoughtful works on a variety of subjectswhile simultaneously juggling the demands ofacademia, the military, and an ancient/futureinitiatory religious institution.Somewhere amidst all this, he inspired me toread Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. Blackmagic-contrarily he also introduced me to Forrest J5Ackerman: the legendary “Mr. Science Fiction” whogave us “sci-fi”, “egoboo”, and 10 puns per day tomake us laugh - though as I recall, no pun in ten did.Nevertheless our workaholic Baron alsocherished love - indeed two of them. This book isabout one of these and Dedicated to the other: the5 No period! Ever! Unless you want to be consumed horriblyby shoggoths lingering beneath the Ackermansion at 3495Glendower in Hollywood for just such blasphemous outrages.[index-18_1.jpg][index-18_2.jpg]- 18 -Much Honoured Baroness Lilith of Rachane6, aka“Leadfoot Lil”, the other Terror of Highway #101.Lovecraftians know all to well that, beneath hisalmost-human externalities, Wilbur Whateley wasfinally exposed as a tentacled protoplasmonstrosity.What Michael Aquino’s latest book - thus no lessdamnable than the dread Necronomicon - nowreveals is an even more shocking truth: that beneaththe serene semblance of my revered mentor lurksthe slavering soul of none other than Ed “BigDaddy” Roth’s infamous:But, as one might expect, not your averageasphalt abomination. In these pages you’ll bereading about some very rare, peculiar, andexpensive automobiles - but also about some warwagons, jungle jalopies, Earthly & space speedsters,and perchance some interstellar/interdimensionalinventions as well.As often as not these chapters careen crazily “off-road” into the bumpy backtrails of time and space.6 as she would be formally announced at Buckingham Palace orHollyrood House, the royal residence in Edinburgh.[index-19_1.jpg][index-19_2.jpg][index-19_3.jpg][index-19_4.jpg]- 19 -Clearly when Michael got behind the wheel of one ofhis cars, it was never “just a drive to the cornergrocery”. I daresay what we’ve stumbled onto here isa real-life Calvin in his “Spaceman Spiff” identity:heroically trying to escape the slavering, slobberingalien Zorgs before they turn into the exasperatedteacher Miss Wormwood & the principal, and hissnazzy starfighter an old wooden classroom desk.Michael’s dad, Michael Sr., was like my uncle aWorld War II combat veteran, with a Purple HeartCalifornia license plate on his car, for wounds inaction [in his case in Europe].Michael (Jr.) either didn’t learn or didn’t carethat well-to-do White boys get to stay out of wars.When I met Michael Sr., he talked about Jr.’s being- 20 -a war hero with a chestful of medals, and theirintergenerational love of cats. Both Michaels’ homeshave always been cathouses7 as well as humanhabitats.If “Indulgence Instead of Abstinence” was AntonLaVey’s motto for the Church of Satan, then Michaelthe car-collector took him at his word here. Andthat. gentle reader, is magic. Since I succeeded himas High Priest of Set, you might wonder whether Ishared this passion too? Not in the least: I’m a Texasboy, and my wheels-0f-choice was an ’82 Chevy half-ton pickup. I hauled books and bookshelves for justabout every sci-fi - thanks, EEEE8 - aficionado inthis state - and, in case you haven’t noticed, it’s arather big state. 9One of the things I really liked about that truckwas that you could work on it yourself. You didn’thave to hook it up to a computer to learn that thealternator was on fire. Smoke and flames werecoming out from under the hood. You popped itopen. Yup, the alternator was on fire, all right.It’s amazing how if you have a pickup truckeverybody suddenly wants to be your friend. Ipulled friends out of snow-filled ditches duringfreezing Panhandle winters. I saved lives with thattruck. If there’s a Truck Heaven, she’s earned areserved parking-space.Michael and I do see eye-to-eye on one’sconveyance being a mystical extension of oneself.Our mutual friend Dr. Stephen Edred Flowers, who7 of the Arkte kind!8 “Forry”, get it?9 In 1956 Rock Hudson, Dame Elizabeth Taylor (DBE), andJames Dean [posthumously] made a movie about Texas. Itwasn’t titled Midget.- 21 -reclaimed the 24 Runes of the Elder Futhark, pointsout that the 19th Rune, Ehwaz, is the “Horse Rune”.As such it was the Rune of trust between a man andhis steed. It symbolized Odhinn and Sleepnir, theamazing 8-legged horse. With the right steed a mancan do two things: go into strange & dangerousrealms in search of the unknown, and - moreimportantly - impress your girlfriend.For modern Americans the car has become thehorse. Madison Avenue, television, & movies havemade and remade this myth countless times. So thisbook is a mythology: the saga of one magician’s in-car-nation.In the “occult subculture” masters of magic areseldom anything else; it is a stable of one-trickponies. But Michael’s more of a “Renaissance man” ,with interests from Scouting to Art Deco tosuccessful legislation outlawing “live animal” foodmarkets in California. Suffice it to say that he’s asound scholar of both the exo- & esoteric; he standsup for his friends, both human & animal; and he’spretty good at being visionary.It was 1983, and in the aftermath of losing bothmy father and uncle, I set out on a sci-fi writingcareer while a student at the University of Texas.I decided to take a break and visit CarlsbadCaverns in New Mexico. Cruising along the highwayin my truck, I was passed by a black Cadillac with“666” plates - the driver a man with a widow’s peak,his passenger a raven-haired beauty. They smiled,waved, and disappeared into the distance.After returning to Austin I related the incident toa few friends, and someone mentioned the Aquinosand their car-fondness. Six years later, when Idecided to join the Temple of Set, I recalled thatincident and took it as a favorable omen.- 22 -When I recounted this to Michael, however, hesaid that on that date he’d been in Germany, visitingthe Wewelsburg Castle in Westphalia. And at thatpoint in time he’d owned a Lincoln, not a Cadillac.So my mysterious encounter remained “in theTwilight Zone”.But one mystery had been solved. I’d beenwriting a column for Brimstone under the byline of“Uncle Setnakt”, and Michael’s next words to mewere that he’d just realized who “Setnakt” was; hiseyetwinkle indicated that it was good!There are precious few occasions in one’s lifewhen one senses an adventure is starting; for methis remains one of the best.And while I may not have encountered MichaelAquino on that dark highway those many years ago,I have a pretty good idea where I’ll find him in thefar future: with Uncle Oliver, out at the end of hisdock, as they enjoy a Texas evening fishing forphantoms. I might even conjure a pole and jointhem.[index-23_1.jpg][index-23_2.jpg]- 23 -Author of 24 books including a St. Martin’s Pressmystery series, five nonfiction works on the occult, avolume of poetry, and collections of horror, western,and science fiction stories,10 Don Webb is thewinner of both the Fiction Collective and DeathEquinox Awards, and has been nominated for theInternational Horror Critics Award, the ShirleyJackson Award, and the Rhysling Award.By day an Instructor in Creative Writing at theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, he is also aPriest of the Egyptian god Set, in whose Temple heheld the High Priesthood and attained initiation asan Ipsissimus VI°.

ByBug standards it was impressively advanced: Itactually had a fuel gauge and a lever-controlledheater! Previous Bugs left you gas-guessing and hada floor-screw offering you a choice between freezingand frying. I managed to afford the one dealer-- 26 -option: an AM radio with its one speaker weirdly onthe dashboard to the driver’s left.Also by VW standards it had been given amassive horsepower increase: from 35 to 40. Thiswas enough to get you to 65mph on the freeway withthe wind behind you, but if you had to stop on one ofSan Francisco’s steep hills, there was nothing to itbut coast awkwardly backwards to the bottom andtake another run at it. I once reached the top of theclifflike Jones Street block up to Union only toconfront a stop-sign on the right and a bemused copon the left. I had a choice between anotherbackdown-coast or a sign-ignoring ticket. At the lastsecond the cop laughed and waved me safely ontothe crest at Union Street.Clearly more horses were needed, and shortlythereafter thought I had found them in the form of abolt-on Judson supercharger designed for ænemicBeetles. Curiously this device wanted to be fedsomething with the colorful name of “MarvelMystery Oil”, available at Pep Boys automotiveshops. Thus lubricated, the Judson delivered bothspeed and acceleration. To my delight I was soonannoying Porsche 912s around Santa Barbara, aswell as at least bread-and-butter Detroit Ironcruising State Street Friday nights.What I didn’t know was that blowers add heat toengines, and are sensibly used only briefly fortakeoffs. In the summer of 1965 I was to learn thislesson the hard way while blazing through theSacramento Desert at a speed high enough todemand continuous boost. The daytime desert wasapproaching 100°f, and Beetles had air-cooledengines. In due course I was startled by an explosionfrom the engine compartment, and shortlythereafter notified that the cylinder heads had blown[index-27_1.jpg][index-27_2.jpg]- 27 -themselves into tiny little pieces. No further cans ofMarvel Mystery Oil would ever be needed.What might have been a respectable period ofmourning for my late VW was preempted that fall bya passionate, if unrequited 4-year love affair with amarried woman. Her name was Mrs. Emma Peel,and instead of me, she spent her time with a BritishArmy Major, John Steed. Steed was what one mightcall überEnglish: If he were forced to open histightly-wrapped “brolly” to keep his Bowler dry, theslight bulge resulting from its later reclosure wouldhave caused talk at his club. There was nothing for itbut to nip along to Saville Row and purchase a newone, complete with concealed rapier.Upon finding each week’s avengee [Steed & Mrs.Peel were known in MI5 as “the Avengers”], he wascontent to leave the fist- & footicuffs to hisladyfriend: first the Karate-lethal Kathy Gale, who in1964 changed her name to “Pussy Galore” and losther first fight to an MI6 Royal Navy Commandernamed Bond, though she didn’t seem upset by this.[index-28_1.jpg][index-28_2.jpg][index-28_3.jpg][index-28_4.jpg][index-28_5.jpg][index-28_6.jpg]- 28 -Mrs. Peel was a bit more ladylike, gentlydisabling the obstreperous with Kung Fu. Sheshared with Miss Gale a proclivity for catsuits,though was equally comfortable in gossamer,spandex, or snakes:[index-29_1.jpg][index-29_2.jpg]- 29 -But what especially interested me was her car.Steed’s steed was a 1929 supercharged Bentley,which I can only describe as a locomotive on tires(“tyres”) instead of tracks. Mrs. Peel prowled in asleek little roadster, which I learned was somethingcalled a Lotus Elan.The student community adjacent to UCSB iscalled “Isla Vista”, and in 1965 saw on its streetsmostly muscle cars, VW Beetles & buses, and a fewforeigners: Porsches, MGBs, Austin-Healeys,Sprites. Carroll Shelby, who had recently humiliatedEnzo’s Ferraris at Le Mans with his upstart Cobras,had also taken the gentle little Sunbeam Alpine andstuffed a Ford 289 V8 into it, creating a Corvettekiller called the Sunbeam Tiger. Chevy retaliatedwith an engine-from-Hell: the fearsome L88, whichshook its Vette and the surrounding street even atidle.But there were no Loti. Indeed the nearest Lotusdealer was down in Beverly Hills. Few Isla Vistans- 30 -even knew what a Lotus was, much less had everseen one.I didn’t want another VW, and I couldn’t afford amuscle- or sports-car. Ford was entering theEuropean compact market with its English-FordCortinas, for which Channel City Lincoln-Mercurywas the Santa Barbara dealership. I dropped in for alook-see.Cortinas came in two models: standard & GT.They were pretty and peaceful; the GT was morecosmetic than competition. As I was turning toleave, the salesman said, “Oh, we just got anotherone in. It’s in the warehouse out back; we haven’tcleaned it up yet. Some kind of a flower name. Careto see it?”The “flower car” was a white coupe with anavocado-green flash on each side. At the end of eachflash and on one side of the grille: the “Lotus”medallion.In World War II Nazi Germany added to itsinfamy by creating what became known as “Q-ships”: ostensible, unremarkable freighters whichcould pass Allied warships and coastal batterieswithout attracting attention. Closing in on a convoy,the Q-ship would suddenly hoist the Swastika flagand open disguised hatches concealing six 5.9” gunsand numerous additional anti-ship & -aircraftweapons. After dispatching its prey, the Q wouldrevert to nondescription and sail away under thenoses of any converging warships. 11I was staring at a Q-car. It might look like anyother English Ford, but beneath the surface all of its11 The German Navy coyly called Q-ships “auxiliary cruisers”.The most famous, Atlantis, sank 22 Allied ships, more than 144thousand tons, in the Atlantic during 1940-1 before beingexposed and destroyed by the Royal Navy.[index-31_1.jpg][index-31_2.jpg]- 31 -mechanicals had been Lotized. Under the hood(“bonnet”) was Mrs. Peel’s double-overhead-cam-4engine, fed by twin 40 DCOE Weber carburetors. Onthe dashboard the Ford instruments were replacedby a Smiths 140mph speedometer, 80,000rpmtachometer, & etc., the only dubiosity the inevitableLucas ammeter. 12 The Elan’s exquisite woodsteering-wheel & 4-speed gearshift knob both borethe Lotus enameled medallion. The pièce derésistance was an engraved silver shield atop theblackleather transmission tunnel:That pleasant punctuation was courtesy of JimClark, OBE, who had also won his second FormulaOne World Championship for Lotus that same year.In addition to his F1 wins - at the time of his fatal F2crash in 1968 a world-record 25 - Jim also enjoyedracing the Lotus Cortina, which also that same yearwon eight European Touring Car Challengecompetitions in addition to its numerous victories inprevious years. Jim’s smile is understandable:12 In Britain Lucas is nicknamed “the Prince of Darkness” forits elegant but precarious electrical products.[index-32_1.jpg][index-32_2.jpg]- 32 -“Mrs. Peel” - for so my car was named - and Ienjoyed four years of fantasy, including manystartled and humiliated Porsche 911s, BMWs, JaguarXKEs, and Alfa Romeos.I don’t know how things are for younger driversthese days, but in the 1960s any Californian under25 with a “performance car” was subject toinsurance premiums so high as to effectivelyeliminate this combination. Here again “Mrs. Peel”earned her Q-ship credentials: Both the State ofCalifornia and my insurance company consideredher just another English Ford for registration andpremium purposes. Their delusion might have beenshort-lived had there been more of these white/green things around, but in those same four years Inever saw another one during my extensiveCalifornia drives, or on occasional excursions intoother states as far east as Colorado.Alas, Mrs. P and I parted in 1969, when the Armysent me off to Vietnam. The short life-expectancy ofofficers in Special Operations made a sale prudent.[index-33_1.png][index-33_2.jpg][index-33_3.jpg]- 33 -2: 1968 Dodge M37B1 3/4-Ton Truck1969-1970Luke Skywalker [on seeing the Millennium Falcon]:What a piece of junk!Han Solo: She may not look like much, but she’s gotit where it counts, kid.- Star WarsRichard Nixon sent me on an all-expenses-paidvacation in Indochina from June 1969 to June 1970.For about half that time [we won’t discuss the other[index-34_1.jpg][index-34_2.jpg]- 34 -half], I was assigned as a HA (Command & Control)Team Leader of the 6th Psychological OperationsBattalion (proponency for III Corps Tactical Zone:the quarter of South Vietnam including Saigon) ofthe 4th PSYOP Group (proponency for the entirecountry). As HA-1 I supervised several HE (civicinformation) and HB (combat propaganda) teamsworking with American and South Vietnamese unitsthroughout IIICTZ, as well as elements of MACV-SOG, Regional & Popular Forces (aka “Ruff-Puffs”),Civil Operations & Rural Development Support(CORDS: The Agency, since it was not supposed tobe there under its own name), American & SouthVietnamese (LLDB) Special Forces, and anything/where else the 6th, the 4th, 2nd Field Force (IIFFV)G5, or the Great Old Ones at the Joint United PublicAffairs Office (JUSPAO) of the Department of Statein Saigon might dream up.If you were a field-grade officer “in country”, youusually got your own 1/4-ton truck (civilians still callthem “Jeeps”) & driver. If you were a flag officer(general or admiral), your own UH-1 (“Huey”)helicopter.Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV)Commander 4-star General William Westmoreland(aka “Westy”) had a lavishly-appointed VC-123 forhis personal use, known as the “White Whale”.[index-35_1.jpg][index-35_2.jpg]- 35 -Westy was succeeded as MACV Commander in1968 by General Creighton Abrams, a gruff oldtanker. “Abe” was shocked by the Whale’s opulence,which, while a closely-held no-photos secret, wassaid to resemble Hugh Hefner’s famous “Big Bunny”DC-9:Westy presumably had to do without Hef’s “JetBunny” stewardesses, but his guests included theSecretaries of State & Defense, Bob Hope, Bobby &Teddy K, and USAF Brigadier General JimmyStewart.“Abe” was so repelled by the Whale that herefused to fly in it. Shortly thereafter its decadentinterior was removed and the plane returned toordinary military usage.Down in the jungles of the Iron Triangle and WarZones C & D of IIICTZ, 1st Lt. Aquino soon found hismost useful wheels to be the M37B1 truck. It wassmall enough to go anywhere and carry the numberof people and stuff I picked up in my solo visits tounits, bases, and villages.- 36 -In Vietnam one rarely went anywhere in avehicle without giving a lift to hitchhiking soldiersand locals. It was friendly, and also helped you stayalive if you ran into “situations”. If I were observedto be a community asset rather than an intrusion, Imight make it through the day without getting“greased”.In any war there’s a lot of stuff lost, abandoned,just mysteriously lying around. If I had space in thetruck and came across useful items that didn’t seemto lend themselves to being made into weapons, Iwould toss them in the back of the truck and inviteany villages visited to help themselves. Personalmirrors, toothbrushes/paste, soap, canned food &drinks, brushes, combs, shovels, hammers, blankets,towels, clothing. At times the truck resembled aWild West “medicine show” wagon.The windshield could be folded flat, but as I didnot have a vertical steel bar welded to the frontbumper to cut decapitating wires stretched acrossbackroads by the VC, I left it up. The mechanismwas useful because it had a thumbscrew convenientto hang my M16A1 on while driving.There wasn’t much footroom in the cab, as thefloor was packed with sandbags for added protectionagainst mines.Army trucks didn’t have key-ignitions, just anon/off switch. If you didn’t want your vehicle“borrowed”, you chained/padlocked the steeringwheel to the frame. The only identification was aunit’s name stenciled on the bumper: 6POBN couldquickly become anything else. And, if I may say,vice-versa.Dodge makes good trucks. Mine never oncebroke down, even after being submerged in ricepaddies and jounced in jungles.

Wivesand girlfriends thus welcomed home Creamsiclesincapable of uttering a single sentence without theword “fuck” somewhere in it, and who for the nextmonth would dive out of bed and underneath it atthe siren of a passing firetruck.After about nine months “in-country”, I wasentitled to the honorific of “short-timer”, at whichpoint the soldier would start checking off days on apocket calendar between himself and his Freedom-Bird. The shorter you got, the more paranoid youbecame, hence useless “out in the shit”. If you were“so short that you had to look up to look down”, youwere usually pitied with a desk-job “in the rear withthe gear”.When I began having a hard time seeing over thetops of my jungle boots, I decided that if I had beenforced to leave one Lotus in “the World”, anotherone was going to meet me when I returned. One ofthe “bennies” of being in a combat zone was beingable to do various transactions without duties, salestaxes, and similar privileges of civilization. So Iwrote directly to the Lotus factory in Hethel,England and arranged for the purchase andshipment to San Francisco of Emma Peel’s Elan’snew big brother: a 4-seat Elan+2. In correspondenceI also learned that a livelier version was beingproduced: the +2S. So of course I added an “S” tomy order.- 39 -The Lotus and I both arrived in California inearly June 1970: my Freedom Bird at Travis AirForce Base and the car at the Port of Oakland, whereit sat in a warehouse long enough for someone tosteal its wood/emblem shift knob. San Francisco didhave a Lotus dealer, so I just ordered another one,leaving the management to wonder how I’d snuckthe first +2S in without all the usual Customscomplications.Lotus, like almost all other British cars, had stillthrough the 1960s the reputation of being“temperamental”, which was a polite way of saying“badly built”. If you bought a Jaguar XKE, youprobably wouldn’t get to race Jan & Dean toDeadman’s Curve with it, because it would be in theshop.I had never had any trouble with the LotusCortina, possibly because of Ford glaring over Lotus’shoulder during manufacture. The far-more-expensive and -advanced “pure” +2S boiled over onthe Bay Bridge on the way home from Oakland. Andit was not a hot day, even if a year “in-country” hadleft my baggy green skin a bit insensitive.The dealership found nothing broken, but it wasobvious that the car had been designed for Britain’sclimate, not America’s. The radiator was small, withabout 1/3 of the vanes customary here, while the fanwas a tiny electric toy, apparently borrowed fromsomeone’s office desk.I had a new radiator custom-made, and, sincethis car still had the Elan’s engine, I purchased a fanfrom San Francisco’s English Ford dealer; it boltedonto the +2S block perfectly. The car kept its coolthereafter, even in the Nevada and Arizona deserts.On delivery it was discovered that the electricwindow switches in the beautiful wood dashboard- 40 -didn’t work. They could be replaced under warranty,but it turned out that this would take about sixmonths because the only way to get at them was toremove that entire beautiful dashboard, to whichalmost everything in the car, including the +2S’extra four Smiths instruments in addition to theseveral standard to the car. I settled for two newswitches mounted on the center console, which tookabout 15 minutes.My wife Janet and I were zooming through no-speed-limit Nevada en route to my next Armyassignment at Fort Knox, Kentucky at well over100mph, which the sleek car essayed effortlessly,when Jan noticed a small switch inside the glovebox.Curious, she flipped it, and the car instantly died,along with it almost ourselves. It seems that Hethelhad added a hidden kill-switch to deter theft, buthad forgotten to mention it in the owner’s manual.I had been assigned to the faculty of the ArmorSchool at Fort Knox. We rented a little white housein Brandenburg, a picture-postcard townlet about30 minutes’ drive through the woods from Knox.Brandenburg is famous for a restaurant, the DoeRun Inn, founded by Daniel Boone’s father, and alsofor not having a Lotus dealer. Nor indeed was thereone anywhere in Kentucky. I ordered a complete setof +2S shop manuals from Hethel and crossed myfingers that the local repairs-garage could makesense of them. To my pleasure [if surprise], thisworked out flawlessly.Look closely at the photo of Emma Peel and herLotus, and you will note that the Elan hasdisappearing headlights, a feature brought forwardto the +2 models as well. The rotational mechanismwas not by electric motor, but by vacuum from the[index-41_1.jpg][index-41_2.jpg]- 41 -engine: After starting the car, you could turn on thelights and they would simultaneously spring up.This was clever and fun, except on one stormynight on the freeway in Louisville when a big truckroared past through a big puddle, sending a cascadeof water over the low-to-the-ground Lotus. Thetsunami drenched the distributor under the bonnet,the engine died, and the headlights obliginglydisappeared, leaving me in total darkness at 65mph!Such quibbles aside, the +2S lived up to Lotus’image as the world’s most maneuverable car. Itclung to winding roads as though glued to them; theLotus philosophy of ultralightweight and perfectbalance was, and probably today still is unequalledby any other car constructor. Even when Iexperimentally tried, I could never break the carloose, make it skid, or “burn rubber”. Wherever youpointed it, it would just instantly go there. Such wasthe philosophy and goal of Lotus’ founder, ColinChapman, one of the automotive world’s supermenalongside such immortals as Enzo Ferrari, AlfieriMaserati, and Carroll Shelby.- 42 -One of the secrets of the Lotus Elans’ [and theirpredecessor Elites’] phenomenal handling was thatthey had no chassis in the usual sense. An ordinaryautomobile consists of a steel framework, to whichare attached internals such as engine, transmission,passenger cabin & seats, and wheels/tires. Then allthe external steel bodywork is welded or bolted on.The Elan chassis consisted of a single aluminumI-beam, which split in front to accommodate thesmall twin-cam-4 engine. Steel “Chapman” strutsextended from the I-beam to hold the wheels. Mostof the rest of the car was a fiberglass sculpture whichrested atop & alongside the I-beam. For racing-carsthis concept was ideal. For passenger cars it was noteasily noticeable, and it also provided almost noprotection in case of collision. As I soon discovered.In 1972 I left home as usual and headed towardsFort Knox. It was raining, and from around a blindcurve in front of me, a big Chevrolet sedan lostcontrol and spun sideways into my lane. I hit thebrakes and the light Elan responding by stoppingalmost instantly. But it made no difference as theChevy skidded into me at perhaps 30-40mph.The Lotus virtually vaporized, leaving its engine,the steering wheel in my hands, and myself. MyCorcoran paratrooper boots saved my feet, but bothmy ankles were broken. As I later learned, the bigsedan was barely scratched and its driver, the wife ofan enlisted soldier at Knox, completely unharmed.Something else that Brandeburg didn’t havebesides a Lotus dealer was a hospital or ambulance.It did, however, have a funeral parlor, with a hearseallowing casketed corpses to stretch out full length.So I was taken to the Fort Knox hospital in that,which made for a dramatic and [at leastretrospectively] comic arrival.[index-43_1.jpg][index-43_2.jpg][index-43_3.jpg]- 43 -4: 1965 Pontiac GTO1973-1978Little GTO,You’re really lookin’ fine:Three deuces and a four-speedAnd a 389.Listen to her tachin’ up now;Listen to her whine.C’mon and turn it on, wind it up, blow it out, GTO.- Ronny & the DaytonasGTO (1964)During the three months it took for my twobroken ankles to heal, I was certain of one thing: Iwanted something more than fiberglass between me[index-44_1.jpg][index-44_2.jpg]- 44 -and any future car crash. So I experimented withdifferent creations of “Detroit Iron”, the mostinteresting of which was a 1965 Pontiac GTO. But toingest this Gestalt, a bit of background context:1964 marked a turning-point in American carculture. Prior to that, from the end of World War II,the United States had developed an Eisenhower-eralifestyle quite different from those of Europe or Asia.As perhaps most dramatically envisioned by WaltDisney, America looked forward to a “Flash Gordon”future of exotic and beautiful fantasy. It was notenough for Howard Hughes’ Trans World Airlines tofield voluptuous airliners like Lockheed’s “Super-GConstellation”:... in the care of dashing pilots fresh from Terry andthe Pirates or Blackhawk, and moviestar-gorgeousstewardesses in tantalizing ensembles that DaleArden or the Dragon Lady would have found quiteadequate for court ceremonials on Mongo as well asnoir cloak-and-dagger intrigue here on Earth.Indeed if you found terrestrial jet-settingbecoming a touch too blasé, TWA was perfectlyhappy to fly you to the Moon and back, on one of itsfleet of five Moonliners which lifted off daily fromthe Anaheim, California spaceport it opened in 1955.[index-45_1.jpg][index-45_2.png]- 45 -American automobiles were every bit asfantastic. There were three principal corporations:General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford; each with ahierarchy of companies from the expensive to theeconomical. GM: Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Buick,Pontiac, Chevrolet. Chrysler: Imperial, Chrysler,[index-46_1.jpg][index-46_2.jpg]- 46 -Dodge, DeSoto, Plymouth. Ford: Lincoln, Mercury,Edsel13, Ford.“The General” was easily the most extroverted ofthese. Each year from 1949 to 1961 it created anationally-traveling exhibition of the current year’smodels (which throughout those years changeddramatically annually). Each division had its owndisplay area, with sparkling cars, scantily-clad ladiesto accent them, and one “concept car” incorporatingfuturisms not yet [but maybe soon] available.Reigning supreme over each Motorama wasGM’s corporate concept-car, the Firebird. 14The first three Birds - presented at the 1953,1956, & 1958 Motoramas - are assembled here:13 Named for Henry Ford’s son, the oval-grilled “Oldsmobilesucking a lemon” lasted only 1958-60; its name became acliché for disastrous enterprises.14 Later, from 1967 to 2002, Pontiac would adopt this name forits Mustang-challenger models.- 47 -Of these F1 was the least practical: essentially ajet fighter with wheels instead of wings. It had apassenger capacity of 1, and would break loose fromthe road above 100mph. At least it was unlikely to betailgated: the gas-turbine exhaust exceeded 1,200°f!As the 1950s progressed, America’s automobilesbecame ever-larger jukeboxes of chrome andtailfins, in every imaginable coat & cushion: “landyachts” which, when occasionally reappearing today,are usually sprawled across two urbancrampedparking spaces. They were clumsylumberingdinosaurs, meant for promenades, not performance.This pleasant parade of plushiness came to anabrupt end when, in 1964’s Goldfinger, DesmondLewellyn as the prickly “Q” introduced James Bondto the replacement for his cherished Bentley: anAston Martin DB5 coupé “with a few specialmodifications”.That car appeared in the movie for only 13minutes, but in that time transformed the way thatalmost-adults thought about automobiles. Suddenlyacceptable wheels had to be compact, powerful, andfulfill a checklist including a 4-speed floor manualshifter, matching speedo & tach, full instruments,wood steering wheel, hood airscoop, bucket seats.But there were few Astons in the United States,not to mention that they were as expensive asFerraris. What, oh what to do?The better mousetrap was forthcoming from, ofall places, one of the humbler GM divisions, Pontiac.In 1964 “the Indian” marketed three models: thebig Bonneville “land yacht”, the mid-size Catalinasedan, and the small, spartan Tempest coupé. Thelittle Tempests came with an unremarkable six-cylinder engine, with a V8 option called the “LeMans”. That was it - until some Injuneers saw- 48 -Goldfinger and wondered what would happen ifthey applied that checklist to the Tempest. Nothaving Aston’s haughty 282hp DOHC I6 with tripleSU carburetors15, they found a larger, 389ci V8 andin 1965 put three sequential 2-barrels (the famous“three deuces”) atop it for 360hp. 0-60mph in 4.6seconds; don’t even think about it, Oddjob!Of course the “Goat”, as it came to beaffectionately called, was still a ramshackle Tempestunder the skin: It was suitable for going very fast ina straight line for the short distance of a cruising-strip drag race, aka “count-down at the Christmastree” (traffic lights). Goats didn’t like corners orsudden stops.Unfortunately for me, 1973 proved the wrongestpossible time to indulge in a GTO [or any other kindof “musclecar”: GTO-imitators such as theOldsmobile 442, Chevrolet Chevelle SS396, BuickSkylark GranSport, Shelby Mustang GT-350/500,Plymouth Road Runner, AMC Javelin SST, Corvette427). In October the Arab nations controlling theMideastern oil cartel OPEC got their collective buttskicked by US-backed Israel in the Yom Kippur War,and they decided to level America’s karma with anoil embargo. And back in those pre-frakking daysOPEC had a lock on the non-communist world’s oilsupply.The impact throughout the United States wasboth immediate and catastrophic. The Nixon15 The gadget-fixated Q blew his DB5 budget on machineguns,tyreslashers, and a preposterous ejector seat, leaving no fundsfor the high-performance Vantage Aston equipped with threeof the Lotus Cortina’s Webers. So 007 got a standard DB5 withSU carbs instead. The consensus among Intelligenceprofessionals is that Bond could have easily outrun Oddjob in aVantage. But then he would have been stuck with the icy TillyMasterson instead of the fiery Pussy Galore.- 49 -Administration introduced immediate price- andrationing-controls, a 55mph national speed limit,even/odd license number access to gas stations, etc.In the automotive culture sales and values of“gas guzzlers” plummeted. Manufacturers eitherdiscontinued muscle-cars outright or reduced themto ænemic shadows of their former greatness, oftenwith idiotically-large decals on hoods or side-panels.After the first few years of this purgatory, “thenatives became restless”. Previously law-abidingcitizens began resuming the old speed limits enmasse. Cars bristled with CB (Citizen’s Band) radiosall tuned to the truckers’ channel 18, where“Smoky” (state trooper or highway patrol cars) waslocated and tracked, thus enabling “convoys” ofspeedcrooks to evade tickets. Sales of car radardetectors spiked, as well as creative/concealedinstallations in states where detectors were illegal.The spirit of the Joker, Harley Quinn, Zorro, andGuy Fawkes prevailed.Over time it became worse: Once accustomed toa 55-to-65 crime, drivers increasingly disregardedeven the old limits, with 80-100mph de rigueur onInterstate highways.Gonna write me up a #125,Post my face: WANTED - DEAD OR ALIVETake my license, all that jive -I can’t drive 55! Oh, no!So I signed my name on number 24.The judge said, “Boy, just one more,We’re gonna throw your ass in the city joint!”Looked me in the eye, said, “You get my point?”I said, “Yeah, oh yeah!” ...- Sammy HagarI Can’t Drive 55 (1984)- 50 -In 1987 a frustrated Congress raised the nationallegal speed limit to 65mph, and in 1995 threw up itshands and repealed national speed limits altogether.But it was too late to close the barn door: everyonehad become accustomed to ignoring posted limitsexcept when “Smoky” is present. Drive 65 on anInterstate today and you’ll be blown into the gutter.If the Aston Martin DB5 became the UnitedKingdom’s iconic performance car, and the Ferrari250 GTO Italy’s, a good case can be made forAmerica’s being the 1965 Pontiac GTO. While themodel continued nominally in production until1974, when the OPEC embargo signed its deathwarrant, the years after 1965 had not flattered it.First its fame caused new models to be larger andheavier, and then as first government-nannies andthen the Arabs made muscle-cars increasinglyuntenable, the GTO became a detuned, decalledcaricature of its original glory. There would be analmost-reincarnation 2004-6, but “not quite”.Never before, never again: the mighty GTO.These adventures overlapped with the firstseveral years of the Temple of Set, founded in 1975.While that history is recounted in my The Temple ofSet, this memoir seems an appropriate venue for anamusing “sidebar” in two phases: the Omen series ofmovies.The original The Omen, released in 1976, was aCatholic-atmosphere fantasy of the birth andchildhood of the Biblical AntiChrist, in the person ofDamien Thorn (the adopted son of the AmericanAmbassador to Britain, Robert Thorn.Unlike Rosemary’s Baby, The Omen wasextremely, graphically violent and murderous, withboth of Damien’s adoptive parents and several other“interferers” dead by the end of the film.

He also changed his visage tothat of actor/director José Ferrer so as not to shockthe locals.Of course I knew absolutely nothing of thisbizarre history [and wouldn’t have believed it if Ihad], when Ventura Lincoln/Mercury, knowing ofmy disgust with the current landscape of gutlessOPECars, called me in Santa Barbara to inquire if I’dlike to see a Capri Mr. Ferrer had just sold them,with a strange, green “TURBO” light on thedashboard.A turbocharger disproves the old adage that “youcan’t get something for nothing”. It consists of aturbine, driven by an engine’s exhaust-gases, whichcompresses the air forced into the engine’scombustion-chambers.It proved an ideal solution to the oil-embargo.When the green light flashed on, the little black/green car sprang forward like, well, a spaceship.[index-59_1.jpg][index-59_2.jpg][index-59_3.jpg]- 59 -6: 1982 Lincoln Continental Mark VI1983-1988My pappy said, “Son, you’re gonna drive me to drinkin’If you don’t stop drivin’ that hot rod Lincoln.”- Commander Cody &his Lost Planet AirmenHot Rod Lincoln (1955)A. Art DecarThe Capri RS-Turbo was refreshingly fast andsatisfactorily agile, if not quite as twinkle-toed as theLoti.What it wasn’t was luxurious. Capris were thebudget-compacts of Ford’s Mercury Division. The- 60 -rebodied Battlestar Viper had retained much of itsutilitarian origins.In 1980, having completed my doctorate at theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara, I wasoffered a professorship at Golden Gate University inSan Francisco. The cramped City 17 was no place to“exercise” a car, so the Capri’s green light flashed ononly during weekend excursions down to Santa Cruzor Monterey, or to lunch at the faculty clubs atStanford or U.C. Berkeley. But now, in keeping withmy anointed academic dignities, I felt compelled totry something a bit more dignified and decadent.One day while servicing the Capri at the L/Mestablishment in Burlingame, I noticed a strikingArt Deco sculpture-on-wheels across the showroom.It was, I learned, the new Lincoln Mark VI; and, bysheer chance, this dark bronze example with adevastatingly-voluptuous burgundy-velvet interiorjust happened to be a discounted demonstrator.Seduction was inevitable and immediate. For thenext several years the Herr Professor-Doctorasserted advanced-age and decorum at the expenseof redlines and races.Each excursion immersed in Deco became aweirdfantasy, and to grok this you need to grasp theessence of this artistic atmosphere:Have you looked at a modern æroplane? Have youfollowed from year to year the evolution of its lines?Have you ever thought not only about the æroplane,but about whatever man builds, that all of man’sindustrial efforts, all his computations andcalculations, all the nights spent over workingdraughts and blueprints, invariably culminate in theproduction of a thing whose sole and guiding principleis the ultimate principle of simplicity?17 To its children San Francisco is always “the”, not “a” City.- 61 -It is as if there were a natural law which ordainedthat to achieve this end, to refine the curve of a piece offurniture, or a ship’s keel, or the fuselage of anæroplane, until gradually it partakes of the elementarypurity of the curve of a human breast or shoulder,there must be the experimentation of severalgenerations of craftsmen. In anything at all, perfectionis finally attained not when there is no longer anythingto add but when there is no longer anything to takeaway, when a body has been stripped down to itsnakedness.It results from this that perfection of inventiontouches hands with absence of invention, as if that linewhich the human eye will follow with effortless delightwere a line that had not been invented but simplydiscovered, had in the beginning been hidden bynature and in the end been found by the engineer. 18B. E Luce Ad TenebrasIt was during the 1980s that Lilith and I madethe acquaintance of a television soap opera namedDark Shadows. It had originally appeared on ABC at4PM, at which 1/2-hour during 1966-71 we’d bothbeen unable to see it because of employmentschedules. When initially aired, the series had beenviewable only to housewives and schoolchildren. Butnow it was in syndication and being rerun by localstations, often as late-night filler.Dark Shadows was Archie with fangs. Instead ofbeing chased by gorgeous blonde Betty & gorgeousbrunette Veronica, the hapless vampire BarnabasCollins was perennially pursued by gorgeous blondeAngelique and gorgeous brunette Josette.18 Antoine de Saint-Exupery in Hiller, Bevis, The World of ArtDeco.

Arguably the series endedwhen the few characters still alive and sane chippedin to buy a deadbolt for the Collinwood front doorand just agree to ignore any further knocks!For twenty years thereafter, the original series,much like Star Trek before it, slowly percolated intoa cult classic, spawning annual conventions andtheme-costume events, all graciously attended bythe somewhat-surprised cast & creators. introducingCollinwood to new generations of devotees.Nevertheless the most dramatic epilogue of thegenre came years after the demise of the series, inthe form of several memoirs and novels written bythe series’ two principal heroines, Kathryn LeighScott (Josette) and Lara Parker (Angelique).[index-63_1.jpg][index-63_2.jpg][index-63_3.jpg][index-63_4.jpg]- 63 -C.

Beverly Hills: PomegranatePress Ltd., 2011.- 65 -The bonefreezing ferocity of the narrative,punctuated by moments of madness, melancholy,and pitiful pathos, ambushed me as I peered pastthe cover to the darkness within.From her awkwardly self-conscious annunciationto her final summation, Kathryn’s alter-ego, MegHarrison, undergoes a continuous, relentless ordealof adolescent anxiety, conflicting love, emotionalvulnerability, consuming rage, sexual confusion,self-doubt, and all-too-brief respites before the nextcrushing blow of conspiracy or circumstance. By theEpilogue the reader is as drained and exhausted asMeg herself.Amidst the emerging “women’s liberation” of the1960s, the Playboy Club was an unapologeticFaustian gargoyle gloating over America’s decadentcities. Young ladies, driven by a mixture of ambitionand desperation, found themselves as Bunniestransformed into subservient but unapproachablesex-goddesses, at once enchanting and tauntingmale customers who paid for the momentaryillusion of either control over such loveliness,comfort from it, or at least some small gesture ofinterest by it.Meg’s addiction to this sybaritic circle of Dante’sInferno is haltingly confessed, then dramatized bythe human sacrifice on her personal altar of anelderly lost soul grieving for his long-dead wife. Hissuicide does not reunite him with her, but condemnshim rather as a ghostly servitor of his goddess, a fateat once deeply touching and quietly horrifying.Meg’s experiences as an aspiring actress on“Dark Passages” are no less convulsive. She issurrounded by executives and fellow actorspersonifying every conceivable emotion fromencouragement and affection to jealousy and mortal- 66 -hatred. Her acquaintances range from paragons ofstrength and integrity to careless drunks and forlornrelics.Far from being a detached observer, Meg, as inthe Playboy Club, is mesmerized by the show’spromise of celluloid immortality; despite theconstant consequence of danger to herself andothers dear to her, it never once occurs to her toleave. Only an intense personal tragedy brings her tothis point, ironically reversed by an even moredevastating one.Against this seething tableau of human passionand frailty, Meg’s vampirism seems almost virginalin its simplicity. She can transform, fly, and drinkblood - less as a necessity than as an energy-cocktail.Moral issues about human victims are avoided byMeg’s indifferent killing of sparrows, squirrels, deer,and cats for her pick-me-ups - an oddly heartlessdimension of her otherwise sympathetic character.[There are plenty of New Yorkers who have a goodneck-chomp coming.]Dark Passages is obviously written to provokereaders’ curiosity concerning the apparent allusionsto its author’s Playboy Club and Dark Shadowsacquaintances. Since she prefaces the book with abland denial of any explicitly-intended caricatures,one is left blindly wondering whether MitchellRyan/Anthony George was an alcoholic, JoanBennett was a compulsive upstager, AlexandraMoltke was a Botticelli beauty underneath herlackluster screen presence, or Jonathan Frid andScott were lifelong soul- if not physical-mates. Iwouldn’t have the courage [or the indelicacy] to askher - although the late Mr. Frid gives Dark Passageshis glowing endorsement on its back cover.- 67 -The most chilling personality - the witch Camilla- is far too malevolent to be everyone’s cherishedchipmunk-cheeked witch Lara Parker (who is well-known to be Scott’s good friend). Parker’s Angeliqueis a lonely, tragic figure: seduced in vulnerableadolescence by Barnabas, then rejected by himequally casually. Angelique’s “evil” throughout DarkShadows is always tinged with desperation, notwantonness. The Camilla of Dark Passages is asheartless, as contemptuous of those around her, asthe psychotic serial murderess Catherine Tramell ofBasic Instinct.Dark Passages is not recreational reading.Ultimately the reader is left shaken by theexcruciating candor and intimacy of this “novel”. Itis like peering through a keyhole into KathrynScott’s soul, seeing more than one was meant to see.It is coldly, savagely terrifying. I suspect that shewrote it more as a confession and an exorcism of herpersonal demons, and that few of us would have theintrospection, courage, and honesty to do likewise.Reading a novel is supposed to be entertaining,perhaps suspenseful, perhaps amusing. ReadingDark Passages met none of these expectations: Itwas unnerving, tearing-up tragic, coldly terrifying.But most of all it felt like a violation, an invasion ofpersonal privacy. It feels less a commercial bookthan the author’s private diary which one hasbroken into without her knowledge or permission.Hence as one peruses each new page, there is afeeling of impropriety, even guilt even despite itbeing impossible to stop and not know what’scoming next. It would be distinctly disconcerting toask the author to inscribe one’s copy.[index-68_1.jpg][index-68_2.jpg]- 68 -E.Lara Parker began with a fairly conservativesequel-novel, The Salem Branch, following it withan account of her character’s pre-series life,Angelique’s Descent.What I remember most about Salem Branch -crass gearhead that I am - is that Parker hadBarnabas driving a Bentley. As one of thoseinsufferable fanatics who notice and decry incorrectshoulder-patches in war movies, I was gotchasmug:There are no Bentley dealerships in the entire Stateof Maine! Quelle honte!Angelique’s Descent upset me for a moreprofound [and less adolescent] reason. And franklya very simple one: I like her and want to see herhappy.After viewing the entire run of Dark Shadows, Icame to the conclusion that if the story had anantiheroine, it was Angelique. She was sincerely,helplessly in love with a man who had seduced heras an adolescent, then proposed only to betray her.In a series turning on family and friendships, shehad neither; she was only sought by others to exploither witchcraft skills for their own purposes.Everyone either tried to kill her or had to be killedby her in self-defense. At the very end, having- 69 -sacrificed herself yet again for Barnabas, she dies inhis arms before he can tell her of his forgiveness and[belatedly realized] love.As lifestories go, Angelique’s is painfully tragic.But if I had any hopes that Lara would at leastaccord her pleasant childhood memories, Descentcame as an even more depressing shock.In this journal/novel Angelique is born,apparently illegitimately, to a mulatto slave motherin the French Caribbean colony of Martinique in1774. She escapes from the terrors and hardships ofher childhood and early adolescence by retreatinginto a psychotic dreamworld, eerily echoing JoanneGreenberg’s insane I Never Promised You a RoseGarden (1964).Torn from her Voodoo-obsessed mother by hersadistic landowner father, the little girl is first lockedinto a cage with wild dogs. Narrowly escaping beingtorn to pieces by them, she is imprisoned by herfather, periodically mocked-up as a “Voodoo loa” tointimidate superstitious slaves, then readied forsacrificial murder, which she evades by killing herfather first.Later, working as a domestic for the French-aristocratic du Pres family, the teenager is seduced,then proposed to by a dashing young merchant fromAmerica, Barnabas Collins. Accompanying hermistress Josette to Maine, Angelique is devastatedto discover that Barnabas has discarded her forJosette. And so begins the television-narrative.My sensibilities and sympathies rebelled againstthis sad backstory. Defying the book’s 5-starAmazon review-ratings, I refused to believeAngelique’s Descent, privately promising my friendsome better memories later on [as precounted in #Gbelow].[index-70_1.jpg][index-70_2.jpg]- 70 -F.Then Lara Parker came out with a third novel:Wolf Moon Rising. 22 I acquired it with sometrepidation, but was deliciously surprised:Do you remember that scene in Superman Iwhere Lois Lane was about to fall to her death froma wrecked helicopter, and suddenly ChristopherReeve came running at the screen, tearing his shirtoff to reveal that big red/yellow \\S/ on his chest?All the Boomers in the theater were instantly ontheir feet, tears in their eyes, yelling “GO SUPE! ”while their startled kids gaped at them as thoughthey’d gone completely out of their minds.Well, that’s Wolf Moon Rising. If you were thereto be enthralled by the original Dark Shadowstelevision series - and I don’t mean the painful TV &movie revival efforts - reading this book is like beingmugged by angels: your mind and body end up incomplete disarray but you still feel blessed.Almost everyone from the original gang stillliving [and a few who aren’t] is here. And, in theusual Collins tradition, in lots of trouble seasonedwith romance, violence, and neurosis. All of which22 Parker, Lara, Dark Shadows: Wolf Moon Rising.

What shewasn’t was sexy.

Then you get it: Joan ... Joan Bennett!Good lord. Most of us who watched the originalseries knew vaguely that she’d “been a famous moviestar”, but she was so ... underwhelming as the wan,matronly, passive Elizabeth Stoddard. I don’t thinkmany of us bothered to look her up in thosepreGoogle days.Try it now and prepare to fry your eyeballs: Sheand her sister Constance were full-fledged drop-dead-gorgeous sirens of the Golden Age.All of which makes you cheatread ahead to the1920 flashback to see how Parker rejuvenates her[and her sister!]. It’s deliriously hilarious. WithCollinwood the glitzy setting for a Gatsbyesque orgy,David’s bewildered girlfriend - Angelique’s latestreincarnation - is whisked away by the Bennetts fora head-to-toe makeover.“Flapper or Gibson Girl?” they speculatemischievously, then decree the former. [While thisfits the frenzy of the party and properly stupefiesDavid, I hit an æsthetic snag here: the cool, distant,and aristocratic Angelique is much more Gibson,even though that Grecian-goddess image went outwith the Art Nouveau of the turn of the 1900s.]- 73 -By contrast, the men in the story are just theirusual petulant, grouchy, homicidal selves, spendingmost of their time drinking [though Barnabas andQuentin prefer slightly different cocktails].Barnabas thoroughly alienates his latest objetd’amour, who attracts him because he thinks shelooks exactly like Angelique whom he hates. Yes, Iknow: go figure. Also happens to be the same ladyQuentin has his wolfy eyes on, so you know she’s infor some bummer dates.What Barnabas does manage, for the first timein Dark Shadows history, is to terminally piss offthe ever-loving/loyal/suffering Julia. Way to go,Barney - particularly now that she looks so, um,outstanding.Considering that it’s Lara P. who’s telling thistale, one would think that Angelique would getcenter stage, and some finale fulfillment. Oddly, no.The story spends most of its sequence in a sort ofidentity tag-team between David’s teenage girlfriendand her mother, a worn-out 60s’ hippie whoapparently learned her vocabulary in the MarineCorps. The “real” Angelique just drops into one orthe other of them now and then to confuse thereader and jerk Barnabas’ chain. [I thought that theyfell back in love with each other at the end of theGerard Stiles caper in DS episode #1198, but whatdo I know?]I wish I could tell you that after everything thathits the fan in this book, it at least has a happyending. Well, it doesn’t. Everyone still alive is justcatching a breath before the next troublemakerknocks on the Collinwood front door. ElizabethStoddard could have saved her family considerablegrief by simply installing a doorbell triggering thedoors to an alligator pit beneath the threshold.- 74 -Nevertheless it’s peachy that Lara decided, afterall this time, to fling that door wide open again andlet over 40 years of accumulated Bad News shamblein and run wild in her book.I’ve only one request: For her next one, will sheplease, please let Angelique at last have somesimple happiness: love, snuggles, and laughter [andI don’t mean that famous “you’re in for it now!”wickedgiggle]. 23 The poor girl has it coming.G. The TruthAs recounted above: Upon suspecting the tragictale of Angelique’s Descent to be yet another “coverstory” concealing a deeper mystery, I set out in 2014to see what I might uncover. My search took me tothe libraries of the Louvre & Invalides in Paris, aswell as to the archives of the Papacy in the Vatican.Gradually the pieces of a most remarkable sequenceof events emerged - cumulatively so startling that Idoubt the highlights here will be believed.The story begins in France at the court of LouisXIV, whose celebrated mistress Madame deMontespan retained the King’s affections by arts ofmagic which she learned from the legendaryCatherine Deshayes (1640-80), aka la Voisin.Deshayes was one of many “fortune-tellers”about Paris, becoming noted for her powers ofprescience. In the rigidly-Catholic climate of thecity, this eventually made her a target of the Church,and she was arrested, charged with witchcraft,poisoning, abortions, and Black Masses - all of23 No, she hasn’t forgotten how to do it. At a booksigning Q&Ain the Haight/Ashbury a couple of years ago, someone justasked Lara if she would “do the laugh”. She obliged to astanding ovation.- 75 -which she denied, despite several days of crueltorture by the dreaded Chambre Ardente (theChurch’s secret, inquisitorial court). She was burnedat the stake after spurning absolution by a Catholicpriest.While la Voisin did not betray her clientele, afterher execution her terrified daughter disclosed hermother’s tutelage of Montespan, whereupon Louisimmediately stopped all further investigation.Montespan had seven children by the King, all ofwhom were eventually legitimized, including LouiseFrançoise de Bourbon (1673-1743), whose carefully-selected female students were secretly schooled inthe Arts passed down from Montespan. In duecourse this included the Austrian bride of theDauphin who, upon taking the throne, became LouisXVI. His Queen was the famous Marie Antoinette,and their first child, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, wasborn at Versailles in 1778.The Dynasty of course had hoped for a malesuccessor. “Poor little angel,” her exhausted mothersaid, “you are not what was desired, but you are noless dear to me on that account. A son would havebeen property of the state. You shall be mine.”During the next decade she therefore secretlyschooled her daughter in the Arts of La Voisin.Following the storming of the Bastille in 1789,the royal family was deposed and imprisoned. Louiswas guillotined in January 1793, and MarieAntoinette ten months later.Of the royals’ five children, all but Marie-Thérèsesuccumbed to illnesses. Determined to save her onlysurviving child, during the time before her ownexecution, the Queen arranged for her to beimpersonated by a servant, who became the “Marie-Thérèse” known to conventional history.[index-76_1.jpg][index-76_2.jpg][index-76_3.png][index-76_4.jpg][index-76_5.jpg][index-76_6.jpg]- 76 -Recalling her first words to her daughter uponher birth, Marie Antoinette gave her the new name“Angelique”. She was rescued from the TemplePrison on the night of August 24, 1793 and neversaw her mother again.The impersonation allowed the abduction-trail tobecome cold, and the Queen knew that if thesubstitution were ever discovered, the peasantimposter, as non-nobility, would not be in danger.The Princess Angelique with her ParentsAngelique was taken by her Loyalist protectorsfirst to Monaco, then to the island of Corsica, whereshe became a “daughter” of Carlo Marin diBuonoparte and his wife Maria.In 1779 one or Carlo’s sons had been admitted tothe military academy in Paris, simultaneouslycommencing an affair with the ViscountessJoséphine de Beauharnais, while the Viscount wason extended assignment to the newly-formed UnitedStates, whose Revolution the French king hadactively supported.In 1780 the lovers had a daughter, whom theynamed “Josette” after her mother. Before theViscount returned to Paris, Josette was sent to livewith her father’s family in Corsica.[index-77_1.jpg][index-77_2.jpg][index-77_3.png][index-77_4.jpg][index-77_5.jpg][index-77_6.jpg]- 77 -Josette had just turned 14 in 1793 when the 15-year-old Angelique arrived to become the newest“family member”. Because of their close ages andsimilar “predicaments”, the two girls became closefriends.The French Terror was now at its zenith, andbecause of his title the Viscount de Beauharnais wasguillotined in 1794. Even Corsica was no longer safefor both girls. A close friend of Carlo’s, Count Andredu Pres, offered to let them live with the Countessand himself at their Martinique estate, so Josetteand Angelique left Corsica for the West Indies.While the du Pres considered both girls as familybehind closed doors, in public they representedJosette as their daughter home from school inFrance and Angelique as her maid, minimizingattention to the more-endangered Princess.While later than the 1795 events in Collinsport,in 1796 Joséphine married her lover (now a FrenchArmy General), whereupon they legitimized Josetteas their daughter. In 1804 they would be crownedNapoléon I and Joséphine, Emperor and Empress ofFrance, thus raising Josette to the rank of Princess,co-equal with Angelique.The Princess Josette with her Parents- 78 -As 1794 drew to a close, a hurricane collapsed thebeach-house in which the girls were vacationing.Angelique was unharmed, but Josette was mortallyinjured. The only way Angelique could think of tosave her was to invoke the secret Arts of La Voisin,which until now she had never dared to use, toreunvive Josette as a vampire - which they keptsecret even from their adoptive parents.Shortly thereafter a merchant ship from Mainearrived, with two dashing young sons of the owner,Barnabas and Jeremiah Collins, on board.Angelique fell in love with Barnabas, as didJosette with Jeremiah. Upon becoming aware ofthis, the Count & Countess du Pres, while notdisclosing the actual parentage of either girl, assuredthe suitors that they were both French aristocrats indisguise for their protection.Barnabas and Jeremiah proposed to marry themand shelter them safely in America. A joint weddingwas planned for late 1795 in Maine.Josette and Angelique decided that they woulddisclose the former’s Undeath to Jeremiah uponarrival in Collinsport, and work out a suitableaccommodation at that time.Unfortunately just before the brothers’ shipsailed home, Martinique’s annual Vaval Mardi-Grastook place, with its atmosphere of inebriated revelry.During a wild dance with Josette, Barnabasimpulsively kissed her. Startled, she kissed him back- on the neck - with the result that, despite his lovefor Angelique, he immediately became obsessedwith Josette.When the brides-t0-be arrived at Collinsport,Barnabas rejected Angelique in favor of Josette.Neither he nor the others understood the actualreason for this, dismaying Josette, angering- 79 -Angelique, and infuriating Jeremiah to where hedemanded a pistol-duel, in which both were killed.But that night Barnabas arose as a vampire, andshortly thereafter a distraught Josette, feelingresponsible for the collective tragedy, jumped fromWidow’s Hill - commencing the “official” history ofDark Shadows.- 80 -[index-81_1.jpg][index-81_2.jpg][index-81_3.jpg]- 81 -7: 1987 Lotus Esprit1987-1989I used to go to pieces.

Perhaps that wasultimately what we shared, archaic as others mightsee it. Keep your foot down hard, Phil.- 83 -In 1986 the U.S. Army selected me as the soleReserve officer to attend the General officer-anointing Industrial College of the Armed Forces ofthe National Defense University, located in thepicture-postcard Fort McNair in Washington, D.C.As pleasant as the Lincoln Mark VI was, I wasbeginning to feel that old itch that Lotus leaves withyou. To celebrate, upon arriving in D.C. I tookdelivery of an Esprit Turbo from the dealershipacross the Potomac in Alexandria.It was one dazzling car: pearlescent white with askyblue brushed-suede interior. The Elan enginewas long-gone, replaced by a turbochargedpowerplant behind the cockpit. One didn’t get in anEsprit as much as put it on, like a pair of trousers.Very fast trousers.The Esprit seemed to have no top speed, or atleast I never had the nerve to find it. In Lotustradition it was glued to every bend in the road, nomatter how sharp.As with similar rear-engined sports cars, luggagecapacity was a joke, not to mention a hot one, sincewhat there was of it was adjacent to the engine. Iquickly learned that if I bought carbonated sodacans or pressurized anything, it needed to ride homein the passenger seat if it were not to explode.Lotus liked the Esprit and kept it in productionfor several years, in the midst of which it made abodywork change from origami, e.g. folded-sheet-of-paper, to jellybean, e.g. no sharp edges. As late as1988 Lotus still had a “kit-car” image, of which I wasrudely reminded one day while watching mine go upon the dealership’s hydraulic lift. Suddenly TOYOTApassed before me like Poe’s Raven. When Irecovered from the shock and horror, I discoveredthat the Hethel factory had saved a few £s by using[index-84_1.jpg][index-84_2.jpg]- 84 -red taillight lenses from Camrys, with the ScarletLetters there for anyone with a magnifying glass tosee!After the first couple of Esprit-years, Lotusdecided that the car would look cooler with a rear-deck wing. Grand Prix racers had wings to keep theirbutts on the ground at high speeds. The Esprit wasso æodynamic it didn’t need one, but one hadapparently to keep up with the bat-wingedLamborghini Countach, which had just taken theautomotive-design world by storm.Notwithstanding the many teenaged males whodrooled over Countach posters on their dorm walls,in the flesh it was an inexcusable pain in the ass -beginning literally, since getting in/out of onerequired Yoga prehensility. That dramatic wingneatly obscured what little vision the rear windowmight otherwise have permitted: Reversing the carwithout hitting something required the driver toopen his door and sit on the sill to see. And if youlook closely at the photo, you’ll see that the side-windows are divided horizontally - because thereisn’t room in the door-panel to open them all theway. Just hope for midgets manning the nexttollbooth!- 85 -The Esprit suffered from none of theseindignities, but ... Lotus couldn’t figure out what todo with its wing. One year it would be on the bootlid,the next on the body behind it. The wing itselfmorphed from being Lambobatsy to looking like atotebag carrying-handle. Accessing the luggage-compartment, such as it was, required divingaround the thing, and woe betide the radio antennaif it were not retracted before being sliced in two bya rising wing upon hatch-opening. Seasoned Espritowners could be identified at club events byunbroken antennæ and the absence of explodedshaving-cream or Pepsi on the bodywork.A n y o n e g r o w i n g u p i n C a l i f o r n i a i sweatherspoiled. Once you drive eastward pastDenver, you enter an unbelievable hell of humidheatalternating with snowcold. If the eastern half of thecountry knew what the west is like, everyone wouldmove out here, unbalancing the continent so thatCalifornia would break off and fall into the Pacific.I already knew from my experience with the +2Sthat Lotus knows nothing about Americansummerheat. The featherlight, waisthigh Esprittestified that Britain knows nothing about serioussnow either. Traction during winter requiredsandbags filling the boot, while it wasn’t uncommonto walk outside after a Washington blizzard to findthe car disappeared beneath a soft, white blanket.As far as a true Lotus addict is concerned, “all ofthe above” is insignificant quibble. Life with theEsprit was a blast: Even a dash to the corner grocerybecame a fantasy race through the streets of MonteCarlo, or the 24 hours of Le Mans. Actually arrivingat one’s destination was the most disappointing partof any trip. Like the “transformers” of animatedcartoons, Loti are less vehicles than exoskeletons.- 86 -[index-87_1.jpg][index-87_2.jpg][index-87_3.jpg]- 87 -8: 1989 Ferrari 328GTS1989-1990. . .

[I have devoted mylife to the automobile, which has wonthe human race its freedom.]- Enzo FerrariWhen it eventually came time for Pope John PaulII and Enzo Ferrari to meet, it was the Pope whotraveled to Maranello for an audience with theCommendatore, not the other way around.Ferraristi (as initiates of the Marque are known)would find nothing inappropriate or unusual in this.- 88 -In the Ferrari world there are only twoclassifications of cars: Ferrari and Brand X. Thisshould not be interpreted as snobbiness, just as theFerrari Myth that the famous red cars conceived andconstructed at the Inner Sanctum of the factory inMaranello are in a class of performance andperfection unique to themselves.Enzo Ferrari (1898-1988) was the personalembodiment of the Myth. His lifestory went back tothe dawn of the automobile, when he was a testingand racing driver for Alfa Romeo. He later left toform his own company, which over the decades grewto dominate international motor racing, particularlyin Formula One Grand Prix and Le Mans.The Mussolini regime honored Enzo with thetitle of Commendatore (“[One] Commended [foraccomplishment]”), which stuck even after the fall ofthat government. For the rest of his life he remainedthe “Grey Eminence” of motor racing; no race wouldbe complete without the presence of his red cars.In the early years of Formula One, eachEuropean nation’s cars had a distinct paintcolor:Britain [“British racing”] green, France blue,Germany white (silver), and Italy red. Long afterthis coding ceased, Ferrari continued it, painting theScuderia Ferrari cars Rosso Corsa. Indeed mostroad car owners specified it too, although it wouldalways be possible to order Ferraris in other colors.The road cars were limited in production, andextremely expensive. In the United States therewere/are relatively few dealers, so the sight of aFerrari is still a noteworthy event.After graduating from the ICAF course in 1987, Iwas assigned to the national U.S. Army Reserveheadquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. Lilith and I tooka penthouse apartment overlooking the Central- 89 -West End, which is St. Louis’ interpretation of theHaight/Ashbury or Greenwich Village, with a touchof Georgetown for respectability. On my commute tothe office each morning, I noticed that St. Louis’Volvo dealer also [somewhat incongruously]displayed a Ferrari sign.Yes, said the owner, they indeed got a Ferrari inevery now and then - rarely one of the flagshipTestarossas, and never the sacred F40’s - but ratherthe “bread & butter” model, the 328. One of thesehappened to be en route and miraculously had notbeen spoken for. Was I interested?I was quite gruntled with the Esprit, so felt noespecial pangs. “Please ring me when it comes in,and I’ll take a look.”When it did come in and I did take a look, it wasa decidedly strange experience, like being calledover to Wright-Patterson to check out the latest UFOin Hanger 18. The 328 was one of the targa GTSmodels, Rosso Corsa [of course] over tan leather.British, German, Japanese, American leather carinteriors have no scent. The one radiating from theFerrari was strong and mesmerizing.Everything about the car was weirdly alien. Onenever starts a Ferrari without fully depressing theclutch, and the pattern of the [only] manual 5-speedgears was inverse, with 1st down instead of up. Andwhen that engine started, it did so with a basswhoop unlike any other engine I’d ever heard. Irecalled one reviewer’s speculation that Ferrariengines have various extra/unnecessary parts intheir mechanisms just to make exotic music.Incidentally that was all the music a trueFerrarista needed/wanted to hear. Nothing asblasphemous as a radio came with the car, althoughthere was a hole in the dashboard if one insisted on- 90 -defiling it. [So as not to disturb the leather door-panels, however, a couple of cheap speakers werepre-buried behind them.]Apart from the aromatic leather itself, the sole“extravagance” insider the car was the sacred yellowhorn button containing the black Ferrari Cavallino(Prancing Horse). 24The 328 contained nothing as feminine as aglove-compartment. In an apparent, grudgingconcession that male owners might want to allowwives or girlfriends to occupy the passenger seat,there was a tiny, cheap mirror affixed to the back ofthe passenger-side sunshade.While the dealership invited test-drives in any ofits Volvos, a test-drive of the 328 was out of thequestion. Would you want anyone else to sleep withyour fiancée before you marry her?!Only a confirmed automaniac would purchasesuch a car under such conditions, so of course Iimmediately did.Upon turning the ignition key, I was initiatedinto the secret of the Marque guarded by allFerraristi: Driving a Ferrari is a subliminal sexualexperience. Loti are lighter on their feet and handlebetter, Corvettes & Cobras are more muscular,Jaguars & Maseratis are more luxurious, Mercedes& Porsches are better-built, Lamborghinis & Astonsare more exotic. Only Ferraris have sex with youevery time you turn the key.24 Heathens who blasphemously mention that the Porscheinfidels also have a black horse against yellow at the center ofthat garagista emblem are admonished that it is the coat ofarms of the city of Stuttgart, from the High GermanStuotgarten (stud farm), hence the horse shown is a mare;whereas the Ferrari Cavallino is artistically-explicitly astallion.[index-91_1.jpg]- 91 -"},{"pageContent":"In 1965 John Frankenheimer decided to make awidescreen spectacular about Formula One racing,which was released the following year as GrandPrix.

The several races werelinked together with human soap opera, but thereally steamy stuff was out there in the streets ofMonte Carlo and the tracks at Clermont, Zandvoort,Brands Hatch, Monza.Obviously Ferrari participation was essential, soFrankenheimer made the pilgrimage to Maranello.To his dismay, Enzo turned him down: A film withFerraris was unthinkable unless they won.But Grand Prix was an American film, and theclimactic World Champion had to be an American(James Garner), driving a quite unEuropeanJapanese car entered by Toshiro Mifune.Disaster was averted by a typically Enzocompromise: The Ferrari team would be en route tovictory in the final Monza race, when one of itsdrivers (Yves Montand) would be killed when abroken-off piece of another car caused his to crash,killing him.

The most active suchappearance was that of Phil Hill, as one of Garner’sco-drivers on the Japanese team. Amusingly, whenGarner asked Mifune why his other drivers were notbeing criticized for mistakes, he answered “Becausethey are not winners.” Hill was of course the 1961World Champion, and graciously allowed Montandto pretend to that title in the film. Hill’s quote at thebeginning of Chapter #7 in this book was also in thefilm, conversationally spoken by Montand to EvaMarie Saint, shortly after another driver’s crash.But the most unforgettable impersonation wasthat of Enzo Ferrari by Italian superstar Adolfo Celi:- 93 -The photograph above survives from theirmeeting at Monza in 1965 during the shooting of themovie’s dramatic finale - arguably not only a world-championship contest of cars, but of Roman noses.An amusing snippetrivia deserves rescue fromyears of forgottenness:In 1967 the James Bond establishment EonProductions was horrified by the appearance of thefirst “spaghetti spy movie”: a Bond lampoon by thename of O.K.

Here comes the movie,” and in Venice, it’s veryelegant, and respectful ... It’s decadence. It’s such a funway to formalize a movie that is for us a down-and-dirty, gritty movie. And to see it with the red carpet,and rolling up in a Maserati.- David Gordon GreenBologna, Italy, 1914: The six Maserati brothers -Alfieri, Bindo, Carlo, Ettore, Ernesto, and Mario -decided to build and race cars. Mario, an artist, gavetheir new company its famous emblem, taken fromthe city’s famous statue of Neptune.[index-96_1.png][index-96_2.jpg][index-96_3.jpg][index-96_4.jpg]- 96 -Eventually the company moved to its presenthome in Modena, and over the years becameFerrari’s principal rival in both racing and sportingroad cars. Characteristically Maserati preferredtwin-overhead-cam 6 engines to Ferrari’s V12, andthe Trident cars were unashamedly morecomfortable and luxurious than their Cavallinocounterparts.Among Maserati’s many motorsport triumphswere Juan Fangio’s 1957 F1 World Championship ina 250F, as well as Wilbur Shaw’s 1939 & 1940Indianapolis 500 victories in a 8CTF.The post-World War II period was not an easyone for expensive European cars. Legendarymarques like Bugatti had disappeared, and Ferrarisurvived only by being purchased by Fiat in 1969. In1968 Maserati was purchased by the Frenchcompany Citroën, and then in 1975 by theArgentinian racing driver-turned-entrepreneurAlejandro de Tomaso.Instead of voluptuous Gran Turismo cars likethe previous Mistral, Ghibli, & Khamsin (all namedfor famous winds), de Tomaso envisioned small,practical, but powerful & luxurious coupés & sedans.The mammoth straight-6 engines were replaced by acompact V6 mounting twin turbochargers, hence thenew generation’s name “Biturbo”.- 97 -The first Biturbos began to reach the UnitedState in 1985, and quickly developed a reputation forbeing blindingly-fast but unreliable. Initialbodywork quality was also somewhat less thanGerman-precise. Indeed almost all Italian exoticsshared an “Italian” image that no two body-panelswere identical.De Tomaso worked furiously to fix the defects,and succeeded: By 1989 the Biturbos weremechanically impeccable, as well as showpieces ofboth bodywork and interior lavishness. “The onlyway to be surrounded by more leather and suede,”commented one reviewer, “is to get inside a cow.”Also working against the Biturbos was their Q-ship appearance, recalling the ordinariness of theLotus Cortina. They just didn’t look like the “classic”Maseratis, even if they were better-built and wouldhold more people more comfortably, with plenty ofluggage-space.So 1989 was Maserati’s last year in the USA. Itwas also the year when, thinking about areplacement for the Lincoln Mark VI, I visited theSt. Louis Maserati store and found Alejandro’smasterpiece, the 228.As noted: From the outside it was the last caryou’d notice in a pack, a big, metallic-brown coupé.If you removed the Trident emblems, you wouldn’tknow what it was.The blush-tan leather interior, on the otherhand, was something out of a Borgia palace. Theseats were not only more comfortable than any othercar’s; but any house-furniture as well. Within 5minutes of sinking into the front-passenger seat,Lilith was invariably blissfully asleep. The rear seatswere if anything more intoxicative: Driving a carfulof passengers was rather like piloting a hearse.[index-98_1.jpg][index-98_2.jpg]- 98 -Like its Trident brethren the 228 was blindinglyfast. The twin turbos gave it instantaneous, GTO-like acceleration, such that - also like the Goat - thechallenge was to hold the car to a controlled straightline. Unlike the Pontiac, however, the Maser wasbuilt for European-Autobahn speeds; in our weenielegal environment it barely broke idle in gear #3 outof its 5, at 70mph. I have no idea what the 228’s topspeed was; I never had either the highway or thecourage to find out.Which brings to mind another bit of slapstick:The 228 had beautiful, jewel-like instruments[Maserati dash clocks are world-famous goldensculptures]. But with stereotypical Italian indolence[or insolence], the factory hadn’t bothered tocalibrate the speedometer. Shortly thereafter, on theI-280 Interstate in California, I was red-lighted by aCalifornia Highway Patrolman for 90mph in a 65zone. But the speedo said 65!? I took the car to ashop where the wayward instrument was diagnosedand calibrated. Shortly thereafter I was in Redwood- 99 -City’s traffic court. The judge read the ticket aloud,then asked the brand of car. I said “Maserati” ashumbly as possible, whereupon the courtroomexploded in laughter. Let’s see a Maser get out ofthis!But the paperwork from the shop did theimpossible; His Honor joined in the laughter andtore up the ticket.That said, the Q-ship 228 never attracted Smoky-attention like the Rosso Corsa Ferrari 328GTS. Ihave come to the conclusion that Ferraris areassigned their own CHP tails once sighted.Driving up to Chicago one weekend with acomatose Lilith, I decided to visit the Ferrari/Maserati facility there, which was in a small suburbby the name of Lake Forest. Thus began twounexpectedly creepy days.If you ever saw the original Katherine Rossmovie The Stepford Wives, well, it must have beenfilmed in Lake Forest, Illinois. I don’t know if it’sstill like that today, but in the 1980s it was a picture-postcard town. 110% Caucasian. Manicured treesand flowerbeds everywhere. Not only was there nota speck of litter anywhere, but not even a stain onany sidewalk or street. The service stations hadcourteous, bow-tied attendants. Every pedestriansmiled warmly at you. The Disneyesque hotel wasimmaculate and featherbedcomfy. All foodeverywhere was delicious. Even the F/M dealershipwas unItalianny pristine.In short, Lake Forest was terrifying, and wecouldn’t escape from it fast enough.Oh, yes, about Italian-exotic dealerships: They’vebecome very upperclassy today, but as late as the1970s: Well, in San Francisco the Maseratidealership was just an old, ramshackle garage on a- 100 -Russian Hill backstreet, and Ferrari was in a similardump down by the Wharf. Neither place had a sign.You either knew about it or you didn’t. If you walkedinto the garage, you might see a few cars there. Tofind out if one were for sale, you had to interruptone of the mechanics, who doubled as salesmen.By the 1980s this was still par for Ferrari [exceptin Lake Forest]. Alejandro de Tomaso, on the otherhand, had decreed that his customers be treated likeroyalty. No matter what the 228 needed, anywhere,anytime, Maserati USA would instantly see to it. It’sbecome as much a signature as Maserati clocks andtrumpet-horns; to this day Maserati ownership canonly be described as coddling.The collapsing exotic-car market in 1990 saw theexit of Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and severalothers. The de Tomaso Maseratis lingered for awhilein Italy and Britain, then died out, a great pity; theirelegance and comfort have never been approached,much less matched since.Maserati not only coddles current owners, itremembers previous ones. After owning several ofthe marque over the years, I was surprised to receivea solid gold, deeply-enameled “MASERATIF I D E L I T A T E M H O N O R A T ” g r i l l e - b a d g e .Unfortunately actually attaching it to the 228’s grillewould be insane: In a very shot time it would beripped off to become some gang-punk’s belt-buckle.So it has since remained a preserved heirloom, alongwith its companion - a desk-version of the famousMaserati dash-clock. Not content to stop theretimewise, Maserati went on to commission a line ofwristwatches in these-days-rare rose-gold. Marquewatches have since become both widespread andexhibitionist, but Maserati’s remain subtly dignified:distinguished but never ostentatious.[index-101_1.jpg][index-101_2.jpg][index-101_3.jpg][index-101_4.jpg]- 101 -In 1993 de Tomaso sold the now-dormantMaserati to Fiat, which in 1997 sold it to itssubordinate company Ferrari, Maserati’s ancientrival.Nevertheless it was the best thing that could havehappened to the Trident, because after decades offinancial cliff-hanging, it was now under the sameFiat umbrella as Ferrari. The factory was completelyrebuilt, and a new line of cars created: luxury GrandTouring exotics in the US$150K range rather thanFerrari’s US$500K. Ferrari designed and built thenew V8 with “Maserati” on the cam-covers. Unlessyou just had to have the Cavallino on your hood, itwas a much more comfortable “Ferrari” for afraction of the pricetag.What Fiat and Ferrari didn’t assume was anyinterest in/responsibility for the de Tomaso orearlier cars. As of 2017 Biturbos have virtuallyvanished from the used-car markets. A pity justwhen they had been perfected. And as nice as theFerrari interiors are, they are nowhere near assumptuplush as Alejandro’s. Passengers stay awake!- 102 -[index-103_1.jpg][index-103_2.jpg][index-103_3.jpg]- 103 -10: 1989 Ferrari Testarossa1990-1992Detective Sergeant James “Sonny” Crockett (seeing hisTR for the first time) “340 horsepower, 180 milesan hour, new paint, new rubber ...”Detective Sergeant Ricardo Tubbs: “Absolutelyessential for any type of serious police work.”Sonny: “You got that right!”- Miami ViceSeason 3, Episode 2 (1986)When in 1983, well into the decade of“conspicuous consumption” characterized by goldchain necklaces, expensive clothes, and exoticautomobiles, Hollywood producer Michael Mann- 104 -proposed a new cops-series set in Miami,emphasizing the Reagan “war on drugs” and relatedbig-money, high-lifestyle criminality, the city fatherswere horrified by what this would do to Miami’srespectable image. Imagine their discomfiture whenMiami Vice transformed the peaceful vacation-spotinto the world’s most glamorous locale - for all thewrong reasons! Miami was now a seething hotbed ofcocaine, prostitution, “cigarette”-boat racing, beefyguys and busty girls, and above all obscenely exoticautomobiles.Sonny Crockett started out in 1984 driving aFerrari Daytona Spyder - a black convertible. It wasactually a rebodied Corvette, but the average viewercould not tell the difference (easily apparent fromthe car’s interior). The car soon became as much astar of the show as its passengers and Sonny’s petalligator Elvis.Supposedly Sonny’s undercover persona as abig-bucks drug-dealer necessitate the Metro-DadePolice Department issuing him a suitableconfiscated car. Nevertheless the choice raisedFerraristi eyebrows: The Daytona Spyder was one ofthe most valuable collector Ferraris, with a marketvalue of $4 million. One would think that M-Dwould have been a bit less extravagant with itsinventory!Be that as it may, in the finale of Season #2, anon- Ferrarista bad guy blew up $4M of M-D’sbudget with a stinger missile, forcing the deprivedDetective to pound on his [Lamborghini-driving]Lieutenant’s desk for a socially-acceptablereplacement. Edward James Olmos curtly cut himshort: “It’s out back.” - prompting the quotebeginning this chapter.- 105 -The sensation of Miami Vice had not goneunnoticed by Ferrari North America. While certainlyhaving nothing to do with the “Daytona” Corvette,Ferrari now contributed one of its current signaturemodels, a 1986 Testarossa (“Red Head” [for its cam-covers], or conversationally “TR”). While TRs werealso mostly Rosso Corsa, such would have clashedwith the Miami-pastel tints of the series, includingSonny’s trademark-white suits and loafers. Ferrarididn’t have any TRs in the series’ [& MiamiDolphins’] orange & aqua livery, so Sonny got awardrobe-matching white.In 1989, less than a year into my 328GTS, Ibegan wondering about its big brother: more room,greater comfort, more luggage-space, not to mentionthat legendary flat-12 instead of a V8. I telephonedFerrari Houston to inquire. Yes, they had severalTRs, including a very nice company-executive ’89 inwhite/tan, at a discounted $160K [since it wasn’t thesacred red]. “We’ll buy your 328 for $130K.”I’d purchased the 328 at its $80K sticker-priceonly a few months previously! I began wonderingwhy I was bothering to work for an Army salary if Icould just buy/drive/resell Ferraris. TheCommendatore had recently departed his personalracetrack at age 90, and the value of cars madeduring his lifetime was skyrocketing. TRs wereprojected to surpass $1M in another year or two.I decided it would be fun to play vice cop forawhile. A short time later the small red fireball inthe Army headquarters parking lot each day wasreplaced by a gleaming white spaceship.Like its little brother, however, the TR had itsbizarre Maranello quirks:• The big seats were manually adjusted by threelevers, one of which didn’t do anything.- 106 -• There was a glovebox this time, which couldonly be opened electrically, so don’t keep anythingin there you’d need in case of a dead battery.• Those dramatic, signature cheese-grater“strakes” on each side were made of light aluminum,very delicate. One doesn’t park a TR in danger ofopening-door impacts from other cars unless onewants to fund the local bodyshop-owner’s entirevacation.• The front hood latches didn’t like any torsionfrom irregular roads, and wold fly open in protest.• The Italian A/C was prone to freezing-over inreally hot Missouri summer weather, ceasing to coolpassengers.• That high left-side-view mirror on Sonny’s 1986didn’t have a right-side counterpart because itwouldn’t be visible. [The’89 fortunately had twolower/visible mirrors.]• Sonny’s car also had the original “knock-off”wheels. That means to remove a wheel you had tobash the single big bolt in the center with a leadmallet in the toolcase. [Also fortunately by 1989 thewheels had the usual 5 lug nuts.]• TRs are very wide, to allow for that wild sidebodywork. Great attention needed to be paid tostreet & freeway lanes, as well as garage-dooropenings.• The TR is a very low car, with side skirts/panelseven lower. The entire nose of the car has a blackfiberglass chinpiece beneath it: extremely expensiveto replace when you’ve destroyed it on a steep hill ordriveway, pothole in the street, or parking-lotcement obstacles. All those high-speed car-chasesSonny made through Miami necessitated streetsconsiderately chosen by the crooks for their glasslikesurfaces.- 107 -• Everything about Ferrari is $$$, includingparts made by Fiat which would have costsubstantially less if for Fiats. A major service on thatmagnificent flat-12 cost $5K!• The TR’s luggage space was under the fronthood, together with a small shelf behind the seats.While more than the 328’s, this was still minimal.Ferrari offers custom luggage for its cars, made bythe exclusive Italian company Schedoni. There was a4-piece set for the 328 and a 6-piece for the TR.Both sets were gorgeous, aromatic Italian leatherwith beautiful brasswork and of course plenty ofdeep-stamped Cavallinos. Each case came with itsown protective cloth bag.As can be imagined, these Schedoni sets werealso $$$ - so much so that it would be unthinkableto leave them in a hotel-room or check them at anairport. Most Ferraristi left them at home in theirprotective bags, and used junky old soft cases forany car-travel. Ferrari Club newsletters often hadfor-sale sections for Schedoni sets as well as cars.• The 328 had that wonderful, sexy exhaustgrowl. Surprisingly the more powerful TR was asquiet as a Chevrolet. [Again, what you hear onMiami Vice are sound-effects.] To get this Ferrari tosound like a Ferrari, an aftermarket muffler fromthe Italian company Tubi is necessary - for about$4K!All these exclamation-points aside, the TR was adevastatingly-fantastic car to drive. And everywherethe immediate center of attention. Everytime Istopped at a gas station, I had to reserve twice thetime for guided tours, and innumerable photo-ops ofmen, women, teens, and kids perched in the driver’sseat. I became a one-car recruiting promo for theMiami Police Department.- 108 -In 1990 Lilith and I moved home to SanFrancisco, and I discovered that the TR did not carefor SF’s steep hills & driveways [that chin,remember?], or for the City’s narrow streets andcramped parking-spaces. Also the TR’s handbrakewould not hold the car on a steep hill - a necessityfor driving here with a manual transmission. So,sadly, “Sonny” had to retire - fortunately just beforethe inevitable collapse of the Ferrari market in theearly 1990s. I didn’t make that $1M, but at least Ididn’t lose my shirt either.Several years later - around 1998, I think - I wasjogging on my usual route through Aquatic Park andsaw Don Johnson relaxing by his mobile dressing-room between takes of his Nash Bridges police-series. I took a breather, and we shared a fewminutes of MV-nostalgia, including TR-quirkiness,all of which he too recalled with a chuckle. He’dforgotten how many fiberglass chins he’d shattered.[index-109_1.jpg][index-109_2.jpg][index-109_3.jpg]- 109 -11: 1990 Chrysler/Maserati TC 16V1990-1995The best-looking Italian to arrive onthese shores since my grandmothercame over.- Lee Iacocca, 1989During his efforts to revive Maserati in the1980s, and particularly to break into the lucrativeAmerican market, Alejandro de Tomaso made itknown that he was looking for an American investoror partner. In 1987 he though he had finally foundone; Chrysler’s Lee Iacocca acquired an option topurchase a major interest in Maserati.[index-110_1.png][index-110_2.jpg][index-110_3.jpg][index-110_4.jpg]- 110 -Despite, or perhaps because of, their aggressivepersonalties, the two men immediately decided tocreate a joint sports-car. The chassis bodyworkwould be built by Chrysler to its rigorous quality-control standards, then the car would go to theMaserati factory in Modena for its interior andmechanicals.Most of the cars would receive a 160hp Chryslerturbocharged 4 mated to a Chrysler 3-speedautomatic transmission. In this configuration thecar - officially “Chrysler’s T[urbo] C[onvrtible] byMaserati” - was a silky-smooth vehicle for theaverage owner more interested in comfort andimage than high-performance.For enthusiasts who were seeking thatperformance, a select few of the TCs received aMaserati 16-valve double-overhead-cam-4 engine(similar to that of the Lotus Cortina/Elan, but 200instead of 115hp), mated to a German Getrag 5-speed manual transmission. Externally the only wayto tell the two apart was a small “16-Valve” emblemon the front-quarter panels of the Maserati-enginedcar.The interior was every bit as lush as the 228:[index-111_1.jpg][index-111_2.jpg][index-111_3.jpg][index-111_4.jpg][index-111_5.jpg][index-111_6.jpg]- 111 -The TC was so completely-equipped that therewas only one option: a CD player for the shelf belowthe sound-system.In addition to its fully-lined convertible soft-top,the TC had a removable hardtop, complete withglass “opera” windows etched with its “Pentatrident”logo. The embossed-leather toolkit included,charmingly if mysteriously, a Swiss Army knife. Inthe lined storage compartment behind the seats wasa log0-umbrella. As a finishing touch, each ownerreceived in the mail a gold-engraved console plate:The TC was priced at $30K - high for a Chrysler,but half the price of a Maserati. It came with a 5-year Chrysler warranty, and unlike Maserati couldbe serviced at any American Chrysler dealership.- 112 -What was not to like? As far as I was concerned,absolutely nothing: The TC embodied the best ofevery sports car I’d previously driven, and at a pricematched only by [in 1966 dollars] the Lotus Cortina.However the TC got off to an unhappy start evenbefore the first finished cars arrived in this country.Shortly after completing this wonderful work ofcollaborative art, Alejandro and Lee decided theydidn’t like each other so much after all, and Chryslerdeclined its investment option, essentially doomingthe financially-precarious Maserati firm. WhileChrysler had committed itself to three years’ TCproduction, the death-sentence thereafter was nosecret, and dealerships treated inventory much asout-of-wedlock children. TCs usually sat in back lotsrather than showrooms, and few salesmen knewanything about them [or Maserati]. Purchasing minewas thus déjà vu the Lotus Cortina, with the dealerutterly clueless concerning this inventory oddity.For my part, seeing the already-minusculeMaserati dealership network [read parts & service]disintegrating, the decadent 228 had to go - but theTC seemed its perfect reincarnation, less two rearseats. I had to look around a bit to find a Chryslerdealer more frightened of his TC allotment than the228, but finally did in Indianapolis. Just asmanagement knew next-t0-nothing about the TC, itknew even less about the dark clouds overMaserati’s United States future.Meanwhile the American motoring press, onceaware of the de Tomaso/Iacocca falling-out,pounced on the still-not-yet-arrived TC as the latestEdsel-debacle. It mattered not at all that mostcolumnists who burned the TC at the stake in theirpublications hadn’t even seen one, much less drivenit. It was ugly, clumsy, overpriced, uncomfortable- 113 -(?!), front-wheel-drive despicable, underpowered[few mentioned, presumably knew nothing aboutthe Maserati-engine option]. There were not enoughreprehensible adjectives in the dictionary to hurl atthis monstrosity.That uncouth and absolutely-undeserved cursehas stuck to the TC ever since its 3-year salespresence. It invariably appears in scornful lists ofhistory’s ten worst cars, along with theaforementioned Edsel, Ralph Nader’s despisedCorvair, the Yugo, and the Zil.Indeed it was that same curse that eventuallycaught up with my beloved 1990 16V: a beautifulrose-red with black-leather. Not only did the TCdisappear from American dealerships after 1991, butthe number of such facilities willing to service thecar gradually shrank to nonexistence. And asMaserati in Italy also closed its doors, parts for theMaserati components of the car, including itswonderful engine, also disappeared.At this writing a very few TCs - almost all theChrysler automatics - still exist, most in varyingstates of inexorable deterioration. All these years avaliant, dedicated lady, Karleen Tarola, has almostsingle-handedly established and maintained the “TCAmerica” club to provide communication, resources,and social events for those who still revere thismagnificent work of automotive art.My limited resources and garage-space havepitilessly combined to prevent my keeping everysingle one of my metallic friends memorialized inthis book. But if I could ever get just a few of themback, the TC would be the very first I’d grab. Untilthen, its little golden nameplate will have torepresents it sadly in my study, like Poe’s raven.Thanks, Alejandro, Lee, Karleen, for the dream!- 114 -[index-115_1.jpg][index-115_2.jpg][index-115_3.jpg]- 115 -12: 1989 Ferrari Mondial-t Coupe1992-1995Second is just the first of the losers.- Enzo FerrariLook closely: Yes, that’s indeed “Leadfoot Lil”behind the wheel of our t.During the 1980s Ferrari offered four models: asmall V8 spyder/berlinetta (the 308 GTS/GTB, 328GTS/GTB, & 348ts/tb), a signature flat-12 (Boxer,Testarossa, 512TR), a supercar (288GTO, F40),and ... something with 4 seats for the regrettably-domesticated. This last was the Mondial (8, 3.2, &finally in 1989 the -t).“4 seats” is not quite accurate. Like anyEuropean sports car, the code-description “2+2”- 116 -means 2 normal front bucket seats and an elaboratework of art behind them that incorporates all thefeatures of 2 seats, including seatbelts, arm- head-rests, with no space for legs/feet and higher-upspace for only very small double-amputee children,or small dogs. Among the most famous such artistsare Porsche, Jaguar, Lotus, Aston Martin, andFerrari. The rumored explanation is that there aresome countries in which 4-seat cars are taxed muchlower than 2-seat.The Mondial got off to an uncertain start for afew other reasons as well:•- It looked funny. Its engine was still in theback, resulting in a short nose and long rump, whichsimply appeared big-butt ungraceful.•- Until the -t came along in 1989, it wasunderpowered, sharing its engines with the lighter308/328s.•- Until the -t, the front seats were unsupportive,ugly hammocks.•- Until the -t, the sides incorporated overlarge,awkward side-strakes of no functionality.•- Somehow the car managed to look worse, andwas heavier as a hardtop, so the vast majority werebuilt as convertibles (“cabriolets”). You won’t findmany photos of these with their tops-up, becausethus they were even uglier, besides which themanual tops were a tug-of-war to both erect andlower/store.•- As seat/shoulder-belts became mandatory inthe United States, the cabriolet’s inter resembledShelob’s spiderweb from The Lord of the Rings.•- Despite being such a long car, the Mondial stillhad only a tiny, 328-like luggage compartmentbehind the engine, and the rear seats didn’t folddown.- 117 -The good news is that in 1989 the Mondial-tcoupé fixed every single one of these problems. Thebad news is that only 43 of these coupés were sent tothe United States, making them almost as rare as theLotus Cortina.Before you ask, the “-t” stands for “transversal”.In amusing Italogic, the engines of the 8 & 3.2 weremounted transversally, with the -t’s mountedlengthwise. But since it was still in the back, thetransmission had to be mounted sideways, hencesaid “-t”.When “Sonny” the gleaming white Testarossaproved undrivable & unparkable in the cramped &vertical confines of San Francisco, I discovered oneof the -t coupés at the local dealership - the only onein this country in a soft metallic grey ( Grigio)instead of the usual Rosso Corsa. So “Sonny” wenton to a better home in the wide open elsewhere,while I continued my Cavallino compulsion with his“sedate” cousin.If the 328GTS and evenmoreso TR had causedrubberneckidemics and dedicated highway patroltails, the -t once again emulated the Lotus Cortina asan unnoticed Q-ship. It was, as blasphemous andcounterintuitive as it sounds, a downright practicalFerrari. That must be why the factory produced onlya handful of them, and for that one year only. Eventhe back seat folded flat-down into a scandalouslyreal luggage-area! Also Ferrari-uncharacteristicallythere was a dashboard switch for three shock-absorber settings, from the “racetrack” to “SanFrancisco pothole”. But so that Lilith and I wouldn’tget too spoiled by such capitulations, the earlierMondials’ glovebox was 328-removed - apparentlyjust for spite, since plenty of empty space remainedbehind the solid steel dash panel.- 118 -The -t was fitted with the V8 of the 328’s 1989successor, the 348tb/ts, producing 300hp andgiving the car a 170mph capacity if I felt naughty(frequently) or CHP-invisible (rarely).Ferraris [O.K., all of these cars] aren’t habituallydriven to get somewhere or support some otheractivity. They are driven for the sheer visceralpleasure of the experience.Part of that experience involves the two principalgauges on the dashboard: the speedometer and thetachometer: the former registering the car’sgroundspeed and the latter the revolutions-per-minute of the engine.Ferrari speedometers mock the driver, becausethey go all the way to 200mph; so at U.S.-legalfreeway limits of [usually] 65mph, the needle hardlymoved from rest.By contrast Maserati speedometers in the 1980swent to 195, Lotus’ went to 145, and the TC’s went to125. It wasn’t unusual to find an American car with adial maxing out at 85.American pushrod engines couldn’t spin as fastas European overhead-cams, so American tachstended to redline at about 4,500. The dual-OHCs ofthe Lotus and the TC reached 6,500, while Ferrariand Maserati spun to 8,700. The 328GTS actuallyhad a red “idiot light” between the speedo & the tachwhich, when illuminated, said “SLOW DOWN”. Irecall it was triggered by engine temperature as aresult of sustained tach redlining. I never saw minelight up, for the simple reason that I never slammedmy cars around. I preferred them to purrmelodiously, and I would have considered itunforgivably uncouth to slip a clutch.An ideal weekend drive from San Franciscomight start with a run southward along Skyline[index-119_1.jpg][index-119_2.jpg]- 119 -Boulevard (California #35) for breakfast at Alice’sRestaurant (where you can indeed get anything youwant, excepting Alice) above Woodside:Then cut down to the Coast Highway (California#1) through La Honda past Ken Kesey’s old place(site of Hells Angels revels and [almost] the Beatles),thence south on Coast Highway (California #1) pastsleepy Santa Cruz to touristed-up-but-still-funCannery Row in John Steinbeck’s Monterey.

Stopping for a picnic lunch in BigSur, they followed a dirt road up to an empty cabinon a bluff overlooking the Ocean. Struck by the view,they tracked down a local realtor and bought thecabin, but never returned to it.In 1947 they sold it to Bill & Lolly Fassett for$14K; the Fassetts moved into the cabin with theirfive children, and two years later opened therestaurant with its landmark views.Nepenthe (ancient Greek: νη π ενθές) firstappeared in Homer’s Odyssey as an Egyptian drugto cure sorrow through forgetfulness.

Men accustomed to being berated by wives orgirlfriends for any other “wasteful, frivolous,impractical, etc.” otherexotic purchase willencounter no objection whatever if they show up ina Jaguar.Exactly what causes this chemistry is elusive.Jags are elegant, comfortable, safe-feeling- 128 -substantial, prestigious, and just plain sexy. So aresome other cars in various price-ranges, but “there’sjust something girlmagnetic about Jaguars”.Whenever I reflect on this, I recall one day indowntown San Francisco, seeing a beautiful woman,presumably recently divorced, zoom by in a shinyJag XJS. The license plate: WASHISLilith is no exception. She has had 5 Jaguars overthe years: a bronze Vanden Plas I6 sedan, a darkmetallic “Solent Blue” XJS V12 coupé, a lightmetallic “Sapphire Blue” XJS V12, a metallic scarlet“Flamenco Red” XJS-AJI6, and a metallic blackXKR supercharged V8.This succession of XJSs wasn’t as excessive as itmight sound. The first one almost killed her: TheUnited States had just instituted its latest round ofcrazy laws about car-restraints, requiring front-seatshoulder/lap-belts to be self-applying. Presumablythe Safety Police suspected that too many peoplewere driving their cars without “buckling up”. SoJaguar’s initial smart solution to this consisted ofautomatic-motorized belts that would zip along atrack around the door when it was opened/closed.In practice this simulated the French Revolution’sguillotine. After a few narrow escapes with her headstill attached to her neck, Lilith took the Solent Bluekiller cat back to the St. Louis dealership andreturned with the next-generation Sapphire, whichmerely tut-tuts passengers with a buzz-alarm if anoccupied seat is not belted.The XJS was Jaguar’s sports-model throughoutthe 1980s and early 1990s. It had a hard act tofollow: the classically-beautiful XKE of the 1960s.In keeping with the automotive tradition ofstarting with a good idea and continuing to fuckwith it until you ruin it, Jaguar introduced the XKE- 129 -as a lean, lithe roadster whose bonnet swung up toreveal a jewel-polished twincam I-6. They flew offshowroom floors.A short time later the Washington Safety Policedecreed bumpers strong enough to permit drivingfull-tilt into a concrete wall. So the XKE sproutedatrociously-ugly front/rear amusement-parkbumper-car growths, destroying its superpenispresence.The deathblow came when the company, thrilledwith having invented the largest and heaviest V12 inthe industry, replaced the light/slim I6 with thishulk. They XKE was now both ugly and heavy, read“doomed”.Its successor was the XJS, a larger, strongercoupé designed for the V12. It was more of a GrandTouring than a Sports car, with a 3-speed automatictransmission and flying-buttresses behind the cabinthat looked as though they’d been copied from theNotre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Nevertheless it wascomfortable [in the non-amputee front seats],hushed as all V12s, solid as all Jaguars. Noteveryone’s cup of Earl Grey, but a satisfying ride ifone survived the guillotine safety-belts.If Jaguar fucked with the XKE until they got itwrong, they fucked with the XJS until they got itright. In its final 1993 year the big V12 was replacedby a completely-redesigned [hence “AJ16=AdvancedJaguar #1 [I]6”] DOHC I6, mated to an equally all-new 4-speed automatic. The bodywork had beensoftened and smoothed; the car was suddenlybeautiful instead of looking like a prop from aUniversal monster movie. Lilith’s Flamenco sprangthrough S.F. traffic like a ballet-dancer on tiptoe.- 130 -Of course for every Dr. Jekyll there is the otherguy, and for 1993 Jaguar imported 25 of him to thisside of the Pond as well: the JaguarSport XJR-S.Britain’s version of Carroll Shelby was a Scotnamed Tom Walkinshaw, who’d started out as a verysuccessful Formula One driver for Lotus, and hadgone on to distinguish himself at Le Mans and otherEuropean classic races. On the side he was a devoteeof Rugby, overseeing his own team of that intensivesport. So when Jaguar decided to Mr. Hyde itsimage a bit in the staid 1980s, it created a racingdivision called “JaguarSport” and brought Tom onboard to direct it - which he did, very successfully.Also as Ford did with Carroll Shelby, Jaguarcouldn’t resist asking their mad doctor to dosomething nasty to the XJS, which he did bysouping up the V12 to 335hp of violence, along withstructural & bodywork zip. The result was theJaguarSport XJR-S, which only made it to theUnited States for that same, final 1993 year. SanFrancisco didn’t get one, but San Jose did, so I tookthis big bad cat home to crouch next to Lilith’spretty kitty.Jaguar being Jaguar, the XJR-S was tarted-upeven more than usual, with the rarest and gnarliestburlwood dashboard & console, cut adjacently formirror-imaged gnarls. The leatherwork wasMaserati glove-s0ft. For the ultimate touch therewas a solid silver numbered nameplate, which alsoinformed you that it was engraved by Asprey byRoyal Warrant to the Prince of Wales. If you weren’timpressed by now, it wasn’t Coventry’s fault!In action the XJR-S was every bit as menacingand thundering as its crouched stance and rear-batwing promised. Once up to highway speed, itspassing authority was like a gunshot.- 131 -Did you notice that I said “once up to highwayspeed”? Therein lay the car’s Achilles’ heel. It seemsTom had forgotten about that ancient GeneralMotors 3-speed automatic: a throwback [as in“Throw it back in the Thames, Your Highness.”].Lilith’s twinkletoed AJ16/4-speed could easily beatthe mighty XJR-S across an intersection from a deadstop. A kid on a skateboard could. Only once up toits superhero torque-curve at 70mph or so was Mr.Hyde omnipotent. This would have been great fun ifI were inclined to leave CHP cruisers in the dust, butI didn’t think I could outrun an angry helicopter.Amusingly [as it wouldn’t have been were I not aveteran Lotus Esprit owner], the XJR-S’ radioantenna, like that of the Esprit, was directly in lineto be scythed in half by the rear wing if the bootwere opened. There was no engraved-silver platewarning against this.Throughout the 1980s Jaguar was strugglingfinancially to preserve its quality and image.Looking further ahead, neither its venerable I6 orequally not-exactly-state-of-the-art V12 promised tokeep up with ever-toughening American emissionstandards. Cat-astr0phe loomed - until Ford steppedin and bought Jaguar in 1989 for $2.3 billion. Thatwas a big gulp for Dearborn, but it wanted to addsome Olde World class to its act, not to mentionattracting the other half of the U.S. population.Indeed Ford had been eyeing Jaguar’s example asfar back as the mid-60s, when it called Mercury’supscale Mustang clone the Cougar and gave it anemblem close to the Jaguar “Growler” (heading thischapter), and gave it a luxury interior rich in leatherand [simulated] wood. The Cougar’s performance-model also had a name close to that of the XKE: theXR7.[index-132_1.jpg][index-132_2.jpg]- 132 -The immediate impact of the 1989 Ford takeoverwas a quantum jump in Jaguar manufacturingquality control, up to Ford standards. PreviouslyJaguar had had a less-than-reliable reputationdespite its cars’ beauty; now they became rock-solid.1993 was the last year for the XJS & XJR-S, aswell as existing line of sedans. Ford punted the twoold engines and did a few token modifications to oneof its small V8s, put “Jaguar V8” cam-covers on it,and announced it with great fanfare as Jag’sastounding new powerplant.An entirely new sports car would showcase it: the1996 XK8, a 2+2 for even smaller rear-seatamputees which recalled the swoopiness of the long-lamented XKEThe XK8 was still a solidly-bodied car, for whichits 290hp AJV8 was adequate but not spectacular.Two years later Jaguar bolted a blower onto theengine to give it 370hp, strengthened and loweredthe car accordingly, and named this optional modelthe XKR - which satisfied “Leadfoot Lil’s” occasionalwhim to blow the doors off anyone rash enough tochallenge her on Interstate #280.

The Allies didn’t know the source ofthe town’s name, so Wolfsburg continued to benamed after Hitler, with VW horn-buttons showinga wolf above a castle. 1960s’ hippies driving VWBugs & Buses hadn’t the faintest idea they werestaring at a heraldic image of Adolf Hitler standingon his castle ( Burg):- 135 -The Allies did notice the winged swastikasurrounding the hood-emblem (atop the first pageof this chapter) and righteously ordered it de-Nazified to the plain “VW” adorning the cars’exteriors thereafter.Hitler had also instructed Porsche to designsome practical troop-transport vehicles, and withina year Ferry had several prototypes ready. Theirofficial name was Kübelsitzwagen (“bucket-seatcar”) because, while doorless, they incorporatedrows of bucket-seats. This was soon abbreviated toKübelwagen, by which these vehicles were knownduring the War. 26These were not yet needed by the Wehrmacht,but in October 1934, after the end of India’smonsoon season, Heinrich Himmler’s archæologicalresearch office, the Ahnenerbe-SS, wanted severaloff-road vehicles for an expedition into the Sahyadrijungle of India, in an effort to locate a fabled cultcenter of the Buddhist deity Mara.Himmler’s mandate to the Ahnenerbe while itsteams had freedom of action in the prewar years wasto seek out not just evidence of Aryan racial ancestry& prehistory, but also unusual sources of power,natural or otherwise.The organization’s exploratory records, seized bythe U.S. Army following V-E Day, had beenmeticulously photographed for microfilm anddeposited in the National Archives Library inWashington, D.C. 27 Strangely, while accounts ofexpeditions to South America, Tibet, and Iceland are26 In the 1970s K-wagens enjoyed a cult-revival, and VWobligingly made some for the United States, calling themsimply “the Thing”.27 Microfilm rolls #120-211, Microcopy T-580 (10-135-4).[index-136_1.jpg][index-136_2.jpg]- 136 -included, all mention of the Indian venture isconspicuously absent. Correlative searches throughthe Ahnenerbe’s scholarly periodical publicationRunes, collected in the Library of Congress, suggestthat some disaster befell that project, because afterentering the jungle it was never heard from again.An apparently bombing-damaged box ofunpublished Runes manuscripts contained thefollowing fragment:MARA- by -René Emile Belloq, Ph.D.Assistant CuratorThe Louvre, Paris18th January 1933In Buddhism Mara is the lord ofmisfortune, sin, destruction and death.Mara is the ruler of desire and death,the two evils that chain man to thewheel of ceaseless rebirth. Mara revilesman, blinds him, guides him towardsensuous desires; once man is in hisbondage, Mara is free to destroy him.- 137 -Buddhist tradition holds thatBuddha encountered Mara on severaloccasions. When he abandoned thetraditional ascetic practices ofHinduism, Mara reproached him forstraying from the path of purity. Maralater reappeared as a Brahmin,criticising him for neglecting thetechniques of the yogins. At anothertime, Mara persuades householders in avillage to refuse to give alms to theBuddha. Mara also accuses Buddha ofsleeping too much, and not keeping busylike the villagers.In a famous incident similar to thetemptation of Jesus in the Christianreligion, Mara urges Buddha to become auniversal king and establish a greatempire in which men can live in peace.He reminds Buddha that he can turn theHimalayas into gold if he but wishes sothat all men will become rich. Buddhareplies that a single man’s wants are soinsatiable that even two such goldenmountains would fail to satisfy him.While Mara is unable to subjugateBuddha, he is more successful withBuddha’s followers, even approachingthe Buddha’s own brother, Ananda. Asthe source of evil, he causesmisunderstanding between teachers andpupils, casts doubt on the value ofBuddha’s sayings by calling themnothing but poetry, or encouragesmonks to waste their time on abstrusespeculations. Worse, he appears in the- 138 -guise of a monk, nun, relative, orprominent Brahmin, bringing false newsthat a disciple is destined to be a newBuddha. If the disciple succumbs to thetemptation, he will be filled with sinfulpride. Mara could even appear in theform of Gautama Buddha in order toconfuse Buddhists or lead them astray.Mara is lord of all men who arebound by sense desires. His origin,according to Theravada commentators,was as a rebellious prince who seizedcontrol of our world from the supremegod of the highest heaven. As prince ofthis world, Mara can boast of possessinggreat majesty and influence. Though hehas only a spirit body, he is endowedwith the five modes of sensual pleasure,has plenty to eat and drink, and lives toamuse himself.This may have been one of the documents thatprompted the Ahnenerbe expedition, but that isobviously speculative.What transpired after the Ahnenerbe expeditionmay be pieced together from the following collectionof correspondence, retrieved from the Departmentof Art History & Archæology of the University ofNorth Carolina, Chapel Hill. The “Indy” mentioned- 139 -is presumably the noted Professor Emeritus HarfordI. Jones, Ph.D. 28Further investigation leads to the University ofIndiana, which apparently sponsored and fundedJones’ effort to discover the facts concerning the ill-fated Ahnenerbe expedition.

It was soon forgotten in thecommotion of World War II and the subsequentdecolonization of India and Pakistan.In 1993, looking for a way to breathe some newlife into Disneyland’s Adventureland, DisneyImagineers began to search the globe for ideas.George Lucas, who a decade previously had setIndiana Jones & the Temple of Doom in India,recalled that his own Industrial Light & Magic,researching the proper atmosphere for a Kali-cult,had heard of, but not attempted to visit the nearly-forgotten Mara complex.It seemed to be the ideal solution: Just purchase,dismantle, transport, and reassemble the temple inDisneyland, much as Walt had done years previouslywith the bizarre Ambrose Gracey residence in NewOrleans, which was moved to Disneyland to becomeits famous “Haunted Mansion”. 30AT&T was coincidentally looking for a dramaticadvertisement, so was pleased to fund the massiveproject.The most difficult task was access to the originalsite, requiring not only new roadways to the coastbut careful defoliation of the structure withoutecological or æsthetic damage to the surroundingjungle. But eventually these problems were properlyresolved, and the entire temple taken to the port ofSan Pedro by container-ships. From there it wasoverland by truck to Anaheim, followed bypainstaking reassembly. By March 1995 the Temple30 The detailed account of this affair is contained in theauthor’s Ode to Esmé: Memoirs of Captain Nemo.- 146 -of Mara was in place a short distance through thejungle from the cruise-boats’ dock.LucasFilm’s & Disney’s original idea had been toreactivate Dr. Jones’ original, pleasant experience ofwonders and riches, viewed by Park guests from thecomfort of the fleet of Kübelwagens (which, still inworking order, had also been brought over).Most of the time this worked perfectly, withGuests enjoying the exotic atmosphere of thecenturies-old ruins, followed by a tranquil tour inone of the K-wagens to one of three beautifulchambers containing wondrous vistas and dazzlingartifacts.On rare occasions, however, someone in a K-wagen would forget or ignore Cast Members’emphatic instructions to under no circumstanceslook into the eyes of the Mara-statue that wasunfortunately integral with the temple’s stonesupports.When this occurred, the normally peaceful andpleasant K-wagen tour was suddenly wrenched intoa terrifying ordeal of fire, bugs, dæmonicapparitions, molten-rockfalls, and snakes. 31Even worse, careening through the old structurein a panic to attempt escape, Guests driving the K-wagens couldn’t help repeatedly hitting thestonework. The K-wagens were strong enough tosurvive such impacts, but exceptionally-unluckyriders, almost at a safe exit, might find to theirhorror that they had dislodged some of the largeststonework directly overhead.While such instructional disregards wereexceedingly rare, AT&T informed Disney & Lucasthat its shareholders would not stand for even31 Why’d there have to be snakes!?- 147 -occasional horrible deaths under the AT&T emblem.Fortunately the telephone company also had asolution: It tracked down the now-retired UNCprofessor and hired him to move to Anaheim andpersonally overwatch the rides to spot any carelessor accidental Guest-gawking at the statue. In suchcases Dr. Jones would attempt to personally guidethe now-endangered K-wagen to safety.While there were still some extremely close-calls,on the whole this solution worked. It certainly keptthe old archæologist’s retirement from being dull! 32At least the retaining of Dr. Jones by Disney &Lucas had one educational side-effect: When notattending to Mara-crises, he was able to completehis study of the Marabic inscriptions throughout thetemple. His summary of these findings - whichunfortunately most visitors to the temple bypassunawares - is included herein as Appendix #1.Readers seeking more information about HarryJones’ real-life background may wish to peruseSecret of the Lost Ark in the author’s FireForcebook.

Martin enjoyed racing their cars at nearbyAston Hill, and the name stuck: Aston Martin. 33In 1947 the little company was acquired byentrepreneur David Brown, who invested serious £sinto his famous series of “DB-” models, notablyupscale from most other British sports cars 0f the1950s-60s.When Ian Fleming wrote Goldfinger in 1959,Brown was offering his Mark III coupe, whichFleming mistakenly called a “D.B. III” in his novel:The car was from the pool. Bond had beenoffered the Aston Martin or a Jaguar 3.4. He hadtaken the D.B. III. Either of the cars would have33 When tractor-manufacturer David Brown bought AstonMartin in 1947, he also acquired the Lagonda name andmerged its line of luxury sedans with the sports-car firm, hencesubsequently/officially “Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd”.Occasional Lagondas would appear, but by the 1990s had beendiscontinued.- 151 -suited his cover - a well-to-do, rather adventurousyoung man with a taste for the good, the fast thingsof life - but the D.B. III had the advantage of an up-to-date triptyque, an inconspicuous colour -battleship grey - and certain extras which might ormight not come in handy. These included switches toalter the type and colour of Bond’s front and rearlights if he were following or being followed at night,reinforced steel bumpers fore and aft in case heneeded to ram, a long-barreled Colt .45 in a trickcompartment under the driver’s seat, a radio pick-uptuned to receive an apparatus called the Homer, andplenty of concealed space that would fox mostCustoms men. 34By the time Eon Productions had gotten roundto turning Goldfinger into the 1964 Sean Connerymovie, Aston Martin had progressed two models upto what was now the DB5. For its predecessor DB4Brown had incorporated a Superleggera body byItalian stylists to produce a stunningly-gracefulcoupé, whose boot was extended slightly for theperfectly-proportioned DB5. Eon asked Brown fortwo of them, which he was originally reluctant toprovide, fearing that the movie would degrade AstonMartin’s aristocratic image. Quite the other thinghappened: The Goldfinger DB5 appeared on-screenfor a total of only 13 minutes, but in that timebecame, and has since remained the most famouscar in the world. 35I should say cars, because there were actuallyfour of them:34 Fleming, Ian, Goldfinger. New York: Signet, 1959, page #53.35 As is adequately substantiated and documented by DaveWorrall in his The Most Famous Car in the World: TheComplete History of the James Bond Aston Martin DB5(Christchurch: Solo, 1993).[index-152_1.jpg][index-152_2.jpg]- 152 -DP 216/1 - the “Effects Car”DB5/1486/R - the “Road Car”DB5/2008/R - show carDB5/2017/R - show carThe Effects Car was the one originally fitted withall of the devices shown in the movie. It was usedonly for close-up scenes.In addition to being fitted with all of Fleming’sfeatures, Eon’s Effects Car added bulletproof glass, asteel shield rising up from the boot, twin frontmachine-guns, taillight-concealed dispensers of tire-destroying spikes and an oil slick, Ben-Hur-inspiredteeth projecting from the rear hubcaps, a moreelaborate “Homer” including a concealed radar-screen, and, as Q (above-right) noted, a passengerejector-seat.The Road Car was an unmodified DB5 used forall of the driving scenes in Goldfinger; it was alsothe car appearing briefly at the beginning ofThunderball, wherein it was fitted with twin rear-mounted water cannons.[index-153_1.png][index-153_2.jpg]- 153 -The two show-cars were not used in any movie.They were ordered by Eon with visual-displaydevices, and were shown in film-promotional toursas “the Bond car”.After Goldfinger [in the case of the Effects Car]and Thunderball [in the case of the others], thesecars were sold to private collectors. A few years laterthe Effects Car was stolen from a warehouse inFlorida and has never been found since.Like its 1965 Pontiac counterpart, the AstonMartin DB5 represented a never-before/never-sincezenith for the marque. The following DB6 wassupposed to be a step upward in quality andpracticality [one could almost actually sit in its backseat], but managed to “eject” its predecessor’s lithelooks with a bloated body finishing in a hugeducktail.Next up was the DBS driven by George Lazenby,who had the unenviable job of trying to replace SeanConnery as 007 in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.The DBS didn’t help; it was a horribly-Americanized- 154 -monster that could have been mistaken for a DodgeCharger. Neither Lazenby nor the DBS reBonded.Presumably on the premise that one bad ideadeserves to be followed by many more, Astonfollowed its Charger with a succession of ever-larger,-heavier, -cramped, -truckV8ed, -overpricedGodzillas throughout the 1970s-80s. Eon inflictedone of these on Timothy Dalton, otherwisemercifully provided Bond with a succession ofimaginative but tediously unconvincing rides:Toyota 2000GT, two Lotus Esprits, a Ford Mustang,and even, desperately, a Bimmer or two. When SeanConnery reprised himself in Never Say NeverAgain, at least he insisted on what Ian Flemingoriginally prescribed as Bond’s “locomotive”: abeautiful classic Bentley.By 1988, despite heroic efforts by its then-Chairman Victor Gauntlett, the legendary marque’sdays appeared 00-numbered. Gauntlett hadconcluded that Aston had “rather lost its way” afterthe DB6, and that only a “new DB4” could save it.Just coincidentally Henry Ford II was thenasking his friend Walter Hayes how to calm hisfinancial blood pressure after acquiring Jaguar for$2.5 billion.“Well,” smiled Hayes, “we could always buyAston Martin.” Yes, that sounded like secret-agentfun, so Henry dashed off the cheque for a much-less-perspirational £15 million.Carroll Shelby still thought he was nuts.Referring to Aston’s quaint factory at NewportPagnell, he told Ford, “All you’ve bought are twelveblacksmiths and an obsolete engine.”Hayes and Gauntlett set out to prove “Ol’ Snake”wrong. In the best American tradition, Ford liked touse common parts-bins, and with JaguarSports’- 155 -Tom Walkinshaw they’d just created the sultry XK8to supersede the aging XJS. The Walkinshaw worksat Bloxham could handle another production line, soan upscale XK8 was created, with a Maserati-poshinterior and Aston’s signature fishmouth grille andbonnet side-vents.Continuing to recapture the DB aura, Hayeswanted a twin-overhead-cam I6 engine, and foundjust the thing in the smaller brother of the Jag XJS’last engine, the AJ16. To give it Bond-pep, Gauntlettadded a supercharger. They were almost there; onlyone further essential was needed. They trackeddown the venerable David Brown, who wasdelighted to bless the car with his initials: DB7.When the DB7 appeared ca. 1996, it wasappreciated by the automotive press as “the mostbeautiful car in the world” - except by a few grouchyold purists, who sniffed at what they called the“XJ7”.At the height of their hideousness, the old V8Astons had impossible pricetags of multi-hundred-thousand $s. Although the DB7 cost a comparativelyeconomical $130K, that was still well out of myreach. At the time there was only one Astondealership in the Bay Area: Cole European inWalnut Creek. It was also a Jaguar cattery, andwhile having Lilith’s XKR serviced there, I’d dulyfantasized over the very-occasional othercar with thesilver wings on its nose.After awhile the sales manager apparently gottired of such shameless displays of adoration. “Mr.Cole is bored with his personal DB7, wants me tomove it. Interested?” The “move it” price was asamazing as the car: Cotswold Gold (a pale, metallicblush) with rich tan leather and brown piping,burled walnut accents, decadenthick rugs with[index-156_1.jpg][index-156_2.jpg]- 156 -embroidered wings. Under the bonnet was a plaqueattesting to the personally-assembled engine withthe “blacksmith’s” signature. Similar silver-engravedplaques on the door-bases took responsibility for thehand-crafted coachwork. Inside the embossedleather toolkit were suitably-gleaming instruments -and [O.K., that does it!] a pair of white gloves!There weren’t very many of these jewels on theroad in California at the time, so I had no trouble inobtaining personalized license plate DB007. Yes,shameless.1998 was the last year for the I6 DB7 in theUnited States; emissions requirements and all that.Ford was undaunted. It took two Duratec V6s andglued them together, adding “Aston Martin V12”cam-covers. A nice, quiet, silky V12 henceforth, butit was the snarl of that blown-6 that recapturedGoldfinger; it had taken me only 35 years.The other icon of that movie - besides PussyGalore, I mean - was the United States BullionDepository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, which sits alonein an open expanse at the end of Gold Vault Roadjust past its intersection with Bullion Boulevard.- 157 -If you thought the movie took you up to andinside it, nope. There are few places in the worldmore unwelcoming to visitors than the Depository,and that included Eon. It was forced to build its ownduplicate at England’s Pinewood Studios, which alsodoubled as Auric Goldfinger’s Swiss factory.In the late 1960s, if an uninvited sightseer turnedfrom Bullion Boulevard onto the Gold Vault Roaddriveway leading to the Depository, a loudspeakerwould instruct him to stop/turn around/leave. 36Tres disconcerting [and not a little embarrassing] to2nd Lt. Aquino when assigned to Knox in 1968 forthe Armor Officer Basic Course. But so stringent wasthe Treasury Department that no one not on officialbusiness could enter, including such aristocracy asGenerals, Admirals, Senators, Sean Connery, HonorBlackman, and Gert “Goldfinger” Frobe, even if hepromised not to try to blow it up again.Ah, but the Fates were weaving something fun intheir tapestry:Upon returning from southeast Asia in 1970,now-Captain Aquino was assigned to the ArmorSchool Faculty. Along with this came the usual mixof additional duties; my academic background gotme tasked to update the official histories of Armorand Cavalry for the post’s Patton Museum. I spentmany evenings combing through two centuries oforiginal records, orders, letters - some of which,such as the 19th-Century Indian Wars’, were cold-bloodedly shocking beyond anything Hollywooddepicted.However this project eventually brought me tothe attention of the School’s academic head,36 I understand that post-9/11 rebuffs and barriers aresignificantly more ominous, to include camera-confiscationshould you be noticed taking even a distance-photograph.[index-158_1.jpg][index-158_2.jpg][index-158_3.jpg][index-158_4.jpg]- 158 -Assistant Commandant General George S. Patton.No, not a ghost, but close enough: the 1-star son ofWorld War II’s 4-star “Old Blood and Guts”.As it happens, my father, Cavalry SergeantMichael Aquino Sr., had served with the WW2Patton in his Third Army as it swept across Franceinto Germany. His son was already his own legend,decorated with two of the United States’ second-highest medals for valor, the Distinguished ServiceCross. 37In addition to his School responsibilities, theGeneral was in constant demand for publicappearances, and a PSYOP officer on his staffaccordingly came in handy as a speechwriter. Not assimple as it sounds: I had to project the famousOB&G electricity while carefully staying within theboundaries of gentlemanly good taste.37 After prior combat service in Korea, Patton also received thePurple Heart for serious wounds on his third tour in Vietnam.These eventually forced his retirement as a Major General in1980, and ultimately sent him to meet his father at Fiddler’sGreen in 2004.- 159 -When not in his expected superhero character,the General was a Renaissance Man of exceptionaldignity, courtesy, and sensitivity. Like his father hewas passionately patriotic, as well as constantlyconcerned for those under his command.Thus he was not at all pleased with the George C.Scott portrayal of his father as a callous, coarseegomaniac. Nothing, he insisted, could be fartherfrom the truth: Again the elder Patton had adoptedan aggressive persona for his soldiers’ and theAmerican public’s morale - but he worked tirelesslynever to endanger his troops needlessly.In 1972 the United States was clearly extricatingitself from a very unsatisfactory southeast Asianwar. The Combat Arms of the Army - Infantry,Armor, & Artillery - were very dangerous branchesfor new officers to choose, and one day Pattonreturned from a visit to the Infantry School at FortBenning, Georgia, brandishing a copy of a bookletbeing distributed to West Point and ROTC campusesextolling Infantry as a career-choice. I could see thathis house PSYOP officer was about to be volunteeredon behalf of Armor/Cavalry.I cracked my Fort Bragg knuckles and saluted. Ashort time later Armor had a booklet far zestier thanInfantry’s - full-color, overflowing with maps, units,photographs, and personal welcomes by all the BigBrass. Unfortunately once again I had done toomuch of a good job. “Before you sit down, Captain,how about doing another one for enlisted careers?”Another month, another bursting-at-the-seamscelebration of M60A1 Main Battle Tanks, AirCavalry HueyCobra helicopters, and ground CavalrySheridans (parachutable, amphibious tanks rathermore fun than the big M60s because their main gunfired the Shillelagh guided missile).[index-160_1.jpg][index-160_2.jpg][index-160_3.jpg][index-160_4.jpg]- 160 -I put the Sheridan on the cover of the enlistedbooklet. In case officer cadets were tempted to standin front of one to see what it would be like to have aShillelagh fired at you, I obliged on the front cover ofthe officer booklet. 38And that’s how the Armor & Cavalry Branches ofthe U.S. Army were not wanting for new officers andenlisted troopers even during the waning years ofthe Vietnam War. Or so the Oak Leaf Cluster thatappeared on my Army Commendation Medal shortlythereafter seemed to indicate.But what does all this have to do with AstonMartins and Goldfinger? Just that the next“additional duty” I was assigned was, somewhat tomy consternation, to update the land-defense plansfor Fort Knox.38 New 2nd Lieutenants & Ensigns aren’t usually noted forbeing particularly bright. Yes, that black thing in the middle ofthat pretty rocket-exhaust fire headed directly for your nose isthe Shillelagh guided missile. ’Bye!- 161 -These date back to 1918, when the Army hadconsolidated a number of Field Artilleryinstallations in Kentucky into the new Camp Knox. Igather that there was some uncertainty aboutwhether Kaiser Wilhelm II would knock out theBritish and French, then chase General Pershingback across the Atlantic to Kentucky before he couldmake an Alamo-like Last Stand here.In the best bureaucratic tradition, these planswere not scrapped with the defeat of the Hun.Rather they were carefully maintained andperiodically revised. Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojodidn’t make it to Kentucky either, but in 1972 therewas still the Warsaw Pact from Europe and Maofrom Asia. Fort Knox was not going to be caughtunprepared!One of the United States’ interests, I discovered,was that Enemy Hoards not rip off what in 1937 hadbeen about $13 billion in gold bars. Especialattention was therefore to be devoted to defense ofthe Depository. Which meant that the planningofficer had to personally inspect it. Cool!I didn’t need to gas anyone, dynamite the electricfence, or cut open the steel doors with a laser. I juststated my business to the loudspeaker and wasquickly and cooperatively escorted throughout thecomplex and the Depository’s two stories &basement-level.I was a bit disappointed to discover that thebuilding’s interior looked nothing like the dazzlinggolden display of Goldfinger. It was a quiteordinary, indeed dull collection of storage rooms fullof neatly-stacked gold bricks. These were generallynever moved or touched during inventories, both toprevent any abrasion to the relatively soft gold and[index-162_1.jpg][index-162_2.png]- 162 -also because, as I was allowed to experience, theywere surprisingly heavy.James Bond crashed his DB5 into a wall of AuricGoldfinger’s Swiss factory (actually the back lot ofPinewood Studios in England) instead of driving itup Gold Vault Road, and my DB7 never made theGolden Pilgrimage either; all these events happenedin 1972, when I was zipping around Fort Knox in theLotus Elan +2S of Chapter #3.As for that gorgeous DB7, it wasn’t crashedeither. Rather, in the occasional whimsy of exoticcar dealerships, Cole European decided in 2005 todrop its Aston Martin franchise, which meant that atthe turn of the century the nearest service point forthe car was Beverly Hills to the south, Portland tothe north, and Salt Lake City to the east. Asmaintenance commutes go, these would have been abit excessive, so I drove down to Ferrari Los Gatos tosee if they had anything interesting on their lot.[index-163_1.jpg]- 163 -- 164 -[index-165_1.png][index-165_2.jpg][index-165_3.jpg]- 165 -16: 2001 Dodge Viper GTS2005-2006They’re coming to take me away, hoho, heehee, haha,To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time,And I’ll be happy to see those nice young men in theirclean white coats.And they’re coming to take me awaaay ...- Napoleon XIVThey’re Coming to Take Me Away (1966)Arguably all of the cars throughout this“automobiography” are eccentricities, fetishes,adventures into the unusual and exotic. But in eachcase there is also an appreciation for unique artistry,- 166 -much as one might view or collect rare and beautifulworks of art, wines, music, etc.I’d have to push the envelope pretty far, however,to find some æsthetic justification for the Viper. It’srather a bald descent into madness, with no excuseseither attemptable or believable. Some cars you buywith your head. Some you buy with your heart. Youhave to go a bit further down the body in the case ofthe Viper.Los Gatos is a chic little backwater of San Jose,about 60 miles south of San Francisco. It’swhimsically named after two massive stone catstatures guarding the entrance to an estate offCalifornia #17, the deadly racetrack that winds overthe hills to Santa Cruz. What passes for its “businessdistrict” is a sleepy shopping street about threeblocks long. On one of those in 2005 nestled Ferrariof Los Gatos - the only such dealership in SiliconValley. Like most such enterprises, it survived moreon used toys than new ones. Its small showroom wasdwarfed by its backlot, in which one never knewwhat one would find: older classic Ferraris,Maseratis, Lamborghinis; Loti, Cobras, Bugattis,perhaps a Mercedes 300SL gullwing or a Morganwith leather straps holding its bonnet closed.But today, despite all the flash and flamboyance,one thing insolently relegated the rest to also-viewed: a Midnight Blue Metallic Dodge Viper GTScoupé. Unexpectedly, perhaps as a contemptuousgesture to show that it qualified to park amidst suchaugust old-school machinery, this Viper also boastedthe Connolly Leather interior option, in a deepCognac hue: an altogether mysterious andincongruous factory offering.This hulking monster instantly evoked theBatmobile of the resurgent Batman films - you- 167 -know, the ones in which Batman is a bit of a psychohimself and therefore needs appropriate wheels.The Dodge Viper has a similarly-sinister history.After Carroll Shelby had a falling-out with Ford inthe early 1970s. Seeing his kick-ass 1965 MustangGT-350 gradually de-assed, luxurified, and bloatedinto what he disavowed as a “boulevard cruiser”, Ol’Snake was wooed by fellow-departee Lee Iacocca,who wanted him to whip up something vicious forChrysler as he had the Cobra for Ford.Ford now owned the “Cobra” name, so what nowsat up on Dr. Frankenstein’s operating table wascalled the Viper, and assigned to the Dodge divisionof the corporation. I suppose it was a bit too brawnyfor the more dignified Chrysler Division, which atthat time was flirting with the Maserati TC ofChapter #11.The other “11” pertinent to the Viper was itsappetite in miles-per-gallon. There was nothingexotic or high-tech about its engine: a massivepushrod V10 flexing 46ohp at just about anywhereon the tachometer you cared to stomp the go-pedal.The MoPar exhaust system more or less emulatedthe re-entry tiles on the Space Shuttle, making itessential not to allow your ankle to touch the doorsill on exit. This extremism was duplicated at theintake, as the coolant-temp gauge quickly went tothe redline just below “overheat” and stayed lockedthere, regardless of weather or traffic conditions.Driving this thing was like sitting inside a bomb thatmight or might not explode at any moment.Sandwiched between the twin-furnaces of the intake& exhaust, the driver just kept the A/C on “Max” andprayed for the luck of Dirty Harry’s client facing thebusiness end of that .44 Magnum.[index-168_1.jpg][index-168_2.jpg]- 168 -But of course all these alarmisms evaporated inthe thrill of launching this road-rocket. In thetradition of the Goat of Chapter #4, it didn’t likecurves, but in a straight line it was the proverbialIrresistible Force. Official 0-60mph time was 3.5seconds, about a second quicker than the Goat’s.You may not think that 1 second makes much of adifference; trust me - it does. Sort of like testingwhether Albert’s idea that everything compresses tonothing at the speed of light is scientifically valid.Arriving somewhere in the Viper definitely madea statement, but I was never quite sure what. I thinkit was the only vehicle with four wheels that theHells Angels Frisco would tolerate parked in front oftheir clubhouse, and at Paul Kantner’s Sea Cliff digsit stirred old memories of his purple Porsche back inthe 1960s. That was shortly after one of El Caminodel Mar’s gaping sinkholes had [de]materialized toexcite that otherwise-superpricey neighborhood ofSan Francisco, and recalls one of my more ominousvisits to Anton & Diane LaVey’s house at nearby6114 California Street back in the early 1970s.[index-169_1.jpg][index-169_2.jpg][index-169_3.jpg][index-169_4.jpg]- 169 -I’ve given a descriptive & photographic tour of6114 - the original “Central Grotto” - in my TheChurch of Satan. It was a three-story building withthe 2nd as its main floor, a streetside-stair leading tothe front door. Thus the ground floor served as agarage for the LaVeys’ sky-blue 4.2 Jaguar sedan infront, the “Den of Iniquity” bar immediately behindit, the “Blue Room” (a kaleidoscopic mirrormaze)behind the Den, and the building’s innermost-sanctum, the “Council Chamber” to the right of thegarage.What almost no one knew was that off the Den,between the Council Chamber and the Blue Room,concealed behind a door appearing to be part of theDen’s wall, was a secret alcove, containing a smallprivate office for Anton [in addition to his better-known one beneath the ceiling-bed in the mainfloor’s Red Room]. It was also from this small alcovethat a ladder led to the fireplace in the Purple Room(the main floor social/audience room), which couldthus permit the Devil’s High Priest to make asuitably “Hellfiery” entrance when greeting astartled reporter.[index-170_1.jpg][index-170_2.jpg]- 170 -But that wasn’t the creepiest thing about thatalcove. One evening Anton and I had beendiscussing H.P. Lovecraft’s novel The Case ofCharles Dexter Ward, notable for an ordinary NewEngland farmhouse concealing a warren ofunderground tunnels and caverns with the usualHPL horrors lurking therein.“How much do you know about this part of SanFrancisco?” asked my host, then led the way fromthe Purple Room through the bookcase to the RedRoom, thence into the Tutankhamun mummycaseconcealing the “normal” ladder down into the Den ofIniquity. Anton unlocked the alcove door, and wewent inside, where he pulled up the throw-rug onthe cement-slab floor, revealing an obviously veryold iron manhole-cover.Without touching it, Anton replaced the rug.He’d inherited 6114 from his parents, he said, andhis father had shown him this feature in whatoriginally was just unfinished basement crawlspace.Young Tony had been told just to leave it alone,which he did.[index-171_1.png][index-171_2.png]- 171 -Years later, when remodeling the house to itspresent exotica, he’d come across it again whileconstructing the Purple Room’s fireplace-ladder. Heopened it, revealing a vertical tunnel of utterdarkness beneath. There was no ladder or theremains of one, and a flashlight beam was not strongenough to illuminate its lower terminus. Hereplaced the iron lid and hadn’t disturbed it since.From a drawer of the alcove’s desk, Antonretrieved a document. Back in the Purple Room hespread it out on the tombstone-coffeetable.“This is the storm-drain network beneath theRichmond District, Sea Cliff, and Land’s End. Afterthe 1906 Earthquake & Fire, there was a great dealof engineering effort put into the city’s water-supply& -drainage systems. Apparently the old NorthBeach & Financial Districts just needed repairs totheir existing networks, but out in the Avenues,Sunset, & Richmond there was major excavation.[index-172_1.png][index-172_2.png]- 172 -“As best I can determine from these old charts,6114’s sitting slightly off-center above the mainstorm-drain artery, a gigantic spillway called the‘Mile Rock Tunnel’. It’s about 300 feet down andseveral thousand feet long, ending in the Land’s Endcrags below the Sutro Baths. A great manytributaries, both official and unofficial, wereconnected to Mile Rock. This entire district is sittingover an underground labyrinth that would putLovecraft to shame. I think it’s obvious that the pitbelow this house is one of those extensions, if notpart of Mile Rock itself. Here’s an old photo of itbefore it was sealed off from sight:“Collapsing branchlines explain the giganticsinkholes that plague this district. Judging from thebewilderment at such times, I don’t think anyonebut myself knows the existence or extent of theabandoned subterra, else they’d be terrified to live- 173 -here. And it also lays bare the blighted devastationhaunting the ruins of the Sutro Baths.” 39Anton paused, pulled a moldering tome from thebookshelf covering the entrance to the Red Room. Isaw with a thrill of horror that it was indeed thedread Necronomicon of the mad Arab AbdulAlhazred. Undeterred, indeed apparently driven bysome subtle madness emanating from the iron-sealed chasm below us, Anton pawed through thedisintegrating pages, then intoned in a voicealternately maniacally triumphant and quaveringlyhysterical:“The nethermost caverns are not for thefathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels arestrange and terrific.“Cursed the ground where dead thoughts livenew and oddly bodied, and evil the mind that is heldby no head.“Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is thetomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy thetown at night whose wizards are all ashes.

The highways out there were full ofperformance-cars, but The One That Started It All -the Pontiac GTO - was nowhere to be found. 41It was no longer possible to recreate the originalformula: just stuffing an overpowered engine intoPontiac’s smallest coupé. It had been a pretty dumbthing to do even back in 1964, and 2004 safetystandards wouldn’t hear of it. What to do?Bob Lutz, who had become head of Pontiac in2001, found the answer surrounded by kangaroosand koala-bears: General Motors’ Australian branch,Holden. Word reached him of a new model calledthe Monaro, which was causing something of asensation Down Under. So he went down to see forhimself, and brought it Up Above for a three-yearAmerican run as the 2004-6 Pontiac GTO.Old Goatherds weren’t sure what to think. Imean, the original GTO had been quintessentially“Detroit Iron”, and even if this new kid onna blockwas GM, it was still, you know, an import.

Everything aboutit was top-quality: premium leather seats,instrumentation, and the entire powertrain. Despiteits being far heavier than its predecessor, its 400hp/400fpt DOHC LS2 V8, matched to the same Tremectransmission used by BMW for its M-series street-racers, blasted it to 60mph in a tidy 4 seconds flat(1/2sec quicker than the original).The new GTO also came fully-loaded; the onlyoption was a slightly-larger set of wheels. A dealer-installed “appearance” package was also available ifyou wanted the car to look a bit meaner.Which of course I did, when my midlife-crisishormones lashed me to Ellis Brooks’ Pontiac in SanFrancisco for a 2006 in Grey Metallic, 6-speedmanual [natch!], red-dial instruments, 16” wheels.The only thing to complain about, as one mightsurmise from the above, is that the new GTO wastoo perfect.

It lies 208 miles southwest ofAlice Springs.According to native legend:The Earth was once a featureless place. None ofthe lands or seas we know existed until creator beings,in the forms of humans, plants, and animals, traveledwidely around the world. Then, in a process of creationand destruction, they formed the Earth as we know ittoday. The Aṉangu land is still inhabited by the spiritsof these ancestral creator beings, which are known asTjukuritja or Waparitja. 43And far from being just a solid, inert clump ofsandstone, native sages know Uluru to contain awarren of tunnels and fabulous chambers, teaming43 “The Creation Period”, Department of the Environment,Water, Heritage and the Arts, Commonwealth of Australia.[index-181_1.jpg]- 181 -with puzzling power-nucleii and eerie entitiesseeking to acquire or retain control of them:Many Tjukurpa, such as Kalaya (emus), Liru(poisonous snakes), Lungkata (blue-tongue lizards),Luunpa (kingfishers), and Tjintir-tjintirpa (willie-wagtails) constantly frolic and fight not just withinUluru itself, but throughout Uluru-Kata TjutaNational Park, though other Tjukurpa seemconcentrated in specific enclaves. 44Obviously even the human members of the Parkadministration are not enthusiastic about outsidersblundering about within the Rock.

The themes of its songs [andfirst six albums] were those of the late 1960s: love,political protest, and psychedelic fantasia.In 1970 a new album appeared. Bearing PaulKantner’s name and “Jefferson Starship” (ratherthan “Airplane”), it was called Blows Against theEmpire. Kantner’s compositions, arranged in a loosesequence, told the story of a group of youngcounterculture Americans, increasingly alienatedand frustrated by the climate of the Johnson/Nixonera, who ultimately decided to hijack an orbitingstarship just constructed by the government and gostreaking off into the cosmos en route to theAndromeda Galaxy.At the end of the accompanying libretto bookletwas a proclamation:We intend to hijack the first sound interstellar orinterplanetary starship built by the people of thisplanet.

The onlyoperational spacefleet at that time consisted of- 184 -TWA’s five Moonliners45, which the airline hadretrieved from Disneyland’s spaceport in 1962 - twoyears after Howard Hughes, who had personallyinitiated and funded their design and operation, hadrelinquished his control of the airline.Three of the Moonliners had since been stored atthe TWA corporate headquarters facilities in KansasCity, while the other two (ML-2 & ML-5) had beenlent to NASA for oversight and backup of itsMercury, Gemini, & Apollo programs. After the lastApollo mission - #17 in 1972 - NASA launched nomore manned craft until the first Space Shuttleflight in 1981. NASA retained the two Moonliners inservice for contingencies, but did not have occasionto launch either of them. After the initial Shuttleflights were deemed reliable, the two Moonlinerswere finally returned to TWA in 1983. The entirefleet was then mothballed until TWA’s dissolution in2006. The subsequent disposition of the Moonlinerfleet is unknown.In 1970, therefore, NASA reasoned that if PaulKantner were to attempt to seize a spaceship, itwould be one of the Agency’s two operationalMoonliners. One was hangered at Cape Kennedy inFlorida, the other at Vandenberg Air Force Base inCalifornia. The latter’s proximity to San Franciscomade it the more likely candidate for a hijack, sosecurity was quietly but significantly increased.Obviously the Moonliner couldn’t accommodate7,000 hippies, but its passenger cabin had plenty ofroom for a dance party of 100 or so, plus a band.With that limitation, it would do just fine as aJefferson Starship starship.45 Cf.

It seemsthat he’d acquired and enjoyed Blows Against theEmpire, and he had a bit of a “rebellious” streak inhis own character. Might as well sign out with awhoopie cushion on the chair of the stuffed shirts.So he placed a phone call to his old employee andfriend Patrick J. Collins, now about to retire as asenior vice president of TWA, with a personalrequest. 46 Collins agreed, gave some orders to hisstaff, then called Paul Kantner in San Francisco.Thus on March 14, 1977 the Jefferson Starshipand 100 specially-invited friends47 lifted off in46 Yes, this was the same “P.J. Collins” who as a TWA Captainhad piloted my own Moonflight from Disneyland back in 1955;cf. the signed certificate in Chapter #4.47 When I learned of this years later from the DIA MSIC file atUSSPACECOM, I asked Paul why Lilith and I hadn’t beeninvited. “Because if you’d known about it, you’d have had toblow the whistle to NASA or kiss your Clearance goodbye.” Hehad a point.

A flurry of “red-telephone”conversations dispelled this concern, though hardlyreassuring Moscow that Washington had its rocketsunder control.To ensure that his parting shot wouldn’t bemissed, Hughes further asked Collins to land notback in Kansas City, but at the still-extentDisneyland spaceport:Tomorrowland visitors scattered as the rockettouched smoothly down on its old pad, butdelightedly assumed it was a nostalgic surprisestaged by Disney.

But Hughes was now dead,and the new President, Jimmy Carter, told theAgency to forget it and get busy on the Shuttleproject. Rosalynn Carter later said in her memoirsthat she’d never seen Jimmy laugh so hard - oncehe’d calmed down an agitated Alexei Kosygin.As much fun as the Moonflight had been for PaulKantner, it had also sobered him as to the dauntinglogistics of vehicular spaceflight. Unlike Star Trek,Battlestar Galactica, & Star Wars, humans can’tjust hop on a starship and go galavanting off acrossthe cosmos without painstakingly complex life-support mechanisms and provisions. The TWAMoonliners, as serviceable as they might be, werejust short-range encapsulations tied to Earthdepartures and returns.This realization shifted Paul’s attention awayfrom physical space vessels to the capabilities andpotentialities of consciousness: “altered states” as itwere. Themes of dreams and visions proliferated inhis extraterrestrial music. What might I suggest?I scarcely need emphasize that neither of us hadmotives the least nefarious. Paul simply wanted totake the experience of music sensation to a new levelof intensity, while I was seeking a key to reduce, ifnot eliminate irrational hatreds and violence ininternational conflicts & crises.What particularly interest us were influences onconsciousness from outer space. No, not lunatic-fringe “close-encounters”, but rather very real,scientifically-measurable electromagnetic spectralactivity, such as he suspected to exist at two of hisinvestigated locales: Mount Shasta and Ayres Rock.[index-189_1.jpg][index-189_2.png]- 189 -Like Uluru, Shasta has a long and colorfulreputation for weirdness. 49 As Paul later illustratedin “Lilith’s Song”, “She is a Telepath”, & “MountShasta” on Planet Earth Rock & Roll Orchestra(1983), he’d asked Grace Slick to check themountain out, and she’d returned from the cavernsbelow Panther Meadow with what H.P. Lovecraftwould call “exceedingly singular sensations”.My research into this came from two unusualsources: the records of the Ahnenerbe-SS in the U.S.National Archives and those of the four ultrasecretKGB laboratories under the control of themysterious psychiatrist Dr. Dmitry G. Mirza, withthe charming nominal title of “Director of theResearch Division of the National Center forTraditional Folk Medicine”.

Since thepublication of Ostrander & Schroeder’s PsychicDiscoveries Behind the Iron Curtain in 1970, therehadn’t been much fresh material, so Mike decided toinvestigate for himself. He made numerous trips tothe Soviet Union, and caricatured Mirza as50 Randi, James, Flim-Flam!: Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, &Other Delusions.

The Atlanteans came to understand that thehuman brain is an electrochemical machine which isfar more affected by the EMS than our present-dayscience realizes. Today we know of the four principalbrainwave frequencies: alpha, beta, theta, and delta.These reflect one’s mental condition, alertness, andmood. Hence alpha is emitted by a relaxed, friendly,positive, open mind. Delta characterizes sleep,dullness, exhaustion. Beta signals nervousness, fear,concentration, intense strain. Theta is extremelypeculiar and elusive; I’ll save its discussion foranother time.In complete EMS insulation, were this possible,these would just indicate each brain’s discretecondition and activity. The Atlanteans furtherrecognized, however, that each human brain issensitive and subject to external, more powerfulEMS radiation in these frequencies. Per the principle52 Murphy, Michael, An End to Ordinary History. Los Angeles:J.P. Tarcher [distributed by Houghton Mifflin], 1982.53 Murphy, Michael, Jacob Atabet. Millbrae: Celectial Arts,1977.54 Cf. Kripal, Jeffrey J., Esalen: America & the Religion of NoReligion. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007.- 192 -of resonance, it seeks to align itself with them, all ofwhich occurs at the subconscious level. Humanscannot hear or otherwise sense these subsonicswithout instruments.T h e A h n e n e r b e h a s a l r e a d y b e g u nexperimenting with such technology. Imagine beingable to simply send an attacking army to sleep on abattlefield without firing a shot, for instance.However it is not quite as simple as creating adelta-gun and pointing it at an antagonist. Thesewaves are generally omnidirectional and difficult toshield against. You might send your enemy to sleep,but you’d be sleeping right next to him as well.What the Atlanteans further understood wasthat the Earth itself is a natural, and extremelypowerful, EMS generator. All of the planet’s naturalforces are subject to its EMS fields, including all lifeforms, continuously and where humans areconcerned, mostly unconsciously. And I haven’t eventouched upon the area of extraterrestrial EMS,which Atlantis found to be an even more vast andcomplex area of influence.In examining the Earth’s EMS, the Atlanteanswere able to calculate and map various paths, andstrong and weak areas of radiation related to them.In our own era, you may have heard of somethingcalled ‘Ley Lines’ - a term used by an amateur Britisharchæologist in 1921 to describe presumed naturaland artificial alignments in landforms and humanstructures with imagined ‘Earth forces’. He wasunaware of the EMS field phenomena detected bythe Atlanteans, but intuitively he came closer toactuality than he could imagine.To put it most simply, there are intersectionsbetween Earth’s EMS fields and those of the Sun -from the small to the large, from the instantaneousto the continuous. The Atlanteans were well on theirway to completing detailed calculations and maps ofthese, with a view not just to prediction but to beutilized in augmenting artificial generations by theirscientists. Thus they thought to magnify fairly small,artificial generations to widespread, even planetaryimpact.As we continued to decipher the Atlantean EMSmaps, we were fascinated to discover how many ofEarth’s natural and artificial features relate to them.- 193 -Thus, for example, the placement of Stonehenge inEngland, and the importance attributed to theExternsteine in our own country are not merelyimaginative: these and various other structures ofnote happen to be positioned almost precisely onone of these field-intersection portals. This can serveboth passively and actively, although in our owncivilizations it appears humans knew and used onlythe passive functions. Thanks to the Atlantean maps,the Ahnenerbe is now developing the capacity to usethe more basic active options ... 55Thus the altered states of consciousness thatGrace Slick experienced in the caves of MountShasta, and Paul’s own experiences in the “Chamberof Secrets” within Uluru, were activated by just suchEarth/Solar Portals, as is the North Tower of theWewelsburg, the Moon Rock of Nan Madol56, etc.Like the Atlanteans, the Australian Aborigineshad, at least for the locale of the Rock, calculated theconjunctions that opened the Uluru Portal,recording them in the stellar map chamber andproviding the aligned ceiling-tunnel in anotherchamber to precisely identify each occurrence.But in the early 1980s neither Paul nor I fullyunderstood the implications of the Portals, norwould have dared to activate them if we had. He wasinterested in the much more modest - and safe - goalof alpha-resonating audiences’ brainwaves tomaximize relaxation and pleasure.Hence the concept behind the real “Fred”-devicewas to generate infrasonic (inaudible) wavessynchronous with the audible music, both amplified55 Aquino, Michael A., We Break the Sword.

If he did,the PERRO recording may well have been its “testflight”; but one would need an infrasonics detectorto determine that.

On theother hand, switching the V8V’s suspension from“comfort” to “competition” not only stiffens theshock absorbers but opens an exhaust valve beforethe “silencer” (BE muffler) to change the Aston’spurr to a more 007ish roar.My ex-demo car had been ordered with almostevery option except the fire-extinguisher bolted tothe floor by the passenger seat, and [thankfully!] thegarish red or yellow brake calipers that some ownersinflict to outrage their cars’ multicoat paintperfection. Along with Casino Royale one couldorder his Aston in “Casino Royale” (a metallic greywith kaleidoscopic miniglitter). With the next film,Quantum of Solace, an auburn metallic called“Quantum Silver” was available. Since the originalDB5 reappeared in Skyfall, Aston brought back its1964 colour of “Silver Birch”. Such-ordered carsquickly became collectors’ darlings.The V8V was also significantly shorter than itsDB9, DBS, & One-77 brethren, which made it asusable within cramped San Francisco as “Sonny” mywhite Testarossa had not been. Some owners ofexotic cars refuse to mar their looks with uglylicense-plate holders. Added to the V8V, these cheapplastic devices conveniently protected the expensive[index-207_1.jpg][index-207_2.jpg]- 207 -bumpers from San Francisco’s epidemic “impactparkers”.The traffic-jams and parking-crunch in Londonare even worse than in San Francisco. V8Vs mightbarely endure this, but bringing a full-size DB9 orDBS into the city is an ordeal of futility &frustration.To address this, Aston came up with whatseemed to be a sensible idea: a “city car” ultra-compact, inexpensive enough to be a second-car, oreven a taste of Silver Wings for those daunted byhigh window-stickers.Aston Martin is a small company without theresources for multiple model development, so theidea was to start with someone else’s car and“Aston” it. The chosen subject was the Toyota Scion.Since AM intended to remake this ugly ducklinginto a swan, the name given to the project was“Cygnet”. To morph into a C, a S got premium paint,a body kit including the signature AM grille & side-vents, and a complete interior leather makeover.The engine & suspension were re-tuned to give the C[index-208_1.jpg][index-208_2.jpg][index-208_3.jpg][index-208_4.jpg]- 208 -more of a sports-car feel. On the whole the entireoperation came out rather nicely:Except for an entire nation of AM-purists whoimmediately went ballistic over such a flagrantsacrilege to the divine marque’s virgin sanctity. AToyotaston! What bloody cheek! It even has thesacred Silver Wings on its blasphemous bonnet!Even its price - below $50K - was unconscionable,shudderingly bringing Aston Martin within wallet-reach of - the Great Unwashed!So the Cygnet vanished from Aston’s lineupforthwith. Pity: I thought it was a very cute car - andarguably more sensible & practical than the rest ofthe pantheon. Possibly that’s exactly why it wasunwelcome.In addition to exclusive, themed watches, exoticcars usually come with owners’ clubs: intricateorganizations from the local to the worldwide. Atappropriate times I was a member of Lotus Ltd,Golden Gate Goats, Maserati Club, Ferrari Club ofAmerica, Jaguar Associate Group (JAG), ShelbyAmerican Automobile Club (SAAC), TC America, &Aston Martin Owners Club (AMOC). Events usuallyconsisted of shows, dinners, and/or tear-assingaround California dodging the ever-vigilantCalifornia Highway Patrol (CHP).[index-209_1.jpg][index-209_2.jpg]- 209 -“Chip” was not really the enemy; it was just aparent trying to keep reckless children from gettinginto trouble. It even had its own club: the CHP 11-99Foundation. [The name comes from the radio codefor “Officer Needs Assistance”; the Foundation is acharity for the families of officers injured or killed inline of duty.] As a Life 11-99 Member, I mentioned itin the car clubs and was unfailingly impressed athow many enthusiastically joined it.James Bond usually used his cars to rescuedamsels-in-distress. The CHP sometimes gets luckylike that, but also has to rescue everyone, andoccasionally everything - else too, in 2004 a sea lionwho got lost up in the Sacramento River Delta,whereupon locals, hearing its plaintive cries,naturally called you-know-whom.CHP immediately dispatched a car to the scene,but while the officers were discussing what to do,the sea lion decided that the nice, warm trunklid ofthe car was ideal for a sunning and nap - and up hejumped, contentedly refusing to leave. “Chippy” wasnow a statewide celebrity![index-210_1.jpg][index-210_2.jpg]- 210 -An hour or so later Chippy’s afternoon nap wasinterrupted by a rescue team from the CaliforniaMarine Mammal Center in Marin, who coaxed himsafely off the car and into a truck to take him to theCenter for checkup and release.That of course was not the end of his fame.Chippy was immortalized on hats, T-shirts, plushtoys, and Xmas-tree ornaments thereafter.As for Aston Martin, it would go on to make asingle DB10 for the latest/last Daniel Craig 007 filmSPECTRE (2015). This time the car ended up at thebottom of the Tiber River after a frenzied chasethrough Rome.At least the Craig-quartet of Bond movies finalédhappily, with a just-retired 007 motoringcontentedly off in the famous DB5, which the long-suffering Q had just finished completely restoringfrom what had survived Skyfall - its steering-wheel.Aston Martin currently produces both anupdated DBS reprising the model-name “Vanquish”,and a DB11 taking much of its styling from theexquisite One-77.But as far as I was concerned, my 2009 V8V wasan ideal “ECU” that was also [almost] affordable.Power, Beauty, Soul.[index-211_1.jpg][index-211_2.jpg][index-211_3.png]- 211 -19: 2011 Shelby GT5002011-2014Next year Ferrari’s ass is mine!- Carroll Shelby, after losingthe 24 Hours of Le Mans toFerrari in 1965. In 1966Shelby’s Ford GT40s took1st, 2nd, & 3rd at the race.[index-212_1.jpg][index-212_2.jpg][index-212_3.png][index-212_4.jpg]- 212 -As Brock Yates tells it in his biography of EnzoFerrari, in 1963 Henry Ford II made the decision toenter international championship car-racing, andattempted to buy Ferrari, which was financiallystruggling and looking for big-corporate funding -which it would ultimately find with Fiat. But now,after exhaustive negotiations, Enzo abruptly pulledthe plug on Henry, leaving Ford unaccustomedlyjilted. The automotive press howled with laughter.A furious Henry summoned Carroll Shelby to hisDearborn office and commissioned a Ford factoryracing team. “I want to kick his ass!”“That will be very expensive,” said Shelby.“Did I mention money?”And so Shelby, whose Cobras had already beenembarrassing Europe’s finest DOHC V12s withknuckle-dragging Ford pushrod 289 & 427 V8sshoehorned into British AC bodies, created theFord/Cobra F40. The cars broke down at LeMans in1964 & 1965, with Ferrari continuing his tradition ofwins of the famous race. But in 1966 Shelby fielded ateam of F40 Mark IIs, and they indeed kicked Enzo’sass, reportedly so angering the Commendatore that[index-213_1.jpg][index-213_2.jpg]- 213 -he ceased all participation in Le Mans thereafter,limiting Ferrari racing to Formula 1 Grand Prix.Back in the United States Ford’s Lee Iacocca wasalso annoyed that the spotlight of his successfulintroduction of the Mustang in 1964 had been stolenby that General Motors upstart Pontiac with itsGTO. He called Shelby back to Dearborn and toldhim to do something to the Mustang.Shelby was again dubious. “It’s a secretary’s car,”he said of the pretty but gentle Mustang. But heagreed to give it a try, and took some Mustangs tohis San Jose facilities to play with them.This wasn’t Carroll Shelby’s first attempt at“playing”. He’d already created the fearsome Cobrasby stuffing big American V8s into previouslyunderpowered British AC roadsters. And he’d donethe same thing to the limpid Sunbeam Alpine,jamming first a Ford 260 and then 289 V8 into it tocreate the Corvette-eating Sunbeam Tiger.What Carroll came up with for 1965 was ahopped-up Mustang called the GT-350. It was alimited-edition coupé, available only in white withtwo wide over-roof “Le Mans” blue stripes. Its starkblack interior got a wood Cobra steering wheel and acrude, dashtop tachometer & oil pressure housing.[index-214_1.jpg][index-214_2.png]- 214 -The GT-350 was loud, nasty, and had asuspension comparing favorably with Judah Ben-Hur’s chariot. The “Detroit Locker” rear end madethe whole car shudder with every shift. Amidstshowrooms full of vastly prettier and morecomfortable regular Mustangs, the GT-350 was aNeanderthal. American gearheads fell instantly inlove with it. Ford said keep going.The 1966 GT-350s were largely unchanged, butfor 1967 Ford did its first styling update of theMustang, and the GT-350 got a complete body-kit tobecome a truly beautiful - and budgetary! -challenge to Europe’s finest. “If you’re lonesome forItaly, eat spaghetti,” went an amused Shelbymagazine ad. “For what you’d pay for a Ferrari youcould buy three GT-350s and still have plenty ofmoney left over for pasta.”Through 1967 Shelby was building his convertedGT-350s [and now -500s] at an old airplane hangernear the Los Angeles Airport. But now Ford had[index-215_1.jpg][index-215_2.jpg]- 215 -realized that it had a genuine Ferrari-fighter onhand, and from 1968-on took over the project andmoved it to Dearborn. The 1968-9 “Shelbys” weremore polished and dramatic, but also heavier to thepoint of becoming more boulevard-cruiser thansportscar. After watching the unsold 1969s rebadgedas 1970s, Carroll pulled the plug and the projectended.That is, until 2000, when Angelina Jolie learnedthat she’d be sharing top heroine billing withEleanor in a remake of the classic 1974 car-chasemovie Gone in 60 Seconds. Eleanor was the last andmost spectacular of fifty exotic cars challenged to be“boosted” (= stolen) in a single night in Los Angelesby Nicholas Cage.It was a stellar boost-list of cars: Porsche,Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Audi,Bentley, Lotus. But a nervous Cage left Eleanor forthe last: a grey 1967 Shelby GT-500.A total of 13 1967 Mustangs were acquired andmodified for the film - each for a different high-speed stunt. For the finale chase scene, which beganin downtown Los Angeles, went through freeways- 216 -and the [dry] L.A. Riverbed, all the way to the bridgeacross the harbor into Long Beach, Eleanorappeared of course to be a single car - even when -as computer-generated-imagery (CGI) finishing witha flying leap over a line of cars stuck on the bridge,landing intact on the pavement past the jam. Whenon the riverbed even the GT-500’s tremendousvelocity was unable to outrun an overhead policehelicopter, Cage flipped a red switch labeledNITRO66 and Eleanor exploded forward at twice herprevious speed, leaving the chopper far behind.The movie had barely finished its theatrical runwhen custom shops sprang up across the country,buying up serviceable 1967 Mustang fastbacks andrestoring & r-equipping them as Eleanors. It was notuncommon to see such meticulous conversionspriced upwards of $200K, with optional nitrouscomponents which owners were warned not toactivate.It didn’t take both Ford and Shelby Americanlong to realize they were missing out on a gold mine.In 2007 they introduced a new Ford/ShelbyGT-500, with state-0f-the-art mechanicals and asupercharged 500hp DOHC V8 to keep upappearances.Carroll Shelby’s active involvement was easilythe most revered aspect of this adventure. He hadsurvived a host of health crises, by the time of thenew GT-500 project having had both a heart and akidney replacement. Nevertheless “Ol’ Snake” stoodproudly with Ford CEO Bill Ford for the unveiling:66 When nitrous oxide (N2O) replaces oxygen in an internal-combustion engine, the result is a substantial increase inpower. Such engines in drag-racers must be specially designedto handle the pressure; a normal car engine, such as that in aGT-500, would be ruined by one such experience.[index-217_1.jpg][index-217_2.jpg][index-217_3.jpg][index-217_4.jpg]- 217 -I had of course been too “budget-challenged” as auniversity undergraduate to even think about one ofthe original Shelbys back in the 1960s; it was veryconsiderate of Ford & Shelby American - not tomention Carroll Shelby personally! - to bring thisbeast back a half-century later. Did I need a GT-500to keep the Aston company? Of course not. Was thatthe least relevant? Also of course not. I begannegotiating with Ford dealerships the length ofCalifornia, and four years later adopted an elegantdark blue 2011 from James Ford in Half Moon Bay.Shelbys were almost impossible for dealers to get;those who did usually got only one.

I expected both of thesemagnificent machines to be with me until I kickedthe proverbial bucket.- 222 -What unexpectedly happened instead was thatby 2014, to my intense chagrin, my eyesight hadbegun to fade after 68 years of service. I could stillpass the driver’s license day/night vision test, but itwas increasingly obvious that safety now ruled outhigh speeds and adroit maneuvers. Even with bifocalglasses with the bottoms tuned to the dashboards,the æsthetic-but-miniscule gauges and displays ofthe two exotics didn’t reach my brain withoutprolonged staring, which is obviously impossiblewhile driving.So resignedly I began looking around to see ifthere might be an at-least-tolerable, if not thrillingvehicle to accompany me the remaining distance tothe tomb.What I eventually came across turned out to benot just adequate, but a substantial improvement inall respects, not to mention a blast: a Smart Brabus.For the last few years I’d been vaguely aware of avery small car darting around San Francisco: the“Smart” (or to be precise “SmartForTwo”). It was astall as a regular car, but about half the length of aVW New Beetle. What caught my attention now wasits extensive expanse of glass: vast windows on allsides, along with a roof-lining which could slidecompletely back. Vision in the Aston and Shelby, onthe other hand, was much more constrained; theywere both designed as much to create dramaticexternal impressions as for driver awareness: theGT-500’s rear-quarter windows were covered by thetrademark air-scoops, while the V8V’s rear windowwas minimized between the sculptured panels.Smart is a subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz, whichchose to export it, rather than its own ultracompactA-series, to the United States. At San Francisco’s M-B/S showroom I was surprised by the Smart’s- 223 -roominess and seat-comfort, and the gauges all hadlarge, bright displays. The luggage compartmentbehind the seats was almost as large as the Aston’s -close to the Mustang’s when the passenger seat wasfolded completely flat.There seemed to be no place for the engine eitherfore or aft. When I finally gave up, the smiling salesmanager pulled up the trunk carpet to reveal allthree cylinders of it.I expected the car to be clumsy and power-ænemic; surprisingly it gripped the road smoothlyand took off, well, “smartly”. This I learned was dueto its light-weight, which the engine and 6-speedtransmission had no trouble moving.Safety concerns were alleviated upon inspectinga body-panel-stripped car in the showroom; aningenious titanium “safety cell” surrounded thecabin, with a full array of airbags. I was beginning tobe impressed.Those bodywork-panels turned out to be easily-removable, and came in sets of 8. If your Smart werescraped or dented, just slap on a new panel. If youtired of one color car, stack the existing panels in thegarage and drive off with a completely different set.In addition to a rainbow of solid colors, you couldalso get leopard-spots, zebra-stripes, hippie-florals,woodies, or primed blanks for personal creativity.As you might gather from this book, I never paidmuch attention to fuel-economy in my fetishism.You could practically watch the gas-gauge movewhile idling the Viper. The Smart was 35 city/40highway.Only one obstacle remained: As cute as theseEaster Eggs were, they weren’t, you know, JamesBond suave. I couldn’t see myself making a dramaticarrival at the Casino Royale with gorgeous Lilith at- 224 -my side - in Benny the taxicab from Who FramedRoger Rabbit!The nice young sales manager was undeterred.“One moment, Mr. Bond.” He returned from hisoffice with a fax from the factory announcing alimited-edition collaboration with the Germanracing organization Brabus. For 2013 only a “SmartBrabus” was to be created, and the San Franciscodealer was allocated one. Would I care to order it?Here I should point out that the regular Smartstickerprices at about $12K; you can practically putone on a Visa card. Now Brabus proposed to do tothe Smart what Lotus did to the Cortina and Shelbydid to the Mustang; it would take the car up to $18K,which was less than the sales tax on the Aston! Ilooked through the faxes.The Brabus came in solid silver, not the usualSmart two-tones. All the bodywork was custom, withBrabus alloy wheels and fatter tires. Recalibratedengine, strengthened suspension, twin tunedexhaust. Inside full black leather & brushed silverinstrumentation, more gauges including tachometer,Brabus carpets, leather-wrapped steering-wheel &shift-knob. Navigation, OnStar, HID headlights(thrice brighter than the standard halogens).The Brabus’ sound-system needs to be precededby the evolutionary climb throughout the time-period of this book. In the 1960s most cars hadsimple monophonic AM radios. Over time: AM/FM,stereo, 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, single-CDs, CDchangers, satellite radio, iPod connectors, andfinally the Smart Brabus’ multispeaker surround-sound with your entire music library stored on acomputer-chip the size of a postage stamp, withcontrols by voice as well as touch-screen.- 225 -Lest the reader be kept in suspense, yes, I pulledout my Visa card and ordered the Brabus, whichtook the gnomes about 8 months to produce, butupon its 2014 arrival even exceeded expectations.There might be some onlooker puzzlement when itgrowls up to the Casino Royale, but certainly nosnickering.As noted in the V8V chapter, San Francisco is acramped, overtrafficked urb, with parking-spacesconstantly shrinking in size while simultaneouslyincreasing in metering-fees: currently 25¢/5-minutes in some areas.Well, I haven’t spent a single nickel sinceacquiring the Smart. It fits nicely in the armpits ofcity streets, in niches too small for marking asparking spaces with/without meters. After a fewmonths of this postapocalyptic arrogance, Isuggested to the sales manager that he should makea stencil, grab a spraypaint-can, and scout the city:“If you had a Smart, you could park here for free.”But I don’t think he wants to anger metercash-hungry City Hall.Oh, yes, there’s a Smart wristwatch. Not $45K,$3K, or even the Shelby’s $15 - but $3, with anaccurate chip-mechanism and the Smart’s C>emblem on the dialface. I’m not partial to leatherstraps, so spent $12 at a local watch shop for ametalflex one.So as Robby 67 and I cruise off into the sunset ofthis book, and eventually our time here, somereflections on the “long, strange trip” related in thisbook:67 My SB’s name, after the equally-versatile robot of ForbiddenPlanet.- 226 -For starters, I think that such an odyssey wouldbe possible only for a “Postwar Baby Boomer”: anAmerican middle-class White male born shortlyafter the end of World War II. Automobiles existedbefore then, but with very rare exceptions they weredull, unimaginative workhorses. In 2018, at theother end of the timespan, vehicles have becomevery safe and technologically-advanced, but in theprocess have lost the personality, the variety, thewildness that made them interesting and exciting.Prewar cars looked very much the same: squared-offblack sedans. Today’s also look the same: grey,blobbish SAVs68 with invisible, unsensableautomatic transmissions; it’s rare to find anyonenow who even knows how to use, much less desiresor cares about a floor-mounted “stick shift”.In an increasingly anti-fossil-fuel social culture,gasoline-engines - particularly large, thirsty ones -have lost their glamor in favor of unobtrusive,economical motors, with the trend towards gas/electric “hybrids” and eventually full-electricconveyances, all neutral, silent, caratonic.Cars full of motors, painted green;Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream;Arms that can only lift a spoon:Everyone’s gone to the Moon. 69Constantly-tightening personal & family budgetsdisfavor extravagances such as expensive cars, whilethe “conspicuous consumption” glitterglamor ofMiami Vice’s 1980s is now viewed as adolescent,68 Commonly called SUVs (Sport Utility Vehicles).

Marlon Brando’s outlaw-motorcyclistWild One was followed by James Dean’s RebelWithout a Cause and his fatal Porsche crash. Theacme of 1960s car-craziness is memorialized in theglitzy, sexy cruising and delinquent drag-racing ofAmerican Graffiti and the motorcycle mortality ofEasy Rider.Even among Boomers the past seven decadeshave not been comfortably car-conducive. As kids inthe 1950s, we spent our childhood precariouslyclamped in the chrome jaws of mammoth rollingjukeboxes70 with gleaming steel breasts on theirbumpers and Jaws-ominous shark fins on the rear.Two giant bug-eyes doubled into four, and thesedinosaurs continued to grow, mutating intoeverything from stretch-limos with jacuzzis on theirback decks to huge Winnebagos resembling self-propelled houses.In the 1960s we began to get our own driver’slicenses. It was not enough to wheedle the familysedan. Escape-pods had to be raw, hot, and fast. Thespirit of Moloch prevailed in GTOs, Corvettes,Cobras, GranSports, 442s, SS-396s, whileCountercultural hippies and earth-mothers chuggedaround in tie-dyed VW buses with the VWnosemblem replaced with the Peace Symbol while70 The Metropolis chrome, plastic, bubbling & brightlit gods of1950s’ Googie coffeeshops, often with their dæmonic servitorscrouched on every tabletop, demanding a constant tribute ofdimes and quarters, which they would contemptuouslyacknowledge with obscene ululations and loathsome litanies.- 228 -Adolf Hitler’s wolf smiled at them from each horn-button.This Autodämmerung ended in the conflagrationof the 1970s’ Arab Oil Embargo and increasinglyemaciated cars lined up at empty gas stations whennot staggering shamefully along at 55mph on90mph-capable Interstates.Tanks and wallets were refilled in the 1980s,with cars’ muscularity now less important than theirstratospheric prices. Sonny Crockett couldn’tpossibly fight crime without a Testarossa tooutflaunt the drug lords’ Lambos, while thecustomized Lincoln Batmobile of Adam West wasunthinkable for Michael Keaton; he needed a raging,roboticized batarmadillo.The 1990s brought another financial freakout,followed first by the disorientation and hysteria of9/11 and then the more catastrophic plunge into theabyss of 2007. First extravagant cars, then theirdealerships, then entire companies disintegratedand have not since recovered.So this book is not so much a typical as aniconoclastic, even psychosensual journey throughthese alien atmospheres, like Captain Nemo in hisNautilus or Captain Hendrick van der Decken of theFlying Dutchman. The vehicle is at once a cyborgianchallenge to the Objective Universe surrounding it,and yet a Subjective Universal avatar from which themagician cannot leave without risk of annihilation.Men more than women seem to need magicalprojections of themselves: external talismans intowhich they have instilled a crucial part ofthemselves, and without which they cannot function- 229 -or even survive. 71 In the scope of this book the carmay be one such modern example; others areceremonial or real weapons such as guns, car-aliasessuch as horses or boats. As actual transportationgives way to the electronic/virtual, the ubiquitousbut omnipresent & omnipotent iPhone.Mythology is also replete with examples: KingArthur’s Excalibur, Prince Valiant’s Singing Sword,Sauron’s One Ring, Aragorn’s Andúril, Gandalf’sstaff, Barnabas Collins’ wolf-cane.

Monarchs have sceptres; even the UnitedStates has a Mace. 73If America, and possibly the rest of the world, isentering a Brave New World where the iPhone is thenew sword, mace, sceptre, or car, there are someunanticipated and unprecedented implications.Most obviously, the iPhone [including any other“smart phone”] is not a purely or even substantiallyself-created talisman. Rather it is a medium, arepository for the creations and controls of others -e.g. software, Internet service providers, and mostinsidiously applications (“apps”): all of which shape,channel, and limit the nominally-owning individual.There is an uneasy allusion to the magic rings ofMiddle-earth, which seemed to be independently71 Women, by contrast, are their own talismans - ostensiblybecause of their self-contained power to create new life, forwhich men are only momentary necessities.72 The serial number of each awarded Yarborough is recordedin the Special Forces Museum of the John F.

The translated text of the stones seems tocorroborate this.On the other side of the courtyard flows the LostRiver. There is a secret, underground, underwaterpassage to a small room inside the temple, not farpast the entry temple.Within the courtyard can be observed tallcolumns with snakes carved onto their sides, toppedby braziers.

Because of thewarnings on the map, the team proceeded veryslowly.This notebook is open to my sketches of the twochambers immediately above this one. The lower ofthe two, inscribed as “Rest of Servants”, was foundto contain the mummified remains of presumedpriests or elders of the cult. Before the temple wasshipped to Anaheim, these were respectfully re-interred at the original site in India.The second, smaller/higher chamber contained asmall Mara-idol similar to the image on the entry- 237 -wall-mural, but with closed eyes.

The canal ended in a flooded roombeneath the entry-area, with an overhead trapdoor to justbeyond the cave-in.

Onefree evening I strolled up Wisconsin Avenue to atheater showing Raiders of the Lost Ark, aboutwhich I had read enthusiastic but unilluminatingreviews in the media. Why the fuss about one moretreasure-hunt adventure movie? And indeed that ishow many of even the most enthusiastic fansdescribed it.But to me there was a mystery and poignancyabout this particular story and its characters. Theoffscreen-fame of the character notwithstanding,Indiana Jones was a lonely, obscure scholar, whose- 250 -archæological efforts seemed to have been markedby more frustration and failure than success. Fromthe Hovitos idol at the film’s beginning to the Ark ofthe Covenant at its conclusion, everything was lostto him. Well, not everything, because it turned outthe real treasure he had found was another lost soulnamed Marion Ravenwood.Lethal antihero James Bond survived endlessthreats against his life by skillfully killing theattackers or evading them with spectaculartechnology. Indiana Jones survived endless threatsagainst his life by desperate ingenuity combinedwith the most extraordinary dumb luck. 007 alwaysfulfilled his professional missions; Dr. Jones, despitefinal discovery, always failed at his.It may be glamorous and prestigious to be anMI6 secret agent, but the life of a lone archæologistin the early 20th century was quite another thing.That profession has always occupied an uneasyniche between scholarship and grave-robbing, andbetween preserving and stealing ancient treasures.[Even some of the most distinguished museumshave found irate nations or cultural groupsdemanding the return of once-“legitimately”-acquired exhibits.] Digs themselves can be fraughtwith danger - cave-ins, disease, local resentment,unscrupulous competitors (such as Belloq) orthieves (such as Satipo), and of course boobytraps ...and snakes.Nor did Indiana’s love life fare much better.James always got at least one [and often several]gorgeous girls along the way. Marion greeted Indywith a hook to the jaw in Raiders; he was saddledwith a hysterical airhead in Temple of Doom; he wasbetrayed by a Nazi vixen in Last Crusade. In hisearlier years, as related in television’s Young- 251 -Indiana Jones Chronicles, he attempted manyromances from an Austrian princess to Mata Hari,but inevitably with lucklessness or tragedy.In 1981 I was not aware of this glum “future/past” that Lucasfilm had in store for Indiana Jones.I just thought that after all of that effort, fright, andinjury he and Marion deserved closure concerningthe Ark. So after pondering this a few days, I decidedto give it to them. [That they might separate, as inthe Lucasfilm scenario, rather than marry, neveroccurred to me: This consolation and happiness atleast I assumed they deserved.]Then, too, I was curious about the Ark of theCovenant. As it happens I had never heard of thisitem prior to seeing the film. As a nonJew who hadessentially lost interest in Bible-mythology at aboutthe time I stopped believing in Santa Claus and theEaster Bunny, this is perhaps not all that surprising.Raiders of course premised the Ark as a very real,very powerful iGod. If you left the theater withoutimmediately converting to Judaism, you were clearlyas headed down the wrong road as if you hadsimilarly ignored the warnings of The TenCommandments or Sodom and Gomorrah. Thisdeity you didn’t cross, else he would deluge you,earthquake you, or [in 1981] blowtorch your face.It seemed to Major Aquino that if the Joneseswere going to be reunited with their Ark, I wouldhave to find out where the U.S. Government hadstashed it away, or at least whether it existed at all.One nice thing about being an officer within theIntelligence community is that one can generallyfind out a lot about a given object of interest, veryquickly. We had plenty of classified storage facilities,it seemed, but unfortunately no Ark therein. Shucks.[index-252_1.jpg][index-252_2.jpg]- 252 -In the process of looking for the thing, however, Ifound out a great deal about it, or perhaps I shouldsay “non-it”, because the unfolding historicalevidence was that it had never existed outside of itsmention in the Old Testament. Nor, for that matter,had the entire “Exodus from Egypt” episode.Millions of people and animals wandering about theSinai Peninsula for forty years would have left plentyof litter and graffiti; there is none. Nor does such aforty-year tramp seem sensible, since the actualdistance between the Egyptian border andJerusalem can be easily walked in about five days. Ina single-file line the leader of two million peoplewould arrive before the last one had lost sight of theNile.Just as surprisingly, however, there turned out tobe a good deal of information about divine/magicalarks in the literature and mythology of ancientEgypt. The Egyptians used ark-boxes and -shrinesfor many memorial purposes, such as this one inTutankhamun’s tomb:- 253 -Nor did what we know today as the Jewishreligion actually exist at the time represented in theBible. Ancient Hebrew religion progressed throughfour stages: (1) pre-Mosaic animism and magic, (2)national monolatry (one god but toleration ofothers), (3) monotheism, and (4) dualism [adaptedfrom Persian Zoroastrianism (after Zarathustra, ca.600 BCE)]. Dualism involves a conflict between twoopposing forces of the cosmos - in Persia AhuraMazda vs. Ahriman, and later in Israel El vs. Satan.The Hebraic Ten Commandments are now dated bymost Old Testament scholars to ca. 600 BCE, someseven centuries later than the biblical Exodus.For modern political and emotional reasons, ofcourse, such realities are not usually mentioned inproper social circles. If there were not only noExodus and no Ark of the Covenant, but also noKings David or Solomon (for all of which & whomthere remains no conclusive archæologicalevidence), then contemporary Israel’s claim tohistoric ownership of its current territory is baseless- obviously an awkwardly-inconvenient taboo.Most people assume that the academic field ofarchæology is so obscure and technical a specialtythat its professionals are insulated from ordinaryconcerns of present-day society - free to live, work,and revel in the distant past. Quite the contrary,archæologists are under considerable pressure tofind, authenticate, and publicize only thosediscoveries which support today’s established andaccepted versions of history.In 1972 I wrote an article in which I observed:Our earliest evidence of man dates to about 1million years ago. In South Africa a large number offossil remains of mutated apes has been found.- 254 -Classified as Australopithecines, these pre-menpossess human-like hip and thigh bones in additionto enlarged cranial capacities of between 400cc and600cc. Conventional theories of evolution cansubstantiate the continued mutation of this man-ape[ o r h i s c o n t e m p o r a r i e s ] t o t h e s t a g e o fPithecanthropus Erectus - a skull fragment found inJava with an estimated capacity of about 900cc.Later versions of Pithecanthropus have evidencedskulls of up to 1,100cc. And here we encounter theenigma of the “missing link”.The Java remains date to the Lower-Paleolithicperiod - about 800,000 years ago. The next twodefinitive ancestors of modern man, Cro-Magnonand Neanderthal, did not appear until the Middle-Paleolithic period - about 100,000 years ago. Thereis some question, then, about the interim 700,000years. Nor is this the only “missing link” period.Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal, who wereapproximate contemporaries, possessed cranialcapacities respectively of up to 1,700cc and 1,500cc.How and why did these startling enlargementsoccur? And why was Cro-Magnon’s cranium inparticular larger than that of present-day man, whoaverages 1,400cc?The rest of that article, and more recent relatedtheory, emphasizes the “startling enlargements”.Here I want to focus on the point that high-intelligence human beings have been around for atleast the last 100,000 years.Now consider: That’s a long time. From todayback through to conventional archæology’s“beginning of history” (+/-3000 BCE) is a mere5,000 years. That leaves 95,000 years when human- 255 -beings like ourselves were hanging around thisplanet doing ... what? Just goofing off?This is one of those questions so inconvenientand annoying, like the building of the GreatPyramid, that conventional archæology responds toit by basically “not trying”. Those embarrassing95,000 years are “fast-forwarded” through intextbooks as hurriedly as possible [“there was somemigration, some arrowhead-chipping, some animaldomestication ...”], to get to the safe ground ofGerzean (predynastic) Egypt, Mesopotamia, and soon.And of course “recognition” of perfectly normalmodern human beings from [at least] 100,000 yearsago boots conventional religions, such as Judæo/Christianity and Islam, right out the door. There isno conceivable way that their creationist legends canbe made to stretch back that far.In 1996 historical scholar Patty Hardy posted toone Internet discussion:I wish to direct your attention to something DonWebb tossed out over a year ago. It concerned thespeculation of the geneticists, the so-called “Evehypothesis” based on oddities of human mitochondrialDNA and its rate of mutation. According to this theory,all modern humans appeared to be related to anindividual thought to have lived perhaps 200,000years ago. Paleontologists, mindful of the numeroushominid forms scattered around the globe for perhapsa million years, criticized the theory.A few months later, archæologists announced inScience magazine a controversial discovery. Based onfour different dating techniques, they dated certaincarved bone tools to between 80,000 and 170,000years of age - a “push back” from an age of 14,000years for such tools found elsewhere.Earlier this month another team of geneticistsannounced a finding. Using genetic studies of 42human populations around the globe, these- 256 -researchers concluded that all modern humansthroughout the world were indeed descended from asmall population - perhaps fewer than a thousand, oneresearcher told the press - who left Africa between70,000 and 100,000 years ago, replacing all otherhominids.In many cultures scattered throughout the Earth,legend states that a fantastic creature or deitybestowed a gift upon the ancestors that became thebasis of civilization. The first question: Are theselegends recitals of an event passed on by oral tradition,or are they a recollection from within - the result of theprinciple of self-awareness turned upon itself?The second question: If our scientific methodsidentify the “original modern human” in genetic terms,will this be the proof of the material character of thepsyche, its genetic foundation? Or would this mistakethe gift Itself for the sign of its presence, the success ofits ancient recipients?In 1993 two troublemakers decided to rile up thesleeping dog of human prehistory even further.Their names were Michael Cremo and RichardThompson, and they wrote a big, fat book entitledForbidden Archæology: The Hidden History of theHuman Race (San Diego: Bhaktivedanta Institute,1993 - ISBN: 0-9635309-8-4). The book is a giganticcompendium of all sorts of “inconvenient”archæological data that conventional archæologyhas preferred to ignore or “fast-forward” through. Atthe end of this tome the authors blithely propose thesignificance of this data: that “beings resemblinganatomically-modern humans were present in theEarly Pleistocene and Pliocene”.Everybody sitting down? The Early Pleistocenetakes us back about 1.7 million years, and thePliocene reaches back to around 3.5 million years.[So much for my mere 100,000 years.]A year later Cremo & Thompson followed FAwith a less-technical. abridged version entitled just- 257 -The Hidden History of the Human Race (Badger,CA: Govardhan Hill, 1994).If conventional archæology just ignores the100,000-year problem like a mad aunt locked in thecellar, you can imagine what the reaction toForbidden Archæology was, i.e. flat-out fury. The1996 issue (#IV-1) of Skeptic contains an article“Hidden History, Hidden Agenda” by BradleyLepper (Curator of Archæology, Ohio HistoricalSociety) pouring boiling cauldrons of scorn onHHHR, complaining that it “mixed together agenuine contribution to our understanding of thehistory of archæology and paleoanthropology with abewildering mass of absurd claims and anaudaciously distorted review of the current state ofpaleoanthropology”. [Try to say that in a singlebreath.] After complaining that C&T are “ignorant”,“naïve”, and “selectively credulous to an astonishingdegree”, Lepper hammers his lectern and zings hisfinale:Cremo and Thompson’s claim that anatomicallymodern homo sapiens have been around for hundredsof millions of years is an outrageous notion. Acceptingthat there is a place in science for seeminglyoutrageous hypotheses, there is no justification for thesort of sloppy rehashing of canards, hoaxes, redherrings, half-truths, and fantasies Cremo andThompson offer in the service of a religious ideology.The “religious ideology” in question is of coursenot Judæo/Christianity or Islam. As previouslynoted, they are incompatible with even a 95,000-year human prehistory. What Lepper is apoplecticabout are the Vedas, which, while not figuring per sein C&T’s books, are distant-past compatible. AndC&T happen to be, as they acknowledge at thebeginning of their books, Vedics.- 258 -The Vedas may not have been compatible withthe Hebrew/Judaic premise of Raiders of the LostArk, nor with the Christian premise of The LastCrusade, but they do fit in nicely with the Shiva &Kali-worship of Temple of Doom. As for the ancient“interdimensional beings” of Kingdom of theCrystal Skull who collected souvenirs from all ofhumanity’s ancient civilizations, this [prehi]storyexploded the religious premises of all three previousIndiana Jones films, leaving us finally with theprotoancient imparting of high intelligence tohumans by a being or beings Not Of This Earth.So Dr. Henry “Indiana” Jones, hoping perhaps tofind in archæology a scholarly haven from thehorrors of World War I and other early-20th-century perils which had darkened his adolescentyears, could scarcely have made a worse careerchoice!Nevertheless, in late 1981, I set out to solve theSecret of the Lost Ark.If I were returning the fictional Ark to plausiblereality, I reasoned, then I would also need a realIndiana and Marion Jones to decipher that secret.More research revealed that these two individualshad not sprung extemporaneously from theimaginations of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg,but drew from a variety of previous inspirations. Allthat I needed at DIA was to follow these trails evenfurther back, which brought the Joneses very muchto life.The renowned fantasy & horror author H.P.Lovecraft was fond not only of using a tantalizingmixture of real and fictional locations in his stories,but of inserting some of his close friends toadventure within them. Feeling that the Jonesesmight need and enjoy some companionship,- 259 -particularly in respect of their golden years [thiswas, after all, 1981!], I drafted some unsuspectingacquaintances. As high U.S. government securityclearances were prerequisite, Lt. Colonel DennisMann and his wife Major Karen Revay foundthemselves the bewildered protagonists, helped atvarious moments of need by other mutual chumspossessing specialized knowledge.With the invaluable help of the DIA library, all ofthe locations through which our four explorerstraveled are described accurately, indeed so much sothat I have heard of more than a few readers’ ascentup Martin Bormann’s brass elevator to theKehlsteinhaus to examine the concealed repositorybehind the mural within its massive fireplace. [WellO.K., I had to go and look for myself too, asphotographed herein.]Once more, however, Dr. Jones’ quest was to endin personal fulfillment but public failure. Thepresent Egyptian Department of Antiquities haseither failed to find, or refused to acknowledge anysuch discoveries as are related here; nor, for reasonsof its own, has the Israeli government. And despitepersistent questioning over the years, Dennis andKaren doggedly maintain that the entire accountwas purely fictional.Which was the assumption of Don Webb andStephen Flowers until 1998, when a startling lectureat the University of Texas shook their complacency.And now it seemed that yet another famous religiousicon, the Holy Grail of Christianity, was in its turn tobe investigated past what Lucasfilm had portrayedin 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Like the Ark of the Covenant, the Grail turns outto be considerably more mysterious than in theChristian myth shown in the film. According to that- 260 -popular tale, it was the cup from which Jesus Christdrank at the Last Supper, after which it was used byJoseph of Arimathea to catch the blood of thecrucified savior. It was then sealed and dispatchedto Britain, where, because of its holy qualities, itbecame the object of an intense search by theknights of King Arthur’s Round Table. It was finallyfound by Sir Perceval [or Sir Galahad], whereupon itvanished from the Earth.Such is the version which has come to us via theWestern Christian tradition. A careful examinationinto the source material of the Grail legends,however, presents us with a far older, more complexmyth-cycle.The roots of the Grail tradition are all but extinct.Various scholars have suggested its literary origin inPersia, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Phœnicia, Spain, andeven China and Mongolia. But it may just as easilybe Celtic, Irish, or Scandinavian. We arearchæologists only incidentally, however; ourpresent interest lies in the substance of the legend.Of the scores of books which touch upon theGrail, 79 one of the most excellent is The GrailLegend by Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz.Originally published for the C.G. Jung Foundationfor Analytical Psychology, it approaches the Grailfrom a number of contrasting hypotheses.Jung identifies three major histories of the Grailfrom among the many versions that have beenrecorded. The eldest is Chrétien de Troyes’ Li Contes79 The definitive treatment of the symbolism of the Grail [andmany other things] in the Parsifal opera of Richard Wagner isFranz E. Winkler’s For Freedom Destined (Garden City, NewYork: Waldorf Press Publishers, 1974). This volume alsocontains the definitive treatment of the symbolism in Wagner’sRing cycle.- 261 -del Graal, a cycle of poems written during the lasthalf of the 12th century CE. Slightly later cameRobert de Boron’s Roman de l’Estoire dou Graal(about 1180-1199), a 3-part saga containing thestories of Joseph of Arimathea, Merlin, andPerceval. Finally there is the best-known and mostelaborate version, Wolfram von Eschenbach’sParzival, completed in about 1207 CE.Although there are certain distinctions betweeneach version, the basic story of the Grail is fairlyconsistent:After various exploits Sir Perceval, a knight ofthe Round Table, finds himself at the edge of anunknown river. A richly-garbed fisherman directshim to a strange castle, which materializesmysteriously before the knight upon his approach.Upon entering, Perceval is welcomed by the GrailKing, who is revealed to be the fisherman as well. Inhis side is an open wound which will not close. Theking presents Perceval with a sword and invites himto dine. A procession enters the hall, with maidenscarrying the Grail, a spear that is dripping blood,and a finely-worked platter. Perceval fears to ask themeaning of these curious artifacts, and the king,castle, and Grail vanish. An oracle tells him that hisfailure to inquire into the meaning of the Grailcaused the castle to disappear, and that the king andkingdom will continue to suffer until Perceval hasfound them again.After a series of adventures, Perceval again findsthe Grail castle. This time he asks the properquestions, and the king’s wound is healed.Prosperity returns to the kingdom, and the king diesnaturally a short time later. Perceval then becomesthe new King of the Grail.- 262 -In the Christian interpretation the Grail was thecup of Christ, while the spear was the one whichwounded him during the crucifixion. No significantmeaning is ascribed to the platter. The sword,according to one source, was originally the sword ofDavid, reworked by Solomon, enchanted, and finallysent via a magical ship to Solomon’s finaldescendant for use in the Grail quest. The four"},{"pageContent":"devices, according to Cavendish, have been used toname the four suits of the Tarot deck.The word “grail” originated, according to someauthorities, in the Latin gradale (deep plate orbowl). Others suggest that it is derived from grele(hailstone), and consequently there is someconfusion as to whether the Grail is a cup or a stone.In de Troyes it is described only as a “vessel”; deBoron identifies it as a chalice; von Eschenbachpronounces it a stone:They [the Knights of the Grail] live from a stone ofpurest kind.If you do not know it,It shall here be named to you.It is called lapsit exillis.This curious description has given rise toadditional conjecture. One authority corrects it tolapsit ex cœlis, a derivation of the Greek term formeteorites, “stone with a spirit”. Various legendsdepict the Grail as a jewel that fell from Satan’scrown during the war in Heaven, while vonEschenbach relates that it was subsequently guardedon Earth by the zwivelære (doubters), the angelswho took neither side in the conflict.Alchemists will immediately suspect anotherallusion to the stone Grail - the famousPhilosopher’s Stone. It is noteworthy that the Stone- 263 -in alchemy is identified with the alchemicalMercurius, a being of dual aspect who may beidentified with Baphomet. According to Jung thePhilosopher’s Stone - and thus the Grail - is “amatrix in which the archetype of the self istransformed” [which means that it changes yourbasic personality, in case you aren’t as Jung as you’dlike to be]. An old text entitled Allegoriæ Sapientumobserves: “Thus our Stone, that is the flask of fire, iscreated from fire.” The elemental of the Stone is thedragon, which, if you’re really prone to wildspeculation, brings to mind the name of Perceval’s[and Arthur’s] ancestor, Uther Pendragon(“Dragon’s Head”).If, on the other hand, the Grail is considered acup, variations upon the theme are abundantthroughout mythology. In ancient Egypt the vitalfluids/organs of the dead were buried with specialveneration in jars bearing the heads of Horus’ foursons. In Orphic Gnosticism reverence was given tothe Cup of Anacreon, as it imparted divineknowledge. According to the ancient Persians, allthe world’s mysteries could be perceived in the Cupof Jamshyd, while Mohammed, during one of hisAstral expeditions, glimpsed “a goblet of greenishbrilliance” illuminating all of the seven heavens. Inthe 3rd century CE the Egyptian Gnostic Zosimos ofPanopolis envisioned a cosmic altar in the form of ashallow bowl, “in which men in torment were beingcooked to attain a state of spirituality”(!).In 1991 I no longer had the resources of DIA toassist me; but as it turned out those of the U.S.Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain, where Iwas now assigned as a Space Intelligence Officer,were very helpful in researching the notion that theactual Grail had arrived from beyond this planet.- 264 -Although the occasional noise from the Stargatedownstairs was distracting, I was able to pick up thetrail of the Grail from its disappearance in ancientBritain, following it to, of all places, Californiaduring the era of the Spanish missions. And finallyto, as recounted, the suppressed and disavowed, butvery real and verifiable original Mission LaPurisima Concepción, whose forbidden ruinsconcealed ... what?Few things that I have written have gotten meinto as much trouble as Secret of the Lost Ark andGrail Mission. Like Dennis, Karen, Don, andStephen, I have repeatedly and emphatically deniedthat they are anything but fiction, but it seems thereare always a few who suspect that this is merelyanother coverup of knowledge too shocking andfrightful to be entrusted to the public. It is to finallydispel such absurd notions that I have written thisIntrocaution to the stories which now follow.

Quite aFebruary!- Don Webb“Notes from Neheh”Scroll of Set, April 199711:38 PM, Saturday, January 4, 1997; home of Donand Rosemary Webb, Austin, Texas:“Don!” called Rosemary Webb. “Stephen on thephone -”“Coming,” said her husband, rubbing his eyes ashe hurried in from the study. Never get used to howfast time flies at a computer keyboard, he thought.Rosemary had left the handset on the chair; hepicked it up and stifled a yawn. [What time was it?]“Stephen? Don here.”- 266 -The measured voice of Stephen Flowers cameback at him. Always so deliberate, Don thought. Butwhy a call at this time of night?“I’m sorry to phone so late, but I just found outabout a lecture at the campus I want to drive in tocatch tomorrow. 3 PM. It’s on old Californiaarchæology, at the UTC, and you’ll never guesswho’s giving it.” He paused, evidently enjoyinghimself.“O.K., I’ll bite. Who?”There was a rustle of paper at the other end ofthe phone. Stephen cleared his throat for effect:“The title of the lecture is ‘The Riddle of Drake’sLanding in California’ and the speaker is Marion R.Jones, M.A., Visiting Docent, J. Paul Getty Museumof Santa Monica.”Don spent about thirty seconds wondering whyhe - or Flowers - should give a damn about SirFrancis Drake (particularly at this hour). Then hismind registered what Stephen had said. “Who didyou say she was? Did you say -”“Marion Jones.”“You don’t think it’s the same - that story ofMichael’s - I mean, that was just made up, right?Got to be a coincidence.” Don got a grip on himself,felt foolish. I’ve been writing too much fiction, hethought irritably.“Could be,” answered Stephen. “But then I’venever been able to get a straight answer out ofDennis or Karen, or Peter Rivera for that matter,about Secret of the Lost Ark. And Michael just givesme that Cheshire Cat smile when I ask him. But, youknow, Rebecca Lance told me last year that sherecalled once seeing someone who she thoughtlooked an awful lot like Harrison Ford at Peter’splace in Oakland. She said she was just in and out,- 267 -and didn’t want to put her foot in it if it were just acoincidence, but after reading that narrative acouple of years later she wasn’t so sure.”“What about Roland?”“Winkhart? He also told me that he did meetDennis and Karen at the Munich airport a few yearsago, and that there were two people with them thathe mistook for Ford and Karen Allen. But he saidthat when he found out they weren’t, he didn’t paythat much attention to them. He was busy trying toget all of their ticketing straightened out.”“That’s two corroborations …”“Only maybe. On the other hand, tomorrow wejust might get something more.”“Or make fools of ourselves.”“Or that. By your place about 2? The worst thatcan happen is that we’ll find out more than we everwanted to know about Drake.”“I wouldn’t miss it.”2:55 PM, Sunday, January 5, 1997; University ofTexas, Austin:Stephen Flowers found a parking space next tothe LBJ Library, and the two friends strolledleisurely across the campus to the UniversityTeaching Center, a somewhat awkward polygon ofwhite limestone and glass that clashed glaringly withthe older classical architecture adjoining it. Dondecided that every university he’d ever visited hadone building that didn’t fit with the prevailing style.Not all of them were such monstrosities, however.The campus was still on holiday break andseemed nearly deserted. Don wondered why thislecture had been scheduled for a date almostguaranteeing it modest attendance.[index-268_1.jpg][index-268_2.jpg]- 268 -The UTC’s inside was in keeping with its outside:oddly-shaped classrooms, out of sequence door-numbers. When Stephen pulled the door to the hallopen a crack, they realized that the talk was alreadyin progress. They quietly entered and took seatsnear the back.The slender woman had turned away from them,writing some dates on a chalkboard next to thelectern. When she turned back to look at heraudience, a sudden shiver went through Don; theresemblance was inescapable. He looked sharplyat Stephen and saw that he had caught it too.Don turned back to look at Marion Jones. Hedidn’t register anything she said yet. Thoughts wereracing through his brain, tumbling over one another.If she existed, then her husband existed, and thatmeant that Aquino’s story was true, and then allthat about the Ark and the Great Pyramid ...- 269 -He shook his head, took a deep breath. Not sofast. Might still be a coincidence. Maybe we’ll be ableto talk with her after the lecture. He tried to payattention to what the woman was saying.Marion Jones examined the chalk dates she hadwritten, and cleared her throat:“The story of Drake’s visit to Californiabegan in 1577. Up to then only FerdinandMagellan had successfully circumnavigatedthe globe, and Queen Elizabeth was lookingfor ways to boost English sailing prestigeagainst that of Spain. Also for some strongercolonial links and possibly some fattening ofher treasury in the bargain.“So she commissioned Drake, alreadywell-known as a resourceful seaman andsuccessful ambusher, to take five ships andsail around the world for the glory ofEngland. He was supposed to sign as manytreaties as possible with cultures he mightencounter en route, plunder any Spanishshipping that might be unfortunate enough toblunder into him, and try to find the fablednorthwest passage from the Pacific Ocean tothe North Atlantic.“Heading down the eastern coast of SouthAmerica towards Cape Horn, Drake managedto lose all but one of his ships throughaccident or refusal of the crews to continue.On his remaining vessel, the Golden Hinde,he headed up the Pacific coast, raided theports of Valparaiso and Callao de Lima, andseized a Panama-bound galleon carryingtreasure from Peru. He then continuednorthward, looking for the fabled ‘Straits of- 270 -Anian’ that would supposedly offer him ashortcut back to England.“Drake got as far north as what is todaythe coast of Oregon, whereupon what hecolorfully called ‘vile, thicke, and stinkingfogges’ forced him to turn around. Also theHinde was leaking, and he needed a place torest his crew and make repairs.“On June 17, 1579 he sailed into ‘a faireand good Baye’, spent 36 days repairing theleaking ship, treating with local MiwokIndians, and exploring the countryside. OnJuly 23 Drake sailed westward across thePacific, down through the Indian Ocean, andfinally back to England in September of 1580to a delighted Elizabeth, whereupon he wasknighted ‘Sir Francis’.“This all seems pretty straightforward,except that Drake’s log books, charts, andjournal of this spectacular journey promptlydisappeared into the Tower of London, neverto reappear. What we know of the voyage isonly through some secondary sources ofmaddeningly-imprecise references. Forinstance Richard Hakluyt’s 1589 work ThePrincipal Navigations, Voiages, andDiscoveries and the 1628 work The WorldEncompassed, published by Drake’s nephew.Both of these accounts were apparently basedon fragments of memoranda by one FrancisFletcher, preacher of the Hinde. But even themost pertinent parts of Fletcher’s papersseem to have been lost or destroyed upon theexpedition’s return to England in 1580.“Even more curiously, a strained tensionseems to have existed between the captain- 271 -and the cleric during the voyage. In theHarleian Manuscript, reprinted in Vaux’ 1854edition of The World Encompassed, Drake atone point ordered Fletcher chained to a hatchin the forecastle of the Hinde and cursed himin front of the whole crew: ‘Francis Fletcher, Ido here excommunicate thee out of theChurch of God, and from all the benefits andgraces thereof, and I denounce thee to theDevil and his angels.’ Drake then forced himto wear a sign on his arm: ‘Francis Fletcher,ye falsest knave that liveth’.“Drake’s ostensible reason for his voyagewas to circumnavigate the globe for the gloryof England, annoying the Spanish and ofcourse engaging in suitable land-claimingand opportunistic piracy along the way.Indeed he was so successful in theseincidental objectives that the Spanishambassador to England, Don BernadinMendoza, protested furiously to Elizabethupon Drake’s return. This, by the way, wasassumed to be the reason for the instantconcealment or destruction of Drake’srecords - but even after Mendoza’s departurefor Spain in 1583 the official silence persisted.After the destruction of the Spanish Armadain 1588, there was certainly no reason to befurther concerned about Spain, yet onlyfragments of records seemed to havesurvived.”Jones paused, sipped briefly from a glass ofwater on the lectern, surveyed her audience, andwalked down the stairs at the edge of the stage. She- 272 -paced slowly back and forth before the front row ofseats.“And now we come to the centralquestion: What took Drake up the west coastof the Americas almost all the way to what istoday the Canadian border? Supposedly hewas searching for another ‘northwest passage’to Europe - the rumored ‘Strait of Anian’. Buthe never took the Hinde far enough awayfrom the coast to conduct such a search.Rather he doubled back on his course,entered that ‘faire and good Baye’ near 38°Nlatitude - which we know today as SanFrancisco Bay - and encamped for thirty-sixdays at a site in the north bay which henamed ‘Nova Albion’. Supposedly this staywas to perform repairs on the Hinde fromstorm damage in the southern seas, thoughone wonders why he would have gone so farnorth to do this.“While based at Nova Albion, Drake madeat least one expedition into the land to thewest of his landing - toward where SanQuentin and San Rafael are today - and left acuriously-inscribed brass plate, which wasdiscovered on a hill overlooking the site in1936.“That plate resides today in a glass case atthe University of California’s BancroftLibrary. It remains our only clue to theseunanswered questions, and my research atthe Getty Museum will involve subjecting theplate to some of the latest techniques ofscientific analysis with this in mind.“Thank you - are there any questions?”- 273 -By unspoken agreement Stephen and Don waitedpatiently until the last of the audience had left thehall and Jones had returned to the stage to assembleher notes. Then Don, realizing that Stephen wasgoing to let him carry this particular ball, walkedhesitantly up to her. She glanced up at him.“Mrs. Jones? My name is Don Webb, and Ienjoyed your talk very much.”She nodded, smiled politely/impatiently. Webbsighed, then took the plunge.“I think we have some mutual friends inCalifornia - Dennis Mann and Karen Revay?”The smile vanished, replaced by a flicker ofsurprise and then a blank mask.Don continued: “I understand that you and yourhusband were involved in an archæologicalexpedition with them a few years ago ... to Germanyand then to Egypt.”Marion Jones still remained silent, but her eyesshifted to Stephen, who had joined them on thestage. Don nodded in his direction:“Mrs. Jones, Dr. Stephen Flowers, also -”“Flowers? The Stephen Flowers of the runebooks?”“The very same,” said Don smugly.“This is a pleasure,” said Marion. “Dr. Flowers,we have several of your books at home. My husbandHarry swears by them, says he can always tell in aminute when he comes across real archæologistblood. In contrast to all the stay-on-old-groundacademic armadillos.”“Thank you,” said Stephen with a slight bow.“Coming from him, that’s very nice to hear. I knowthe Manns too, and therefore something of yourhusband’s and your own, um, ‘breakthroughs’ in thefield.”- 274 -Marion laughed shortly. “There’ve been morethan a few of those. My back still hurts from the onein Tanis.”“Dennis and Karen haven’t been running aroundtalking about you,” Don broke in. “Another friend oftheirs, fellow named Aquino, wrote up an account oftheir trip with you, but everyone’s sure it’s just aprank of fiction. Stephen and myself too, frankly,until we walked in the door just now.”“What else could it be?” said Marion wryly.Who’d believe it? So buy me coffee - there is someplace around here, right? - and tell me what I can dofor you.”An hour later, at a small table in a cafe near thecampus, Marion had fielded the last of Stephen andDon’s questions concerning the events of Secret ofthe Lost Ark. And concerning her husband. “Indy’sback in North Carolina,” she said. “I’ll give you eachthree guesses.”Stephen caught it on the first try. “What he wastalking about in Berchtesgaden - the Grail.”“Bingo. That third Lucas movie got him going,got under his skin. His initial premise was that it -whatever it is, cup, stone, talisman - was secretedaway somewhere in central Europe, perhaps foundby Himmler’s Ahnenerbe expeditions and taken tothe Wewelsburg. Otto Rahn and so forth. Dead end.I mean, we found out lots of interesting tidbits aboutthe Wewelsburg and Ahnenerbe research, but it allwent off in other directions. Not the Grail.“Then Indy decided to take a shot at the variouslegends saying the Grail went to England, or wasfound in England. Remember, we’re not necessarilytalking about a Christian-cup thing, but an eventabout a so-far-unidentified object or artifact.- 275 -“But of course no Grail has surfaced anywhere inBritain - and not because the British themselveshaven’t taken an intense interest in that legend.”“Does this have anything to do with your work inCalifornia?” said Don. “With Drake?”“Bingo again. Indy’s researches in the BritishMuseum brought up some cryptic references in thepapers of Dee - John Dee - which might have beenabout the Grail. Personally I’m not holding mybreath; it’s pretty vague stuff, and Indy may bejumping to conclusions. Grail-on-the-brain, youknow.“Anyway, he noticed that before Drake left onthis voyage - the one that took him by California - hespent rather a lot of time with Dee, supposedly toconfer on the contents of Dee’s 1577 work ThePerfect Art of Navigation.“This was a time of considerable tension inEngland, because of the growing Spanish threat thatwould culminate a few years later in the GreatArmada.“Indy thinks that if the Grail existed as one of themost guarded and valued treasures of the monarchy,Elizabeth might have decided to send it out of thecountry to prevent its discovery in any Spanishinvasion. The Hinde’s odd detour to California hashim wondering whether Dee and Drake decided totake it - and hide it - there.“So when this job offer came along from Getty, Itook it to give him the benefit of the doubt. Gives meall the direct research access I need, for instance tothat very interesting brass plate. Meanwhile I don’tmind wintering in Santa Monica instead of NorthCarolina.”Stephen took a thoughtful sip of coffee, leanedback in his chair.- 276 -“Well, let me try out a thought of mine on you.From the slide of that plate you showed during yourlecture, its inscription - the letters, I mean - were allchiseled into the brass with angular cuts.”“That’s right. So?”“So a thin sheet of brass is not that difficult toengrave. So Drake, or one of his ship’s craftsmen,could have produced a more flowingly-inscribedartifact, something more suitable as a monument toElizabeth or England.”The ghost of a smile stole across Don’s face. “Ido believe I see where this is going.”Marion looked from one of them to the other.“Well, I sure don’t.”“Go ahead, Don.”“It was the Manns’ account of the events at theOakland base warehouse that gave me the clue. Theinscription hidden behind, or concealed within anapparent one.” Don turned to face Marion, hooked athumb in his friend’s direction. “Runes-on-the-brain. One of the emphases of Stephen’s books hasbeen the chiseling - the angled cuts. So you showhim a chiseled inscription that didn’t need to be,shouldn’t have been, he starts wondering ifsomething else is hiding in there. Am I right?”Stephen nodded. “But in answer to the questionyou’re about to ask, no, I don’t see anything fromthis slide, but it’s pretty superficial quality. I’d haveto take a more extensive look at the original fromthat premise.”“And then it’s not in the best shape,” saidMarion. “The plate sat in the bushes above Point SanQuentin for 354 years collecting seagull poop andteethmarks from passing raccoons.”“If you’re taking this back to a Drake-and-Deeconspiracy,” added Don, “then you’re going to have[index-277_1.jpg][index-277_2.jpg]- 277 -to consider the code angle too. Dee wrote much ofhis serious stuff in cipher.”Marion Jones sighed. “Great. I don’t suppose Icould coax the two of you into taking a trip toBerkeley with me, could I?”Don Webb rose and bowed. “Where theadvancement of science is concerned, how could wepossibly decline?”10:15 AM, Thursday, January 23, 1997; BancroftLibrary, University of California, Berkeley:The display case containing the brass platestared back at the three of them.“We’re going to need to take a look at it withoutthat glass in the way,” said Stephen.“The Getty already cleared the way for that,” saidMarion. “This afternoon in the lab. We’ve gotpermission to photograph it, and to touch it withsurgical gloves, but not to use any liquids on it, heat[index-278_1.jpg][index-278_2.jpg]- 278 -it, pick it up. Really. Someone from the Curator’soffice will probably be right there to peer over ourshoulders.”“That’s O.K.,” said Stephen. “I’m not looking foranything high-tech here. And obviously not on theback. But from what I can see already, we just mightbe on to something. Notice the ‘R’s, ‘B’s, ‘P’s? Thedoubling? And look at those ‘N’s. The ‘A’s, ‘Y’s, etc.are normally angled, but the ‘N’s are all crossbarred.Those are uruz-runes. Look at the ‘S’s; sowilo-runes.“Unless there are some faint strikeovers I can’tsee, that’s it. I really need an X-ray of the carvings.But my first guess is that we’re facing something incode, all right. The key has something to do with thenumber or placement of the runic symbols, andpossibly the doubled letters.”“I’ll check with the office. If we’re lucky, they’llhave X-ray prints somewhere in the files.”2 : 5 2 P M , T h u r s d a y , J a n u a r y 2 3 , 1 9 9 7 ;photographic laboratory, Department of Physics,University of California, Berkeley:- 279 -“What we’ve got here,” said Stephen, “is amixture of runes, black letter, and Roman letter. Forinstance, those ‘M’s and ‘N’s are what you’d find inChaucer, and the ‘D’s and certain other of the ‘N’s inthe Magna Charta. Then there are uniquemonograms, such as the superimposed ‘CG’ beforeDrake’s name, possibly standing for his rank of‘Captain General’.”“So are we left with the inscription as it is?” saidMarion.“Seems to me,” said Don, “that the mixture ofthese three writing devices suggests a code of somesort. Otherwise why mix them at all? Why not auniform style? And there’s something else thatjumps out at me. Notice that phrase ‘By the grace ofGod ...’?”The others looked at him blankly.“You may not know this,” continued Don, “butEnglish commoners of that day did not normallypresume to do anything ‘by the grace of God’. Youmight expect Elizabeth to have used such a phrase,but not Drake - who was not even knighted until hereturned to England following this voyage. Unlessthere were something in his action which he felt thedirect result of her command.”“Now that you mention it,” said Marion, “Inoticed something similar in Dee’s Perfect Art ofNavigation. It jumped out at me for much that samer e a s o n - t h a t i t s e e m e d s o o d d l y , w e l l ,presumptuous: ‘Then, By Gods grace, we may(comfortably) thus Answere this first Dowt, In thename of the whole Body Politicall.’”Stephen shrugged his shoulders. “This is all verytantalizing, but unfortunately I don’t see that we areany the closer to discovering a ‘hidden message’here, if indeed there is one. Let’s assume for the sake- 280 -of argument that Drake was using some kind ofcode - perhaps one of Dee’s, as we know he was aprize hog for codes and ciphers. But we’d have toknow which one of Dee’s codes Drake was using, tosay nothing of why.”“At least,” countered Don, “you’ll grant that itlooks as though something were coded here?”“I think we can go beyond ‘possibility’ to‘probability’,” said Marion. “But I fear Stephen’sright. Absent some kind of key, we’re at a dead-end.”“Perhaps,” mused Don, “we could approach itfrom the ‘other end’, so to speak. If Drake tooksomething - let’s be optimistic and suppose yourGrail - ashore to hide it, leaving the brass plate assome sort of coded guide to it ... O.K., we know thatthe English never came back here. They just foundedcolonies on the east coast, beginning with Roanokesome six years later, then Jamestown, then whatultimately became the famous Thirteen Colonies.But never back to Drake’s ‘Nova Albion’. I mean,here’s all of this virgin west coast - a major doorwayto the Asian trade markets - and the English wouldnot return to it. Smell a rat here?”“You’re saying,” said Marion, “that they wantedto rid themselves of the Grail permanently?”“If it’s the Grail,” broke in Stephen. “Remember,this could be something else entirely.”“Here I have to fall back on Indy’s research,” saidMarion. “Remember that he said that he’d found atrail to the English royal house and thence to Dee,just before Dee’s sudden, intensive round of secretconferences with Drake, just before this expeditionof Drake’s. And then it’s as though all trace of theGrail just vanished from English history entirely.”“Well then,” said Don, “Who came here next?”[index-281_1.jpg][index-281_2.png]- 281 -“That would have been the Spanish,” saidMarion. “The Russians didn’t make it down this farfrom the north. The Spanish California Missions.The first one in this area was the one in what wouldlater become San Francisco - San Francisco de Asís,founded in 1776.”“I thought it was called ‘Mission Dolores’,”countered Stephen.“No, that was sort of a nickname it got later on,”said Marion offhandedly. “Because of the blight ofillness and death and Indian desertions that hungover it for the next forty years ...” She stopped andstared at them. “You don’t just suppose -”- 282 -“- That they found it?” smiled Don. “And that itproved to be a dangerous discovery, as the Englishapparently had decided two hundred years earlier?”“Looks like your next stop is Mission Dolores,”chuckled Stephen. “Unfortunately I’m going to haveto go back to Texas at this point - got too many ironsin the fire back there, as usual.”Don looked glum. “And I can’t take more time offeither - I’ve got some lecture and interviewengagements in Los Angeles coming up at the turnof the month. And between now and then I’ve got tostop back by Austin and get ready for them.”“That’s O.K.,” said Marion. “If you hadn’t comeup here with me, I’d have no leads at all. Besides, ifthere’s any record at Dolores, it would probably be afairly straightforward kind of thing. I don’t figurethe padres writing in code! What I’m gambling onis simply that they might have left records of some‘device’ or ‘relic’ that would be significant to me, butobviously not to previous Mission historians.“But shoot, the Getty’s down in L.A. too, and I’llprobably have found either something or nothing bythe time you’re giving your lecture, Don. So I’ll justplan on seeing you there. Where’s it going to be?”“Place called ‘Hellhouse of Hollywood’,” saidDon. “No, really,” he added, seeing the look on herface, “it’s a quite respectable bookstore andmuseum. I mean, it’s - well, you’d really have to seeit for yourself.”Marion looked at him skeptically. “Why am Isuddenly getting that ‘here I go again’ feeling?” Hereyes suddenly twinkled. “Oh, all right. Can I bring aguest?”[index-283_1.jpg][index-283_2.jpg]- 283 -7:00 PM, Saturday, February 1, 1997; Hellhouse ofH o l l y w o o d , 6 6 6 6 H o l l y w o o d B o u l e v a r d ,Hollywood, California:It was Don Webb’s first visit to Hellhouse,though he had heard about it from the Schrecks andseen the photos they had sent him. But nothingquite prepared him for the reality. First, of course, itwas located right in the middle of the most volatilepart of Hollywood Boulevard - Frederick’s to oneside, the Scientologists to the other. Legions of thecrazed paraded up and down the sidewalk, someexcitedly, some in a daze, as though walking theBoulevard automatically sent one into ansomnambulistic trance. Maybe, thought Don, if youstay around here long enough, it becomes like the“Hotel California” song, and you can never get away,will just keep drifting back to endlessly wander the“Boulevard of Broken Dreams”.Hellhouse itself also defied easy descriptionwhen he walked into it. It was “sort of” a bookstore,“sort of” a museum, “sort of” an occult artifact shop- but all of these were mixed together in its single[index-284_1.jpg][index-284_2.jpg]- 284 -high-ceilinged hall. It was the kind of place to keep avisitor or browser “off balance”, he thought. Wonderhow people will handle my talk in a setting like this?Several rows of chairs had been arranged to facea Gothic-leering lectern, and Nikolas and ZeenaSchreck had begun to circulate among theassemblage, announcing the start of the lecture. Donwalked to the lectern and began to thumb throughhis notes, then jumped as a door behind him bangedshut.“Jesus,” said the man who had just bargedthrough it. “I thought I’d seen just about everybizarre thing on the planet, and now ChristopherLee’s showcasing me axe-murderers in the dark! Areyou sure - ?”“Indy,” hissed Marion Jones, “will you pleasejust shut up, sit down, and listen to the nice mantalk?”[index-285_1.jpg][index-285_2.jpg]- 285 -9:30 AM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; HamburgerHamlet, 6914 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood:Breakfast was already bad, thought Don. It wasbad because here he was, sitting across the tablefrom Indiana Jones - right below a giant mural ofHarrison Ford as Indiana Jones! This is a joke, andthe Schrecks - Don glowered at Nikolas, Zeena, andBob Moffatt - the others at the table - are in on ittoo, and all I can do is play along with it and wait tobe sucker-punched. But how could they get someonelike Harrison Ford to do this?Zeena, on the other hand, was enjoying herself.It had been she who had suggested the restaurant,and of course because of the mural - guessing justthe effect it would have. Across the ceiling a giganticSteven Spielberg examined them all critically,setting them up for the next scene in the movie. “So,Dr. Jones, what did you think of Hellhouse?” Zeenaasked brightly.- 286 -“It grows on you,” the man in the leather jacketadmitted to her. “First impression is just moreHollywood-shock; obviously you have to dosomething really extreme to get people’s attentionaround here -” he waved his hand in a circle “- butwhat you two put together does have a subtle cut ofelegance to it. The museum in the back - ‘Walk ofFire’, you call it? - is a case in point. First it just jarsyou. Then you start wondering why those particularexhibits, why the lighting effects, and of course whyall the trouble to get someone like Lee to narrate it.Then the sit-up-in-bed-later feeling that you werethe exhibit and they were the watchers.”Nikolas allowed himself a slow grin. “The ideawas never to just ‘open a shop’. What do you think,Don?”“I had a great time at Hellhouse. Everybodyseemed to like the lecture, and that made me feelgood too. But today - well, frankly I’ve never hadbreakfast with someone right out of a movie before -no offense, Dr. Jones - and I’m sort of trying to get agrip on this.”Indiana Jones smiled, glanced over his shoulderat the giant mural. “And yet isn’t it an interestingcommentary on human behavior that here I am, andthere that is, and we’re surrounded by peoplehere, and not one of them has noticed a damnthing? People see pretty much what they expect tosee,” he continued, “and the flip side of that is that ifyou see something you don’t expect, you have astrong tendency to blank it out, so to speak.”“You should be familiar with that, Don,” addedBob Moffatt. “I mean, in terms of your own stories,which often flip the reader back and forth betweenthe real and the surreal.”- 287 -Don sighed. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to soundnaïve about all this. I mean, I did talk to Dennis andKaren, and of course Stephen and I both met yourwife. It’s just that it’s somehow ‘all worse’ with youyourself here. And Zeena, I’ve decided I am goingto owe you one for the murals.”“Murals?” she asked in surprise. “Oh, thosemurals. But it isn’t really any worse than hunting the‘Holy Grail’, is it? Dr. Jones, you were going to tellus more about what your wife found.”The archæologist folded his hands together,looked at them all thoughtfully.“Marion went to that mission in San Francisco,spent a few days looking through faded Spanishmanuscripts about crops and Indian conversionsand so on. Then she found what was apparently alist of items being sent to the Pueblo of Los Angeleson one of the regular pack-trains that used to run upand down the mission chain. On the list was the‘English fire’ or ‘English light’ - something like that,she couldn’t be sure of the translation - andsomething like a prayer against harm or a cursewritten next to it. That was all. Today she’s down atthe Times archives, looking for anything interestingabout the Pueblo. I’ll phone her there at noon. In themeantime, I’d like to go over to the place and have alook around.”“We can drive you there right after breakfast,”said Zeena. “It’s not that far away. But I wouldn’t getmy hopes up. You’re not going to see anythingremotely resembling an original Spanish fort.”10:18 AM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; Avila Adobe,Olvera Street, El Pueblo de Los Angeles:[index-288_1.jpg][index-288_2.jpg]- 288 -“ R e c o n s t r u c t e d , ” s a i d J o n e s i r r i t a b l y .“Everything’s reconstructed - or just destroyed tomake that promenade outside. This adobe wasoriginally built in 1818, which is within that 40-yearwindow of the problems at the San Franciscomission, but it was just another residence, and not avery important one at that. We’ve no reasonwhatever to think that the, um, ‘object’ would havebeen brought here.”“The only other building here going back thatfar,” said Nikolas, “is the church across the market -‘Our Lady Queen of Angels’.If some sort of religious artifact were being senthere from the mission, wouldn’t it have been sentthere?”“If it had, it could scarcely have been kept asecret - or even preserved there this long, what withall the activity there.”“Churches have crypts and basements ...”suggested Zeena.“As it happens,” said Bob, “I can help you out abit there. Back in the, ahem, days of my youth when- 289 -I was studying for the Catholic priesthood, I spentquite a lot of time at this church, helping out withsome of their community and maintenance work.Indy’s right - almost. It’s pretty much a bare, simplebuilding.”“‘Almost’?” prompted Nikolas.Moffatt led them over to the window. “See thatbell tower to the left of the church? Below it is asmall cellar where we kept tools for grounds work.Over in one corner of the floor was a trap-door. Iremember it because when you see something likethat in a basement, it’s normally wood, usually toplumbing or utilities, you know. But this one wasiron, and from the looks of it quite old.”“What was under it?” said Zeena.“Don’t know - I never opened it up, never hadany reason to. I think I mentioned it to one of thepriests once, and he said that it was probably justaccess to some old sewer system. I gathered thatnone of them had ever thought it worth botheringwith.”“Time to call Marion,” said Jones, looking at hiswatch. “I’ll use the phone in the office over there.”“While he’s doing that,” said Don to Bob, “Let’sgo over to the church and see if the tower’s open andthe cellar still the way you remember it. Nikolas,Zeena - you wait for Dr. Jones, and let’s all meet atthose benches in the plaza park in twenty minutes orso.”10:56 AM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; The Plaza,beside the statue of Felipe de Neve, across from OurLady Queen of Angels Church, Olvera Street, ElPueblo de Los Angeles:- 290 -“Well, this is seriously strange,” said Jones.“Here’s what Marion just faxed over from the Timesarchives - a page from a book by Mike Marinaccinamed Mysterious California. Listen to this:Deep beneath the heart of Los Angeles’ financialdistrict, hundreds of feet below the huge downtownedifices that house banks, corporate offices, andgovernment agencies, lies another city rememberedonly in obscure Indian legends, an underground worldbuilt by a strange race that vanished five thousandyears ago.At least that’s what mining engineer W. WarrenShufelt claimed in the January 29, 1934 Los AngelesTimes. According to reporter Jean Bosquet, Shufeltwas ready to dig up downtown L.A. in search of thisancient subterranean civilization.Shufelt had first heard of the city in a Hopi legendabout “the Lizard People”. They were a fabled lost racewho had built thirteen great underground cities on thePacific Coast after a huge holocaust swept thesouthwest back around 3000 B.C. The subterraneansettlements were constructed to shelter the tribeagainst future disasters, and housed a thousandfamilies each, along with stockpiles of food. As thestory has it, they bored out the tunnels of theirsubsurface homes with a “chemical solution” thatmelted solid bedrock. Among other things, the LizardPeople possessed troves of golden tablets thatchronicled their race’s history, the origin ofhumankind, and the story of the world back tocreation.A Hopi chief told Shufelt that the vanished race’scapital city was located under present-day downtownLos Angeles. After surveying the area, Shufelt showedup on the Banning property at North Hill Street andsank a 350-foot shaft straight down, digging for whathe said was a “treasure room” directly underneath.Shufelt said he had located gold in the catacombsbelow with the aid of his “radio X-ray”.This peculiar instrument, which was a sort ofglorified dowsing pendulum, had also helped Shufeltmap the location and extent of the undergroundtunnels. He said that the subterranean city was shapedlike a giant lizard, with the tail tapering out beneath- 291 -the Central Library and the head in the vicinity ofChavez Ravine (now Dodger Stadium). The “key room”- the chamber that contained the map of the city andthe directory to the golden tablets - lay severalhundred feet under the present site of Times-MirrorSquare. Shufelt also claimed that he’d traced passagesstretching to the region around the SouthwestMuseum, and said that ventilation tunnels extendedwestward, opening at the Pacific Ocean.“And?” said Don.“And - nothing! There was nothing further inthe Times archives about Shufelt or his dig. If it hadturned out to be a hoax, you’d think there would atleast have been an editorial snicker about that. Butnothing at all. Marion looked up “tunnels” in theindex and did find some later passing mention ofsome odd tunnels underneath this part of town, butshe says they were apparently dismissed as the workof smugglers hiding illegal Chinese laborers in the19th Century.”“I don’t know,” said Nikolas doubtfully. “In theearly 1950s they dug up Chavez Ravine to buildDodger Stadium there. They would certainly havehad to dig pretty deep to lay the stadiumfoundations, yes? And apparently no Lizard Peopletunnels ...”“One of the lessons of archæology,” said Jones,“is that old locations and later maps or directions tothem rarely coincide. This fellow Shufelt might havebeen telling the truth about the Hopi legend, butwent off the track with some crazy ‘dowsing’ gadgetand wasted digging. But here come your friends ...So what did you two find?”“Nothing’s changed at all,” said Bob, easinghimself onto a bench. “The door to the bell tower’sopen, the little stairwell to the cellar too, and thetrapdoor’s still over there in the corner.”- 292 -“Better yet,” added Don, “we found a couple offlashlights and a Coleman lantern down there onone of the shelves. So what are we waiting for?”11:55 AM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; The bell towercellar, Our Lady Queen of Angels Church, OlveraStreet, El Pueblo de Los Angeles:“Whatever’s - hiding under - there - doesn’twant - to come out - without a fight!” panted Don asthe four men strained to raise the iron trapdoor.“Explains why nobody’s disturbed it before,”agreed Nikolas through gritted teeth.“It’s moving now,” said Bob - then with ascreech of protest from the ancient hinges, the hatchgave way; they jumped back as it swung over to hitthe floor behind them with a dull clang.“Phew!” said Zeena. “What a smell!”Jones winced his agreement. “At least we knowno one else has been down here for quite awhile.Bring the flashlights over, and let’s see what’s downthere.”The beams from the two flashlights playedthrough the dusty haze below, dimly illuminatedwhat appeared to be a subcellar of roughly the samesize as the room they were standing in. A woodenladder descended from the hatchway about twentyfeet to its dirt floor. Around the edges of thesubcellar were scattered haphazardly what appearedto be a number of old wooden boxes - too small to becoffins, Don decided with relief.“Bob, since you have some credentials aroundhere, I think it would be a good idea for you to goback to the bell tower door and keep an eye out,”said Jones. “Keep any wandering visitors away. If- 293 -someone official from the church shows up - well,just think of something.”Moffatt laughed. “‘It’s O.K., father, I just broughtsome friends by to dig up your cellar.’?”“Something like that. Say we’re from the gasdepartment checking a reported gas-leak.Whatever.”“O.K., ‘gas leak’ it is, but you’d better be ready toexplain the leather jacket and fedora instead of aSouthern California Edison uniform,” grinnedMoffatt, heading back up the stairs.Jones turned back to the others. “Don, you andNikolas go on down, take a look at those boxes.Better put on these gardening gloves so you don’t getcut on something. Zeena, see if you can get thatColeman going to pass down to them. I’ll keep aneye out from here in case we get company.”Don stuck one of the flashlights through his beltand gingerly began to descend the ladder. The woodfelt oddly light, with the whole ladder quivering eachtime he took another step down. Even morestrangely, as he reached the bottom, he felt anoticeable current of air flowing through the room.He played the flashlight over in its direction, saw acrude opening about the size of a large window cutinto the wall - then tumbled to the floor assomething heavy crashed against his shoulder.The ladder, apparently, was more decayed than ithad appeared at first glance. It had survived Don’sdescent, but as soon as Nikolas was about halfwaydown, the ancient wood had finally disintegrated,hurling him to the floor in a rain of rotten splintersand dust. Fortunately Don’s body had broken hisfall.“I’m all right,” said Nikolas as Don helped himup, then called up to the two anxious faces above:- 294 -“We’re going to need another ladder, or a rope, toget out of here.”“I’ll go find something,” answered Jones.“There’s some clothesline here, but it’s too thin foryou to climb.”“I can lower the Coleman with it anyway,” saidZeena. “Are you sure you’re both O.K.?”“Nothing busted,” answered Don, gingerlymassaging his shoulder. “Just reminds me why Inever took to football.” He reached out for theColeman coming down on the clothesline, then heldit up for a better look around the subcellar. Nikolaswas already examining the boxes; after four or fiveimpatient mumbles, he suddenly beckoned Donover.“Bring the lantern closer; look at this!”Jammed between two of the wooden cases waswhat seemed to be the remains of a leather box,about two feet square, mostly disintegrated,retaining its shape only because of two vertical andtwo horizontal bands of some heavily-corrodedmetal, perhaps badly-tarnished brass or copper.“Look there,” pointed Nikolas, “at the mark on thetop band.”“I’ll be damned,” said Don - then got up andwalked back over to stand to directly beneath thehatchway above: “Zeena, there’s a case down herewith the same kind of writing on it that I saw on theDrake brass plate. Can’t make it out - it’s toocorroded. But lower the line, and we’ll send it up.Maybe Indy can make something of it.”When they gingerly picked the remains of thebox up, they noticed a small parchment roll,evidently somewhat newer than the leather, sittinginside on the base, which was completely of thecorroded metal. Fearing it might also be near- 295 -disintegration, they left it untouched, but told Zeenato bring it to Jones’ attention.“I can’t understand why he hasn’t come backyet,” said Zeena with some irritation. Then sheturned to see Bob Moffatt coming quickly down thesteps.“A problem,” he said. “The kind we werelaughing about over breakfast. Jones was headedback across the plaza with a ladder, and I guess thatattracted some attention. Then some kids looked athim too closely, and now there’s a crowd aroundhim cheering and waving. They obviously think he’sHarrison Ford.”Zeena rolled her eyes in exasperation. “Oh, forChrist’s sake!”“The Christ part comes next,” said Bob. “Themass has just let out, and there are people from thechurch all around here. Notice the time?” - heshowed her his watch - “It’s almost noon. Thatmeans -”“- Someone’s going to be coming here to ring thedamned bells, right?”“Right. So we’re going to have to get out of herenow.”Moffatt turned to call down through the opening.“Don? Nikolas? I’m going to have to shut this dooruntil we’re sure that everyone’s away from the belltower again. It may be awhile, hours, I don’t know.But we will be back to get you out of there.”Not pausing for an answer, he then levered theiron hatch back over on its hinges, until it againslammed shut with a boom that echoed through theroom below.Don looked glumly at Nikolas. “Why does thisremind me of the Well of Souls scene in Raiders ofthe Lost Ark?”- 296 -“No snakes this time,” said Nikolas helpfully.“On the other hand, no giant statues to breakthrough the walls with either. But rather than justsitting here until evening, or tomorrow morning,let’s take a look through that hole in the wall, do alittle exploring. After that lizard city story, I’mwondering whether this is just old Spanish work, orsomething else.”The two of them walked over to the darkenedaperture and directed the flashlights through it. Thebeams disappeared into the distance of what seemedto be a tunnel bored through the earth and rockbeyond. As far as they could see, it was completelyempty.“You get the Coleman,” said Don. “Let’s keep theflashlights off to save the batteries.” He pulled asmall notebook from his pocket and tore a page outof it. “I’ll leave a note right below the trapdoor to tellthem where we’ve gone.”“How far do you think this leads?”“Only one way to find out!”Far above them they heard the church bells beginto ring.12:27 PM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; a taxicab,northbound, the Hollywood Freeway, near theSunset Boulevard offramp:“Of all the rotten, lousy luck,” snarled IndianaJones.Bob Moffatt patted his shoulder. “Most people inthis town would be overjoyed to be mistaken for amovie star.”Jones glared at him. “It isn’t funny. And this isn’tthe first time either. Marion and I were almosttrampled to death one time in Tokyo.”- 297 -Bob wasn’t fazed. “Everyone’s almost beentrampled to death in Tokyo. All you have to do isride the subway. Besides, why do you keep wearingthat hat and jacket?”“Bob does have a point,” commented Zeena.Jones sighed. “Touché. But you have tounderstand - they’ve been with me my whole life.I’ve been around the world in them. Maybe I’msuperstitious, maybe just sentimental. My bigmistake was telling George and Steven, because thenthey just had to make them a trademark of thefilms.”“At least we’re away from the crowd now,” saidZeena. “Bob, how soon do you think we can go backto the tower?”“Nothing happens there except the bell-ringing.That’s on the hour, of course. It wasn’t automatedwhen I worked around there, and I didn’t see anysign that anything’s changed now. I’d say thisafternoon’s cutting it too close; some of the peoplewho saw Indy may still be hanging around thesquare. I’d recommend we wait to just after 7 PM.Then people will be drifting away to home, and it’sstill too early for any of the evening service crowd tobe around the church.”“But that means Nikolas and Don will be stuckdown there for seven hours!”“Nothing’s going to happen to them exceptboredom,” said Jones, “but Bob’s right, I’m afraid. Ifwe go back earlier, we might blow the whole thing -not to mention having to explain to the church andmaybe the cops what we were doing down in theirbasement!”3:45 PM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; somewhereunder Los Angeles:- 298 -The initial tunnel, they discovered, was only ashort branch off a somewhat larger one about fivehundred yards along it. That main tunnel - as far asthey could see as bare as the branch one - appearedto extend in a generally-straight line in angles to [asnear as they could determine] the northeast andsouthwest. Don tore another page out of hisnotebook. “Right or left?”“Do you feel the current of air?”“I think so ... yes. From the southwest. And itsmells fresh.”“Then that’s our direction. It’s got to bring us outto the surface somewhere.”As they made their way down the main tunnel,their original hopes of coming upon some water-main or manhole-access to the surface began tofade. This was no ordinary piece of excavation. Thebottom was smooth enough - perhaps a little toosmooth, thought Don - but the sides were, well,melted rather than cut or bored. And the sidewallswere angled slightly, irregularly inward, as thoughwhoever had created this passage were indifferent toits dimensions beyond the wide, smooth groundsurface.But the current of air persisted, and felt strongeras they continued down the tunnel, occasionallypassing other apparent-branch openings to theirright or left.“No lizards yet,” said Don, just to break thesilence.“Or gold,” returned Nikolas. “But this might notbe part of Stufelt’s lizard city at all. On the otherhand, it’s just as obviously not part of the L.A. sewersystem, and for that I am frankly grateful! What’sleft? Storm drain to the ocean? Not if there’s abranch from beneath that bell tower. Smuggling- 299 -route? Then you’d think we’d find some sign ofpeople having been here. But it’s absolutely empty.I’ve never seen anything quite like it before.”“I don’t think you’re going to see anything like itfor very much longer either,” commented Don,looking at the Coleman. “Looks like we’re about outof gas. When this goes, I vote we just turn aroundand head back to the bell tower. We can use just oneof the flashlights at a time, and that should beenough to get us back at least. Then we just sit in thedark and wait.”“Sounds reasonable,” agreed Nikolas, “andtimely, because there goes the lantern.”They halted and watched while the glow from theColeman began to fade, then winked out altogether,leaving them in an inklike darkness. Nikolasswitched on his flashlight, saw Don staring down thetunnel before them.“Nikolas, maybe I’ve been down here too long,but when the light went out, I thought I could seesomething in the distance. Turn the flash off for amoment, will you?”Nikolas obligingly did so, also peering in thedirection indicated by Don. Then he could see it too:a faint glimmer of light from something in theceiling, perhaps fifty yards further down the tunnel.They both switched on their flashlights and rantowards it.When they reached the source of theillumination, they found it to be an irregular panelin the ceiling above them, slightly dislodged from itsapparent setting. Had it been properly seated,commented Don, they probably would never haveseen it at all.“Which makes me wonder how many of them wemight already have passed by in the tunnel,” said- 300 -Nikolas. “Particularly with the lantern on, wewouldn’t have seen any of them.”“Well, I suggest we have a go at this oneanyway,” said Don. “You get up on my shoulders,brace yourself against the walls, and see if you canget up through it.”Climbing up on someone else’s shoulders in suchnarrow quarters turned out to be not as easy as itmight seem. After a somewhat precarious success,Nikolas was able to reach up to the dislodged panel,knock it to one side on what was apparently asurface above, then grip the edges and haul himselfthrough the opening. He turned on the flashlight,looked around, and let out a sharp hiss of shock.Don’s voice came up from below: “Nikolas, whatis it? Are you all right?”“Don, I’m O.K. It’s just what’s up here. I - there’sa rope ladder here. I’m going to drop it. Just keepyour cool when you get up.”Webb hurried up the ladder in puzzlement, thenstared through the opening at the top at a scene ofstark horror.The roughly-cut room they found themselves inwas also irregularly cut, but perhaps thirty to fortyfeet at its greatest length. But scattered throughoutit were pieces of what had once been humanremains, sliced through as though with a butcherknife or saw, and all curiously wrinkled andshrunken.“What is it?” gasped Don. “What happenedhere?”Nikolas’ normally-measured voice was shaken. “Idon’t think it was recent. These bodies don’t look asthough they’ve been disturbed for years - decades.Also, did you notice, there’s not a bloodstain- 301 -anywhere. Someone or something drained all theblood from these before throwing them in here.”Don closed his eyes momentarily to blank it allout, then remembered: “We’re looking for a way out.Do you see anything?”“No - yes! Over there on that wall ... rungs, Ithink. Maybe there’s some kind of access to thesurface? Let’s try it.”“Nikolas, if there is an opening up there, becareful. What’s above us could have someconnection with - all this.”5:10 PM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; a backstreetalley, Leimert Park, Los Angeles:A piece of weed-covered ground trembled, thenmoved upward as the hatch underlying it slowlyrotated open. After a moment two dust-coveredfigures dragged themselves up through the opening,rolling over onto the dirt of the alley beside it. Forperhaps five minutes they both remained that way,silent, unmoving. Then, unsteadily, they stood up.One paused to kick the hatch closed again, then theybegan to walk towards the street a short distanceaway. Blinking in the fading afternoon sunlight, theysaw a gas station at the corner, and in its driveway apay phone. Nikolas fished out a coin, dialed hishome number. “Zeena?”“Nikolas? Nikolas! You got out? Are you allright? Where are you?”“We’re both fine. Yes, we got out. There was atunnel out of there, a long one. We’ll tell you allabout it later. Right now we just pick us up.”“Where are you? I’ll be right there.”“There’s a street sign ... I’ll be damned!”“Nikolas?”[index-302_1.jpg][index-302_2.jpg][index-302_3.jpg][index-302_4.png]- 302 -“Zeena, we’re at 39th and Norton.”8:10 PM, Sunday, February 2, 1997; Cherub Room,Magic Castle, 7001 Franklin Avenue, Hollywood:[index-303_1.jpg][index-303_2.png]- 303 -“I needed that,” said Don Webb with a contentedsigh, rocking his chair back. “What a great dinner!Until I hit the festelboard, I’d forgotten that none ofus had any lunch today.”“Well, we were sort of busy,” remarked IndianaJones.“All the more reason we need a relaxing eveninghere without thinking more about it right now,”said Zeena with a sharp look at him. “No more shoptalk tonight, remember? Agreed? Now let’s relax anddo the shows.”“I’m for that,” agreed Nikolas. “Too bad Bob hadto beg off this evening. If it hadn’t been for himtoday -”“No more shop talk, Nikolas?”“All right, dear.”10:20 AM, Monday, February 3, 1997; lounge area,main lobby, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel,Hollywood Boulevard:- 304 -“So Dr. Jones is off to the Getty with that trinketthis morning,” said Don to the Schrecks. “Frankly Ican use the breather. He’s a nice guy, but he gets onmy nerves after awhile. By the way, why did you getme a room in this particular place?”Zeena beamed at him. “Because it’s haunted, ofcourse. The Roosevelt is supposed to have moreghosts per capita than any other place inHollywood. We felt it was the least we could do tokeep up images - yours, ours, and theirs, I mean.”“I did have a little problem with the big mirroracross the room last night,” acknowledged Don. “Itstayed lit for awhile after I turned the lights out. ButI figured it was merely because of yesterday.”“Lit?” queried Nikolas. “Lit how?”“As though there were a light on at the back ofthe room which reflected in the mirror. But therewas no light on in the room, and nothing from thewindow which would have hit the mirror.”“I’d say that’s normal Roosevelt,” said Zeena.“You get special points only if a dead movie starsteps out of the mirror - Barrymore, Marilyn, Mix,Rin Tin Tin, whoever.”“It was enough for me after yesterday afternoon,”said Don. “But, Nikolas, you were going to tell mewhat got you so spooked about coming out of thetunnel system at that particular location.”“A lot near 39th and Norton was where the bodyof the Black Dahlia was found in January 1947,” saidNikolas. Seeing Don’s curiosity, he continued:“That was the nickname of a young womannamed Elizabeth Short - one of the Hollywoodstarlet-hopeful types who survived on temporaryjobs and the generosity of various boyfriends, butnot anything like a prostitute. She was last seenJanuary 9th at the Hollywood Biltmore, then just- 305 -vanished. Six days later her body was discovered inthe lot - cut completely in half, savagely mutilated,many of her organs gone, and completely drained ofblood. One of the exhibits in our museum -”“I saw it,” said Don. “Unsolved?”“That’s right. The usual parade of derangedconfessors after it became a media event, butnothing at all conclusive. So after the LAPD droppedit as an impossible investigation, it became one ofthe legends of Los Angeles folklore. James Ellroywrote a bestselling novel about it in ‘87; a mannamed John Gilmore followed it up with a bookcalled Severed in ‘94 - purporting to solve themurder. But it’s still only speculation. I understandthere’s going to be a big-budget movie about it soon- probably because of the successful filming ofEllroy’s L.A. Confidential. If so, you can expectanother rash of Dahlia-fever.”“The nickname resulted from an old Alan Laddfilm The Blue Dahlia,” added Zeena. “ElizabethShort had jet-black hair and liked to dress in black,so around her social haunts she became known asthe Black Dahlia. You can see how a nickname likethat would have fed the sensationalism.”“So what we saw yesterday ...” said Donthoughtfully. “Back then everyone was lookingaround the area, but apparently no one consideredlooking underneath it.”“That’s right,” said Nikolas. “Short must havebeen butchered in that same underground room,just like those others. Why her body was the onlyone thrown up onto the surface of the lot I don’tsuppose we’ll ever know. Or who or what wasresponsible for the killings.”“So what do we do about this?”- 306 -“Zeena and I discussed that last night. As far as Iknow, there’s no trace of our having been there - wewere wearing those gloves the whole time,remember - and we’d really rather not have to dealwith another round of crazy conspiracy lunatics.Can’t you see it? Particularly with that Dahlia exhibitin Hellhouse? So this morning we made ananonymous call to the LAPD from a payphone andtold them about the trapdoor in the alley. Now it’sup to them to follow it up or not.”“Did you say anything about the church cellar?”“No, because I can’t see that there’s any directconnection. That tunnel system obviously goes allover the place down there. The branch below thechurch just happened to lead into a main route thattook us by that particular room and its exit. Myguess is that the iron hatch in the church cellar willgo right back to being ignored and unopened foranother hundred years or so.”“Anyway, Don,” said Zeena, “as interesting asthis has all been, Nikolas and I are going to have tobow out here. We’ve got the final work on thatChristopher Lee CD to finish up with him, and thestore, and the Internet mail-order side of it that’salso starting up. We can’t let it go any longer.”“Don’t tell me,” sighed Don. “The lecture herewas just one of several I have to do for Seven Facesof Darkness, and my publisher in Denver’s after meto get the final proofs of Stealing my Rules to him.And I talked with Rosemary on the phone thismorning, and Seven Faces is bringing in anavalanche of inquiries and interview requests. Sowhat am I doing? Chasing after what might be theHoly Grail with a movie star who isn’t really thecharacter - the other way around, I mean! - runningthrough the L.A. lizard underground, and now this- 307 -Dahlia business. Do you know how that sounded onthe phone? Rosemary would think I’d gone over thetop except that Stephen backed me up on theMarion-and-Drake business. And apparently she’shad another chat with the Manns as well.”“So are you going to call it quits and go back toTexas?”“Jones said he’d phone me later this morningfrom the Getty, after he and Marion get throughlooking at that old container. If that’s what Drakeburied near San Quentin, I guess that’s the end ofthe trail, because whatever it contained - if itcontained something - is obviously gone. But I’d liketo know anyway. So I’ll just wait around here untilhe calls, then catch a hotel shuttle to the airport.”He stood up and embraced each of them warmly.“Thank you both for everything - the evening atHellhouse, your hospitality, last night at the Castle;it’s been a wonderful visit. As for the other stuffyesterday, I’m just going to try not to think about itany more. I already have my quota of regularnightmares to keep me company.”2:30 PM, Monday, February 3, 1997; home of PattyHardy and Andrew Nourse, San Franciscopeninsula hills, California:“Andy! How’d you like to take a quick trip toLompoc?”Nourse’s head emerged from the door to theirliving room, focused in on Patty Hardy’s in thekitchen. “Lompoc? What’s happening in Lompoc?For that matter, where is Lompoc?”“Remember that phone call about an hour agofrom Don? Don Webb?”“Yes - Did he make it back home safely?”- 308 -“He never went home. He’s still in Los Angeles.Apparently there was something going on that hedidn’t want to talk about on the phone. But when hecalled, he said he’d just been given someastronomical coordinates from the year 1812, and hewondered if I could pinpoint a location to go alongwith them.”“And you got Lompoc?”“Right. That’s a town down the coast near PointConception, near Vandenberg Air Force Base. I justcalled Don back and told him about it, and hesounded quite excited. Said there’s one of the oldSpanish missions there - La Purisima - and he’sgoing to drive up there this afternoon with a friendof his. He asked whether you and I could meet themthere, so I took a chance and said yes.”“I’m ready!”5:10 PM, Monday, February 3, 1997; home ofDennis Mann and Karen Revay, near SantaBarbara, California:“That’s marvelous!” said a delighted DennisMann to their two surprise dinner guests. “What agreat story! Do you really think it’s the real Grail?”[He wouldn’t think it was so great if I’d told himabout the tunnels, thought Don.]“That we won’t know until we find it, whatever itis, if it’s up at the Purisima Mission,” said IndianaJones after another swallow of coffee. “We’ve chasedthis thing from the Continent to England to SanFrancisco to Los Angeles and now up to thatMission. We’re now talking 1812. That’s almost twohundred years for it to have moved somewhere else.All we know for certain is that the trail’s taken usthis far.”- 309 -Karen Revay walked in from the kitchenbalancing four dessert plates of berry pie. “Here yougo, guys - fresh out of the oven. So, Don. Still thinkthat Secret of the Lost Ark story was all fluff?”Don laughed. “Theoretically I stopped thinkingthat the moment Stephen and I walked in onMarion’s lecture in Austin, I guess. But emotionallyit took a little longer. This isn’t your usual kind ofencounter. But I don’t have to tell you two that, doI?”Dennis shook his head. “We didn’t say anythingabout it originally. Who’d have believed us? ThenMichael wrote that story, and of course some peoplewho read it asked us about it. Still what were wegoing to say? That yes, we were looting old Armywarehouses in Oakland, running through secret Nazitunnels on the Obersalzberg, breaking into Hitler’sfireplace at the Eagle’s Nest, fighting off MOSSAD,going down more secret Egyptian tunnels in theGreat Pyramid? I don’t think so.”“Sometimes,” agreed Karen, “you just filesomething away as a remarkable part of yourpersonal life experience and let it go at that.”“Aw, come on,” protested Indiana Jones. “Whendid you ever have a summer vacation like that one?”Karen looked at him. “I guess you’ve got a pointthere. But I think once was enough. I think Iremember you saying something about the Grailwhile we were in Germany, though, so I’m notsurprised you’re after it. But who’d have thoughthere, now?”Dennis held up his glass. “Welcome to the club,Don. Even if you don’t find it, now you can spendthe next few years answering the kinds of questionswe’ve been getting. Particularly if Michael finds- 310 -out about what you’ve been doing and writes it all upagain.”“This one he isn’t going to hear about,” saidDon firmly. “I don’t know how I’d begin to explainany of it to anyone, and I really don’t want to evenhave to try.”Jones looked at his watch. “That was a greatdinner, Karen, but I think we’d better be going if wewant to reach Lompoc before dark.”“Think of it, Karen,” said Dennis. “All that timewe lived in Lompoc and we were right on top of theHoly Grail. In Lompoc! You two will see what Imean when you get there. You’re thinking a castlefrom a Wagner opera; well, Lompoc is at the otherend of the scale.”“Got that right,” said Karen. “Anyway watchyourself, Don. This character” - she nodded at thegrinning archæologist - “seems to find all thewrong kind of interesting things.”Don’s thoughts crept back to 39th and Norton.He decided that he agreed with her.8:45 PM, Monday, February 3, 1997; EmbassySuites Hotel, 1117 North “H” Street, Lompoc,California:Patty Hardy and Andrew Nourse were havingcoffee in the restaurant when Don Webb andIndiana Jones walked in. Patty waved them over;Andy jumped to his feet and gave Don a friendlyhug.“Harrison Ford!” said Patty, shaking hands withthe archæologist. “What a nice surprise! No wonderyou were being so cagey over the phone, Don.”“Ms. Hardy,” said Jones awkwardly, “I know Ilook like him, but I’m not Harrison. I’m -”- 311 -Andy broke in: “It’s the other way around, right?That story about Dennis and Karen?”Don nodded, deadpan. “May I introduce Dr.Harry Jones from the University of North Carolina.”“Well, sit down, sit down!” said Patty. “This isgreat! So the story wasn’t a fake after all. Who’dhave thought it? Now what brings you here, to thosecoordinates you phoned about?”“Ms. Hardy,” said Jones, “I’m on the trail of an,an artifact that was apparently brought to Californiaby Sir Francis Drake, then found by the Spanish andsent first to their Pueblo at Los Angeles, then here.I’m still not sure what it was, but I think ...”“You think it’s the Holy Grail, don’t you?” saidAndy smugly.“It might be,” said Don, “but honestly we haven’tseen anything actually describing it that way, oreven describing it, whatever it is, at all. All we knowis that the English seemed to be very anxious to hidethis thing, first in England itself, then to get it out ofthe country as far away as they could before theSpanish Armada was ready to threaten invasion.Then the thing was apparently found by the Spanishhere two hundred years later, and seems to havebeen something of a hot potato. They sent it awayfrom the San Francisco Mission - not to one of thesouthern Missions, but to the Pueblo militaryoutpost. The case that contained it turned up in anold storage room under a church built there later,but in the meantime the thing had been sent awayagain, according to a note left with the case.”“And that was all the more curious,” said Jones,“because the letter didn’t identify where the objectwas being sent - just gave those astronomicalnavigation coordinates. We’d have been at a deadend, except that Don remembered your computer[index-312_1.jpg][index-312_2.jpg]- 312 -work with ancient astronomy and took a chance onyour being able to dial the skies back and give us aplace on the map.”“So it must have been the Mission here,” saidDon. “Misión la Purisima Concepción de MaríaSantísima, to be exact. It’s just north of the town.Let’s go there first thing in the morning and check itout.”11:45 AM, Tuesday, February 4, 1997; La PurisimaMission State Historical Monument, near Lompoc,California:“One end of the place to the other,” said Jones,taking off his hat and wiping his brow, “and nothingunusual that I can see.”“Dr. Jones,” said Patty, “there was one thing thatstruck me as curious. But I’m not an expert onMissions ...”When he nodded, she continued: “It was in thechapel. I’m accustomed to seeing all sorts of gravesof priests and notables in Catholic churches and- 313 -chapels. But in this one there was only one grave,up by the altar.”“Go on,” said Jones with interest.“The way I see it, that could mean one of twothings: Either the person buried there wasexceptionally highly regarded, in which case it wasan honor, or it might be that he was - not highlyregarded, in which case his placement there mighthave been for spiritual protection of the Mission.That would also account for no one else being buriedanywhere around him.”“Or maybe the grave is not that of a person at all,but is perhaps a blind?” suggested Don.“Hopefully we’ll know more in a minute,” saidPatty. “Here comes Andy. I asked him to go to theMission’s library and see what he could find outabout that particular tomb.”Andy Nourse came up to them, out of breath andobviously excited. “You’re going to love this! Butafter I tell you about the tomb, I learned somethingeven more interesting - I’ll get to that later.“That’s the grave of the fellow who was thepastor here at the time you were interested in - 1812.Fray Mariano Payeras. Seems he kicked the bucketin 1823. But here’s the strange part. When theywere restoring this Mission much later, and gotaround to the chapel, they exhumed him. Knowwhat they found? Just his top half! The body hadbeen cut in two at the middle before burial.”“Did they ever find out what happened?” saidPatty.“Well, sort of. Payeras’ lower torso and legs werelater discovered at Mission Santa Barbara, sixtymiles away to the south. So then he was reburied inone place, that’s what’s here in the chapel. I don’t- 314 -know if he was stitched together first or not. Whywould anyone cut a dead person in half, anyway?”The image of Elizabeth Short crawled back intoDon’s mind. But no, he thought, there couldn’t beany connection. This was 1823, that was 1947. Butthe coincidence gnawed uneasily at him.“In medieval times that was one of the ways ofdealing with vampires and other kinds of unpleasantposthumous monsters,” observed Patty. “You stakedthem, burned them, or dismembered them; andpresumably that made it more difficult for them toget up and stagger off to the nearest village. Whatkind of a person was Payeras?”Andy shrugged. “Actually he seems to have beencloser to a saint than a vampire. Arrived here in1804, apparently with considerable knowledge offarming and irrigation, because the Mission’s cropproduction and water supply both grew steadilyunder his direction. He even helped the Mission tosurvive smallpox and measles epidemics a couple ofyears later. The trouble happened in - guess when?”“How about 1812?” said Don.Andy nodded. “What they called here el año delos temblores, ‘the year of the earthquakes’. On - getthis - the South Solstice, December 21 of thatyear, the Mission was suddenly and completelydestroyed by a massive earthquake. The chapel waspulverized instantly, and all the other buildingsbroken open. That was followed by several days ofviolent rainstorms, which disintegrated all of theexposed adobe. The earthquake also opened a giantfault rift right under the original site.”Jones swept his hand around at the Missionbuildings behind them. “I don’t understand. This isall fairly recent reconstruction - early part of thiscentury, at least.”[index-315_1.jpg][index-315_2.png]- 315 -“I was getting to that. This isn’t the site of theoriginal Mission! That was about four milessouthwest of here, below the Santa Ynez River. Andduring the floods right after the earthquake, out ofthat fissure erupted waves of ‘black sand’. Thatfreaked the Indians, who regarded it as the worstpossible kind of curse, and they refused to goanywhere near the ruins. That’s why Payeras cameup here to rebuild.”“And then?” said Don. “Up here everything wentO.K.?”Andy shook his head. “Only up to the time ofPayeras’ death in 1823. As I said, he seems to havebeen an unusually strong, inspirational leader.Maybe that’s why the people in Los Angeles sentyour gizmo to him for safekeeping? But after hedied, it all came apart. Less than a year later theIndians revolted and took over the Mission. TheSpanish promptly sent a military force up here and- 316 -recaptured it, then executed some and imprisonedseveral others of the Indians. It was touch and goafter that, as you can imagine. The Mission wasfinally secularized in 1834, and shortly thereafterabandoned entirely. Around the turn of the centurythe land was acquired by the Union Oil Company,which later deeded it over to the State of Californiaas a historic site. What you see here is a completerestoration done mostly by the CCC in the 1930s.That’s also when the grave of Payeras wasaccidentally discovered, and when, er, all of him wasreinterred in the present grave in the chapel.“One thing more: This is the only Mission in theentire chain that the Catholic Church washed itshands of. All the others remain consecratedchurches. Just not this one.”“Just thinking out loud here,” said Don. “But ourartifact comes up here in 1812, let’s say to besafeguarded by this super-saintly padre. But insteadit destroys the entire Mission, so much so that noone will come near it and Payeras has to rebuildsome distance away. But there’s still an atmosphereof, call it ‘contamination’, and as soon as Payeras isno longer around to counteract it, the secondMission self-destructs too. Then the Catholic Churchwipes it off their books entirely. If the state hadn’ttaken an interest in it and rebuilt it for a park, itw o u l d n o w b e v i r t u a l l y u n k n o w n a n dunremembered.”“That’s some artifact, all right,” said Jones. “Let’shead for that original site and see what there is tosee.”“Lunch first,” insisted Patty. “Not all of usmetabolize adrenalin, you know.”[index-317_1.jpg][index-317_2.jpg]- 317 -2:15 PM, Tuesday, February 4, 1997; overgrownearthquake fissure near the Santa Ynez River, fourmiles southwest of Mission La Purisima, Lompoc,California:“As near as I can tell from those maps at the newMission,” said Jones, “we’re now standing right overPayeras’ original chapel building site.Looks to me as though all the interest inrestoration was focused on the new site up to thenorth - good! Now we look for any remnant of thatstructure, or something that might have been underit, perhaps.”The four of them fanned out among the rocksand underbrush. The afternoon sun gave themplenty of light to examine the terrain with, but thePacific breezes from off Point Conception kept theday pleasantly cool. As he clambered around therocks, Don decided he was enjoying himself on thisbizarre treasure hunt, even if they didn’t findanything more than more rocks. But then he did.As he clambered around one large boulder, hisgaze fell on an elongated crack between its edge andthe ground next to it. What caught his eye was that[index-318_1.jpg][index-318_2.png]- 318 -the edge of the crack was not jagged, but straight.Trying not to get his hopes up, he called to theothers, who came plunging through the brush toexamine his discovery.Jones’ excitement was electric. “O.K., let’s try toget this rock off that opening. Don, get the jack-handle from the trunk of the car, will you? Andy,you by any chance have another one in yours? Good- we’ll need that too.”With all of them straining on the steel barswedged under the boulder, they were able to roll itfurther off the opening. Catching their breath, theygathered round to see what they had uncovered.It was rectangular, adobe, with what seemed likea step barely visible at one end of it. The rest of thestairwell, if that’s what it were, was completely filledwith dirt and rock fragments.[index-319_1.jpg][index-319_2.png]- 319 -“This is going to take some digging,” said Jonesunnecessarily. “We’ll have to go back into town andbuy some shovels and, I think, a pick. Also a coupleof lantern-lights, in case there’s anything down thereto see once we open it up.”11 AM, Wednesday, February 5, 1997; entrance tothe chapel crypt, Mission Vieja:“That should about do it,” said Jones, droppinghis shovel. “Don, you found it - you lead the way!”Don switched on one of the lanterns and slowlydescended the cramped staircase. With the pick hehacked away at the remaining rubble at the bottom,breaking through it into an open space beyond. Hewidened the opening another few feet, then steppedcautiously through it and directed the electric beamout before him. After the bright sunlight outside, ittook his eyes time to register his surroundings.[index-320_1.jpg][index-320_2.png]- 320 -He was standing in the remains of what had oncebeen a long, low crypt. Part of the sides had cavedin, evidently from the earthquake, and areas of theceiling sagged ominously. “Come on down. Look atthis!”The other three filed down through the narrowentrance to join him.Wordlessly he pointed the beam of light at thefar end of the room.And there It was.Sitting atop a raised earthen platform, aboutthree feet above the floor, was what at first glance- 321 -seemed to be a cup or goblet tapering down to a thinstem, which then flared out to a wide, flat base.But that is where the similarity ended. Becausethe thing flowed, or oozed. As they came closer to it,the saw that it appeared to be made of somemercury-like liquid metal, that emerged from itsrecessed center, flowed over the top and sides, anddown over, then under the splayed base - which theynow saw was not circular, but irregularly andqueerly angled. And as they watched, the angleschanged, also randomly, as though some strangegeometric puzzle were being played out before them.From across the room the Thing had appeared tobe a dull yellow - Don had first supposed it to begold - but now as they looked at it closely, theyrealized that it was actually a shifting spectrum ofcolors, in which the dull yellow and a kind oftranslucent green seemed to predominate. Andyreached out to touch it; then his wrist was grippedhard by Indiana Jones. “No, not a good idea. Neverseen anything like that before. Might be dangerous.”“Could - that be the Grail?” asked Don.Jones glanced at him. “I think we’re looking atsomething far older and more alien than any of theGrail legends you’re familiar with, Don. If it bearsany relation to them, it’s as the prototype -something that gave rise to all the stories.”“What do you think it actually is?” said Patty,more curious than intimidated by the strangeapparition.Before Jones could answer her, Andy leaned overthe top of the object and pointed the beam from hiselectric light at the center of the metalliceffervescence. “See that? I think we’re looking atmolecular transmutation of some sort. The‘Philosopher’s Stone’, if you like. Energy-to-matter- 322 -conversion without atomic fission or fusion. I bet ifyou had a Geiger counter here, it wouldn’t registerso much as a blip. And whatever is going on here hassome sort of Klein-bottle, some Mœbius topology toit; it’s folding back into itself.” He turned back tothem excitedly. “Do you realize what this is? This isa perfect steady-state,” - he grasped for words -“the whole perpetual motion thing. Not even gravityaffects it, probably.”“But it’s evidently affected other things,” Donpointed out. “People around it. In this case veryobviously the entire ground-structure underlyingthe original Mission here.”“I’ll hazard a guess on that,” said Patty slowly.“This - Grail - may be something stable or steady-state in itself, but it has an external property as well:amplification. Amplification not of what weusually think of as matter and energy, because we’represuming it to be insulated from that.Amplification of ... of the soul, of the soul’s energy.”Indiana Jones stared at her, then at Andy, thenDon in growing surprise. “Where is all this comingfrom? Are you listening to yourselves? You soundas though - as though you’re speaking from thatthing itself!”Patty smiled through him, then continued:“That would explain why the Grail is supposed tobe both a source of great healing and great harm toanyone coming into contact with it. Near a malignperson it radiates, well, ‘evil’. Near a gentle, peacefulperson, it radiates ‘good’. Can you see what a dangerit is, given the instability of the human psyche?”“It’s all beginning to make sense,” said Jonesthoughtfully. “The desire of the English to keep it,yet their fear to keep it in increasing times ofanxiety and stress. Its erratic, unpredictable- 323 -influence in all the places it was kept in SpanishCalifornia. And Payeras! The Grail must have beensent to him as an ‘object of evil’ which he wasexpected to ‘contain’. So what did he do, with hisexemplary religious piety? He focused his will onthis ‘evil thing’ as something to be hated, notknowing that in doing so he was activating in itamplified forces of his own hatred which reachedout to destroy his entire Mission!”He stopped abruptly, looked around at themagain with a startled expression, put his hands to hisforehead with a sudden shudder.“More than that,” said Don slowly, evenly, “we’relooking at the key to all of the legends surroundingthe Grail: why it served innocent and naïve peoplebeneficially, yet proved deadly to even the mostwell-intentioned seekers of more deep and complexcharacter. Why whenever it was found, it wouldquickly be concealed or ‘lost’ again. As soon as itsactual effects were comprehended, it became of theutmost necessity, and urgency, to send it away ordepart from its presence. As,” he added quietly,“we’re going to have to do now.”One by one the others nodded, Indiana Jones thelast and with obvious reluctance. “This was going tobe the greatest find of my entire career,” he saiddejectedly. “And now not only can’t I produce it forthe world, but I have to do as all the rest of theseekers did, and conceal it again!”Patty put her arm around his shouldersympathetically. “There’s something you’reforgetting, Indy. Most people who have looked forthe Grail - and there have been a great many, youknow - have never found it, never known thisexquisite and dreadful truth that we have come tosee here. You have done it. And you, like Galahad[index-324_1.jpg][index-324_2.jpg]- 324 -and Parsifal, have survived that encounter, passedthe test that has destroyed lesser beings. No displaycase in a museum is going to grant you anythingclose to that.”Jones sighed deeply, took off his hat and rubbedhis forehead again. “You’re right, of course. Andwe’re in danger the longer we stay in its vicinity, justas obviously. Let’s get out of here, now.”The four of them, after a final, fascinated glanceat the unearthly phenomenon before them, turnedand retraced their steps through the rubble and upthe crumbling stairwell they had so eagerlydescended a few minutes earlier. Nothing more wassaid; nothing needed to be said.Later that dsy they returned to the ravine withseveral bags of concrete, mixed and poured themdown the aperture, filling it completely. Dirt anddebris were then added to the top, until it was oncemore indistinguishable from the surrounding brush.8:30 PM, Wednesday, February 5, 1997; Pea SoupAndersen’s, Buellton, California:- 325 -“I’m betting,” said Andy contentedly, “thatnobody else who’s ever done what we did everfinished the day with a better bowl of pea soup thanthat!”Indiana Jones nodded affably, then stood upfrom the table and stretched. “I suppose I’d betterhead on back to L.A. During the drive I get to figureout how much of this I can explain to Marion - andwhy her paper for the Getty is going to be - going tohave a less spectacular conclusion than she’d hoped.Drop you at the airport down there, Don?”“No, I think I’ll hitch a ride north with Patty andAndy, stay with them at their place in the redwoodsfor a couple of days. I need to walk around in thetrees awhile, get my head together on all of thisbefore flying home.” Don reached out and grippedJones’ hand warmly. “But, you know, I’m nevergoing to be quite the same again. And whenever Ipass through Hollywood, I’m going to stop atHamburger Hamlet and drink a silent toast to themural.”- 326 -[index-327_1.jpg][index-327_2.jpg][index-327_3.jpg][index-327_4.jpg]- 327 -Appendix #3: Cthulhu’s Gate- byEric KauschenMaster of the Temple of SetGrand Master Emeritus, Order of the TrapezoidApril 30, 2003 CETo the west of San Francisco’s Richmond Districtlies the fashionable Sea Cliff neighborhood, with itsluxurious estates and unique vistas of the ocean-sideof the Golden Gate Bridge. Crowning this enclave isthe California Palace of the Legion of Honor, easilythe city’s most elegant art museum,... albeit tinged with its own macabre mysteries.Here in 1958 Madeleine Elster fell under themalignant spell of the infamous portrait of CarlottaValdez in Gallery 7, causing her to attempt suicidefirst at spectral Fort Point beneath the Golden Gate[index-328_1.jpg][index-328_2.jpg]- 328 -Bridge, then twice successfully from the bell-towerof Mission San Juan Bautista. 80To the west of the Legion Palace, however, allsigns of civilization abruptly fall victim to the cragsand wildbrush of the aptly-named “Land’s End”,whose trails are trodden only by courageousgeologists, maddened artists & musicians, and in hislast years Anton Szandor LaVey.Few San Franciscans care to venture there, atleast not if they plan to return. And the onlystructure which sought to violate its quietude,Adolph Sutro’s cyclopæn swimming “Baths” of theturn of the 20th-Century, is now a torturously-80 These incidents so horrified public sensibilities that themurderous painting was removed from Gallery 7 and the entirebell-tower from the mission church. But not before AlfredHitchcock was strongly criticized for daring to portray theseshocking events in his “fictional” Vertigo. The erasure has notbeen complete: Judy’s room is preserved in what is now SanFrancisco’s “Vertigo Hotel”, with its dizzifying centralstaircase.[index-329_1.jpg][index-329_2.jpg][index-329_3.jpg][index-329_4.jpg]- 329 -tangled ruin, whose leering remnants the cityfathers have never dared disturb.I was always fascinated with this place mostlybecause the Baths were an odd little part of SanFrancisco’s outré history. They were a “modern”reconstruction of the Roman bathes, but with moreadded to them. They had restaurants, a botanicalgarden, and diorama displays of animals that mostpeople even in jaded San Francisco had never seen:- 330 -The Sutro Baths were located right next to theCliff House, a restaurant and meeting place wherethe United Nations was brought into being.This area, along with Adolph Sutro’s park andmansion across the street, served as the north partof the beach strip that looked down on Playland-at-the-Beach and the expanse of the Pacific Ocean.The Sutro Baths started as an interestingstopping place for visitors, but there was a bit of anodd side to the area. The Baths were fed by sea waterinto cold, warm, and heated pools.There were rather strange occurrences thathappened in this area.The first were the two fires that destroyed theCliff House next door.The second was a peculiarity of the waters in theBaths turning black in color quite frequently andhaving to be replenished immediately.The machinery necessary to pump the water inand out of the pools of this Victorian creation brokedown constantly, creating further problems, to thepoint that the Baths were finally converted into anice-skating rink.In 1963 a mysterious fire destroyed the structure,and the ruins were left untouched.Over the years the plant life grew to become onewith many of the ruins except for right where thewater of the ocean would hit the rocks.To the north of the ruins is an observation deckwith crumbling stairs and badly-rusting handrailsleading down to a stone outcropping whose originalpurpose can’t be determined from Park Servicedocuments. In an obsessively safety-consciouspresent-day, it is remarkable that this precarious,indeed dangerous route remains publicly accessible[and unrepaired], but there it is:[index-331_1.jpg][index-331_2.jpg]- 331 -I’ve talked to people who remember the oldBaths and none could remember what this area wasused for.At the bottom of the stairs was a cave that is nowsealed, but when I was a teenager this cave wasopen.The mouth is about six feet high and perhapsfour feet wide.To get to the opening you would walk across ashort stone bridge that had pools of water to eitherside that were formed from water that splashed induring high tides. These pools are of particularinterest because of the way the currents workaround Land’s End. The shelf drops into rather deepocean surf below; the close compression to the rockscreates what is called by oceanographers an“upwelling”, where water is literally sucked up fromthe deep to form the large waves that crash into therocks.As a teenager I would poke around in these poolsand find the usual crabs and limpets and occasionalfish; but I would also find deep water nudibranches(sea slugs), octopi, and bioluminescent fish that[index-332_1.jpg][index-332_2.jpg]- 332 -would be sucked up from the deep and dumped intothese pools. The bioluminescent fish wereparticularly amusing at night because the pools wereglow with the sparks of light from their bodies.Seeing them in the water at night while thewaves crashed over the small observation deckwould inspire thoughts of H.P. Lovecraft and theexpectation that Cthulhu would rise up from one ofthe pools at any moment!To the south of the observation deck is what Iused to refer to as the “ocean’s lawn”.. It was an areaof rocks blanketed with sea anemones that coversroughly 20 by 50 feet. When the water sits shallowover them it appears very much like a lawn that hasbeen submerged. These anemones are of the genusTealia, which, while common to the Monterey area,aren’t usually found here in San Francisco.I have described this area in detail with areason: If this seaside exotica doesn’t suffice toinvite nightly visits by Cthulhu and the Deep Ones,there are yet more sinister depths here to beplumbed.[index-333_1.jpg][index-333_2.png]- 333 -Remember that sealed-off cave? The ParkService decided to cement it closed in 1981 for onereason only: They were tired of having to drag deadbodies out of it. Common to all such bodies, oddly,was that there was no indication of how they haddied. None had been shot, stabbed or alcohol orother drugs in their system. They just appeared tono longer have the will to live.This was the story I had heard for years anddismissed as an urban legend - until one day I readin the paper that the Park Service was going to sealthe cave for precisely that reason!My friend Tim and I, being in our late teensdecided we would resolve the mystery of the cavebefore it was sealed. Silly as it seems, we further feltthat flashlights wouldn’t be properly atmospheric.We obtained a couple of backyard Tiki-torches onpoles to carry with us, like bona-fide explorers; welacked only pith helmets.We arrived at the cave around 9 in the morning,when it was too early, cold, and foggy to expect ParkRangers interfering with our adventure.[index-334_1.jpg][index-334_2.jpg]- 334 -Once within we immediately noticed that thefloor was wet and slippery, though the walls werecompletely dry. We noticed that intermittentrailings had been constructed along portions of thewalls, probably by the Rangers in particularlyhazardous areas. This was reassuring.Once we’d passed beyond the sounds of thecrashing waves outside, we became aware of a low,regular pounding or thumping sound, which weassumed to be the echo of some “upwell” pocketfurther down.There was also the smell: a rank, fetid odor likethat of decaying fish.We had gone perhaps 150 feet into the cave whenthe torches began to flicker and fail. Maybe theatmosphere was too humid. But neither of us likedthe idea of finding ourselves in total darkness.Both torches winked out simultaneously.Fortunately we could see the cave-mouth behind usin the morning light, and we stumbled back towardsit, since trying to run on that slippery ground wouldhave been unwise.- 335 -Finally we regained the entrance, none the worseexcept some minor cuts and bruises from the roughrock walls. Our clothes were so impregnated withthe cave’s odor, however, that washing proveduseless; we both had to throw them out.Was that cave a natural chasm, or a human-cutfeature of the ancient Land’s End storm drains? Wenever found out. But we were both convinced thatthere was something disturbing about it, beyond itsmere construction. We’d both been in “normal”caves before, and there was something decidedly“wrong” about this one. Perhaps it’s for the best thatthe torches winked out when they did.- 336 -- 337 -About the Author- 338 -[index-339_1.jpg][index-339_2.png]- 339 -Michael A.
