Eckleburg: blue andgigantic - their retinas a yard high. They stare out from no face, butinstead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass overan invisible nose. Evidently some obscure oculist set them therebefore sinking himself into eternal blindness, or merely forgettingthem and moving away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many daysunder the sun and rain, brood on enigmatically over the spectrallandscape.- F.

Antimatter composedof inside-out material, shadow-matter that can penetrate tenmiles of lead shielding. Hidden deep in the heart of strangenew elements are secrets beyond human understanding -new powers, new dimensions, worlds within worlds,unknown ...- The Control Voice“The Production and Decay of Strange Particles”The Outer Limits, April 20, 1964In 2013 the strange particle MindWar was published.Instead of decaying, however, it has emitted two evenstranger particles: MindStar (2016) and now FindFar(2017). Altogether these three particles meld to generatean über strange trimolecule, exposure to whichresynapsizes the human brain to regard the existentialphenomenon of sentient humanity in radically-newmanifestations.MindWar is a practical manual for the retirement oftraditional, physical warfare (PhysWar/PW) in favor ofcooperative, pacific invention against an artificially-controlled environmental atmosphere subconsciouslyaligning the cognitive processes of the human brain awayfrom natural chaos to supernatural serenity.- 18 -MindStar addresses the one component of humanmentality that the externalized MindWar intentionallypostpones: the metaphysical “soul”, or more preciselyeightfold emanations collectively comprising theMindStar of eternal, immortal, isolate self-consciousness.O.K., so that was the easy part.Aficionados of MW will [p]recall that a successful MWcampaign requires first the designing, then the gradualimplementation of an improved entity profile: either the“best practical” áristos or, in ideal opportunities, theperfected polis of kalokagathia. This analysis involvesforecasting, but once again not what conventionallypasses for forecasting: static “snapshots” of estimatedfuture points in linear time.Instead MW utilizes a Fourth-Dimensional, dynamiccalculus called FindFar (FF), which is the subject of thisthird book in the series.FF is not a static picture but one in motion: aprojection which is in constant harmonization with theMW campaign during its activation. Indeed there is a“double-dynamic” in process, since the targeted futureand the current standpoint-of-perspective are bothchanging relative to each other, and both against anyexternal “backdrops”: a continuum of true, notEinsteinian-absurd relativity.The task of FindFar is not just to describe thismachinery, but to do so without bewildering the reader.Any tool, no matter how elegant, is useless unless oneknows how to use it reasonably effortlessly. Hence FF iswritten not so much as a turgid textbook as aconversation, interacting with the reader and frequentlygoing back over obscure or complex points. The result, Ihope, will be a reading experience as stimulating as it isinformative.In places I daresay it is also sobering. MW is not apleasant puzzle for ivory-tower entertainment; it is an[index-19_1.png]- 19 -instrument of power and force to overcome theformidable inertia of an existing global crisis ofintolerable destruction, misery, pain, and death. MW’sapplication requires not just understanding and wisdom,but the clearsighted coldness and divine detachment ofDr. T.J. Eckleburg. There will be ample flexibility forpleasure once the bloodflow of PW has been arrested.If you eventually find yourself in an opportuneposition to activate MW in whole or part, FF should be apractical resource. Short of such an opportunity, it mayalso be of value as a stand-alone tool, replacing theclumsiness and obsolescence of conventional forecastingwith a sleeker, swifter alternative. So take it out on a test-drive and let me know how well it works for you.Learn to smile.San FranciscoFebruary 2, 2017 CE- 20 -[index-21_1.jpg]- 21 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1: FINDING THE FAR FUTUREChange is the law of life. And those who look only tothe past or present are certain to miss the future.- John F. KennedyThe future belongs to those who believe in thebeauty of their dreams.- Eleanor RooseveltA. Status Quo: Chaos1. “Frozen in the Headlights”Right out of the starting gate, conventionalapproaches to political problem-solving are doomed toconfusion, frustration, and failure for a very simplereason: There is no framework for solution andphased implementation.Rather the subject problem is treated as anamorphous, discrete incident or state-of-affairs;accordingly any proposed “solutions” are designed andconsidered for immediate appeasement and gratificationof [preferred] interested parties.The symptoms - not the causes - are treated, and“the can is kicked down the road” - only to reappearthereupon at a later date, most probably in an even moreproblematic state.- 22 -2. Three HeadlightsThere are three primary reasons for this, as well asnumerous subsets of the three. They are:a. PressureIn a world of political nation/states, nationalgovernments are expected to be the initiators and agentsof problem solution. With few exceptions thesegovernments are short-tenured, dependent upon formalelections or factional/popular support to remain inauthority. They are accordingly under constant pressurefor immediate, not long-term solutions to perceivednational or international problems.The usual response is to look for a showpiece ofimmediate gratification rather than the frustration of anextended policy that may actually be more practical.A conspicuous contemporary example is the concernabout “global warming”. While there is scientificuncertainty about how much, if any of this is the fault ofhuman contamination of the Earth’s atmosphere, asopposed, for instance, to subtle changes in Solar activityand/or Earth’s orbital path/tilt, the possibility that theremight actually be nothing completely arresting orreversing which humans can do about the trend is toofearsome and fatalistic to confront; so the Solar/orbitalexplanations are ignored and a scapegoat sought with aneck to wring, in this case that of the fossil-fuel industry.Shut it down; save the Earth.The result: impulsive protests, pickets, boycotts, riotsuntil there is some governmental response to assuage thefear. But because of that pressure such response willnecessarily be more cosmetic, placating, immediately-gratifying than substantive.- 23 -b. Ulterior MotivesAlternately the issue is not really excoriated for itself,but as one of a number of means for the ambitious anddisaffected to unseat the existing government for itsalleged helplessness and ineptitude. The replacementregime may have no better solution in mind, other thantrying to divert public attention from the scarecrow onceit is in power.In 1960 Democratic Presidential candidate John F.Kennedy and his party raised the spectre of a “missilegap” with the Soviet Union. Since both superpowersalready possessed the nuclear weaponry to obliterateeach other [not to mention the rest of the planet] severaltimes over, this monster-under-the-bed rather begged thequestion, but no matter: Elect Jack and he’d zap the gap.c. No Way OutOr, and least confrontably, of course, there maysimply be no possible or practical solution: Globalwarming may in truth be caused by conditions completelybeyond human control, and political instability andagitation is actually, ultimately emotional denial andapocalyptic panic.3. Thousand-Pound CanariesNor is there any paucity of supernational problems toworry the world above and beyond international andintranational conflicts. In addition to the aforementionedglobal warming concern, the United Nations identifiesthe planet’s principal problems [alphabetized, notprioritized].And yes, this is a bummer of a long list:- 24 -a. AfricaIt is Africa’s fortune to be the most ancient andmagical of continents, and misfortune to have a history ofunparalleled suffering, often ignored by the rest of theworld, and still a scourge today. Wars and catastrophesthat would be shocking elsewhere pass in the night,unnoticed there. A new respect and compassion is longoverdue for this cradle of human civilization.b. AgingThere are a relative few cultures that are advancedenough to respect, love, and care for their elders. In manymore their fate is a lonely, neglected, and miserable one.At issue here is humanity’s regard for its own creationand lineage, which must be relearned as much from thegreat civilizations of antiquity as restored in a futureutopia.c. AgricultureWhile science has discovered much about the life offlora & fauna, it has not been as successful in learningconsideration for them and a balance in husbandryamidst the Earth’s still-fertile areas. High standards aredemanded beyond national borders if Gaia is to surviveand nurture her children.d. AIDSMany of humanity’s curses are the result of naturalhazard and universal entropy. AIDS is quite different: ascourge that we have brought upon ourselves, and whichshould never have been allowed to survive, much less- 25 -grow these many years. Exceptional, uncommon effortmust be made to send it back into nonexistence.e. Atomic EnergyFrom the myths of the ancients to the scholasticism ofthe medievals, it was axiomatic that the universe iseverywhere subject to Natural Law, also known as thegods or God, which is breached by mankind at its peril. Indaring to smash the atom, we let loose, in the words of J.Robert Oppenheimer, “Death the Destroyer of Worlds”.At once the least-noticed and most-final of all thesechallenges and dangers, it is as imminent as the clock-hands on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.f. ChildrenAs shameful as the world’s treatment of its elderly isits carelessness concerning its young, the more so in anage where the comfort of family has all too often beenreplaced by the distance and disinterest of alienation,foreshadowing the plight of the old at the end of the samejourney.g. DecolonizationThe enslavement of entire nations by their fellowsshould have become extinct long ago, yet vestiges stilllinger to this day, often in economic guise.h. DeminingNumerous local PhysWars have come and gone, buttheir land mines and other unexploded ordinanceremain, maiming or killing farmers or children who pickup such “toys”.- 26 -i. Democracy“The worst possible form of government except for thealternatives.” Plato was right to dread the eikasia of themasses; if democracy is to succeed, the electorate must bediligently schooled in its wise application.j. DevelopmentIt was once fashionable to assume that the poorestand most desperate countries of the post-colonial “ThirdWorld” would raise themselves up to the affluent andleisured lifestyles of their old conquerors. Rarely has thishappened; the excesses of the centuries of extractionsneed to be remedied just as enduringly.k. DisarmamentIt is not just atomic weaponry that poses a danger tohumanity; the proliferation of conventional armaments isproving every bit as lethal - and, unlike nukes, iseverywhere in PhysWar use.l. EnvironmentThe ecosphere in all its aspects suffers from pollution,contamination, and outright destruction: endangeringnot just humanity but many other species of life as well.m. FamilyPressures of PhysWar, economic hardship, and socialstresses threaten the safety and comfort of the familyunit, with painful consequences to husbands, wives, andchildren. This relates also to the specific plights ofchildren and the aged.- 27 -n. FoodThe adequacy, safety, quality, and equitableavailability and distribution of nutrition worldwide.“Unprofitable” excesses in production are routinelydiscarded while, far away and unnoticed, children andtheir parents starve slowly to death.o. GovernanceThe prudent creation and maintenance of nationalgovernmental structures and systems that benefit theircitizenry and sustain the resources of their territories.Whatever ideology clothes this effort is not nearly asimportant as its effectiveness and humanitarian benefit.p. HealthPrevention and treatment of disease and injury,accessible to the poor as well as the wealthy. Unceasingvigilance over living environmental conditions to ensurethey do not threaten the health of the living.q. Human RightsAbove social-contractual civil rights particular to eachnation are human rights of life, liberty, and dignity whichall beings should enjoy - but rarely do.r. Human SettlementAs all the habitable areas of the planet have beenfound and claimed by nation-states, and as none of themhas any population control or resource-sharing programssufficient for balance, overcrowded cities, slums, and- 28 -ghettos continue to proliferate: breeding-grounds formany of these other critical problems.s. Humanitarian AssistanceNatural disasters and human PhysWars periodicallydevastate areas of the planet, requiring prompt andadequate emergency aid beyond the capacity of the localgovernment(s).t. International LawAlways problematic, because there is rarelyinternational agreement on laws beyond those ofindividual states, nor effective policing and enforcementresources for such covenants as are agreed to.u. OceansThe Earth is an ocean-planet, interrupted by a relativefew, comparatively small land masses. Humans forgetthis truth at their peril. If the oceans die, the planet dies,regardless what purely-land efforts are made.v. Peace & SecurityThe unpleasant truth of PhysWar is that, whileeverywhere rhetorically denounced, it has come to be theeconomic and industrial backbone of humanity. MWinsists that this need not and should not be so.w. Persons with DisabilitiesFurther aggravating and complicating the issues ofhealth, children, family, and aging. personal illness,incapacity, and weakness jeopardize not only the- 29 -individual afflicted, but supportive friends, relatives, andsocial services as well.x. PopulationHuman reproduction is everywhere explosive andcompletely uncontrolled, resulting in the overrunning ofresources, irreversible contamination, extinction ofnonhuman life, and extreme suffering among theincreasingly-overcrowded. Attempts to control thisepidemic are howled down as discrimination, racism,genocide, xenophobia. Very simply, if it is not broughtunder control - if it is even still possible to do so - it alonewill terminally unbalance the Earth’s ecosphere.y. RefugeesAs countries and regions become inhospitable anduninhabitable from natural disasters, PhysWar, orclimate change, their original inhabitants will leave insearch of survival elsewhere. The “elsewheres” are,however, already populated and resource-allocated.Worse yet, this problem promises to increase on acompound basis as it interacts with overpopulation.z. TerrorismWhen desperate, deprived, and angry people cannotget the life-support and benefits they feel they deserve bycooperation, they will attempt to seize them by force andviolence, including by the disruption and if necessarydestruction of national social orders.- 30 -aa.VolunteerismWhile many charitable individuals and groups arewilling to do what they can to alleviate some or all ofthese global problems, such humanitarians rarely enjoythe funding and backing they need; and even faceobstruction and injury themselves from those who profitfrom the existing PhysWars and other miseries.ab.WaterThe “common denominator” of the majority of theseglobal issues, from oceans to populations. Clean, clear,pure water is the substance of all Earthly life. Whenever itis contaminated, reduced, or eliminated, the Earth dies alittle more.ac. WomenIn a world everywhere dominated by PhysWarviolence and its societal reflections, women, whosereproductive bodies and biologies make them morevulnerable to and dependent upon males not so limited,everywhere suffer discrimination, marginalization, andexploitation. Their human dignity demands respect equalto males’, and indeed extra consideration in keeping withtheir additional needs as the bringers and nurturers oflife.4. StarfishAltogether this overwhelming, daunting list certainlystarts ourselves, MindWar, and this book out glumly. Letus suppose that MW can be activated to solve agovernmental or border crisis in the Ukraine. With all ofthe above megaproblems still crippling that geography- 31 -and its surrounds, is such modest success worth the time,effort, and expense? Or is it rather the proverbial “drop inthe bucket”?In answer MW invokes the parable of the starfishwashed up on the shore. A compassionate beachcombernotices it and places it gently back into the sea to liveinstead of die. Has this small act meant anything for theEarth as a planet? Perhaps not, but it’s meant somethingto that little starfish.So MW is in the starfish-rescue business, saving noteverything but something, where and when it can.That’s the justification for the MindWar book, and nowthis one in supplement to it.5. ActivationThe first step in actually, rather than cosmeticallysolving posed problems is the development andapplication of a framework for both analysis andcorrective practical implementation.Such a framework first identifies the problem’scomponents, then fixes the problem by addressing them,and - just as importantly - scheduling the fixprogressively against future benchmarks. So it is ananalysis with both a status quo (the situation at present)and a status post (the situation after the fix, at aprojected future date).6. Lawa. DefinitionA descriptive law is a statement of exclusive,invariable cause-and-effect.This statement does not extend to the “how” or the“why” of the process.- 32 -b. ClassificationIn his Summa Theologica St. Thomas Aquinas(1225-74) described the ordering of the universe by fourtypes of law, detailed below. Do not make the commonmistake of assuming that only Human Law is relevant tocontemporary conflict-resolution. The other three are justas present today as in Aquinas’ era, and if anything evenmore forceful.Both Eternal and Natural Law are present in the 95%“pattern thinking” of subconsciousness, which is whythey are omnipresent and preemptive of the others.Divine Law is a hybrid: It is “announced” in the 5% ofconsciousness, but is assimilated into the 95%subconscious once accepted. Accordingly Divine Law is atonce the easiest of the three subconscious Laws for theMWarrior to control, and in many instances an absolutelycrucial preemption. Contemporarily, for instance, bothIsrael and the Islamic State [to name just two of manyexamples] are driven by what they believe to be therealities and commandments of their gods, with theirself-constructed (Human) laws and practices incompliance with and obedience to that Divine Lawperception. This is exactly why third-party countries ormediators fail: They ignore the [permanent] 95% andwaste their time in exhaustive, futile, and temporary 5%.(1) Eternal LawAquinas, in keeping with the idiom of the CatholicChurch, saw the entirety of the universe as the creationand continuation of the mind and will of God, which byassumption is above and beyond human comprehension.All that can be known about it is that it is, because thereis existence of things and their behaviors, not absence.- 33 -This theory, however, requires the arbitrarypresumption of time being both linear and finite [cf.Chapter #2], with the universe having a moment ofcreation as well as one termination, between which is asingle, universally-interrelated timeline. In short [or inthis case long], creation requires a creator; destruction adestroyer. Within Christian ideology this concept isknown as eschatology, especially emphasizing itsconclusion.Internally the difficulty with this concept is that itnecessarily raises the question of priority: If only Godexisted prior to creation, how could he know/distinguishhimself, or conceive creation? Is it possible for there tobe a reason for creation, necessarily requiring someexternal reference or alternative - in which case knowncreation cannot be entire creation, imperfecting anytheories, principles, and laws thought to be universal?And, eschatologically, why should the known universebe destroyed? A divine moral judgment [as conventionalreligions assume], or merely the same whim thatengendered its creation? In that latter case it wouldfollow that all efforts at virtue by universal inhabitantsare futile, merely self-deceptive, purposeless abstinencefrom the fullest experience and expression of life.Beyond the doctrinal confines of Judæo-Christianitythese limitations evaporate. Non-linear time, as in thecircular or cyclical cosmologies of antiquity, need neitherorigin nor originator, bur extend endlessly into the pastas into the future. Existence similarly needs no excuse orcause, because it is just as primally-inherent asnonexistence. This may be a bit difficult for linear-trainedminds to grasp, but it is helpful, if not essential to FFtechnology and application, as will be seen herein.Throughout an eternal, omnipresent cosmos, itsordering, binding, and consistency principles - called[Egyptian] neteru, gods, or Pythagorean/Platonic Forms- 34 -- are also omnipresent and ageless, and of course need norationale for their preservation of order.(2) Natural LawNatural Law is Eternal Law to the extent that humanreason can detect consistent principles in the ObjectiveUniverse (OU). This process of detection and definition iscalled [physical] “science”. As it is the extension ofineffable Eternal Law, it is presumed to be beyondjustification, and also beyond violation.Because of Natural Law’s OUniversality it isproblematical whether any part(s) of it could be brokenby inquisitive or brash humans, if they wished to soattempt. Certainly any disruption such violation couldcause would be chaotic in the extreme, perhaps to adisastrous degree.One example of such “Natural Law blasphemy” mightbe the smashing of natural atomic structures in order torelease the power therein, as was done at Los Alamos in1945 at the culmination of the Manhattan Project. Theresult was the unleashing of a concentration of powernever otherwise existing apart from stars such as Earth’sSun. Decades later the Earth is still endangered by theconsequences of that experiment, as manifest inPhysWar’s forest of thermonuclear weapons.(3) Divine LawDivine Law governs human behavior concerningNatural Law - prescribing its use and proscribing itsabuse - as directly revealed of the mind of God throughthe media of Judæo-Christianity, e.g. its “Old Testament”prophets, Jesus Christ and his “New Testatment”spokesman, and the Jewish/Christian institutionsmaking pronouncements on their behalf.- 35 -Similar non-Christian authority is also claimed byJudaism’s other principal spin-off, Islam.Such Divine Law, since it is deemed to emanate fromthe Godhead. is held to be absolutely mandatory andsuperior to the fourth and lowest category, Human Law.Examples are the Holy Bible of J/C and the Koran ofIslam. It will be noted that extraordinary political poweraccrues to individuals and institutions with the right tointerpret such Laws.This is of especial important in MW campaigns inwhich supranational religious values - perceived DivineLaw - plays a part, because it controls the beliefs andbehavior of involved humans more than is possible withany of their Human Laws. MW operators must assumecontrol of Divine Law dictates through MWB’s PSYCONs,and re-“interpret” them as necessary. It hardly need benoted that this requires the utmost sensitivity andprecision to establish the required “authenticity”, andthat this is an extremely irrational and emotionalenvironment of MW operation.(4) Human LawAs Aquinas impressed it, Human Law comprisescodes and conventions which humans and their politicalinstitutions create for themselves, and which, to be goodand virtuous, should reflect the dictates of Divine Lawand the principles of Natural Law. In other words,humanity should not make laws just for their pleasure orconvenience, but in obedience to and conformity withhigher laws. When the United States’ foundingdocuments, or those of the other great revolutions,invoked “endowed” and “inalienable” rights, they werecalling upon this higher-law authority.PhysWars, and replacement MW campaigns, findthemselves in disputes often phrased as disagreements- 36 -over national and/or international law. Once again it isessential to be sensitive to the authority claimed by allsuch laws, whether “merely” human or Divine/Natural-authentic.Politically-atheistic nations - such as the UnitedStates, Europe, Russia, and China - are termed thus notbecause they don’t have some religious population, butbecause their governance ignores Eternal, Natural, andDivine Law in their crafting of Human Laws. In somecountries, indeed, any overtly-religious influence inlawmaking is expressly forbidden, as in the United States’“church/state separation” doctrine. This fact is notinfrequently made more palatable to superstitiouscitizenry by the use of elaborate but vacuous invocations,blessings, holidays, etc.c. MW SupertheismFrom the above elaboration it follows that, to beeffective in his craft, the MWarrior must not only notallow himself to be enslaved to any of the 95% Laws, butindeed must actively take control of, determine, anddisseminate & “interpret” them. He must intentionallyand convincingly play, if not be God in the MWcampaign. In this role, to be sure, he must never makethe mistake of falling victim to his own PSYCON, or hewill simply have replaced one counterproductive array ofcounterproductive superstitions with another.d. Machiavelli’s AdmonitionNiccolò Machiavelli [discussed in further detail below]contended that since Divine Law is beyond thecomprehension of human reason, it cannot and shouldnot be asserted as justification for social systems. Politics,he argued, belongs wholly to the realm of reason, and- 37 -should be evaluated on that basis alone. “For the mannerin which men live is so different from the way in whichthey ought to live that he who leaves the common coursefor that which he ought to follow will find that it leadshim to ruin rather than to safety.” This focus onexclusively human-formulated, achievable practicality(the áristos) ultimately encourages man to attain dignityby taking complete responsibility for himself.MW therefore frequently confronts situations which,in “Law”-terms, are a destabilized, confused mix ofDivine and Human Law, which it must remedy not just bytaking control of both in the context familiar to theafflicted populace, but also by undertaking theconstruction of an áristos or kalokagathia independentof both conditioned constraints. Ironically such solutionmay, to gain popular credence and acceptance, need to becloaked in Divine- and/or Human-Law masquerade.7. Sciencesa. Physical: Natural awWhen physical scientists identify a problem in theirrespective discipline, they address it against a standard ofreality - “scientific law” - which they have carefully andlaboriously developed over the entire course of humanhistory. Thus a problem in mathematics is firstarticulated, then specified, then finally calculated andsolved by and within accepted mathematical laws. It issimply a matter of “plugging the problem in” to thoselaws, then calculating its resolution accordingly.b. However ...There are of course cheats.- 38 -Sometimes when a new problem doesn’t fitcompletely and comfortably into the “sacred reality” ofthe accepted standard, it is not permitted to offend thatgod, but is simply rephrased to force it to fit, likeCinderella’s glass slipper being replaced with a larger oneto satisfy the ambitions of her stocky stepsisters. 1In especially sacrilegious situations wherein a newproblem not merely annoys, but explodes coreassumptions of the accepted standard, it may be dealtwith by simply ignoring it - as for instance the question ofhow a pre- “Big Bang” clump of universal matter/energy( ylem) came into being and who touched a match to it toinitiate the “expanding universe”. 2As long as these two rugs exist under whichannoyances can be swept, the physical sciences can atleast pretend to respectability.c. Social: No Law .˙. No ScienceWith the social sciences it is a different matter. Theconventional wisdom is that they are not indeed “real”sciences at all, because science requires a rigid,laboratory-repeatable standard of natural law. The socialsciences, however, all involve the supposed wild card of“human discretion”, which is generally assumed to bewhimsical, hence unpredictable. So Political Science,History, Sociology, and Anthropology have all devolvedinto the mere recording and critical evaluation of pastevents.1 “Never let an inconvenient fact spoil a good theory.” - WolframHanrieder, Professor of Political Science, University of California,[jokingly] to the author as a graduate student ca. 1975.2 “[Tools for scientists include] a magnifying glass for the detection ofimperfections, and a can of black spray paint to instantly cover upinconvenient imperfections.” - Anton Szandor LaVey, High Priest ofthe Church of Satan, ca. 1970.- 39 -d. However ...In the case of Political Science this reticence isarguably unjustified. Human thinking and behavior canbe predicted at both the individual and the mass level.As the author’s companion book in this series,MindWar, explains and details, human actions resultfrom individuals’ perception of “reality”, collected into“thought patterns” assembled in the subconsciousness:overwhelmingly the product of similarly-subconscioussensory input. As MindWar further proposes, shapethose inputs through psychological control artifice(PSYCONs) and you shape the derived reality-patterns,consequently the boundaries and tendencies of behaviorwithin them. 3In addition to the recognition and control of humanbehavioral mechanisms, a schematic is needed for thecoherent identification, analysis, resolution, andconsequent outcome of a social problem. Here too thestats quo is woefully inadequate, indeed chaotic.Because it is taken for granted that human behavior isunpredictable, no attempt to address issues beyond theimmediate alleviation of emotions is made. The only“extensions into the future” considered are those ofpresumed permanent force, such as national territorialborders and sovereignty. The result is little more than asuccession of temporary “bandages”, lasting only until anext one is necessary. Summarily: chaos held onlytemporarily at bay.3 Aquino, Michael A., MindWar. San Francisco: Barony of Rachane,2013, 2o16.[index-40_1.jpg]- 40 -B. Status Post: FindFarHaving recognized that human behavior is bothpredictable and controllable, the next step is to develop amechanism to accomplish both methodically, wisely, andconstructively when applied to potential, incipient, orexisting problem situations. Instead of endlessly andinadequately bandaging chaos, we shall eliminate it infavor of a coherent, ordered, and beneficial future: Plato’skalokagathia. 4Crucial to this adventure is that mere prediction - orsocial-scientific “forecasting” - is not enough; too oftenthat assumes merely anticipating the probability offutures of alternative chaotic-bandaging. Kalokagathiademands that the entire process be ordered andcontrolled towards a predetermined outcome. The vehiclethis book presents to effect this is characterized by “thefinding of the far” in capabilities, capacities, and coursesof action, thus:As both an analytical and a practical tool, FindFar(hereinafter “FF”) serves as the “reverse-engineering”component of MindWar (“MW”), through which the bestpossible practical outcome ( áristos5) is traced back to thepresent by its progressively-necessary decisions and4 The ancient Greek term καλοκαγαθία. As developed by Plato in theGorgias, kalokagathia identifies “moral virtue reflecting both the natural andthe conventional”: the key to both individual andcommunity perfection.5 Áristos (from the ancient Greek αρίστος): The best for a givensituation. - John Fowles, The Áristos, 1964.- 41 -actions. Thereby a MW campaign is “mapped” to itsintended accomplishment.C. FF Inspiration: MachiavelliTo the establishing of Political Science as a science,FindFar begins where MindWar concluded: with NiccolòMachiavelli (1469-1527), who is famed for, among otherthings, being the first political scientist [as opposed tophilosopher or theorist], by seeking to describe humanpolitics as it is, not as it ought to be.Amidst the instability of Renaissance Italy,Machiavelli sought in his writings, most notably ThePrince, to guide rulers of the various city-states towardsthe establishment and maintenance of functional andstable societies. In essence he sought an appliedkalokagathia embodying the áristos, much the same asmodern statesmen are challenged to do. A closerexamination of The Prince reveals that it is no merecollection of antiquated aphorisms, but a very timelyprescription for FF refinement.1. Fortuna: Four-Dimensional RealityPrior to Machiavelli political philosophers consideredincidents and issues as static questions: Either they wereabstract principles to be apprehended and approximatedto the rational, or they were set-piece, unique situationsto be solved as such. They were not a sequence, process,nor process. As such they were three-dimensional,occupying a momentary displacement in space.To this model Machiavelli added the fourth dimensionof time. For him, political problems were not static, butdynamic, indeed necessarily so. Indeed it was preciselythis dynamism which made them destabilizing.Consequently they could only be solved through 4-- 42 -dimensional strategies, designed and adjusted to matchand control the problems’ dynamic.Machiavelli saw the chaotic 4th dimension as ahaphazard environment of happenstance and accident,which he summarized as fortuna. Fortuna underlay everypolitical problem; therefore the initial task was torecognize and define it according to its constituentfactors.To be valid beyond a purely parochial - hence artificialand ultimately misleading - level, any description offortuna must include proportionate consideration of theaforementioned global problems. These should not,however, be allowed to overwhelm the immediate,localized issue to the point of stymying MW efforts toalleviate it: once again the allegory of the starfish.2. Virtu: Controlling the DimensionsTo overcome, compensate, and neutralize fortuna,Machiavelli advocated a proactive and relentlesscampaign of rationality, reason, and practicality which hecalled virtu. [Today we would call it a “MW campaign”.]Significantly [and somewhat confusingly to modern ears],virtu did not include a “morality” aspect: it addressedproblems strictly in terms of cause-and-effect, hencesolutions similarly. Benign solutions might [and should]suffice for benign situations, but harsh ones mightrequire equally-harsh corrections. It is from this blithepragmatism that Machiavelli received an “evil” image,even to the darkly-comic extent of the Devil being giventhe additional appellation of “Old Nick”.Machiavelli never proposed that “ends justify means”.The correct quote from The Prince #XVIII reads:Moreover, in the actions of all men, and most of all ofPrinces, where there is no tribunal to which we can appeal,we look to results. Wherefore if a Prince succeeds in- 43 -establishing and maintaining his authority, the means willalways be judged honorable and be approved by every one.For the vulgar are always taken by appearances and byresults, and the world is made up of the vulgar, the few onlyfinding room when the many have no longer ground to standon.Virtu is the element of MW analysis in whichidentification of preexisting, “invisible” Eternal, Natural,and Divine Law takes place. Indeed they determine theexisting presumption of virtu. It is precisely thisstandard, to the extent that it is responsible for theexisting problem, which MW must supplant.3. Necessita: Moderating ChangeHaving conceived virtu as an aggressive, activeantidote to fortuna, Machiavelli cautioned that incontaining the extremes of chaos, the solution wasn’tapplied so forcefully as to only displace one chaos withanother. Virtu should be prudent and limited, justenough to neutralize existing hazards and/or preventlooming ones: a regimen of the minimal employment ofpower and force which he called necessita - literally “thenecessary”.With regard to necessita Machiavelli was especiallyconcerned with “economy of violence”, emphasizing thatit should be resorted to not just minimally but as brieflyas possible, that it might be just as quickly forgotten bythe populace. [Pleasantries, on the other hand, should beextended over time to maximize their appreciation.]Once again the aforelisted global issues have a directbearing upon necessita, because some of them are“ticking time-bombs” with varying impact upon thespecific problem addressed in a MW campaign.If, for example, the immediate concern is internalinstability in Bangladesh, due consideration in anysolution must include the global-warming prognosis- 44 -that the entire country will be engulfed by rising oceanduring the 21st century, incidentally aggravating theworldwide refugee problem with its displaced 150million population looking for new places to live.Disputes between India and Pakistan cannot beaddressed in disregard of their both being nuclear-weapons nations, with any such resort by either of themtriggering environmental contamination, health,and “domino” PhysWars elsewhere.4. Occasione: Timing is EverythingA key corollary of Machiavelli’s sensitivity to time washis insistence that, to have maximum effect, applicationsof virtu must be precisely aligned to opportune momentsand trends: occasione. Implementing a strategy too earlyor too late could not only be ineffective but evenaggravate or complicate the problem it was designed tosolve.The tacit assumption is “the sooner the better”, and ifthere is extraordinary suffering involved, this stands toreason. Nevertheless artificial changes, such as involved-countries’ administrations, scheduled internationalconferences, pending economic negotiations/aid, etc.may impair or expedite MW solutions, as may naturalconditions such as seasonal weather patterns andprojected industrial or agricultural phases.The ideal occasione is one in which the MW solutionappears the least intrusive and jarring to localexpectations. The more such involvement is perceived asrescue and relief rather than invasion or domination, thebetter its chances for positive reception and ultimatesuccess.- 45 -5. Ordini: To What End?As a practical political scientist, Machiavelli wasneither an idealist nor a perfectionist. Moreover he wasnot a metaphysician in quest of some transcendentalnobility in the human soul. Drawing rather upon theStoic principles of the Roman Empire, he sought hisversion of the áristos: a “best possible cooperativestability” that he called ordini, “good order”. Indeed theestablishment of ordini would engender its own climateof practical ethics: civitas (again after the ancient Romanprecedent of individual and collective civic duty andresponsibility).The discerning Classical historian may well object thatMachiavelli’s adulation of Rome is rather too glib: Evenas a republic Rome struggled with many inequities andinadequacies, and its eventual collapse into Imperialdespotism came as almost a relief to centuries offactionalism, demagoguery, and endless PhysWar.Marcus Aurelius’ elegant Stoicism can be seen as morewistful aphorism than actual practice. Marcus himselfdidn’t acquire or retain his throne by being the “Mr. NiceGuy” of his celebrated Meditations!Machiavelli was similarly no slave to ideology,including his own or that of his Princely patrons.Whatever succeeded, whatever came right to the point,was his focus, with ideological models or labels beingafter-decoration. Quoth Miles Davis: “I’ll play it first andtell you what it is later.”D. FF Analysis: ReflectionIn formulating his application of solutions to fortuna,Machiavelli also examined the way in which existingsituations and problems are identified and analyzed:- 46 -reflective [as contrasted to impulsive or emotional]thinking.Authentic reflection requires active, continuingattention to factors relevant to practical solutions underconsideration. Conclusions must draw upon bothobservations of the problem and accumulatedknowledge concerning its past history and presentprofile. Additionally current observations must beconsidered in light of past experience to assess theirconsistency and reliability.1. LogicThe culmination of reflection is logical analysis.Logic is that branch of philosophy which attempts todetermine when a given statement or group of statementspermit some other statement to be verified.As a strict academic discipline logic attempts todistinguish verifiable inferences from inconclusive ones.It is approached through a comparison of statements,drawing conclusions from both knowledge andobservation according to one or more of three processes:deduction, induction, and abduction:a. DeductionDeduction draws firm conclusions from two or morefacts whose combination inescapably leads to thoseconclusions.Obvious care must be taken to ensure that theconstituent facts are themselves valid, and that theapplied conjunction is an appropriate, material one. Alltoo often deductive conclusions are “set ups”: theapparently-reasonable, even indisputable outcome fromselectively-staged or -weighted “facts”. In such casesdeductive logic is merely a device to lend conclusions a- 47 -veracity and inevitability which the raw data do notjustify.b. InductionInduction seeks to draw probable conclusions frominconclusive information and/or sources of varyingreliability. The result is thus a judgment-call by theevaluator.Deduction is obviously preferable to induction, butboth have their imperfections: deduction in the case of ill-chosen determinants, and induction in overreaching thebasis or significance of the input information.Even more in the case of induction there is apropensity for predetermining a desired conclusion bystaging the “analysis”.c. AbductionAbduction, the most precarious of the three, involvesthe critical comparison of two or more deductions andinductions on the basis of plausibility.Abduction thus has two inherent weaknesses: relianceupon pre-flawed deduction or induction, and evaluationon the basis of plausibility, not truth per se. This secondfailing recalls what Plato warned against as the“democratization of truth”, in which reality is establishedon the basis of popular sentiment rather than impersonalfact. The former is the province of demagoguery and whatPlato disparaged as “sophism”; the latter characteristic ofphilosophers and dialectic reasoning.2. Logical FallaciesIn addition to the hazards of logic stemming fromeither careless or weighted material from which to- 48 -deduce, induce, or abduce, there are a number of fallacieswhich may appear, again either innocently ormanipulatively, within a logical exercise itself. TheMWarrior will need to be alert for them accordingly,including possibly within his own analytic efforts if he isinattentive to his own biases and assumptions.Recall that the logician does not talk with reference totruth, ideals, or morality, but rather in terms ofverification and proof. There are eleven specificinvalidations that apply to these objectives:a. Quoting Out-of-ContextExtremely common in contemporary news reportingand commentary, this technique extracts a passage,sentence, or larger statements or writings which by itselfmay seem to have one meaning when, contained withinits complete utterance, may mean something quitedifferent, even contradictory.More subtly, and more proliferate in academia,policies and statements which may have served adesirable or necessary purpose in, say, the midst of WorldWar II, can appear extrme, insensitive, unjust in laterpeacetime.The “internment of enemy aliens” following PearlHarbor is a classic example - as would be old practices ofracial, religious, ethnic, or gender discrimination hereand elsewhere.This vulnerability highlights the importance ofcontext itself as an analytical factor. An ideology orgovernmental structure which Americans may considerthe “height of civilization” for themselves may beregarded as nothing of the sort in other countries orgeographic areas. The blind advocacy of “democracy”sounds appealing on its face, but imposed on a culturewith rampant illiteracy and a mood of mob-desperation- 49 -throughout its “electorate” could presage disaster. It isvital for MW solutions to be contextually tailored to thepeople directly impacted, not to the preferences of distantdo-gooders.b. Sentimental ArgumentAttempts to “prove” a statement by citing itspopularity are invalid. While this should seem self-evident, it is both more prevalent and more insidious inpractice, invoking as it does the consolation of “commonsense”.At the time of this writing the United States isconvulsed in argument over “illegal aliens” aka“undocumented immigrants”. The very phraseologypredetermines the tone of the debate, of course.Both proponents and opponents appeal to sentiment:sympathy for the downtrodden simply seeking a better,safer life; vs. protection and preservation of the UnitedStates’ somewhat nebulous image as a “NormanRockwell” enclave perhaps realized only on Main Streetin Disneyland. Authentic logic should eschew bothemotions and focus rather on the economic andpopulation-density changes accompanying open, closed,or varying-controlled national borders. Related,obviously, is the question of what if anything to do aboutaccumulated past inattention to these questions:deportation, amnestic assimilation, or some hybrid ofboth. Either way sentiment, while tempting andcompelling, can only hinder a logical resolution.c. Authoritarian ArgumentAttempting to prove a statement by citing adistinguished or important person or institution whoendorses it is logically invalid.- 50 -This is a sort of stratified variation of the“democratization of truth” fallacy, attempted in ahierarchical or privileged environment.In extreme situations it also refers to proclamations of“fact” by dictators, military commanders, “infallible”popes, and similar personages or institutions in aposition of coercive authority. In George Orwell’s 1984“reality” is what the Party decrees it is, and any dissentwhatever is “thoughtcrime”.Here it may be well to point out that it is just as mucha logical fallacy to “disprove” something because it isembraced by authority or tradition: the unsupportableextreme of nihilism.d. AmbiguityAmbiguity refers to words, phrases, or statementswhich were intended to mean one thing but arerepresented as meaning something else, for the deliberatepurpose of “proving” a position or proposition.To be a “defender of life” is a rallying-call amongopponents of abortion, while quite obviously the phrasein an of itself extends far beyond that application.Additionally, of course, “life” itself is ambiguous as towhere it starts and stops, and of what it consists while inexistence.Many if not all of the “great questions” have anelement of ambiguity in them, particularly if either theirsubstance or their purpose is not generally or clearlyunderstood. What, for instance, is a “human right”? Whohas the power to grant and/or enforce it? Why should itapply to the human species exclusively and not to allother forms of natural life? Is it a mere convention, anagreed-upon human conceit within a limited audience?Or should it be limited to Aquinas’ Human Law, reflectiveof and dependent upon Divine Law for its authority?- 51 -e. InterdependenceTwo unproved statements cannot be used to proveone another.Classical philosophers have enjoyed a field dayplaying with paradoxes and “vicious circles” of conceptualimpossibility. “Roger Rabbit maintains that all rabbits areliars.”: Are we to believe this statement?Less entertainingly, nations routinely claim that theyare forced into war by another’s “threat”, and that the“threat” is proved by that nation’s armed retaliation. The“logic” of the war is thus established. No, it isn’t: Theinitial perception of “threat” may have been innocentlymistaken, or not-so-innocently fabricated, even to theextent of a “false flag” provocation-excuse.Within FF evaluation there is a further dynamicdimension involved. A provocative or triggering incidencecannot be considered in time-discrete isolation. Itsmotives and origins must be traced back through time,which one quickly realizes is a beginningless history ofvenge and revenge.Thus Nazi Germany is understandable only in theaftermath of the Versailles Treaty, whose harshness isexplained by the perceived grievances of the victors inWorld War I, whose origins came from ... ad infinitum.It is because of this principle that MW does not seek“justice [for the past]” in its solutions, but rather anáristos that is forward-oriented.f. SignificanceSome statements are accurate only when viewedtogether with other statements concerning the samesubject.One example was introduced above: the internment ofethnic Japanese in the United States during World War- 52 -II. By itself this would seem inhumane and racist.However there was an extremely harsh war underwaywith Japan, and not all Japanese residing in the UnitedStates were U.S. citizens. Even some who were had astrong affinity for Japan and quasi-religious loyalty to theperson of the Emperor. Nor were Japan’s wartimeintentions towards the United States at all clear: ThePearl Harbor attack seemed to signal territorialaggression similar to that of Japan’s incursion into Asia;no one could be certain. If the internment was laterdeemed to be excessive and unneeded, that is decidedlywith the 20/20 vision of hindsight.g. Argumentum ad IgnorantiumIt is illogical to say that a given statement is true justbecause there is no evidence to disprove it.Just because Bigfoot or a Yeti has not yet beencaptured, or a corpse discovered, does not prove thatsuch creatures don’t exist. Since their existence has thusnot be disproven, it stands to reason that they do in factexist.Well, no. All that it establishes is that this questionlacks sufficient data to be answered one way or the otherat this point in time.In the political situations addressed by MW, somemay well prove to be unresolvable at this time because ofkey lacunæ: information which is essential but not yetavailable. This may necessitate active measures in on-location intelligence by MetaForce Branch, and/oradditional research by ParaPolitics Branch. Either way acampaign should not be developed or implemented untilthe necessary gaps have been filled.- 53 -h. Composition and DivisionWhat is true of the whole is not necessarily true of theparts, and vice-versa.Czarist Russia gradually built up an empire of severalvassal states, which after the communist revolutionbecame the Soviet Union. Following the Allied victory inWorld War II, additional Soviet suzerainty prevailedthroughout the Warsaw Pact - as, arguably, was also thereality with United States domination over the NATOalliance in the West.The situation has further complicated following thecollapse of Soviet communism and dissolution of theU.S.S.R., and corresponding Western efforts to re-justifyNATO, even to the extent of projecting it far into southAsia such as Afghanistan.Meanwhile efforts to make sense of new/old nationssuch as Ukraine are confusing to say the least. Someelements advocate more separation from Russia and eveninclusion in NATO, while others prefer something closerto the old Soviet Union.Great Britain is currently going through the manycomplexities of disengagement from the EuropeanCommunity, which is further complicated by one of itsown components, Scotland, reconsidering whether toextricate itself from the United Kingdom in order toremain in the EC.These are but two examples of time/space-layeredproblems whose solutions depend upon what scope ofcomplication they are required to address.i. Ignoratio ElenchiThis occurs, sometimes amusingly, when a personproclaims that he is going to prove something, thenactually proves something irrelevant to the claim.- 54 -In 1492 Columbus set out from Spain to prove that ifhe sailed westward long enough, he would reach India. Asit happened, what he reached was the Western, not theEastern Hemisphere, though that didn’t stop him fromclaiming success and clinching it by calling the localinhabitants “Indians”.j. Non SequiturArguments which do not logically substantiate theircontentions. This can be by simple imprecision inreasoning, or by intentional effort to sell a desired butunsubstantiated conclusion.A well-known current example would be that humansare responsible for global warming because greenhousegasses contribute to global warming and humanscontribute to greenhouse gasses. Here the non-sequitur isthat global warming is not caused exclusively or evenprimarily by greenhouse gasses, nor are greenhousegasses exclusively or primarily caused by human beings.Such non-sequitur s are ignored by activists whose goal isto attack the fossil-fuel industry; prior to “globalwarming” they simply sought other alarmist rationales,such as natural resource devastation or accidentcontamination. [This is not a condemnation ofenvironmental activism per se, but only an observationconcerning its facile resort to emotional overstatement.]k. Argumentum ad HominemAttempting to disprove something by attacking theauthor or proponent is logically invalid.Consider this statement:When one says that God provokes the lightning, that’strue in a sense; but what is certain is that God does not directthe thunderbolt, as the church claims. The church’s- 55 -explanation of natural phenomena is an abuse, for thechurch has ulterior interests. True piety is the characteristicof the being who is aware of his weakness and ignorance.Whoever sees God only in an oak tree or a tabernacle,instead of seeing him everywhere, is not truly pious. Heremains attached to appearances - and when the skythunders and the lightning strikes, he trembles simply fromfear of being struck as a punishment for the sin he’s justcommitted.From now on, one may consider that there is no gapbetween the organic and inorganic worlds. Recentexperiments make it possible for one to wonder whatdistinguishes live bodies from inanimate matter. In the faceof this discovery, the church will begin by rising in revolt;then it will continue to teach its “truths”. One day, finally,under the battering ram of science, dogma will collapse. It islogical that it should be so, for the human spirit cannotremorselessly apply itself to raising the veil of mysterywithout people’s one day drawing the conclusions.The Ten Commandments are a code of living towhich there’s no refutation. These precepts correspondto irrefragable needs of the human soul; they’re inspired bythe best religious spirit, and the churches here supportthemselves on a solid foundation. 6Before glancing at the footnote to see who said this,consider whether or not it favorably impresses you, and ifso whether it makes any difference who voiced thisopinion.This will serve to illustrate the degree of colorationwhich the source of a statement places upon it in the eyesof audiences who are conditioned to accept or rejectanything from that source.Pure logic evaluates statements regardless of source,on their content and merit alone.6 Hitler, Adolf, remarks to Lieutenant General von Rintelen on theevening of October 24, 1941. Hitler’s Table Talk 1941-1944, Cameron& Stevens translation from Martin Bormann’s transcripts.- 56 -3. The Lesson of LogicAuthentic reflective thinking is a far cry from the mereconjuring of vague opinions - upon which unfortunatelymost conventional “political analysis” is actually based.All too often we are [mis]treated to the spectacle ofpolicies, positions, and actions whose only basis is thewhim or prejudice of the decision-maker, with“supporting facts” being cherry-picked, taken out-of-context, or even brazenly invented to fit the stepsister’sfoot. Clearly such sloppiness, stupidity, and/ordishonesty is completely unacceptable in FF - and in MWgenerally.This long list of cautions about “thinking errors” mayappear painfully excessive to a readership, indeed an ageof “civilization” comfortably accustomed to havingopinions with either no or the most flimsy and self-serving justifications. This is scarcely a new problem; itwas the point of the entire corpus of Plato’s Dialogues toexpose it in the Athens of his day, and forcefully argue fora rigorous, factual, and honest alternative to thisprevalent, popular sophistry. Socrates’ thanks for thisembarrassing message was condemnation to death.Did he himself still comprehend this, this mostintrospective of all philosophers? Was this what he said tohimself at the end, in the wisdom of his courage to die?Socrates wanted to die: It was not Athens, but he himselfwho chose the hemlock; he forced Athens to sentence him.“Socrates is no physician,” he said softly to himself. “Heredeath alone is the physician. Socrates himself has merelybeen a long time sick.” 7In subsequent millennia Socrates’ hemlocktailchanged first into burning alive at the stake, and in ourown “Postmodern” décadence to more decorous if just as7 Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols (1889).- 57 -terminal media-blacklisting, academic tenure-denial, andsimilar “shoot the messengerisms”.Proposing and conducting MW campaigns would beever so much more welcome among policy-makers, easierto conduct, and flattering to memorialize if MW wereallowed to participate in this same farce of comfortableand convenient self-deception. It must always refuse thissirens’ song.E. FF ContinuumA continuum is a coherent whole characterized as acollection, sequence, or progression of values or elementsvarying by minute degrees.Therefore the application of FF to a given problemsituation generates a continuum embracing it from apresent reflection to a future áristos reflection, connectedthrough time by a reverse-engineered MW campaign. Aslong as due care is taken with each of the components,the entire continuum is not only surprisingly easy butinevitable and infallible, because the continuum is notonly comprehensive but self-adjusting in its progression.Before proceeding to its implementation, it isnecessary to more closely examine its most crucialdimension: time.- 58 -[index-59_1.jpg]- 59 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2: TIMEThe present is the ever-moving shadow that dividesyesterday from tomorrow. In that lies hope.- Frank Lloyd Wright[Upon hearing of Daylight Saving Time] Only thewhite man would believe that you could cut a piecefrom the top of a blanket, sew it to the bottom of thatblanket, and have a longer blanket.- Allowat Sakima, Chief of the Lenni-LenapeA. The Fourth DimensionChapter #1 introduced reflections, each consisting ofthree dimensions in space, connected and individuallyelasticized by a fourth: time (or duration). It is theexistence of this fourth dimension (4D) that changespolitical problems and their solutions from static todynamic, making them truly intelligible only as continua.The MWarrior, the FF investigator, must accordinglyindwell these continua if he is to correctly perceive andadjust reality.And so what exactly is that mysterious, elusive 4D? Itis with us constantly, inescapably, yet we cannot see, feel,touch, hear, or otherwise apprehend it through ournatural senses. So this chapter proposes to expose thisghostly god: to transform it from controlling to- 60 -controlled, and ultimately to illuminate the Valley of theShadow of Death which is its domain.B. Definition1. Ding Nicht An SichTime itself does not exist at all. It is something whichexists only apart from itself, in the eyes and intelligenceof a distinct consciousness. It is the language by whichthat external consciousness detects, estimates, measures,and compares the changes of and between existentialphenomena displacing the three dimensions of physicalextension in space. In principle, if there were no suchchanges, time would, and could, not exist.2. KantThis interpretation of time was most famouslyarticulated by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant(1724-1804), who in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781)contended that space (Dimensions 1-3) ant time(Dimension 4) are independent of, yet dependent uponone another to make them sensible concepts. Summarily:• Different times are successive, notcoexistent.• Different spaces are coexistent, notsuccessive.In other words, time is necessarily a measurementof elapse, which can exist only as a sequence, acontinuum.As for spatial objects or defined areas [of emptiness],they necessarily displace a single “point in time”, more- 61 -precisely a “moment without time” in order to beabsolute in themselves: Two 3Ds cannot displace thesame locus simultaneously.3D space, Kant argued, is objective, that isindependent of external perception.Time, on the other hand, is subjective: It exists onlyin the mind of an external perceptive consciousness (5D),as an arbitrary, convenient means of demarcatingchanges in 3Ds themselves, and/or compared to other3Ds. That time has the illusion of objectivity is merelybecause of conventions among perceivers as to a commonstandard of such measurement, such as a “minute” or“hour” based upon the Earth’s solar orbit.3. EinsteinThis simple and self-evident distinction of Kant’swould be attacked by Albert Einstein in his confusingly-named “theory of relativity”, in which he insisted againstall sanity that time is not a subjective relationship but anobjective constant, thus mandating rigidly-calculatedabsurdities such as an everywhere-fixed velocity of light:leading to such derivative preposterities as “curvedspace” and “black holes”. Eventually Pavlovian sciencewill extricate itself from this tar-baby, or so one can onlyhope.4. NoumenonSince time is an arbitrarily-assigned valuation, Kantcontinues, it is not empirical: It is not gained or learnedfrom observation of natural phenomena. Rather it is apriori; it is assigned to objective phenomena, including,significantly, before and after they occur. Such conceptswould not be possible in a genuinely-empiricalenvironment.- 62 -5. Objective Universal DynamicThe natural, or more precisely objective universe (OU)of matter and energy [including their balancing/offsetting anti- counterparts] is, completely andcontinuously, changing. This change permeates the OUfrom the quark to the metagalactic, and the first questionis why this should be so. Why shouldn’t the OU beeverywhere static, a motionless “manifestation of death”?Why is it everywhere “restless”?Further, why is this “restlessness” itself an OU-law,functioning uniformly everywhere? Science-fictionauthors and mathematically-enthralled physicists haveplayed with time-violations of various whimsy: warps,distortions, worm- & black-holes, jumps, alternate OUs,and of course the ubiquitous time-travel [as a sort of 4DMöbius strip8 or Klein bottle9]. As entertaining as these fictional shortcutsand band-aids may be, they remainnothing more than that, to the inevitable, inescapablefrustration and fury of the Einstein-gullible. [The still-enshrined “theories of relativity” demystify to meresillyscience puffery of the prosaic fact that perceivers ofchanging objects simultaneously change in and betweenthemselves - according to the very same OU-laws.]8 The Möbius strip is a non-orientable surface with only one side andonly one boundary [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology)]. It iseasy to create by taking a ribbon of paper, twisting one end 180°, and attachingit to the other end. It would beinteresting to hear Chief Allowat’s comments concerning suchtopological impudence.9 The Klein bottle is a non-orientable surface; it is a 2D manifoldagainst which a system for determining a normal vector cannot beconsistently defined. Informally, it is a one-sided surface which, iftraveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin whileflipping the traveler upside down. Offered the experience, ChiefAllowat declines such an indignity.- 63 -C. History, or “Reality Control”Before proceeding into the consideration of time as ameans for comprehending the present and controlling thefuture, it will be useful to examine how it has been usedand misused retrospectively:The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliancewith Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania hadbeen in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four yearsago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his ownconsciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated.And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed - ifall records told the same tale - then the lie passed intohistory and became truth. “Who controls the past,” ran theParty slogan, “controls the future; who controls the presentcontrols the past.” And yet the past, though of its naturealterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true nowwas true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple.All that was needed was an unending series of victories overyour own memory. “Reality control” they called it; inNewspeak “doublethink”.10“History” is something we can count on as a standardof morality, as hard evidence of truth, as bedrock amidstour whirling contemporary environment of uncertainties,right?Wrong. Historical accounts are written by humanbeings with widely-varying backgrounds, perspectives,motives, and paychecks. Even given perfect, immediateaccess to all information about an event, no two peoplewill describe it, or its significance, in the same way. Andin historical research there is almost never access to allrelevant information to begin with.Daniel J. Boorstin is Librarian of Congress Emeritus,and is a distinguished scholar and Pulitzer Prize winnerwho has authored many superb historical analyses. In his10 Orwell, George, 1984. New York: Signet Books, 1949, page #32.- 64 -Hidden History he proposes several laws that shape whatwe know as “history”:11(1) The Law of the Survival of theUnreadThere is a natural and inevitabletendency toward the destruction anddisappearance of documents mostwidely used; therefore there is aninverse relationship between theprobability of a document survivingand its value as evidence of the dailylife of the age from which it survives.(2) Survival of the Durable and ThatWhich is neither Removed norDisplacedTombs, burial objects, mummies,temples, churches, and pyramids tendto skew our view of the past. Theygive a prominence to religion in therelics of the past which it may notactually have had in the lives peoplelived.(3) Survival of the Collected and theProtected= What goes in government files. Weemphasize political history andgovernment in the life of the pastpartly because governments keeprecords while families and otherinformal groups seldom do.11 Boorstin, Daniel J., Hidden History: Exploring Our Secret Past.New York: Vintage Books, 1989.- 65 -(4) Survival of Objects Which arenot Used or Which Have a HighIntrinsic ValueIt is not only in printed matter thatrarity and scarcity induce survival.Treasured or hoarded artifactsfrequently survive where commonly-used, more representative ones donot.(5) Survival of the AcademicallyClassifiable and the DignifiedTeachers teach the subjects in whichthey have been instructed.(6) Survival of Documents whichPertain to ControversiesWhat often passes for the history of apractice, belief, or institution is moreaccurately the history of controversiesabout it.(7) Survival of the Self-Serving: ThePsycho-Pathology of Diaristsand Letter-WritersHistorians are urged to seek recordsby participants in events, preferablythose made at the time or soonthereafter. Such are often self-servingand egotistical at the expense ofobjectivity.(8) Survival of the Victorious Pointof View: The Success BiasIf an invention, trend, or point of viewprevailed, it and its proponents are- 66 -assumed to be representative ratherthan failed or minority alternatives.(9) Survival of the EpiphenomenalPeople often write and read booksbecause they cannot personallyexperience what is described. It isoften uncertain whether a writer isrecording or escaping an experience.(10) Knowledge Survives and will beaccumulated over Time, butIgnorance DisappearsThe mind of the modern historian hasaccess to the accumulated knowledgeand experience of the ages since theperiod of the past he is trying torecapture, but for this reason hecannot see reality as the people of thattime saw it.What are the implications of this for the MWarrior? Itmeans that:• All of the historical sources you consult areincomplete, inaccurate, biased, and/orincompetent to some degree.•• You yourself are in the grip of tacitprejudices and presuppositions which youhave never questioned or even acknowledgedas anything to be questioned.You can compensate for #• by going outside “blessed”history sources to others, including those of the“enemy” (then or now) in order to examine the events in- 67 -question from as many perspectives as possible. You cancompensate for #•• by consulting third parties -including the “enemy” (then or now) - for theirassessments of the issue, which you can then evaluatealong with your own towards that eventual, vitalobjectivity.D. Patterns1. OU-Reality ConstructionMindWar introduced and emphasized the significanceof “pattern thinking”, by which the subconscioushuman mind constructs, maintains, and adjusts “models”or “benchmarks” of what is assumed to be ObjectiveUniverse (OU) -real [as opposed to Subjective Universe(SU) -imaginary].It is the presence of such patterns, which more-or-lessinterlock into a “coherent whole”, that enables humans tofunction in the OU, including between themselves.Subconscious pattern-thinking utilizes approximately95% of human thinking, relegating what humans regardas conscious, or “algorithmic”, thinking to the remaining5%. 12 Subconscious patterns, significantly, are not inthemselves dynamic; they are “3D snapshots” of realitycompositions, not 4D “storylines” [through time].2. In/Sanitya. ExposéIndividuals without such thought-patterns, or withones inconsistent with socially common/endorsed ones,12 Cf. Leonard Mlodinow, Ph.D., Subliminal: How Your UnconsciousMind Rules Your Behavior (New York: Pantheon, 2012).- 68 -or discretely-changing ones, are classified [by society-anointed “reality authorizers” such as psychiatrists andconventionally-sanctioned-religious clergy] as “insane”.“Sanity” is established by an individual’s agreementwith the generally-approved pattern of OU-reality;inability or refusal to endorse this established-consensusis deemed to be a “breakaway” from it, schizophrenia.In fact, apart from physical brain injury or illness,there are many reasons why an individual’s thought-patterns may not mirror socially-proclaimed ones.Actually no two individuals share precisely or even closelythe same sensory perceptions, so “sanity” is moreaccurately a trained, conditioned individual conformity tosocial expectations. It cannot be called true connectionwith the OU; rather what humans consider “OU-reality”is more properly described as an officially-agreed-uponcommon SU-image of the OU.b. The Ministry of LoveIn 1984 George Orwell’s society-spokesman O’Brienadmonished the recalcitrant Winston Smith:You are here in the Ministry of Love because you havefailed to control your memory. You have failed in humility, inself-discipline. You would not make the act of submissionwhich is the price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, aminority of one.Only the disciplined mind can see reality.You believe that reality is something objective, external,existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature ofreality is self-evident. When you delude yourself intothinking that you see something, you assume that everyoneelse sees the same thing as yourself.But I tell you that reality is not external. Reality exists inthe human mind and nowhere else. Not in the individualmind, which can make mistakes and in any case soonperishes, but in the mind of the Party which is collective andimmortal.- 69 -Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth. It isimpossible to see reality except by looking through the eyesof the Party.That is the fact that you have got to relearn. It needs anact of self-destruction, an effort of the will. You must humbleyourself before you can become sane. 13As will be evident from the preceding discussion,O’Brien’s elucidation was by no means just dramatic-fictional exaggeration, appropriate to dismiss right afterits tickle.The only difference between Orwell’s world and oursis that the environment of Oceania and its Party is muchsimpler and more overt in its demands and punishments.In contemporary actual society there is still the sameimplicit expectation that “sane” people passively andautomatically embrace the proclaimed, established, andenforced “Collective Subjective Universe” (CSU). UnlikeOrwell’s capital-punishment “Thoughtcrime” intolerance,consequences range from mere indulgence as an“eccentric” to ostracism or confinement as “insane”.Specific consequences reflect the perceived severity ofCSU-challenge by the individual in question.c. “00Ψ”: License to InstillPolitical CSUs differ from culture to culture, nation tonation. Where ordinary socialization appears inadequate,they are enforced by conventional, crude thought-controlsuch as propaganda.The identification of propaganda and similarthought-control devices, from the mildest commercialadvertising to unendurable physical/mental stress( 1984’s “Room 101”) is the initiatory education ofgovernmental Psychological Operations (PSYOP)13 1984, op. cit., pages #205-6.- 70 -professionals. An unspoken but very real element of suchtraining is that the officer must ultimately not onlybecome aware of his and others’ societal “matrix” [as inthe celebrated science-fiction film of that name], but stepoutside of all such CSUs [thus “taking the red pill”] inorder to manipulate them. The risk is that, once entrustedwith such “00-license”, he will be unreliably free from hisown, not just others’ matrix. Conventional PSYOPofficers, while indeed suspect and mistrusted in thisregard, are paradoxically not eliminated outright becausethey are also considered only peripherally competent intheir craft.MindWar as revealed and detailed in this series ofbooks - MindWar, MindStar, and now FindFar - is veryobviously a complete game-changer. The initiatedMWarrior, like Caine receiving the Shaolin brands of thedragon & tiger in Kung Fu, now posses thought-controlskill of a literally divine potency. Were profane society torealize this, his life would be instantly forfeit. Fortunatelythe true significance of MW is far beyond theconceptualization of the “unbranded”, as well it shouldand must remain: An entire world rampant with suchknowledge would be not an opportunity for enlightenedáristos or kalokagathia, but an orgiastic apocalypse ofevil: the id-monster of Forbidden Planet triumphant.E. MemoryMemory is the “past” 4D function of human thought-architecture, and exists exclusively in the conscious 5% ofalgorithmic thinking. [Subconscious patterns maycontain elements of past experiences, of course, butthemselves have no 4D-depth.]Conventional, traditional efforts to communicate withand convince others in a sociopolitical environment havebeen overwhelmingly limited to argumentative appeals- 71 -and exhortations to this conscious 5%, which is preciselywhy, as MindWar demonstrates, they never work.Throughout human history, from antiquity to thebeleaguered 21st-century, only a few fragments ofintended information reach their audiences, and eventhese are mostly misunderstood and quickly forgotten.Why? Again the answer is found in thought-architecture,specifically with regard to humans’ processing ofconscious, “episodic” memory.1. AttentionYou’ve got only six minutes to make your point. 14And that’s only if and after you’ve gotten youraudience’s attention in the first place - which, in the Ageof the Internet - is often limited to the time/space of oneor two sentences. 15So insists Ron Hoff, one of the advertising industry’smost effective representatives. 16So what’s magic about “six minutes”? That, arguesHoff, is the effective attention-limit of an audience in anypresentation setting such as a classroom, auditorium, or14 Hoff, Ron, Say It in Six: How to Say Exactly What You Mean in 6Minutes or Less. Kansas City, MO: Andrews McMeel Publishing,1996.15 There is no more dramatic illustration of this than the worldwide,spectacular success of “Twitter”, a medium of Internet sound-bites.In 2016 the United States, traditionally the preserve of long-windedspeechifying, arguably elected its next President, Donald Trump, onthe effectiveness of his “tweets” - which, in his administration, willpresumably obsolesce Franklin Roosevelt’s famous, but intolerablyslow “fireside chats”.16 In addition to conducting hundreds of nationwide presentations,Hoff has been a frequent contributor on communicationeffectiveness to media such as the New York Times, the Wall StreetJournal, and the Chicago Tribune.- 72 -conference room. Beyond that listeners’ thoughts begin towander and retention of further points evaporates.Therefore, he advises, condense the most importantpoints - the ones you really want the audience to “takeaway” with them - into those precious first-six. If you feelthe need for elaboration, provide a handout, write apaper, publish a book.Unfortunately most people don’t know how to writeeffectively either, which cripples if not nullifies any suchplatform. As with speaking, a document has only a briefshot at a reader’s attention, so if you want him tocontinue past the dust-jacket teaser, you’d better learnthe ropes and lasso him forthwith.Effective writing, like effective speaking, has suffereda lingering starvation in the American educational desert.What was once drilled into high school students is now ararity even at the university level. Fortunately the artsurvives in a few epistolary enclaves, and also in bookssuch as the life-preserver I habitually toss to thefrantically-floundering: How to Write by Herbert & JillMeyer. 17 Like SIi6, HtW is a very slim book; both of them exemplify their ownadvice and do not waste either theirpages or your eyes. If you want to maximize youreffectiveness with this book, gobble both of those andkeep each one on your bookshelf alongside it. Do it now.2. RetentionAttention is only half the battle; the other half isensuring that your recipients, whether audience orreadership, not only remembers your message but doesso accurately.17 Meyer, Herbert E. & Jill M., How to Write: Communicating Ideasand Information. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1994.- 73 -While subconscious thought-patterns tend to be rigidand permanent [as for example the significance of red/yellow/green traffic lights], conscious memory iscomparatively brief and unreliable, even when sincere,serious concentration is attempted.This frustratingly fickle conscious memory is knownas episodic memory, since it is characterized by the“storyline” of 4D consciousness rather than the“snapshot” of 3D subconsciousness.Ominously - especially in the context of politicalcomplexities and conflicts - this unreliability is notaccompanied by a corresponding individual attitude ofuncertainty. To the contrary, humans tend to cling toemotionally-cherished beliefs regardless of howobjectively unsupportable they may be, until/unlessirrefutable disproofs or contradictions are presented.Even then there is a tendency to avoid unpalatablerefutations: to “not see” them or just change the subject. 18Just how pervasive is this episodic unreliability? Inone study cited by the RAND Corporation:Weinshall had 34 executives in an industrialorganization record their daily interactions for a two-weekperiod. He found that 75% of the reported interactionsregistered in the mind of one party only. Of the 25% ofcommunications which were mutually remembered a fewhours after their occurrence, 53% were not understood bythe recipient in the spirit intended by the transmitter. Thusof the total interactions reported, only 12% “got through”. 1918 In his searing satire 1984 George Orwell portrayed a then-fantastic,now all-too-extant political culture in which politically-incorrectopinions are neutralized through “doublethink”, or which in extremecases condemn the luckless “thought-criminal” to extermination andobliteration as an “unperson”.19 Archibald, K.A., Three Views of the Expert’s Role in Policy-Making. Santa Monica: RAND Corporation, 1970.- 74 -The key to retention is a corollary to the principles ofSIi6 and HtW: clear, undiluted, and well-substantiated“take-away” points.3. IdentityMemory is also a key element of identity, theconscious awareness of unique selfhood. One of thetraditional distinctions of humankind from other animalshas been that non-humans live in a “perpetual present” ofstimulus/response-only, and thus are not consciousentities. They experience 3D pattern-recognition, but not4D “episodic” memory. 20 A cruelly-convenientextrapolation of this excuses reducing them to merecommodities which may be exploited, mistreated, andkilled without conscience. Such a rationale iscontemptuously callous on its face, amounting tonothing more than a judgment on the basis of non-verbalization rather than authentic non-feeling. It is yetanother example of humans’ propensity to refuse toconfront shameful or frustrating inconveniences.Just as identity of self is validated by 4D continuity, soare external phenomena. Cultures, nations, ethnicgroups, and memori-als such as symbols and structuressecure and sustain 4D (historical) significance to theextent they not only persist in their presence but areacknowledged by others. A revolution such as that of theUnited States is validated not just by its own assertion [asin military victory, the Constitution, etc.] but by itsrecognition in the international community. Historyabounds with examples of both successes and failures inthis regard; at this writing the Islamic Stateconspicuously struggles to shed the dismissives of “self-20 Cf. Victoria L. Templer & Robert R. Hampton, “Episodic Memoryin Nonhuman Animals”, Currnt Biology, September 29, 2013:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799964/- 75 -proclaimed” and “so-called”. Conquerors regularly denythe “full-humanity” of the conquered, thus permittingtheir enslavement, expropriation, or extermination. Inthe most extreme and horrific instances, Orwell’s 1984prescription of “reality control” attempts to erase eventhe previous existence of a vanquished victim. 21 Asdramatized by H.P. Lovecraft in his account of a NewEngland eccentric murdered by his intolerant neighbors:From that time on the obliteration of Curwen’s memorybecame increasingly rigid, extending at last by commonconsent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. Itcan be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on OscarWilde’s name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extentonly to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in LordDunsany’s tale, whom the Gods decided must not only ceaseto be, but must cease ever to have been.22F. AnticipationThe forward-looking counterpart to memorymanifests in two general modes: passive and active.1. ForecastingPassively predicting or estimating the future course ofevents is called forecasting. FF begins with forecastingto establish a point of reference for the course of eventsabsent active measures such as a MW campaign.Forecasting is discussed in detail in Chapter #3.21 Cf. #C above.22 Lovecraft, H.P., The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, 1927.- 76 -2. ForeshapingActively conceiving and controlling the future maytake many forms, from modest adjustment of existinginfluences to ambitious social or even planetaryengineering. When a MW campaign employs FF actively,to conceive, evaluate, and implement an áristos, it iscalled foreshaping. This concept is explained andexpanded in Chapter #4.G. ModelsTime has also been interpreted as one of severalmodels or frameworks by which humans measure theirexperience and understanding of the 4D. Interestinglythese are not mutually-exclusive, and indeed can beapplied cooperatively.1. CircularProbably the most ancient model of time is that it, asan indicator of natural change, moves in a continuouscircle, the most obvious example of which being therotating/repeating Sun every day and Moon every month,and beyond these the entire “stellar canopy” of theZodiac.Today, when one is engulfed in a linear-timeenvironment, it requires an extraordinary effort ofvacation to imagine the experience of conscious lifewithin “circular nature”. Very possibly mankind’s firstsense of alienation from nature, of being a “thing apart”,was the realization that living beings did not participatein this endless, immortal circularity. Rather they werecursed, so it must have seemed, with linear finiteness: aunidirectional, inescapable trudge to death andobliteration. Worship of nature, of its gods or God, was- 77 -nothing less than an appeal for a presumed re-inclusionin “lost” divine circularity: the Garden of Eden in whicheverything rotated but nothing changed.In all religious, mythical, and fictional depictions ofparadise, Heaven, or otherwise realms of the gods/God,the keystone characteristic is deathlessness byassimilation into unchanging circularity: consciousnessverified by individual movement remains, but safelywithin eternal repetition.To this day conventional religions promote thiswistful hope, though in an OU everywhere awash inentropy, it is a concept ever more elusive for even itssproponents to visualize.2. CyclicalAgain early in mankind’s efforts to understand naturallaw, it was noticed that some events do not appear toexactly and endlessly repeat themselves, but do occur andrecur at regular intervals, characterizing cycles. At theirsimplest, such cycles were identified in naturalenvironments such as weather, rivers, and ocean currentsand tides. Within the immediate human experience, andcrucial to its continuation, were female fertility cycles.Throughout recorded history the study of cycles hasbecome ever more elaborate, extending even to the worldof economics, as in the behavior of securities markets andthe famous Kondratieff Cycle of strength and weakness.In the realm of politics and conflict, alternationsbetween PhysWar and peace, cooperation and isolation,relaxation and tension recurrently supersede oneanother, but it is questionable whether such movementbetween extremes is authentically cyclical, or morehaphazardly just the irregular interplay of circumstances,strength, and weakness, both material and psychological.- 78 -3. LinearA linear approach to time began most famously withHebrew mythology, which postulated a fixed “Genesis”setting time in unidirectional motion, as well as a finalend when all of the Hebraic god’s interests are sated andhuman-inflicted tasks are completed. Such a fulfilling orcatastrophic universal terminus is theologically termed“eschatology”, and variations of it can be found inChristianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. Curiouslysuch “fixed. forced-march” pageants refuse to address theobvious lacunæ of what happened before the beginningor happens after the end.Eschatology is most useful as a religious doctrine tocompel human docility: Awaiting the obedient arepersonal posthumous rewards, while the disobedient faceunimaginable punishment. So such doctrines have bothan individual and a collective control-propagandausefulness.When Judæo-Christian mythology was discarded atthe time of the European Enlightenment23, the habit oflinear history persisted, with Georg Hegel substituting anincorporeal, impersonal “God as history” for the celestialanthropomorph. Now the flow of events - the dialectic -was seen to be “the mind of this god seeking to fullyunderstand itself through progressive ideas (thesis),their refutations (antithesis) and a resolving synthesis(which would thus become the successor thesis).This comforting logical progression was disdained byFriedrich Nietzsche, who asserted history to be a chaos of“blindness, madness, and injustice”. Post-Enlightenment23 The Enlightenment was a late-17th & 18th-century Europeanphilosophical, artistic, and scientific movement which, politically,proposed to replace secular monarchies with competing concepts ofpurely-human “social contracts” forcibly established, cooperativelynegotiated, or spontaneously arising from public sentiment.- 79 -humans could not seek justification by a divinely-orderedhistory, even Hegelian-abstract, but most grapple withunfolding events on a completely-discrete, case-by-casebasis.Nietzsche notwithstanding, modern society stillyearns for, and to a greater or lesser extent believes inevents “reflecting God’s will”, as well as human PhysWar“blessed [or at least excused] by God”, hence theproclamations, endorsements, absolutions, and otherantics from international church executives down tomilitary chaplains.4. RelationalAs this chapter establishes, actual time is nothingmore than a standardized measurement of change within,without, and between 3D “events”: objects or energies.There is in this standard no divine logic or law other thanits consistency and uniformity throughout the ObjectiveUniverse (OU). Thus time is a tool applicable only toNatural Law.Nor is time any semblance of an eschatologicalboundary, since it can be applied endlessly and limitlesslyinto the present, past, and future of Natural-Law events.For time to cease utility, the entire OU would have tounexist.What this establishes within the context of MW andFF, is that considerations of 4D are measurementtools only, with no divine or other moral aspectswhatever.That said, the discerning MWarrior will be well-awarethat conventional human PhysWar antagonists oftenenslave themselves to “divine purposes, expectations, orcommands”, thereby motivating their populations andarmies as well as themselves. This enthrallment generates- 80 -a MW PSYCON (Religion #13) vulnerability, which canthus be exploited as a powerful control device.H. Time=God(s)The culmination of Chapter #2 may come as asurprise, even a shock to readers. Reflect24 upon it,however, and it will fall quite calmly and unremarkablyinto place:Systematically, incre-mentally this chapter has led tothe disarmingly-simple identification, indeed exposé of4D as the actuality behind all concepts andimages of an OU God/the gods. In short, G/g equateto the totality of manifestations of change in the OU,within/without/between 3D matter/energy events. Thereis no possible conceptual manifestation otherwise.The purpose of this statement is not to gratuitouslyshock reader composure with a dramatic theologicalcoup. Understanding the actual mechanism of G/g doesnot in the least prevent or even discourage anyone’s beliefin G/g of choice, including endorsement of moralityassociated with that choice.What is important here is that the MWarrior not beignorant of that functional mechanism, so that its effectsupon both self and others can be identified and ifnecessary adjusted through appropriate combinations ofthe MW PSYCONs.Hence the task of the MWarrior is correspondinglysimple: Control time and you control G/g.More precisely, since the MWarrior conditions andadjusts humans in political situations, conflicts, andcrises, control their perception of G/g through controlof their perception of time/change in the OU.24 In the methodical, analytical discipline set forth in Chapter #1:D.- 81 -There is no need to assume or exercise an ostensiblyreligious role of any sort. Because of the actual identity ofG/g as time, just adjust the humans’ perception of time asnecessary and they themselves will transform it intowhichever of whatever G/g they worship and obey:theologic or symbolic.Harking back to Chapter #1, this is indeed a modernMachiavellian prescription. Accordingly there is in thistechnique no moral aspect or agenda; its object is simplyand directly the reduction, if not elimination of PhysWarmindless, unending, and excruciating mayhem in favor of“divinely mandated” relaxation and cooperation.The following chapters, therefore, explore how 4D canbe accurately identified and analyzed, and then howintelligent and constructive adjustments can be effected.I. xD: PerspectiveEstablishing that any or all OU phenomena requireand are identifiable in a complex of four OU dimensionsnecessitates that the perceiver be external to anddistinct from all of those dimensions, else he wouldnot be able to distinguish and differentiate each and all ofthem.This is the essence of the individual awareness of selfinherent in intelligent humanity. It exists, but neither in a1-3D OU spacial displacement nor as a slave to OU time/duration measurements (4D). It is in actuality OU-dimensionless and therefore OU-limitless. It exists onlyin and of itself, and has been clumsily identified inconventional cultures as the individual “soul”. It may beapprehended and examined in precise detail in thesecond book of this trilogy, MindStar. 2525 Aquino, Michael A., MindStar. San Francisco: Barony of Rachane,2016.- 82 -While at first realization this OU-externality ofindividual consciousness may come as a shock to readerspreviously assuming themselves to be merely beings ofand within the OU, once again the methodical exercise ofreflective thinking will substantiate and indeednecessitate the OU-alienation which true and completeperspective requires.When not dulled by habitual relaxation into passivephysical-sensory stimulus/response metabolism, humansare therefore pre-universal entities in and of themselves:in reality and accuracy “gods”.This is not some mystical or theological conceit. It isprescient recognition of what enables the human mind tocompletely perceive and analyze OU phenomena, as MWrequires.Indeed once the MWarrior acknowledges his god-existence, it becomes a non-concern; what is important isthe capacity for accurate perception and precise changethat this essence imparts.J. 5D: CreationOnce the existence and implications of xD arerecognized, there is a further realization, once again assimple and inevitable as the xD god’s passive powers:their active counterpart.Just as each fully-sentient human has the ability toapprehend and understand the entire OU, so it followsthat he can turn these same mental functions tospontaneous creativity: imagining and realizing newuniverses. Such are unique to each xD individual, henceare distinguishes as Subjective Universes (SU).Unlike the single [known] OU, SUs are a prerogativeof xD beings, not an establishment of law to which theyare enthralled as caretakers and preservers. Thus anindividual xD may create one, several, or no SUs, of- 83 -equally-arbitrary 4D laws. The impact of such laws canrange from the incidental to the maniacal, and from astability similar to that of the OU to infinite flexibility. AsRod Serling so presciently summarized - and correctly“dimensionalized” it:There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known toman. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless asinfinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow,between science and superstition, and it lies between the pitof man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is thedimension of imagination. It is an area which we call theTwilight Zone. 26K. FF ImplicationsLest the reader be unnerved by this Indiana Jonesjettison into strange dimensions and multiple universes,the point of this chapter is just to render coherent what isactually involved in the detection and evaluation ofsociopolitical incidents and episodes.This in turn clarifies what adjustments are possibleand by what means they may be effected.Finally the creative, generative capacity of the mindenables consideration of such adjustments to rangebeyond mere rearrangement of the known intoactualization and augmentation from the unknown.The next two chapters explore first the passiveperceptive and analytical process ( fortuna), then theactive measures by which corrective change is introduced( virtu/ occasione).26 Serling, Rod, original narrative introduction for The TwilightZone, 1959.- 84 -[index-85_1.jpg]- 85 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3: 3D FORECASTINGIndiana Jones: [stares at Sallah] You said theirheadpiece only had markings on one side.

Stasis RepresentationConventional analyses of current political problemsfail to point the way to solutions for the reasonexpounded in the previous two chapters: They are static,3D pictures of situations.When tasked to be more elaborate, they expand againwithin the rigidity of a more detailed 3D picture. Theresult may be a proportionately clearer picture of thepresent state of affairs, but rarely a 4D exploration of pastdynamics leading to it, and almost never a 4D dynamicbeyond the present. Why should this be so?- 86 -1. Neglected DentistryIf an international political situation has grown to thesize of a current crisis, it obviously existed as a lesserdisturbance in the past, whether for a short period or alonger duration. Either way, like a sore tooth, it was notprevented by attentive brushing and flossing, nor solvedwith a relatively minor filling once it became a cavity.Only now, when the pain has become intolerable and thesole remaining recourse is extraction or a root canal, is itbeing confronted.Neither career diplomats nor intelligence agenciesfocus on “prevention”. Their time, attention, and budgetsare consumed by irons actually in the fire, nor do theywish to gain reputations as bearers-of-bad-news. So theyremain reactive rather than proactive.It is now well-known that both London andWashington had decoded the Japanese Pearl Harborattack orders, but deliberately withheld notification of themilitary commanders in Hawaii so that a “minor raid”could be sensationalized to dislodge American isolationistsentiment. For its part Tokyo envisioned Pearl Harbor assomething of a “bloody nose” to buy time and deterAmerican intrusion into the western Pacific.These naïve miscalculations went horribly wrong forboth the United States and Japan. Admiral Yamamoto’sbombers caught almost the entire Pacific Fleet at anchor,virtually annihilating it. To make matters worse, bungledJapanese embassy coordination in Washington delayeddelivery of formal war declaration until after the raid,shaming it irretrievably as an unconscionable sneak-attack.The catastrophic overconsequences stunned bothnations. Roosevelt and Churchill got America’s entry intothe European war, but at the terrible price of four years’horrific slaughter in the Pacific, culminating in the- 87 -nightmare of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As for theJapanese, they were appalled by their success. “I fear allwe have done,” said Yamamoto upon learning of thedevastation of the raid, “is to awaken a sleeping giant andfill him with a terrible resolve.”Through the lens of FF & MW, however, the realtragedy was failure of attention to the consequences ofAmerican commercial constraints on the Japaneseeconomy over a much more extended prelude. Japan’sperception was that this signaled an agenda of escalatinghostility, quite possibly presaging eventual navalconfrontation. MW monitoring and campaign initiationwould have recognized both countries’ perspectives andderivative motives, and neutralized them well in advanceof their explosion into PhysWar apocalypse.2. DoublethinkAlso characteristic of more than a few nascent crises isa history of observer/analyst controversy over whetherthe subjects were initially or recently serious problems atall.Government functionaries and bureaucrats, mindfulof their careers, are understandably anxious not to gainreputations as incompetents or even “bearers of badnews”; too often the fire alarm is blamed for the fire.It is always thought safer to reassure senior officialsthat their existing policies are wise and adequate. If andwhen they collapse, the usual recource is to foist theblame on “unforeseen factors” which no one couldanticipate.Even when an issue takes center-stage, disagreementoften persists as to how significant it really is, whether it- 88 -is a good or bad development; or even alternately both atonce: Orwell’s “doublethink”. 27Is, for instance, the very existence of the United Statesof America historical legitimacy in which its citizenryhave every right to take pride? Or is it land stolen from itsoriginal inhabitants, the American Indians, who were notonly systematically dispossessed of their homeland butvery nearly exterminated in the process?If the latter, does the fact that this was an experienceof previous generations excuse its results today?Doublethink sympathizes with the Indians and weepsfor their tragedy - but simultaneously dismisses anynotion of returning their lands to them as inconceivable.3. ThoughtcrimeAlso as mentioned in Chapter #2, certain dilemmæwhose evident solutions touch or further fray “politicallyincorrect” nerves are both frequently and routinely dealtwith by refusing to confront them at all, or byrecontextualizing them into a admissible scenario.At this writing persons entering the United Stateswithout government permission are styled either “illegalaliens” or “undocumented immigrants” depending uponthe speaker’s point of view. Persons denying women’sright to control the functions of their own bodies stylethemselves “pro-life”, while to the threatened womenthey are “anti-choice”.And of course nations as a whole prescribe certainterms while proscribing others. Whether you are a27 In the “negative utopia” of 1984, words could have not only avariety of meanings, but even simultaneously inconsistent andcontradictory ones, depending upon the motives and needs of aconversation. This convention goes beyond hypocrisy or duplicity tovoluntary, automatic elasticity in the underlying thought itself.- 89 -“freedom fighter” or a “terrorist” is a decision reserved toyour friendly neighborhood Thought Police. 28At the end of World War II the Allies felt sympatheticto [and tacitly guilty for their previous ignoring of]European Jews’ suffering during the War, so the UnitedNations decided to give them a new, sovereign nation oftheir own.Despite the fact that it was in Europe that the Jewshad suffered, there was no question of any Europeannation, even the vanquished Germany and Italy [or theUnited States or Soviet Union], giving up any of their ownterritory for this magnanimous purpose.Instead it was decided to give the Jews a completely-uninvolved third-party’s land: that of Palestine.The Palestinians themselves were not consulted inthis decision. They were simply dispossessed by force -killed if necessary, and continue being progressively so tothis day. Yet the justice of the original theft is not to bequestioned: flouting of this taboo is agreed by theestablished international community to be thoughtcrime.4. TenacityIn a PhysWar analysis a crisis-potential problem suchas that of Israel/Palestine is normally represented as a“current [3D] snapshot”, with no attention orconsideration paid to the 4D dynamic that engenderedand aggravated it previously.Correspondingly PhysWar-genre politicians areaccustomed to looking for an equally-3D “solution of the28 In 1984 the most feared institution of domestic vigilance andsurveillance is the Thought Police, which as its name implies is notconcerned with overt acts, but rather with individuals’ perceptionsand opinions inconsistent with Party prescription and expectation.“Thoughtcrime is the crime that contains all others in itself.”- 90 -moment” rather than a forward-evolving 4D dynamic asin a MW campaign.An example of this is the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis,wherein the United States suddenly discovered the SovietUnion to be moving nuclear-warhead intermediate-rangeballistic missiles (IRBMs) into Cuba, capable of reachingalmost the entire U.S.A. within 5-10 minutes.This obviously, and drastically, reduced the UnitedStates’ retaliatory response time from the previous ICBMwindow of 30 minutes, and was thus deemedunacceptable by the Kennedy Administration.An immediate quarantine was announced, to befollowed by an American air strike on and invasion ofCuba. The Soviet Union refused to remove the missiles,and a nuclear World War III appeared imminent.At the last minute 4D review noted the previouspresence of American Jupiter IRBMs in Turkey. Insteadof the assumed mutual 30-minute launch warning, theU.S.S.R. had been living with, but evidently notcomfortably, a 5-minute American launch warning. Intheir view comparable Soviet IRBMs in Cuba simplyrestored rather than destabilized deterrence balance.The crisis was accordingly ended when both nationsagreed to remove their IRBMs, restoring a mutual 30-minute window. 29The absence of a continuing 4D dynamic in the crisis’aftermath created a post-3D-solution vacuum ofinattention, with dire consequences - once again quitesusceptible to FF anticipation and neutralization. Whenword of the secret Jupiter deal eventually got out,29 Or so it was represented. In actuality both the U.S. and theU.S.S.R. had fleets of submarines armed with nuclear missilescapable of positioning themselves for launch much closer to thetarget(s) than either Turkey or Cuba. But being PhysWar-unsolvable,this even greater danger was tacitly ignored. In MW it would nothave been, and would also have been neutralized.- 91 -President Kennedy was excoriated as being “soft oncommunism” - an albatross around his neck thatcontributed to his later assassination. 305. Reflection ElusivenessThese examples above serve to illustrate how difficultit is in actuality to pursue Machiavelli’s prescription oftruly, honestly, fairly reflective analysis in a 3D-entrainedenvironment.Pressing issues of international tension and disputeare thus not necessarily difficult to solve in the abstract,but are often paralyzed by peripherals of bias, prejudice,grudges, and other agendæ - some of which being tabooto openly acknowledge. 31If the past is forbidden, the present cannot becompletely and correctly understood. The result is that awould-be problem-solver is constrained both bydoublethink and thoughtcrime which he cannot see orcannot even mention if he does.This is the dilemma and tragedy of the existing,PhysWar environment - and it is the actual explanationwhy ostensible attempts at diplomacy, negotiation, andcooperation inexorably and inevitably disintegrate into30 Prouty, L. Fletcher, JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot toAssassinate John F. Kennedy. New York: Carol Publishing Group,1996.31 The United Nations expropriation of Palestine notwithstanding,Israel maintains that its true right to Palestine comes directly fromits god, YHVH, through Moses and as established by King David. Ininconvenient actuality there is no archæological evidence whateverthat Moses ever existed, that there was an Egyptian “exodus”, or thatJudaic kings named David and Solomon actually existed. Nor is thereany evidence of Solomon’s legendary Temple; the popular “wailingwall” was never part of any Jewish temple. Cf. Ernest L. Martin, TheTemples that Jerusalem Forgot. Academy for Scriptural Knowledge,1994.- 92 -PW. Which itself, as shown in MindWar, solves nothing,but only perpetuates and deepens the Earth’s wounds.B. 4D FearAs mentioned above, conventional national andinternational political analyses are usually strictly 3D,painting a picture of the present situation while stoppingshort of projecting its future. At most the implications ofthe continuation of certain current conditions may beidentified, but not to the extent of concrete predictions.Historical factors contributing to the present picturemay be cited, but such recitation is not true 4D since it ismerely a “construction detail” of the 3D portrait.4D analysis - projection of the future with or withoutspecified adjustments - is rarely if ever ventured, theassumption being that it is too easy for such specificity tobe wrong: The past and present are known summariesbased on accepted, endorsed facts, but far too manyvariables are thought to exist to make the futurepredictable or controllable.The consequence of 3D analysis is that decision-makers similarly default into 3D responses, which areintended to have a desired impact only on the presentsituation, changing it towards a more desirable 3D“snapshot”. The entire process is one of consecutive static“presents”, not a 4D dynamic continuum.1. Political NonscienceAnd also again: The validity of an OU science isestablished by reliable repetition under laboratoryconditions. This is an easy threshold in the physicalsciences, wherein the elements of a given experiment aregenerally easy to identify, isolate, separate, and combine.- 93 -It’s a different matter in the so-called “social sciences”because of the multitude of factors and the elusiveness ofanything resembling a “closed laboratory”.As recounted in one of the companion books in thisseries MindStar: Within the course of Western Europeancivilization, governmental concepts went from ancienttheocracies antedating the Hellenistic era to anassortment of theologically-endorsed monarchies (the“Age of Absolutism”), to experiments with variousmixtures of human-based “social contracts” following theReformation/CounterReformation/Enlightenmentconflagration marking the onset of the modern era.Along with these metamorphoses the study of humaninteraction evolved from ancient religion to Classicalphilosophy to exhausted rejection of both abstractmetaphysical principles and dull post-Enlightenmentmaterialism.Political Theory/Philosophy dutifully restyled itselfPolitical Science as it sought to dissect the institutionsof sociopolitics and reduce humanity to functionalexpressions of them. Hence the academic dominance ofInstitutionalism aka Structural-Functionalism.This tidy descriptive methodology underwent a crisisof inadequacy in the late -19th/early-20th centuries whenthe sterility of mundane utilitarianism was challenged byspontaneous revivals of Romanticism, which reachedtheir ecstatic apotheosis in the authoritarian orgies ofItalian Fascism and German National Socialism.In the first decade following the “disintoxication” ofWorld War II - intellectual as well as territorial -[surviving] Political Scientists strove to reestablishInstitutionalism as the dominant paradigm. Yet itremained suspect for its former failure, and a more- 94 -Postmodern32 fashion, Behavioralism, was advanced tocontest it.Throughout the 1960s-70s the Institutionalists andthe Behavioralists jousted collegially with one another,occasionally leaving bewildered students [such as theauthor] wondering whether any actual attention wasbeing paid to politics per se. The wave, it seemed, wasmore important than the water.2. However ...Until the 1970s Political Science had remained safelywithin the 3D of present institutions and/or behavior,with respective appeals to historical precedents to shoreup current claims of legitimacy.Respectable Political Scientists were tacitly inagreement that theirs was not an actual science, henceproposals, much less attempts to extend the disciplineinto 4D “futurism” were greeted with an enthusiasmwhich could only be described as scant.In 1974 SUNY/Buffalo Professor Albert Somit violatedthe sanctuary with his blasphemous anthology PoliticalScience and the Study of the Future, which, despite aparade of formidable futurists from multidisciplines andan exhaustive bibliography quite adequate to pedestal32 Postmodernism is typically defined by an attitude of skepticism,irony, or distrust toward grand narratives, ideologies, and varioustenets of Enlightenment rationality, including notions of humannature, progress, objective reality & morality, absolute truth, andreason. ( Encyclopædia Brittanica) I am inclined to hypothesize theLovecraftian offspring resulting from an abominable tryst ofExistentialism and Dadaism.- 95 -them altogether, came and went without dislodgingeither/both of the sacred cows. 33Indeed in his Introduction Dr. Somit seemed hesitantto come right out and define what he called “PoliticalFuturism”, preferring to shadow-box around varioussubsets such as societal and environmental trends.Ultimately he fell back on confessing his fear of thesubject he was purportedly advancing, and defended itonly as a response to that fear:There are some skeptics, candor requires me to observe,who would regard [political futurism] as plausible but notpersuasive. They believe futurism is a fad which is no moresubject to rational explanation than any other fad. No doubtthere is some element of truth in this view: Social scientists,and perhaps other academics, are prone to faddism, and itwould be naïve to argue that this tendency has been totallyinoperative.But the objection really misses the point. Even iffuturism is largely a fad, the question remains: Why this fadrather than another? Furthermore even fads may yieldconstructive results. It would be unfortunate if those whohold to the faddist explanation permit it to prejudice theirassessment of futurism’s potential for enlarging our capacityto understand, and perhaps even to direct the course ofhuman events. 34In point of fact the “futurism” subculture of the 1970swas a fad, along with its fellows such as space-colonization and still-lingering Hippie communal retreats[along with their paranoid counterpart, apocalypticsurvivalist enclaves] still right here on Earth. Such33 Somit, Albert, Political Science and the Study of the Future.Hinsdale, Illinois: The Dryden Press, 1974. While Dr. Somit bothpreviously and postviously authored many impressive texts andanthologies exploring various aspects and implications of PoliticalScience, this remarkable heresy seems to have vanished from evenused-copy availability. Pity.34 Ibid., page #4.- 96 -positive and negative fantasies, heralded by prophetssuch as Gerard K. O’Neill of the space-colonial L5Society 35 and the irrepressible Timothy Leary, who feltthat to properly go high one should be high: L5psychedelicized to SMI2LE:36He’ll fly his astral plane,Takes you trips around the bay,Brings you back the same day,Timothy Leary.He’ll take you up, he’ll bring you down,He’ll plant your feet back on the ground.He’ll fly so high, he’ll swoop so low.Timothy Leary. 37The 1970s’ exciting aspirations gradually evaporatedin the face of disintoxicating realism: NASA’s post-Apollobudget dried up, reducing extraterrestrialism to therelatively-workhorse space shuttle, which was limited toutilitarian military and meteorological tasks; initial35 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L5_Society36 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary37 The Moody Blues, “Legacy of a Mind”, 1968.- 97 -expectations of civilian use, even passenger-tourism,faded slowly, numbly away. 383. ToolsThe methods employed by conventional futurists[including rogue Political Scientists] are as follows:a. Trend ExtrapolationThe most commonly- and effortlessly-used, TE simplyselects relevant current trends [in economics, populationgrowth, and similar measurables] and projects themahead as many years as desired, either lineally orlogarithmically as seems appropriate.The more trends are added to a given projection,presumably the more reliable it will be. Or, if the trendsare badly chosen, the less reliable the entire picture.TE has two principal vulnerabilities:• Presently-unknown discoveries, inventions,or other outside factors may skew or even38 In 1976 Paul Kantner and I brainstormed some initial plans for“Project Andromeda”, which would have contracted the orbitalshuttle to broadcast select Jefferson Starship music worldwide aswell as on Andromeda Galaxy M-31 calculated vectors absent thedistortions and limitations of Earth’s atmosphere.The equipment would have required relatively little space andenergy aboard the shuttle(s).Project Andromeda went as far as initial correspondence withNASA, but was aborted when civilian shuttle use was preempted.Project Andromeda was inspired by Kantner’s dreams of not justhiring, but hijacking the United States’ first starship, in his 1970Hugo Award-nominated album Blows Against the Empire:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blows_Against_the_EmpireIn the 21st-century “Internet age”, of course, worldwide music iscommonplace. The interstellar cartographics were resurrected foruse in my 1977+ Star Wars novel FireForce:http://www.amazon.com/dp/1533264392- 98 -obsolesce a present trend, as in carssuperseding horses as transportation.•• A chosen trend may be inaccuratelyweighted against others, or against non-trend developments such as the outbreak ofa PhysWar.b. Flow-TreeAlternately called a “flow-chart” or “decision-tree”,this is not so much a forecast as a systematic narrowingor elimination of possibilities.The present is represented as a problem, and possibledecisions or actions addressing it are drawn from it. Eachsuch solution brings with it new situations and possiblenew problems, all of which are consecutively charted.The idea is that the flaws in impracticalities will bequickly apparent and cause that flow-option to dead-end.The more realistic options continue, either dead-endingfurther along or surviving the extent of the chartedsequence.This, then, is a way of taking the vague and making itexplicit, along with consequences. It also has theadvantage of being useful for both individuals andgroups, as anyone looking at the diagram can offermodifications to it.c. Cross-MatrixThis is another “narrowing” technique, and indeedcab be used together with a flow-tree in this function.All of a problem’s components are listed along boththe top and one side of a matrix [for example money,population, weather, disease, food, etc.]. Under eachfactor are listed possible changes to it per decisions which- 99 -could be taken, such as a 50% increase or decrease of thefood supply]. Next the intersection boxes on the matrixare filled in as accurately as possible. For instance a 50%reduction in the food supply intersected with the currentpopulation health or disease statistic can be estimated toincrease it by an appropriate calculation.The filled-in intersection boxes can then be valued orcolor-coded as to proportionate influence. The result is alarge, filled-in matrix with a mixture of, say, red/yellow/green intersections. This systematizes the decision-maker’s options - ideally as simply of choosing a course ofaction generating the most green and the least red boxes.Both flow-tree and cross-matrix devices are sosensible and methodical that one would suppose allimportant decisions to utilize one or both of them.Unfortunately most decisions don’t, being instead theproduct of vague, unweighted emotions and impulses.d. ScenariosThe use of scenarios is an exercise in reverse-engineering and is thus very close to FF, falling short of itmostly in its sloppiness.The decision-maker conjures up a picture of thesituation as he would like to see it without its presentproblem(s).In the case of the Israel/Palestine antipathy, thismight be a one- or two-state solution with both groupscoexisting peacefully.Next the decision-maker juxtaposes this ideal to thepresent and attempts to come up with courses of action tobridge the two.While such scenarios are often visualized as ideals, itis rarely the case that the necessary paths to them areworked out, for which, indeed, flow-tree and cross-matrixcharting would be useful.- 100 -e. Models/Games/SimulationsAnother “fad” in certain circles of late-20th-centuryacademia was for an instructor to gather a group ofstudents together, present them with a real-worldproblem, assign each one a role significant to it (chief ofstate, military commander, financier, ambassador, etc.),and challenge them to address the situation.This could be interesting, stimulating and fun, but itrarely translated into an actual policy consensus whichcould be effectively communicated to the modelers’ real-world counterparts.In the present day its ghost persists in the form ofelaborate computer-games and simulations, usually foronly one or two players, enabling them to fight/avoidWorld War III from the convenience and safety of akeyboard.f. ExpertsThe simplest of all 3D forecasting approaches is justto summon a person, office, or agency assumed to be anexpert on the topic at hand, then allow that expert toidentify, narrow, and propose the solution.While on its face this sounds sensible, its vulnerabilityis that few experts are truly disinterested: each has amotive of some sort: economic advantage, powerhegemony, ideological bias, affection/grudge.At the onset of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis theKennedys, inexperienced in dealing with the SovietUnion, summoned Dean Acheson to the White House toadvise them. Acheson had decades of diplomaticexperience, but with the much more primitive andparanoid Soviet Union of Stalin’s day. Had his advicebeen followed now, the crisis would have been lockedimmediately into inflexible, threatening extremes and the- 101 -inexorable consequence of war. Fortunately Acheson’srigidity was recognized as anachronistic and rejected.Another common failing of expertise is that,consciously or otherwise, the decision-maker seeks outexperts who will reinforce what is already his bias. He islooking not for objectivity but reassurance and a moreelaborate and impressive argument for the desired action.Nay-sayers aren’t invited, or if present will be tuned-out or tokenized “devil’s advocates” - as happened toUnder Secretary of State George Ball when he opposedLyndon Johnson’s escalation of the Vietnam War.g. CyclesOstensibly the most obscure, least understood, andleast used 3D tool, cycles might perhaps be more aptlydiscussed in Chapter #2. These are major or minorchanges in background circumstances which recur overidentifiable periods of time, sometimes identically butmostly with evolutionary modifications.A good example of such a mechanism is theKondratieff Cycle:In 1925 Soviet economist Nikolai Kondratieffpublished his observation that in contemporaryindustrialized countries the common, internationaleconomy surged and subsided in 40-60 year cycles(generally referred to as “Kondratieff Waves”).Since then these cycles have proved reliable enough tocontinue their use in some economic schools, along withlater-formulated “short waves” subsidiary to the “long”KWs. 3939 #PR-76-10009, An Analysis of the Cyclical Dynamics ofIndustrialized Countries. Langley, Virginia: Central IntelligenceAgency, January 1976.- 102 -C. ResourcesI use not only all the brains I have, but also all I canborrow.- Woodrow WilsonEven in conventional, 3D forecasting, the task ofidentifying, collecting, and correlating all of the materialdata, often on a worldwide scale, is daunting.Fortunately, the more so in the “Internet Age”, numerousinstant-access and either free or inexpensive resourcesexist to facilitate this chore.Listed here are some of the most practical ones I havefound and utilized with impressive objectivity, substance,and reliability.Most forecasting services today are understandably inthe genre of economics and marketing, as they exist forcommercial purposes.The ones I have identified here don’t ignoreeconomics, but are more principally focused onsociopolitical forecasting.1. World Future SocietyFrom its website:The World Future Society is the world’s premiercommunity of future-minded citizens. A 501(c)(3)organization founded in 1966, the organization is driven bythree critical objectives:(1) Uniting people passionate about building theirdesired futures through an ecosystem of members, chaptersand partners.(2) Advocating to bring to public awareness the world'smajor challenges. We ignite the futurist mindset in thosewho no longer want to be bystanders.(3) Building global labs where futurists of all types areable to produce solutions, that are not solely reactive to thepresent, but to architect new systems that make the brokenones obsolete.- 103 -Our membership is made up of futurists of all types;entrepreneurs, executives, forecasters, economists,scientists, students, parents, and conscious citizens. We areunited by our shared desire to tackle the world’s biggestchallenges. 40As perhaps not surprising given its 1960s’ inception,WFS is less a directed-research resource than it is aninitiation into the hobby & habit of “futurism”:contemplating and pursuing one’s life with “the future”accented. It’s a bit like visiting Disneyland and spendingthe day in Tomorrowland.WFS publications don’t emphasize alerts and alarms,bur rather on general environments in a “world citizenlifestyle” context. While not deliberately ignoring orconcealing unpleasant information, its tone is clearlypositive, constructive, and optimistic.For its first several years WFS had two levels ofindividual affiliation: “regular” and “academic”. The latterwas indeed for professionals interested in detailed,directed research. During my graduate studies I found itinvaluable, and in those pre-Internet days of the 1970s,both versatile and responsive.Today there are more-expensive WFS individualmemberships, but they appear to principally providemore preferential amenities at WFS events.2. StratforStratfor is the most efficient targetable forecastingresource I’ve found on the Internet as of 2017 publishingtime. It provides a mix of both free and subscriptionservices. From its website:40 http://www.wfs.org- 104 -What We DoAs a geopolitical analysis firm, Stratfor provides valuablecontext to global events that empowers businesses,governments, and individuals to confidently navigate anincreasingly complex international environment. Founded20 years ago around the principle that transformative worldevents are not random, but are in fact predictable, Stratforhas grown into one of the world's most respected providersof strategic analysis and forecasting.How We Do ItBy leveraging a deep understanding of history, politicsand geography along with our unique methodology, Stratfordelivers informed perspectives on today's events anddevelops a more accurate assessment of the future.Dedicated teams of researchers, analysts and writers distillmassive amounts of open-source information each day andexamine it through the lens of geopolitics to developcomprehensive, independent, unbiased and nonpartisananalyses. Stratfor analysis cuts through the noise to offervaluable understanding and actionable insights to help ourreaders succeed.Why We Do ItGlobally engaged individuals, Fortune 500 companies,universities and organizations across an array of industriesturn to Stratfor for objective geopolitical analysis andforecasting that reveals the underlying significance andfuture implications of emerging world events.Our MethodologyStratfor's proprietary methodology is our framework topredict the shifts in geopolitical power that shape our worldand interpret the significance of today's global events. Itcombines an understanding of geopolitics, detailed analysisand rigorous internal debate, which is then refined into aunified Stratfor perspective. Our analysts begin with a floodof open-source information, filter out the noise, unearthemerging paradigms, challenge assumptions and reconcile- 105 -conflicting truths to produce actionable analysis andforecasts. 413. Hudson InstituteOne of the older and more venerable forecastingenterprises is the Hudson Institute - very much likeStratfor in its scope and sophistication, but more of anacademic institution on its own terms - internally-prioritized and generated publications and analysesrather than external user-driven. Still its sophisticationand reputation remain impeccable.I’d recommend Hudson as a more in-depth backup toStratfor, assuming that it happens to have made detailedstudies of your topic of special interest,Founded in 1961 by strategist Herman Kahn, HudsonInstitute challenges conventional thinking and helps managestrategic transitions to the future through interdisciplinarystudies in defense, international relations, economics, healthcare, technology, culture, and law.Hudson seeks to guide public policy makers and globalleaders in government and business through a vigorousprogram of publications, conferences, policy briefings, andrecommendations. 424. United States GovernmentThe advantage of U.S. Government resources is thatthey are USGr: packed with information, obtained andcontinuously updated through worldwide bureaucracies,and blessed with essentially-unlimited budgets. Theirwebsites abound with this information, usually free forthe viewing & downloading.41 https://www.stratfor.com42 http://www.hudson.org- 106 -The disadvantage of USGr is also that they are USGr,with their information compiled and published to be insupport of Government/current Administration policies,interpretations, and objectives. This shouldn’t be taken tomean that the analysts in question are biased or myopic -just that they understand and approach their primaryresponsibility as supporting U.S. policy rather thanobjectively critiquing it.For specialized forecasting in related subjects such asfinance and military, it’s useful to consult the websites ofthe most directly-relevant Executive Departments, as inthese examples Commerce and Defense.For more general information, particularly with apolitical focus, the two most useful are the Department ofState and the Central Intelligence Agency.a. Department of StateThe Department of State website has an extensivelibrary of sociopolitical resources, cross-related byvarious geographic areas, specific nations, non-nationalethnic and religious groups, and other classifications. 43These are identified and accessed by drop-down menus ofthe website, which efficiently narrow the user’s search.b. Central Intelligence AgencyContrary to its popular image as a behind-the-Green-Door tree-fort, the Central Intelligence Agency bothpublishes and makes websearch-available vast quantitiesof information [at the Unclassified level]. Per its website:The CIA releases millions of pages of documents eachyear and frequently releases items of public interest on thiswebsite. The Library contains a wealth of information, from43 https://www.state.gov- 107 -unclassified current publications to basic references, reportsand maps.The World Factbook provides information on thehistory, people, government, economy, geography,communications, transportation, military, and transnationalissues for 267 world entities. Our Reference tab includes:maps of the major world regions, as well as Flags of theWorld, a Physical Map of the World, a Political Map of theWorld, a World Oceans map, and a Standard Time Zones ofthe World map. 44It should be added that both DOS and CIA alsoattempt to be responsive to public requests forspecialized information, and not just within Freedom ofInformation Act (FOIA) formalities. Simply send them aletter with your question of interest, and you may besurprised by the materials it elicits. 4544 https://www.cia.gov/library45 Sometimes this occurs with James Bond melodramatics. Someyears ago I wrote to the CIA asking for any information they mighthave on Kondratieff Cycles. About a month later I received a copy ofan extensive CIA report, with the envelope’s return-address that of agentleman in Arlington, VA. When I wrote to thank him, my letterwas returned as “undeliverable”. As I later discovered, both theperson and the address were fictitious CIA blinds.- 108 -[index-109_1.jpg]- 109 -Chapter 4: Phases, Layers, & DimensionsThe Three Laws of MindWar1. MindWar is the conduct of war without injury ordeath to human beings, and without thedisruption or destruction of their means oflivelihood.2. While MindWar includes access to the humanmind, this is done only to stimulate its capacityfor and interest in cooperative problem-solving.3. PhysWar is the consequence of MindWar failure.Therefore MindWar must not be allowed to fail. 46A. MindWar InterlocksAs introduced in MindWar and expanded herein, aMW campaign addressed to a given problem situation iscompletely alien to conventional PhysWar reactiveflailing. PW invariably fails, and fails with substantialdestruction, affliction, and loss-of-life, because it isinherently a desperate, last-resort reaction to similarly-haphazard diplomacy: ultimately a series of ad hocbandages applied, too little/too late, to a widening social46 Aquino, Michael A., MindWar. San Francisco: Barony of Rachane,2016, page #38.- 110 -wound. In the idiom of FF, it is a succession ofdisconnected 3D artifices.The same national or international environmentunder MW vigilance ideally never permits a wound todevelop in the first place. MW resources’ intelligenceanticipates potential disequilibrium and adjusts it back tostability before the ordinary humans involved are evenaware of any potential disruption.Thus the majority of MW solutions in effect applysolutions preempting their associated problems.B. MW Resources1. The MindWar TriForceAs detailed in MindWar Part II, the United States’MW capability is concentrated in three United StatesArmy MW Branches, evolved from the old SpecialOperations Forces: MetaForce/MFB (supersedingSpecial Forces/SF), MindWar/MWB (supersedingPsychological Operations/PO), and ParaPolitics/PPB(superseding Civil Affairs/CA).Despite transparent efforts to cosmeticize them, allthree of the obsolete Branches functioned de facto as“battlefield janitors”, tasked with cleaning up the messleft by PW combat Branches’ death and destruction.These three renewed Branches are designed tofunction both independently and in concert with oneanother, throughout the [up to] four Phases of a MWcampaign.2. The PhysWar BranchesImportantly and crucially, the MW Special OperationsTriForce is the primary and exclusive deployment- 111 -presence of the United States in a failed-diplomacy crisissituation.The PW Branches remain in stand-down, as a“contingency threat” only. In this role they may beparaded, brandished in displays and “war games”, andotherwise showcased as may lend additional enthusiasmfor and cooperation with the MW campaign, but anyactual use of their destructive capabilities is absolutelyprohibited.In this role the PW weaponry becomes treated, andregarded, with exactly the same foreboding as nuclearcapabilities since Hiroshima and Nagasaki: They aretaken utterly seriously, but their actual use is neverconsidered an actual option.In a pre-campaign environment (“Phase Ø”),geographically-assigned MFB teams remain alert forimbalances. If such occurs and cannot be rebalancedthrough the actions of one or more MFB teams, themental-conditioning technologies of MWB are introducedto condition the affected humans towards greaterreceptivity to the MFB efforts. While in a Phase Ø mode,these processes are completely invisible: not so muchclandestine as quietly unnoticed. MF teams areconstituted to blend in seamlessly with local races andcultures, while the MWB Psychological Controls(PSYCONs) are predominantly activated from remotedistances to target the subconscious functions of thehuman brain. 47As its designation connotes, Phase Ø is, like anordinary PW environment, one of 3D stasis. There is noneed for 4D dynamics until/unless destabilizationreaches a severity and inertia requiring the declaration ofa MW campaign (Phases 1-4).47 The 14 principal PSYCONs are detailed in MindWar Chapter #3.- 112 -C. MW DeclarationIf MW Phase Ø monitoring fails to preserveequilibrium, and a policy decision is taken to activelyresolve the disequilibrium, then a MW campaign isformally commenced and Phase 1 initiated.As prescribed in MindWar, a MW campaign beginswith the formality of a “Declaration of MW”. 481. PW-Era Status Quoa. PW DeclarationsIn conventional PhysWars (PW) such Declarations,when antagonists even bother with them, have beenemotional, angry accusations of grievances along with thestated intent to respond to them by PW violence. Thesupposed goal of such PW is not part of the Declaration.Indeed throughout recorded history the dismayingfact is that PWs have never known where they would begoing once declared; such bothersome details wereimpatiently brushed aside in the passion of thecommencement, for others to grapple with later,assuming anyone survived with the acumen andresources necessary to do so.Perhaps the sole, and underappreciated exception tothis was the practice of Imperial Rome to announce itscampaigns to a decided enemy, and even moreimportantly to convey the inevitability of Roman victoryin the undertaking. As Livy observed:The terror of the Roman name will be such that theworld shall know that, once a Roman army has laid siege to acity, nothing will move it - not the rigors or winter nor theweariness of months and years - that it knows no end but48 Ibid., page #184.- 113 -victory and is ready, if a swift and sudden stroke will notserve, to preserve until that victory is achieved. 49The effect of this perception obviously went farbeyond the battle or war of the moment; it was a majordeterrent to provocations of the Empire, contributing tothe famous - and never-repeated - Pax Romana. The XthLegion’s 375’ earthen ramp, constructed in 73 C.E. to the“unassailable” Judæan fortress of Masada, remains tothis day a mute, stark testimony to this implacabledetermination. 50b. PW NonDeclarationsSince aggressive PW was pro forma outlawed uponthe post-World War II founding of the United Nations, itis no longer “politically correct” to baldly aggress. Henceaggressor nations, including as so-inclined the UnitedStates, couch PW Declarations as defensive responses tounprovoked belligerence. 51 If a suitably-outrageous49 Keller, Werner, The Etruscans. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1974,page 262.50 Glorified Hollywood revisionism notwithstanding, the Sicari rebelswho seized Masada in 70 C.E. first massacred its Roman garrison,then wreaked havoc in the countryside, including slaughtering 700women and children in the nearby village of Ein Gedi. In 73 theRoman Governor Lucius Flavius Silva personally led the Xth Legionto put a stop to the terror. When Silva breached Masada, he foundthat the Sicari had killed themselves and any who refused suicide:960 men, women, and children in all. Only two women and fivechildren were found alive. Cf. “Masada”, Wikipedia for multiplesources.51 All Members shall refrain in their international relations from thethreat or use of force against the territorial integrity or politicalindependence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent withthe Purposes of the United Nations. - United Nations Charter,Article 2, ¶4.- 114 -incident is not ready-to-hand, an appropriate false-flagoperation is duly executed and bewailed.c. False-FlagFalse-flags are covert attacks staged so as to appearconducted by a nation or group other than oneself. Theyare used to attack one’s own territory & people, or others’for whom one wishes to falsify actual responsibility.As George Orwell indifferently observed in 1984,domestic populations emotionally reject believing thattheir own governments would kill some or even many ofthem merely to excuse attacking a foreign target. Such isappallingly not just routine, but unremarkably so. 522. MW-Era Status Posta. “Enemy” DefinitionThe MW contrast to this shameless, shameful PWdanse macabre could not be more diametrically itsrepudiation.Most essentially and immediately, humans are notharmed nor their property destroyed, because they arenever defined as “the enemy”. 53Rather the enemy is the problem situation itself,against which all involved humans are in alliance toovercome.52 “The Horror ... the Horror ...” - Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (MarlonBrando), U.S. Army Special Forces, in Francis Ford Coppola’sApocalypse Now (1979).53 This includes the armed forces of other interventionists, regardlesswhich government or faction they may be supporting. A MWcampaign blankets all humans, including one’s own forces, with thesame MW PSYCONs. It is thereby that the desired cooperativeatmosphere is created among all participants.- 115 -b. TransparencyMW is thus a completely cooperative effort, and assuch is prosecuted equally-completely in the open:Neither its intelligence, planning, or execution isconcealed or Classified.When MindWar first appeared in 2013, this brazentransparency elicited instinctive consternation amongstrategists indoctrinated and seasoned in operationalsecrecy. MW seemed glaringly, indeed blasphemouslycounterintuitive. Upon reflection the logic overcame theknee-jerk: Consideration of the entire range of humanperspective concerning a given problem is required for anequally-comprehensive solution: composition rather thanimposition.c. Phase 1 DiagnosticsThe principal activity of Phase 1 is, thus cooperatively,to thoroughly identify and diagnose the “disease”, not itssymptoms.Here too the difference from PW is dramatic, sincePW invariably focuses on the expressions andconsequences such as civil disturbances and armedrevolts, and directs its energies towards suppressingthem.MW, on the other hand, focuses on such eruptions’underlying causes, through a sequential, layeredapplication of diagnostics, culminating in the campaign-activating Foundation Diagnosis (FD).d. Foundation DiagnosisThe final and most comprehensive in a progressiveseries of situation diagnostics in Phase 1 of a MindWarcampaign.- 116 -The FD is so-named in tribute to Dr. Isaac Asimov’s“psychohistory” 54 Foundation novels, the FD takes initialform in a 3D research & analysis process, but then, andcrucially, becomes 4D dynamic as it is progressivelymodified throughout the subsequent three Phases of theMW campaign.Unsurprisingly it is the completed 3D Phase 1 FDwhich is formalized and published as the Declarationof MW. It defines the problem situation in its totality,focusing upon its underlying causes. It identifies thecombined national, factional, and/or individual humaninterest and participation in a campaign to overcome it.Finally it [preliminarily] outlines the standardsaccording to which the campaign’s success will bemeasured in-progress and finally achieved upon MWvictory.Further unlike the haphazard blindness of PWDeclarations, a MW Declaration is conceived andconstructive to be inevitable and irresistible. It is a courseof action which not only takes all variables into account,but establishes their pre-control and constant adjustmentduring the campaign, never allowing their inertia toexceed that of the campaign.Thus the Third Law of MW - that it cannot beallowed to fail - is not mere hyperbole: It is absolutely,uncompromisingly in earnest.54 Psychohistory: That branch of mathematics which deals with thereactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economicstimuli. Implicit in this definition is the assumption that the humanconglomerate being dealt with is sufficiently large for valid statisticaltreatment. A further necessary assumption is that the humanconglomerate be itself unaware of psychohistorical analysis in orderthat its reactions be truly random. - Isaac Asimov, Foundation, 1951- 117 -D. Dual-Direction1. Obverse: ÁristosIn Phase 2 of a MW campaign, the 3D Phase 1 FD/Declaration initially constructed by the MetaForce (MF)research & analysis assets, with later augmentation bycorresponding teams and PSYCONs from the MindWarBranch (MWB) begins its translation into the campaign’sdynamic, 4D continuum.The 4D directional goal MFB & MWB develop is thenecessary consequence and culmination of the campaign:the áristos - the “best possible practical solution”.Referring back to Chapter #1, this is Machiavelli’scombination of virtu and occasione, resulting in ordini. Itwould be quite possible to limit the MW campaign to thisimplicit practicality, and indeed in certain caseslimitations caused by external factors such as time,logistics, MW resources, or the intrusion/complication ofother problems may dictate this conservatism.2. Reverse: KalokagathiaIdeally, however, a MW campaign addresses itsoutcome 4D bidirectionally. Complementing the forward-projecting áristos is a reverse-projected ideal outcome,corresponding to Machievelli’s vision of civitas. This isthe “best imaginable” outcome, comprising a “clean sheetof paper” or “from the ground up” redesign of the targetnational, community, geographic area, or otherdemarcation of the MW campaign scope. ThusMachiavelli’s civitas corresponds to Plato’s ideal ofkalokagathia. 5555 Cf. Chapter #1.B.- 118 -3. ParaPolitics BranchConception and construction of this ideal, however, isnot utopian daydreaming: It requires a methodicalapproach, and a correspondingly-expert authority toexercise it.This operation is the responsibility of the thirdcomponent of the MW Special Operations TriForce:ParaPolitics Branch (PPB).As developed in MindWar Chapter #5, PPB is theevolutionary successor to the PW-era Civil AffairsBranch, a “battlefield janitor” element relegated tocleaning up the carnage, destruction, and life-supportdevastation left in the wake of PW combat operations.In a MW campaign, of course, such a catastrophicdisintegration is never allowed to occur. The preemptiveand adjusting activities of MFB & MWB stabilize thesituation before it has a chance to devolve to that state.However the purpose of a MW campaign is not just tosecure such stability, nor even to perpetuate it peráristos; it is to perfect it - or, more precisely, to establisha self-perfecting polis.4. AgathonPPB’s point of planning departure (which happensalso to be its point of ultimate future arrival) is not agovernmental, political, or social structure per se, but- 119 -rather an all-encompassing centerpiece of morality: inPlatonic terminology the Agathon. 56To illustrate and elaborate:The most stable, civilized, and pleasant societies ofantiquity - such as Egypt, Crete, and Hellenic Greece - sharea surprisingly simple, yet subsequently forgotten principle:that of a polis defined, united, and energized by acommon moral principle.In Egypt this was the cosmic principle or neter (god/goddess) of Maat, usually simplified as “justice” but moreprecisely extending to virtue, fairness, and rectitude in allpersonal and community affairs. There was no concept ofindividual rights against the government, becausegovernment was viewed as a system ordered by the neteru.Similarly each Egyptian, whether high- or low-born,participated in this system. Crime and corruption were ofcourse possible, but inadvisable because of the convictionthat vice would be punished severely after Earthly death.Virtue in Mesopotamia was understood as obedience tothe willful desires of the god(s), not harmony with theirnatural principles. The “wrath of the gods” was feared by thestate in Mesopotamia, as it was never in Egypt (which wasruled by a god-king). The Mesopotamian king sought the“right ruling” of his community, in accordance with theAkkadian principle of Shulmu (later adopted by the Hebrewsas Shalom): a term meaning not just “peace” but thecommunity well-being that engenders peace.Hellenic Greece includes the civilizations of Crete (b.2700 BCE), Greece (Mycenæ b. 1600 BCE, Athens b. 600BCE), the Ægean islands, and Magna Græcia (Sicily andsouthern Italy). The Hellenic Greek cultures are mostnotable for exalting the intellect - for making the universe an56 In classical political thought there was a concern to locateauthority beyond anything that anyone could appropriate, either inwisdom or in justice, or, as in the Platonic Agathon - the supremeGood which is beyond definition. The Agathon can accommodate asmany formulations as there are human beings, and every person canmake his own report. As there will always be a transcending orconceivable Good beyond the good(s) of particular individuals, theAgathon is ineffable and indefinable, and necessarily transcends thespatial and temporal limits of finite powers of perception. - Iyer,Raghavan N., ParaPolitics: Toward the City of Man. New York:Oxford University Press, 1979, page #22.- 120 -intelligible tool and/or puzzle for mankind to explore,understand, and use. They did not conceive mankind ashaving a “mission” from the gods, though the gods couldinfluence human fortunes for good or ill. To the extent thatthe Greeks put humanity at the “center” of importance, theyworshipped its body (as in athletics and the Olympic Games)and its mind (as in the sophistic and philosophical schools ofAthens).The Cretan (Minoan) political system, a bureaucraticmonarchy most significant for its peacefulness, included noevident slavery, standing military, or marked classdistinctions. Women appear to have been politically equalwith men. The Minoan culture was destroyed ca. 1400 BCEby an invasion from Mycenæ. The Mycenæan culture, whichfaded into the Greek “dark ages” within another threecenturies, denied women equality and did have slavery.The “dark ages” lasted from 1100 to 800 BCE and cameto an end with the founding of the first Greek city-states. Thefirst Greek writing appears in about the 8th century BCE,with the first dated writing in 600 BCE.The later Hellenic era (600-300 BCE) - based as it wason empirical investigation and inductive reasoning - was achallenge to the older, tribal way of doing things. Previouslycustom ( nomos) was the rule for behavior, and to followcustom was dike, the path of justice. Disregard of customwas hybris and was unacceptable and even dangerousbeyond its immediate implications.As it became increasingly evident that social problems,such as the reform of Athenian laws by Draco and thenSolon, could be solved by either an appeal to either relativepracticality or absolute standards, a growing controversyarose concerning the relation of nomos to physis (nature orthe divine order). Foremost of the absolutists wasPythagoras, who sought in number the beginning or arche ofthings - the ordering principle or “one behind the many”. 57Even a cursory glance around the contemporaryWestern international community reveals that nowhere issuch a transcendent, metaphysical Agathon to be found.57 MindWar, op. cit. , pages #157-9.- 121 -True, the post-Enlightenment58 West pretends generallyto Christian morality, but in actuality this is merely aceremonial veneer: services, blessings, invocations, andplatitudes which have absolutely no force in implementedpublic affairs. Every now and then the Roman Catholicpope makes an appeal for some moral sanctimony, whichis popularly acclaimed and then immediately ignored.E. PW-Era Status QuoToday there are only two principal metaethicalsystems influencing actual national operation: Judaismin the state of Israel and Islam in the several nationssubordinating themselves to various interpretations ofthis theology.This accordingly makes both Israel and the Islamicworld “irrational” in Western eyes, hence mysteriouslythreatening.The United States resolves this in the case of Israel byaccepting and obeying it unquestioningly, an in the caseof Islam by ignoring it [among useful allies, such as SaudiArabia] or PW-attacking it [elsewhere].Correspondingly both Israel and Islam regard the defacto-atheistic West generally, and the United Statesespecially, as “godless” and decadent.A curious “third theocracy” existed for most of the20th Century in the form of ideological communism, ormore precisely the “denominations” of Marxism,Marxism-Leninism, and Maoism. Each of these avowed a“god” prior to and preemptive of ethical relativism: most58 As specifically discussed here, the European “Enlightenment” (late17th-18th Centuries) was an intellectual revolt against the church-proclaimed metaethics of Christianity in favor of purely-utilitarianreason: ethical relativism. However such judgments were stillreserved to sovereigns; thus murder is acceptable, even admirable ifprescribed by a state, but proscribed & punishable in the individual.- 122 -generally the economic class stratification and warfare ofMarx & Engels. This “god”, which could only be obeyed,not ignored or dethroned, is technically called dialecticmaterialism in contrast to the dialectic idealism ofGeorg Hegel, which posited a similar, albeit deistic “god-dictated” social evolution in the “lives” of nation-states. 59At this 2017 writing god-communism is no more:discarded by Russia and its former European satellites ca.1989 and corrupted into a cynical state-capitalism inremnant-alcoves such as China and Vietnam.F. MW-Era Status PostThis, then, is the tableau which PPB confronts whenconsidering the achievable necessity for the Agathon in[para]political perfectionism:1. Theistic StatesIn the case of Israel and Islamic nations/groups, asupreme superstitions exist but are nowhere near thepurity and nobility of a true Agathon.Before PPB can undertake to actualize kalokagathiain these cases, it will be necessary to annihilate andreplace the existing monstrosity with a pure Agathon inthe same imagery. This task is assigned to MWB, whose59 The inevitable, ominous apotheosis of dialectic idealism was theRomantic deification of the state as realized in Italian Fascism andGerman National Socialism. This completely submerged andabsorbed individual human life into the “living state”, which therebyasserted an absolute right to strengthen and perpetuate itself: whichaspiration constituted its entire “morality”. In the non-communistWest the human alienation this inspired led to the post-World War IIrejection of Hegelian metaphysics generally, and the ascent of suchanti-ideologies as European Existentialism and the American BeatGeneration.- 123 -PSYCONs can be used to accomplish this substitutionwithout the conscious awareness of affected humans.2. Atheistic StatesIn the case of the materialist West, the task ofgenerating an Agathon again falls to MWB, but this timeits orientation and azimuth are significantly different:The dormant, disdained “spirit of mankind” - Plato’srecognition in the Republic that humanity “unchainedfrom the darkness of the cave” will aspire to the light ofAgathon. Once again this is not to be attempted at theconscious, rational level of targeted humans, butsubconsciously through MWB’s PSYCONs. The pleasantresult will be a new perception of and insistence upon theAgathon at all socioeconomic levels, eclipsing the cold,dead numbness of the PW-era cultural climate.3. External HarmonizationIt is of course a relatively incidental but nonethelessessential matter to coordinate such MWB projects so thatthe Agathon as created in all of the above environmentsnot only fulfills the needs and controls the superstitionsor substitute-superstitions of the directly-affected humangroups, but also integrates smoothly and constructivelyinto the external international community. Thatcommunity will most likely not understand the localizedmechanism or the reasons for it, nor be susceptible to thePSYCONs employed.G. Agathon: Key to KalokagathiaThe importance of this step in PPB’s kalokagathiaproject cannot be overemphasized. Indeed once theAgathon is established and in force, the remaining- 124 -Phases of the MW campaign rather fall easily into placeas though “magnetized”. Once the MWarrior understandsand applies the above principles and preparations, therewill be neither surprise nor mystery to this “waterfall”.H. Pyramid of the AgathonIndeed we’re not ready to leave the Agathon just yet.As is doubtless clear from the above discussion, it’s anessential principle. Everything depends upon it, whichmeans that it must be correctly perceived andapprehended.This further necessitates explaining it coherently andmeaningfully to humans who will both apply it at higherlevels of polis responsibility and be affected by it at lowerlevels.1. PW-Era Status QuoConsider the ostensibly-simplistic example of theJudæo-Christian God as utilized in a non-MWenvironment:At the highest, control level of the variousinstitutional churches and synagogues, God is identifiedand represented as an abstraction beyond humancomprehension. As such it is not personified, nor is anyeffort made to communicate with it. It is simply, andonly, posited to exist.From this insistence religious policy-makers decide inwhat ways it can be useful to them, and speak, write, and/or act on its behalf accordingly. If Aquinas’ Divine Lawrevelation is claimed, this is the level at which it will beasserted as a policy lynchpin, as for instance CatholicPapal “infallibility”.Lower-tier clerics and executives are not permitted tochallenge these representations, on the grounds that they- 125 -are not sufficiently intelligent, educated, or sophisticatedto understand, much less critique them. Or simply thatthey are not sufficiently purified to receive Divine Lawrevelations.Also at progressively-lower levels, God is transformedfrom an abstraction to a personification: an old man witha white beard, a burning bush, a pillar of fire, or whateverelse serves control purposes. Family (Mary, Jesus, et al.),a support staff (angels), and mischief-makers (Satan &dæmons) are added where they may be encouragingly orcoercively useful.Over the centuries a complete and versatile mythologyencompassing all of these is assembled, appropriatedfrom other religions, and modified to remain relevant andeffective as a control device among progressive humancultures and generations. The overall result ranges froman ever-more-abstract metaphysical ideology at the top toan easy-to-understand comic book at the bottom. Withinthis collective everyone gets what he needs, and whatkeeps him docile and obedient.2. MW-Era Status PostWith the MW Agathon it’s another matter entirely.Instead of being a whimsical fantasy of conveniencewhich is pushed downward for purposes of control andexploitation, approaching the Agathon begins at the mostelementary levels of human consciousness, thence isprogressively refined to ever-more-exacting elaborations,until a final, perfect apprehension is attained.3. The Pyramid6060 Iyer, Raghavan, ParaPolitics. New York: Oxford University Press,1979, page #48.[index-126_1.jpg]- 126 -- 127 -If the reader is unused to his thoughts being dissectedwith such terrifying exactitude, it is not surprising giventhe habitual eikasia of conventional, PW-conditionedhumanity. With correlation to the “Thought Architecture”analysis in MindWar, however, this bewildering diagrambecomes quite straightforward and intelligible. 61a. Thought ArchitectureAs detailed in MindWar and retouched upon inChapter #2 of this book, human thought overall consistsof consciousness and subconsciousness, of whichthe latter is by far the more active (95%) and influential.In individual human experience, however, these arenot perceived as hard-and-fast separations; they blendinto one other without notice or concern. [Indeed theyare frequently difficult to distinguish outside of alaboratory environment.]b. Below the BaseWhen initially considering the Pyramid, note thatbelow it is “homeostasis”, which is the state of mind atrest. [When this methodology is applied to a politicalsituation or object (such as a nation, culture, or group), itis the existing state of affairs.]Absent application of the Pyramid, conventional, PW-level individuals or institutions know and undertakenothing more than attempting to balance an arbitrarystandard of “good” (usually a superficial ideology) with“beauty” (behavior at least somewhat responsive to it).This is the balance, such as it is, that can be seen in allPW-environment diplomacies, and which is supposedly,if rarely actually, the PW-goal when the diplomacy fails.61 MindWar, op. cit. , pages #81-5.- 128 -c. Conscious AscentNow in the capacity of a PPB MWarrior rise to thePyramid of Agathon.The left-side ascending-line is labeled “Dialectic ofReason”. The term dialectic (ancient Greek διαλεκτική)refers to the establishment of a philosophical truth by themeans of rigorous, cooperative discourse, whereby thereconciliation of two or more perspectives yields a moreaccurate one.Therefore the left-side ascending line shows anincreasing resolution of conscious thought from Eikasia(primitive impulse) to Pistis (ordinary active/reactivesensations & decisions) to Dianoia (precise, logical,reflection62), and finally [possibly, potentially] to Nœsis (intuition andapprehension [of the Agathon]).Note that this entire progression rests upon a“foundation” of will: that is, a deliberate effort at alllevels is required to actualize it.d. Subconscious AscentThe right-side ascending line addresses thesubconscious elements of the thought-experience.It rests upon a base of eros, which refers to a sentientbeing’s obsessive passion for the truth. [Ultimately thisstems from any such being’s bewilderment at its own“unexplained” existence and compulsion to discover thatexplanation.]This desire initially results in random, generalizedimages, identified here as eikone (“icons”), which, as theygrow stronger and more continuous, coalesce into zoa(objects).62 Cf. Chapter #1.- 129 -As these sensations increase in composition andclarity, they are further realized as built-up complexities( mathemata).Penultimately separate models form the basis for eide(archetypes), which serves to distinguish the permanentfrom the transitory: realization of the [Platonic] Forms,the [Egyptian] neteru.The entire right-side ascent dynamic is called the“Dialectic of Revolution” in that it is goal-, not process-driven [as contrasted to the conscious “Reason”].e. ConvergenceAs the pyramid-shape illustrates, with each increasein refinement, definition, and focus, the distance betweenthe conscious and the subconscious narrows; at the apexthey are completely unified into a single identity.f. TranscentThere is also a central ascending line - the “Dialecticof Transcendence” - which represents the intendedpurpose of the entire thought: the apprehension of its“governing” Agathon.[For the time being the several “crossbars” of “Politicsof -” may be set aside, as they are better-clarified below.]Admission to the Dialectic of Transcendence is notcasual or trivial; as shown at its point of entry, it requiresthe key of logos.The ancient Greeks saw the Objective Universe (OU)divided into a non-conscious, automatic functioning( physis) conceived and implemented by a divineintelligence and consciousness ( logos).The individual human intelligence ( nous) was capableof coherent recognition and application of the logos; each- 130 -human was thus a microcosm of the macrocosmic logos.As Raghavan Iyer relates:In classical Greece the term nomos had to do withmeasure. As early as Sophocles, agraphos nomos, theunwritten law, had divine sanction, and with the laterStoics it was grounded in nature ( physis) as theimmanent logos.Nous for Anaxagoras was both a cosmologicalprinciple as the source of all motion, and an immanentprinciple in all living beings.Diogenes qualified the principle, which hedenominated ær-nous, by replacing mechanisticinterpretations with the view that its activity isintelligent and forms the best possible kosmos, and it isexpressed in the operation of a principle of measureamong all things.In the later writings of Plato kosmos nœtos, theintelligible universe, is both produced and ordered bynous, which is inherent in all men.Plotinus drew the implication that nous istranscendent as the cause of kosmos nœtos and isimmanent in human beings, each of whom is thereforea kosmos nœtos.The Stoics concluded that the human nous is amanifestation of cosmic nous.Nous represents a binding-together of humanminds as rays from one central source of cosmicintelligence. 63Thus as shown the logos enables the humanintelligent consciousness ( nous) to transcend the OU( physis) by entering into that Dialectic leading toapprehension of the Agathon.63 ParaPolitics, op. cit. , pages #54-55.- 131 -g. ApprehensionSignificantly [and perhaps annoyingly!] the entirePyramid is not capstoned by the desired Agathon.Instead that Grail glows like a star above the apex. Why?Because while all three dialectics are progressiverefinements in their respective realms, an authenticAgathon is not in any sense a built-up composite. It is aneter-/Form-manifestation, hence is metaphysical.What is accomplished by “ascending the Pyramid” isthe clearing-away of all impediments to beholding theAgathon; it is an authentically divine ecstasy. Indeed fora true Agathon it could not be otherwise.If this all sounds a bit outré as a mission-statementfor a U.S. Army Branch, it must be remembered what aformidable mission PPB has: to ascertain, articulate, andimplement the subject polis’ supreme guiding morality-principle (= Agathon).Moreover if it fails in this, the MW campaign must belimited to only the continuum of a dynamic, constantly-adjusting áristos. It will not enjoy the permanent andtranscendent stability that kalokagathia instils.I. Kalokagathia ParaPoliticsApprehension of an Agathon as identified to be idealfor the supercontrol of a given political situation, whilethe necessary first step, is obviously not going toconclusively solve the problem.For that PPB needs to first reconceptualize, thenmethodically promulgate a new polis based upon thatAgathon.- 132 -1. PW-Era Status QuoThe conventional sequel to PW invasion, destruction,and occupation of a problem situation is styled “nation-building”, frequently preceded by the methodical,complete obliteration of the defeated governmentalstructure.The imposed replacement puppet government isassembled from local collaborationists and/or obedient,opportunistic exiles, and given a hastily-thrown-togetheradministration structure modeled on Western notions ofrepresentative social-contract governments, habitually inthe American or British model.The title “president”, with “prime minister” a closesecond, has become ubiquitous to the point of slapstick insuch charades.A veneer of legitimacy is sometimes added by thestaging of “popular elections” wherein, under the ever-present fear of the occupier’s or puppet’s guns, themasses are herded to cast ballots for one or two pre-approved candidates. Such elections are routinely rigged,and in the rare instance of an upstart result, the victor isdiscarded by re-election, coup, or deportation.It hardly needs observing that this is no way toremedy post-PW devastation. Probably the mostcompelling example is the rise of Nazi Germany ineventual response to the national punishment,exploitation, and hypocrisy inflicted by the VersaillesTreaty. Since then the catalogue of repeat-performanceshas been unending, leading to the contemporaryinternational community’s omnipresent instability.Recent examples include the 2013 military removal ofthe post-revolutionary elected Egyptian PresidentMohammed Morsi (sentenced to death in 2015 foremphasis) and the 2014 [unconstitutional] parliamentarydismissal of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanuyovch for- 133 -favoring economic ties closer to Russia than theEuropean Union.With no viable PW-era reform on the horizon, the 21stCentury has seen a worldwide surge in populationinstability characterized by disinterest in governmentparticipation, material/economic rather than ideologicalindividual motivations, and increasing migration toanywhere that promises greater such opportunities andadvantages.“Patriotism” is increasingly disdained by politicaldissidents as anachronistic propaganda for the PW-enslavement of the stupid and naïve.2. MW-Era Status PostIt would be too much to expect for MW tomiraculously reform a planet gripped in PW-convulsion.What can be commenced are incremental cures.Directly and immediately these benefit the afflicted localhumans; possibly they also serve as example for others toemulate in whole or part, even absent the impetus of acollapse in the existing structure.Following on from the above discussion of theAgathon, it should be immediately obvious that PPB’sapproach to polis-initiation has absolutely nothing incommon with PW heavy-handedness.From the beginning PPB teams meld with the localpopulace at all social, economic, ethnic, and culturallevels. It is PPB’s initial function to expose this collectiveto the previously-apprehended Agathon, in graduatedmetaphors enabling all to understand and recognize it attheir level of intelligence, education, and life-discretion.At this stage, which generally corresponds to MWcampaign Phase 2, MWB is a constant, omnipresent,invisible presence through application of a tailoredPSYCON mix blanketing the entire geographic area.- 134 -The result of this is not some kind of sinister“brainwashing” after the fashion of PW-era “re-education” torture, but simply a general stimulation ofindividual energy, cognitive awareness, and amicablecooperation.As detailed in MindWar, the MWB PSYCONs operatepredominantly at the subconscious level; in effect theyserve to jump-start the “right side” of the AgathonPyramid - which, with its 95% Thought Architecturepresence, practically enables the Pyramid’s rational “leftside” to harmonize near-effortlessly.Once again such a rosy picture is not hyperbolicfantasy. It is based upon the very real, very scientific, andvery demonstrable MW principles introduced andsubstantiated herein and in MindWar; and whereveractualized will quickly be validated by results. All that isrequired is the vision and the will to do it.And remember that MW is not a “zero-sum game”; ifit is not attempted, the PW alternative will continue to fillthe vacuum.3. ParaPolitics ComponentsDesigning and implementing the Agathon-inspiredpolis requires the identification and tailoring of severalpolitical factors and functions, collectively entitled“ParaPolitics” by Dr. Raghavan Iyer, who extensively anexhaustively described them in his 1979 book of that title.Once again these are most easily seen and correlatedin diagram:6464 ParaPolitics, op. cit. , page #26. The hexagram is employed simplyto interrelate the named concepts, and does not connote anyconnection with the Hebraic “star of David”.[index-135_1.jpg]- 135 -- 136 -a. 2D>3D>>4DFindFar is of course a printed book limited to two-dimensional image representations. While in the not-distant future it will doubtless be commonplace for booksto conveniently generate 3D holographics when readersturn to those pages, FindFar must still tax yourimagination for such expansion here.So this diagram is not really a triangle within ahexagram within a circle. It is a pyramid within ahexagon within a sphere. 65The hexagon is omnirotational about the pyramid(which, while 3D, rests stably upon its base as previouslydescribed).The external sphere is similarly omnireferential fromthe perspectives of the pyramid and hexagon.Think, therefore, of a three-layered mobile sculpture.Actually this 3D sculpture is further in 4D motion asdiscussed in Chapter #2, but one headache at a time.b. Agathon Pyramid: The CoreAt the center of the diagram is the Agathon Pyramid,resting on its conscious (will) and subconscious ( eros)bases. Together they energize the logos, activating theParaPolitics manifestations of Platonic vision ( nœsis) andMachiavellian virtu, revealing the governing Agathon,whose neter/Form then radiates outward throughout allof the diagram’s constituent elements.65 Topologists will be quick to point out that a hexagon has manymore than six internal extensions. Touché. The point to be taken withthis analogy is that the various labelings of the 2D hexagram linesare all equally accessible to/influential upon the entire ParaPoliticaldynamic; they are not “hierarchical” or sequential.- 137 -c. Types of PoliticsParaPolitics embraces six specialized types orexpressions of political thinking, expression, and action,increasing in complexity and nuance as they appearhigher on the Pyramid of Agathon.At the base of the Pyramid is the quasi-instinctivePolitics of Self-Preservation. Here are found allmeasures sought and taken by a sentient being to protectand continue its existence: the “culture of the caveman”,which is “political” only because of the realization of“safety in numbers”.Next higher - that is to say present and emphasized inpolitical entities - are Power and Stability: thecharacteristics of a tribe, city-state, or nation-state. LikeSelf-Preservation, these qualities are generally consideredto be essential, not optional.Neither is inherently altruistic or admirable: Power isexercised by projecting the values of the polis beyond itspopulace and borders through means ranging frompropaganda to armed force. Stability of the polis is soughtby reinforcing education and indoctrination of thecitizenry, and if necessary more drastically by repressionand punishment.Next come what amount to options and luxuries:Reason and Welfare. It is at this level of civilizationthat, with basic needs of survival ensured, cultures canengage is some flexibility, seeking more satisfaction invarious social structures, customs, and conveniences.A standard of living above that of mere survival alsopermits luxuries for some or all persons, as well as ameasure of provision for those unable to completely takecare of themselves.These categories of politics more-or-less completewhat the world regards as the “modern state”. It is- 138 -similarly among these variables that PW cooperation andconfrontation occur.Along the ascent of consciousness, as depicted on thePyramid, they involve only the lesser-intellectualinvocations of Eikasia and Pistis.Approaching the apex are the still-rational Politics ofPerfectibility, characterized by Dianoia, and finally thePolitics of Transcendence, enabled through Nœsis.These last two are not employed in PW interactions, butare both essential in MW.As the hexagram/gon implies, all of these types ofpolitics [except Transcendence] can be mixed andweighted in the design of an ideal polis.In a MW campaign prudently or necessarily limited toan áristos resolution, only combinations of the functionsof Power, Stability, Reason, and Welfare are developed,with especial consideration given to moderating the firsttwo.Perfectibility becomes an option in a completekalokagathia design, insofar as it reflects an intentionalapplication of the identified Agathon.d. Internal Stresses & External PressuresThe surrounding circle/sphere illustrates externalitiesconstantly seeking to repress and constrain the polis, orto stimulate its propensity and tendency to advertise,export, and expand itself.Such forces and influences can range from theideological (the seeking of reassurance and validationfrom alliances and partners) to debate, tension, orconflict with those who deny such consolation.The optimal polis will aspire to anticipate and manageall such uncertainties with flexibility, tolerance, andempathy.- 139 -e. 4D DynamicPW-era “regime changes” or “nation building” ishabitually a 3D “makeover”. Once such changes havebeen forced into place, their continuation is assumed tobe the responsibility of the new governmental structureto sustain itself; if not, PW is reapplied as endlessly as theforeign power deems necessary to its interests andpriorities.MW strategists are not permitted this cavaliersloppiness. Whatever they devise, whether at the levels ofáristos or kalokagathia, must be engineered foroperation in a 4D dynamic environment, both internallyand externally.What this means is that the FF projections arecontinued throughout the polis-configuration process,providing the initial design with the flexibility andresources it will need to continue to survive and prosper,harmoniously and rewardingly with its neighbors andpartners abroad.- 140 -[index-141_1.jpg]- 141 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5: COMPLICATIONS[The bankrupt Duchy of Grand Fenwick66 [index_split_006.html#p141] declaredwar on the United States in order to lose and bereconstructed.

When and whereactivated, it can expect to arrive in a PW messapproaching meltdown.

National andregional crises are often rushing towards a mega-crisis,such as an explosion into a much more widespread PW.So MW must not only stabilize the situation, but do sounder the pressure of a ticking clock.What are some of the possible impediments, and howcould MW reduce or eliminate them?B. PW Profitability1. ExtentAs unpalatable as it may be to contemplate, PW staysin business because it is business - enormously,extremely profitably so. Indeed it is not hard to argue that“war profiteering” is the primary reason for thepromulgation and continuation of PWs worldwide,especially by nations (such as the United States, Israel,Russia, China, and much if industrialized Europe) withsubstantial munitions industries. Just how much doesthis canary actually weigh?U.S. weapons exporters lead the world in profits fromthe booming military arms and equipment business, drivenby rising tensions and conflict around the world, accordingto a new report from London-based analysts.The annual study by IHS Inc. - which looks at militarymarkets in 65 nations, excluding small arms, munitions, andsurveillance programs - finds that the United States isbehind one-third of all equipment and weapons exportsworldwide.This is no small amount: In 2014 global “defense” tradesurpassed $64.4 billion, the report finds.“Defense trade rose by a landmark 13.4 percent over thepast year,” said Ben Moores, senior defense analyst at IHSAerospace, Defense and Security, in a press statement. “This- 143 -record figure has been driven by unparalleled demand fromthe emerging economies for military aircraft and anescalation of regional tensions in the Middle East and AsiaPacific.”The U.S. further is the top profiteer from rising conflictacross the Middle East, accounting for $8.4 billion in exportsto this region in 2014, compared to $6 billion the previousyear ... 67The United States is by no means the sole addict tothis particular economic opiate. The IHS reportcontinues:The second tier of exporters to the Middle East is led bythe United Kingdom with US$1.9 billion, the RussianFederation with US$1.5 billion, France with US$1.3 billionand Germany with US$1 billion. 68MW, by contrast, utilizes no PW weaponry at all,either directly used by the United States PW militaryforces and their covert civilian adjuncts (CentralIntelligence Agency, private paramilitary contractors) orindirectly by sales or gifts to PW allies and surrogates.2. RedirectionConventional proposals to eliminate war-profiteerismgenerally default to either socialist nationalization of suchindustries, eliminating private/corporate/shareholderenrichment, or surrender and subordination of national67 Lazare, Sarah, “U.S. Weapons Exporters Lead World in WarProfiteering”, Common Dreams, March 9, 2015.http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/03/09/us-weapons-exporters-lead-world-war-profiteering68 “Saudi Arabia replaces India as largest defence market for US”,IHS Jane’s 360, March 9, 2015.http://www.janes.com/article/49809/saudi-arabia-replaces-india-as-largest-defence-market-for-us- 144 -PW capabilities to a supranational body such as theUnited Nations. Both options are prima facie unrealistic.The MW solution, which may be considered anadmittedly cynical, yet nonetheless effective applicationof áristos, proposes to allow the manufacture, sale, andexport of munitions to continue, but to discourage itsactual use in favor of mere display and spectacle.The model for this is the 1947-1991 Cold War betweenthe United States and the Soviet Union. Possession ofnuclear arsenals and intercontinental delivery systemsmore than sufficient to annihilate one another in an[inevitably simultaneous] launch made [hot] PWimpossible; the quaint if darkly-apt euphemism was“MAD” (Mutually-Assured Destruction), alternately the“balance of terror”. 69Instead of the Cold War’s eliminating the ostensibly-unusable conventional weapons industries of bothsuperpowers, these paradoxically expanded and alsoincreased production.Both countries’ populations were constantly alarmedby allegations of “missile gaps” [at the time of theKennedy/Nixon Presidential campaign] or claimeddeficiencies in conventional arms so extreme as topossibly embolden the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pactallies to venture a conventional PW against the UnitedStates and NATO, gambling that the conventionally-outmatched West would ultimately not dare the suicidalstep of resorting to nuclear weapons, even “battlefield”.This scenario began to gain serious Westerncredibility during the Carter Administration (1977-80)and was seized upon by the successor ReaganAdministration (1981-8) as the centerpiece of its “EvilEmpire” propaganda.69 In the old sense of just being really, really scared - not the 21st-Century “Communism!”-replacement monster-under-the-bed of“Terrorism!”.- 145 -The result was a surge in U.S./NATO conventionalarmament and deployment which the already-strainedSoviet Union found itself economically unable to match,even with maximum extractions from its Warsaw Pactsatellites. Hence the collapse of the Eastern economy andWestern Cold War “victory” at the end of that decade.An interesting “sideshow” of this sinister circus wasthe United States’ invention of the “neutron bomb” in1977. More precisely titled the “Enhanced RadiationWarhead” (ERW), this was a nuclear weapon whichemitted a life- but not property-destroying burst ofneutron radiation. The idea was that, fitted to battlefield-level missiles such as the Corporal and Sergeant, it couldstop a Warsaw Pact armored offensive [literally] “dead inits tracks” without contaminating any territory ordestroying any structures.Suddenly it appeared that the “nuclear threshold”could be crossed tactically without triggering an“ordinary” thermonuclear holocaust.The East was obviously not pleased at this prospect,and argued furiously against it both diplomatically andpublicly.President Carter finally decided that the ERW wouldbe produced and deployed only if at least two otherNATO member-nations would agree to host suchmissiles. West Germany agreed if a second could befound. Turkey secretly became that second, but Carterchose not to publicize this and ERW faded away as a ColdWar crisis. 70Meanwhile the brandishing of weaponry was atestosteronic regularity, from May Day parades inMoscow to ceaseless “war games” in Western Europe. Atsea both blocs showed off their latest nuclear submarines70 The complete story of this curious episode may be studied in theauthor’s book The Neutron Bomb. San Francisco: Barony ofRachane, 2016.- 146 -and hi-tech surface ships, while ever-more-advancedaircraft and military-satellite launches culminated inextraordinarily-expensive missile-defense concepts [suchas the United States’ “Safeguard”] and President Reagan’sLucasFilm-inspired “Star Wars” satellite-warfaretechnology.Not to stray from the point here, many of theseexoticities were never deployed or even built beyond theexperimental stage, but as far as they went, they costtaxpayers substantial amounts of money, which lined thepockets of military, naval, and ærospace contractors.The intercontinental ballistic missile standoff betweenthe United States and post-USSR Russian Federationremains as formidable as ever during the Cold War,opening the door to a “Cold War II” with renewedmunitions-profiteer windfalls.This is hardly an ideal áristos, since the original perilof an accidental ICBM-triggering remains. That said, thisperil has never disappeared, even after the end of ColdWar I.The present orgy of sales and use of conventionalarms throughout the Middle East could be curtailed infavor of Cold War II braggadocio: the continued flow ofmoney without the flow of blood.If there is a downside to this caustically bottom-feeding áristos, it is that with full strategic attention onceagain fixated on a renewed “balance of terror”, there istheoretically that much more chance of a fatally “nervousmistake”, such as the 1962 “Cuban Missile Crisis” cameperilously close to being.Cold War II, if inaugurated, must take care to indulgeflamboyant posturing and pretentiousness - but nowherenear the push-button.- 147 -C. Politics of Stability1. “War is Peace”In addition to a PW- habitué nation’s financial-profiteering motives, an ongoing PW serves to increasepublic docility and obedience by emotionally uniting themasses against a proclaimed foreign enemy threat.Beyond this it inspires voluntary work and sacrifice as anexpression and passionate release of “patriotism”. In1984 George Orwell glacially but definitively summarizedthis rationale thus:War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessarydestruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologicallyacceptable way. In principle it would be quite simple to wastethe surplus labour of the world by building temples andpyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or evenby producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire tothem. But this would provide only the economic and not theemotional basis for a hierarchical society. What is concernedhere is not the morale of masses, whose attitude isunimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, butthe morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Partymember is expected to be competent, industrious, and evenintelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary thathe should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whoseprevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastictriumph. In other words it is necessary that he should havethe mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matterwhether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisivevictory is possible, it does not matter whether the war isgoing well or badly. All that is needed is that a state of warshould exist. 71In the Pyramid of Agathon and ParaPoliticsschematics, this appears as the “Politics of Stability”, theinward-coercive counterforce to the outward-aggressive71 “War is Peace”, 1984, op. cit., 1949, page #158.- 148 -“Politics of Power”. Together they serve as the state’sultimate binding mechanism.In Oliver Stone’s reflection upon the assassination ofPresident John Kennedy, a retired “Black Ops” officerobserves indifferently to the New Orleans DistrictAttorney:The organizing principle of any society, Mr. Garrison, isfor war. The authority of the state over its people resides inits war powers.Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War in his second term.He wanted to call off the Moon race and cooperate withthe Soviets.He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.But all that ended on the 22nd of November, 1963. 722. RehabAs with PW-profiteering, PW-passion is so deeplyintegrated into and characteristic of the contemporarynation-state that it cannot be directly removed.Indeed any obvious effort to do so would beinterpreted by the state as a dangerous threat tantamount72 The unidentified officer “X” in Stone’s JFK was in fact Colonel L.Fletcher Prouty (USAF-Ret.), a close friend of the author who hadserved as Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staffduring the Kennedy Administration. In a July 2, 1995 letter to theauthor, Prouty identified his immediate superior, Major GeneralEdward Lansdale, as the architect and executor of the assassination:“He had hundreds of trained and skilled men [from OperationMONGOOSE] whom he could use to flesh out the cover story that thetrue decision-makers had to have to protect the real hit team, andcreate the three decades of cover story that has embarrassedAmerican citizens since that date. Without such a cover story themurder and resultant coup d’etat could not have been achieved soeffectively. JFK would not give him that [South Vietnam]Ambassadorship for which he would have killed. What else could hedo?”- 149 -to treason, provoking a response similar to that visitedupon J.F.K.Instead MW must seek not to “cold turkey” nationalPW-addiction, but rather to shift it to a less-murderousfixation.Some smaller nations, fortunate not to be burdenedwith superpower-political self-images, indeed havesuccessfully crafted a raison d’état for themselves onsome other basis.Switzerland justifies itself as a bastion of internationalfinancial security, and also as sponsor of independenthumanitarian activities such as the Red Cross.Various Scandinavian countries have sought to behavens for other nations’ political refugees.Even some historic lands such as Egypt and Greece,despite too-close-for-comfort PW-surrounds, prefer tomarket themselves as tourist attractions.In the case of the PW-hooked superpowers, such acure is not as unrealistic or elusive as it might seem atfirst glance.The exemplar here happens to be China, perhapssurprisingly given its Cold War persona as a Maoistmonastery more doctrinaire than even its Stalinist modelacross the Great Wall. Today it shows little interest in anyPW-projection beyond what it regards as its millennia-old turf, preferring adventures in finance, technology,manufacturing [including for export], and cultural chic.The U.S. Obama Administration, casting about for ascarecrow to replace the by-now-motheaten “Terrorism!”,attempted to promote a sort of “neo-China-containment”Pacific Rim militarization, unfortunately regarded byboth China and America as comically-boring: Even a coldwar requires the other party to be interested, and China’sactual interest in the United States is more towardsinvestment and real estate ownership.- 150 -In annoyance Obama turned back to Russia, hopingthat the latter’s activities in the Crimea and Ukrainemight be an excuse for neo-NATOism. Once again Russiadoesn’t seem to be particularly interested, with VladimirPutin declining to don Darth Vader’s costume for alightsaber duel with either Luke Obama or Yoda Trump.So, since as of early 2017 both Eastasia and Eurasiaaren’t being PW-cooperative, the United States is reducedto still trying to pump more air into the disintegrating tireof “Terrorism!”.Certainly decades of Middle East economicstrangulation, bombing, invasion, and occupation havegenerated more than a few vengeful expatiates, butsomehow it just isn’t as nightmarifying as the old E-ticketride of imminent nuclear annihilation.So in the case of the United States, this melodramahas yet to play out - perhaps, if all monster-hunts fail,towards a merchandising alternative as salutary as ourown tourism. There is, after all, plenty to see and enjoythroughout all fifty states and the Beltway cage. We reallydon’t need to keep tying up Sweet Sue:Salty Sam was tryin’ to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack, he said“If you don’t give me the deed to your ranch, I’m gonna throw youon the railroad tracks!”And then he grabbed her (and then?)He tied her up (and then?)He threw her on the railroad tracks (and then?)A train started comin’ (and then, and THEN?)- And then along came Jones:Tall, thin Jones,Slow-walkin’ Jones,Slow-talkin’ Jones,Along came long, lean, lanky Jones. 7373 The Coasters, “Along Came Jones”, 1959.- 151 -D. Revolution1. A Party in ProgressWhen one nation decides to PW-insert itself into theaffairs of another, the general assumption is that therewill be a government presently in place to be subjugatedor replaced with fresh puppetry.However some situations of instability may notinvolve only actions between predefined national actors,but may extend to structural breakdown within one ormore of the object nations: factional infighting or morecomprehensive nationwide revolutionary efforts.On the ParaPolitics diagram this is recognized as thecentrifugal “Dialectic of Revolution”. It is massivelydestabilizing, often to the point of rendering any outsideintervention impotent, or at best of peripheral influence.One need only look back to the major such revolutions ofhistory - the American, French, English, and Russian tocite the most famous - and of course to innumerable lesswell-known examples.By their very nature, moreover, revolutions are non-standardized:- They may be more or less bloodless, or quite theother extreme.- They may be widespread mobilizations or close-heldcoups d’état.- They may or may not be ideology- or religion-based.- They may be over in hours or drag on for years.- They may be purely the instigation of the nationalpopulace, or the surrogates of foreign antagonists.And frequently various combinations of the above.PW intervention in such situations is typically unableto offer anything but an even more brutal combativepresence, the presumption being to suppress the existinginfighting by sheer weight of superior force. The- 152 -American Revolution saw attempted intervention by bothBritain and France, and the Russian Revolution by anumber of capitalist and monarchist nations unified intheir fear of the communist “germ”. At this writing Syriacontinues to be torn apart by internal factions, regionalmovements, and external national entities such as Russia,America, Iran, and Turkey.Even should a given revolution be successful, as in theexample of the creation of the Islamic State fromconquered portions of Syria and Iraq, there remains thequestion of internationally-recognized legitimacy.Again history provides many instances of relativelyquick recognition [as in the case of the United States] aswell as reluctant, grudging acceptance [as with the SovietUnion and the People’s Republic of China]. Sometimes itis only the appearance of a perceived greater threat, suchas Nazi Germany in the 1930s, that brings “strangebedfellows” at least temporarily together in formalrecognition presaging alliance: The once-perniciousStalin suddenly became affable “Uncle Joe”.2. Crashing the Partya. Status Quo AnteWhen faced with a revolutionary situation, MW’s firstrecourse is a detailed investigation into the causes whichgave rise to it - not the dramatics of the presentsymptoms.This is in effect 4D FF “in reverse”, going backthrough time in search of a previous stability if any.The logical consequence of this is to ascertain whetherit is in any way possible to “roll back” the present to theprevious - and if not, why not.- 153 -In such an analysis the overall present is also brokendown into as many parts as may be material andidentifiable.b. Retubing Toothpaste?Establishing a clear and accurate picture of the statusquo ante is one thing; returning a current destabilizationto it is quite another.What may seem to some - especially those mostfavored of it - as a “golden age” is rather unlikely to bethat for the revolutionaries. In all likelihood the irritantsthat inspired the revolution were already there, justsuppressed and not yet raised to the boiling-point.Hence MW is not so naïve as to attempt a return tothe past. What the FD establishes is an understanding ofthe revolutionary forces at work, not an áristos, muchless kalokagathia. One or the other of these prescriptionswill require FF and the Agathon/ParaPolitics exercisesdescribed in the preceding chapter.c. Conflicted DrivesOnce social forces have become strong enough tospark a revolution, the fixation of the revolutionaries isdirectly and immediately the catalyst of its success. Whilethere may be moral and ideological values at play, such asredistribution of land-ownership or the institution of apreferred theocracy, these remain to be argued-out oncethe old order is eliminated.A true revolution is not a statement of reform orreplacement of existing institutions or officialdom. It isan enraged statement of total annihilation of the existingorder, on the presumption that it is utterly beyond reformor redemption; nothing of it must survive.- 154 -It is thus that revolutions generate a kinetic passionwhich, while extent, is nigh unstoppable: a runaway train.MW has little alternative but to wait until this frenzyhas run its course, by either success or failure.The following example, fully half a century prior to theRussian Revolution, serves as a chilling illustration ofthese cataclysms:d. Dæmonic PossessionThe embrace of revolutionary fervor to the uttereclipse of every other emotion or value was seen andenunciated most incisively in the anarchistic-conspiracypreludes to the 1917 Russian Revolution, by an obsessedvisionary, Sergey Genadievich Nechayev. Unsurprisinglyhis was an unwelcome voice in Czarist Russia, and hedied in prison in 1882 at the young age of 35 - but notbefore he had penned his Revolutionary Catechism in1869. 74 This remarkable document bears careful attentionof all who would seek to either initiate or forestallpolitical revolutions:The Revolutionary CatechismDuties of the Revolutionary toward Himself1. The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no personalinterests, no business affairs, no emotions, noattachments, no property, and no name. Everything inhim is wholly absorbed in the single thought and thesingle passion for revolution.2. The revolutionary knows that in the very depths of hisbeing, not only in words but also in deeds, he has brokenall the bonds which tie him to the social order and thecivilized world with all its laws, moralities, and customs,74 Already a legend during his short lifetime, Nechayev was portrayedin Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s 1872 novel Dæmons (also known as ThePossessed).- 155 -and with all its generally accepted conventions. He istheir implacable enemy, and if he continues to live withthem it is only in order to destroy them more speedily.3. The revolutionary despises all doctrines and refuses toaccept the mundane sciences, leaving them for futuregenerations. He knows only one science: the science ofdestruction. For this reason, but only for this reason, hewill study mechanics, physics, chemistry, and perhapsmedicine. But all day and all night he studies the vitalscience of human beings, their characteristics andcircumstances, and all the phenomena of the presentsocial order. The object is perpetually the same: thesurest and quickest way of destroying the whole filthyorder.4. The revolutionary despises public opinion. He despisesand hates the existing social morality in all itsmanifestations. For him, morality is everything whichcontributes to the triumph of the revolution. Immoraland criminal is everything that stands in its way.5. The revolutionary is a dedicated man, merciless towardthe State and toward the educated classes; and he canexpect no mercy from them. Between him and themthere exists, declared or concealed, a relentless andirreconcilable war to the death. He must accustomhimself to torture.6. Tyrannical toward himself, he must be tyrannical towardothers. All the gentle and enervating sentiments ofkinship, love, friendship, gratitude, and even honor,must be suppressed in him and give place to the cold andsingle-minded passion for revolution. For him, thereexists only one pleasure, on consolation, one reward, onesatisfaction – the success of the revolution. Night andday he must have but one thought, one aim – mercilessdestruction. Striving cold-bloodedly and indefatigablytoward this end, he must be prepared to destroy himselfand to destroy with his own hands everything that standsin the path of the revolution.7. The nature of the true revolutionary excludes allsentimentality, romanticism, infatuation, and exaltation.All private hatred and revenge must also be excluded.Revolutionary passion, practiced at every moment of the- 156 -day until it becomes a habit, is to be employed with coldcalculation. At all times, and in all places, therevolutionary must obey not his personal impulses, butonly those which serve the cause of the revolution.Relations of the Revolutionary toward his Comrades8. The revolutionary can have no friendship or attachment,except for those who have proved by their actions thatthey, like him, are dedicated to revolution. The degree offriendship, devotion and obligation toward such acomrade is determined solely by the degree of hisusefulness to the cause of total revolutionarydestruction.9. It is superfluous to speak of solidarity amongrevolutionaries. The whole strength of revolutionarywork lies in this. Comrades who possess the samerevolutionary passion and understanding should, asmuch as possible, deliberate all important matterstogether and come to unanimous conclusions. When theplan is finally decided upon, then the revolutionary mustrely solely on himself. In carrying out acts of destruction,each one should act alone, never running to another foradvice and assistance, except when these are necessaryfor the furtherance of the plan.10. All revolutionaries should have under them second- orthird-degree revolutionaries – i.e., comrades who are notcompletely initiated. these should be regarded as part ofthe common revolutionary capital placed at his disposal.This capital should, of course, be spent as economicallyas possible in order to derive from it the greatest possibleprofit. The real revolutionary should regard himself ascapital consecrated to the triumph of the revolution;however, he may not personally and alone dispose ofthat capital without the unanimous consent of the fullyinitiated comrades.11. When a comrade is in danger and the question ariseswhether he should be saved or not saved, the decisionmust not be arrived at on the basis of sentiment, butsolely in the interests of the revolutionary cause.Therefore, it is necessary to weigh carefully theusefulness of the comrade against the expenditure of- 157 -revolutionary forces necessary to save him, and thedecision must be made accordingly.Relations of the Revolutionary toward Society12. The new member, having given proof of his loyalty notby words but by deeds, can be received into the societyonly by the unanimous agreement of all the members.13. The revolutionary enters the world of the State, of theprivileged classes, of the so-called civilization, and helives in this world only for the purpose of bringing aboutits speedy and total destruction. He is not arevolutionary if he has any sympathy for this world. Heshould not hesitate to destroy any position, any place, orany man in this world. He must hate everyone andeverything in it with an equal hatred. All the worse forhim if he has any relations with parents, friends, orlovers; he is no longer a revolutionary if he is swayed bythese relationships.14. Aiming at implacable revolution, the revolutionary mayand frequently must live within society will pretending tobe completely different from what he really is, for hemust penetrate everywhere, into all the higher andmiddle-classes, into the houses of commerce, thechurches, and the palaces of the aristocracy, and into theworlds of the bureaucracy and literature and themilitary, and also into the Third Division and the WinterPalace of the Czar.15. This filthy social order can be split up into severalcategories. The first category comprises those who mustbe condemned to death without delay. Comrades shouldcompile a list of those to be condemned according to therelative gravity of their crimes; and the executionsshould be carried out according to the prepared order.16. When a list of those who are condemned is made, andthe order of execution is prepared, no private sense ofoutrage should be considered, nor is it necessary to payattention to the hatred provoked by these people amongthe comrades or the people. Hatred and the sense ofoutrage may even be useful insofar as they incite themasses to revolt. It is necessary to be guided only by therelative usefulness of these executions for the sake of- 158 -revolution. Above all, those who are especially inimicalto the revolutionary organization must be destroyed;their violent and sudden deaths will produce the utmostpanic in the government, depriving it of its will to actionby removing the cleverest and most energetic supporters.17. The second group comprises those who will be spared forthe time being in order that, by a series of monstrousacts, they may drive the people into inevitable revolt.18. The third category consists of a great many brutes inhigh positions, distinguished neither by their clevernessnor their energy, while enjoying riches, influence, power,and high positions by virtue of their rank. These must beexploited in every possible way; they must be implicatedand embroiled in our affairs, their dirty secrets must beferreted out, and they must be transformed into slaves.Their power, influence, and connections, their wealthand their energy, will form an inexhaustible treasure anda precious help in all our undertakings.19. The fourth category comprises ambitious office-holdersand liberals of various shades of opinion. Therevolutionary must pretend to collaborate with them,blindly following them, while at the same time, pryingout their secrets until they are completely in his power.They must be so compromised that there is no way outfor them, and then they can be used to create disorder inthe State.20. The fifth category consists of those doctrinaires,conspirators, and revolutionists who cut a great figure onpaper or in their cliques. They must be constantly drivenon to make compromising declarations: as a result, themajority of them will be destroyed, while a minority willbecome genuine revolutionaries.21. The sixth category is especially important: women. Theycan be divided into three main groups. First, thosefrivolous, thoughtless, and vapid women, whom we shalluse as we use the third and fourth category of men.Second, women who are ardent, capable, and devoted,but whom do not belong to us because they have not yetachieved a passionless and austere revolutionaryunderstanding; these must be used like the men of thefifth category. Finally, there are the women who are- 159 -completely on our side – i.e., those who are whollydedicated and who have accepted our program in itsentirety. We should regard these women as the mostvaluable or our treasures; without their help, we wouldnever succeed.Attitude of the Society toward the People22. The Society has no aim other than the completeliberation and happiness of the masses – i.e., of thepeople who live by manual labor. Convinced that theiremancipation and the achievement of this happiness canonly come about as a result of an all-destroying popularrevolt, the Society will use all its resources and energytoward increasing and intensifying the evils and miseriesof the people until at last their patience is exhausted andthey are driven to a general uprising.23. By a revolution, the Society does not mean an orderlyrevolt according to the classic western model – a revoltwhich always stops short of attacking the rights ofproperty and the traditional social systems of so-calledcivilization and morality. Until now, such a revolutionhas always limited itself to the overthrow of one politicalform in order to replace it by another, therebyattempting to bring about a so-called revolutionary state.The only form of revolution beneficial to the people isone which destroys the entire State to the roots andexterminated all the state traditions, institutions, andclasses in Russia.24. With this end in view, the Society therefore refuses toimpose any new organization from above. Any futureorganization will doubtless work its way through themovement and life of the people; but this is a matter forfuture generations to decide. Our task is terrible, total,universal, and merciless destruction.25. Therefore, in drawing closer to the people, we mustabove all make common cause with those elements of themasses which, since the foundation of the state ofMuscovy, have never ceased to protest, not only in wordsbut in deeds, against everything directly or indirectlyconnected with the state: against the nobility, thebureaucracy, the clergy, the traders, and the parasitickulaks. We must unite with the adventurous tribes of- 160 -brigands, who are the only genuine revolutionaries inRussia.26. To weld the people into one single unconquerable andall-destructive force – this is our aim, our conspiracy,and our task.e. OccasioneIn the very apocalypse of revolution lies itsredemption. In the wake of its triumph it leaves both acomplete political vacuum and the absence of an agendato fill it.The Russian Revolution was neither begun noraccomplished by the Communists; Lenin emerged as theenduring successor only after an interregnum ofconfusion and indecision: Kerensky’s futile ballet ofnostalgic constitutionalism.The French Revolution was followed by the Terror,ironically subsiding with the ascendancy of an emperor,Napoleon Bonaparte, in place of the beheaded King LouisXVI.The fledgling United States fared little better: Years ofargument following the victory over the British atYorktown produced in 1781 the Articles of Confederationand Perpetual Union, which “perpetuity” managed lessthan a decade before replacement by the Constitution.Even then, in another sixty years, the “more perfectunion” was ripped asunder by the Civil War.The message for MW is clear: The immediate post-revolutionary vacuum is Machiavelli’s occasione: theideal opportunity for the presentation, acceptance, andpromulgation of a previously and carefully devisedkalokagathia, or at least áristos to replace chaos withcivitas.- 161 -E. Identity & Legitimacy1. “Denn die Todten Reiten Schnell” 75Presumably in some blissfully-remote Shangri-la ofcartographic lamas, the nations of Planet Earth are asdefined and pedigreed as they appear on a painted globe.Down in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, however, thisis scarcely the case. National borders change throughwars or factional fiat [as with Russia’s 2014 re-acquisition of the Crimea].Artificial countries are established by departingcolonial masters, as with India and Pakistan by Britain.International collaboration may recognize, if notauthorize entirely new countries out of someone else’sproperty, as the United Nations did regarding the Jewish-proclaimed Israel in 1948.“National” boundaries frequently clash with tribal,ethnic, and/or religious groupings, as in the post-WorldWar I British & French chopfest of the defeated/collapsedOttoman Empire into the wholly-artificial new states ofTurkey, Syria, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Lebanon, andPalestine.After World War II the United Nations outlawedappropriating populations’ sovereign property, except ofcourse where it did so itself, as in the aforementionedrecognition of Israel.In the centuries prior to this convention, to be sure,nations stole from one another all the time, includingterritory which arguably didn’t pre-belong to either party.Thus it was inconceivable that the WesternHemisphere should be considered the legitimate propertyof heathen savages such as the Inca, Toltecs, Aztecs, and75 “... for the dead travel fast.” from the 1773 ballad Lenore byGottfried August Bürger, famously quoted by Bram Stoker in his1897 novel Dracula.- 162 -numerous northern native tribes. Such inconvenienceswere mostly dealt with by complete genocide, withconcentration camps (called “reservations”) for the fewsurvivors.In the enlightened civilization of modernity, these oldfaded and forgotten horrors are at least somewhatritualistically acknowledged and shamed, but never quiteto the point of actually returning any of the loot.2. DilemmaThe author, and perhaps the reader as well, is temptedto see in MindWar an extraordinarily altruistic andhumanitarian mechanism. And so it indeed aspires to be.Nevertheless it must never be forgotten that it is newmedicine applied to injuries to which humanity has longsince become resigned, if not enthused.The true MWarrior must therefore pursue his craftconscientiously while at the same time appreciating itslimitations. There is much that MW can cure; there is agreat deal more that it cannot.Where the identity and legitimacy of specified MWsubjects are concerned, this mechanism confronts itsultimate conditional. The formulation of an áristos orkalokagathia has everything to do with the application ofan appropriate, defining, and fulfilling collectivemorality: the Agathon. This absolutely prerequires anestablished, immutable identity: a stable platform uponwhich to raise the temple: an Acropolis for the Parthenon.During the diagnostic sequence leading to thecampaign-operational Foundation Diagnosis (FD),therefore, due attention must be paid to stresses andimbalances behind and beneath the currently-apparentones. It is folly to “fix” a “nation” whose people mayconsider it nothing of the sort at all, hence would takelittle interest in seeing it polished and prosperous.- 163 -Accordingly it is entirely possible that a thorough FDmay ultimately yield the disconcerting prospectus that, aspredefined, there is in finality no nation to rescue.What may be called for is more invasive surgery: thecomplete redrawing of borders, reidentification ofconstituencies, perhaps to the nascent glory of a newname.In the Middle East of the early 21st Century, twocases-in-point are notably conspicuous: the Kurds andthe Islamic State.Ethnic Kurds inhabit a contiguous area, unofficially“Kurdistan”, including portions of Turkey, Syria, andIraq. To the present this has not asserted itself intoimplacable revolutionary zeal [see above Catechism],though there is constant and varying tension as one ormore of the “legitimate” nations may attempt to reinforceclaims of sovereignty.The flipside of this is that any attempts to improve thenational profiles of those same three claimants whileignoring “Kurdistan” would be, in a word, fatuous.At least the Kurds enjoy a general, if awkward, favorin the eyes of the established international community.Not so the Islamic State, an entity which materializedfrom the post-American-occupation ruin of Iraq.Prior to the 2003 American invasion, SaddamHussein’s regime had been a stable, if authoritarian mixof [minority] Sunni and [majority] Shiite Muslims. Sincethe Sunnis held the reins of governmental power, Iraqserved among other things as a regional counterweight toShiite Iran, indeed to the extent of an exhaustive ifinconclusive war between the two nations 1980-88.In “regime-changing” Iraq following its invasion ofthat country, the United States effectively swept aside theSunnis, leaving no residual alternative but to concoct areplacement from the Shiites. The we-should-have-seen-this-coming result was an Iraqi government significantly- 164 -under the influence, if not outright control of Iran (anation not exactly on America’s Christmas-card list eversince it kicked out the CIA-anointed Shah back in 1979).In Baghdad the newly-empowered Shiites, who hadpreviously suffered oppression, imprisonment, andoccasional execution by the Hussein-regime Sunnis, dulydevoted the next decade to returning the disfavor.The cumulative consequence was an uprising byvarious enclaves of Sunnis, which finally came together asa new nation, announcing itself the Islamic State (IS). 76IS promptly proceeded to assert the normal, time-honored prerogatives of a sovereign nation by defendingits borders and imprisoning or killing foreign attackersand its own disobedient citizens.The problem was that these are the prerogatives ofonly “legitimate” nations, more-or-less equating toUnited Nations recognition, and to date IS has not beengranted this birth certificate.As accordingly an “international bastard” IS’ exerciseof the aforementioned violence is thus not a right but anoutrage, justifying righteous calls by the outraged for itsextermination. IS, territorially vulnerable to the massedmight of superpowers, has unsurprisingly responded byprogressively becoming less “territorial”, morphing into amobile-cellular international attack conglomerate verymuch like its similarly non-territorial predecessor al-Qaida. So its would-be exterminators have traded asingle, tangible target for an unknown, scattered numberof intangible ones: yet another PW strategy leavingsomething to be desired.76 As IS asserted sovereignty over a portion of Syria as well, it becamecolloquially the “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria”, or “ISIS” - arousingat least the author’s indignation on behalf of the ancient Egyptianneter Isis, whose ineffable name is thus, if only coincidentally,blasphemed.- 165 -From a MW perspective, this existing PW response toIS is virtually predesigned to fail. IS is the “rope” in amultidirectional tug-of-war involving Turkey, Syria,Baghdad-Iraq, Iran, the United States, Saudi Arabia,Israel, and Russia [at minimum]. There is obviouslynothing remotely close to a consensus among all thesetuggers - and meanwhile strands of the rope continue toproliferate elsewhere around the world.Were this situation handed over to the MW TriForce,its solution might proceed something like this:1. Immediately remove all PW forces fromthe original IS territory.2. For the duration of the MW campaign,blanket the entire IS, as well as the Syrianand Baghdad capitals, with PSYCONs tominimize antagonism and maximizecreative cooperation.3. Have MFB establish an on-site presencein the IS capital, and open immediatecontact with its government.4. Emplace MFB teams with the Syrian andBaghdad governments.5. Through the three MFB teams, arrangefor Syria and Baghdad to cede their IS-occupied territory to that state in returnfor its further non-expansion.6. Assign PPB teams to accomplish IS’international recognition, e.g. the UnitedNations.- 166 -Áristos is now tentatively established, but the threeMFB teams remain in place, and the MWB PSYCONblanket continues, until stability appears normalized. Atthat point MFB is withdrawn and replaced by PPB in ISonly, to guide its peaceful and constructive developmentas a new nation. The MWB PSYCON blanket iswithdrawn from Syria and Baghdad, but remains in placeover IS until PPB deems it no longer necessary.Now assured of its safety from invasion, IS ceases allof its worldwide paramilitary operations as a condition ofits recognized legitimacy. It provides both Syria andBaghdad with open access to their former territories, tofacilitate impacted residents’ comfort and consideration.This entire MW campaign, if given full internationalcooperation and non-interference, should be completewithin a year of Declaration.F. Metropolis1. TechnostateIn 1960s’ Political Science circles there was increasingspeculation, indeed anticipation of an impending eclipseof the centuries-familiar nation/state frame of referenceby a new monster called the “multinational corporation”.The largest business ventures had begun to establish theirfooting in several industrialized countries around theglobe, as well as resource-extraction operationsthroughout the “third world” of the pre-industrialized.The fear was that such multilocated entities would foregoallegiance to any one parent-state, choosing rather tosupport the most profitable side of any internationaldispute.As the decades rolled onward, this spectre indeedmaterialized, but along with it came a derivative arguably- 167 -even more sinister: the transformation of human valuesinto technological ones.Traditionally the biological human being has been thesubstance of society, whether individually or en masse.But along with the proliferation of computers, “smartphones”, and other population-pervasive cyberneticscame the gradual revaluation of humans not as users of,but as used by these appendages.The conquest of organic life by inorganic machineshas long been a staple of science-fiction, from thebenevolent babysitters of Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot andJack Williamson’s The Humanoids to not-so-benevolentextraterrestrials: Battlestar Galactica’s Cylons, StarTrek’s Borg, and Stargate’s Replicators. But what parentsand educators are suddenly worrying about is somethingmuch more subtle, and unnervingly science-fact: thatiPhone-suckled generations are growing up conditionedto process thoughts more like the machines who areincreasingly their actual babysitters, friends, andteachers.This transition from organic-analogic to inorganic-digitalogic sacrifices intangibles and abstractions for thespeed and precision of either/or simplification.Along the way the metaphysical, divine soul of theindividual human being is first ignored, then discarded,and finally intentionally destroyed as an irrelevantobsolescence. 77Even the most venerable universities, besieged by ageneration of students desperate for a foothold in theincreasingly competitive and shrinking technological jobmarket, are neglecting the Humanities (!) in favor ofcareer-practical curricula.77 To more thoroughly appreciate the danger of such metaphysicalsuicide, see the author’s MindStar (2016).- 168 -In this de-intellectualization environment, aselsewhere, George Orwell foresaw humanity’s regressiontowards the complete atrophy of consciousness:By 2050 - earlier, probably - all real knowledge ofOldspeak will have disappeared. The whole literature of thepast will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton,Byron - they’ll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merelychanged into something different, but actually changed intosomething contradictory of what they used to be. Even theliterature of the Party will change. Even the slogans willchange. How could you have a slogan like “Freedom isSlavery” when the concept of freedom has been abolished?The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact therewill be no thought as we understand it now. Orthodoxymeans not thinking - not needing to think. Orthodoxy isunconsciousness. 78At the beginning of the 20th Century, in ExpressionistGermany, Thea von Harbou envisioned just such a futurein her novel Metropolis, in which only a rarified elite(very much like today’s notorious “1%”) enjoy sybariticleisure while, in hideous subterranean factories, themasses of humanity toil endlessly, mindlessly as slaves ofbehemoth machines. 792. Ultima FuturaThe dismal horror of Metropolis was redeemed byrevolution, but not as Nechayev would have recognized it.It was not an apocalypse of violence, but a reconciliation,or as von Harbou phrased it, “mediation of head andhands by the heart”.Catalyst of this salvation was a beatific woman, Maria- but not before she was kidnapped and duplicated as an78 Syme to Winston Smith in 1984, op. cit. , page #47.79 In 1927 Metropolis was made into the classic motion picture byThea’s husband Fritz Lang.- 169 -evil robotrix, the [in]famous Ultima Futura, who verynearly orchestrated the destruction of the entire polis in anihilistic bacchanale of orgiastic savagery.In this prescient parable may perhaps be glimpsed theMW solution to onrushing technocracy: not insertion ofan even more potent “robotrix” of MWB PSYCONs, butthe PPB invocation of the original, innocent “spirit ofhumanity” - our own “Maria” - to remind and restoreboth “heads” and “hands” of a technostate to the primalinnocence of a shared “heart”.This is perhaps the most elusive of MW avenues toidentify and navigate, but the impulse to find it - themythic Grail Quest - is as old as humanity itself. In anycase there may be no alternative.G. “Learn to Smile”This has been a sobering, indeed chilling chapter towrite, and doubtless to read - speaking as it does to themenagerie of monsters under MW’s bed: complicationsand consternations which can confound otherwise-impeccable MW evaluations, campaigns, and perfections.MW, as refined an art and science as it is, is nonethelesssubject to the schadenfroh curse of Murphy’s Law.The lesson in this for the aspiring MWarrior is toalways temper idealism with pragmatism: to anticipate amenu of more áristos than kalokagathia, and even thento be prepared for an áristos that may only barely suffice.What is important is to seek and realize it nevertheless.In John Fowles’ The Magus, protagonist NicholasUrfe despairs of the rampant hypocrisy he sees about himin the Postmodern world, and very nearly surrenders to itin a battle for his own soul between the “Maria” of histrue love Alison and the “robotrix” of the seductive sirenLily.- 170 -Overseeing Nicholas’ “election” - the sheer hazard ofbeing forced to choose - is the “magus” MauriceConchis ...A figure appeared in the door. It was Conchis. He cameand stood in front of me.“I come to tell you that you are now elect.”I shook my head violently from side to side.“You have no choice.”I still shook my head, but more wearily.He stared at me, with those eyes that seemed older thanone man’s lifetime, and a little gleam of sympathy came intohis expression, as if after all he might have put too muchpressure on a very thin lever.“Learn to smile, Nicholas. Learn to smile.”It came to me then that he meant something different by“smile”: that the irony, the humorlessness, the ruthlessness Ihad always noted in his smiling was a quality he deliberatelyinserted; that for him the smile was something essentiallycruel, because freedom is cruel, because the freedom thatmakes us at least partly responsible for what we are is cruel.Hence for him the smile was not so much an attitude to betaken to life as rather the nature of the cruelty of life, acruelty we cannot even choose to avoid, since it is inherent inhuman existence.He meant something far stranger by “learn to smile”than the banal “grin and bear it”. If anything it meant “learnto be cruel; learn to be dry; learn to survive”.That we have no choice of play or role. It is alwaysOthello. To be is, inexorably, to be Iago.He gave me the smallest of bows, one full of irony, of thecontempt implicit in incongruous courtesy, then went. 80As now this book.80 [Abridged from] Fowles, John, The Magus (revised edition).Boston: Little, Brown & Company, 1977, page #531.[index-171_1.jpg]- 171 -AfterwordThe Prince and the Magician81Once upon a time there was a young prince,who believed in all things but three. He did notbelieve in princesses, he did not believe inislands, he did not believe in God. His father,the king, told him that such things did notexist. As there were no princesses or islands inhis father’s domaines, and no sign of God, theyoung prince believed his father.But then, one day, the prince ran away fromhis palace. He came to the next land. There, tohis astonishment, from every coast he sawislands, and on these islands, strange andtroubling creatures whom he dared not name.As he was searching for a boat, a man in fullevening dress approached him along the shore.“Are those real islands?” asked the youngprince.81 Ibid., pages #550-2.- 172 -“Of course they are real islands,” said theman in evening dress.“ A n d t h o s e s t r a n g e a n d t r o u b l i n gcreatures?”“They are all genuine and authenticprincesses.”“Then God also must exist!” cried the prince.“I am God,” replied the man in full eveningdress, with a bow.The young prince returned home as quicklyas he could.“So you are back,” said his father, the king.“I have seen islands, I have seen princesses, Ihave seen God,” said the prince reproachfully.The king was unmoved.“Neither real islands, nor real princesses,nor a real God, exist.”“I saw them!”“Tell me how God was dressed.”“God was in full evening dress.”“Were the sleeves of his coat rolled back?”The prince remembered that they had been.The king smiled.“That is the uniform of a magician. Youhave been deceived.”At this, the prince returned to the next land,and went to the same shore, where once againhe came upon the man in full evening dress.“My father the king has told me who youare,” said the young prince indignantly. “Youdeceived me last time, but not again. Now I- 173 -know that those are not real islands and realprincesses, because you are a magician.”The man on the shore smiled.“It is you who are deceived, my boy. In yourfather’s kingdom there are many islands andmany princesses. But you are under yourfather’s spell, so you cannot see them.”The prince returned pensively home. Whenhe saw his father, he looked him in the eyes.“Father, is it true that you are not a realking, but only a magician?”The king smiled, and rolled back his sleeves.“Yes, my son, I am only a magician.”“Then the man on the shore was God.”“The man on the shore was anothermagician.”“I must know the real truth, the truthbeyond magic.”“There is no truth beyond magic,” said theking.The prince was full of sadness.He said, “I will kill myself.”The king by magic caused death to appear.Death stood in the door and beckoned to theprince. The prince shuddered. He rememberedthe beautiful but unreal islands and the unrealbut beautiful princesses.“Very well,” he said. “I can bear it.”“You see, my son,” said the king, “you toonow begin to be a magician.”- 174 -[index-175_1.jpg]- 175 -BibliographyThe Bibliography for FindFar isidentical to that of MindWar, as theMW principles and technologies areapplied as pertinent herein.
