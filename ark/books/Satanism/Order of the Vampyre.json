[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Orde r Of The VAm pyre Stateme nt The Order of the Vampy re is a func tion of the Temple of Set. The Order has two Co- Gran d Mast ers, each are Four th Deg ree members of the Templ e of Set. The Orde r also has severa l \"Mas ters\", each of who m has acquir ed and demon strate d an experti se and mast ery of the subject s at hand. Order of the Vampyr e mamb ership is only ava ilable to members of hte Temp le of Set, and onl y thos e who have attaine d the Grade of Adep t (Sec ond Degree) or hig her. Vamp ire lore is thrivi ng. In today 's wor ld, as movie after movie is pumped out, as auth ors who have turne d into book machin es wri te abo ut one sultr y aspe ct of the vamp ire after another, and as Goth s--so called --pose and posture their way into [out of?] societ y, the inter est in Thing s Vamp iric was nev er hig her. When you think about a vampi re (or vampy re), are you compe lled, or rep elled? Are you attrac ted, or repu lsed? Are you draw n in, or wou ld you strik e out in fea r? Much of how we initial ly jud ge and typec ast a candid ate in life depend s upon how thei r appe arance first strik es us. Are they indeed \"striki ng?\" In the case of he vamp ire, is ther e some thing in the way they look, somethin g in the ton e and timbre of their voice, or som ething even less tangibl e, whi ch cau ses us to react to qual ities we bel ieve to be vampiri c? You might wish to ask yours elf this too : Did you stay long enough to deci de whe ther the ima ge was simpl y blac k hair , pale (whi te) make-up and blood- red lips tick, or mor e than image ...a very real ext ension of someone 's Bei ng? If a vam pyre is mere ly a constru ct of part clothin g, par t posi ng, part wan na-be, well; the Order of the Vampyr e woul d have close d its doors very early on indeed. On the other hand, one can-- and many do- --make fine use of clot hing, postur e and bits of real ity to enhan ce a Presenc e whic h is already ther e. Perh aps the one import ant lesson to lear n abou t Thin gs [or peopl e] Vam pyric is that nothi ng is as it seems. For example , most peopl e take the term \"invisib le\" at face value . We take it to mean \"no t seen \". As a proc ess, the Met amind is \"ava ilable \" to us all in the sense that it is an ini tiator y and person al app roach to many of the guises which fall under the hea ding psychic pheno mena. Our New Age soci ety is steep ed in notion s of positiv e vibr ations and harmoni c reso nances . From the hard science of the fifti es to the hard fac ts of the nine ties, we hav e seen a res urgenc e of support for thepowe rs of the mind. We're now at a stage, almost by accident it seems, where we feel that it is \"okay\" to beli eve in somet hing other than blind faith. We have learn ed eno ugh about self- reli ance to know that our educatio n begi ns and ends in dir ect proporti on to hoe expa nsive our viewpoin ts hav e beco me. We have taken the physical , push ed it, tried to underst and it, and throug h it, arrive d at higher truths about our world, ours elves, our powers. The Metamin d--kno wn as the psi-fact or, ESP, psy chic abil ities or by any other name-- is that which allows the seasone d \"use r\" to expl oit his spec ial abilitie s. Peop le fee l that paran ormal, or psychic powers are the res ult of a Gif t. Thi s may be true for some . [Tho ugh a discus sion on the Gift giver would prove lively! ] For othe rs, acquirin g \"met amenta l\" pow ers is just that; skills , trut hs or energi es whic h are alread y know n are re-acq uired. Throu gh thi s proc ess, they may beco me \"met amenta l\". In some, there is both an inner recogn ition, and the dyn amic process of working with the Gift to re-acq uire skills. One does not so much acquire new skil ls, however, as much as he fin e tune s thos e he already has. Is it so remarka ble to think that a clai rvoyan t, for examp le, is someo ne who has take n the power of sig ht to new heights?

This is not meant to sound easy. What may be easy to say could evolv e into a life-lon g purs uit; one cou ld stl l come up empty. That is the risk all true expl orers take. While we may not be born with this aspect of the Gift, neith er can ever yone develop what they'r e born with.
