It is f ull of fire, conviction, d epth and intellectual po wer—as well as som e devilis h winks. W hen people ask m e, “ What kind of man is Peter H. Gilm ore? W hy did you appoint him High Priest? ” I’d wish there was one book I could give them that would effectively s howcase this m ulti-faceted indiv idua list. Yes, I c ould eas ily direc t inqu irers to our website where one can find m any terri fic edicts and essays written by our new High Priest, or to back issues of The Black Flame , where earlier versions of m any of these essays were incarnated, or I could just be a dictator ial ass and respond (preferably with a th ick, fake-Hungarian /Germ anic accent), “Because I k now what is in his sou l and I appointed him to the role he had earned! Ho w dare you question m y judgm ent!” That last bit would be a tad out of character, and not ve ry Satanic. We aren’t too keen on taking things “on faith” and, while we all enjoy wi cked posturing once in awhile, m embers of the Church of Satan deserve m ore than that. What kind of m an is Peter H. Gilm ore? Dr. LaVey and I m et Magus Gilmore, and his m agically-adapt wife ( now High Priestess) P eggy Nadr am ia, at Izzy’s chophouse one drizzly autumn night in San Francisco in 1986. They were poised, ar ticulate, respectful. They both seem ed to have a solid grasp of the dark evocations of Sa tanism , as well as th e flashier, Coney Island aspects that blended so naturally in Anton LaVey’s heart, and im pressed them selves on his Church. Dr. La Vey was intrigued enough to invite the m back to th e Black House after dinner for conversation and m usic until the wee hours...and that was just the fi rst of m any long nights togeth er over the next 11 years. The “Satanic Panic” was just beginning to rumble, and, after a short probation, we assigned our new cohorts in the East various adm inistrative and pub licity tasks to test their m ettle. They rose to the o ccas ion at every turn, facilitating bu t ne ver in trudin g, following our High Priest’s l ead, having the ego strength to never chafe under his direction. T ogether with othe r representatives around the globe , we weathered the panic. Dr. LaVey welcom ed Peter and Peggy as va luable and unfalteri ng assets to his organization. Early on, Peggy Na dram ia unde rstood the power and potential of the Intern et and created a presence for u s there. Quite seam lessly over tim e, they becam e our Media Coordinators, designed our website an d developed the Special Interest Groups, which with the reinvigoration of the Grotto sy ste m, allowed f ellow Satanists the f ocus ed, productive contact we all fi nd so enlivening. Already pub lishing the excellent horror fiction m agazine Grue , they began publishing Th e Black F lame , which quickly developed into the prem iere forum for Satanic thought. Through the years, Peter revealed him self to be anachronistic, alm ost courtly, betraying m anne rs and se nsibilities n ot of this er a, yet very m uch suited to it. As you’ll s ee in h is writings, he sh ares an elem ent of genuine "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"idealism m any Satanists harbor, contrasting starkly with the various and vocal Goodguy- badge victim ization cults ra mpant in our wider society. When the tim e ca me for fresh, invigorat ing blood five years ago, the choice for High Priest becam e obvious to m e. Years ago, when som e young Turk would come on the scene, claim ing to be the great black hope of Satanism , Dr. LaVey used to say, “Can he com e up with the goods?” Not ego. Ego is easy—we’re Satanists! But the man I needed had to have m uch m ore substance than that. He couldn’t just be another guy in a swirling black cape loo king to get his face in front of th e c ameras. W hat goes on in front of the cameras is only a m ere sliver of wh at actua lly h as to ge t do ne to keep this organization going. The new High P riest has to be the Head Adm inistrator, m aking sure all the jobs are getting done at the sam e time. He has no tim e for snoozing com fortably on his diabolical throne or preen ing in front of the glass. Qu estions have to be answered, attacks m ust be deftly parried. And the im petus to keep the organization going has to com e from extraordinary c onviction that what you are advocating is right. Peter H. Gilm ore has fulfilled these requirements nine -fold. The stren gth and reso nance you read in these essays doesn’t com e from empty ego and posturing—it com es from deep understanding and hard-won wisdom. In a way, Pe ter has both the best and the worst job in the world. On the one hand, he has, through years of dedication, risen to the position of being the foremost representative of Satanic principles on Eart h. He has th e satisf action of contributing substantially every day to a ph ilosophy that he has held deep allegian ce to since he was 13 years old. On the other hand, he is following in the footsteps of the found of our religion. He has precepts he is bound to adhere to, yet m ust also fo llow his own heart to guide us into virgin territory, form ing new policies and exploring new attitudes as we move forward. W orld situations change. How does Satanism apply in these ne w circum stances? Anton L aVey gave us a philoso phy that allows for evolution and constant change. W e require a confident leader who can get past spewing party line rhetoric and dogm a, who can take the them es and courag eously refine as needed. He cannot be constrained by the past, but he should build constructively on our foundations. Inevitably, he m ust fend off criticis m both from within and without. Few would dar e question Anton LaVey’s judgm ent; he’s the founder, he m ust know what he’s doing. But those after him are fair gam e for arm chair advice Magus Gilm ore has risen to the ta sk admirably, proving him self a steady and capable lead er. As he hi mself brings out in his “Overture”, our High priest sees his role not as di ctator but as Director, patien tly recognizing and drawing forth the bes t in each of us (unless some upstart deserves a firm kick in the keis ter— he’s enthusiastic ally comm itted to tha t form of therap y, as well). One m agical skill Anton LaVey possessed was a keen perception of people. As Peter has m atured over the past twenty years I’ve known him, he’s grown quite worldly, as well—not that he w as anyone’s fool to begin with. B ut being a Church of Satan adm inistrato r places on e in an unequalled position to m eet som e vita l, driven hu man beings, as well as som e unique ly s cabrous rog ues. Sorting the wheat from the chaff is essential, and Peter Gilm ore has becom e a m aster. Because the cohesion of our philosophy is at stake, his efforts (though they m ay at tim es seem ruthless and uncom prom ising to others) are central to ou r continued survival. Under his leadership, concentrating his attentions on those who deserve it and gi ving the bum ’s rush to those dissonant few the Church of Satan has flour ished.

"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Overture O N AP RIL 8 th OF 1966, TIME magazine em blazoned its black cover with the stark question, “Is God Dead? ” On April 30 th , Anton Szandor LaVey delivered the answ er by proclaim ing the birth of the Age of Satan w ith the founding of the Church of Satan. Both events im pacted the world of religion, revitali zin g Nietzsc he’s vision of the lib eration of hum anity from the dominance of Christian m orality. LaVey noted in The Satanic B ible , published in Dece mber of 1969, a num ber of pi eces of evidence for this new Satanic age. Over the succeeding y ears, corrob oration has continued. The perceptive have been enjoying that show. In 1998, Episcopalian B ishop John Shelby Spong published a book entitled Why Christianity Must Change or Die . It acknowledges the irrationa lity of past Christian beliefs and argues for a new im age of God as sim ply the “Ground or Being for the Universe,” and for Chris t as a symbolic gateway to this inactiv e God. I relished seeing a prom inent m ember of a m ajor Christian deno mination adm itting that the past m odel of God m ust perish o r the ir entire relig ion will wither becaus e it is agains t hum an nature. Dr. LaVey’s joke about God needing MEDICARE and his prediction that the “Jesus character” would be considered a well-known fo lk m yth by 2000 c.e. seem to have been on target. While topless nuns have yet to perfor m the “Missa Solemnis Rock,” there have been other concerts of equi valent blasphem y. I stood on a steel balcony, in the nave of what was once an elegant stone chu rch in the heart of m idtown Manhattan. Below m e a stage replaced the consecrated space previously supporting a Ch rstian altar. On that now carnal precinct, m embers of The Ele ctric He llfire Club, a band of Satanists who use the techno-m agic of electricity in their sonic e vocations, proudly celebrated their Luciferian heritage. L ead singer Thom as Thron, a P riest in the Church of Satan, was the commanding front m an. His m uscular ta ttooed arm s gleamed in the inf ernal f lash ing of the laser lights. The plastic red horns stuck to his forehead gave the proper tone of mockery to his presence. He shouted out “G od is Dead, Satan Lives!” and this gruff incantation was echoed through the speakers by the sam pled voices from the soundtrack to Rom an Polanski’s “R osem ary’s Baby”—a fi lm with connections to Magus LaVey and the early years of our Church. The resonance was powerful. As Thorn capered abou t the stag e, the b lack -garbed aud ience swayed to th e savage dance beat supporting these im pious incantations. Thorn raised his left arm and thrusted forth his fingers in the cornu — the Devil’ s salute. “Ha il SATAN!” was his pr im al scream . The throng sm artly returned this gesture, joining in on the c horus enthusiastically celebrating the trium ph of Satan. I smiled.

The cam araderie I’ve shared with these two brilliant and powerful Satanic W itches has en rich ed m e immeasurably. On the night that my wife took her pl ace at my side as High Prieste ss, I sh ared with our m embers a m etaphor I have used to explain my conceptio n of m y position and duties as High P ries t. Since I am a m usician, having studied both conducting and com position, I often tend to cast my i magery based on this significan t part of m y creativ e pra ctice. I see the Church of Satan as resembling a vast sym phony orchestra of dia bolical virtuosos, each with skills in playing their unique “instrum ents”—their talents. I am now the conductor and m usic director of this es teem ed ensem ble, and th e “s core” of wh ich I le ad u s in perform ance is the philosophy of Satanism com posed by Anton LaVey and e mbodied in his m any works. As is the regular practi ce of conductors, I have studied both the historical co ntext as well as m ade an in-depth analysis of Dr. LaVey’s score, so that m y inte rpre tatio n is author itative. Havin g worked f or m any years direc tly with the com poser him self has also provided m e with necessary insights into his unique m ethods and m eans. This Sinfonia Diabolica , which we perform with the m aximum engage ment of our passions, is one with m any concerta nte passages, calling for players to com e forth fr om the textu re o f the ensem ble and “sin g solo” with great ardor. It is a sco re that also allows for cadenzas—passages wherein soloists soar in brilliant im provisation supported by the ground base of Satanism ’s carnal philosophy. A nd also it is a score that allows for continued expansion—ever m ore colorful elabor ations of its orchestr ation as conditions change and evolving possibilities present them selves. Those who are not well-versed in classical m usic perform ance m ight not be aw are that it has long b een the practice of conductors to adjust th e scores they are playing to ta ke advantage of the continuing developm ent of the instrum ents in the orches tra, facilitatin g greater ex pression of the intentions of the com pos er. And so it is m y task to evolve the im ple mentation of Maestro LaVey’s philosophical m asterpiece, as I do my utm ost to galvanize you all in this continuing “concert of Prom ethean music” aris ing for m the very heart of the Inferno. This book is a collection of my essays written fro m 1987 C.E. to 2006 C.E., m any of which were published in The B lack Flame . I’ve m ade expansions and contractions in an effort to sharpen their focus. You should no te that som e pieces refer to incid ents that occurred proxim ate to their creatio n. There are a num ber of pieces written as rabble- rousing rhetoric during the “S atanic Panic,” when we had to defend ourselves alm ost daily from accusations s pread by Ch ristian fund am entalist f anatics th at Satanism was a conspiracy of devil-worshiping ch ild m urders. We were u nder fire and legislation had been proposed to m ake Satanism illegal, ba sed on these nonsensical claim s. Those laws were not passed. W e sur vived and have thrived.

Now that we have passed the fortieth anniversary of that fateful night, has the world begun to understand the real meaning behind the only organized religion in history to take as its symbol the ultimate figure of pride and rebellion, and to many, of Evil? And are there truly some grounds for people to feel fear at the evergrowing phenomenon of contemporary Satanism? As the High Priest of the Church of Satan, I can candidly say, “Yes!” However, what the general populace has decided to fear is a ludicrous portrait that has been painted in lurid Technicolor by media hypesters intent on titillation, unscrupulous evangelists struggli ng to fill their coffers and keep their mistresses in jewelry, and most distressingly by a segment of the therapeutic community who have found a goldmine in the treatment of so-called “ritual abuse survivors” who provide no evidence of their tales of terror, save for their fervent belief that they were victimized. These fictions ar e remarkably similar to stories told by women labeled by Freud as hysterics. I shall not waste time in refuting the absurd claim that there is an international conspiracy of generati onal Satanists bent on enslaving the world through drug use and the sacrifice of babies bred for that purpose by emotionally unstable women. That mythology has been thoroughly exploded by other sources I . Let us instead look at contemporary Satanism for what it really is, a religion of elitism and Social Darwinism that seeks to re-establish the reign of the able over the idiotic, of swift justice over sluggish injustice, and for a wholesale re jection of egalitarianism as a myth that has crippled the advancement of the human species for the last two thousand years. Is that something to fear? If you’re one of the majori ty of human mediocrities merely existing as a media-besotted drone, you bet it is! The philosophy of Satanism is delineated in the writings of Anton Szandor LaVey. His books include The Satanic Bible, The Satanic Rituals, The Satanic Witch, The Devil’s Notebook and Satan Speaks. All are currently in print and should be consulted by anyone interested in a complete picture of the views held by the Church of Satan. One can obtain further information by reading The Secret Life of a Satanist, the authorized biography of Anton LaVey (Feral House) and The Church of Satan (Hell’s Kitchen   I The FBI’s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime: Investigator’s Guide to Allegation of Ritual Child Abuse, January 1992; the Committee for Scientific Examination of Religion’s report Satanism in America , October 1989; the British Government’s Department of Health report: The Extent and Nature of Organized and Ritual Abuse, HMSO, 1994."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Productions), two books by Blanche Barton, the biographer and longtime companion to Dr. LaVey and a member of the Council of Nine. These works present abundant material regarding the history and contemporary practices of the Church of Satan. For those who have yet to study this literature there are three sets of brief guidelines II issued over the years by the Church, authored by LaVey, which can give the uninitiated a capsulized version of Satanic philosophy. The first are the “Nine Satanic Statements” (copyright 1969) which open The Satanic Bible and give a firm foundation for the Satanist. They are: 1. Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence! 2. Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe dreams! 3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self-deceit! 4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates! 5. Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek! 6. Satan represents responsi bility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires! 7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all! 8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins , as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification! 9. Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years! The next statements, “The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth” (copyright 1967), were written at about the same time, but were then considered too frank and brutal for general release and issued only to the membership. Here is the Lex Satanicus, a law of the jungle for social interaction: 1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked. 2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them. 3. When in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there. 4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy. 5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal. 6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved. 7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained. 8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself. 9. Do not harm little children. 10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food. 11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.

Satanists acknowledge that we are human and work towards perfection, but can sometimes fall into negative patterns of action. Thus was born the list of the “Nine Satanic Sins” (copyright 1987), guidelines for what Satanists consider to be non-productive behavior to be recognized and eliminated from one’s daily existence. 1. Stupidity —The top of the list for Satanic Sins. The Cardinal Sin of Satanism. It’s too bad that stupidity isn’t painful. Ignorance is one thing, but our society thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on people going along with whatever they are told. The media promot es a cultivated stupidity as a posture that is not only acceptable but laudable. Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be stupid. 2. Pretentiousness —Empty posturing can be most irritating and isn’t applying the cardinal rules of Lesser Magic. On equal footing with stupidity for what keeps the money in circulation these days. Everyone’s made to feel like a big shot, whether they can come up with the goods or not. 3. Solipsism —Can be very dangerous for Satanists. Projecting your reactions, responses and sensibilities onto someone wh o is probably far less attuned than you are. It is the mistake of expecting people to give you the same consideration, courtesy and respect that you naturally give them. They won’t. Instead, Satanists must strive to apply the dictum of “Do unto others as they do unto you.” It’s work for most of us and requires constant vigilance lest you slip into a comfortable illusion of everyone being like you. As has been said, certain utopias would be ideal in a nation of philosophers, but unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, from a Machiavellian standpoint) we are far from that point. 4. Self-deceit —It’s in the “Nine Satanic Statements” but deserves to be repeated here. Another cardinal sin. We must not pay homage to any of the sacred cows presented to us, including the roles we are expected to play ourselves. The only time self-deceit should be entered into is when it’s fun, and with awareness. But then, it’s not self-deceit! 5. Herd Conformity —That’s obvious from a Satanic stance. It’s all right to conform to a person’s wishes, if it ultimately benefits you. But only fools follow along with the herd, letting an impersonal entity dictate to you The key is to choose a master wisely instead of being enslaved by the whims of the many. 6. Lack of Perspective —Again, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and what you are, and what a threat you can be, by your very existence. We are making history right now, every day. Always keep the wider historical and social picture in mind. That is an important key to both Lesser and Greater Magic. See the patterns and fit things together as you want the pieces to fall into place. Do not be swayed by herd constraints—know that you are working on another level entirely from the rest of the world. 7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies —Be aware that this is one of the keys to brainwashing people into accepting something new and different, when in"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" reality it’s something that was once wide ly accepted but is now presented in a new package. We are expected to rave about the genius of the creator and forget the original. This makes for a disposable society. 8. Counterproductive Pride —That first word is important. Pride is great up to the point you begin to throw out the ba by with the bathwater. The rule of Satanism is: if it works for you, great . When it stops working for you, when you’ve painted yourself into a corner and the only way out is to say, I’m sorry, I made a mistake, I wish we could compromise somehow, then do it. 9. Lack of Aesthetics —This is the physical application of the Balance Factor. Aesthetics is important in Lesser Magic and should be cultivated. It is obvious that no one can collect any money off classical standards of beauty and form most of the time so they are discouraged in a consumer society, but an eye for beauty, for balance, is an essential Satanic tool and must be applied for greatest magical effectiveness. It’s not what’s supposed to be pleasing—it’s what is. Aesthetics is a personal thing, reflective of one’s own nature, but there are universally pleasing and harmonious configurations that should not be denied. This material sums up the rudiments of Satanic philosophy. It certainly has nothing to do with the prevailing Judeo-Christian outlook of altruism and self-sacrifice, and can thus seem quite alien and frightening to one brou ght up in that worldvi ew. Realistically, the Satanic code of behavior is based on human nature as it is and thus comes naturally to most carnal people who have not been deeply indoctrinated in anti-life and anti-rational belief systems. It is a fact that many peop le today call themselves Christians but really have no clear concept as to what that philosophy fully entails, so they generally behave in a Satanic fashion. We think that it is high time that this is recognized and that people call themselves what they truly are, not what is socially convenient for them. As you can see, there are no elements of devil worship in the Church of Satan.Such practices are looked upon as being Christian heresies. Believing in the Christian worldview of God vs. the Devil and choosing to side with the Prince of Darkness is pointless to the Satanist as neit her exists. Additionally, we do not believe in the supernatural. To the Satanist, he is his own God. Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates. Some Sa tanists extend this symbol to encompass the evolutionary “force” of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all livi ng things. To the Satanist, Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather it is a name for the reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will. Thus, the practice of sacrifice is rejected by Satanists as being a Christian aberration—in Satanism there’s no deity to which one can make a sacrifice. Satanists do at times have experience of the supernormal in their practice of ritual or Greater Magic. This is a technique in tended primarily as self-transformational psychodrama, but which may be used as an attempt towards influencing the outcome of human events to desired ends. In the context of a theatrical, stimulat ing ritual an extreme emotional state is reached, sending forth a vision of what you want to occur (the Is-To- Be), which, if your levels of adrenaline ar e high enough, might permeate the unconscious minds of those you wish to influence, causing them to behave as you desire when the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" time is right. This does not mean that anythi ng is possible, for it takes a great deal of energy to make a strong sending, and it is often difficult to influence events from the inertia of their present directions. Satanists consider that effective Greater Magic may be a talent, and that different individuals may have varying capacities for “sending and receiving.” Awareness of your abilities and wh at is possible to achieve is one of the hallmarks of a successful Satanic magician. Additionally, Satanists do not use faith as a tool of cognition, hence there is no requir ement to accept Greater Magic as anything more than self-therapy. It is up to each Satanist to examine any “interesting coincidences” following their rituals and based on evidence decide whether more is in motion. Satanists also practice Lesser Magic, which is basica lly the day-to-day manipulation of your fellows to obtain your ends. Detailed techniques are given in The Satanic Witch . In the recent past we have seen certain evangelists and even misinformed academics calling Satanism a ne o-Nazi movement. This is an inaccurate label. The Nazi movement drew much of its power from a racist doctrine of Aryan superiority. Satanism is far more discerning than that. While there are provable biological differences between the races and statistically demonstrable performa nce levels in various ac tivities, it is quite irrational to think that someone can be advanced or not simply because of the color of their skin. Even if one comes from promising genetic stock, and by that we mean from ancestors who have proven their abilities to be superior in performance, this does not guarantee an individual’s advancement. We recognize individual merit, and ascribe no value to bloodlines. Satanists only deem indi viduals as being “elite” if they prove it by cultivating their naturally endowed abilities to the highest extent possible. This is something that requires the Satanic virtue of discipline, a quality we try to instill in our own “iron youth.” There are thus outstanding individuals from all ethnic backgrounds, and they are embraced by Satanism for the superior beings that they are—creating a uniquely trans-cultural tribe of carnal people. Satanists treasure individualism, hardly so mething to be gained by goose-stepping en mass down the street. Yet we do not embrace an “anything goes” atmosphere wherein all values are relative and nothing rises above the sludge of commonality. Satanism encourages a return to more traditional values in art and literature such as mastery of technique and emotional communication, of form and function, design and execution. Satanists find a wealth of material in Western culture to be treasured for the pinnacle of human achievements that they are, and no t to be buried under the swill of multi- culturalist attempts to displace them with dubious achievements simply because they are non-Western as has become rampant in some academic and artistic circles. We call to each individual to seek human greatness wherever it can be found, from the vaults of history and from the talented producers of the present, and to deride the trendy shams for the shallow façades that they are. Since Satanism stands for acceptance of Man as an animal, there have often been creators in many past cultures who embraced this insight and explored it in the context of their society, thus Satanists seek out these artistic and philosophical expressions and see them to be the “roots” of our current awareness of our human type. Satanists see the social structure of humanity as being stratified, thus each person reaches a level commensurate with the development (or lack thereof) of their natural talents. The principle of the survival of the strong is advocated on all levels of society, from allowing an individual to stand or fall to even letting those nations that cannot handle themselves take the consequences of this inability. Any assistance on all"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" levels should be on a “quid pro quo” basis. There would be a concomitant reduction in the world’s population as the weak are allowed to experience the consequences of Social Darwinism if this rational and just principa l were put into operation. Thus has Nature always acted to cleanse and strengthen her children. This is harsh, but that is the way of the world. We embrace reality and do not try to transform it into some utopia that is contrary to the very fabric of existence. Practical application of this doctrine would see the complete cessation of welfare systems, an end to no-strings attached foreign aid and new programs to award and encourage gifted individuals in all fields to pursue personal excellence. A meritocracy would replace the practice of such injustices as affirmative action and other programs designed to punish the able and reward the undeserving. The natural generosity of some of the successful and affluent would not be curtailed, but it would also not be state-mandated. Satanists also seek to enhance the laws of nature by concentrating on fostering the practice of eugenics. This is not some exotic doctrine hatched in the brains of Third Reich medical madmen. It is the practice of encouraging people of talent and ability to reproduce, to enrich the gene pool from which our species can grow. This was commonly practiced throughout the world as even a text on eugenics endorsed by the Women’s Christian Temperance Union proves, until it was given a bad name by Nazi excesses. Until the genetic code is fully manipulability and we can choose the character of our offspring at will, Satanists seek to mate th e best with the best. Satanists who know that they can pass on genetic defects would refrain from reproducing. Again, this is a practice that is a personal option, not a governmentally enforced dictate. Most Satanists are particularly disgusted by the extraordinary level of criminal activity that abounds today, thus they advoca te a return to the Roman Lex Talionis—let the punishment fit in kind and degree the crime. To achieve this, we would be pleased to see the institution of an elite police force, of men and women in peak physical and mental condition, trained in advanced techniques of crime fighting who would be ably equipped to handle the vermin that make so many of our cities into little more than concrete jungles. Man is by nature a social creature and makes his social contract with his fellows, thus rules of conduct are established to allow maximum freedom for individuals to interact. Disobey those rules and punishment must be swift and sure, and most probably public as well. This does not mean the incarceration of individuals in institutions at the expense of the victims for so-called “rehabilitation.” No, th ese criminals should be put to some use, perhaps as forced labor to even clean up the environment that has so carelessly been soiled under the dominance of Christian spiritual philosophy that sees man as superior to other living creatures with a “God-given right” to abuse them at will. Man is an animal, and must go back to acting like one—not soiling his own lair as only twisted humans do. The Church of Satan pursues a five-point plan to move society in directions that are considered to be beneficial to Satanists. The first point is the advocacy of general recognition and acceptance of stratification, which is no less than the elimination of egalitarianism wherever it has taken root. Mediocrity shall be identified and despised. The stupid should suffer for their behavior. Th e truly beautiful and magnificent are to be cherished. Each individual must choose for himself his own aesthetic standards, but we think that there are certain elements of achievement that are undeniable, even if they are not satisfying to everyone. For example, one cannot deny the superior accomplishment inherent in a Beethoven symphony, a Michelangelo sculpture, a da Vinci painting, or a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Shakespeare play. Many Satanists are working to create their own citadels of excellence outside of the cultural mainstream and have preserved the worthy from the past and continue to create new works of power to be revealed to those who will be appreciative. The second point is the enforcement of st rict taxation of all churches. This would remove the government sanction of religion and force these parasites to live off of their own members alone, and if they can’t, then they will perish as they should. The Church of Satan has never pursued tax-exempt status and challenges all the rest of the world’s churches to stand on their own feet. Let us expose the vampiric nature of the organized religions and see if they can cease their parasitism. Third, we call for th e re-establishment of Lex Talionis throughout human society. The Judeo-Christian tradition, which exists secularly under the guise of “liberal humanism,” has too often exalted the criminal over the victim, taking responsibility away from the wrong-doer with their doctrine of forgiveness. Such thinking is a disgrace towards the ideal of justice. This must stop. Individuals must be held accountable for the consequences of their actions, and not be allowed to scapegoat society, history, or other supposed “outside” influences. It should come as no surprise that many Satanists are part of law enforcement agencies, and that there are a large number of people throughout this and other criminal justice systems who fully ag ree with Satanic philosophy on this point. If the law is not being enforced, Satanists advocate the practice of seeking personal justice, but you are warned to be fully aware of the consequences of such actions in today’s corrupt society. With the present state of affairs, the outcry may yet come to welcome justice back to stay. Fourth, Satanists advocate a new industry, the development and promotion of artificial human companions. These “humanoids” w ill be constructed to be as realistic as possible, and available to anyone who can afford one. Recognizing that the human animal often raises himself up through the denigration of another, this would provide a safe outlet for such behavior. Have the lover of your dreams, regardless of your own prowess; every man a king who can purchase his own subject; or contrary-wise, buy the master you wish to serve. Freedom of choice to satisfy your most secret desires with no one to be bothered is now at hand. What could be better for blowing-off the tension that exists throughout our society, and promoting healthier interaction? Finally we advocate the construction of total environments, technologically up-to- date but theatrically convincing, to be literal pleasure domes and places of amusement and delight. We have seen the beginnings in some of the major theme parks, but let us take them on to the heights depicted in films like Westworld. Here you would be able to indulge in whatever environment you can imagine. Recreation of past history would not only be ripe for these constructions, but scie nce fiction and fantasy will provide fertile sources for many of these playgrounds. Resorts of this nature grow more abundant every year. Would the average person be able to spot a member of the Church of Satan? Since Satanists cover the total spectrum of economic and professional achievement, unless someone is sporting a Sigil of Baphomet medallion, or wearing the Baphomet lapel pin signifying an official representative, you really cannot pin down a Satanist by appearance and behavior alone. In their daily practices, Satanists are individuals who are enjoying their lives in the here and now. They eat what they please, dress as they please, and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" generally follow whatever life style suits them best, so long as it is within the laws of their country of residence. There is no requirement for participa tion in ritual activ ity. The techniques presented in our literature are for members to make use of as th ey so desire. Some Satanists enjoy the social atmosphere of group ritual and seek out others for this purpose. Many Satanists find their ritual activity to be very personal and prefer to remain solitary. Either path is acceptable to the Church of Satan. Indeed, there are no rules for frequency of ritual activity. Some traditionally celebrate the equinoxes and sols tices as holidays, but of course one’s own birthday is the highest Satanic holiday of the year. The ritual process is often used as a cathartic, to cleanse the individual of desires that could turn into compulsions if they remained unfulfilled, thus such practices take the place of therapy. Satanists cherish their individuality and do not try to conform to others’ standards of normality. Also, Satanists do not proselytize, so you will not find yourself approached by someone in a black cloak waving tracts in your face. We have our literature readily available, and should some find the philosophy to be to their liking they may approach us to investigate the possibility of affiliation ( www.churchofsatan.com ). The general public would probably be surprised to find that they have been interacting with Satanists for many years, and that these Satanists will be some of the most interesting, fair, trustworthy, and enjoyable people that they know. The world, when more fully permeated by the primary values of Satanism, will provide a challenging environment wherein you can achieve much, or little, based on the level of input you can muster and the extent of your natural abilities. Yes, this is frightening to the masses wishing to sit back and be herded from one media-hyped product to the next. Our worldview challenges you to think, and do something with those thoughts! As ultimate realists, we do not expect a large percentage of the human population to have the energy and discipline needed to excel, nor would a Satanic society attempt to force people to do that which is beyond their capabilities—but we will not refrain from judging these people by our standards. Those who wish to lead a drugged existence, whether the addictive element is chemical or media, shall be recognized for the slaves that they are and held in contempt. They can continue their self-destructive paths if so desired, but they shall not be allowed to hold back those who want to achieve greatness. Don’t worry, you who have been fooled into believing the paper tiger displayed by today’s media; we Satanists aren’t afte r your children, for they are probably as hopelessly mediocre as their parents. But we are moving the world towards a state wherein the freeloaders will either work or st arve, and the parasites will be removed to wither and die. So, you need only fear real Satanism if you are a criminal, a parasite, or a wastrel. Are you afraid?

It is this second type that feels a self-a lienation that is the cause for self-hatred, leading to disgust for the body which is constan tly being thw arted in its natural desires. This Ethereal im pulse is behind the m ajor sp iritual re lig ions that hav e sp read th eir loathing for life over our globe. The Carnal in dividuals have difficu lty perceiving what the Ethereal wishes to purge from hi mself. Indeed, the Carnals are usually too busy enjoying life to worry about such illusory concerns. But to th e Ethereal, this is a very tangible dichotom y, one that m ust be rem edied. Often they employ asceticism to rid them selves of fleshly impurities, s tifling any ple asure they f eel. Ultim ately this r esults in universal masochism , a reveling in the agony of “purification.” Since the Carnal types can’t even b egin to sp lit them selves in this fashio n, the Ethereal sees them as incurably im pure and will of ten ex term inate su ch indiv idua ls to r id th emselves of rem inders of what they cannot be: harmoniously in tune with their nature as living beings.

The Ethereal is estranged from him self, a truly dangerous and destructive alie nation that has caused cen turies of pain and devastation.

In the West, Christianity has occupi ed a great deal of tim e as one m eans for control. Its ideologues succe ssfully duped the faithful into accepting the idea that their natura l impulses were sinful to God (whom they conveniently couldn’t contact for verification), and th at the Church was needed to c leanse folk o f what they can’t help doing (they’re all sinners) in preparation for som e m ythical af terlif e which was guaranteed to be better than the one through which they currently suffered.

Those who are truly aware laugh at the spectacle of people who actually think that they have evolved to be unique by purchasing a particular brand of running shoes or a sports utility vehicle. And it is fascinating to note that those two particular products ar e sim ilar in design. They are bought by people who neither run, nor drive in terrains that requi re such m eans of transport.

"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" In m ore elaborate so cial situations as sessing the m any factors that determ ine who indeed has the “Migh t” becom es rather a daunting task.

However, if tem pting to see with c larity a nd accu racy is the lo t of those who would understand the true n ature of the human anim al. We m ust be dilig ent and percep tive if we want to retain som e modicu m of cont rol over our lives. “Might” could m ean superior weaponr y, a larger body of ar med troops, a better- trained corp s of soldiers. It cou ld also m ean a populace who is m ore dogged in resistin g atta ck, havin g an uncomprom ising will, o r sim ply being so n umerous tha t the agg ress or cannot prevail against such a m ass of anim al bodies. And this barely scratche s the surface of the m any elem ents that are involved in hum an interactions on a societal level involving the elem ents of force. We ha ven’t even begun to exam ine the levels of power inherent in cultu res th emselves, and the living ideas in th em that can overwhelm other cultures that might seem to have supe rior m ilitary power. Consider this: A well-arm ed man carrying gr enades and an assault rifle is in the depths of a swa mp. He wades through the muck in which there lives hundreds of thousands of tiny leeches. One leech is clea rly no t a m atch for our soldier who doesn’t even need to avail him self of his exotic weaponry—his m ere fingers can make him the victo r. Holding his gun o ver-head, he pro ceeds th rough the neck-deep ooze. Once he em erges and then soon stum bles in a weakened condition, h e begins to s trip his clothes from his body and finds that thousands of ten acious m ouths are now draining him of his very life’s blood. He tears them from him self, stomping them to death in his fury, but the wounds continue to b leed because of the an ti-co agulant em ployed by the sm all feasters. He notes, as his consciousness fa des, that he is now too weak to rip the rest of them from him self. He has been vanquished. Groups of hum ans can be like these leeches in having the ability to overwhelm what looks to be a superior aggressor. The “Might” in this encounter belongs to those little eager leeches, and they were merely trying to assert their view of wha t is “Right”— their individual nourishm ent. And that brings us to the second half of the equation, the term “Right.” “Right” in this context does not m ean, “True,” which I’d define as being wholly consistent with objective reality. “Right” sim ply m eans the sub jectiv e outco me desired by each of th e participants in the conflict which is unde r observation. “Right” is a m atter of value judgm ent, not of determ ining objective facts. Naturally, m ost hum ans would like to think that their value judgm ents really should be seen as being objectively factual, and m any religions and political organizations do claim that such is the case. We Satanists are well aware that su ch things are m ere hum an convention, dependent u pon cultu re and practice, not objec tiv e reality. W e understand that all hum an values are s ubjective. T hey are based on each in dividual’s axiom atic prem ises, his bottom -line concepts for his view of the univers e and his place in it. Som e claim these to be objective, but that is vanity, or fanatic ism . From this foundation arises the person’s hierarchy of values. It doesn’t m atter if pe ople don’t understand the “m echanics” of this process—m ost of them don’t—but this is prec isely how it w orks, and it is as unavoidable as the laws of physics. So it becom es quite clear that the “R ight ” in this equation is d eterm ined by the desires of each of the hum an particip ants.

They also can see how much we love our lives, and so they want to take that away from us, using whatever m eans they have. In the past, this hatred was em power ed by the alliance of the state with organized Christianity. The two worked m ailed- fist-in -velv et-glov e as ec cles iastica l and secula r authorities cooperated to crus h those of a Dionysian caste. Th e life-haters sought out any who had that spark burning br ightly within, and in the e nd the vital ones were often tortured and murdered.

Who won?

Today you m ight ask: “How have things changed? ” The answer, gentle Satanist, is tha t the m eans ar e dif ferent, bu t th e m otivation is the s ame and still pe rvasive. The institutional church has now been severed from the state, and it m ay no longer confiscate property and execute tho se it d eem s as here tical. But the Christia n-by-na ture is s till in the majority today, and they cling together as a dull and brooding herd, re ady to lash out at any who evince the Black Flam e’s lambent spark . Observe our High Schools, particularly the public ones. I di d. I survived the incarceration called “education” and can comm ent upon it first-hand as could any anthropologist analyzing a barbican horde unde r his observation. Most of the students are dull and insipid. They seek to fit in w ith th eir p eers, to obtain a place of so me sort of hierarchy. T hey find certain types who ri se abov e them : bullies who can physically intim idate th em and students who co me from wealthy f amilie s who socially intim idate them . These are their icons, their leaders— those whom they fear, upon whom they attend with m etaphorical bended-knee, often with a sneer em blazoned on their lips, or the rictus of terror. But our herd is not com plete. They need another ingred ient. The m ediocre majority can not abide b eing the lowest in their pecking order, though they accept their place as not being top of the food chain. They must also create a caste of untouchables who will be their scapeg oats. They n eed som eone to be a v isible “bottom of the barre l” that they m ay safely deride. These will be the students who everyone picks on, who are universa lly despised, an d it is cle ar who they will be : the on es who are “ not lik e m ost.” The Christia n types can lite rally sm ell the d ifference. They mark those who are creative, who are studious. They brand those w ho do not share their values of slacking off or joining in on team sports. They condemn those who are m ore perceptive, an extent that it appears like m agic. These outsiders do not gran t the herd’s icons sove reignty, so they are seditious to the accep ted order. They are lead by their m uses, and hum an i cons who have achieved what they adm ire. Fear is not part of their equation, and their sm iles are born of delight, not contem pt or terror. And it has ever been thus. The Chris tian types engage their deeply woven xenophobia to allow them selves to see these others as “not part of their tribe,” and so not to be granted the status of being hum an by their definition. Mo st certainly they are denied any shred of em pathy, and we know that they Ch ristian type is capab le of so little, if any. The Jesus-loving m ob always correctly iden tifies those who are like you, dear Satanist, and they will do all they can to quench your spark. They always have. R eme mb er. Colum bine is a case in point. In this upscale Colorado high school, violence erupted which was shocking—to som e people. Two students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, brought weapons and bom bs to their sc hool and began to exterm inate students and teachers. When the s ituation ended, the shoc ked world focused its attention and it was discovered this deadly duo were the bright kids. They were more skilled with copie rs than anyone else in the school, and were even consulted by the faculty f or their knowledge. They wrote poetry. They listen to music that was not the kind chosen by the majority of their peers. T hey dressed differe ntly. They were clearly not “of the body” and "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"were apparently m arked by the other students fo r ostracism and the usua l social crue lty so ram pant a mongst the fledgling herd that is commonplace in the fetid rook eries known as schools. But here there seem s to have been a difference. Klebol d and Harris were inte llig ent, b ut som ething drove the m to seek de sperate re compense f or som ething uncommonly painful to them . W e may neve r know the truth re garding the actual motivations of these two killers, but it is conceivable that this school would be like so many others and supplies a context that provides a plausi ble explanation. They m ay have been tortured at the ha nds of the jocks, cheerleaders, and the common herd-spawn whose enshrined heroes gave them the needed approval for their daily perform ance of “h assle the nerds.” As is ty pical, th e mediocre want to be elevated in the eyes of their social “gods,” so bully ing the outcasts becom es a sort of “sacrifice” by which they hope to earn the favor of thei r capricious and m ediocre idols. That m ay have been th e case here. If it was, these “sacrifi cial lam s” refused to be lead to the altar of holocaus ts. Klebold and Harris c ame from families with m oney, so they h ad the wherewithal to purchase firearm s and ammun ition, as well as the m aterials needed for explosive devices—which they were sm art enough to know how to construct, and, as everyone later discovered, to deploy. So it l ooks as though the aliena ted struck back at their oppressors, a lesson that history has taugh t us is often the consequence when such situa tions ar ise. One thing might have helped defuse the situation: Satanism . If Klebold and Harris had understood Satanism and chosen to live by it, their vengeance spree would not have happened. Satanism would have taught them th at, indeed, they were not like these others, and that such a positive attribute. Satanism woul d have taught them that they had only one life, and that their intel ligence and talent would take them along paths which would lead to their drinking deeply from tha t cup which is offered by once. They would have known that Satanists practice Lex Talionis , m aking the punishm ent fit in kind and degree the crim e. W ith their superior intelligence , they should have been able to respond to taunting with verbal wit, and m ake responsible adm inistrators aware of their pain. T hey would see that the herd cannot help their na ture, and that the hum an who really flows with Nature learns to walk nim bly betw een these ponderous golem s, to snatch the bounties that the du llard s will nev er even see. Th e Satanist finds a way to prevent the torture, and m eans to be free to prosper, as living well is tru ly the best revenge. If these two had a Satanist’s perspective, they would not have seen the tran sitory period of High School as being such an insurm ountable burde n, and they would not have been com pelled to comm it heinous acts ag ainst innocent victim s. Instead, they saw no way out, and thus m ade their last stand, and perhaps did so as a gesture for those they thought to be like themselves. They are now icons for the alien ated, an d an exam ple that sets u p an Is-To-B e that d esperate oth ers m ay follow. Satanism can stop it. S atanism sees the f utility of m artyrdom , as what is it becom ing a sym bol while losing your own life? To the Satani st, his own life is the m ost precious. Let fools die and becom e symbols. Self-immolati on is “herd think,” Ch ristian lif e’s b lood — the essen ce of their creed. And so in this s iege, they essentia lly finally adopted the herd’s prem ise that one’s own life can and should be thrown away. Who won at Colum bine? The herd did.

Re member their faces, their righteousn ess. They absolved th em selves of any guilt, and saw their world- view glorified. They will always continue on this path, as they are convinced that the killing was the fault of those outsid ers alone, wh o em bodied ultim ate Evil by their difference to the m undane crowd. The possibility that the two killers might have felt that this was their only m eans for fighting oppr ession was dism issed. Satanists do not condone these acts, but we aren’t so naïve as to be unaware of their possible causes. I watched Revela tions : Paradise Lo st 2 , the second docum entary presented by HBO about Da mien Echols and the other two boys who have com e to be called “The West Mem phis Three. ” It is a v ery ed ucation al piece concerning sm all town m entality, quite worth seeing. The following discussion is based upon data presented in this film. You m ay recall the case. Thr ee young children were m urdered in a m anner that was savage beyo nd descrip tion. They were m utilated, em asculated, bitten, an d two of the three were finally drowned, naked, in a w ooded area. Since the m urdered children had been killed in such an abundantly brutal manner, the “good Christian people” cried out for justice, for blood to be spilled to m ake right this dastardly act . And Satanists would agree that su ch just v engeance was called for. Bu t the local d enizens d idn’t seem particula rly inte rested in finding out who actually did it, which would be the way to dispatch Satanic justice. Inst ead, they sought and found a quick fix to their distress, in tim e-honored lynch m ob trad ition. Enter Dam ian Echols and pals. He a nd his friends were the town oddballs. Da mian dabbled in W icca, and was charism atic enough to have Jason Baldwin as a friend and Jessie Misskelley Jr. as a follo wer. Neither of his com panions was as bright as he, with Missk elley actually having an IQ of only 72. Because th ey at tim es wore black clothing and nail polish, the local yokels though t that they must be devil worshippers. Dam ian was rathe r ef fete, so this add ed a whif f of possible ho mosexuality to the m ix. Thereby cam e the reason for their guilt: th e crim es were so horrendous, that the only explanation which the townsfolk could see wa s that Satan had to have inspired these obvious deviants to kill their ow n precious, non-deviant children. The police arrested the boys and sepa rated them . Misskelley was browbeaten by officers for 12 hours straight, after which he cl um sily confessed to wh at they wanted him to, adm ittin g not only to having witnessed the c rim e but f inally to h ave been a par ticipant. The officers only taped the last 45 minutes of this interrogation, once Misskelley was saying what they wanted him to say. He recanted the confession soon afterwards. The trial was a mockery, an d in its cour se it d emonstra ted tha t th e polic e wor k was, at the very least, inept. Leads were not foll owed up, since nobody even thought for a m inute that the tow n weirdos might be innocent—th ey were considered guilty f rom the get go. Police ignored the highly anom alous fact that there was alm ost no blood at this “m urder site,” a certain indication that the wounding had been done elsewhere. This would m ean that the killers would have needed to bring the bodies som e distance through rough terrain to the place where they were f ound—a ve ry difficult task. This im portan t fact was ignored and never investigated. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" And so, with victim s chosen to appease their lust for vengeance, the m ob failed to look elsewhere for suspects. According to th e film there is one am ongst them who looks like he ’s pos sibly th e re al culp rit— the stepf ather of one of the m urdered children. John Mark Byers claim s to be a devout Christian. And like m any of those, he w as previously a drug addict and a crim inal. He m arried a heroin addict who already had a son, Christopher Byers—one of the boys who was killed. He is six feet eight inch es tall, and has a long h istory of m ental illn ess for whic h he is prescribed num erous psychoactive pharm aceuticals. He has a brain tum or. These details are p resented as facts by the film . And when one watches his behavior on the scre en, he appears to be a conniving m onster. Attention turned briefly to him during the trail, b ut his own k nife which was covered with blood wasn’t properly teste d, so the blood couldn’t be conclusively identified. Thus possible evidence w as lost in the process of inexpert analysis. Could three children, hardly m uch bigger than the dead boys, have transported on their bicycles through rough woods one dead and bleeding child and two who were mutilated an d still alive? Unlikely. A large and st rong adult is the likelier perpetrato r. The Christian giant Byers seem s far m ore plaus ible. Ultim ately, no reasons were given during the tr ial a s to why the th ree ac cused would have been m otivated to do these m urders, except f or th eir a lleg ed interes t in Satanism . The prosecutor spoke of how religion had been used for centuries to kill others—and he m eant sacrifice, like the Aztecs and Druids had practi ced. He failed to see the iron of his argum ent in that his own Christia nity should have been added to that list of guilty f oreb ears. So f ey Dam ien was branded a Satanist, a de viant, and th us no other f acts were needed by these people to justif y his cr im e. This wa s m ore than enough for the blood-m addened rabble. Their anger and grie f served to give them tunnel vision. As seen in the docum entary, what is trul y chilling about Byers is that he appears very calculating. Every word has the feel of being spoken “on stage, ” and the filmm akers docum ent his contradictions, and m ore dam ningly, his own ritual wherein he goes to the site where the bodies were found and sym boli cally buries, then immolates in effigy, the three incarcerated boys. Did anyone ever have any evidence of ritualistic behavior on the part of the accused? No. Did our m alignant fa ther display this behavior? In spades—and on cam era. So three apparent innocents are in jail , one waiting for his death sentence to be carried out, because they weren’t lik e all of th e o thers in their insular sm all town. They dared to be different, and oh how they have paid: two have life se ntences in prisons, while Dam ian awaits th e car rying-o ut of hi s death sentence, and is regularly raped on death row. It looks like a Christian murderer is left to sing hymns and curse those who don’t believ e in Jesus as devil worsh ippers who will go to H ell. There is som e choice footage of Byers doing precisely this. That, my stunned reader, is what happens in a Christian community in the state of Arkansas. L et that be a warning. Satanism again could have been of a ssistance in this case, since our philosophy teache s us to tole rate d iffering practic es and not to pillo ry ind ividuals who se tas tes and beliefs are not ours. A Satanic investigator would not have jumped to conclusions concern ing the guilt of suspects, bu t would have dilig ently as sem bled evidence and exam ined all likely possibili ties. Rational investigation, as well as prosecution, would have been the Satanic approach. Sim ply sa ting the local desire for closure by laying blam e on unlikely suspects woul d not have been the result. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" In the unlikely event that there young m en are released and B yers is brought to trial, a savvy prosecutor would have a unique opportunity: to use Christia nity as the motivating f actor behind these killings. Is not the essential image in Christianity the im age of a s on being tortured to death as a result of his father’s will? If a disturbed individual w as deeply obsessed with this iconography, m ight he be tem pted to em ulate his Most High? “W hat Would Jehovah Do? ” The herd felt that point to deviance and the Devil was all the reason needed to g ive m ean ing to these appallingly horrific m urders, but it is poss ible that it is their own God who is the ultim ate inspiration for this tragedy. Jahweh could have been the inspirer of these deeds, having been “m ade fl esh” by a disciple acting as his hand out of “Christian love and justice.” Who won in W est Memphis? They di d yet again, m y now agita ted re ader. The herd singled out the aliens, who we re too inn ocent to rea lize th at th eir outsider status was m ore than enoug h to in cite k illing b loodlust against them . And what of the devout Christian who, like Abraham , may have brought his own lam b to the slaughter? He seem s to have escaped th e law. The film implicates Byers via circum stantial evid ence, and I th ink it show s a scenario for w hat happened that m akes more sense than the judicially determ ined one . At the very least it casts reasonable doubt on the accu sations again st the three young m en, which should have brou ght a “not g uilty ” verdict. Perhaps there are enough people from beyond that town who have chosen the label of “outsider,” who will a lso see it and may motivate the ir kind to pu t a stop to th is traves ty of justic e? I’m not holding my breath. From West Mem phis to Colum bine, we’ve seen what can happen to those outsiders who don’t have the Sata nic perspective. They m ay be lead to desperate acts or are sim ply slaughtered to a ppease the fears of the m asses. And people say there is no hum an sacrifice today, or they try to say tha t it is som ething we Satanis ts practice— what rubbish! So, m ost cherished Satanist, you m ight fi nally ask, “Are we anti-Christian? ” And I answer, “We are indeed.” W e hate their creed and all that it spawns from the very depths of our hearts and m inds. They are we lcom e to this nauseating belief system , so long as they keep it am ongst them selves. It is they wh o seek to de stroy our k ind. It is they who will bl ame us f or their own hideous actions. It is they who love deat h and torture, who believe in and practice sacrifice, an d it is they who scor n the preciousness of life itself. As I see it, if the face of their God ha s been incarnated in hu man for m, it would resem ble the face of John Mark Byers. W atch the film and look into his m ad visage, the possible slaughterer of his own son, and of ot her’s sons. That im age is the God of the Christians—for real. That is th e very essence of Christianity, and it is why we hate it with every fiber of our beings a nd see that only creatures th at are truly dam aged could em brace a faith th at has s uch absolu te v ileness at its cen tral ch erished p aradigm .

The m echanism of local pol itics is em ployed on the b asis of what will bring the m ost personal benef its to th e Satanist an d the pe ople and goals he cherishes. Those outside the Church of Satan have, from its inception, accused it of all manner of politics: communis m, fas cism , anarchism , liberalism , conservatism —and just about anything else you can think of, all of whic h are m utually exclusive. What IS clear, is that journalists who have an “axe to grin d” ag ainst the Ch urch of Satan have always accused it of advocating a political sy stem which is one they p ersonally ab hor—thus casting the Church of Satan in the role of “d evil” for them in whatever arena of human thought they wish to explore. In the 1960’s the rad ical left preached a philosop hy of “peace and love” w hich really boiled down to the concept of le veling everything to being “equal.” This “philosophy” cham pioned the abandoning of ra tional criteria f or eval uation of anything, and the em bracing of everything as being of e qual value, thus fostering m ediocrity on every level of hum an endeavor. W e are still livin g in the f allo ut of this m ode of thinking, as the people who espoused these ideas when young have grown to adulthood and are now the “establishm ent”—those adults whom th ey considered to be the enem y during the sixties. This “egalitarian ism ” was m anifested in c ultur al dom ains with con cepts such a s “Anything can be defined as being art and all such works m ust be considered to have equal validity.” Thus, som e random splashes on a canvas were considered an equal achievem ent to the Sis tin e Chapel; a mud hut was held up as being equivalent to Versailles. A janitor was dubbed the equivale nt to a physicist; a novelist was now the peer of one who scrawle d graf fiti on a bathroom wall.

Af ter all, it was the mid-sixties, twenty yea rs af ter the ending of a war that m ost of these folks weren’t even alive to have experienced. How quick ly past orthodoxies are forgotten. The Church of Satan was created in 1966 and stood in contradistinction to these ideas, which were generally defined as being “liberal.” From the tim e of the very foundation of the organization, Anton LaVey and the m embers of the Church of Satan were appalled at th is ideology which preach ed th at any kind of m erit was illuso ry—and "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"thus that the act of evaluation was an “evil ” practice.

There w as no “appeal to authority” in Satanism since e ach person held the re sponsibility for being his own authority. For this reason, we were then called “fascists” and “Nazis”—NOT because of any advocacy of the socio politic al end s of these historical m ovem ents. The m asses today still don’t know what th e term s “Nazi” and fascist” really m ean in their original sense. T hese words are now used as epithets against anyone with whom they don’t agree.

W e jokingly say that th is re ally stands for “Hitle r” not “Histo ry” as m uch of their programm ing concerns anal ysis of the Third Reich.

Is this advocating political fascism? No, of course not. Fascism is a doctr ine tha t requ ires th e subm ission of individuals to the goals of the state.

W e Satanists thin k that if one were to app ly Nature’s princ iples to a socie ty, in this con text stra tifica tio n would the n be the con cept th at one ’s merit, evidenced by dev eloped talen t and productivity, decid es one’s pos ition in society. That position could change, depending upon the shifting m atrix of societal values for your abilities. Individuality is thus cham pioned, and there will be a flux in class status rathe r than a n im posed stasis c reating a f rozen hierarchy of hereditary aristocrats. This was not the goal of the Germ an fasc ists of th e Third Re ich. Their standards were racist. They sought political power a nd needed a scapegoat for the econom ic woes of m any people. They chose the Jews, since many were econom ically successful as well as skilled arts practitioners, econom ically su cce ssf ul as well as skill ed arts practitioners, and Nazi propagandists galvanized much of the populace into following them through hatred of people they branded seditious m ons ters. They also targeted Communists, whom they felt were enem ies to their system of National Socialism . Once the Nazis took pow er, their first order of business was to impris on political enem ies, m any of whom were Communists. These were the people first inca rcerated in concentration camps. However, the need to continue identif ying enem ies, denigrated groups of people so that the “Aryans” could feel superior, lead to the im prison ment a nd exterm ination of the Jews, along with gypsies and even hom ose xuals, de spite the hom ophile proclivities of som e leading Nazis. They too were purged . “Decaden t” was the s mear used against them while the Nazis as sum ed the mantle of m oral and aesthetic purity. When fascist doctrine is placed into pract ice, reg ardles s of where or when, there has to be som ebody who tells the herd what the needs of THE STATE ar e to be, since THE STATE is just an a bstrac tion— it does no t actually exist. Here ente rs the “Ruling Class,” otherwise known as the Nazi Party, the Communist Party, the Khm er Rouge, and so on. These rulers claim to em body THE STAT E, telling the m asses what the will of THE STATE is. They reign m uch like the an cient priesthoods who held their power by being the on ly ones cap able of communicating to people th e “ will of the G ods.” These people are a de facto aristocracy, using THE STATE for its raison d’être, just as the latter-day heads of som e of the communi st states handed down THE W ILL OF THE PEOPLE as their excuse for controlling thei r m assed subjects. These rulers are not subject to sacrificing them selves to THE STATE, because they are th e on es who, as em bodi ments of THE STATE, choose who is to be sacrificed. They don’t pick them selves, though sometim es they do pick th eir cohorts wh o are getting a bit too co cky. These kinds of rulers now use term s more palatable to our cent ury, whose m asses won’t buy such old excuses as “the divine right of kings,” but their m eans are identical. Of course, these rulers are often foiled by subsequent “pr ophets,” who convince the m asses that they, rather than the current rulers, em body THE STATE, and so counter-revolutions occur and th e for mer leaders are us ually d ispatch ed with vio lence.

But Toto (the beast) pulled aside the curtain. Now we m ight begin to see how Satanists factor in to this equation. The Satanist should always be aware of who is really running the situation in which he finds him self. The clever know the ropes of the system in which they live and use that to their advantage. Satanists do not s ee them selves as being part of the herd and naturally resist any attempts to be forced to live under any regim es that would m ake them part of the controlled m asses. However, Sa tanists m ight not care how the herd is being controlled, so long as they them selves aren’t subject to being controlled along with them. If forced by circum stance to be part of su ch a governm ental situation (and I caution the reader to exam ine how much he really know s about the m achinations of his current nation of residence), the clever Satanist would either attem pt to be the person who pulls the strings, or, m ore likely, hi s associate.

If one is not a m ember of the ruling class, but is actually part of a m inority faction in a pluralistic society, then advocating that “everyone be treated equally under the law” may guarantee that you will have a m aximum a mount of personal freed om. Be aware of mitigating “power factors” at work— like wealth. Of course the am ount of freedom depends upon the laws of the society in whic h one lives and we recognize that special interest groups often jostle to get m ore of the “pie” through handouts and privileges estab lished via state m echanism s. Satanists know that there are no natural rights as the concepts of rights requires som eone or som ething to be doling them out, an d in the pa st this was usu ally con side red to be som e God. The only rights one has are those given by the laws of the governmental structure un der which y ou live, and ultim ately, even these d evolve in to what you m ay attain for yourself using wh atever personal power you m ight have. That is why the rich get away with so m uch more, as their m oney gives them power and hence, m ore rights in a society ruled by lawyers and not justice. However, if you belonged to the ruling class you m ight have a very different perspec tive. It is tru e tha t self -iden tified Sa tanists are cu rren tly a m inority in a plura listic society. But what if they achieved a position of being the ruling clas s? How would clever self-declared Satanists run a governm ent? W hat would they advocate? How would they control the m asses? This could be a fine ques tion that could be deal t with in a novel of speculative f iction, as it is not likely to happe n in reality. But, we do know that the people who really understand how to exercise power on the highest of hu man levels, regardless of whatever philosophy they proclaim as their cover, are actually m aintaining their power by behaving in acco rdan ce with th e true natu re of the hum an species, and are thus de facto Satanists. So, som e Satanists who are “political id ealists” m ight envision a fascistic future wherein Satanists are the “m en behind the curt ain” directing the herd to support their own personal indulgences—the herd sacrificing them selves to a ruling, but necessarily hidden, Satanic “elite.” I see this as a political pipedream , a for m of idealism incompatible with the essential pragm atism of Satanism.

A groundswell of ci vil disobedience is afoot wherein couples of the sam e gender are being wed by various gov ernm ent offi cials as a tes t of existing laws. The Christian right cons iders this to be an abom ination, and they continually attem pt, on state and national levels, to legisl ate that m arriage should be defined solely as a union between one male and one fe male partner. Politicians have used this as a dividing issue, som e even painting suppor ters of legalized sam e-sex unions as agents of Satanic immorality. So, since we are a legally incor porated church, m any have a sked “W here do Satanists stand on this m atter? ” The Church of Satan does not determine th e politics of its m embership. However, there are basic tenets shared by our adhere nts and so we Satanists generally agree on certain political points relating to the advancem ent of individual libert y. It is an in trinsic part of our philosophy as expressed in The Satanic Bible to accept a broad range of hum an sexual practice—so long as it is betwee n consenting adults. The Church of Satan is the best organized religious group to fully accept m embers regardless of sexual orientation and thus our m emb ers advocate that any existing laws discrim inating against hom osexuality should be revoked. It natura lly follows that Satanists would support weddings or civil unions between adult partners wh ether they be of opposite or the sam e sex. So long as love is pres ent and th e partn ers w ish to commit to a re latio nship, we endorse their desire for a lega lly recognized partnership, and th e rights and privileges that com e from such a union.

Such a diabolical individual m ight say, “W ell, good for you for having been privileged to be with a proven crea tive person whom I adm ire, but now where m ight I find your grea t works? ” The GEH then reaches into his drawer and pulls forth som e sa dly mediocre m akings and presents them with a flourish to the questioner, em phasizing that the m aster has praised h is ef forts. The ex pectation is that he too will be lauded as a p eer of the acknowledged m aster. However, when the m eritocrat’s resp onse does not present the level of praise so desperately sought and though to be his due by the GEH, it is now tim e for the ham ster to revile him , and claim he lacks taste or exper tise. The m eritocrat then begins to wonder if the m aster him self m ight have lacked judgm ent when having allowed the ham ster to be an associate. Of course, the relation ship with the m aster m ay never really have been all that the GEH claim s it was, but the m aster is not privy to these ham sterly cam paigns and thus cannot say to the meritocrat, with a wi nk and a nudge, that he was “only being nice.” In the Church of Satan we have a policy of rejecting the practice of noblesse oblige (literally “nobility obliges”) . This is a m edieval concep t in which the upper classes (wealthy or highborn folks) were considered bound towards assisting the lower classes because of their elevated status. In the C hurch of Satan, our stratification is based on merit, hence our “nobles” are su ch b ecause of the developm ent of their creativ e skills. On my very first m eeting with Dr. LaVey, he said to my wife and I that the C hurch did not support the idea that the talented creators we re required to assist the weaker wannabes who were also m embers. This was because at the tim e a f ar less-ta len ted m ember was trying to use the comm onality of m embership as a reason to gain y assistance in her own rather lack-luster m usical projects. A nd so, pleased by such a rational and just policy, I politely disengaged m yself for m the clingy m ember, who then ran off to try and find other m usical m embers to he lp realize her “v isio n.” If you are a creator, either a recognized m aster in your field or even a talented newcom er on the rise, beware of the Green-E yed Ham ster. They seem like such little things, and you have such an abundance of ab ility that you’ll think, “W hat can it hurt to be char itab le to th is ta lent-cha lleng ed person ?” However, the tim e will c ome when the ham ster dem ands more than he des erves, and y ou will be fo rced to d isen gage yourself with grace, but your gifts of m ild praise will now be used against you. Th e GEH will cling with his nasty little teeth to your reputation, and t hose w ho adm ire you will perh aps even question your judgm ent for eve r having been kind to the now vituperative ham ster. So, dear doers, recognize those Green -Eyed Ham ster. W hen these wannabes com e-a-calling, either refuse to comm ent on their efforts, or be brutally honest.

Satanist can find several arti stic “isms” to be su itable pa th s f or a Satan ic artist, and naturally these can be m ixed according to the unique tastes of each creator. Th is is not an exhaustive survey, but m erely intended to give pointers for further research to enhance your understanding of a broad range of possibilities. Realism : Since our philosophy em braces an “un varnished ” look at the reality of our hum an existence, this form of expression in literature, narrative, and visual arts is obviously sound practice for any Satanist artist. Naturalism : In so far as this is a m eans for explor ing truths about natu re, it is certainly a Satanic approach. The Naturalists in visual arts were influenced by Darwinian ideas and saw Nature as the dom inant f orce. Litera ry proponents didn’t flinch from what others might consider vulgarity. Scientific concepts supported aesthetic choice s for artists in this school. Romanticis m: In a rt an d litera ture, this is a means for creating highly personalized system s of s ymbols and subjective w orlds of heightened em otions. Supernatural elem ents are often em ployed because of their em otiona l impact. The heroism of the individual is celeb rated in this f orm that was inf luenced by concepts of freedom arising in the French Revolution. Expressionism: Par ticu larly in its ap plica tion to horror f ilm s and film noir , this is a method for depicting a dark and hostile world, full of struggle. The earliest works w ere wildly unrealistic and m eant to explore the psychology of m adness through use of geom etrically harsh sets and grotesque m akeup. Am erican crim e fil ms de fined the world from a cynical, fatalistic perspective, with the ou tcom e of the dram a often being harsh, though at tim es the struggle for integrity m ight pay off, but only after sufficient angst is experienced. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" Idealis m: Satanists adopt a pragm atic view concer ning their inte ractions with the wor ld, hence “pie in the sky” idealism is unsu itab le. Th e “best of all possible wo rlds” philosophy so diabolically m ocked by Voltaire in his Candide is not one that is em braced by Satanists, who are anythi ng but starry-eyed. However, Satanists know that, both socia lly and politica lly, the nation s in which th ey exist are a rtificial con structs, jus t as are the jus tice s ystem s which are in effect in them , so a Satanic ar tist would feel free to create artworks which depict the im plementation of principles which he him self would prefer to see enacted in the actions of his fellow hum ans. This can be dram atized in an idealis tic projec tion in which Sata nic jus tice is carr ied out in ways not currently probable. An excellent way of exploring various idealisti c depictions is through fantasy, both of the “scien ce fiction” type, as well as in historical or fantastic reimaginings of past societies. These can be projections of an Is-To-Be, a nd creations of this sort have m agically becom e, in som e instances, self-fulfilling prophecies. Surrealis m: This school of artis tic creation was m ean t initially as a way to explore d ark regions of the hum an consciousness, juxt aposing seem ingly incongruous im ages or concepts so that, through dynam ic synthesis, a greater understanding could be reached of the psychology of the hum an ani mal. Since Sa tanism is concerned with ever-deepening its grasp of the functions of the m ind and hum an behavior, this genre can provide a potent method for c ontinuing to define th e nature of the hum an beast. Since Satanism cherishes individualism as one of its prim ary values, the aesthetically inclined Satanist would genera lly ap preciate any artist’s work that s trong ly captured the individual personality of that artist. T hat doe s not m ean that this work is going to be selected to be am ongst “favorite” or ever “p referred” artistic expe riences. Uniqueness and originality are but two standard s for artistic evaluation. Satani st tend to define their true favorites as being created by uni que artists who p resent a worl d-view which shares som e congruity with that of the appr eciator, or which so powerfully depict a world-view that is not congruent, but is deeply affecting on an em otional and or intellectual level to the Satanist experiencing that wo rk. The Satanist I’ve known ha ve always been very picky about whatever artistic creation on which th ey choose to spend th eir precious tim e.

I here present profiles of several m ajor com posers whose work I find to be deeply rewarding. They are wo rthy of your attention. Ludw ig van Beethoven (1770-1827): Musical Titan Despite the prevailing cultural illiteracy, is there anyone out there who hasn’t heard the nam e of the m ighty Beethoven? And who is not fam iliar with the fam ous four-note motive—three shorts and a long—that begin his incom parable Fifth Symphony? (W ho still recalls what that sy mbo lized in Morse code during W orld W ar II?) Yet how m any of you have taken the tim e to explore the work s of one of the tita ns of m usic, whose com positions com bine emotional he ights and f ormal brillian ce at a level that f ew have approached ? Beethoven was the prototype of the m averick composer, who told his patrons what he wanted to do, rather than vice vers a (unlike Mozart, who en joyed his life but was constantly having to do what his patrons wa nted). The youthful Beethoven was hailed by Mozart as o ne who would m ake a stir in the world. Beethoven was thus accepted into aristocratic circles and was supported by wealthy m usic fancie rs who tolerated his gruff manner and often unkempt appearance. In 1798 h e becam e aware of a progressiv e lo ss of hearing and finally becam e completely deaf by 1819. Despite this tragic handicap, he continued to produce works that expanded west ern m usic to new heights of achievem ent and he m aintained his love of existence th rough all of these, choos ing to celebrate the forces of life in the face of his own tragedy. The dark current flowed through his bein g so strong that he could continue despite the extinguishing of his sense to perceive the results of his efforts. The sound world that existe d in his im agination went directly down on paper, for perform ers to later recreate so that we can share Beethoven’s m usical visions. Beethoven turned his efforts to just about every genre of m usic that was extant in his tim e, transfor ming and expandin g each of them , from cham ber m usic and art son gs to concerti, large scale vocal works and sym phonies . The em otional hallm ark to be found in all of these is a heroic sense of struggle and victory, the persona l “I” m aking a direct assault on th e univers e and bending things to its will. Thoug h Beethoven did write works on Christian texts, his Miss Solemnis being a prim e exa mple, he generally seem ed to be more attracted to works by Schiller and Goethe for inspiratio n, as well as Greek mythologica l ta les. It is perhaps best to start one’s e xploration of Beethoven’s m usic with his sym phonies. His Third S ymphony, subtitled Eroica , was originally dedicated to "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Napoleon. He failed to live up to Beethoven’s concepts of what an enlightened leader should acco mplish, so h is nam e was rem oved fr om the dedication p age. This sym phony am azed audiences at the tim e for being about half again as lo ng as any previous work in his genre. B ut Beethoven need this enlarged tim e-scale to explore his concept of the hero, who is carried to the grave in the funeral m arch of the second move ment. His Fourth S ymphony was on a sm aller scal e, but with Sym phony #5 he achieved a m asterpiece. It details in an am azingly co mpact way the struggle through the victory, and every m ovem ent, from the driven first th rough to the soaringly trium phant finale em erging from a shadowy transition, is based on the opening m otto. Symphony #6, Pastoral , revels in a purely pagan appreciation of nature with Beethoven creating im ages of brooks, bird-calls, a rainstorm , and a peas ant wedding, but really de picting the glorious em otions he felt by reflecting on the beauty of nature culm inating in the final move ment’s hym n to nature. Sym phony #7 in tensely exam ines rhythm , concluding with a Dionysian dance. Symphony #8 is com pact a nd full of wit and hum or. The renowned Ninth Sym phony is his largest. The first m ovem ent was unlike anything written before, being colossal in sound. The sc herzo is fugal and developed in sonata fashion, and its move ment is like the dancing of infernal flam es. The lyrical adagio prov ides a sooth ing respite before the expanded finale. For the first tim e, this concluding m ovem ent included a chorus and vocal so lois ts in a celeb ration based on the never to be forgotten “Ode to Joy.” I suggest that you seek out the record ings by John Eliot Gardiner and the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Rom antic, as he uses Beethoven’s tem po m arkings and the ensem ble of origin al in stru ments preserves the proper or chestral balance m aking the detailed pa rt-writing cry stal clea r.

Anton Bruc kner (1824-1896): Naïve Sophisticate He taught Mahler and is renow ned as a Rom an Catholic com poser. Considered a social misfit and often viewed as a “country bu mpkin,” Bruckner becam e a sorcerer when im provising at the pipe organ or when co mposing his m assive, contrapuntally com plex sym phonies. His focus was on the power he unders tood to be the source of the universe, not on Jesus as a savior. Hi s sym phonies are powerfully m onum ental, with prom inent brass writing in organ-like sonority. The quali ties m ost often felt in his work are nobility and m ajesty. Try Sym phony #4 to start, called The Romantic . If you find it inspiring, go on to #5, #7, #8, and #9. Bruckner’s style doe sn’t change, but his expertise and com plexity increase over the course of hi s com pos itions. Herbert von Karajan is an excellent interpre ter, bu t Kurt Eichh orn and Günter W and also do splendidly. Gustav Ma hler (1860-1911): Urbane Visionary He com posed one of the most dram atic and com plex series of sym phonies ever conceived—they are m y favorites. Nine were completed, while the Tenth was unfinished at the tim e of his death b ut there are com pletions by m usicologists and they are excellent. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The song cycle sym phony Das Lied von der Erde preceded h is Ninth Sym phony and Mahler him self saw it as an unnum bered sy mphony. As a student he was passionately interested in Nietzsch e and adored Wagner, a nd his m ajor life career was as one of the world’s leading conductors, celebrated for hi s detailed interpreta tions of Wagner and Mozart. His work grows progressively m ore com plex over the course of his career, so it is often well to start with his Sym phony #1. It e vokes nature in the first m ovem ent, has an earthy p easant dance for a scherzo, a mocking funeral m arch for the slow move ment and an apocalyptic/trium phant fina le. His Sym phony #2 is subtitled Resurrectio n but it isn’t what one would expect from the Christian po int of view. Mahler intended it to sym bolize his own artistic trium ph over negative critical re sponse and it takes the paradigm of Beethoven’s Ninth to even greater lengths a nd depths. His Third Sym phony is his longest and it em bodies Mahler’s love of raw, pagan nature. The first m ove ment is gigantic and pictures the awakening of Pan and the vol canic paroxysm s of life’s struggle. The following five m ove ments take one on an evol utionary journey thr ough several worlds, of plant life, of anim als, of l oneliness—a setting of a Nietzsch e text, of naïve religion, and finally of deep hum an pa ssion. The m iddle group of purely orchestral sym phonies is com plex and exciting. The Fifth begins with a funeral m arch and finally ends in raucous trium ph, based on a m elody he wrote for a song that lam pooned people with unsophisticated tastes. The tragic Sixth Sym phony is one of the darkest pieces ever written, ending with a vast move ment interrupted by actual sledgehamm er blows, shattering the sy mbolic hero of the piece. The Seventh is som etim es called the “song of th e night,” and it evokes the night in m any guises. His Eighth is anot her vast choral sym phony, called at the prem iere the Symphony of a Thousand because of the gigantic forces needed to perfo rm it. Mahler goes back to Bach for contrapuntal thinking and sets a text invoking th e creativ e spirit, and then moving on to a setting of the final scene of Goethe’s Faust . His Ninth, written under the specter of declining health, is a sophisticat ed leave-taking, wrench ingly despairing, then finally resignedly detached. The unfinished Te nth goes even further in its despair, but finally concludes with a cher ishing love of having lived. Hyper-em otionalism is the rule in this m usic. If you like this then keep going with the rest of the sym phonies in order, give them time and attention for it is repaid—get Leonard Bernstein’s recordings, either the old on Sony or the new on Deutsche Grammophon. Richard Strauss (1864-1949): Celebrating Himself Who could forget the thrilling opening m usic to S tanley Kubrick’s film 2001: A Space Odyssey? Who hasn’t been m oved by that sonic sunburst that Kubrick wisely used to herald the birth of conscious intelligence in Man’s ancesto rs, and underscored the first use of tools—a weapon, I m ight add? That magnificent fanfare was penned by Richard Strauss as the opening for his tone poem Thus Spake Zarathustra , which was the com poser’s effort at creating an audio equivalent to Nietzsche’s iconoclastic book. Strauss was known in his youth as a radica l m odern, shocking the critics with his voluptuous music, whether it be purely sym phonic or operatic. In his final years he was considered to be an aging reactionary, co-opt ed by the Nazis, and thus generally ignored by a world that had m oved to em brace less hum an m usic, that had los t th e ability to "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"appreciate s plendor and skill. To the modern lis tener, he appear s as an artist that created works of great beauty overflowing with the joy and struggle of life. Strauss a ctiv ely re jec ted Christianity and its d isgu sting c reed o f self -sacr ifice. He saw life as a heroic battle and him self as his own God. Thus, when he composed a tone poem called A Hero’s Life , one should not be surprised that he Satanically m ade it a self- portrait. In this, he depicts him self as a mighty life-em bracing warrior who enjoys a w ar against his critics—lam pooned as the toads that they were, and who enjoyed his sensuous pleasures to the fulles t. He again celebrated himself and his fa mily in the Domestic Symphony , a musical depiction of grandiose proporti ons that glorifies his hom e lif e with his wife and child. Though his detractors were always outraged at his self-glorifi cation, they did not stand in the way of his fam e, achieved at an early age as b oth a com poser and cond uctor. Strauss’ m astery of orchestration was s econd to none, and he created soundscapes that astonished audiences with the verisim ilitude of their tone-painting. Listen to his Don Quixote , where he uses woodwind and brass tril ls to sound like a noisy herd of sheep. The storm segm ent of hi s An Alpine Symphony is one of the most vi olen t and rea listic in all m usic literature, com plete with both a wind m achine and thunder sheet. W e’ll speak more of this piece. As a young m an, Strauss wrote Death and Transfiguration which depicts a m an’s recollections of his very full life while on his deathbed. Here he likened life to a series of even m ore m agnificent strivings after one’s goals which ar e atta ined. Death is finally heralded by an om inous tam -tam stroke, yet the heroic spirit is not stopped, but soars on to self-g lory . W hen he ultim ately lay dying, Strau ss claim ed that it was ju st as he com posed it years before. His operas o ften caused scandals b ecause Strau ss was not afraid to em brace unbridled lust in Salome or poisonous vitriol in Elektra using surprising dissonance for the tim e to accom pany lasciviousn ess and vi olen ce on stage. His later operas retreated into a m ore genteel but elaborately crafted st yle influenced b y Mozartean grace, su ch as The Knight of the Rose and Capriccio . This carnal philosophy of life permeated hi s work in all m edia, but it cam e most strongly to the fore in his m ightiest tone poem , An Alpine Symphony . Ostensibly, this piece po rtrays a journey by a m ount aineer, star ting out in prim al darkness, then greeted by another b lazing sunrise, and continuing until h e reach es th e m ountain’s summ it, experiences an apocalyp tic sto rm, and then descends to the final darkness of night. Strauss s aid that the true inten t of the piece was a repres entation of Man’s appropriate existence. H ere life is experienced as if it were a mountain to be conquered by dint of personal struggle, in heroic harm ony with th e m agnificence of Nature. He clearly defined this as being in direct opposition to the Christ ian attitude towards lif e, and indeed the first title of this p iece, which he later drop ped, was Antichr ist . You will f ind he re an utter ly Satanic em bodim ent of l ife. Fr om out of the darkness, the ri sing them e of as piration leads to a birth in trium ph, a “yea sa ying” to the challenges before one.

Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975): Honest W itness Dm itri Shostakovich was the great atheist co mposer who suffered under the tyranny of Stalin ist Rus sia, writing music that w ryly co mm ented on the totalita rian s ociety in which he lived. He found a way to produce works that could pass for the vapid “socialist realist” paeans dem anded by the governm ent, yet still voiced opposition and m ockery of the dom inant authoritarianism. He did not flee this society, but rem ained to bear witness to the suffering and bravery of the m illions who were prisoners to this grim nation. You won’t find m uch that is light in S hostakovich’s work, for when it com es ti me to be hum orous his laughter is often worked into a shriek. T rium ph com es not from the forced public celeb ratio n, but from the inti mate treasuring of the fragility of hum an tenderness, like a rare and ephem eral blossom clinging to a barren crag. He is one of the great sym phonists, com pleting 15, directly insp ired both in style and content by the m ight ten written by Gustav Mahler. He also wrote 15 string quartets, and these are as structurally dense as his sym phonies and even m ore revealing in their exploration of Shostakovich’s psychological states. There are as well f ilm scores, operas, ballets, concerti, piano works and pieces written for specific occasion s—a wealth of exquisite music that w ill take you years to fully explore. His genius is to be starkly realistic in his exploration of the context of human consciousness in a universe that is fraught with danger created by other hum ans whose goal is control and suppression of ind ividualit y. T hus his work chronicles a struggle for freedom that is dear to th e hear ts of Satanists, who m ust ofte n hide their true nature from the bigots who have the power to thr ottle the ir qu est f or th e jo ys that lif e c an of fer.

His m assive Fourth Symphony, deeply i ndebted to Mahler, carried dissonant grotesquerie to new heights. Sin ce S talin had detested his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtzensk written in a sim ilar style—and to displ ease this boss literally m eant you would be dragged away in the m iddle of the night to be exiled to die in frozen Siberia— Shostakovich withdrew this sym phony before its official prem ier and produced another one far m ore convenien tly tonal, the Fifth Sym phony, and it too had the sort of success that the First had achieved. Listen to this work, with its alm ost Beethovenian first move ment—stern and well-developed, the sc herzo a M ahleresque p eas ant dance, th e largo a darkly passionate lam ent, finished by a f inale th at wo rks itself into a m ighty peroration. Of course, those w ho understand this finale see it as a forced celebration, and conductors who knew the com poser play this so that the triumph is m ore an agonized pounding than an actual victory. His Sixth Symphony used three m ovem ents to make its point, starting with an adagio plum bing the depths of despair, infl uenced by the first m ove ment of Mahler’s 8unfinished Tenth Sym phony. Its scherzo then co ntinues in the cheeky vein so definitive of this com poser, while the finale is a vigor ous march, athletic and confident in tone. The Seventh, called The Leningrad , was written while Shostakovich was in L eningrad, under attack by the Nazis. He volunteered as a firem an to protect the city—a famous picture of him in a fire helm et was circu lated for pr opagandistic purposes. The first move ment of what is his longest sym phony depicts Russia invaded by the m echanistic Nazis, who are portray ed by a sim plistic m arch that proceed s thro ugh a series of pedantic variations, becom ing more brutal as it goes along. This m arch is developed into battle m usic that finally vanquishes the inva der. The moderato is a wood-wind-dom inated scherzo move ment with a harrowing clim ax and the adagio that follows has m uch poetry and passion. The finale m ove ment brings back the battle, reaching a truly bom bastic culm ination with the retu rn of the f irst move ment’s m ain the me. This work was supported by the Soviet governm ent and was im mediately played in the Western world as a sym bol of the Sovie t people’s stru ggle aga inst Hitle r.

The five m ovem ent Eighth Sym phony wa s also a wartim e work, but it grim ly explores the repressions of th e communist regim e, ending in a m ode that is not shouting victory, but which is m ore an appreciation of having survived a nightm are—just barely. The governm ent expected a trium phal choral Ninth, celebrating the end of the war. They got a sarcastic brief symphony that challenges the skills of the m usicians thum bs its nose at convention. Stalin finally died, and so the Tenth Sym phony is a personal work, musically referencing one of Shostakovich’s love interests and m ocking Stalin with a fierce sch erzo that end s with a scream. His Eleventh Sym phony is a vast tonal canvas often quoting Russian revolutionary songs, ostensibly depicting a Tsarist m assacre during a protest. But of course it seem s ai med at sim ilar doings by th e Soviet overlords. It is a long work, but very evocative, alm ost cinem atic in effect. The Twelfth is m uch like an “agit-p rop” film score, and it has a bom bastic finale akin to the Seventh.

Fin ally, the f ifth m ovem ent begins with Galileo and then othe r creators find ing “careers ” that m ake them cursed for being truthful while “yes-m en” lackeys often succeed o ver thes e ico noclas ts by catering to s ociety ’s ru lers. The m usic here is wistful, delicate, ironic and warm , knowing the scarceness of such bravery in the face of the inertia of collectiv e conform ity. It is a m asterpiece. The Fourteenth Sym phony was inspired by Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde and is for soprano and bass soloists, and string orchestra with percussion. It is based on collected po em s confronting de ath in m any for ms, and is thus a secular m editation on the preciousness of life by exam ining the consequences of death. The final Fifteenth Sym phony s ums up Shostakovich’s life with m usical quotations of his own and other favored composer’s works, with m uch pa rody, explosive lam entation, and finally a strange icy calm detachm ent, ending with a warm smile that fades Cheshire Cat-like into the air. There is a set of the complete sym phonies conducted by Rudolph Barshai, who prem iered the Fourteenth Sy mphony, that are exquisitely played with all the beauty, terror, and mockery required. Other outstandi ng interpreters are Mr avinsky, Rostropovich, Rozhdestvensky, Ashkenazy, and Haitink. And so, fellow non-believers, you w ill find th is music to be worth your while as it exhibits how an artist of wit and passion can resist dictatorship to speak his m ind and poignantly capture what it m eant to be a pers on o f awareness in a so ciety that destroyed so m any who refused to confor m. Leonard Be rnstein (1918-1990): Maestro of All Trades On October 14, 1990 the world of music lost not only a star but an entire constellation with the death of Leonard Bernstein, Com poser, conductor, teacher, show man, egoist, libertin e—all were facets of this extraordinarily talented m an who lived to suck the very marrow from the bones of life. He made his ow n way, developing his talents to the fullest and using his own m ind as the arbiter of his direction, resisting those who would put him off his goals from his father who opposed Lenny’ s desire to be a m usician to colleagues who wished for him to lim it his scope to one facet of m usic. He is an example of a de facto Satanist in his concen tration on enjoying the present to its fullest. As a conductor, Bernst ein was known as one of the most charism atic and Dionysian of podium personalities, havi ng won his way to a status that had previously only been available to European s. I was fortunate e nough to have witnessed several of his perform ances and can vouch for the pure ecstatic galvanism of the experience. He would com pletely identify with the com poser of the work as he conducted, "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"whipping th e orches tra into a perform ance that would be f illed with blood and fire, bringing the printed notes to life as if one we re ex perien cing the m usic for the very firs t tim e. W e are enriched b y the leg acy of record ings he m ade over the entire span of his conducting career. Indeed, everyone reading this will alm ost certainly h ave been introdu ced to som e classical m usic via one or m ore of Bernstein’s recordings. He excelled in works that gave reign to em otion on a grand scale, particularly the sym phonies of Gustav Mahler. As a conductor alone, Bernstein carved out a niche as one of the very greatest, but he also found tim e to compose original m usic as well, ranging from sym phonic works to ballet scores and Broadway m usicals. Again, I’m certain that all of you will have been touched by his com positions at som e point in your lives. He gains imm ortality from We st Side Story , and updated Romeo and Juliet set amidst rival gangs in Manhattan. This score is perm eated with the interval of the augm ented fourth, known as diabolus in musica . The milieu isn’t that im portan t, but th e res ponsive m elodies he crafted m atched the words to perfection, and shall remain pe rhaps his greatest legacy. For sheer Satanic sati re, one can turn to Candide, which tea rs apart the “B est of all possible worlds” bunk by revealing the brutality of existence, the callous monstrousness of hierarchies, both religious and governm ental , and in the end, the need to create your own m eaning through what you yourself can do. The score sparkles with musical witticism s and the libretto is equa lly wry. Bernstein had a lifelong struggle agains t the idea of faith in extern al figures. He composed pieces that constantly turned the focus for m eaning back to Man h imself. His Mass , though dated with rock-influenced elem ents, was written as a conde mnation of organized religion. One of m y favorite works is the Sym phoni c suite derived from the score to the film On The Waterfront . Here we find a truly Satanic sym phonic poem which captures the breadth of the struggle of life itself. It begins with a haunting, searching them e, then segues in to an aura l dep iction of the violenc e and bruta lity of existence. L ater we a re em braced by a sweepin gly rom antic love them e. Throughout the work, th ese ideas are developed and com bine d in a way that signifie s the struggle of existe nce, full of tragedy, but ultim ately of trium ph. The final pero ration includes a com bination of the opening search ing th em e with th e love them e, passion united with pu rpose to ach ieve the cho sen end. Life as a struggle, to stand above th e herd and derive your own ends. Truly a masterpiece. Another noteworthy asp ect of Be rnstein’s work is his depiction of New York City for its full range of m ajesty and terror. He even composed the fa mous, “Ne w York, New York, a Hell of a Town,” tune, certainly a Satanic gem . In his personal life, Bernstein didn’t stint on his enjoym ent of anything. Known for having a m ighty ego, and his talents certainly justified it, he also was reputed to be generous to his friends and l overs of either sex. H is desi re for success and the m agical events that s haped his life prove th at he knew where best to direct his energies. Yes, he certainly had his flaws which included a certain va pidity concerning socio-political issues. Here he often followed the liberal herd. His infam ous party for the Black Panthers was justly satirized by To m W olfe. But such things are m inor when com pared to the m usical legacy that rem ains. He truly lived a Sata nic existence, having flam ed and t ossed the fires about him, igni ting passions in those whom he touched. He shall rem ain immortal in the brains and sine ws of those whose respect and adm iration he has gained. Hail Leonard Bernstein! Bravissim o!

But its m agic, as always , beats in the hearts of Satanists, for we are kin and the living priesthood of its eternal m ysteries. 15 August, XXXVIII A.S. ALAS, BABYLON E VER SI NCE MY YOUTH, I visited New York City and have always been im pressed on a very deep level with how it encom passe s th e entire rang e of capabilities of the hum an animal. W hen I moved here to Hell’s Kitchen twenty-five years ago, it was the fulfillm ent of a long am bition. As a S atanist, I sav or the s tratif ication of our kind. I en joy the rich creations of rare i ndividuals and am fascinated by the depths of depravity of others. I attempt to avoid the majority of people as they ar e generally m ediocrities ad not worth any tim e or attention. W hat was refreshi ng about The City at that tim e, as opposed to upstate N ew York from whence I cam e, was the lack of moderation, with little of the dull m iddle ground to muddy the stark black and white scenery. In m y experience it has always seem ed to be the “ world city,” the cap ital and pivotal exemplar of what it m eans to be “hom o urbanus.” All extrem es of hum an types can be found here: sub-moron, genius, the sophis ticates, the naïve. Tim es Square used to be the m ost potent vista for viewing this en tire spectrum in one gl ance. If one stood on Broadway and 42 nd Street, sim ply by looking around you could see hum an passions em bodied: base sexuality in the venues fo r all facets of pornography, the restless m ind hungry for infor mation in the endless elec tronic crawl of he adlines and in the publications cramm ing the newsstands. Our n eed for fantasy was served by the m any theaters showing every level of film be ing produced and a sim ilar range of live perform ance from the splendid to the sordid. Th ere were shop s that so ld e xotic weapo nry and tacky souvenirs. The cuisine ranged from street ve ndors of dubious cleanliness and the quintessentially Am erican Howard Johnson’s to the second floor exotica of The Chinese Republic—one of the oldest Ch ines e restau ran ts in midtow n. During its final years. A visit required one to elbow aside pimps and hookers to get through the street-level door and then climb up through the dingy , graffiti- cov ered stairwell to reach th e red-lined lounge with its faded light-boxed photos of Chinese locations. Tim es Square was such a heady place to visit; it functioned in the way symbols do, allowing so m uch inform ation to be in conscious focus in one intuitive fl ash.

Like the urban Hellscape in Blade Runner , the glittering techno- orgasm ic dis plays cr eate even deepe r shadow s tha t will again be f illed with those who always call them home. Yes, our once and future Babylon is still Satanic, and those of us who know it intim ately can still find the stim ulating extrem es, sidestepping the alien throng of mall cultists. Their m oment is now, but I suspect that it shall be fleeting. T he mask will slip, and when the true vis age is glim psed, it will se nd them scurrying ba ck to the im agined norm ality of their pros aic suburb s and “heartland” states. The curren t forces of sterilization ar e different from previous attem pts to bowdlerize The City because of their prem editation and financial power, and it m ay be that the areas blighted by th em m ay rem ain under their sway for som e time. So long as there is a profitable m arket for a “Manhattanland” experien ce am ongst visitors who think that v isiting saf e sim ulacra is p refera ble to som ething m ore spicy, the se s pots will re main “im proved” and resistant to the surroundings which haven’t yet been “redeem ed.” I cannot say f or sure what m ay turn that tide , but in their greed, as soon as the incom e begins to d ecreas e, the m aintenance will lessen and things w ill b ecom e seedy, and ag ain havens for what they view as the less savory.

They used the great key of doubt to ask the questions left unasked, to travel to the lands, both physical and conceptual, which had rem ained previously unexplored, and thus forbidden to all but the bold. Anton LaVey was one of these bold anim als, complete in his understanding, and brave enough to stand before his fellows and challenge the hide-bound platitudes that bind the co mplacent masses.

He was truly a titan am ong m en, and though we are the poorer for no longer being gr aced by his personal presence, his burning ideas hav e a life of their own th at is crystallized in those w ho know that it is their W ill to continue along the trail which he blazed with such brilliance.

We list th em from our first decad e retrospective written by Anton LaVey, and printed in The Cloven Hoof , Volum e VIII, #2. The First P hase , Em ergence, cry stalli zed the ze itgeist into re ality—le t lo ose the knowledge of a Satanic body politic into a ready but dum bfounded social clim ate. The Second Phase , Developm ent, saw an organizationa l and institutional expansion as a result of carefully stim ulated exploitation at tracting a variety of hu man types from which to distill a S atanic “ideal.” The Third Phase , Qualification, provided sufficient eluc idation to establis h the tenets of contem porary Satanism , contrary to prior or current m isinterpretation. The Satanic Bible, The Satanic Rituals, and The Satanic Witch m ight have been conveniently overlooked, but were readily obtainable to any w ho c hose to gain knowledge of our doctrine and methodology. An aura of respectability prevailed—often to a point of overcom pensation—to counterba lance inaccurate presum ptions by the outside world. The Fourth Phase , Control, encouraged dispersion a nd the “Peter Principle” as a m eans of isolating the “ideal” evaluated from Ph ase Two. De-institu tiona liza tion separa ted th e builders from the dwellers, thus filtering a nd stratifying what began as an initiatory organization—or persuasion—into a definite social structure. The Fifth Phase , Application, estab lishes tang ible fruition— the beginnin g of a harvest, so to speak. Techniques, having been deve loped, can be em ployed. The Myths of the Twentieth C entury are recognizable and exploi table as essential stim uli. Hum an foibles may be viewed with an u nderstand ing towards ra dical em bellishm ent.

Based on our understand ing of the m yths of the Twentieth Century, som e of us m ay work towards the form ation of the m ythology of the Twenty First Century. From the shat tering of sacred icons we m ove towards secular icon building, generating new archetype s that will join the current pantheon of essential imagery. W e are on the threshold of what m ay be a long period during which the innovators in our m ovem ent for mulat e symbols and characters that embody the quintessence of our values—self-determ ination, discrim ination, and pride in accom plishm ent. In time, these m ay becom e br oadly accepted sigils of what is tru ly Satanic—as we define Satanism . Culturally our philosophy prom otes the id ea that a diverse range of choices should be open to the aware ind ividua l. The availabi lity of such options will a lways thre aten tyrants who wish to force “inf idels,” often on pain of deat h, towards conversion to their “One True Way.” It doesn’t m atter which deity is pictured benignly spreading his or her arm s for the forced follo wers. Satanists see th is embrace as th at offered by the “Virg in of Nurem berg,” and we refuse it. And the tim e may com e when our fellow travelers, who enjoy the benefits of our global secular so ciety, do likewise.

As we look through the land scape of what is currently offered, we see that Dr. LaVey’s vi sion has had broad cu ltu ral e ffect, as the am ount of fr eedom for personal pleasure has ab undantly increased on a ll levels of social strata. Dr. LaVey also noted that a prim e da nge r was that the old concept of finding a scapegoat to blam e for one’s actions is b ecom ing part of the w eft and weave of our society. The escape clau se that som e “Devil m ade m e do it” is behind the current victim - cultu re of politica l cor rectness th at ha s s een f ull f ruition in the extant laws of many nations. Crim inals who comm it r eprehens ible acts are often deem ed blam eless, while nebulous currents in society itself are given the m antle of responsibility for de mented, irresponsible behavior. We s ee our judiciary tacitly accepti ng the idea that people are autom atons, who m ust of necessity be progr amm ed from without by societal influences. This absolv es crim inals from blam e when they do what is co nsensus “ev il,” and seeks to put the responsibility anywhere but upon the heads of the perpetrators. H ence, we witness the widely p racticed twis ted theo ry of in justice, w hich m andates tha t “bla meless” crim inals must be offered m ercy and forgiveness. Satanists now call for a halt to this gr otesquery. We do this through the advocacy of our current watchword: Justice . Our m eans for its im plem entation is Lex Talionis — that punishm ent m ust fi t in kind and degree th e crim e. Such a dictum has been cherish ed in ancient cultures and is overdue for a full- scale rebirth. The doom that should be over every person is: “Let it be upon your own head.” Only you can take credit for your successes, and only you must be at fault for your failures. It is high tim e to put an end to the perpetual whining, finger pointing, and begging for speci al dispensations. And the current of general opinion is now fl owing towards our desired direction. The recen t terrorist attacks on the United States evoked a worldwide fervo r that just retribution be m eted out for these crim inal acts. Mercy is being discarded in favor of a true Satanic passion for justice. W e have re ached a historical fulc rum point where in the mass of widely em braced values m ay now be leveraged in o ur desired direction. The tim e is now for Satanists, and others who cheris h individual liberty, to expose the m adness of religious f anaticism , wherever it m ay arise, a nd show the world-at-large that our freedom is threatened by those willing to die f or the ir immater ial d eities. W e m ay s ee a continued societal transfor mation, if the understanding of th e nature of the current situation is kept in sharp f ocus. The f orm er days of forgiveness will be end ed as aroused nations v isit their wrath upon those who are enem ies to the freedoms offered by secular civilization. I stress that our organiza tion and philosophy are both or ganic, ever evolving, for they are predicated on the continued deepen ing of our understanding of the beast called Man. Such knowledge may be utilized to broaden the horizons of freedom and responsibility—but this pract ice dem ands virtuosity. Anton LaVey established an insightful foundation which stands us in good stead as we further explore the im plications of his ideas while we elaborate the a pplica tions of Satanism in our current cultural milieu, setting the stage for future perm utations.

There are m asters and there are slaves, and quite a few shades in between. Satan ism can be a great “l aunching pad” for those who are realists, to see where th ey stand in their level of pers onal achievem ent and to rationally decide how to advance them selves in whatever m anner they choose. They also have the option to not advance them selves, but to enjoy wh atever level they have attained. The old saw about a group being “all chie fs and no Indians” is certainly one that has found a new lease amongst “nouveau Satanist s.” They are sim ply not being honest in their self-evaluation—a practi ce that all but guarantees thei r failure to work m agic of both Greater and Lesser varietie s. The self-aware individual evaluates his position w ith ruthless accuracy, and if he has the desire to attain a higher level, then he m akes the efforts to do so by exercising his talents. Th e observation of the developm ent of how an individual sees himself is a strong indicator for m arki ng his true journey along the Left Hand Path. What m any f ail to gr asp is tha t the re is no requirem ent that one m ust m ove to a higher echelon. As long as one has contentm ent and is enjoying one’s life, we Satanists place no m oral value on the stratum to which one belongs. Being what yo u really are and procuring pleasure is the goal that Satanism helps one sustain. There is no obligation to push yourself in a direction that does not com e naturally, and true Satanists don’t “lord it over” others whom they perceive to be of a lower rank. It is a fact, when one considers the vas t pop ulation on th is globe, that there is a strong lik elih ood that so meone will com e along who is brighter, more learned, more ta lented, m ore accom plis hed, and in som e way may have “bested” you in an area that you have as a personal pursuit. Scream ing that one is always “top dog” is a sure sign of insecur ity as well as ignoranc e of actual Satanism. Com petition with one’s own prior ac hievem ents is a healthy s tim ulus f or self -evolu tio n, but the final goal is to be th e best you can be, and not have unrealistic im ages of what one “should” becom e. Self-s atisfaction is the desi red result, not consta nt internal strife. Sim ilarly, many neophytes read about th e LaVey Personality Synthesizer in The Satanic Witch and then m ake moral judgm ents concerning w here they should stand on that sym bolic clock, often m isjudging their act ual position and thus i gnoring that there is no ethical verdict placed on any clock position. Satanists com e in a rem arkable variety— not all are “great innovators” or “fearless leaders,” or dom inant individuals. In fact, it takes a real Satanist to appreci ate the few who do have those abilities to create and lead, and to enjoy what these people have to offe r without feeling any need to try and outdo them if such is not natural to h imself. To think th at “activ ity /dom inance” is “good” an d that “p assiv ity/subm issio n” is “bad ” m eans one has fallen into the false dichotom y of dualist thinking.

They explore and ascertain their strengths and weaknesses, and do not flinch f rom adapting to best m eet th eir needs. There are tim es when masochis tic in dividua ls, oblivious to their own natures, are attracted to Satanists, antagonizing them in an attem pt to goad them into exercising this real, not postured, power. Each Satanist, as L aVey explained, is an Epicurean Sadist, and when such m asochists approach, the Satanist often says “No!” to th e symbolic request for a “beating,” thus turning th e m asochist’s sought-after eustress into dis tress. But the Satanist’s option to say “Yes!” also exists, and h e can then provide the masochis t with the requested “beating,” but only if it al so gives the Satanist satisfaction. These are subtleties, and the m isdirec ted m asochist should preferably find a loving m aster willing to dispense th e desir ed dis ciplinary a ctions in th e d egree that w ill gratify the m asochist’s needs.

He will grasp that to be Satanic is to be beyond such conventional judgm ents and naïve assessm ents.

The use of the adjectiv e “Satanic” with the noun “community” is oxym oronic. Why? The process of creating a “community” im plies that its m embers com e out into the open and becom e quantifiable, defining and exposing them selves. This technique is alm ost always used by an assem blage of peopl e who want to claim som e for m of victim status, who want to whine th at they are oppressed, and thus agitate for som e for m of “special dis pensations” for their m embers. This idea is anath ema to Satanists and contrary to Satanic p rinciples. Recall Anton LaVey’s dictum that the Church of Satan must rem ain “a custard that can’t be naile d to the wall”? W hile our philosophy is m ade abundantly clear through publicly available literature, the organization itself rem ains largely hidden. There is power in m ystery.

Please re-read the previous line un til it begins to s ink in. Satanism is a unique philosophy that has spawned an even more unusual move ment and an organization, the C hurch of Satan, which has found a means for facilitating the inte rac tio n of a m embership com prised of radical individualists. It is, in an apparent paradox that is a “t hird-side synthesis,” an orga nization for non-joiners. The structural basis for the C hurch of Satan is the cab al concep t. I t is m aintain ed, f or the most part, as an underground cell-sy stem of individuals who shar e the basis of the philosophy created by Anton Szandor LaVey, but who find very unique w ays of applying this philosophy towards their own personal goals. Above the surf ace, you m ight see som e spokespersons and som e discussion forum s th at have a public presence. But, like an iceberg, m ost of our m embership rem ains hidden in the m urky depths. S ome new members m istakenly want to publish m embership lists, as they fail to grasp this concept behind the structure of the or ganization. They still haven’t shaken off pre-conceptions absorbed from herd culture. If, after explanat ions, they don’t begin to grasp that they are still thinking in a non-Satani c paradigm and thus they are working to counter our intentional structure, they m ay be asked to leave the organization.

Look at the evidence for this in the ghetto of online Satanism , which is a very sm all subset of people who call them selves Satanist s.

I have m et and corresponded with thousands of Satanists. I know this to be a fact. There are certainly som e common threads, which can be deduced by considering the principles that under- gird The Satanic Bible.

Our m embers aroun d the globe, and even Satanis ts who have em braced the p rinciples of The Satanic Bible, m ay stand up for the ideas they hold dear, but only if they unders tand them fully and can articulate them wit h finesse in w hatever situation arises. Nothing is more saddening to us than a well-m eaning but verbally unskilled indivi dual attempting to explain Dr. LaVey’s concepts and thus garbling them com pletely, or allowing an interv iewer to le ad him into a distortion th at is dam aging to our public visage. Then, our chos en Agents m ust do double-duty to clarify the m isinform ation inadvertently spread, a nd with today’s electronic m edia such brushfires can rapidly becom e wide spread conflagrations. If you really think you might have talents in this area, then you should be able to prove that to us. It is relatively easy f or members to becom e Agents, and part of the journey towards that official re sponsibility is to already be working to clarify errors you might find a bout Satanism and showing us how well you did. Since our religion is a very controversial one, we cannot afford to m ake m istakes, so we will not allo w people to represent us unless we are convinced that they will always present our ideas with great precision. One of the dangers of Satanic philosophy is that it “puffsup” som e people, giving them over-inflated illusions of their own value to othe rs. The current appallingly- dem ocratic notion that everyone’s opinion m ust be given equal validity is carried over into Satanism when these folks all take th e notion that “You are your ow n God” and then assum e that they are everyone else’s God as well. And they forget, once entering into a pantheon of self -proc laim ed deities, that a ll G ods are not of equal statur e. Stratif icatio n, once again, always comes into pla y. This principle is another th at is frequently ignored or misunderstood by those new to Satanism . As far as I can tell, the rest of the wo rld’s religions and philosophies don’t have this prob lem , and this is generally because th ey p reach subm ission.

This does not help the stat ure of the m ove ment, for reasons that should be obvious. Another aside: Here’s a di abolical thought. If som eone really started an actual, honest-to-Satan “Anton LaVey Fan Club,” a nd had the guts to call it that, they just m ight gain our respect. Fan club s are associations of people who band together in their adm iration for som ething that they had no hand in creating. These groups often focus on film s—partic ularly those that create their ow n fictional universe, actors, m usicians, or other publicly prom inent person ages. The fans didn’t m ake the film, nor did they cr eate the stage persona of the actor or assist in the growth of his talent, nor did they organize the band. They just encountered these things and developed a fervid interest in them . These fans do not claim to represent “that which they adm ire” since th e objects of adm iration naturally have professio nal rep resen tation. They just share th eir interest with each other. The object of their adm iration m ight even license them the right (for a sm all percentage) to produ ce authorized souvenirs or in the case of fil ms, the studios m ake their own m erchandise to sell to the fans. This is generally a light- hearted m eans for people to interact, though bitter disputes have been known to erupt in such groups. We see no relevant reason for those who agree with Anton LaVey’s philosophy not to join the C hur ch of Satan. However, thinking that Anton LaVey was “cool” does not m ean that you are necessarily a Satanist. Som e who m ight find our philosophy and standard s too challenging, but who adm ire Dr. LaVey, could band together and create a fa n club, without the pr etensions at being a Satanic organization or towards repr esenting S atanism , Ant on LaVey, or the Church of Satan.

Their desire to purloin our designation does not change the fact that Satanism has been defined. It does not allow for distortions such as belief in cosm ic entities, anim al sacrifice, or claim s that one is a “demon incarnate” am ongst other theistic delusions. Our Church has no room for people who do not fully understand our philosophy. Additionally, the tapestry of Satanism cannot be stretched to prom ote crim inal behavior and mindless hedonism . These ideas are at odds with the logical and life- celebrating dem eanor of the sk eptical Epicurean atheism that is our axiom atic philosophy.

Som e of these “Satan-fans” propose that Satanists should rebel against Satanism or its organizational exemplar, the C hurch of Satan, to prove their i ndividuality thus be considered “more Satanic.” They m isperceive our cham pioning of freedom and individualism to m ean support of a disregar d for personal responsibility. They are wrong. “Responsibility to the responsib le” is one of our mottos. Som e newc om ers to our philosophy do not gr asp its axiom s and tear at Satanism as if it were som e kind of strait-jacket.

Anton LaVey’s entire purpose for founding the Chur ch of Satan was to create a rational philosophy defining Satanism for the very first tim e in W estern history as an aboveground, coherent move ment. He succeeded in his efforts to do so, dem onstrated by the health of his Ch urch and the expand ing presenc e of his writin gs 40 year s later. And we who worked at his sid e intend to preserve and build upon his legacy, which we see as a durable foundation in no need of am endm ent.

Anton LaVey directly addressed the issue of those rare Church of Satan mem bers who reach a point where they feel th at they m ust try to appo int them selves as the “s avio rs of Satanism .” To m ost Satanists, these sowers of discord appear ignorant since one of our funda mental principles is that we are each our O WN saviors. W e have never welcom ed people who suffer from a m essianic m artyrdo m com plex, and m embers of the Church of Satan are ex pected to kn ow this. From his essay, “The World’ s Most Powerf ul Religion ”: Satanism is the only religion which se rves to en courage and en hance one’s individual preferences, so long as there is adm ission of those needs. Thus, one’s personal and indelible religion (t he picture) is integrated into a perfect fra me. It’s a celebration of individuality with out hypocrisy, of solidarity without mindlessness, of objective subjectivity. Th ere need be no deviation from these principles. T hey should summ arily negate internecine strife and bickering. Any attem pts at Satanic ‘ref orm ation’ should be seen for what they are: creating problem s where none ex ist. There sh ould be no p lace in any relig ion for refor mers whose very religion is the fetish of refor mation. There is even a place and title for com pulsive dissidents, and if they can w ear the m antle, they are welcom e. They would delude them selves to be revolu tionaries. In our cam p, they are called “House Mas ochists. ” LaVey vividly described the antics of these types as “shitting on th e carpet and throwing them selves out the wind ow.” That sort of “perfo rm ance” leaves the reluctant aud ience to clean up the excreta and puts the p erpetrator outside the cabal he had f ormerly trea ted with respect. The good Doktor said that he was not inclined to open the door, allowing such desperate “em ancipators” b ack inside when they can ’t b e trus ted to refrain from an encore. He s aw this happ en again and again, and would shake his head at such infantile conduct. In evitab ly, we’ve been witn ess to a num ber of shows by newer additions to “The House Masochist P layers” since our founder’s dem ise. In past years our m embers were isolat ed from one another and being a lone iconoclast m aking your way a mongst the dull ra bble was a powerful m eans of self- definition for a Satanist. Today, with so m any lives played out publicly online in blogs and via those vilely egalitarian personal ne twork ing sites, the solitary ou tsider has a greater opportunity to encounter m ore of his kind, as well as the poseurs . In the Church of Satan one quickly finds that the or thodoxy is being unorthodox. The robust m embers "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"of our “asso ciation of th e alienated ” will be delig hted to d isco ver f ellow tr ibe m embers. However, som e who have weaker egos m ight fee l stifled, that their uniqueness is com prom ised when they aren’t the prim ary nonconfor mist in the bunch, but m ust take their place amongst comparably outrageous oddb alls. Or they m ight discover that their personal aes thetic choices aren’t equally em braced by all of their diabolical compadres . At that po int, if they decide that they must find a m eans to distance them selves from their fellow cultu ral r enegade s, then th e o nly plac e th ey can go is back to their isolated outpost am ongst the shuffling zombies. Unfortunately, th ey m ight treat us to a farewell exhibition before they exit—s tage right. These agitators m ay have issues cau sed by self-aggrandi zing tunnel vision, missing the big picture that our organization supports m any unusual individuals and their singular pref erences. Instead of rationally discussing personal dissatisfactions, the House Masochist “acts out” in a m anner disrespect ful to the com pany he supposedly holds in regard. He m ay have lost the ability to comm and attention and respect from his peers through creativity, and so now m ust throw a ta ntrum to gain notice. Ironically, he casts him self in the role of “outsider to the out siders” w hich places him back in with the various clas ses (pro le, m iddle, upper) of herd-t ypes. Thus he is ex iling him self from the “X Class”— a self-created, ar istocracy of the bright and talented, which in cludes a ll genuine Satanists (see P aul Fussell’s book Class ). So, following the practice of our founder, these self-proclaim ed turds in the punch bowl are welcom ed to flush them selves, unless th ey are con tent to receive the scorn and derision their m asochistic behavior has merited. Som e seem sur prised that they’ve “a sked for it.” T here’s nothing m ore pathetic, or less Sa tan ic, than a m asochist lack ing self -awar eness. LaVey em phasized that his parad igm fo r deportm ent within the Church of Stan was for our m embers to treat each o ther as ladies and gentlem en. There is enough strife outside of our organization to satisfy those w ith a fetish f or co nflict. He ne ver requ ired that all Satanists lik e each other. S ince we’ve neve r been about fellowship, we don’t require that all of our mem bers wor k with each other, either. Here is th e basic house rule: When m embers have conflicting values, they are to go their own ways, not wasting energy and tim e sniping at the m embers who ha ve selected different m ethods of applying Satanism to reach person al satisfactio n. Quite a s imple guideline, we think . However, this is too m uch to expect from som e, usually the ones who never got Satanic Rule of the Earth num ber 1: “Do not give opinio ns or advice unless you are asked.” If you encounter a would-be m utineer to Satanism, you should ask the question “What are you rebelling against? ” If the reply is that “Sat anism is conform ist” you might look around at the varied collec tion of interesting folk and wonder what blinders he’s been wearing. If you hear that “Satanism is too restrictive,” then you need to follow-up and find precisely what this person thinks is being forbidden by Satanic philosophy. Chances are it will be so me act currently deem ed to be against local laws. Satanism can’t stop people from crim inal beha vior. It does counsel them to be aware of laws and to advocate their reform when proper, b ut m eanwhile to be prep ared to accept the results if disobedience leads to prosecution and incarcerat ion. If the answer is sim ply “W hat have you got? ” that reply indicates the responder is simply a directionless m alcontent, with no self-definition and no grasp of the fundam ental principles which go to order the hierarchies inherent in the hum an spe cies. Freedom always require s responsibility, and that responsibility includ es an honest and accu rate evaluation of the facts at hand as w ell "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"as wise decisions based on that knowledge. To sim ply think that being “anti-everything” and utterly without restrain t is a definition of Satanism is to entirely m iss our discrim inating foundation—our roots in Epicureanism . Satanists always rem ain in control of their exploration of pleasure. “Indulgence— NOT com pulsion” is our founder’s dictum that moves us out of hedonism, which by definition is unbridled and thus com pelle d. Epicureanism — the balanced seeking of physical and m ental self-satisfaction —em braces a wider rang e of gratification. It is refined, selective, and embodies our concep t of Indulgence. We are gourm ets in the banquet of existence. Hedonism is lim ited to base carnal pursuits. Epicureans aren’t prudes, nor are we slaves to any of our desire s; rather these are m otivators toward seeking all m anner of fulfilling experien ces. The he donis t blind ly sates his lu sts f or sex, sustenance, and som a—consequences be dam ned! That is a self-destru ctiv e course inappropriate for Satanists. The Satanist does what he wishes, taki ng full responsibility f or all consequences to his actions. W e live in hum an society and m ust be aware th at there are legal repercussion s that v ary in each locale. If you choose to igno re this factor and wind up in prison, you’ve becom e powerless an d will wa ste your preciou s days under the dom inion of others. Not the Satanic position of choice. If you live the life of a petty crim inal and consider your jail tim e to be a badge of “outrageousness and iconoclasm ,” you’ll win only scorn f rom true Sata nists. W e see that p enal institutions are f ull of sk ills of a s imilar ilk and are not favorably im pressed. Satanism doe s not deny pleasure or deep and varied pursuit of it, but it counsels that wisdom and sensibility m ust be em ployed in search of fulfilling In dulgence. Pr agm atism is axiom atic to our system ; we are re alists. So Satan ists as a childish recipe for personal disaster. Satanists understand that “good” and “ev il” are purely subjective values, hence we oppose that which af fects us negatively. That is a personal judgm ent based on what we determ ine to be of value. W e are not autom atic contrarians, sim ply countering whatever is in widespread soci al fashion or m ight be prevalen t in our v icinity. This latter approach brings to m ind the Monty P ython sketch in which a fellow seeks an argum ent, but sim ply gets an opponent who autom atical ly gainsays whatever statements are presented. Being guided solely by “whatever it is, I’m against it,” m eans that you are enslaved to the people w hom you oppose, as they determ ine what your reaction s will be. The Satanist, who naturally sees him self as his own God, does not generally care what other people think about him . His m onum ental sense of self worth leaves no possibility for him to be touched by critiques from th e unworthy, but he does exam ine the reactions of the individuals whom he has com e to ch erish and respect. Thus the discrim inating iconoclast and true rebel dissents out of reason and passion, and possible options, not knee-jerk reactivity. Definitions are crucial for establishing hum an comm unication. If the m eanings of words were whatever one felt they shoul d be according to whim (re member Lewis Carroll’s Queen of Hearts?), only confusion would result. We therefore defend the clear and concise definition of Satanism created by Anton LaVey, and do not perm it it to be adulterated by outside pseudo- Satanists and insiders who lose track of the elegant architecture of Dr. LaVe y’s prin cip les. Sata nism will con tinu e to tak e into account th e evolution of hum an society, based on an unf linching evaluation of the nature of the hum an beast. Such adaptability is “built-in.” It is a system wit hout frozen dogm a, being "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"inheren tly f lexible.

This is a m etaphorical perspective fo r viewing the mechanism s of Greater Magic. Tim e travel is an attem pt to look back ward and bring those things that have passed and a re dis tant in m emory/time into sh arpe r focus—to leapf rog over inte rim experiences and experience chosen past m oments afresh. So me of these events hav e a tie to the eternal Now of consciousness, wh ich allows that consciousness to jum p imm ediately to these past tableaux, skipping all other less signifi cant events in one’s linear past. The cable that binds the conscious ness to these ever-visib le mountain peaks is em otion. Emotion apparently com es from the “o ldest” part of the brain (that which was earliest to evolve), and is an instantan eous instinc tual deep evaluation of a situation that "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"is being exp erien ced in the Now. It adds what could be viewed as a “color” or tonality to that s itua tio n, so that it is etern ally m arked in the consciousness and is thus hierarch ically ordered in the past. A Satanic M agician can thus attem pt consciously to em otionally “tint” or harm onize events from the linear past of othe rs ( which collec tive ly is ref erred to as history). By m aking a “tim e travel journey” to them he m ay a bsorb them into his own past through the “virtual reality ” experience which a rite of tie travel can bring to this past event. The gateway which one m ust open in orde r to to ss his Is-To-Be ’s into another’s gravity well is that oldest “rep tile” part of the brain that can only be accessed via very strong em otion. In essence, the Greater Ma gic described by D r. LaVey is a process wherein one creates th ese coalescences taken from possible future events and focuses them into the one you want to happen. You m ust feel the need for it to ha ppen with th e deepest em otions of which you are capable, and it is by giving vent to this need in the ritual cham ber that you open that trap door a nd throw these Is-To-Be’s out there into the future possibilities of other consciousnesses, to b ecom e a need that will f all in to the gravity wells of individu als who hav e a bear ing on the m atter, who thus will f eel com pelled to m ove their purview according to your W ill. Of course, Lesser Magic is sim ply the day-to-day charm and glam our the Satanic Magician us es to m anipulate p eople into doing what is wan ted.

But then, th e Satanic Mag ician m ust be willing to ro le- play, to be a cham eleon and an acto r of exqui site skill to be able to push those buttons and throw the switches in that target i ndividual to m ake him do as you desire. Som e jejune people balk at that, saying, “I want people to know the real m e!” But they fail to realize that most people are far too narcissistic to even care. They only see what they solipsistically projec t on others. The Satanist chooses to be protean, a person of mystery, and only those whom he really cher ishes ever get to look behind the m yriad masks to see the substance of the individua l who sports them . Each Satanic Magician naturally adopts a general pers ona th at is of ten re flective of chosen elem ents of his essence. He is satisfied with his knowledge of his personal nature and so has no fear in adopting different guises.

It follows by analogy that vibrations on a “higher” level wi ll perhaps behave in sim ilar fashion to the lower vibrations with varia tions germ ane to that vibra tional frequency. Resonance is defined as a state wherein sound oscillations are reinforced, and thus sustained, because the natural f requency of the resonating body is the sam e as that of the sound source.

S ATANIS M IS NOT DEVIL WORSHIP. Tha t com es as a shock to m any who haven’t explored our philosophy and it is the prim e misconception outsiders have regarding the Church of Satan. Our founder Anton Szandor LaVey asserted this stance from the beginning. Over the years, indiv iduals with the n eed to feel embraced by a deity h ave claim ed that Dr. LaVey som ehow cam e to belie ve in a lite ral Satan. If we exam ine his work, it is clear that he never changed his mind about this, nor was belief in the Devil ever som e secret “inner circle” practice of the C hurch of Satan. We Satanists understand that both tr uth and fantasy are needed by the hum an anim al. It is a step towards wisdom when one knows with certainty which is which. Man relies on symbolism and m etaphor when build ing a personal conceptual fra mework for understanding the universe in which he lives. He has always invent ed his own gods using his carnal brain. From The Satanic B ible : “Man h as always created h is go ds, rather th an his gods creating him .” However, this act of creation is usually denied. History shows that the founders of religions claim ed persona l contact with the deity fabricated through their im aginations, and legions of followers bolstered that fiction. There is nothing wrong with fantasy, so long as an individual knows he is using this contro lled self-delusion as a tool for dealing with existence. For we skeptic al, pragm atic Satanists, it is wield ed in the ritu al cham ber. Reliance on a fantastic constr ucts becom es dangerous when the believers in spir itu al r elig ions dog matically in sist that their personal or collec tiv e fantas ies are real in the world at large, th at they are the only absolu te truth, and then wait f or the m yth to guide them or try to force others to shar e this delusion. That has been the source for countless wars, as any stude nt of history can see. Dr. LaVey’s sem inal book, The Satanic Bible published in 1969 lays out som e basic principles: The Satanis t realizes that m an, and the action and reaction of the universe, is responsible for everything, and doesn’t mislead him self into thinking that som eone cares. Is it not m ore sensible to worship a god that he, him self, has created, in accordan ce with his ow n em otional needs —one that best rep resents the v ery carnal and physical being th at has the idea-power to invent a god in the first place? From a 1986 interview with W alter Harrington of The Washington Post : "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"“Satan is a sym bol, nothing m ore,” LaVey says. “Satan signifies our love of the worldly and our rejection of the pallid , inef fectual im age of Christ on the c ross.” Accepting the axiom atic prem ise th at no gods ex ist as indep endent supernatural entities means that Satanists are de facto atheists. W e know that the objective universe is indifferent to us. Since our philosophy is self -centered, each Satanist sees him self as the most im portant person in his life. Each indi vidual thus generates his own hierarchy of values and judges everything based on his own standards. Therefore, we Satanists appoint ourselves as the “Gods” in our subjective univer ses. That doesn’t m ean we think we have the powers of a m ythological deity, but it does mean that we revere the creativ e capacity in our species. So to distinguish ourselves from the atheists w ho sim ply reject God as non-existent, we call ourselves “I-theists,” wi th our own healthy ego as the center of our perspective. This is truly a blasphem ous concep t that flies in the f ace of just about every other religion, and it is why Satan serves us well as a sym bol. He was described as the prideful one, refusing to bow to Jehovah. He is the one who questi ons authority, seeking liberty beyond the stultifying realm of Heav en. He is the figure cham pioned by the likes of Mark Twain, Milton, and Byron as the indepe ndent critic who heroic ally stands on his own. Dr. LaVey m ade his m ost detailed pr esentation of his concept for how Satan functions in his philosophy in the following m onologue that a ppeared in Jack Fritscher’s book Popular Witchcraft, published in 1973. I don’t feel that raising the devil in an anthropom orphic sense is quite as f easible as theologians or m etaphysicians would lik e to think. I have felt His presence but only as an exteriorized extension of my own pot ential, as an alter-ego or evolved concept that I have been able to exte riorize. W ith a full awareness, I can communicate with this sem blance, this cr eature, this dem on, this personification that I see in the eyes of the sym bol of Satan—the goat of Mendes—as I comm une with it b efore the a ltar. None of these is any thing m ore than a m irror im age of that potential I perceive in m yself. I have th is awareness th at the ob jectifi cation is in accord with m y own e go. I’m not deluding m yself that I’m calling som ething that is disassociated or exteriorized from m yself the godhead. This Force is not a controlling factor that I have no control over. Th e Satanic principl e is th at m an willf ully controls h is destiny ; if he doesn’t, so me other m an—a lot sm arter than he is—will. Sa tan is, theref ore, an extens ion o f one’s psyc he or volitio nal essen ce, so that that extension can som etimes converse and give directives through the self in a way that thinking of the self as a single unit cannot. In this way it does help to depict in an externalized way the Devil per se. The purpose is to have som ething of an idolatrous, objective nature to comm une with. However, m an has connection, contact, control. This notion of an exteriorized God-Satan is not new. The approac h outlin ed h ere, of consc iously c reating an exte rioriza tion of the se lf with which one comm unes solely in ritual , is a revolutionary religious concept of LaVey’s Satanism , and it is a “th ird side” app roach which proves elusive to m any to whom it does "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"not com e naturally. It is a psychological sleight-of- mind, not a for m of faith. It estab lishe s that to the Sa tanis t in ritu al, he is Satan. To be fair, people attending workings of LaVey’s bom bastic and theatrical rites might not be able to separate the shouting of “Hail Satan!” while in the ritu al cham ber with the d isbelief in any extern al go ds outsi de of the cham ber. But then, Satanism isn’t meant for everybody. When asked if there is an upcom ing volum e Satanism for Dummies , we reply: “Satanism is NOT intende d for dumm ies.” As he said in The Satanic Bible and often in interviews: “Satanism de mands study—NOT worship.” The capacity to thin k is expected of Satanists. So LaVey exp ected tho se who em braced his philoso phy to understand where to draw the line between the f antastic and the real. He proclaim ed that he was a showm an, and felt that his S atani sts would not be rubes, m istaking the mumm ery for reality. As a carn ie, he knew how to entertain, to draw attention so that he could then present m ore serious ideas. So me m ight sneer at his m ethodology, dism issing his deeper cogitations b ecause of th e circus- like elem ents. However, I belief a cas e can be made that all re ligion s ar e in the “sho w busine ss,” but the Church of Satan is the only one honest enough to adm it it. In an in terv iew released on an LP called The Occ ult Explo sion from 1973, Dr. LaVey explained how the Church of Satan d eals with different c oncepts of Satan: “Satan” is, to us, a sym bol rather than an anthropom orphic being, although m any members of the Church of Satan who are mystic ally inclined would pref er to think of Satan in a very real, anth ropom orphic way. Of course, we do not discourag e this, becaus e we realize th at to m any individuals a pictu re, a w ell- wrought picture of their m entor or their tu telary divinity is very im portant for them to conceptualize ritualistically. Howe ver, Satan sym bolically is the teacher: the inform er of the whys and the wherefor es of the world. And in answer to those who would label us “Devil worshippers” or be very quick to assum e us to be Satan worshippers, I m ust say that S atan dem ands study, not worship, in its truest sym bology. We do not grovel; we do not get dow n on our knees, genuflect, and worship Satan. We do not plead, we do not im plore that Sata n give us what we wish. We feel that anyone who is going to be blessed by a ny god of his choice is going to have to show that god that he is capable of taki ng care of the blessing s that are received. Thus he advocates creating a god-symbol based on one ’s own needs and aesthetic choices. Creative fantasy is em ployed for emotional fulf illm ent, experienced in the context of the ritu al cham ber. Satan ists see Satan as th eir prope r sym bol to f ulfill those ne eds a magnification of the best within each of us. Additionally, LaVey speculated on the idea that when attem pting Grea ter Magic, it m ay be that the operator is tapping into a force that is part o f nature to m agnify his “Will.” This force is hid den, unknown, and thus “dark.” But LaVey did not view the force as a su pernatu ral entity. In The Satanic Bible he originally explained “the Satanist sim ply accepts the d efinition (of God) which suit s him best.” He closely f ollows tha t with the definition he uses: "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"To the Satanist “God”—by what-ever nam e he is called, or by no nam e at all—is seen as the balancing factor in nature, and not as being concerned with suffering. This powerful force which perm eates and balances the universe is far too im personal to care about the happiness or misery of flesh-and-blood creatures on this ball of dirt upon which we live. LaVey clearly posits a disinteres ted, rem ote force—not a pers onality or en tity— that balances the universe. H e sees it as indifferent to life form s, much as any other force such as gravity would be. It is a m echanism, not a personage. It does not m erit obeisance, appeasem ent, or worship. It can be nam ed or not. It operates without awareness of conscious beings. He spoke of this to Bu rton Wolfe who wrote in the introduction to The Satanic Bible . Of course LaVey pointed out to anyone who would lis ten th at the Dev il to him and his followers was not the stereotyped fellow cloaked in red garb, with horns, tail and pitchfork, but rather the dark forces in nature that hum an beings are just beginning to fathom . How di d LaVey square that explanation with his ow n appearan ce at tim es in black cowl with horns? He replied: “People need ritual, with sym bols such as those you find in base ball gam es or church services or wars, as vehicles f or expending em otions they can’t release or ev en understand on their own.” So LaVey accepted that there m ay be currently unexplain ed elem ents of the univers e that are part of its fabric, but these are not s upernatural. He suggest s that Man’s inquiring mind m ay e ventually com e to understand how they function. The im plications of these ideas offer great freedom. Since there is no actual deity watching over or m andating the behavior of our species, m en are free to im agine whatever sort of God they choose to satisfy their own needs, however they shoul d not forget that such fantasies are only that—nothing m ore. In that sam e passage, he also addresse d the prim e reason for engaging in ritual, which he defined as Greater Magic: it serves as a m eans for releasing pent-up em otions that people m ay not even fully understand. Hence ritual has a psychological purpose; it is clearly not m eant as a m eans for worship of som e supernatural entity. Ritual is dem onstrably part of hum an culture. LaVey kne w that it served a value for people o ver the m illennia, even if it was done for reason s that didn’t square with reality. It m ade people feel better than they did be forehand. So, as he continued in The Sat ani c Bi ble when addres sing the s earch for a pro per relig ion: “If he accep ts him self, but recogn izes that ritual and cerem ony are th e im portant devices that hi s invented religions have utilized to s ustain h is faith in a lie, th en it is the S AME FORM OF RITUAL that will sustain h is faith in the tr uth—the p rim itive pa geantry that will giv e his a wareness of his own m ajestic being added substance.” Thus th e device of ritual, which he explained as “controlled self delusion,” can be of practical use for the well being of one’s state of mind. The truth referred to above is that al l gods are an invention of the creative beast called Man.

Satan ism rejects faith as a too l of cognition, and so Satanists who practice ritual m ust gather evid ence that satisfies th eir standard s of truth if they suspect that their rituals are hav ing results ou tside of the chamber.

Thus we leave this as an open question that each Satanist who chooses to use ritual m ust answer for him self—does it do m ore than sim ply give em otional relief ? Only you can answer it, based on your personally chos en criteria for validity. Y ou m ight find yourself surprised. The for mat for our traditional ritual was created as a guideline that m ay be am ended by Satanists to suit their own aesth etics and em otional n eeds. Thus, Satanic Ritual is not presented as dogm a, but as a standard that has been found to be quite effective by thousands of Sa tanists from m any different cu ltural backgrounds. You m ay celeb rate the rites precisely as presented in the works of Dr. LaVey and in the following pages. Since they are effectively dram atic in structure and content. However, you m ay find elem ents that detract from your deepes t em otional arousal and so these m ay be altered to serve you best. Here at the Central Office for the Church of Satan, we’re often asked by interested parties if they must use black ca ndles, or absolutely m ust have all of the devices for ritual described in The Satanic Bible . Som e ask if they have to have a dedicated room to serve as a ritual cham ber. The answer is that you really don’t need any of the suggested im plements, since the m ost important tool f or ritual is your own im agination. A Satanist who does not have a fancy cham ber, sonorous gong, ornate chalice, or elaborate sword, m ay close his ey es an d pictu re all of these devices and he should have the ability to raise his em otions to their highest levels . If you do decide to gather the to ols, they sho uld be perso naliz ed and each have so me meaning that is m ost stim ulating to you. The idea of having an “insta nt ritual kit” sold to order is anathem a. You should obtain within your m eans whatever so rt of the described tools that will evoke your strong est aes thetic response. You m ay even have m ultiple version s to be used for differing ritual intent . T he choice is yours. In The Satanic Bible the origin al pres cribed p ractice was to us e at least on e black candle on the left and one white candle on the ri ght of your altar. That was dropped fairly quickly in rituals perform ed at Central Grot to, with two black candl es lighting th e altar and a white candle on top of a hum an skull us ed when cursing sessions w ere in order. The concept evolved that Satanist should be positively celebrated and that the white candle representing the sterility of spiritua l religions need only be em ployed when Destruction was invoked . Ultim ately, any colo r candles will d o, so long as they “feel proper” to you. As is said these days, it is “all about you !” The texts them selves can also be altere d to suit your particular sense of rhythm and im agery, and of course m emorizing th em in worthwhile as it allows you to concentrate more intensely on their m eaning. Howe ver, if this is too difficult or leads to the fear that you’ll “forget your lines,” you m ay r ead the printed words. Many Satanists have found that printing the specific texts in a form at that is easy to read in candlelight is worthwhile. Retyping or hand-copyin g the tex ts, putting them in a pleas ing font, printin g them on beautiful paper and binding them in a large book or even keeping them in a ring- binder with a plain or decorated cover are e ffective m ethods. Your self-created “Black Ritual Book” can grow over tim e, and be a uni que accouterm ent and record of your ritual practice. "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Since ritual is about unasham ed releas ing of em otion and single-m indedness of inten t, it is o ften f ar bette r to engag e in ritu al by oneself rather than have any additional people in th e cham ber who distract from your central m otivation. Solitude can be bes t. The person leading the ritual always takes the role of Celebrant, but th is is n’t m eant f or the ritual to be a theatre piece m aking you the “star” for a cap tive, passive audience th at has other issues on their m inds. Satanism is self-centered, so you as your own God take the prim e position, thus you shoul d only have ad dition al particip ants if th ey are truly “in synch” with your purpose and can be utterly and actively supportive of you as Celebrant. When Satanists new to ritual ask about wh en they should ritualize, I explain that whatever tim e suits them best is perfect, whet her it’s dictated by the need for privacy and quiet or by coordinating the sc hedules of like-m inded fellows who wish to join in the particular working. Dr. LaVey presented theori es for properly tim ing rituals in his books, so do explore his suggestions. If the dark hours are m ost suitable for your rites, and that is trad ition al, m any Satanists have en joyed using the night of the new m oon as the cho sen occasion, as this is the tim e of the month when the sky is black, suiting the sym bolism of Satanism ’s e mbrace of Darkness a s a positiv e im age. Our standard ritual takes note of the very ancien t idea of the four com pass directions having a corresponde nce with what were once considered the f our basic elem ents that com prised all that ex isted. In the standard Satanic Ritual, Anton LaVey linked these with the four crown princes of Hell found in grimoires such as The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage : Sa tan —the south -fire, Lucif er—the eas t—air, Belial— the north—ea rth, and Leviathan—the we st—water. A ddition ally, since Chr istian churches often had their altars set in the east to id entif y the ir mythical Ch rist’s r ising with that of the rising sun, Dr. LaVe y suggested the preferred direct ion for the S atanic altar be the west, blasphem ously opposing the Christia n mode. Howe ver, this is not obligatory and any direction m ay be utilized by the Sata nist. You m ight even try focusing your ritual in different directions, should th at bring enhanced stim ulation. Since Satan ism is a relig ion that em braces the Earth and v iews ourselv es as being part of nature, we don’t have the sam e thinki ng that other religions do about the need to “purify” our ritual tools. We are carnal, profane people, with an “un-religion.” The consecration of i mple ments was not addressed by Anton LaVey in The Satanic Bible, so you m ay simply obtain your device s and use them directly. In W estern magical practice, and in neo-pagan religions that have evolved from r oots in cerem onial magic, the idea of dedicating ritual tools is persiste nt. So, even though there is no need to ta ke this s tep with your ritual tools, the Satanist might decide that it would be pleasurable to dedicate, rather than purify, a cerem onial object before using it. This is an enrichm ent of ritual p ractice , but is not in any way m andator y. If you choose to dedicate yo ur ritual tools I present the following method. A SAT ANI C RITE OF DEDI CAT ION This is a solitary rite, since you are persona lly recognizing an object as being raised as significant to you, an “elite” t ool to be your com panion in your workings of Greater Magic.

The eighth step, m eant for blessing the congregation, becom es the point where you dedicate the object.

Celebrant sprinkles incense on coals (or ignites cone or st ick incense) saying: “Behold the am alga m of the blazi ng inferno and tem pestuous storm .” He picks up the object to be dedicated and hol ds it over the rising incense (or swings the thurible around an object too large to hold ove r it) saying: “In the name of Satan, Lord of Fire, and Lucifer, Lord of Air, I dedicate this [ name of tool ] of the Black Art.

The public already had their senses benum bed from the social upheavals of the sixt ies, yet they were shocked to witness a couple m aking vows in the nam e of Satan befo re a nude female altar, being joined in unholy m atrim ony. Weddings are widely accepted as the dom ain of es tablished religions and this is why people were alarm ed—they sa w how an alternative religion could usurp a practice they felt belonged onl y to them . How da re we! Of course, m ost religions snub secular civil weddings as ju st a poor m an’s alternative to their “superior” product, endorsed by their deity of choice. Finding a church dedicated to cham pioning Satan and using the Devil’s nam e to hallow a bond was tr uly revolutionary. As far as m ost religions were concerned, Satan was the one who insp ire d ram pant lust which lea d to the dissolution of the unions they we re trying so hard to cem ent! At m ost, they m ight have thought, the Prince of Darkness w ould cajole people to elope for one of those wacky Las Vegas ceremonies. Being joined by a pseudo- Elvis was certainly diabolical—rem ember how he used to lasciviously swivel those hips? Since we Satanists are dedicated to en joying ou r lives to the fullest, we embrace the full range of hum an em otions and that goe s from the extrem es of darkest hate through deepest love—both of whic h are rare in our li ves’ experience. In The Satanic Bible , Anton LaVey provided a m eans for throwing curs es to purge the destructive urges arising when one is unjustly wronged. He also cel ebrated the profound love that m embers had for each oth er by perform ing wedding rites. The text below is inspired by a fragm entary cerem ony fr om the early days of the Church of Satan that was then used as a basic form at which could be am ended at will depending upon the circum stances of the union. The rite presented here has been newly revised, ye t has m uch in common with my origin al version that had been perfor med by m emb ers of our Priesthood of Mendes for m any years. In Satanism , the basis for a couple form ing a union is the loving relationship they have created. It does not m atter if the couple is of the sam e or opposite sexes. This bond requires no sanction from the stat e, nor any blessings by deities of any sort. It is form ed by the partners, will be sustained by them , and may dissolve when they evolve beyond whatever factors caused their love to flourish. Since we Sata nists are generally solitary folk, we’ve never felt the need to have overt displays of our f eelings to the public at large. When we form deep relationships, they ar e between the individuals involved, and not subject to ex ternal social contracts. B ut the Church of Satan does not ignore the history of hum an behavior, and so we understand that a loving couple m ay wish to dem onstrate their exultant pride in the relationship th ey’ve form ed by havi ng a cerem ony and inviting "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"people who have m eaning in their lives.

I f we can, we will cheat death at every turn, to continue living well. But we also understand that our lives will even tua lly ce ase. W hen som eone we cherish dies, we reg ret the los s of a worthy com panion. When we die, the end of consci ousness is upon us and we cannot experience what happen s am ongst those who succeed us. Lif e cycles end lessly, and we are part of this process. So we enjoy the here and now, and do not look for a fictive afterlife. Unlike death-centered religions, from anci ent E gypt with its elaborate funerary custom s to contem porary Christianity and its s tultified platitu des, Satan ism acknowledges that death is the end. As is written in The Satanic Bible : “There is no Heaven of glory bright, and no Hell where sinners roast. Here and now is our day of torm ent! Here and now is our day of joy!” The Church of Sata n therefore does not re quire that words be spoken over the rem ains of our m embers.

W e do not believe that we need an “insurance policy” for the dead to get what is deserved from whatever supposed G ods control justic e in the h ereafter.

We find wor ld mythology to be our field from whic h to ha rvest sym bols and m etaphors that we find to resonate m ost strongly with our Satanic nature s. W hen exploring a pa rticular historical mythology, we do not simply pick som ething th at is NOT Christian, or not a part of Christianity’s various antecedents an d offshoot s; we look instead to a m yth system and ferret out its unique dark side, the taboo and forbidden regions that its adh erents h eld in awe and terror. That’s w here the Devils are to be found. This rite is an exercise in “exoticism ”—an old practice in the West for purloining elem ents from foreign cultures that might se em too alien to be com prehended in their foreign form. Thus they becom e palatable a nd enjoyable in an adu lterated state. Such absorptions launch trends in the arts. Art D eco had been influenced by the discovery of Tutankham un’s tom b in 1922. Musically it ha ppened in the classical realm when com posers like Beethoven im ported into his Ninth Sym phony the trum pets, drum s, and cym bals used by m arching Turkish janissaries. Closer to our own tim e was the explosion of the “Tiki Lounge” fad. In the 1950s, a faux ve rsion of Pacific tribal culture was created to transport Western viewers into a state of blissful other-worldlin ess. Statues of gods were m ade into m ugs for exotic cocktails ; Asian f ood was garnished with pineapple; elem ents of prim itive is land arch itec ture wer e implem ented to crea te to tal environm ents that entertained, but had little relationship to original uses. So, only curm udgeons demand that you m ust experience such im ports in th eir original forms—authenticity be dam ned! I’ve chos en to im port elem ents from anci ent Northern European pagan beliefs to flavor the “ stew” tha t is our trad ition al ritua l prac tice in the C hurch of Satan. This is n ot to be construed as pretending to be authenti c, or to be in any way representative of ancient or neo-pagan beliefs or practices. It is solely a m eans to explore the sym bolis m of Darkness from a distinct cultural m ilieu by a dopting it into the context of contem por ary Satanism . The sam e could be done with othe r n on-Christian cultu ral trad itions such as ritu als u tilizing Greek an d Rom an deities. Asian chthonic im agery can p rovide rich source m aterial. Eastern art abounds with re sonant dem onic representations from the pantheons of China, Japan and Tibet. The purpose of this rite is to expedite the shattering of a so cial order that has becom e m oribund, seeing it cleared away to prepare for a new society based on values that will bring prosperity and satisfaction to the celeb rants. This Norse apocalypse, Ragnarök, is depicted in various literary works handed down to the present. In the prose and poetic Eddas, there are vivid descriptions of the events casting down the old Gods, and I’ve used these as source material to fuel the litany.

When Anton LaVey releas ed The Satanic Rituals , he included rites that had Germ an, Russian, Middle Eastern, and French roots, and so Satanists who perform these workings freely identify with their ancestral fellows from all of these trad ition s. Likewise, you need not be des cended f rom Northern European stock to appreciate and participate in this powerful ritual—you need only be a Satanist. Originally w ritten in the la te 1980s, this is a m ilitant rite, not for the tim id, and it is exaggerated in its cataclysm ic dram atics.

Particularly effective is the sym bol I designed called the Ragnarök Rune, which consists of a variant on the rune of outward radiating power with a wolf ’s cross (sign of Hel and unchangeable fate) at the center. Clothing m ay be the standard black robes, but one can also adopt a wa rrior-like appearan ce, creating a “Satanic Soldier ” im age since trad ition al nor thern gea r tod ay tends to b ring to m ind Anna Russell, Hägar the H orrible, or refugees from SCA gatherings.

Music is of param ount importance to this working. I have found a particular recording, when cued correctly, will serve quite w ell ( Wagner: The Ring Without Words; Berlin Philharm onic conducted by L orin Maazel ). During the Conflagration one m ay also play recordings of thunder and windstorm s, or if exterior, have several drummers playing arrhythm ically to approxim ate thunder. If desired, lightning generators m ay also be em ployed at this stage (van de Graf generato rs o r Tesla co ils), As a closin g anthem , we have found Dr. LaVey’s “Hym n of t he Sata nic Empire” to be em inently suitable. There are several runic s ystem s that have varied and evolved over tim e, as living languages tend to do.

"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Nocturne: To The Devil Born P ETER H. GILMORE was born in Paterson, New Jersey, Am erica’s first planned industrial city; he shares hi s birthplace with Colt Firear ms and the first practical subm arine, the Fenian R am, built by invento r and Paterson s choolteacher John Hollan d in 1879. Peter’s fa mily background, however, is no t industrial but artistic. H is grandfather David trod the boards as a vaudevillian with hi s own traveling minstr el show; he played different ethnic characters and m ade a few record ings. Pete r’s m aternal grandfather, William , was a pastry ch ef m uch in dem and at the resor ts alon g the Atlan tic seaboa rd; he created larg e arch itectural rep resen tations in pastry, and ice sculptures that dom inated the buffet tables at the fanciest parties a nd banquets. Donald, Peter’s father, was a dog groom er and handler as well as a sm all busin ess man and entrepren eur; h e estab lish ed several shops, kennels and f acilities around the tri-state area, and handled cham pions at Westm inster as well as o ther m ajor c ompetition s. Peter’ s Mo m, Frances, painted and decora ted; s he exerc ised her ar tistic abilities in h er hom e by crea ting th ings to m ake it beautiful, and encouraged her children to do th e sam e. She is also a self-taught organist and enjoys playing the old standards for he r own pleasure and that of her friends and family. This early exposure to the business of dog breeding and champion bloodlines quickly gave Peter an adult’s perspective on the biological sciences in general. Puppies cam e from breeding dogs before they got to th ose newspaper-strewn bins at the pet shop, and Peter concluded that babi es had a sim ilar source; h c onfirm ed this by checking out a few biology books at the library. Hi s parents allowed Peter to e xplore his early interest in anim als and nature in general; his bedroom gurgled with several aquarium s, tanks and terrarium s, and he took over the backyard w ith a wading pool for captured turtles, frogs, snakes and other squishy things he fo und in the w oods. Peter was independent, inquisitive and fearless of the non-hum an inhab itants of the forests of the lower Hudson Valley where he grew up; he’d wander on his own for hours and knew the location of hidden lakes, caves and waterfalls. He was a smart kid, learned to read qu ite early and began exploring books. Books fed his im agination, and his im agination pushe d him to create the things with his hands that did not exist for purchase. He made fort s, models, and m iniature cities as well as creating and recording the histories, political system s, and urban pl anning that went along with them . And he read, read, read as m uch as he could of the m yths and pantheons of the Rom an, Gre ek, and Hindu gods, being fascinated by the ruins of “los t civilizations” as well as looking into the strange beliefs of present-day wo rld religions. P eter quickly concluded that all these myth-system s were on the sam e footing: inte resting stories m ade "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"up to help people feel m ore im portant in the vast schem e of things, when in fact they were no higher or lower than the bears he observed in the woods, or the hawks that soared overhead. The anim als he adm ired didn’t need gods, and nether did he. By rote and custom , however, Peter’s pa rents required him to learn their loose Rom an Catholicism and he part icipated in this religious instruction for as long as necessary, acting as an anthropolog ist studying an odd prim itive culture. He has a clear memory of officially declaring his atheis m on the day of his First Holy C omm union at age eight. After weeks of “studying” to receive this sacram ent—the purported transubstantiation of bread and wine into th e body and blood of Christ —Peter insisted it was just ano ther m yth, and not as in teresting as the Greek on es f illed with heroes and monsters. Over twenty year s later I was sorting through a shelf of his books from childhood and I found his Communion Missal; he had inscribed his nam e and date of that milestone: May 1 st , 1966, the day af ter the foundi ng of the Church of Satan. Science, art, books, m ovies and the wonderf ul toys that went with them were his burning interests as he grew up. Like m any boys in the Sixtie s, Peter was fascinated by space exp loration, robots, and all the futuristic developm ents these things prom ised. He never m issed Star Trek or a NASA launch on television; he carefully com bed the TV Guide for late-night broadcasts of horror m ovi es, especially those involving vam pires or giant Japanese m onsters. W ithout his own i magination and drew pictures of scenes from his favorite movies and shows from m emory so he could enjoy these m agical im ages over and over again. He also illust rated favorite m yths and events f rom the histories he’d invented for his sci-fi civilizations. Peter never developed a taste for popular m usic. As he entered high school and concentrated m ore on painting and drawing al ong with his academ ic studies, he didn’t adopt rock music as a mode of rebellion, unlike m any other boys his age. Instead, his interest was sparked by the m usic of Beethove n; it was strong, bo mbastic, and com plex, engaging both his em otions and his intellect . An d it was m uch m ore like the f ilm music he’d also grown to love. Peter began ha unting the Newburgh Library, housed in a Victorian building with its co llection of LPs, and eventua lly discovered another favorite com poser, Gustav Mahler. He would blast th e m usic of Mahler and Beethoven for hours while he worked on his surrealistic pain tings inspired by Bosch, Dali, and Ernst; som etimes he’d m iss school for days stayi ng awake around the clock while he worked on som ething that was absorbing him . Despite thes e absence s, Peter was th e Va ledictorian for our graduating class and at the top of our school’s National H onor Society. One of his innovations while participating in the NHS was to m ake the induction cerem ony more gothic and atm ospheric with darkness and candles and a ve ry secular, individualist oath. He did an Easter p resentation in a social stud ies class in opposition to som e “born-against” reading from Christian scriptures. He chose texts from The Satanic B ible and read them dram atically over recordings of Musso rgsky’s “N ight on Bald Mountain” and Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring.” Parent s who heard from their kids about this com plained to the board of education but when the principal confront ed him, Peter stood his ground explaining that there should be pl uralism of viewpoints—and the m an agreed. The 70s were far m ore liberal tim es than now. Peter a lso wor ked as the E ditor -in-Chief of our yearbook and created the pa intings that wraps around the corner; the twisted borides and bizarre landscape were a bit of a surpri se to m any of our uptight classm ates who "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"made a point of encasing the book in brown paper as a m ethod of protest—even then Peter was making waves and challenging the status quo. Peter’s painting is what brought us toge ther. W hen we were both in our junior year, the school’s Art Departm ent had a fes tiva l highligh ting the work of the stud ent body’s m ost prom inent young artists and I cam e acr oss Peter’s self-portrait in one of the display cases. “W ow, this is weird!” I comm ente d to Lori, w ho was with m e at the mom ent as she usually was, being my best friend and co-conspirator. “I know that guy—that’s Peter Gilm ore. He’s in my Social Studies class. I think he’s a Satanist, or som ething. It’s a p retty good self-portrait, because it lo oks just like him .” “I have to meet him ,” I replied. And I did m eet him. W e were m arried in 1981; Lori was m y honor attendant, and now that self-portrait hangs in our living room . As the end of high school approached, pa inting had already becom e too static an art f orm for Peter ; his interests in m usic, foreign f ilm s and the works of Ayn Rand had coalesced into a desire to tell stories on a larger scale and so upon graduation he enrolled in the film program at the School of Visual Arts. The collectivist pol itical attitudes and agendas of his professors quickly becam e apparent, and this, along w ith the necessity of comm ittee efforts in the m aking of fi lm s, quick ly convinced Peter to transfer out. Despite his lack of early training, he decided to pursue w hat had b ecom e his great passion: m usic. He began studying m usic from the ground up in a few short years had received both Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in musica l com position from New York University and began writing m usic. Peter contributed m usical introductions f or album s by the black metal band Acheron and he has created electro nic m usical scores for som e independent film productions. Several of these latter p ieces, along with oth er orig inal com positions , are collected on the album, “Threnody for Hu manity.” Peter is in the process of rebuilding his m usic studio with m odern com puter technology in anticipation of releasing his Sym phony No. 1, “Ragnarök.” So, you m ay well ask, if Peter was first an artist, then a filmmaker, and ultim ately a com poser, why is it a book of e ssays that you’re holding right now? Because Peter H. Gilm ore is also a writer. One of Peter’s f avorite a ctiv ities wh en he was growing up was taking the commuter bus with a friend down to New York City and then riding the subway up to the Am erican Museum of Na tural History to look at the dinosaur bones and other displays in this vas t and dusty old m other-lode o f biol ogical artifacts. On one occas ion, when Peter was 13, the boys returned to the Port Authority bus term inal a little too early and decided to kill som e tim e browsing the m any shops along the m ain floor. One of these was the Book Bar, a tiny bookstore sandwiched in near Teepee Town and the coffee shop, and this was wh ere Peter firs t picked up The Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey. At first Peter wante d to re ject th e paperback with its dark, fo rbidding cover and Mingesque author photo on the back, thinking that it was probably just a lot of silly, spooky language directing the reader toward so me mythical entity who prom ised to answer your prayers, or spells, or whatnot. But the black-bound tom e kept pulling him back; the very sim plicity of its title, th at lef t no roo m for misinterpretation of the author’s point-of-view, was strangely com pelling. The book went hom e with him , and the rest is history. Like so m any other Satanists before and after him, Peter read through The Satanic Bible in a single sitting and knew that he was a Satanis t. He read each subsequent book "},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"by Dr. LaVey as soon as it hit the stands. Histor ically, he was living ri ght in the m iddle of the Church of Satan’s early phases and began seeing news re ports and p rint m edia ar ticles about LaVey and his disciples. W hen The Devil’s Avenger appeared on the paperback racks, Peter bough a copy and was enthralled to learn that the m an who had changed history with his little black book, was just as interesting and colorful as Peter hoped he’d be. At 15, Peter wrote to a local Grotto. He wa s politely turned away because of his age, but was pro vided with s ome written m aterials an d encourage d to continu e his stud ies and com e back when he was old enough. He did—i n fact, we did it together in 1982 while we were both in colleg e. Our Active Ap plications w ere subm itted and accep ted in 1984, when we both felt that we m ight have som e time to contribute to the Church itself. Peter was asked to serve as a local con tact for ot her m embers becau se of his tho rough grasp of the Church and its philosophy. Then in 1986, we were ready to accept an earlier invitation to the Black H ouse on Califo rnia Street to m eet the great m an. Anton LaVey was everything we’d hoped he ’d be, and m ore. W e were treated to hours of conversation in the infam ous Purple Parlor, a m idnight tour of San Francisco from the backseat of the black Jagu ar, and an intim ate concert by this infernal keybo ard wizard in the chilly kitche n of the old Victorian house- on-the-way-to-t he-sea. And it turned out that Anton LaVey was suitabl y im pressed with us, too. W hen a m edia opportunity presented itself soon after our firs t visit to San F rancisco, Peter was asked by Dr. LaVey to represent his ideas an d his Church on national television. Thus began a career with the Church of Satan that included m edia representation on national, international, a nd local television, radio, newspapers and m agazines. This was during the turbulent heyday of the Satani c Panic, when TV talk show hosts like Geraldo were exploiting the public’s m isconcep tions about Satanism and Christian cops were m aking big bucks “educati ng” other law en forcem ent agencies with m isinform ation and outright fantasies. Peter m ade his m edia chop s fielding qu estions, accu sations, ho stile hosts and crazy religious basket-case panelist s in the furor of this m edia frenzy. His pleasant voice, ever-present hum or and com plete confidence in his knowledge of Satanic philosophy and the way Satanists apply it to th eir lives, has m ade Peter the consummate Satanic representative fo r alm ost 20 years. In this day of podcasts and Internet radio, it shows no signs of slowing down. Peter also as sisted with the adm inistration and m anagem ent of our growing organization and sent out a clarion call in 1988 w hen he founded The Bla ck Flame , the first newsstand m agazine for and by Satanists. His inte res t in explor ing th e im plicatio ns of our philos ophy, as well as presenting the id eas of other intellig ent Satan ists do ing th e sam e, sparked the need f or this jou rnal which began to draw a circle of those who would becom e our friends and co-conspirators for years to com e. In the sam e m anner that a tidal wave follows a drawing-down and receding of th e waters, a renewed cros s-fertilizatio n of ideas and projects am ong Satanists followed the Satanic Panic, m uch of it in response to The Black F lame and Blanche Barton’s books, The Secret Life of a Satanist (a new biography of LaVey) and The Church of Satan , a history of the world’s m ost notorious relig ion . Peter began writing essays to clarif y and clear up m isconceptions, to quash rum ors and mythos about our organization and its founder, and to explore areas of modern culture where o ur ideas were creati ng change and the evolution that LaVey had predicted. Many of those essays have been collected here. "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" In addition to expanding on Satanic ph ilosophy and explaining the attitudes and actions of Satanists, Peter has also explored the use of Greater Magic ov er the y ears, creating new rituals and invocations. Toge ther with our f riends, we’ve a ttem pted cerem onies in different s ettings and s paces; we’v e collaborated on carefu lly-rehea rsed and scheduled workings such as thunderous version of “Die Elektr ischen Vorspiel” as well as breaking into spontaneous rituals as the mood arose—one held in the total darkness deep in a lava tube beneath Mt. St . Helens. On the first anniversary of the passing of Anton LaVey, Peter and I organized and hosted a memorial piano concert in LaVey’s m emory, with the idea that our founde r was first and fore most a musician, and this was the best way to rem ember him in a group setting. Years later, on June 6 th , 2006, in recognition of the public’s m isconceptions about the num erical significance of this date, Peter presided over th e largest group ritual ever ce lebrated by m embers of the Church of Satan, at the Steve Allen Theater in L os Angeles. By exploiting popular cultu re’s p rejudices and fear s about the dreaded 6-6-6, our present High Priest has continued th e Church of Satan’s long histor y as the profane world’s cos mic joy buzzer. And so by reason of all of the above, this volum e contains rituals by Peter H. Gilm ore, as well as h is essays. What else can I tell you about the m an who succeeded Anton LaVey as High Priest of the Church of Sa tan, appo inted to that p osition in 2001 by High Priestess Blanche Barton? He enjoys fine wine as well as good m usic; he’s lived the m ajority of his adult life here in New York City, ta king full advantage of our proximity to the greatest con cert h alls an d class ical music venues in the world. Our livin g spaces are clogged with the evidence of a lifetim e of voracious reading and book and film collecting, along with models, toys, paintings and fi gurines of the m onst ers who occupy his im agination. He wears mostly-black, and likes red m eat; he takes wonderful care of our Chow dog, Contessa Bell Lugosi, and her coat gleam s as a result. He is a great husband—or I wouldn’t be around to celebrate 25 years of m arriage with him , and we a re definitely celebrating. But the m ost im portant thing I have to te ll you about Peter H. Gilm ore, is that he is just like any other Satanist—in one ve ry significant way. H e found Satanism on the shelf of a bookstore; the words in The Satanic B ible spoke to the very center of Peter’s dark, Satanic soul. He wasn’t born into a “tra ditio nal Satan ic f amily”; he wasn’t in itia ted by his Gran ny during th e dark of the m oon. Pete r H. Gil more is a Satanist-born because of who he is—and what he does. He’s shap ed his life and his destiny by his own wits, will and de sires—and a ccording to The Satanic B ible , we all possess th e power to do that.
