We look to the True Creator of the religion now known as “Satanism” and the Creator is Satan, himself. For far too long, enemies and outsiders have been free to define Satan and Satanism to fit their own agendas. Satan has rarely ever been allowed to speak for himself and reveal who he really is and what he is really about. Satan is a real being. He has interacted with many over the past several thousand years and he has left us his doctrines of the Al Jilwah, the Qu'ret Al Yezid and other manuscripts. He is the original Horned God. Satan does not in any way fit the Judeo/Christian or Muslim descriptions that have falsely defined him for so long, nor does he conform to the character depicted of him in Anton LaVey’s “Satanic Bible.” In order to really know Satan, one must go to him personally, without prejudice or expectations. One will find he does not conform to this or that denomination’s conceptions of “evil” which have been foolishly and thoughtlessly heaped upon him for centuries. Unfortunately, looking for answers from outside sources has been a common theme in Satanism because so much knowledge has been systematically removed and destroyed by the Christian Church. The Christian Church invented a false history to conform to their agenda, which is keeping spiritual knowledge and power in the hands of a few to the detriment of humanity. Some of the articles on this website are obsolete in light of more knowledge. Satanism is knowledge and I am endlessly involved in further research and study to uncover ancient knowledge that has been suppressed. I do my best to update this website whenever my time permits. Joy of Satan Ministries does not acknowledge or recognize Judaism, Christianity, or Islam as legitimate religions. These are in fact programs to replace spiritual knowledge with lies and corruptions, while extorting trillions upon trillions of dollars, and psychic energy, along with exploiting human misery and suffering to keep untold wealth, and spiritual knowledge and power in the hands of a \"chosen\" few. Judaism and Christianity are also extremely new, though they try to claim otherwise, with the latest major “religion” being Islam, which manifested itself less than 1,000 years ago. We find these programs have their foundations built upon stolen, corrupted teachings and practices of the older religions and have nothing of their own. We take the same stance where “Wicca” and “Neo- XX XXV XXX XXXV XL XLV L LV LX"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Paganism” are concerned as well. Both of these are latecomers (both manifesting in the 20th century) and are corrupted versions of the original religions, that conform to the Judeo/Christian agenda of enslaving the world through the removal of true spirituality. Our objectives are to enlighten people to the truth and expose all of the lies these recent so-called \"religions\" have created regarding Satan, Satanism, and Satanists. We do not recognize or acknowledge groups who characterize Satan or Satanism by Judeo/Christian concepts, or those, who like the late Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan members, do not acknowledge his existence as a real being. The information on this site is the result of much research and the personal interaction of many disciples with Satan and his Demons who have guided us and instructed us as to the truth concerning the origins of real Satanism. We encourage you to read and study freely and with an open mind. Only when one’s mind is completely free and deprogrammed, can true enlightenment and learning come about. August 23rd, 2009: The Roots and Origins of True Satanism © Copyright 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 There are different sects of Satanism. Joy of Satan Ministries is Spiritual Satanism. Satanism is not a \"Christian invention.\" Satanism predates Christianity and all other religions. Satanism is not about spooks, goblins, vampires, Halloween monsters or other related entities. Satanism is not about \"evil.\" Satanism is not a \"reaction\" to Christianity. Satanism is not about death. True Satanism is about elevating and empowering humanity, which was our True Creator (Satan's) intention. We know Satan/Lucifer as a real being. We know Satan to be the True Father and Creator God of humanity. We know \"Yaweh/Jehova\" of the bible to be a fictitious entity, and the people LXV LXX LXXV LXXX LXXXV XC XCV"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"behind coercing this lie, to be the true deceivers of humanity and the masters of lies. This is evident in the many contradictions within the Judeo/Christian Bible, revealing this text to be the work of human beings who had occult knowledge and infused it with power to make it credible, and to incite fear in order to control. We are law abiding. We DO NOT advocate or participate in any blood or living sacrifice. This act is Judeo/Christian, as stated in their Bible- Deuteronomy 12:27: \"And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.\" We have found Satanism is the original religion of humanity. We have done our research. Satanism is based upon the ancient religions that predated Judaism and Christianity from hundreds to thousands of years. Christianity was a reaction to the original Pagan religions, labeled as \"Satanism\" meaning \"enemy/adversary\" in Hebrew. If you read through the information contained within this website, we prove this. Christianity was invented to remove spiritual and occult knowledge (the powers of the mind) from the populace and place this power in the hands of a \"chosen\" few to the detriment of all humanity. The powers of the mind and soul are very real. People who are unaware of or who do not believe in these powers are easy to control and manipulate by those who are skilled in using these energies. The Original Gods [Demons] were unjustly labeled as monsters and branded as \"evil\" to keep humanity from spiritual knowledge. Because of this, the human race has drastically degenerated both spiritually and intellectually. Spiritual Satanism strongly advocates all learning, knowledge, inquiry, and free thought. Spiritual Satanism supports the separation of church and state. Satanists do not push Satanism or prosyletize. Spiritual Satanists acknowledge science and believe everything of the occult/supernatural to have a rational scientific explanation. We believe humanity has been held back dangerously in this area due to the hoax of Judeo/Christianity and its relentless attacks upon science for centuries. We practice power meditation to advance spiritually and to elevate ourselves. Power meditation is as essential for the human soul as food is essential for the human body. The serpent, a symbol of Satan represents the firey kundalini force coiled at the base of the spine, which upon ascending, transforms the human mind and soul to a much higher level of understanding and ability. This is the C CV CX CXV CXX CXXV CXXX CXXXV"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"true meaning of \"Raising the Devil.\" The Serpent symbol of Satan also represents the DNA helix of life. We work directly with Satan. We believe each and every person who is willing and respectful can have a personal relationship with Satan. There are no mediators in Spiritual Satanism; the Ministry is here only for guidance and support. We take our tenets and practices directly from Satan himself. For far too long, enemies of Satan such as the Christian churches have been at liberty to dictate lies concerning Satan and Satanism. These lies have been the foundation of occult crimes and other heinous acts that they indirectly promote. True Satanism has been actively and zealously suppressed for centuries and many out of ignorance believe lies about Satan and react accordingly. Spiritual Satanism is a life loving religion. Satan accepts us as we are, but guides us to advance ourselves to where we evolve to a higher level. Spiritual Satanists are free to live their lives as they choose- responsibility to the responsible. We live by natural law and encourage everyone to develop themselves to their fullest extent. We know we “save” our own souls as opposed to claims of the Nazarene saving anyone. Satanism is based upon the true transformation of the soul through power meditation. The Nazarene is a fictitious entity, whose identity was stolen form some 18+ crucified Pagan Gods, such as Odin, who hung from a tree and is nothing more than a tool to keep humanity under the control of a chosen few. The Nazarene has been used in Christian masses and services as a substitute for a human living blood sacrifice, revealing their true purpose. The Judeo/Christian religion is a vicious hoax on humanity of catastrophic proportions. For a hoax to succeed there has to be a lack of knowledge on the part of the victim. The Christian religion and its cohorts actively suppress knowledge and free thought, encourage people to be slaves, and never advocate or teach anything for the betterment or advancement of humanity. As opposed to the stories of how the Nazarene healed people; Satan shows us how we can heal ourselves and perform so-called miracles, using our minds and the powers of our own souls. Through empowering ourselves, we have confidence, self-respect and achieve spiritual advancement and independence. Spiritual Satanism places no limits on developing the powers of the mind- known as \"witchcraft\" or \"magick.\" We believe in justice and just as martial artists are versed in the uses of Dim Mak and other aspects of physical combat, Spiritual Satanists are versed in the Black Arts of \"magick\" should they ever need them. People who are unaware of these powers are defenseless against them, and CXL CXLV CL CLV CLX CLXV CLXX"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the powers that be know this all too well. Satan does not tolerate injustice. Spiritual Satanism does not in any way condone spirit abuse as taught in the classical grimoires. The Demons who were bound and compelled to do the bidding of the sorcerers are now free and anyone using the nine-foot circle methods and \"Jehova\" names is inviting personal disaster. The Demons are our friends and with respect and reverence in summoning through Satan, we seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships with them. Spiritual Satanism advocates individuality, liberty, and independence. It is obvious that Satan is not the \"deceiver of humanity.\" His followers have been few in number and he doesn't need copious amounts of wealth, power and control to keep his followers.  God Wanted Dead or Alive Satan For too long, so many lies and so much misinformation have been spread about Satan. Many of us have seen him, have conversed with him, and have even been astrally touched by him. Nearly all of us who know him agree concerning his appearance. RHP religions have for far too long, written the book on how they believe him to appear, how they believe Demons to look and these are nothing but blasphemous lies. He is not red with horns and a tail, nor does he look like a Halloween monster. He does not have flaming red eyes or rubbery wings. These depictions are intended to insult, denigrate, and blaspheme him. (There are some lower orders of Demons. They are protectors and messengers who serve the higher-ranking Demons). Contrary to Satanism being labeled as \"darkness,\" Satan appears wearing a long white robe identical to what he is shown wearing in the images some have seen. Many of us see him often and have a very close relationship with him. He is beautiful. His appearance is almost exactly like in the pictures, other than he rarely appears with wings. Many people have asked what Father Satan's Sigils look like: CLXXV CLXXX CLXXXV CXC CXCV CC CCV"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"• His Day is Monday. • His Colors are Blue, Red and Black He is the Sumerian God EA, also known as ENKI which means \"Lord of the Earth.\" He is also known as Melek Ta'us. • Animals that are sacred to him are the Peacock, the Serpent, the Goat, the Dragon and the Raven. • His numbers are 2 and 11 and 4. (666 is symbolic of the Age of Aquarius when he will rule again). • His Zodiac Signs are Aquarius, the Water Bearer and Capricorn, the Goat. • His Planets are Uranus and Venus (the Morning Star). • His Directions are both South and East • His most Important Day of the year is December 23, when the Sun is one degree into Capricorn. Capricorn is the 10th sign of the zodiac and the first degree of this sign makes eleven. The day following the beginning of the Winter Solstice is his Personal Day, which should be observed by every dedicated Satanist. (This was dictated directly from him, personally). THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE, THE APPLE AND THE SERPENT Edward Kelly's \"Vision of the Round House\"¹ adds further credibility to the texts written by scholars supporting the concept of the creation of humanity by extra-terrestrials through genetic engineering. There is no way Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly had any knowledge of this in the 16th century. The \"Vision of the Round House\" is identical: Humanity was created by extra- terrestrials who needed slave laborers in the mines. By taking the ovum from a Cro-Magnon/primate and using artificial insemination with a sperm from one of the Nephilim, we were created. The one known as Satan created us and designed us. He intended to bring us knowledge and make us as the Gods, but he was prevented from doing so and cursed by some of the other Gods. We did not evolve naturally, as opposed to animals who have overall better health and immunity. Satan wished to bring us to perfection, but some of the other Gods wanted for us to be destroyed after the mission was over and since we were becoming an issue, they attempted to let us all drown in the flood.

This is known as the \"Torus Stage.\" The shape is called a \"Morula.\" Every single form of life goes through this stage. This is the \"apple\" that was written about in the Garden of Eden. This is where Satan went against the other Gods and gave us more advanced genetics. The \"breath of God\" is the soul. The chakras are the psychic energy centers that are activated by BREATHING in certain ways to enable the Kundalini to ascend. When the Kundalini Serpent ascends, enlightenment/Godhead is achieved.  THE SERMONS OF SATAN Sometime ago, during a ritual, I invited Satan to speak and write through me, that I may act as medium to spread his word, enlightenment and truth. He has done so. There are times I write about things I don't even fully understand. He has been giving me wisdom and knowledge beyond anything I have ever experienced or known of. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich © Copyright 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, Joy of Satan Ministries; CCXLV CCL CCLV CCLX"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 My Conversation with Satan I have had many conversations with Father Satan and Azazel, only very few have I ever written down. Satan and his Top Ranking Demons do not usually appear face to face to most people. Those of us, who work directly with him, as he advises us and dictates instructions we are to carry out, see him face to face. Father Satan is very calm and understanding. He gives his people a sense of peace inside. He does not conform to any of the stereotypical descriptions of him. He is very unique. I have found one must get to know him for one's self. He is unlike anything I have ever read about him. Father frequently emphasized the importance of daily power meditation to me. He has also told me \"our side has won.\" Satan lost a battle a long time ago, but not the war. He has recently won the war. He is appalled at the condition of the world. To begin with, I want to fill everyone in on a couple of things so what I am about to relate will make better sense. In my studies, I have read many times of accounts of near death experiences. I was reading a book the military use of psychics.* The author, who wrote the book was a trained psychic for the US Army. He had a chapter on death and dying. He mentioned \"Hell”; what he believed to be Hell. These are the same old horror stories, where fear is used to manipulate and control due to a lack of knowledge on the part of humanity. The following is what Satan, himself had to say about it: Here is an excerpt from a conversation I had with him: I laid down as I had a mild summer cold and was not feeling very well. I thought of Azazel and before I knew it, my soul left my body and I was sitting beside him in a sort of rest area out of doors. The sky was what we would see as cloudy/light gray, there were marble blocks (alien- something we wouldn’t see here), and a marble bench I sat on beside him. In the distance was a slate colored pyramid. Before I knew it, Father Satan sat down on the other side of me, with me in the middle. He spoke to me for a while and here is an excerpt of the conversation. The words in-between the brackets [ ] are my own words; I couldn't remember his exact wording for certain parts of the conversation. Father Satan: \"Do you know why the pyramid has so much power?\" \"Because it is pointed to the sky.\" CCLXV CCLXX CCLXXV CCLXXX CCLXXXV CCXC CCXCV CCC"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"[Then, I asked him, as I was interested, though not overly concerned about the experiences of many who think what they have seen is \"Hell.\"] Father Satan: \"There are [pockets] 'vortexes' of very destructive, negative energy.\" \"Hatred, anger, fear, murder, death, and every other [destructive] thing.\" \"These are like blackholes/wormholes.\" \"They accumulate negative energy like a vaccuum.\" \"When you meditate, notice a difference?\" Maxine: \"yes.\" Father Satan: \"There are different planes of existence.\" \"When you meditate, you elevate to a higher plane.\" \"There are different levels and through meditation, you live on a higher plane than most others.\" \"People who are on an already lower level can get tied into this vortex of negative energy and pulled in.\" \"Those who [like atheists/non-believers] are on their own and are susceptible to anything.\" \"The enemy* knows how to use these.\" [When he mentioned the \"enemy\" I saw greys.] [Then, he got this sort of sad look on his face and said] \"I know, they equate that with me.\" \"There is a place here that we have for deceased souls.\" \"you have seen it.\" [This was the place I saw with the barroom and the people smoking]. \"We protect whoever comes to us.\" \"Some are [misguided] and we reincarnate them until they see the truth and are ready to come here.\" \"Most people [those who are without as well] get reincarnated.\" Azazel is disgusted with the \"degeneration of the human soul.\" [At the base chakra, human beings have been sealed off from energy.

This is analogous to tying off a limb and allowing no blood or lymph to circulate and leaving it to wither and die. This has been the case with the human soul, which “Yaweh” has sealed off from kundalini energy. Our souls have drastically degenerated. Bringing up the kundalini serpent is very difficult and dangerous as we are used to operating on a very low level of bioelectricity.] Azazel told me \"10,000 years ago,\" we were \"close to perfection.\" We lived side by side with the Gods. \"The Earth was attacked.\" *(Reference to the mistaken concept of Hell) The Seventh Sense by Lyn Buchanan ©2003 © Copyright 2003, 2005, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457  Name of Satan After several years of intense and extensive research, it has all come together. 1. The bible was invented in order to keep esoteric knowledge and mind/soul power in the hands of a select few. 2. Christianity, which began with the Catholic Church, was invented to physically enforce the above and also, to destroy and to replace the original religions. The original religions centered around the reverence for the serpent. The serpent is the symbol of the kundalini. The \"Tree of Knowledge\" is really the map of the human soul. It is seen in nearly every ancient religion pre-dating Judeo/Christianity. The trunk symbolizes the spine, and the branches symbolize the chakras and the kundalini pathways. There are 144,000 nadis (channels for the kundalini life force) within the human soul. The Buddah sat beneath the \"Bo Tree\" and achieved enlightenment. \" Bo means serpent, as in Bo-A or Boo-Ta.\" ¹ The Christian Church stole, twisted and corrupted everthing they could from the original religions. The fig tree was known as \"The Tree of Wisdom\" Ficus religiosa. ² The xian church corrupted this with the placing of fig leaves over the genitals of Adam and Eve. 3. \"Satan\" in Hebrew means \"enemy\" and \"adversary.\" Now, the word \"Satan\" goes back much, much further than the Hebrew definition. Note in the upper northwest corner of the map of India, the name of the town \"Satana.\" CCCXXXV CCCXL CCCXLV CCCL CCCLV CCCLX CCCLXV CCCLXX"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"\"Satnam\" and \"Sa Ta Na Ma\" are sacred mantras used in kundalini (serpent) meditation. The five primal sounds in Ancient Sanskrit, one of the oldest known languages are \"SA-TA-NA-MA.\" \"Sa\" means infinity; Ta means life; Na means death; and Ma means rebirth. All variations of the name \"SATAN\" mean TRUTH in Sanskrit, which is one of the world's oldest and most ancient of languages. All of this has to do with the kundalini life force (the serpent) within us. \"Jacob's coat of colors\" in the bible is the aura. The number seven is the chakras. The interpreters of the old grimoires have it all wrong about the \"seven planets.\" The ancients knew much more than given credit for regarding astronomy. Anyone familiar with Chinese medicine and advanced martial arts is aware of the chi (the life force, same as the kundalini) and how it is more active in certain pathways in the body on certain days and hours. I uploaded a chart to the meditations section for this. The authors of alchemy texts in those days put their writings in codes in order to escape persecution by the church. The sun was another object of veneration for the original religions. This was because of the pure, raw power it bestowed and as it is the source of all life. Drawing down the moon or absorbing energy from the stars is nothing compared to what can be done under the sun, given the knowledge and training. JoS clergy members know this. Holes in the aura are healed and the life force is amplified as with no other source of light. \"Lucifer\" was also given to our beloved Father as a name. Lucifer was originally a Roman God with no connection to our Father Satan/Ea. The prefix \"Luc\" has to do with light. The soul needs light. The morning star, Venus, was a source of light for the ancients as its rising preceded the all-important sun. Venus also rules the important heart chakra. Father Satan (I prefer to call him Satan, personally), told me he has no problem with people calling him by the names he has been known by for centuries, even though they are inaccurate. I call him Father Satan whenever I communicate with him or thank him for something. To me \"Satan\" will always mean \"adversary,\" adversary to the enemy lie of Judeo/Christianity. The Catholic Church knew the original religions had to be replaced with something else and this is where all of the stories in the bible came from. They are all rip-offs from the originals, which had their origins long before Judeo/Christianity ever reared its ugly head. The Virgin Mary stole from and replaced Astaroth, who was bound, as \"the Lady of Heaven.\" Astaroth was the most popular Goddess in the pre- Christian world. Fictitious Jehova ripped off from Enlil/Beelzebub/Baal, who was the most popular God in the pre-Christian world, and then there is our beloved Creator Father Satan/Ea who wound up as the Serpent CCCLXXV CCCLXXX CCCLXXXV CCCXC CCCXCV CD CDV CDX CDXV"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"and the Devil. Sexuality, which is the primary aspect of the life force, automatically came under intense scrutiny by the church. Orgasm directly stimulates the kundalini serpent the base of the spine. The creative energy needed to produce another human life can be used to revamp one's life force which advances and empowers one's soul. Obviously sexual activity could not be prohibited, so fear was used to place it under strict regulation. In the xian religions, especially the Catholic Church of old, all sexual pleasure was sinful and prohibited by the church. Intercourse was only to produce children and nothing more. Nakedness became a sin because it led to lust. Masturbation was another \"mortal sin.\" Anything that had to do with the raising of the kundalini was severely attacked by the church. The sole purpose of the Christian Church was for the removal of knowledge and nothing more. While the masses have been stripped of this knowledge and power, a select few who have worked to remove this knowledge use it liberally to enslave the unknowing world. The Jesuit assassins of the Catholic Church are known to even levitate as they draw off of the psychic power from the prayers of their unknowing vicitms. ¹Cloak of the Illuminati by William Henry, 2003 ² Ibid.

Fools claim Satan is an \"xian invention.\" All of the Old Gods were made into Devils and Demons in order to destroy their relations with humans. These are the Gods who have been present throughout the life of the human race and have attempted to give us knowledge and to help us in our times of need. Cities were destroyed, libraries and other places where books were kept were burnt and destroyed. Every culture, such as the Philistines, that worshiped other Gods was made war upon and genocide ensued. The Philistines worshiped Beelzebub. he was the God of the Philistine city of Ekron and Zebulon. (Baal [Lord] Zebulon). There are few if any traces of the truth concerning these Gods. The Old Gods have remained as Devils and Demons just to survive. The judeo/xian \"god\" wishes for the destruction of humanity.

We are aware of the existence of Satan/Lucifer as an actual being. We are not atheists! In spite of major discrepancies, the Church of Satan, founded 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, presently takes an atheistic stance as far as external deities are concerned, and views Satan as only an “archetype.” In light of new knowledge based upon hundreds of hours of intense and in-depth research, we have discovered the following: 1. Satan is our True Creator God. \"YHVH\" otherwise known as \"Jehova\" by the deluded, is a false entity. \"YHVH\" stands for the four elements and corners in the popular Jewish systems of magick that are available to the public. 2. The character \"Jesus Christ\" is fictitious and was stolen from some 18+ Pagan legends of a God hanging from a tree, such as Odin, then being resurrected, and is another description of the alchemical operation of transforming the soul- death and then resurrection. The nazarene is and has never been anything more than a tool to remove all true spiritual knowledge and disarm the populace of their spiritual powers. Humanity has paid to the tune of trillions upon trillions of dollars, and with sickness, misery, and suffering due to the removal of this knowledge. Spiritual knowledge was systematically destroyed, twisted, and corrupted to SPIRITUALLY AND FINANCIALLY ENSLAVE US ALL. By force-feeding the populace that the Nazarene is a real entity, those at the top have maintained control and have reaped untold wealth and power. 3. True Satanism preceded Christianity by thousands of years and is based upon total transformation of the soul. Christians are deluded into \"accepting Jesus Christ\" and \"living saved\" which is all false. Everything in the Christian religion is false and we prove this beyond all doubts. The Christian \"saved\" hoax is based upon stolen and corrupted knowledge of alchemy, where one truly works spiritually to transform one's soul into godhead. Many Traditional Satanists worship Satan/Lucifer. Some acknowledge him as a friend and do not worship. We respect individuality and personal choices. One's relationship with Satan/Lucifer is up to the individual, as Satanism values free thought and individuality. Satan is the bringer of knowledge. The goal of Spiritual Satanism is to apply this knowledge and transform our souls into godhead, as was originally intended by our Creator God Satan. Unlike most religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages one to question everything. Being one's personal best and exceeding limitations are the essence of Spiritual Satanism and this begins with using one's brains to their maximum potential.

We strongly encourage our people to interact one on one with Satan. The ministry is here for guidance and support only. One's relationship with Satan is between that individual and Satan. We take the stance of \"responsibility to the responsible.\" We place no limitations on knowledge or personal power and do everything we can to make all knowledge available to EVERYONE- not just a select few who are a self-appointed \"elite\" as with other religions. Satan encourages self-study, learning, direct experience. Most Spiritual Satanists make a commitment to Satan. The commitment is very important because Satan protects us as we work to advance our powers. Those who go it alone or without any spiritual protection often meet with disaster. Once one makes a commitment, Demons often guide us and work with us to help us advance. Unlike right hand path religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages action. Satan wants his people to live life to the fullest and to evolve. Satan is always there for us, but as we progress, he expects us to handle things, as we are able to, for ourselves, using our own powers. Christianity and its cohorts deliberately make cripples out of people. Christians forever rave about how their Nazarene has healed people. These people remain as slaves because they are never taught how to, nor are they required to heal themselves or others. The Nazarene archetype stands for slavery, servitude, and enduring endless abuse in order to program humanity to be the perfect slaves in a new world order. The Nazarene places total emphasis on the \"afterlife\" in order to create the mindset that the life we are now living does not matter. This frame of mind is essential for enduring all kinds of abuse for the benefit of a few. \"It has served us well, this myth of Christ\" -Pope Leo X (1475-1521) As for the so-called \"miracles\" connected with Christianity, any healings have been very few and far in-between. These are also based upon allegories related to transforming one's soul. Any human being with spiritual knowledge and power can accomplish all of the feats attributed to the nazarene in the bible, and more.

Many people disregard so-called “occult” power, they do not take it seriously or are otherwise completely ignorant concerning it. The truth is, occult power has been in the hands of a few for centuries. Christianity has been their tool for removing this knowledge from the populace. Following the removal of knowledge, a fictitious past was invented to keep people from knowing the truth. People who do not understand or are unfamiliar with these skills are at the mercy of those who have them and who are adept at using them. Thousands of years ago in Ancient Egypt, this power was well known and most of the populace knew how to use it. With the arrival of Judeo/Christianity and Islam, knowledge was systematically destroyed wherever it was found. Cities, libraries, and any other sources of knowledge were destroyed in an attempt to annihilate all knowledge of the Original Gods [who are extraterrestrials] and the powers of the human soul. The Gods who interacted with, intermarried or befriended humanity were cursed and banished. Humanity has been cut off from our True Creator God Satan and has devolved ever since. The abuse of children, animals, careless destruction and disregard for the environment, the earth, and other living creatures are some of the effects of spiritual degeneration. Thousands of years ago, long before the coming of Judeo/Christianity, humans lived side by side with the Gods in the era known as \"The Golden Age.\" Satan is the Sumerian God known as \"EA\" or \"ENKI.\" He is a GOD, not an angel! He has been denigrated and slandered through the centuries with falsehoods and lies. Most people do not know Satan. They believe everything they are told about him without question. Fear is a powerful tool that has been used for centuries to keep humanity away from Satan. Satan is the most brilliant and powerful of the Gods.

Aquarius is the sign of humanity, technology and genius. One of Satan's numbers is 11. Satan/Enki established the Ancient Egyptian Order of the Serpent, also known as \"The Brotherhood of the Snake.\" Through the millennia, the teachings have been corrupted and no longer resemble the original doctrines. This Order was to bring humanity godly knowledge and power and to complete the Great Work of transforming our souls. This knowledge has been kept in the hands of a few and abused to the detriment of us all under the direction of the enemy gods. People are told if they are given this power, they will abuse it. This is another lie created and spread by those who deliberately use these powers for nefarious ends under the direction of the enemy extraterrestrials masquerading as “jehova” and company. To reveal these well-kept secrets to the average person would assure that those in control would no longer retain their power. The Gods are an extra-terrestrial humanoid race of beings. In the Christian bible, they are referred to as the \"Nephilim.\" These beings are very evolved, highly advanced, and immensely knowledgable and powerful. They genetically modified their DNA, so they do not age. In the Simon version of the Necronomicon (this book is based upon Mesopotamian/Sumerian mythology, even though classified as a work of fiction), the phrase: \"When the Great Bear hangs low in the sky\" refers to the constellation Ursa Major, part of the Big Dipper. When the planets align a certain way, it opens up a travel line for space travelers. People are always looking to the sky for when the Gods will return. Humanity’s sole purpose was for use as slave laborers in the mines for the Nephilim. We were to be destroyed after the gold mining project was completed. Satan, along with many of the Nephilim fathered children with human mothers. These offspring were known as \"Demi-Gods.\" Satan is incredibly strong, brilliant, and powerful. He refused to admit defeat. He lost a battle, but not the war. SATAN/LUCIFER STANDS FOR FREEDOM FROM TYRANNY! DOES SATAN REALLY EXIST? Yes. He interacts with his Disciples and followers. Many of us have seen him, we have witnessed the so-called supernatural, and we have been given abilities way beyond that of the average person. When we ask, we get answers. Unlike other religions, where followers have to go searching for their gods, Satan/Lucifer comes to us. He lets us know of his presence. Demons, as opposed to all of the Christian lies, are friends of humanity. Demons, who are the Original Gods, give us much individual attention and protection, once a strong and trusted relationship is established.

Their Sigils contain very important designs of alchemical symbols related to the opening of the soul. Satan is not \"evil,\" nor is Satan responsible for the multitude of illnesses, diseases, or anything else that afflicts humanity. These afflictions are due to the removal and destruction of ancient knowledge that was replaced with the Christianity programs. Satanism stands for the balance of spirituality with technology. Without this balance, civilizations eventually collapse. “ Hell” is not a burning lake of fire. Hell is not inside the Earth, as some foolish Christians claim in order to frighten people. The Christian concept of Hell is very ludicrous. Some of us, who are close to Satan, have seen “Hell.” We all seem to have had the same experiences. Some places in Hell are dark and illuminated by a blue light, and in other places, there is daylight. One of Lucifer's colors is blue and Demons often appear with a blue light. Blue is a very spiritual color. I saw people sitting around a table in a bar in Hell, playing cards. The room was smoke filled, these people, already being dead, could smoke to their hearts content. These people were in spirit form. Some visit the earth to help humans who are on the Left Hand Path. This is where Satan keeps his own people until we can reincarnate and evolve into godhead. \"Hell\" and the \"Lower world\" are also allegories for the three lower chakras; \"Hell\" representing the base chakra. The reason for this is the fiery kundalini serpent lies coiled beneath the base chakra and when roused, it can be scorching hot. As opposed to hysterical Christian claims, Satanism is not in any way about blood sacrifice. All kinds of murder and living blood sacrifices can be seen all throughout the Judeo/Christian bible. The serpent/snake, which symbolizes Satan, represents the kundalini at the base of the spine, also the DNA. The serpent represents life. When this force is activated, we are healed and enlightened.

There are millions of other cases of Jewish ritual murder, but here is a comprehensive list that covers from the years before the common era to 1932.

In the intervening period numerous attempts were made to lead the investigating officers on to the wrong track. Meanwhile a large number of incriminating witnesses suffered sudden and unnatural deaths; false accusations and confessions followed one after another due to huge money bribes. Behind the accused lurking in the shadows, was the figure of Faivel Schneerson of the Lubavitchers, leader of the 'Zadiks' ('Saints') of the Chassidim sect, who was the spiritual director of the murder. The trial ended with the release of Beiliss, but at the same time the court established that the murder had taken place inside the Jewish brickyard, which was the religious center of the Kiev Jews, for the purpose of obtaining blood.

The Truth About So-called \"Murdered Infants,\" The Knights Templar and the Uses of Body Fluids in Magickal Practices Anyone who has studied Ancient Sumerian/Mesopotamian Mythology knows how distorted these legends became when they ended up as the foundation for the Judeo/Christian Bible. Much of the practices of the Knights Templar were also twisted into bizarre stories in order to convict and murder members of the Order on the grounds of heresy, along with so many others in their day. The Knights Templar originated in 1119 supposedly to “safeguard pilgrims” on their journeys to and from the Holy Land. There is a lot of controversy concerning this notion because there were only nine knights to begin with, and it has become known, they had specific instructions to dig beneath the Temple of Solomon. This became their primary center in Jerusalem on the site that is now occupied by \"The Dome of the Rock.\" Within a few decades following the excavation, the Templars grew into several thousand, and traveled extensively. Through this, they were initiated into various esoteric teachings, beliefs, and practices that survived outside of Europe and the control of the Christian Church. The Order grew from the founding number of nine to number in the thousands, and within a short period of time because of certain stipulations, they became very wealthy and influential, holding a large number of properties and banking houses both in Europe and abroad. What the original members discovered beneath Dome of the Rock is open MCCCL MCCCLV MCCCLX MCCCLXV MCCCLXX MCCCLXXV MCCCLXXX MCCCLXXXV"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"to much speculation. Most scholars agree the Templars unearthed many ancient documents that revealed the Nazarene as a ficitious character. Other accounts and historical evidence point to the excavators further discovering that the Judeo/Christian \"God\" is the real \"Devil\" and that \"God\" and the \"Devil\" were reversed. Historically following this event, grimoires and so-called \"black books\" manifested in an illiterate Europe. From my extensive studies and research concerning the Knights Templars and the history of this period, I have come to the conclusion the excavators discovered documents containing instructions for spirit abuse. It is more than obvious the Catholic Church made ample use of these, exploiting Demons in erecting a plethora of ornate Gothic (Goetic) cathedrals and other structures that defy all rational explanation, given the widespread ignorance and illiteracy of the times. The order soon acquired extreme wealth. Many scholars attributed their advancement to their worship of the gilded Head of Baphomet. The idol was believed to have the power of creating wealth, causing trees to flourish and the earth to become fruitful. They were accused of anointing the head with \"the fat of murdered infants.\" THIS WAS NOT FAT FROM MURDERED INFANTS AS THE CHURCH PERVERTED, AND TWISTED THE INFORMATION. THIS \"FAT FROM 'MURDERED INFANTS'\" WAS SEMEN. In the Judeo/Christian Bible, when a man \"spills his seed,\" he is accused of murdering [potential] children (GEN 38: 9-10). Semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, blood, and other body fluids were traditionally used in ancient religious rites as standard procedure. These fluids contain the life force, and when used by knowledgeable practitioners or priests, energy can be directed and applied to accomplishing specific objectives in the material world. The Catholic Church's sole purpose was to remove any and all knowledge of the Ancient Gods, and religions that pre-dated Judeo/Christianity. A fictitious past was invented and to ensure this past would survive, anyone with knowledge of the truth was labeled as a \"heretic\" and condemned to torture and death. Accounts of ancient religious rites were perverted and warped by the Catholic Clergy to justify mass murder and to create an atmosphere of terror that is so necessary for control of the populace. The Christian Church twisted the ancient religious uses of body fluids into “murdering infants in the name of Satan.” This is false and has like so many other lies, evolved into taking on a life of its own, bringing accusations, murder, and slander upon Satanists and Pagans. Because most ancient knowledge was removed, warped and twisted, the church was at liberty to dictate what Satanism was all about to an unknowing populace. This sort of thing over the centuries has driven certain people who could no longer tolerate the sick anti-life religion of Christianity to apply the MCCCXC MCCCXCV MCD MCDV MCDX MCDXV MCDXX MCDXXV MCDXXX"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"cultural concept of \"evil\" to Satan and engage in occult crimes, believing this to be of Satan. The church has made ample use of these accounts over the centuries to further their agenda of lies. The Knights Templar leaders did worship the Baphomet and renounce the Nazarene. In all probability from extensive travels in the Middle East, they more than likely learned the truth through interaction with the Yezidis and other peoples who kept the ancient ways. The magickal practices involving the regular use of body fluids and the use of semen in anointing the head, were acquired by the Templars from eastern sources of sex magick and tantric worship. Christianity had not yet infested these areas to remove the knowledge and replace it with lies. Another area these stories originated later on and grew into a life of their own was from some of the old grimoires. These writings would instruct the mage to \"sacrifice a kid.\" A \"kid\" is a young goat, NOT a human being! These grimoires are NOT of Satan. They are tools that were used to exploit the Original Gods who lost a battle in a war and had their powers taken from them. Warfare between advanced civilizations is spiritual and involves the soul. Charges against 231 knights ranged from blasphemy and Devil worship to sodomy and other so-called \"sins.\" Because of the wealth and power retained by the order, they had become a threat to the Catholic Church. King Phillip IV of France owed the Templars a considerable sum of money and was facing financial devastation. He conspired with the pope to arrest Grand Master Jacques de Molay and many other members of the Order. A significant number of members escaped and took up residence on pirate ships or remained as fugitives. Their underground organization of fraternal aid in keeping members of the Order alive and hidden form the Inquisition evolved into \"Freemasonry.\"¹ Both the Christian church and Phillip IV were able to confiscate the property and holdings of the Templars following the arrests and murders by the Inquisition and the disbandment of the remaining members of the order. Grand Master Jacques de Molay, burning at the stake, cursed the Catholic Pope and Phillip IV, that both would die within a year, they both did. ¹Born in Blood: the Lost Secrets of Freemasonry by John J.

Freedom fighters and the government are constantly battling the xian church that is forever a continuous threat to the lives and liberties of others. Once children are ensnared, they are abused, raped, molested and psychologically destroyed, and in some cases, even mutilated and murdered. In the least, they will never live up to or acknowledge their full potential. Xians are forever trying to wrest control of the legal system, perverting it, like they do everything else, using it as another instrument to deny ALL of us our freedom, to enslave everyone, destroy lives and ruin what others have sacrificed everything for.

Along with literature, theatre, and art, the xian church has always regarded music with great suspicion, when it wasn't completely under their strict and oppressive control. Satan is master of the violin and flute. 18th century Italian composer Giuseppe Tartini was inspired when Satan appeared to him in a dream. He heard Satan playing the violin. He said it was the most beautiful music he had ever heard. It was \"indescribably beautiful.\" He immediately awoke and tried to write it down to copy it, but it never turned out the same way. He did the best he could to duplicate it. He published it and named it \"The Devil's Trill.\" 19th century violinist Niccolo Paganini came under intense suspicion of \"collaborating with the Devil.\" In other words, no one could write or play anything so beautiful without help from Satan. Here the xian church indirectly admits that the beauty of Satan outshines what they worship. Modest Mussorgsky composed \"A Night On Bald Mountain.\" The music portrayed a witches’ sabbat. In the original piece, Satan reigned triumphant at the climax, but this was too much for Mussorgsky's xian contemporaries. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov revised it, ending the piece with the ringing of a church bell. Satan also inspired Carl Orff in his dreams when he wrote \"Carmina Burana.\" This music is best known from the soundtrack of the movie, \"The Omen.\" Orff told his wife that he saw Demons many times in his dreams when he composed the music. Jazz is synonymous with Satan. The rhythmic beat, the dances the music inspires, and of course, it opened the door to rock and roll. Music has always been a great friend to humanity. Music is a tension reliever, as it relaxes the left (logical) side of the brain so that the creative right side can manifest itself in new ideas and solutions to things, in the same way meditation helps us. Satan can speak to us through the music. Music makes any activities more pleasant. Work becomes easier, a fast beat can get one going, a soothing beat can calm one's mood, and sexual intercourse to music can be blissful. William Blake once stated that all true poetry was the \"work of the Devil.\" Satan inspires creativity. He works to bring out creativity in all of his disciples. With Satan, we learn and grow as individuals. Each one of us is unique.

What they fail to see is how their own so-called \"religion\" and bible have always been and are the roots of and blueprint for this regime. Everything in the Judeo/Christian Bible has been stolen and corrupted from religions predating Judaism, Christianity, and Islam from hundreds to thousands of years. Through Judaism and its tool of Christianity, all of the original spiritual teachings from around the world, (which are CONCEPTS) have been stolen from, lumped together into the \"one,\" and corrupted into Jewish archetypes and characters and fictitious places. This has given the Jewish people as a whole a false history, political power and \"spiritual\" authority to which they are not entitled. The bible is a very powerful subliminal tool to control the masses. One can see this is a man-made work as there are endless contradictions. The bible has been systematically drummed into the minds of the populace from a very early age. A lie must always be enforced as opposed to the truth which can stand on its own. Because spiritual knowledge and occult power have been removed and kept in the hands of a \"chosen\" few, the unknowing populace has been helpless against it. The agenda here is to create a one-world slave state with the \"chosen\" few ruling at the top. The perpetrators of course blame Satan to create a necessary distraction, while they use occult power to accomplish their ends. They have a history of stealing from and blaming their enemies for everything they really are and do, while always holding themselves in the highest esteem and innocence. The original religions now known as \"Satanism\" (by the way, \"Satan\" means \"enemy\" in Hebrew), were all based upon what is known as the \"Magnum Opus\" or Great Work. The one known as \"Satan\" is our True Creator God. He was prevented by the other Gods from finishing his work on humanity, that of the godhead. The godhead is physical and spiritual perfection. The era in which the original religions reigned was known as the \"Golden Age.\" Some 10,000 years ago, the Gods left us. This article is not to go into the details as to how or why. This will be covered in a separate article. The Gods are an extraterrestrial race of beings. As a matter of fact, there have been several different alien races that have lived here on planet Earth, and have taken an interest in human beings, either as friends, enemies, or neutrals. The main Gods who interacted with humanity and are our creators (through genetic engineering) are the race of Gods known as the Nordics. They live throughout the galaxy in several different solar systems. They are highly advanced in knowledge, intelligence, and in spirit. Some are helpful to humans as are Satan and the Elder Gods who have been labeled as “Demons.” Some are neutral and others are and have been working for our destruction.

In many writings of a spiritual or occult nature, the term \"God\" or \"Gods\" was also used to describe the seven chakras. Due to centuries of persecution of those who had spiritual knowledge, doctrines contained many allegories and code words. The number \"seven\" is repeated endlessly in the Judeo/Christian bible. This is a corruption of the seven chakras of the soul. The original cross was equal armed, as seen in many of the Demon Sigils, with the points (representative of the chakras) flaring out. Other well-known examples are the Nazi Iron Cross and the Bikers' cross. In truth, this is the shape of the human soul, and represents the four elements (fire, earth, air and water) of which the human soul is comprised. The number four was stolen and corrupted in the Judeo/Christian Bible as with the number seven, the most blatant example being the four gospels. The Tarot, which originated in Egypt and is based upon the constellations (Egypt was the center of Spiritual Alchemy) has evolved into a deck of cards, of which modern playing cards originated after the trump was discarded. The Tarot has a hidden message and instructions for performing the Magnum Opus. From the Tarot, the Jewish invented \"Torah\" was stolen, with the original teachings being thoroughly corrupted. The Jewish \"Torah\" is also known as \"The Five Books of Moses\" (another fictitious Jewish character based upon Sargon and Thutmose) or the \"Pentateuch.\" The five books were rip-offs from the five suits of the Tarot: Wands/Rods (the element of fire), Pentacles/Coins (the element of earth), Cups (the element of water) and Swords (the element of air), with the trump being the aether or quintessence. All five elements form the essence of the human soul (the fifth element of quintessence holds the four together) and are employed in the working of the Magnum Opus. Each of the Jewish characters and archetypes in the Bible are imposters stolen from Pagan Gods. \"Jesus\" is NOT a real being, but a CONCEPT. For those deluded Christians who believe they have experienced \"Jesus\" in reality, they are communing with nefarious extraterrestrial beings. Aleister Crowley while in a trance state, drew a picture of what is known to be \"Jehova\" (a corruption of \"YHVH\" another rip-off of the four quarters and elements, making the 'name' pronouncable) and drew a grey. At that time, knowledge of ET's was not widespread and photos of them were non-existent. These same beings are said to have made a deal with the Vatican: souls in exchange for wealth and power in the hands of a few. To accomplish this end, all spiritual knowledge had to be removed. No scam can succeed if the victim has knowledge. In order to be effectively victimized, one must be unknowing. Satan is the bringer of knowledge and enlightenment. He has nothing to hide.

The 33 years he was said to have lived represent the 33 vertebrae of the human spine of which the kundalini ascends. The crucifixion symbolizes the Magnum Opus: the torture, the death, and the resurrection. Origins that symbolize this work include the Egyptian phoenix (born again from the ashes), the Egyptian God Set, who was crucified on a furka, the tale of Isis and Osiris, where Osiris was mutilated into some nine parts and was resurrected by Isis. The Jewish \"Virgin Mary\" is a corrupted imposter of Astaroth. Michael the archangel is the same and was stolen from Marduk. Archangel \"Gabriel\" was stolen from the Egyptian God Thoth, Raphael was stolen from Azazel and Uriel from Beelzebub. Again, another rip-off of the four quarters. For further information, links are provided at the bottom of this article. Human sexuality has always been severely regulated and frowned upon by the Christian Church. This is because sexuality and orgasm as the life force are essential to spiritual advancement and the raising of the kundalini serpent. Because the church could not supervise sexual activity, they enforced a doctrine of extreme terror. The populace, stripped of all knowledge and spiritual power (ignorance= fear) fell victim to lies. “Hell” emerged on the scene. The word “Hell” was stolen from the Norse word “Hel” representing the Norse underworld. In truth, \"Heaven\" and \"Hell\" are code-words for the base and crown chakras. Every attempt was made by the church to replace any spiritual associations with these numbers and any significant numbers that were related to the human soul such as 144,000, which is the number of nadis within the human body to channel the life force. The number two became synonymous with Satan. The second chakra is sexual in nature and controls human sexuality, so of course any association with two was evil. Blockages in the second chakra keep an individual completely enslaved spiritually as the life force remains completely dormant in the first chakra. With fear, human beliefs and thoughts can be controlled. Humanity was led to believe this omnipresent and “all-powerful” “God” could know their every little thought and action. Through fear, people began to monitor their own thoughts and actions. The seven sacraments (another rip-off of the seven chakras) of the Catholic Church enforced strict control over every stage of an individual’s life. The most control was exercised through the so-called \"sacrament\" of “confession.” Through confession, the church had even more control, that of knowing the deepest secrets of the frightened population. This enabled the ruling clergy to have power over kings, queens and other secular monarchy.

Upon researching the origins of various myths and religions, I find many authors are at a disagreement, both religious and secular. This is due to the Christian Church's systematic destruction and removal of ancient knowledge. To make matters worse, many of the remaining original documents that escaped destruction have been altered. The Gods left us the truth, inscribed in stone. The pyramids (the pyramids are in the shape of the chakras) have stood against time. It is apparent these ancient monoliths were constructed for future humanity, left to us by the Gods who knew of our fate. These monuments speak for themselves. They were built to reflect the movements of the stars and act as a calendar for beginning the all-important work of the Magnum Opus. The Magnum Opus is normally commenced in the spring, when the Sun enters the sign of Aries, which is known as the \"Vernal Equinox.\" The precise time for beginning this work is at 3 am, which is the hour of Satan. This is the true hour. The fictitious nazarene was said to have perished at 3 pm. 3 pm is actually 15:00, not three and is thus false. The \"Horned God\" originates to Sumeria. The Sumerian Gods wore headgear with horns. This predates Judeo/Christianity by thousands of years. Pagan religions were known for their worship of the Horned God. Only with the coming of Christianity, were they repeatedly stamped out, but continued to resurface and survive. Again, the Horned God was maligned and labeled as \"evil. The Horned God is a symbol of the the chi, the bioelectrical life-force. This is represented by Mercury, as it is fleeting, until fixed through the Magnum Opus. The glyph for the planet Mercury has the horns. The carvings and the hieroglyphics on the Temple walls and the pyramids still remain with us today, as evidence of the truth for those who have enough spiritual knowledge to interpret them. This is why the Gods imprinted these into stone. Satanism is based upon the Magnum Opus. All of the Satanic symbols, the emphasis on witchcraft and knowledge; all of these represent the achievement of the godhead. The Magnum Opus is what Satanism is all about: humanity reaching physical and spiritual perfection. ¹ Cassel Dictionary of Witchcraft by David Pickering, article on \"Germany\", page 108 The Lost Book of Enki; Memiores of an Extra-Terrestrial God by Zecharia Sitchin Satan Wants You by Arthur Lyons, pp 24-26 The Biography of Satan by Kersey Graves, pp 146- 147 MDCCLXV MDCCLXX MDCCLXXV MDCCLXXX MDCCLXXXV MDCCXC MDCCXCV MDCCC"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The People of the Sea- The Search for the Philistines by Trude and Moshe Dothan, pp 185- 186  Satanic Meditation \"Fools do not know what they are doing.

The active left side of the brain blocks out any attempts to access the passive right side where the seat of the unconscious is. This is analagous to turning off the electricity to a room or a building in order to fix the wiring. The right side of the brain is where we can program our minds to manifest what we want in reality. To get into a trance state takes practice. Remember, each of us is individual and some may find this easier than others. The important thing is to be persistent and patient with yourself. Persistence and consistency are everything here. Performing breathing exercises before trance is highly recommended, as this will naturally calm the nervous system. 1. Sit comfortably. Do not lie down because you might fall asleep. 2. Breathe in for a count of six, hold for a count of six and then exhale for a count of six. Do this breathing until you are completely relaxed. Ideally, you should no longer be able to feel your body. 3. Imagine you are climbing down a ladder in the dark. Don’t visualize a ladder; just imagine you can feel yourself doing it. On the exhale, feel yourself climbing a step or two down the ladder. On the inhale, feel yourself holding still on the ladder.

If you get dizzy or disoriented, just bring your attention to the front of your body and this will stop. This mental falling effect, when combined with deep relaxation and mental calmness, will cause you to enter the trance state. What is needed is a mental falling effect inside your mind. This changes the level of brain wave activity from the awake level (Beta) to the asleep level (Alpha) or the deep sleep level (Theta). Once your level of brain wave activity reaches Alpha you will enter a trance. Once you get the heavy feeling, stop the mental falling exercise. If you don’t like the ladder, imagine you are in a lift [elevator], feel yourself falling on the exhale and holding on the inhale. Or, Imagine you are a feather, feel yourself floating down on the exhale and holding still on the inhale. You need a mental falling effect to lower your level of brain wave activity. 5. Keep doing this for as long as it takes. The time it takes to enter trance will vary, depending on your experience with deep relaxation and mental calmness. A trance feels like: Everything gets quieter and you feel like you are in a much bigger place. There is a very slight humming feeling in your body. Everything feels different. It feels a bit like putting a cardboard box over your head in the dark, you can feel the atmosphere change. It’s like everything goes fuzzy or slightly blurred. Any sharp noises, while in trance are painful. 6. To bring yourself out of the trance: Concentrate on moving your fingers or toes. Once you can move a finger or toe, flex your hands, move your arms, shake your head, i.e., reanimate your body; and get up and walk around for a few minutes. What this exercise does: In order to advance in psychic power, we must train our minds. When we are in a trance state, our brain waves slow down considerably. There are two sides to the brain- the left logical/intellectual masculine side and the right creative/intuitive feminine side. The right side is the seat of the subconscious. This is the area of the mind that is open to suggestion and programming and the seat of our astral power. When the left side of our brain is active in thinking, the right side cannot be accessed. Trance states shut off the left side so we can access and program the right side (subconscious). It takes training to be able to induce a deep trance state. Deep trance states are not always necessary, but for specific workings, they are very important.

Being startled and pulled out of a trance the wrong way can be extremely painful and the pain can last for days, especially if you are doing energy work in this state. It is normal when in a trance state for any sounds to be very painful. This is because in this state, our senses are extremely heightened.

Exhale and visualize the energy expanding your aura 4. Breathe in again and visualize the energy getting brighter and more powerful, radiating from your entire being. 5. Exhale again and visualize the energy expanding your aura, and the center of your body shining brilliantly like the sun. 6. Repeat this several times, each time visualizing the energy becomeing brighter and brighter as it increases in intensity. When working with colors, visualize the color becoming more and more powerful and vibrant. You will notice each color has a different feel to it.

Sound Meditation The benefits of meditating on sounds are the opening of more pathways within the brain. Any sounds can be used for this meditation. This includes any kind of music. Close your eyes and relax. Open your mind and try to 'see' the sounds. Sounds usually come in motion and in specific shapes, colors and waves. The ability to see sounds is called “synesthesia.” “Synesthesia” is a medical term for those of us who are born with the ability to see sounds and/or experience different senses at the same time, like hearing colors or tasting/smelling shapes. A small percentage of the population were born with synesthesia. It often fades with age and in most cases is pronounced during childhood. The experience of seeing sounds and crossing the senses is common with the use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, though drug use induces synesthesia through artificial means and it cannot be controlled. With drugs, the user is not in control, the drug is, and in self- empowerment and magickal practice, it is extremely important for the practitioner to always be in control through his/her own natural ability. Dependence on powerful mind altering substances creates weakness of character and also creates holes in the aura and a weakening of the astral body. I am not talking recreational marijuana use here, I am referring to dependence on powerful chemicals in order to reach an altered state as some mages have been known to do. Synesthetic people are often very psychic and highly intelligent according to medical studies. CIA and U.S. Military psychics reported going through stages of synesthesia when performing extensive exercises to open their minds for psychic warfare. Synesthesia may happen with your first sound meditation or with practice. Close your eyes and note the colors, shapes and movements of the sounds. You should write this in your Book of Shadows/Black Book/journal if you keep one. You should put aside all thoughts and visions as you would for void meditation and try to “see” the sound(s)/music. In time, other senses can also come into play- what does it taste like? Smell like? The most common experience is to see the sounds, but don’t put any limitations on yourself. Natural synesthesia facilitates clairvoyance, clairaudience and other psychic abilities. Synesthesia can be a very beautiful experience and a rewarding session of meditation.

Void meditation is essential for anyone who practices power meditation, and is important for success in advanced magickal practice. Power meditation changes the strength of our thoughts and it is very important to be able to control thoughts and to turn them off or focus them at will. Thought power, also known as 'witch power' is needed for success in ritual and in using your mind to obtain what you want. Power meditation, strengthens our thoughts, and people who are more aware or sensitive will be able to pick up on our thoughts and feelings telepathically. Void meditation will train your mind to be silent so others will not know what you are thinking. The Japanese Ninja use this technique to avoid being detected while carrying out important missions that require one to advance or infiltrate, unnoticed. Void meditation trains your mind so you can focus during rituals and in every day life so your mind brings you what you desire. There are several techniques for void meditation. The goal is to turn off all of your thoughts and focus on the here and now. You get your mind to be completely still for a specified length of time. In the beginning, this can be extremely difficult, as thoughts will come into your head continually. Before you know it, you will again be thinking about something. Don't get upset with yourself as this is very normal and even for advanced practitioners, certain meditation sessions may not go as smooth as usual. Just keep bringing your mind back to focus. Patience and persistence are the keys here. It definitely helps to do some breathing exercises beforehand to induce a trance state. Some people find meditating after a heavy meal causes the mind to be easily distracted. Always try to meditate when you are fully awake and alert. If you try to do void meditation when you are tired, chances are you will quickly fall asleep. MCMLX MCMLXV MCMLXX MCMLXXV MCMLXXX MCMLXXXV MCMXC MCMXCV"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"1. Breathing exercises are optional. This is a simple method of breathing that will induce a trance state: • Breathe in for a count of six,* • Hold your breath for a count of six • Exhale for a count of six Repeat this several times until you feel relaxed. * Only hold as long as you feel comfortable. If holding for a count of six is not comfortable, then hold for a count of 4, or even 2. Just make sure you are uniform in your counts. Never hold longer than is comfortable. Breathing exercises are never to be pushed, as in doing so, they can cause damage to the nervous system. 2. Now, get your entire mind to be completely still and free of any thoughts for a specified amount of time with no thoughts or music in your head. Your mind should be a total blank. You should focus on being in the here and now. For beginners, five minutes is fine. Intermediate and advanced practitioners can go anywhere from 15 minutes to however long they feel is essential. Void meditation can be done with your eyes open or closed. When your eyes are open, you will more than likely see a mist around objects as you settle into a trance state. This is normal. If you choose to close your eyes, you may fall asleep, but this is an individual choice and use whatever method works best. For meditation with your eyes open: Choose something small to focus on. This can be a point on the wall, a second hand on a clock, or even a piece of lint on your clothing. Many choose to meditate on a candle flame. The important thing is to concentrate on your object of choice For meditation with your eyes closed: Focus inside of yourself and relax. You can put yourself deeper and deeper into a trance with a feeling of falling. This is normal. For people who are new, this falling sensation that often accompanies a deep trance can make you feel dizzy. To stop the sensation, focus on the front of your body. Everyday void meditation: Void meditation can be done anywhere and at any time with just focusing on the here and now and concentrating totally on whatever you are doing. This method works best for those of you who are unable to secure any privacy. Just set a goal to focus on the here and now for a specific amount of time each day and you will benefit.

At first, it will fade in and out, but as you progress, it will remain longer and longer. This is definitely a needed ability for magickal practice and focusing your mind power. • Focus on a specific chant or sound. You can do this either aloud or in your head. This is what is known as a \"mantra.\" You breathe in and on the exhale, chant a specific mantra or tone of your choice. One common chant used in kundalini yoga is \"Sa Ta Na Ma.\" This is pronounced \"Sah- Tah- Nah- Mah.\" You can also chant \"Sa Tan\" \"Say-Tahn\" or \"Say- Tahn- Nah- S-S-S-S.\" • Focus on a specific emotion- anger, happiness, sadness, love, hate. You can choose an emotion going by how you feel on a specific day. This is excellent training for advanced ritual. • Focus on a specific texture, for example, running your fingers back and forth across velvet or a terry towel. • Focus on a specific odor or taste. Advanced void meditation that includes adding physical positions trains both your mind and develops an iron will, and extreme inner strength. 1. Keep your entire body still. Do NOT move. This is what the advanced yogis do. Get into a comfortable position. Don't scratch any itches, just ignore them and stay focused. Muscle cramps may come and go. Ignore any physical fatigue or mental fatigue. Just continue to remain focused. 2. Add uncomfortable and/or awkward positions. Make sure these are taken from a Yoga or Tai Chi book, so that they are physically beneficial. This is a discipline that is taught in many Martial Arts schools where one learns to ignore pain, while retaining intense focus. This strengthens the mind for physical combat and drastically increases your sense of self- confidence. This will also increase your resistance to pain. Many martial arts masters meditate under cold waterfalls, in snow or other painful conditions. One's physical health must be built up here, for obvious reasons. A cold shower can be substituted. As with anything new, be sure to start out gradual. These techniques, when mastered, will give one total control over one's mind and emotions. If one faces death, one will not freeze up or panic with fear and the odds of one's survival will greatly increase. 3.

This comes with meditating, sensitizing yourself to it and working with it. With consistent practice, power meditation will naturally increase your bioelectricity. You will be able to feel this energy often, just by being aware of it. Awareness is the key to advancement in ability and power. 1. Lie quietly and become aware of the energies on the left side of your body, then your right side. 2. Direct the energy from side to side and then bring it from both sides to meet in the middle of your torso. 3. From here, expand the energy past your body and into your aura and then contract the energy. You can play with it. This is an excellent exercise for directing energy at will. 4. Continue to expand and contract the energy until both sides of your body feel balanced. Then feel the energies on the left and right sides together. 5. Feel energy from the front of your body, then the back, repeating the same steps as described above. 6. Do this again, this time from the waist up, then from the waist down. Same as above. 7. Now, feel the energy in your entire body as a whole. Practice expanding and contracting your aura several times. 8. The last time, bring the energy together in the center of your body and gently expand it out, expanding your aura, making sure it feels balanced and even. 9. Meditate on feeling the energy gently radiating and expanding your aura for a few minutes. It is very important to always direct your energy upwards and out of your crown chakra.

Light a candle and stare at the flame for 2 minutes. Make sure your attention does not wander. 2. Close your eyes and place your hands in relaxed cupped position, palms over your eyes and concentrate on the imprint of the flame in the darkness. The image will tend to move across your area of vision. Keep looking for it and bring it back and keep concentrating on it for four mintues. 3. Relax and empty your thoughts and tune into your breathing for a few minutes, concentrating only on each breath What this exercise does: This exercise prepares the mind for one-pointed concentration, which is so important to any psychic/astral workings. With the average person, thoughts are scattered and dissipate into nothing. With the trained mind that can concentrate intensely, the thoughts are single-pointed and focused like a laser and have power. 100% concentration makes the difference in astral workings. One's will is also developed with this exercise as a powerful will does not give into distraction. Do not become frustrated or impatient with yourself. It is normal for thoughts to creep in to distract you in the beginning. Total concentration takes time and is one of the most difficult aspects of training the mind. Method Two (intermediate): 1. Focus on the flame for several minutes 2. Close your eyes and place your hands in relaxed cupped position, palms over your eyes and concentrate on the imprint of the flame in the darkness. The image will tend to move across your area of vision. 3. Keeping your eyes closed, try to enter the imprint. You will find the imprint begins to compact and change color. The bright image will change to pink, then to red and grow dark. 4. Repeat the exercise if you wish. What this exercise does: This exercise trains the mind and third eye to direct psychic energy.

Let me explain: With invoking the elements, here are some examples of what can happen: Invoking fire will make you hot. Depending on how many breaths you do (only seven and under are recommended for those who have not had experience with this element). Even with adepts, 20 breaths can be extreme. While you are doing the fire meditation for the first time, more than likely while you are doing it, you will feel little or nothing. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING ANY MORE BREATHS BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FEEL NOTHING! You will feel the effects hours later. The effects of invoking fire include a fever, feeling BURNING HOT after a warm glow/aura manifests, insomnia and since water is the opposite of fire, you can get a backlash of water and this can manifest in depression. These effects can last several hours to several days. Each one of us has imbalances of certain elements and invoking the elements can cause even more imbalance so it is also important to know your strengths and weaknesses in certain elements. Invoking air can overstimulate the nervous system. Air can make you very irritable and oversensitive for a few hours to several days, depending on how much you take in. I have always been a person of extremes and I am daring, so I have never put any limitations on myself with meditations, though I have always used common sense. Now, with invoking these elements over a period of time, we become resistant to extremes of temperature, we can warm or cool our bodies at will and we can be adept at pyrokinesis, cryokinesis and other astral disciplines. If you are planning to do the elemental meditations, I strongly encourage you to keep written entries in a black book or journal regarding how these exercises affect you. Mastering the elements is one of the highest forms of magick, while others play around with props. The elements are based upon the four corners and directions. They are the foundation of the universe when working magick. Invoking and directing the elements is used to empower sigils and talismans. Each ritual or working normally has an elemental theme. By making use of the elements the power of any working is drastically amplified. Elemental magick is extremely advanced and powerful magick. There are two ways of invoking the elements. One way is total invocation as I have done (no breathing them back out and the most dangerous) and the other way is easier is to breathe the element back out into the ether. You can work up from this. Each one of us has strengths and weaknesses with certain elements. Nearly all of us have imbalances of the elements in our souls. The following meditations will correct these.

Satan gives us an inner strength and we become very strong in spirit. Unlike right hand path religions, where adherents are forever praying and searching for their god, Satan comes to us on his own. Many times, we can feel him. He comes to guide us when we get down, worried, or are experiencing problems. He snaps us into line and directs us as to what we need to do to be focused and happy. The foundation of Spiritual Satanism is in our finishing Satan's work upon humanity. This is the goal of the godhead, and is accomplished through power meditation. Humanity is currently at a very low level spiritually. When we begin to meditate, we experience profound positive changes within our lives. Satan and his Demons (The Original Gods) protect us and look out for us as we transform and achieve personal power. With Satan, we have protection that outsiders do not have. We can advance in the powers of the mind and soul as far as we wish. For outsiders, this can prove dangerous. Satan also gives us knowledge. \"I lead to the straight path without a book.\" As we transform and grow, our lives change for the better and we are much happier. We learn through Satan how to take control of our own lives and destiny instead of being at the mercy of fate. We learn to heal ourselves, and to fulfill our own desires, using the powers of our mind and soul. In making a commitment, we engage a formal ritual. This is done out of free will. We are making a choice, as opposed to being dragged off to some Christian church, and reciting canned prayers (stolen and corrupted from Eastern mantras) in front of a bunch of idiots. With knowledge and research, we can prove beyond all doubt that the nazarene, \"jehova\" and ilk are all fictitious characters, stolen from and corrupted concepts to remove all spiritual knowledge so that a \"chosen\" few can rule the world using powers of the mind and soul. For further information, please visit www.exposingchristianity.com Because so many have been forcefully indoctrinated with these characters, and what they stand for (Enemies of Satan), we renounce them permanently in the dedication ritual. This proves to be psychologically healthy and liberating. The initiation ritual is very personal, unless you decide to have friends participate, or are doing it as part of a group.

I received a very small number of letters from people who were confused and harassed by Christians. One person performed a reverse ritual and Satan left him. Totally. Satan does not push himself on anyone. Christians are deceived. They believe their \"God\" to be \"loving\" and \"forgiving.\" In truth, this monster is a spiteful, hateful attacker of human beings. When one is with Satan, one is always under his protection. He looks out for us and we enter a new life where we no longer have the worries that others endure. Things are not perfect, but they are always much better. Satan does not punish people who reject him, he simply leaves and one is left all alone to endure the torments of the enemy. These people wrote to me because after several months, they were begging for Satan to take them back. The enemy did absolutely nothing for them. All were extremely regretful they ever left and very desperate to come back. Question: I am under-age and my parents would cause me serious problems if they ever caught me doing a Satanic ritual. Answer: If there is absolutely no way you can perform the ritual without placing yourself in danger, you can perform it in your astral temple. You can do the above ritual when you are older. Performing the dedication on the astral is every bit as valid as doing it physically. Satan is very understanding concerning teens who are forced into accepting Christianity while living at home and being underage. Question: I am underage, living in a Christian home and my parents force me to go to church and participate in Christian sacraments. Can I still do the dedication? Will Satan be angry with me? Answer: Yes, you can still perform the ritual. Satan understands. As long as you are loyal to him in your heart, he will not be angry with you. Those of you under 18 are not free. There is no need to reveal your allegiance to Satan to anyone. What is in your heart is more important than anything else. Satan advises us in the Al-Jilwah not to reveal our religion to outsiders if it will cause us harm in any way, this is especially important for teens. Just renounce the Christian \"God\" in your mind if you are forced to participate in any of his garbage. Satan understands it can be downright dangerous, and in some cases even life-threatening for teens living in Christian homes to reveal their allegiance to him.

There is nothing but misinformation from most of the readily available and most popular writings. Following the instructions written in most grimoires is not only wrong, but can be very dangerous. My own experience with various Demons is that they are very proud and being respectful is very important. Recently, several High Priests and High Priestesses performed energy work with many different Demons including all of the Demons of the Goetia. All 72 of the Goetic Demons have been freed and many more. We found the true identities of most of these Demons. Many have used different aliases in order to avoid being viciously abused. These Demons, unlike the descriptions given in many of the old grimoires are not monsters. They are beautiful, popular, and important Gods. ASMODEUS TOLD SOLOMON: \"SO ASK ME NOT MANY THINGS; FOR THY KINGDOM ALSO AFTER A LITTLE TIME IS TO BE DISRUPTED AND THY GLORY IS BUT FOR A SEASON, AND SHORT WILL BE THY TYRANNY OVER US.\" Demons are immortal; a “season” is but a few thousand years to them. The Christian \"God\" is losing power. Father Satan has informed me that our side has won. We warn everyone: using the spiritually abusive methods of the old grimoires is not only foolish, but will inevitably result in personal disaster. The Demons must always be approached with extreme honesty and respect.

Don't say you weren't warned.... When we are new, most of the Demons are willing to help us. The goal of Satanism is to become as a god. This means self-empowerment. As we progress through our own efforts, we become more and more adept. We should be able to rely upon our own powers instead of the powers of others outside of us. The Demons are best when it comes to imparting knowledge and wisdom, so that we may learn and advance our own powers. As we progress, we should be able to be competent in all aspects of magick and be able to influence others and our environments on our own, without any outside help. Although, even with an adept, there may be circumstances where issues can be overwhelming and the help of a Demon is needed. For spiritual guidance, the Demons are here for us at all levels, from those who are new, to those who are advanced. From my own experiences, I would highly recommend to those of you who are serious in progressing spiritually, to establish a close and strong relationship with a Demon who is willing to work with you and guide you along the left hand path. This can be a very rewarding experience to say the least. How to summon: Always treat the Demons with honesty and respect. Never command, demand or try to exploit them in any way. THE CORRECT METHODS FOR SUMMONING A DEMON: 1. Know the Demon you intend to summon. This website lists the attributes and available knowledge about different Demons. All of the Goetic Demons are human friendly, as we know from experience. 2. It is important to have a specific purpose; know exactly *why* you are summoning a particular Demon. 3. When we ask assistance from a Demon, it is only proper to offer something in return. Be prepared to give something in return. This is something both you and the Demon should agree upon. Remember, the Elder Gods value one’s word, honesty, integrity and one’s honor as the utmost importance. NEVER agree to anything you know you cannot follow through on. 4. Know the method you plan to use to communicate with the Demon. One of the most important steps in the summoning of a Demon you are not yet familiar with, is to go through Satan. MMDCXC MMDCXCV MMDCC MMDCCV MMDCCX MMDCCXV MMDCCXX MMDCCXXV"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The reasons for this are serious. Not all Demons are friendly to humans, nor are all Demons of Satan. Satan has authority over all of the Goetic Demons. Most Demons are friendly when treated with respect and summonings result in a positive experience. I have found many Demons that have caused outsiders problems are often friendly to a confirmed Satanist. I have learned much through my own interactions with Demons and through the many experiences of others, both the laity and the Ministry. Experience is, as always, the best teacher. There are different levels of experience when one establishes contact with a Demon: 1. The Demon speaks to us through our thoughts (telepathy). With telepathy, the words of the Demon come to us through our thoughts. In the beginning, it can be difficult for those who are not as sensitive or lack psychic ability to differentiate between the communication from another entity and their own thoughts. With power meditation and experience, this becomes much easier over time. 2. We see and hear the Demon. This is with people who are more psychic and open. 3. We invoke the energy of the Demon. This is powerful and electrifying. We are engulfed in a strong aura. During this time, we will often hear the Demon speak to us and we may in addition, see the Demon. 4. During an actual summoning, the Demon appears and speaks to us through scrying into a mirror, in the smoke of the incense, or in some other manner. This is best for those who are new. With scrying, if we are sensitive enough, we can often feel the Demon touch us if he/she chooses to do so. 5. Tangible contact; objects in our rooms are moved, there is actual physical evidence of the Demon having been present. There are accounts in popular books concerning extremely powerful energies encountered when evoking a Demon. To my knowledge, no one using the methods outlined on this website has ever experienced anything negative or overwhelming. I have invoked Demons many times (see Invocation & Evocation ) and the energy was never beyond anything I couldn’t handle or in any way uncomfortable. Methods: Copy, print out or draw the sigil of the Demon you wish to summon on clean paper. It is important that you be left alone and not disturbed in any way. Close your eyes and visualize the sigil in your mind as best you can. It is ok to open them and look at the sigil again ( as many times as MMDCCXXX MMDCCXXXV MMDCCXL MMDCCXLV MMDCCL MMDCCLV MMDCCLX MMDCCLXV MMDCCLXX"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"needed) to get a clearer image. While visualizing, recite, or chant the name of the Demon repeatedly either in your mind or aloud. Recite the following prayer: Lord Satan, by your grace, grant me, I pray thee the power to conceive in my mind and to execute that which I desire to do, the end which I would attain by thy help, O Mighty Satan, the one True God who livest and reignest forever and ever. I entreat thee to inspire__________(name of Demon) to manifest before me that he/she may give me true and faithful answer, so that I may accomplish my desired end, provided that it is proper to his/her office. This I respectfully and humbly ask in Your Name, Lord Satan, may you deem me worthy, Father. The Demon can manifest in different ways. • Through a mirror as in \"scrying.\" You will see the Demon in the mirror. • Through the smoke of the incense • The Demon appears directly, when one is sensitive enough and in a deep meditative state. Prepare your area. Your first summoning rituals should be performed at night. The reasons for this are the energies are different at night from those during the day and it is easier to be alone and free from distractions. When one has established relationships with certain Demons, it is no longer necessary to perform a formal summoning ritual. The Demon can appear to us night or day and all we need do is concentrate to contact them through telepathy. You will need: • A quiet place where you will not be disturbed. • Quality incense with a pleasing fragrance. I strongly recommend when working with any new incense to try it out before the actual ritual or summoning as cheap stinking incense is insulting to the spirits and can be embarrassing in any ritual. See INCENSE • One or more black or blue candles. Black is choice, but blue is ok for a substitute if you cannot obtain black. Also, if available, the candle color of the specific Demon you wish to summon. (These are listed on this website). • Your paper containing the Demon’s sigil. When finished with the sigil, find a safe place to store it, preferably in your own black book or journal. ALWAYS treat this paper/sigil with extreme respect and NEVER burn it! The sigil can be reused. There is no need for a nine-foot circle. Demons *hate* circles and there is no need for a “license to depart” as both are offensive and insulting. Treat the Demons with respect and in turn, you will receive the same.

This is a good sign and a go-ahead. If for some reason the Demon doesn’t answer, try another time. Many times the Demon does appear, but those who are new to summoning are not psychically open enough or experienced to sense him/her. Most people have had to perform the summoning ritual more than once for the Demon to manifest. Often, the Demon does answer, but many are not aware. Look for coincidences and things out of the ordinary. Awareness here is everything. Always offer a token of appreciation and gratitude in return for his/her services. Some ideas are publicity for the Demon, working against Christianity, working to advance Satanism or any service that you both can agree upon.

When working with energy, the energy is always on the outside of the operator and never inside his/her body. With evocation, there is never a direct tie or connection. Invocation is taking the spirit into one’s self. The being actually enters the operator’s body. An example is invoking a Demon and the Demon speaks through the operator using his/her voice to communicate. Often when this happens, one’s voice may change, becoming deeper, raspy, or different in some way. During séances, often the medium is able to produce a substance called \"ectoplasm\" to provide a luminescent material in order for the evoked spirit to manifest itself visibly. This is a form of invocation as there is a direct connection with the spirit and the medium. There are many different beings. One thing I have learned is with Satan’s Demons, when they enter us; they never harm us in any way. We are MMDCCCXV MMDCCCXX MMDCCCXXV MMDCCCXXX MMDCCCXXXV MMDCCCXL MMDCCCXLV MMDCCCL"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"always conscious and fully aware. When they are speaking through us, we are aware of what they are saying and rarely is anything ever forced. One doesn’t experience gaps or \"missing time\" as those who invoke angelic beings have. Angels often masquerade as Demons. There are entities that are NOT of Satan and when they are invited in (usually these are angels or related ilk) they will take over and cause harm to the person who invoked them and the individual will not have any memory of the event. They will have missing time and more than likely other lingering problems as well. Satan is the bringer of knowledge. He has no reason to cause anyone to forget something or have lapses in memory in order to hide something. People who dabble with angels and other astral entities of whom they are not familiar with can experience these problems, and then of course, through ignorance and foolishness they blame \"The Devil.\" Some Demons come around and like to play. One time when was at work, a coworker showed me a photo of his girlfriend. I felt a Demon enter me and he said to me \"go ahead.\" I began reading her. The co-worker was surprised at my accuracy. Of course, this was my Demon friend speaking through me. Most available texts on spells and magick, due to a lack of knowledge (spiritual and magickal knowledge was removed and obliterated by the Christian church), not only give wrongful instructions, but instructions that can also be very dangerous when working black magick, using death energy and other destructive forces. There is a great difference between evocation and invocation. When we invoke energy or spirits, we create a link to the energy or spirit through ourselves. Obviously, if one is using destructive or death energy, this can be very dangerous. Invocation also includes building up energy within one’s soul and discharging it through one’s aura and/or chakras. This creates a tie to the victim. Most black magick spells that go wrong do so because of errors on the part of the mage. There are other reasons for a black magick working going wrong such as the victim having a powerful aura that is able to deflect negative energy; the victim is under powerful spiritual protection (If one is under Satan’s protection, nothing can touch him/her) or bad timing on the part of the mage. There can be other reasons, but the above are the most common. Even white magick where healing is concerned can pose problems to the mage who invokes the energy before applying it. Any time energy is invoked, a powerful connection is established. Obviously, no one in his/her right mind would want to connect with a disease. If the mage is working on money, personal power or some other positive application of energy, then invoking is desirable. This also goes for love spells and workings of lust.

For Example- Evoking Death Energy: The advanced mage should be familiar with this energy. Death energy is prevalent in mortuaries, cemeteries, places where wars were fought, where massacres occurred and other places of death. The energy is grey, dismal, and depressing. The mage should go into a trance, surround him/herself with the energy, but *NOT* take it into his/her body. The mage should direct the energy using his/her will and visualization into a ball or other form. The energy should be condensed tighter and tighter into the ball or form for power. The formed energy can then be expanded or contracted according to how the mage intends for it to be delivered to the victim. If delivering to the victim’s chakras, the energy should be tightly compacted, and exploded, or expanded upon entry into the victim's body. If the energy is to collect and adhere to the victim’s aura, the energy should be expanded to envelope the entire aura. Variations can be used according to one’s individual preferences. © Copyright 2005, 2006, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 Ouija Boards Ouija Boards are excellent for contacting and having conversations with Demons and spirits. I prefer to work the board alone, as another person is a distraction and prevents any real intimacy with the spirit contact. For those of you who are new to this, make sure the board is on a completely level surface. It is important to enter into a trance when using a ouija board. Place your fingertips lightly on each side of the planchette. Soon it will gently begin to pull. Just relax and let it work. It can take a few minutes to get going. It is important to be free from distractions and not to be disturbed. My experience is I sort of go into a trance. Like when scrying or invoking spirits of the deceased, everything else in the room is blocked out. My total focus is on the board. It is sort of like an aura around all of the edges of the board and my attention is completely locked in and nothing else outside of me, exists. This is just my own experience, we are all individuals, so some of yours may be different. I am finding more and more, the higher ranking the Demon, the more energy you will feel.

I don't remember how long I was using the board. This was for quite a while. He asked me to say something specific out loud. When I did, I really felt powerful energy light up lke a flame inside of me. When we have very close contact or invoke Demons, we can feel their energy. My skin still feels sensitized, like when I have a fever or sunburn, only no pain, even this morning. Their energy is electrifying. Father's energy is different, as I'm sure many of you have experiencd during and after rituals. Calming and beautiful. Demons come to us through telepathy and astral projection. It is my experience that Demons project differently than humans. With humans, you can see the connecting strands and when they leave, they snap back out quickly. Books say they are silver colored. The ones I saw were copper. I have never seen strands with Demons, but I know the higher ranking ones physically exist in another world. There are some Demons who can stay with us at all times, to protect us. These Demons are lesser as they are in spirit form. The more you use a Ouija Board, the better you will become in working it. When we establish a close relationship with a Demon, all we have to do is tune into them and they will usually come to us. Each of us is individual and will have slightly different experiences in using a ouija board and receiving messages: 1. The automatic method - In this case, the planchette moves automatically, without the operator knowing what the spirit concerned is going to say. Messages in foreign languages will also be received, even in languages the operator does not know and has never heard before. 2. The inspirational method - this is the most common: here the messages will be given in a sort of thinking aloud inside or outside one's mind. In this case, one practically knows beforehand what the spirit is about to write. By frequent repetition this inspiration will become a loud thinking and listening in the passive communication. One will perceive messages from the one's mind or from outside of the self. This is sort of like dictation- the words come into your head and then your hands move the planchette. 3. The intuitive method - where you have the feeling as if you moved the planchette yourself. Any questions will be answered instantly. This is a kind of clair-knowledge. The planchette spells out words and sentences in full consciousness, without the operator hearing anything or being inspired in any way. The methods also can appear in a mixed kind, for example half automatic and half inspirational or intuitive and inspirational or all together. Which of the methods will be the dominant one will only be known after a long period of exercising.

I do not believe in telling others how to think or what they should or how they should believe, this is up to the individual, but one important thing everyone should be aware of is- Satanism is very different from other religions. Satanism is different in that it does not mix. Mixing Satanism and Christianity for example is like mixing water with electricity. I have seen and read accounts where certain people who had an interest in Satanism, still had sympathies with Christianity. There were still strong unconscious ties to the Christian religion, most resulting from intense indoctrination. Most of us come from Christian backgrounds and for many there are lingering issues and hang-ups. Christian programming is very intense and given the extremely large amounts of psychic energy that have gone into it through centuries of Christian prayers and belief, there is a lot of power one must overcome to be totally free. People who are uncertain of their beliefs and who still have strong ties to Christianity or other related religions, either consciously, or in many cases subconsciously, are setting themselves up for some very frightening and negative psychic experiences. Calling upon Demons and going deep into the occult can bring up some very unexpected negative encounters for dabblers. This is the work of enemy alien entities that use fear to keep humans away Satan. In most cases this works, as it instills terror in the dabbler and he/she usually goes running back to the nazarene and blames Satan. I strongly suggest those who wish to go this far, first become strong in Satan. Very, very few, if any, progress in power unless they have a powerful protector. When one who is serious in developing the powers of the mind advances to any formidable level, or has any serious ability, he/she will be approached by powerful entities asking him/her to take sides in the spiritual war.

There are some things, though that are advanced and one should wait before getting involved in these practices. At some point, it is a very important step in Satanism to cut all ties with any and all other religions. To avoid doing this is inviting disaster. This must be done from the soul in that there should be no indecision or mixed feelings. If there are mixed feelings, then one should wait, as this is a permanent step. For those of you who have already performed dedication rituals, you are fine.

A pendulum is usually accurate, easy to use and takes little time. Begin by taking something like a small crystal, pendent, ring or other small lightly weighted object and attaching it to a necklace chain, string, ribbon, or some other kind of strand. This should be only kept for divination purposes and not for other uses. Hold the strand with your fingertips and let the weighted part hang. For those who are new and or inexperienced with using a pendulum, it is a good idea to place yourself into a trance when working with a pendulum. Once you are confident in obtaining correct answers, you no longer need to be in the trance state. Now ask a question you know the answer to, like what day it is. Start out by asking yes or no questions. See what the pendulum does and get a feel for it. I have found swinging right/left, like shaking ones head to imply no, means no and forward/backward like a nodding of the head means yes. When it goes in circles, the answer is uncertain. The wider the swing of MMMXX MMMXXV MMMXXX MMMXXXV MMMXL MMMXLV MMML MMMLV"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"the pendulum, the more accurate the answer. Pendulums can also be asked questions regarding how much, how many. The pendulum will swing, stop, swing again, and continue to do so a number of times before it completely stops. For finding lost items, take the pendulum around the area and ask it if you are near the lost item. Spirits can also communicate to us through pendulums. We can concentrate and focus on the name of the spirit or Demon we wish to contact. The pendulum is an excellent way to communicate with Demons. With Demons, the pendulum can be placed over a drawing of or copy of the sigil and asked questions. THE VARIOUS USES FOR A PENDULUM: Pendulums are an excellent means for communicating with the spirit world, checking the accuracy of other readings and divinations and many other different things. TO FIND SOMETHING LOST: In a Room - hold the pendulum and ask where the object is located. The pendulum will swing in the direction of the lost object. In a House - Ask the pendulum, room by room, i.e., is it in the kitchen? yes/no, bathroom and so on until you narrow it down. Then go into the room and section it off. On a Map - Start by asking if the missing person or object is in the area of the map. (For missing persons, it is helpful to have a photo and an item he or she has touched or worn). Hold the pendulum in the hand you normally use to divine with it and a pointer or pencil in the other. Point to places on the map, until you arrow it down and go from there. Outside: Ask - \"Am I facing the right direction to find... If the pendulum swings foreword or backward, you are moving in the right direction. In circles, move with the circle slowly, until it swings foreword and backward. You can also draw a floor plan of a house or building and ue the map method. OUTDOOR RITUAL SITES: Try using a map at first to pinpoint a good area. Places where Ley Lines and other energies on the Earth grid intersect, are powerful spots to perform all kinds of rituals. The pendulum will circle so fast when positioned over these areas, it will nearly be parallel to the Earth. The stronger the energies, the faster the pendulum will spin. PAST LIVES: You can write dates on separate small pieces of paper or cards and space them out, evenly on a table. Ask about your past life and the pendulum will swing in the direction of the paper with the accurate date. You can keep going back this way in time. You can do the same with continents, MMMLX MMMLXV MMMLXX MMMLXXV MMMLXXX MMMLXXXV MMMXC MMMXCV MMMC"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"narrow it down to countries in which you lived. People you now know and their relationship to you in a past life. Put on separate pieces of paper- lover, friend, spouse, family member and so on. Name the person and ask the question. HEALTH: Ask about each area of your body or ask the aura of someone you want to know about. Keep narrowing down the questions with each answer you receive from the pendulum. GAMBLING: Be careful here, as mistakes can be costly, but you can take the pendulum to a casino and ask if this is a table or slot machine, you can win big at quickly and easily. The same can be done when betting on horses and so on. *It pays to be real experienced before you start going for the money. RELATIONSHIPS: A pendulum can tell you all sorts of things about other people. A photo or personal item of the person in question is a big help, but is not necessary. Just hold the pendulum over the item and ask questions. PLACES TO GO TO SHOP OR GET REPAIRS DONE: Just open the phone book and ask where is the most inexpensive and the best quality place for what you want. Name places and the pendulum will answer yes/no. A pendulum can also be helpful in diagnosing car trouble before pulling everything apart or taking it to a shop. RITUALS: Ask what kind of incense to burn, the best time to perform the ritual, the best place, candle colors and so on. DEMONS: For simple contact of a Demon, place the pendulum over the Sigil of the particular Demon and begin asking questions. TAROT CARDS: Lay out several Tarot Cards as possible answers to a question. Ask the question and the pendulum will begin swinging in the direction of the card with the answer, until a yes is reached when it is placed directly above the card. Any yes or no questions can be accurately answered with a pendulum. Small cards or papers with names of people, places or things can be lined up from left to right and the pendulum will start swinging in the direction of the card or piece of paper with the answer. The pendulum should swing widely, as this is a definite yes or no. Circles are uncertain and a small swing is not so sure. © Copyright 2005, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 MMMCV MMMCX MMMCXV MMMCXX MMMCXXV MMMCXXX MMMCXXXV MMMCXL"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"  Incubus and Succubus Incubi and Succubi: Sexual Relations With Demons Spirit sex is real. It requires some psychic work in order to open your mind to senses not normally accessible to the average person, but the way to do this is much easier than with other methods and a lot more pleasureable. Demon friends and lovers are wonderful for those who are in prison or incarcerated in any way. Many of us have experienced actually being physically touched by a Demon. The feeling is just like that of being touched by a human hand. This can go much further into actual sexual intercourse and lovemaking. Sexual intercourse with a Demon is blissful ecstacy. Because Demons come to us in etherial/astral form, they are able to penetrate our bodies and stimulate areas not easily accessible by other humans. Male Demons have no trouble finding and stimulating the G-spot in their women partners. Female Demons can get right to the prostrate gland in their men, resulting in a full deep orgasm. HOW TO BEGIN: First off, it is important to perform a ritual to Father Satan, stating your needs, whether they be just sexual, a love/sexual relationship, an open relationship, where you are free to have other sexual partners without any jealousy on either side; be specific. Some Demons are monogamus, in that they only have one partner and this goes both ways. These Demons take monogamy VERY seriously and if a relationship is violated by a human being, the partner of the human being could in the worst of cases wind up dead. Demons are known like humans to become very jealous. If a human is in an empty marriage and is just having sex with their spouse out of a sense of duty, Demons can be very understanding regarding this and will often overlook it, provided, in monogamus sexual love relations, your Demon is always #1. Keep in mind, once a commitment is made it will last a lifetime and beyond, so don't take this lightly. Your Demon will remain monogamus, also. You should find a Demon who is compatable with you. Remember, if you want a free, open relationship where you are free to have other sex partners, you must specify this in ritual. After your ritual, YOU MUST BE RELAXED AND OPEN, more than likely, your Demon will come to you when you are lying down and relaxed in bed. This will feel like electrifying energy and like kundalini, it feels exhilerating. Now, for people that are new to this, to begin this and open up, just begin fantasizing about having intercourse with your Demon.

Ask your Demon to show themselves to you. Relax, close your eyes and tune in. You should see an image of your Demon in your mind. Even if you can't, you can picture an ideal lover for an image your Demon can inhabit to start with. When you begin to fantasize and do this a number of times, your Demon will feel this on the astral and enjoy it as well. You can masturbate yourself to orgasm in the beginning, until a full physical manifestation takes over. When you do this, your Demon will have an orgasm, as well. This will take time so be patient and persistent. The fantasies, done night after night will begin to get much more vivid and before you know it, you will feel your Demon and even see your Demon as you would another human being. Your Demon will work with you to open your psychic channels, as opposed to just plain fantasizing on your own. Your Demon will more than likely come to you each night when you lie down to go to bed. Demons enjoy sex very much and they can wear out a human being. One man actually had to push a female Demoness off of himself in the morning in order to get up for work after having all night sex. She didn't want to stop. Pleasure is way beyond anything with a human being and spiritual sex can become addictive. Chances are, no longer will human sexual relationships be desired or satisfying. In addition, one does not have to worry about contracting sexually transmitted diseases or experiencing unwanted pregnancies. A Demon lover will also be protective of you. They are wonderful with listening to any worries, concerns or problems and are often helpful in punishing enemies and taking care of things for you. When the proper psychic channels are open, two-way conversations can take place. This is an enormous help in spiritual empowerment and advancement. They will tell you things, teach you and in some cases, even contact other Demons for you. Intense contact with Demons involves an energy exchange. The Demons, being on a higher spiritual level than humans have much more energy and extreme closeness can produce effects in us humans that feel like sunburned skin and/or oversensitivity, until we get used to this or advance our own energy levels, which is the goal of Spiritual Satanism. © Copyright 2002, 2006, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 GUARDIAN DEMONS High Priest Salem Burke uses a homemade Ouija Board to communicate MMMCLXXXV MMMCXC MMMCXCV MMMCC MMMCCV MMMCCX MMMCCXV MMMCCXX"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"with Demons \"I WAS DEMONSTRATING FROM THE FLOOR, USUALLY I DO NOT PLACE ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON THE GROUND UNLESS THERE IS A CLOTH BENEATH IT SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PURPOSE (AND THE TV IS NOT ON).

She asked if there was a Guardian Demon for her. The planchette spelled out G-U-S- I-O-N. Later on, Gusion appeared to her in a dream. A couple of weeks later, I drew his sigil, we took it to the tattoo shop, and she had it tattooed on her arm. She has made some major improvements and things have been going well for her. My Demon is not a Goetic demon and I had some trouble finding his Sigil, but I found it and did the same. I also had his name tattooed on my arm under his sigil. We don't have to have tattoos to get in touch with our Guardian Demons. There are several methods for contact. One method is to use a Ouija Board. We don't have to have another person working a Ouija Board with us. I work my board alone most of the time. When there are two or even more people working a Ouija Board, this can create distractions and this can cause the board to give inaccurate answers. in addition, there are many times when one wishes to ask personal or private questions. This is best when done alone where one can relax into a trance, which is so necessary for operating a Ouija Board. When I was new, my Demon first communicated through letters. U R (you are) C U (see you) for goodbye. This way, I definitely knew this was for real, as I expected words. Another interesting thing, I have the planet that he rules over, ruling my house of partnership. He also rules an astrological point and that planet is exactly on the point in the sign that he rules. This is not the norm, though as I found later that he and I were extremely close in a past life thousands of years ago. Another method of finding out who your Guardian Demon is, is to use a pendulum. You will need a decent pendulum and a wide mouthed glass jar. Start out by asking how many letters are in his or her name. The pendulum will start to circle, then stop, then circle again, then stop and again make circles until it completely stops. Count the number of times it makes circles and here you will have the number of letters in your Demon's name.

Begin with the first letter and ask the pendulum if it is A, B, C and so on. When the pendulum hits the side of the glass jar, write down the letter and continue on to the next letter in his or her name, again going through the alphabet. Make sure you are completely relaxed and preferably in a trance for an accurate reading. Using a Ouija Board is also an excellent way of establishing contact and getting answers, especially for those who are new to Satanism. Those of us who are experienced normally communicate with our Demons telepathically. My Demon definitely wanted to make contact with me. He helped me with religion and how to better relate to Satan when I was new. He also helped me with meditation and spiritual exercises. For those of you who are doing yoga and/or chakra work, just be persistent. It took me a couple of months when I started at age thirteen. I was too young to understand what yoga was really all about, but I definitely could feel the energy. Our Guardian Demons can help us in our magick and spirituality. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich © Copyright 2002, 2005, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457  Sex Magic Sex Magick Sexual Orgasm is equivalent in power to the Life Force. Using sexual orgasm in ritual and in your magickal workings can give much added power to your outcome. Sex Magick is ancient, extremely powerful and is the creative principle. At the moment of orgasm, one automatically enters a brief trance state. The powerful orgasmic energy can be directed. This is visualized as a brilliant bright light like the sun and can be directed into thoughtforms, the one of one's desires, talismans and so forth. Women and men both differ in sexual energy. Women tend to peak in power according to cycles. Women are at the height of their power during menstruation. Psychic work, astral projection and other pursuits that require heightened sensitivity are greatly assisted after a strong orgasm. Orgasm is also an excellent way to induce relaxation before meditation. Sexual fluids, both semen and vaginal secretions, and also menstrual blood have the power of the life force.

Visualize the orgasmic energy in the form of a beam, ball or vortex, penetrating the object/person, lighting it up with a brilliant aura of energy that is programmed. This is basic simple sex magick. Sex magick can be done alone, or with a partner or Demon/ess or in a group. When working with others, it is very important as in all magickal practices that everyone work together with some sort of organized effort. Merging orgasmic energies with a Demon/ess is extremely powerful. This article was written a long time ago.

Introduction to Sex Magick © Copyright 2002, 2005, Joy of Satan Ministries;  Love Spells Love Spell To incite love or lust, sexual orgasm is used and directed into the soul of the desired one. This ideally should be done often and when he or she is asleep. Stimulate yourself to climax by fantasizing over the desired one. At the moment of climax, visualize the energy lighting up his or her entire body and aura and command it with an affirmation. The affirmation should be short, in the present tense and to the point. For example: \"__(name of desired one)__ is deeply in love with me and sexually desires me.\" To further empower the spell, go into a trance and when he or she is preferable sleeping, visualize his or her and pull out his/her light body and gently but firmly command it. For example: _(name of desired one)__, you love me and desire me greatly, every day. I am irresistible to you.\" The more often you do this, the better.

Astral projection is ideal, but not necessary. A deep meditative state and visualization are the keys. You should construct your temple during ritual, where you can ask Father Satan to bless it. Meditate for as long as you need to construct your own place. This should be done after the invocation where you write a request for Satan to bless and consecrate your temple. You can construct your temple any way you wish. This is your area. Visualize the outside of your temple first. This can be a pyramid or any shape you choose, and made of any materials you choose (they should be strong). Walk through the door. This is your area. Create your own altar, carpet or floor, any size, shape or color. You can add anything to your temple that you wish. Burning lamps of fire, huge Baphomets, velvet walls of red, blue, or black, seats with cushions lining the walls for meeting with Demons, huge golden or silver incense burners- these are just a few ideas. This is your very own private inner place where you are free. The more you visit this place, the stronger it will become. When finished with the ritual, you should at some time perform sex magick where you go to your astral temple and use orgasm to direct a powerful energy of light (this should be electric blue) to fill the entire place. This can be done more than once. When finished, you can invite your Guardian Demon and any other Demons you have relationships with to see it. Uses for your astral temple: • Ritual • Meditation (all kinds and astral work) • Telepathic communication with other human beings • Meeting with Demons You can meet with Demons here. You should first know the Demon you wish to meet with and have a relationship with him/her. Here is a place where you can communicate and ask questions. You can also go there and focus on certain issues requiring psychic ability or communicate telepathically. To communicate telepathically with another human being, go to your temple at a time when he/she is sleeping and ’will’ his/her soul to your temple. Do this by visualization. When he/she is present, if you wish to influence him/her, separate his/her soul drawing out the light body and speak to the light body, giving short commands in the present tense.

The following is an excerpt from \"A Treatise on Astral Projection\" by Robert Bruce: \"How To Enter A Trance Relax and calm your mind through breath awareness. Imagine you are climbing down a ladder in the dark. Don’t visualize a ladder; just imagine you can feel yourself doing it. On the exhale, feel yourself climbing a step or two down the ladder. On the inhale, feel yourself holding still on the ladder. What is needed is a mental falling effect inside your mind. This changes the level of brain wave activity from the awake level (Beta) to the asleep level (Alpha) or the deep sleep level (Theta). Once your level of brain wave activity reaches Alpha you will enter a trance. Keep doing this for as long as it takes. The time it takes to enter trance will vary, depending on your experience with deep relaxation and mental calmness. Note: Once you get the heavy feeling, stop the mental falling exercise. If you don’t like the ladder, imagine you are in a lift [elevator], feel yourself falling on the exhale and holding on the inhale. Or, Imagine you are a feather, feel yourself floating down on the exhale and holding still on the inhale. As I stated above, you need a mental falling effect to lower your level of brain wave activity. This mental falling effect, when combined with deep relaxation and mental calmness, will cause you to enter the trance state. Feel free to use any scenario you are familiar with to bring about this going deeper feeling. A trance feels like: Everything gets quieter and you feel like you are in a much bigger place. There is a very slight humming feeling in your body. Everything feels different. It feels a bit like putting a cardboard box over your head in the dark, you can feel the atmosphere change. It’s like everything goes fuzzy or slightly blurred. Any sharp noises, while in trance are painful. Deep Trance The level of trance you achieve depends greatly on your relaxation, concentration skills and will power. To enter a deeper trance, i.e., Theta level and beyond, you have to concentrate much more and for much MMMCCCLXXXV MMMCCCXC MMMCCCXCV MMMCD MMMCDV MMMCDX MMMCDXV MMMCDXX"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"longer, on the mental falling sensation aided by breath awareness. The first level of trance, i.e., when you get very heavy, is quite deep enough for projection. I strongly advise against forcing yourself deeper than a light trance, until you have plenty of experience with the trance state. How can you tell if you are entering a deep trance? There are four very noticeable symptoms: 1. An uncomfortable feeling of cold that doesn’t make you shiver, coupled with a steady loss of body heat. 2. Mentally, you will feel very odd and everything will feel extremely slooooow. Your thought processes will slow down as if you had been given a strong pain killing injection. 3. You will feel disassociated from your body, i.e., a strong floating sensation and everything will seem far away. 4. Total physical Paralysis. Note: These four things, ALL TOGETHER, signify you are entering a deep trance. Do not mistake the mild floating sensation you sometimes get with light trance, i.e., as you astral body comes loose. Or the slight loss of body heat from sitting still for a long time and the mild paralysis, i.e., the heaviness, for a deep trance. The sensation of deep trance is quite uncomfortable and unmistakable for what it is. It is very difficult to get into the deep trance state, as you need highly developed relaxation, concentration and trance state skills plus lots and lots of will power and mental energy. You will not accidentally fall into it. If you are worried you are going too deep, remember this: You CAN pull yourself out of it at any time. Concentrate ALL your will on moving your fingers or toes. Once you can move a finger or toe, flex your hands, move your arms, shake your head, i.e., reanimate your body; and get up and walk around for a few minutes. Falling into a deep trance should not be a problem with these exercises. Energy Body Expansion At some point after entering the trance state, you will feel a mild paralysis come over you. This will soon be accompanied by a deepening vibration and a buzzing feeling all over. You may also feel like you are huge and swollen. The paralysis, vibrations and the huge feeling are symptoms of the energy body expanding and the astral body loosening. This is part of the normal sleep process. The energy body expands and opens in order to accumulate and store energy. During this, the astral body drifts free, slightly out phase with the physical body.\" [End of Excerpt] Some people use a tape recorder and listen to the talking through and statements. The drawback here is when in a deep trance state, sounds can become painful and jar the nervous system.

What works for one person may not work for another. While in this state, you can regress into a past life, by walking through a door or \"portal\" in your mind. The deep trance state is the time to make repeated affirmations to yourself to program your mind. Self-hypnosis is much like hypnotizing others, with the exception, you make the statements to yourself. Again, several sessions may be necessary. Bring yourself out slowly and gradually, as you would do in returning from the astral. © Copyright 2005, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 Hypnotizing Others It is important to read all of the articles in the hypnosis section so you know what you are doing before hypnotizing another person. In order to effectively hypnotize another person, that person must be completely and deeply relaxed. The person should be sitting comfortably in a reclined position. When lying down, the subject is likely to fall asleep. You must stay calm and in control at all times. Begin by talking the subject through total body relaxation. Start at the feet, have the subject tense them up and relax them; then the ankles, the calves, knees and so on, working your way to the subjects face and head. When the subject is fully relaxed, tell him/her to remember a happy event that took place in their past. Ask him/her questions about it, where it took place, who was there, how he/she felt, what was in the room or area the event took place and so forth. This is done to activate the intuitive right side of the subject’s brain and the subconscious mind of memory. When you are finished with the above, tell the subject you are going to count backwards. With each number, he/she will become more and more relaxed: • “ Ten; you are becoming more and more relaxed than before.” • “ Nine; you are drifting down deeper and deeper into total relaxation” • “ Eight; your body is totally relaxed; you can barely feel your body. • “ Seven; you are completely relaxed and feel very peaceful” MMMCDLXX MMMCDLXXV MMMCDLXXX MMMCDLXXXV MMMCDXC MMMCDXCV MMMD"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"• “ Six; with each breath, you are relaxing more and more with each exhalation.” • “ Five; we are going all the way down into the deepest level of relaxation.” • “ Four; relax... three, two, one You want to determine the depth of the trance at this stage. If the subject is new to hypnosis, more sessions are usually needed before he/she is able to enter a deep trance. To deepen the trance: • “ Ten; you are becoming even more and more relaxed than before.” • “ Nine; you are descending and drifting down deeper and deeper” • “ Eight; your body is totally and completely relaxed • “ Seven; with each breath, you are relaxing more and more with each exhalation.” • “ Six; we are going down further and further into a deeper and deeper level of relaxation.” • “ Five, four; relax...three, two, one.\" Again, you want to determine the depth of the trance at this stage. If the subject is new to hypnosis, more sessions are usually needed before he/she is able to enter a deep trance. Repeat the steps directly above this paragraph if the subject is still not at the desired level of trance. Here is where you will program the subject’s mind. Make short to the point statements that deal with a specific area or problem. Only work on one problem per session and make sure the problem is resolved before moving onto another. Make all statements to be in the present tense. \"Will\" never comes and the mind does not understand the future tense. For past life regression: Put the subject into a deep trance and say: “I am going to count backward from 10-1.” \"With each number, you will enter a deeper and deeper state of relaxation.\" “When I reach one, you will be standing in front of a door.” Slowly count backwards. “ You are standing in front of a closed door. I am going to count backwards from ten to one and when I reach one, I want you to turn the knob and open the door.\" “....3, 2, 1.\" Now ask the subject if he/she opened the door. If not, he/she is not deep enough into the trance for this session to be effective. Either put MMMDV MMMDX MMMDXV MMMDXX MMMDXXV MMMDXXX MMMDXXXV MMMDXL"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"him/her further under or bring him/her out of the trance and end the session. If he/she opened the door, then say: \"I now want you to walk through the door. You are now in a previous life.” “Look around you, what do you see?” “What is the current date” “Who are you?” Continue talking him/her through the experience When you are ready to bring the person out- “I am going to count from one to five.” “At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, alert and feeling fine.” “1...2...3...4...5” \"Open your eyes.\" If you wish to do a mind wipe, where the subject will not remember anything from the session, be sure to tell them at the end of the session “When you awaken, you will remember nothing of this session.” “Your last memory will be coming through the door.” (Whatever happened before the session). With professional hypnosis, a mind wipe is often necessary of the subject experiences trauma during a regression. Examples: Attracting wealth- “ You are attracting more and more money.” “Your life is filled with wealth and you have everything you want.” (Similar statements for money) For Healing: Have the subject to visualize a bright ball of light like the Sun. Tell him/her to visualize this light on the afflicted body part. \"The light is healing energy, that is healing your______________. Say to the subject: “Visualize a ball of bright light, like the Sun. Do you see the ball of light?\" The subject should answer, “yes.” “ I want you to place the ball of light on your (name of body part).” “ Completely surround (name of body part) with the ball of light, feel the warm energy healing your_____.” “ The light is full of healing energy that is healing your (name of body part).” “ Your______is becoming normal and healthy” Keep talking the subject through this healing process. This may have to be done several times, especially if the problem is chronic.

With standard self-hypnosis, one enters into a trance and makes repeated affirmations to modify behavior. With power hypnosis, one breathes in the energy of a specific color that corresponds to the desired goal. The results are much more extensive and powerful than just plain self-hypnosis. With power hypnosis, we work with our aura. Here is an example of power hypnosis: Say you want to attract money: Breathe in as you would for the energy wave; from all sides of your body at the same time, the color green. A bright, rich vibrant green. This should be done while in as deep as a trance as possible. While breathing in the green and brightening your aura with it affirm: \"I am breathing in powerful energy that is attracting me a lot of free and easy money in a very positive way. This money is free and all mine to keep.\" Say this several times with intent while you breathe in the green. The green is the color of Venus and the heart chakra which rule money. It really works, but has to be done every several days to keep the money coming. Afterwards, breathe in vibrant white light to blance your aura for several breaths. Say you want to lose weight: You would want to use sky blue to speed up your metabolism and affirm: \"I am breathing in blue energy that is speeding up my metabolism in a healthy way and causing me to lose excess body fat.\" You have to repeat this several times anywhere from 5-10 and continue breathing in the blue energy. This will have to be done daily until you see results and repeated whenever necessary. Always make sure you say \"in a positive\" or \"in a healthy\" way. Mind workings always take the easiest route and you don't want to get thin through disease or obtain money through the insurance claim form the loss of a loved one. Be sure to cover all your bases when working with your mind.

This is what we know as the aura. Our thoughts and the activity of our brain form a circuit within that aura. Since thoughts and brain activity are electrical impulses, they can be decoded and read. The world powers are well aware of this and with advanced computer technology, are able to decipher a person's thoughts, where they can be received by a special device and the out put is much like when satellite signals are formed into a picture on our TV sets. There are also microchips that can be used as implants along certain neural pathways to send electrical impulses to the brain, stimulating certain thoughts, feelings, beliefs or implanting certain memories. Although this technology has a way to go, there are now actual thought reading machines, which, like everything else in time, will be perfected. A device is placed upon a subject’s skin at certain points that reads the bioelectrical output and decodes these impulses to where they can easily be read with a special computer. During the 1970's the world powers acquired major advances and breakthroughs in mind control technology. Hypnosis has many positive applications, such as healing or breaking certain habits. Most \"professional\" hypnotists agree that when under a hypnotic trance, the subject will never act against his/her own will or perform acts contrary to his/her own nature. This, in reality is bullshit. A trained and confident operator can impel a subject to do anything he/she commands him/her to do. 20% of the population is perfect subjects for hypnosis. Above average intelligence, the existence of an imaginary playmate in childhood, a strong tendency to daydreaming and fantasy, and the will to comply make one a desirable candidate. In the black arts of hypnotism, the hypnotist and subject form a master/slave relationship. The subject must be isolated from friends and family and spend much time alone with the operator, where a rapport is established, as in government experiments or sometimes as one does with a cellmate in prison. An emotional rapport is very important in establishing trust and obedience. The operator must come across as a good listener and show supposed genuine interest in the subject. The MMMDCXXV MMMDCXXX MMMDCXXXV MMMDCXL MMMDCXLV MMMDCL MMMDCLV MMMDCLX"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"subject is made to feel comfortable around the operator and can be open with him/her. The initial hypnotic induction is the most important, as it breaks through into the subject's mind and opens a door to the hypnotist. When in the alpha state, the logical mind is inactive, and one is open to all suggestions. The operator gives the subject the suggestion that he/she will become deeply hypnotized again whenever the operator gives the induction cue. This can be in words or a signal. Each session induces a deeper hypnotic state where the subject slips under the complete control of the operator. With deeper trances, the subject becomes more and more powerless against the operator. Artificial amnesia (also known as a \"mind wipe\") is induced by the operator suggesting to the subject that he/she will not have any conscious knowledge of the session. Further important suggestions include that the subject will not in any way be able to be hypnotized by anyone else and that he/she will act in a trance, just as if awake. Once the subject is easily hypnotized by the operator, the mind and personality can then be conditioned. Childhood playmates are often extensions of one's personality, especially in those who are of weaker character and would not fight back personally or defend themselves. The imaginary playmate can fight back and get angry, where as the child cannot. Often, there is an abusive parent, to whom the angry thoughts and actions of the playmate are directed against. During the initial conditioning phase of the session, the operator regresses the subject into childhood. Regression plays a very important part in establishing control over the subject. An operator who works for the government as in producing spies, will look for the most aggressive of the imaginary friends, in attempting to artificially split the personality. The most aggressive aspects of the personality are the ideal in destroying all inhibitions. Artificial splitting of the personality occurs where the imaginary playmate is brought out in the subject and the subject becomes the playmate on cue. The playmate usually emerges through one of the subject's chakras. The operator informs the subject that \"playmate's name\" will come through subject's stomach, third eye, throat, etc. The subject is further told again that he/she will not remember anything of the session or the emerging personality. In actual cases, the emerging stronger personality is conditioned through programming and suggestion to be hostile to the root personality of the subject. This aggressive personality in nearly all cases is stronger and can take more abuse. The world powers use the subject as robotic spies. Extensive programming is instilled in the aggressive personality, so that they will never divulge certain information, even under torture. The root personality, who is amnesiac of the entire experience is often the one MMMDCLXV MMMDCLXX MMMDCLXXV MMMDCLXXX MMMDCLXXXV MMMDCXC MMMDCXCV MMMDCC MMMDCCV"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"who endures systematic torture, with no memory or recall of the information the interrogator is attempting to force them to reveal. Through repeated sessions the personality is brought out more and more and becomes much stronger, completely splitting off of the root. The subject, due to being programmed not to remember, has no knowledge, only gaps in time and missing pieces in the memory. Much time slips by unnoticed and is unaccounted for. Further conditioning sessions, while under, include talking the subject through an experience completely abhorrent to their nature, where the subject is made in his/her mind to do something he/she would never consciously do. The subject actually experiences what the operator says. Through repeated sessions, all inhibitions are overcome and the personality is shaped into whatever the operator wishes. This is where the subject, for example, can murder ANYONE without hesitation or do anything else the operator commands. Like anything else, repeated programming is instilled and maintained in subsequent sessions. Barbiturates can be injected into a stubborn subject that will render his/her mind open to whatever suggestions the operator wishes to instill. This is known as \"Military Psychology.\" Charles Manson was known to take less drugs and to be more in control and aware than the other members of his family. This is how he put many under his control, without their knowledge. People on drugs are extremely easy to control either psychically, as a skilled mage would do, or in an actual clinical setting. He learned these methods in prison and applied them. Drug use also puts holes in the protective aura that can easily be manipulated by an adept. Electric Shock Treatment works to destroy memories and can be used to wipe the mind clean by agencies within the world powers. The mind is then reprogrammed, beliefs, ideas, thinking patterns, and habits are instilled, usually through trance induction by drugs, until the new personality takes hold and the drugs are no longer needed. This is known as \"brainwashing\" and can be done for all purposes. Most people are unaware of what can be done to their minds by those who have more knowledge and control. Self-hypnosis is useful in where we, ourselves, program our own minds. We can program our minds to be resistant to all unwanted influences. In addition, others will not be able to influence our minds or establish control over us in any way.

The fight is in the here and now and takes place upon battleground Earth. Satan spoke to me at length on the Eve of Beltane 4/30/05 concerning this. All souls that were residing in Hell in spirit form have all been reincarnated recently and will be joining the ranks of Hell here on Earth. This is total fucking war! For centuries, xians have been relentlessly attacking us and continue to do it to this day. We are persecuted to where we are unable to openly have our own places of Satanic worship in public. We often have to conceal our beliefs and practices from others in order to keep our jobs, avoid major confrontations with our families and to avoid persecution and harassment. Places where we can purchase black candles and other Satanic items are becoming more and more scarce and access to Satanic books of prayer and inspiration are impossible to obtain in the mainstream stores that are flooded with xian filth. We have been turning the cheek for far too long. It is high time we begin to fight back aggressively and with a vengeance. The burning days are over and we have the psychic power. Fundamentalist xians continually brag about \"binding Satan\" \"binding and cursing Demons\" and so forth. They all talk the talk. It is time we show them what *real* binding and cursing is. The burning days are over with and there are no laws against spiritual cursing and other works of psychic retaliation. What you do using the powers of your mind in the privacy of your ritual chamber in or out of doors is legal and free. Satan wants the enemy completely drained of their massive vortex of psychic energy and destroyed. Satan has asked every dedicated Satanist to participate in spiritual warfare. We must work together as a team and like a battering ram, relentlessly attacking the enemy through psychic means. Everyone can do at least one ritual or hook up an energy line and/or direct destructive energy towards the enemy. Many of you who are truly dedicated and able may want to perform a ritual to Satan dedicating your services as a warrior and making a commitment to carry out regular works of psychic destruction against the enemy. Covens can do this as well and the more people involved- the more power. It is important to work in silence and secrecy here. Steel your heart and steel your mind.

The enemy exploits this. This is why the nazarene is usually shown with his arms open. This is to exploit human emotions. We must never forget the Inquisition and what was done to millions of innocent human beings under xian rule. No human being is of more importance to Satan than a warrior is. Satan will reward you profusely as he has with me. Now is the time and Satan is asking each and every one of you to join in the fight and bring the enemy down to their knees and completely destroy them through psychic means. Power meditation is a gift from Satan. It has changed many of our lives for the better. It is time each and every one of us gives something back in gratitude. The more you do for Satan, the more Satan will do for you. Each warrior will receive special recognition and outstanding rank in Hell. As for those who have this complacent \"live and let live\" attitude and prefer to ignore the ever advancing xian problem that curses and blasphemes our God, works to enact laws that are forever taking away our rights and is incessantly fighting against us- these people don't even deserve to be called Satanists. One only needs to type in \"spiritual warfare\" and \"Satan\" together in any search engine to pull up thousands of militant xian websites that prove how they are relentlessly attacking us. So far, most Satanists have turned the other cheek. This needs to be corrected. Spiritual Warfare Training Program for Satanists As for techniques- who and how to psychically attack- ask for guidance from Satan and his Demons. They will lead you to what you need to know. Just be open. This is a simple step-by-step program, that if followed consistently, will produce results within six months. Remember, the six month time period is a major step upward and is a preparation for the higher levels of ability. When you can focus completely and clearly for five minutes, you have reached a competent level. You can work more on these than the minimum in the lessons given. You can do these as often as you wish to advance at a faster rate, but it is very important to stick with this program. I suggest you keep a black book or journal and record your strengths and weaknesses, any notable experiences or impressions or anything you feel is important. Ask yourself how the meditation felt, how you felt afterwards, the next day, any problems you might have had in doing the meditation, etc. MMMDCCCXXX MMMDCCCXXXV MMMDCCCXL MMMDCCCXLV MMMDCCCL MMMDCCCLV MMMDCCCLX MMMDCCCLXV"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"First Month Second Month Third Month Fourth Month It is important to follow the instructions for each day and only do the meditations given. By following this program one can obtain an advanced level of mind power within a six month period. It is very important to start at the beginning. Being able to maintain your full concentration, free of any distracting thoughts with any of the meditations for a full five minutes indicates proficiency. These meditations unfold step by step, each meditation prepares for the next level. It is very important to have a solid foundation as this will prepare one for advanced practices and realization of psychic powers. Frequently Asked Questions: Question: Should you go into a deep trance before doing the rest of the activities? Answer: Only when the instructions tell you to. Remember, it is important to follow the instructions carefully. You can do more of the exercises for a given day to practice if you wish for the first two months. Subsequent meditations will be exceptionally powerful, and must be done gradually. I will note where this applies.

The fictitious nazarene has nothing to do with xmas. Xmas coincides with the Winter Solstice and the Yule season, the shortest day of the year.

Again, the \"Lamb of God\" was stolen from the Zodiac sign of Aries the Ram which occurs every spring. \"All Saint's Day\" corresponds with \"Halloween/Samhain.\" \"Assumption Day\" coincides with \"Lammas Day\" of the \"Summer Solstice.\" For more information see The New Testament and Christian Religion and Exposing Christianity YULE/WINTER SOLSTICE December 22nd-23rd Although the Solstice begins on the 21st-22nd of December, the 23rd is a very special Personal Day for Father.

(This was dictated from him personally). It is the day after the longest night of the year. Again we look foreward to beginnings, as the days will begin to get longer as the year goes on. This is a time for intense celebration and devotion to Lord Satan. Indulgence, decorating the home, family celebrations and get togethers. The Night of Dec. 22nd should be spent in dedication to Satan. This is an excellent time to focus on planning for the year. If one wishes to make personal resolutions this is a good time to do so. At the high point of a ritual or offertory for a Black Mass, personal resolutions can be written on paper and burned. Father is always there to help us in having the strength to carry through with our intentons. After the rite, intense celebrating should take place. The Yule holidays for Satanists are times of indulgence and taking pleasure in the physical and material aspects of life. Actually, xmas trees and wreaths are Pagan in origin, so there is no reason not to celebrate this holiday with our families. Gift giving, baking, decorating. This is what the TRUE Yule season is about, not the filthy nazarene.

We have come to the conclusion, knowing Judaism, Christianity and Islam to be unparalleled and viscious hoaxes upon humanity, that the claims these programs make in regards to the origins of humanity being in the Middle East are lies and cover-ups to further delude and confuse people as to the truth. Spiritual knowledge and teachings came to Egypt and Mesopotamia from the Far East. The Far East is also where Judaism and Christianity STOLE their doctrines from, after corrupting them and replacing them with imposter filth, with the goal to remove all spiritual knowledge from the populace, their trail of lies is replete with the murdered, the tortured, the damned and the spiritual degeneracy of humanity. More and more lies are necessary for these programs to cover up their stinking foundation of corpses, destruction of historical artifacts, and horrendous corruption. When doing any personal research/study on your own regarding the Far East disciplines, it is very important to remember that unfortunately, these have been heavily polluted with Christian filth and lies like just about everything else. The TRUE goal of Satanism [the root word/name \"SAT\" of 'all names and variations of Satan' means \"TRUTH\" in Sanskrit, which is one of the worlds oldest languages], is to advance our souls and to empower ourselves. Meaningless crap such as references to certain 'morality' and 'personal conduct' should be weeded out as dross. These in truth have nothing whatsoever to do with obtaining the powers of the mind and soul. Knowledge and application of that knowledge is the only key. \"Right up to the thirteenth century, Yantra-Tantra practises thrived on a widespread basis in the whole of Eastern India. In the Thirteenth century, muslim invaders destroyed the famed universities and centres of learning of Yantra-Tantra and ruined thousands of volumes of literature in the form of books, manuscripts and icons. People practising the art of Yantra-Tantra were massacred and those who were able to save their lives escaped to South India, Assam and countries like Nepal, Tibet, Burma, Ceylon and Java. In more recent times, the Chinese invaders who plundered Tibet further destroyed the monasteries and literature of Yantra-Tantra.\" Reference: Power of Mantra and Yantra by P.

Much has been destroyed. Satan leads us to the truth through our own study and through opening our souls and minds. IMPORTANT! MOST OF THE TEACHINGS AND DOCTRINES OF THE ANCIENT RELIGIONS HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED. IGNORE THEM. THE EXERCISES, SUCH AS THOSE IN HATHA AND KUNDALINI YOGA, BREATHING EXERCISES, MARTIAL ARTS EXERCISES, ETC., THESE ARE ANOTHER MATTER AND THEY ARE VERY POWERFUL IN RAISING THE SO- CALLED WITCHPOWER, VRIL, CHI. THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF SATANISM. The Roots and Origins of True Satanism After years of research into Satanism, we have found the origins are in the Far East. When beginning research into Satanism, one usually will look to Western Occultism. Western Occultism has been thoroughly corrupted and infested with Jewish filth. Nearly everything in Western Occultism has its roots in the Far East. Western Occultism is chock full of Hebrew letters, numerology, angels and other filth. Our original Gods who gave us spiritual knowledge are blasphemed and made to hideous monsters. When tracing all of this back to its origins in the Far East, the names of our Gods in Sanskrit are revered and held in the high esteem they deserve. The name \"Satan\" which means \"enemy\" in Hebrew, means TRUTH and CREATOR GOD in Sanskrit. Of course, the people of lies would deem TRUTH as their mortal enemy. Civilization did not begin in the Middle East as we are led to believe. Sumeria, Egypt, and other ancient civilizations obtained their spiritual teachings and occult knowledge from the Far East. The modern paperback edition of the Necronomicon; in the preface, the editors even admit to this text having its origins in Sanskrit. Anyone with knowledge of Sanskrit can see this is true with many of the words and names in that book. Satanist Heinrich Himmler knew the truth about our spiritual origins in the Far East, and sent an expedition to Tibet, where the Germans were very well received. The expedition brought back around 30 Tibetan Buddhist Monks to Berlin, all of whom died in a group ritual suicide in the spring of 1945, with the fall of the Third Reich. True Satanism can be found in Kundalini [Serpent] Yoga, and Left Hand Path Tantra. Unfortunately, like with everything else, there have been some corruptions in the above-mentioned disciplines, where the Jewish tool of Christianity has infested, but most of you who are dedicated to Satan will feel the truth in the basic doctrines.

The end result is communism, which is the final removal of all spiritual/occult knowledge from the Gentile populace, while Jewish masters assume the position of 'God.' In preparation for all of this, nearly every single page of the Judeo/Christian Bible has the word 'Jew' 'Jews' and/or 'Israel' on it. Their agenda is based upon taking names, places, important dates, and concepts from Gentiles and replacing them with their fictitious characters, archetypes, and corrupted teachings, to disarm us spiritually. They use these lies to claim they were the founders of all religion, civilization, and spiritual teachings, the greatest of their lies is that of being 'The Chosen of God.' Much of this is also subliminal. Exclusively Jewish schools where the Jews learn to argue and obtain the knowledge they need to destroy Gentiles, are called \"Shivas.\" The name was stolen from the masculine power of the Kundalini, the consort of the feminine Shakti. In other words, the brains that direct the spiritual power to manifest on the material plane in a specific way. Those who are knowledgable here can readily see the connection. Many textbooks, even at college level claim Judaism to be the oldest of religions, which is a LIE. A prime example of using a fictitious history is the state of Palestine. They obtained this state through LIES. Ever since, the Palestinian people have suffered horribly. There has never been any peace in the Middle East with the establishment of the bandit state of Israel. These lies have given the Jewish people special privileges and a history they are NOT entitled to. Occult power is within us all. By removing this knowledge and keeping it for themselves, the Jews can throw a curse at whomever they choose, and the Gentile victim is helpless without any knowledge or spiritual power. They have even bragged about this and more in the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, stating the aura of protection they have put around their entire people, so when the shit really comes down on all of the Gentiles [fighting each other, because of Jewish instigation], their own will be protected. Christianity not only removes spiritual knowledge and replaces it with Jewish lies, but also self-perpetuates through the use of the energies of the believers. This powerful Jewish tool must be destroyed, as its end result is Jewish communism, as can be readily seen in the biblical message as a whole and in the sermons of the Jewish invented character of the nazarene.

The Mayan connection makes sense. We believe that 2012 may be the year when Gentiles as a whole wake up to the Jewish SPELL and HOAX of Christianity. A Jewish rabbi once stated that the Hebrew letter 'Vau' that is in their numerology a six, is also the Semitic W. WWW [World Wide Web of the internet] equals '666' which the Jews have named 'The Beast.' The information on the internet cannot be controlled. This will be their undoing. In closing, I would like to add some very important information concerning the Eastern teachings we now have available to us today. Like with most everything, much of what we have today has been infested with Christian lies, no different from the 'New Age' teachings, which are Christianized Paganism and witchcraft. When researching Kundalini Yoga and Left Hand Path Tantra, one can see in the essence, the symbols, the mantras, the words, and the techniques, the Satanic essense and foundation here. The most important thing one can do when reading anything of yoga is to realize that much of what we now have available to us has been corrupted. There are no 'Laws' as such. All of the crap on celibacy, abstaining from eating certain foods, observing certain virtues, lack of desire and detachment, and related, is not only dross, but very harmful advice in many respects. I have done enough studying, along with personal experience to know this. In addition, that 'absence of desire' that keeps cropping up in many of Eastern teachings [that have been corrupted with Christian filth], that alone- one can see is total bullshit and lies. Total absence of desire = death. If one actually had 'no desires' then one would not meditate, nor would one work towards advancing one's self and seeking enlightenment. One would be dead. These false teachings are there to disarm and prevent those who acquire power from the above disciplines from using it. Using our powers through both white and black magick is what the enemy fears the most. This is why these teachings have been corrupted. As for absence of desire, the only truth in this is if one does the exercises faithfully, this will stop cravings for mind-altering drugs and related vices. True Left Hand Path Tantra is living life to the fullest, indulgence in pleasure, while working towards enlightenment through meditation and knowledge- the Satanic way. Many books about yoga contradict each other, which reveals corrputed information. You have to open your mind and like with reading anything- read through it the Satanic way- sift out the xian bullshit that unfortunately has infested nearly everything.

The essence of these teachings are all about developing the powers of the mind and soul, which are open to everyone in the universe. You don't have to live your life by certain laws. Energy does what it is told to do. The only thing one needs is accurate knowledge. The knowledge on how to get there and how to be the most powerful you can be. As Satanists, we work towards: • Developing and advancing the powers known as 'Siddhis', such as telekinesis, telepathy, levitation, and so forth. These are gifts to us from Satan. • Development of our personal powers in causing desired changes in our lives and/or in the lives of others using the powers of our minds and souls. • Using any powers we obtain from doing yoga, meditation, mantra, etc., to enhance our lives, establish justice if we are wronged, acquire wealth, heal and/or anything else we desire.

I will get to the point. Nearly everyone knows about how the enemy works through infiltration to destroy and corrupt spiritual knowledge. The roots and foundations of True Satanism can be found in Kundalini [SERPENT] Yoga. Unfortunately, many of the teachings have been infested with procedures and practices that are designed to make damned good and sure anyone who follows them will not have any personal powers. A good example of this is the numerous practitioners of yoga who have been indoctrinated with lies, many namely in India, who own nothing, live in a shelter nothing more than a glorified dog house, cover themselves with ashes from the dead, only wear a 'christ rag' and live a death like existence. Tourists, who visit ashrams and temples, for a few cents given to these pathetic beggars, receive their 'blessings' which is their giving of their own life force and energies. These poor souls are filled with much spiritual power, but have no idea on how to use it, due to the enemy teachings deliberately misguiding them. There aren't really any rules in obtaining personal power except for consistent meditations and doing the necessary work to advance one's self spiritually. Enemy corrupted crap is blatant.

Following these enemy corruptions will only make sure you have no powers and that you are not a threat to their agenda of using occult powers to enslave the world. The worst is self-mutilation and related practices, which are not only insane but potentially deadly. The only 'SIN' in Satanism is that of STUPIDITY!! • Cutting the underside of the tongue so that the tongue can reach back up into the pineal gland. This is not only very dangerous, but totally unnecessary! Fools who have done this can no longer speak normally, nor eat properly. Texts that laborate on this mutilation relate that the mutilated one normally \"retires to live in a cave, cannot speak normally, nor eat very much food at all.\" One can obviously choke to death. This is total insanity! Anyone who has meditated consistently and extensively upon his/her pineal gland knows this is totally foolish and unnecessary. • Swallowing a long cloth/rag.

Human beings are social by nature and have a need to be touched and loved sexually. Orgasm is a necessary release. SEXUAL ABSTINENCE IS EXTREMELY UNHEALTHY! If one is unable to find a suitable partner, it is important that sexual energy in the form of a good orgasm be relieved as needed by one's self. This is personal and individual. Denying one's self sexual orgasm usually leads to not only serious psychological problems, but physical problems as well and contrary to those popular yogic teachings, celibacy actually impedes spiritual progress. • Another one is diet. This is an individual choice. A vegetarian diet is not at all necessary in practicing yoga or in developing one's spiritual powers. This is pushed in nearly all texts on yoga and in many other writings. What you eat is your own personal choice. Of course anyone who has a consistent diet of fast and junk food – this leads to ill health eventually, but as for over-eating on occasion, eating spicy foods, meats and so forth, this has absolutely nothing to do with any interfering on your spiritual progress. I speak from my own experience here. • Ignoring the feet and lower chakras. The lower chakras are essential. If you want to heal yourself, perform ANY magick, and have decent self-esteem, you MUST have powerful lower chakras. The reasons most popular and readily available yoga texts now a days advise against developing the lower chakras is to see to it you have no personal powers. The feet are also very important, as this is where one pulls in energy to use for rituals and in healing others and much more. • Ignoring the Siddhis Any siddhis should be worked on and developed. This is what kundalini yoga and spirituality are all about. • The need for a human \"Guru\" [spiritual teacher] Again, this is unnessary. Much of this sort of thing is often a money- making gimmick, and in many cases, the blind leading the blind. Satan and his Demons are our \"Gurus.\" They are the REAL Masters.

Persecution has always been an issue in hiding important spiritual concepts within legends, epics and other stories of the Gods [ALLEGORIES], in the belief that the Gods will lead their own to the real meanings. While the Gods are real E.T. beings, each one also has an important spiritual concept in their name, sigil and story of their life here on earth. Below in alphabetical order is a list of spiritual code-words to know when doing personal research. When knowing their meanings, most often, many writings and texts come to light. Detachment = This comes with meditation. Unfortunately, this word has been really corrupted in most meditation texts. What happens with consistent meditation, one is not affected by one's environment like others who do not meditate. For example, in emergency situations, the meditator is able to remain 'detached' and keep a cool head. One does not get rattled/upset. Gate/s = Chakras God, Gods = The Gods are code-words for the Chakras. \"God\" is a code word for the self Heaven = The crown chakra [Christians stole this concept from Taosim and corrupted it, as with 'Hell'] MMMMCCCXXX MMMMCCCXXXV MMMMCCCXL MMMMCCCXLV MMMMCCCL MMMMCCCLV MMMMCCCLX MMMMCCCLXV"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Hell = The Base chakra [Christians stole this concept from Taosim and corrupted it, as with 'Heaven'] The base chakra is the seat of the serpent Kundalini and is hot when activated. Pray/Prayer = Either telepathic communication with our Gods OR reciting a mantra/words of power to accomplish a goal Purification = Cleaning one's aura before a ritual or working. This helps in having a freer flow of energy to accomplish the goal. The aura is cleansed of any conflicting energies that act to impede the new energy. Surrender = Another word that has been hideously corrupted. All this means is during meditation, one needs to totally relax and let go to access the female part of the soul and brain. Also- this is important after doing a working- just let go and do not dwell on the outcome, as worry, etc., hampers the energy. Worship = Meditation, total focus upon an object, mantra, sigil, etc., to achieve a goal. This DOES NOT have to do with slavish fawning before a 'diety.' © Copyright 2009, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 Powers of the Mind and Soul MMMMCCCLXX MMMMCCCLXXV MMMMCCCLXXX MMMMCCCLXXXV"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The esssence of TRUE Satanism is completing our Creator God Satan's work upon humanity. Satan was prevented from finishing his work on humanity: that of the human soul into the godhead. The \"godhead\" is spiritual and physical perfection and immortality, along with godlike powers, wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. This is the underlying message of all of the legitimate occult disciplines, such as alchemy and the legends of the Gods which are all allegories containing this powerful message. At first mention for those who are inexperienced with witchcraft (using the powers of one's own mind and soul to obtain one's desires), images of old hags with pointed black hats, broomsticks, bats, cauldrons, frogs, toads, amulets, sacred stones, symbols, etc., pour forth in one's mind. The powers one uses are the powers of his/her own mind and soul, to begin with. The above mentioned, many are just useless props, such as a cauldron. Others, such as amulets, rings of stones and so forth amplify energy. Covens (groups of witches/warlocks) can be extremely powerful in amplifying energy, as many gifted people work together to apply these powers, many in the case of where one working alone could not accomplish certain workings. Raising energy and direction of that energy in obtaining desires, whatever they may be, is what witchcraft is all about. We often see circles along with astrological glyphs and other occult symbols in the movies and such. Astrological timing of raising and directing energy is often critical to the success of a working and greatly amplifies the powers. Witches and warlocks [mages](those who use the powers of their minds and souls and have this knowlege) use whatever means they can to amplify their powers. This is important. Demons and spiritual assistants often use frogs, toads and other animals called \"familiars\" to assist mages in their work, and communicate through the medium of an animal, which is always very well cared for and close to the mage; a powerful bond is formed. The familiar also offers protection and is a gift from Satan. Summary: 1. True Satanism is working to advance one's mind and soul and personal powers. 2. \"Witchcraft\" is using these powers, which are of the mind/soul. Symbols, amulets, stones and other props act to amplify the energy, either directly, or indirectly for those who prefer to use imagery to intensify their powers. © Copyright 2007, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 MMMMCCCXC MMMMCCCXCV MMMMCD MMMMCDV MMMMCDX MMMMCDXV MMMMCDXX MMMMCDXXV"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Three Steps of Witchcraft This article is basically for new people or a getting back to basics. While there is no \"three-fold law,\" (Click here to read about The \"Three-fold Law of Return\" Exposing This Lie and its Origins) there are three basic STEPS to working magick. 1. You raise the energy 2. You program the energy 3. You direct the energy. When you begin directing the energy, you should continue to program it, while you visualize it doing what you want it to do. Let's begin with step one. First, you have to have energy to work with, the stronger, the better. The stronger your own energy, the more energy you will naturally be able to raise, direct, and handle. The more experienced you are, the easier this becomes. All of this is like working a muscle. The more you work with it, the stronger it becomes. For white magick (this is best to work with for newbies, black magick requires more experience and skill) you will more than likely want to use your own energy and connect with the working. Using Runes and vibration is one of the quickest and most powerful ways of raising energy. Other ways are using the foundation meditation or through just visualization. You raise the energy and should feel it strongly, throughout your entire body. With Step Two, you must program the energy. By \"program,\" I mean you must tell it what you want it to do. Energy all by itself is pretty much neutral and inert. With step two, you must use what are called \"affirmations.\" \"Affirmations\" are short, to the point phrases in the present tense that are repeated to program the energy. The present tense must be used because energy does not have the reasoning power to understand \"will happen.\" \"Will\" can be at any time. For example: You don't want to say \"_____ will come to me.\" Instead, you want to say \"________IS coming to me.\" Energy does not have the reasoning power as to *HOW* what you want is coming to you. Energy takes the path of least resistance, unless it is programmed. For example, many of you want more money. Don't just affirm \"Money is coming to me.\" This could manifest, if undirected, say on a job where you handle money, like a cashier for example, or through your paycheck, as usual. That is the easiest way. You have to further affirm: \"Large amounts of free and easy money are coming to me.\" \"This money is all mine to keep and spend as I wish.\" You also should affirm \"in a very positive and happy way for me.\" You don't want a loved one to die and leave you an inheritance or get the money in a way that would be MMMMCDXXX MMMMCDXXXV MMMMCDXL MMMMCDXLV MMMMCDL MMMMCDLV MMMMCDLX MMMMCDLXV"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"unpleasant. So your affirmation would go something like this: \"Large amounts of free and easy money are coming to me, This money is all mine to keep and spend as I wish. This money is coming to me in a very positive and happy way for me.\" Affirmations should be repeated with intent, five to ten times or more, in your mind. You can also visualize energy as with step three, throughout the day and state your affirmations a few times to reinforce the working. ALWAYS REMEMBER: ENERGY TAKES THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE AND DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REASON. Another example is weight loss. You don't want to wind up getting seriously ill, as this is one of the easiest ways to drastically lose weight. Your mind can do it for you when properly programmed, for example affirm: \"I am losing weight in a very positive and healthy way for me.\" With step three, you direct the energy. You do this through visualization. Energy using white magick should be visualized as a white-gold light, shining brilliant like the Sun. You need to visualize this brilliant energy either around your entire self and/or around whatever it is that you want. Visualize in your mind whatever it is OCCURRING NOW and visualize the energy lighting it up. For example, with attracting money, you would want to visualize the money (your wallet full, or whatever), even *feel* and *smell* the money, touch it; the more realistic and the more astral senses you use, the more effective this will be, and infuse it with as much energy as you can, the more brilliant, the better, using your visualization. Feel happy emotions. For health, direct the energy to the afflicted organ, and visualize yourself as healthy and happy. Again, FEEL happy, while you are doing the working, as if it is already so. Now, forget about the working and try to think of other things. This can be difficult in desperate situations, but do the best you can, because worry and obsessing over a working can undo the energy you put into it. Just let it go and know it is working. The only exception to this is, I already went over in the above: You can also visualize energy as with step three, throughout the day and state your affirmations a few times to reinforce the working. Just don't obsess over it, as this is a lack of faith in your own power and can dilute the energy or ruin the working. This sort of thing takes practice like anything else. Now, for black magick, you do not want to come into contact with any negative energy you raise. Those who do not have knowledge do this sort of thing and suffer many times for it. The answer to everything is MMMMCDLXX MMMMCDLXXV MMMMCDLXXX MMMMCDLXXXV MMMMCDXC MMMMCDXCV MMMMD MMMMDV"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"knowledge. Now, I am speaking from my own experience here. Most popular grimoires and such will tell you to use black energy. In my own experience, I have found grey energy to be the most devastating. Grey energy is also death energy. It causes illnesses and all sorts of negative things. For example, a death spell. I speak from experience here. Take the death energy from a cemetery or anywhere there is death and pull it out of the ground, using visualization. Program it, as in step two, for example, \"The grey death energy is killing_______.\" Do this while you are putting it on the individual you wish to do away with. I have also found through direct experience, this must be done many times on a regular basis. I also want to add, most popular writings will instruct you to raise as much emotion, such as anger and hatred as possible. Again, this is ok, but not necessary. What is necessary are the strength of your own soul, your will and directing the energy. On a lesser note, those who deliberately try to do you harm in your life, simply direct their own energy right back to them, using the grey tones. Sit back and watch them suffer and revel in it. © Copyright 2007, Joy of Satan Ministries; Library of Congress Number: 12-16457 Satanic Sacraments MMMMDX MMMMDXV MMMMDXX MMMMDXXV MMMMDXXX"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"People have asked me why I advocate making a commitment to Satan.

In other religions, the sacraments are false. This is proven by the fact that those who receive them can just walk out or \"backslide\" and leave at any time. They have no power or bond. They are in reality, worthless. When we make a commitment to Satan, he takes us and our word seriously. This is real and permanent as it should be. The initiation ritual also represents a test of character. Strength is so important. Our character is tested when we give our souls to Father. Here we take one of the most courageous steps of our lives. Many of us go up against everything we have been indoctrinated with throughout our lives with bold defiance. Here we show our true character, that we are not manipulated by fears, threats and things we truly do not understand. This is a huge spiritual step in liberation of the self and soul and prepares us for the intense inner growth and spiritual evolution that comes with being a true Satanist.

It is important for everyone of us to know the law and our legal rights concerning our beliefs. Here are some important tips and guidelines to follow that pertain to Spiritual Satanists: 1. If you ever find yourself incarcrated (in jail) ANYWHERE, keep your beliefs to yourself. The authorities in these places, like it or not, DO have it over on you and can do as they please with you for as long as you remain in custody. 2. In these places, a counselor or psychologist will more than likely interview you. Keep it simple. Sound as though you are a sheep and conform. These individuals do not and will not recognize psychic phenomena, spirituality (unless it is moderate and MAINSTREAM, ie, xianity, judaism, islam). Most are trained as atheists or are xtians and openly discussing your beliefs, practices or gifted abilities will result in a full psychiatric evaluation. 3. Coming to the attention of a psychiatrist M.D., will result in being labeled as insane, given psychiatric drugs against your will (they can put them in your food) and you will be sent to a psychiatric ward, to be incarcerated there. Any little thing you do or say there will label you insane, unless you act as though you completely conform. 4. As for black magick, the burning days are over. The authority labels this sort of thing as bunk, on the lunatic fringe and does not recognize such phenomena. BUT, DO NOT make threats to anyone. Making threats of any kind IS illegal. If you wish to place a curse on someone, keep this to yourself and DO IT, don't talk or brag about it BEFOREHAND, as they can get you on MAKING THREATS, HARASSMENT and INTIMIDATION. When the damage is done, they can't do a fucking thing. CONCERNING EMPLOYMENT: Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers in the US are prohibited from from discriminating against individuals because of their religion in hiring, firing, and other terms and conditions of employment. It also requires employers to reasonably accommodate the religious practices of an employee, unless to do so would create an undue hardship on the employer. You have the right to practice your religion to the same level as everyone else in your workplace. Everyone should ask his/her Human Resources personnel or other representatives for a MMMMDLXXX MMMMDLXXXV MMMMDXC MMMMDXCV"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"copy of your employers policy regarding religion in the workplace. There are many places who do not have this, but in places that do, this is a major help. Read it thoroughly and keep it in a safe place at home. Basic Rights include: Holiday Observances - unless an employer can prove that it will cause undue hardship, they must allow observances of religious holidays. Employers are also restricted from inquiring about an employee's future availability at certain times. Dress Code - employers may not maintain a restrictive dress code in direct conflict with an employee's religious obligations. Discrimination - it is illegal for an employer to fire or refuse to hire an employee based solely on their religion. It is also illegal for employees to be passed over for promotion, excluded from special training programs, or demoted for religious reasons. In 1997, Pres. Clinton issued guidelines for federal employees (government workers) regarding religion in the workplace. Although they are only applicable to federal workers, these guidelines have been used by many business as a framework for their own religious policies. The guidelines include: Expression in Private Work Areas - Religious expressions in areas not open to the public are respected in the same way that non religious expressions are allowed. Specifically, members are allowed to have religious literature at their desks and include religious icons or posters in their work area.* *Now this is for federal employees in the USA and may not apply to most private industry jobs. Expression Among Fellow Employees: Employees are entitled to discuss their religious views privately, as long as those views are not harassing to fellow workers. They are also entitled to display religious messages on clothing, an wear religious medallions or jewelry outside of their clothing. Coercion of Employees - a supervisor is not permitted to use his or her position of authority to coerce employees to change their behavior regarding religion. Supervisors are not allowed to require employee attendance at religious events or use religious factors to determine an employee's status in the company. Harassment - employees are protected from the use of repeated derogatory or inflammatory comments about their religion, whether by supervisors or fellow employees. This includes repeated harassment or unwelcome proselytization, exclusion of the employee from work groups, or repeated verbal attacks. Unfortunately, harassment and discrimination do exist in the workplace despite the guidelines and laws passed in the USA.

No one should be forced to contend with a hostile work environment, yet many of alternative faiths 'take it' daily, fearing reprisals or firing should they speak up. By taking a few precautions, you can excercise your rights to religious expression without fear of reprisal from supervisors or coworkers. Your EO Officer - Most larger firms employ an Equal Opportunity Officer. This person is in charge of making sure that the company complies with all of the EEOC guidelines and regulations. If you practice a minority religion, or one that is often misunderstood by the general public, make sure that your EO officer understands the facts about your faith BEFORE any problems arise. \"Good Employee\" - the most common ruse to rid a workplace of an unwanted employee is \"poor performance\". Make sure that you're prepared! If you receive notes or post-it notes commending your work, keep them in a file with the date and nature of the work. Keep your awards and commendations, along with dates. Keep these at home and in a safe place. If you are fired for poor performance, your file will be invaluable in proving your case. Pocket Journal - if someone makes a rude or derogatory comment about your faith, write it down in a small notebook, along with the date, time, place, and any witnesses to the conversation. Not only will it discourage harassment, but you will also have a record of repeated offenses should you ever need to complain to your superiors. Keep a backup copy at home in a safe place. Religious expression in the office is a balance between faith and business. Don't attempt to make your work area into a \"temple away from home\". Use coworkers examples and office policy to determine what you should, or shouldn't, place on your desk and walls. Don't Apologize - you have the right to your beliefs. If someone starts a religious discussion that you don't like, tell them politely that you aren't interested. Xtains stating they will \"pray\" for you is harrassment and intimidation in legal terms on the job. If they persist, inform them of your civil rights and refer them to the EEOC guidelines on religion in the workplace. If that doesn't work, report them to a superior. Remember to keep a record of all of the details- names of everyone concerned, date, time, place, etc. Sometimes, even the strongest warnings and complaints have little or no effect on discrimination. In that case, you may need to report your employer to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) LINK the government agency charged with protecting your civil rights.

Facts About Religious Discrimination LINK RIGHTS FOR KIDS AND TEENS ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE USA: For those of you who attend public schools in the USA, the constitution protects you and enforces seperation of church and state. Many schools, especially in the area known as the \"bible belt\" will try any way they can to get around these laws. It is important to keep a record, same as adults who are facing discrimmination in the workplace. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that everyone in the United States has the right to practice his or her own religion, or no religion at all. It is important to know your rights. People who violate these rights are breaking the law and are subject to disciplinary measures same as anyone else. It is important not to just let it go, or look the other way. If everyone ignored violations of their civil rights, no one would be free. Xtians are notorious for coercing their religious beliefs upon kids and teens; using fear, bribes and all kinds of other unethical tactics to snare young minds. In a public school setting, THIS IS ILLEGAL!! IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO TEACH RELIGION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Public schools are run by the government and funded by the tax payers. They must obey the First Amendment. This means that while they can teach ABOUT the influences of religion in history, literature and philosophy, BUT, they can't PROMOTE religious beliefs or practices as part of the school curriculum. Since private and parochial schools aren't run by the government, the First Amendment doesn't apply to them. Students have the legal right to be excused from some school activities if they conflict with their religious beliefs. A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER IS FORBIDDEN FROM STARTING THE DAY OR A MEETING WITH PRAYER Any prayers, scriptural readings and loudspeaker devotionals violate the First Amendment because they PROMOTE RELIGION. This is true even if the prayer is \"non-denominational\" (not of any particular religion.) Moments of silence might be unconstitutional -- it depends on whether or not the real reason they're being held is to encourage prayer. STUDENT LED PRAYER IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS WELL.

The Romans, who had been tolerant to all religions, were now told by an edict of Emperor Constantine that Christianity was now the supreme religion of the empire to the exclusion of all others. Still No Bible at 300 A.D. At this time the Christian movement, although nearly 300 years old, still did not have a written text or Bible. Under the powerful direction of Emperor Constantine a convocation of church fathers was called. At this meeting a number of scripts and writings were put together and a heated controversy ensued over a period of several months. Many writings were considered, discussed, argued over, and reviewed. Some were revised, some were rewritten, some were rejected. The final package that emerged from the Council of Nicaea was what was called the New Testament, a contradictory, demented conglomeration of far-out nonsense. To it was patched the Jewish Old Testament. The Christian movement now had a Bible, with Constantine as final arbiter. Constantine exercised the full powers of his position,financially, militarily and in terms of legal enforcement to now promote Christianity and crush all opposition. Christianity was now on its way. When we examine what substantiated evidence that exists for the basic claims of Christianity and the actual historical existence of the central figure of Jesus Christ himself, we find there is no evidence whatsoever. Again, none whatsoever that has the slightest basis in fact. The Christian church, which in the first few centuries grew into the Roman Catholic Church, guaranteed its own authenticity. It claims its principal authority from the gospels, based on Matthew 16:18 in which Jesus purportedly gives the church its charter: And I say also untothee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church: and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. The Roman Catholic church claims it is the church referred to, and has its credentials from Jesus Christ himself. So who guarantees the authenticity of the gospels? Why, the Roman Catholic church does. Who guarantees the authenticity and authority of the Roman Catholic church? Why, the gospels do. A perfect example of ridiculous \"logic\". DESTROYING OUR PAST!! Most of us here know Christianity is a hoax, but to what extent is another matter. It is a hoax of catastrophic proportions. A study of Medieval Paintings reveals a cry for help. Many of the artists of the period left messages in their work. There are quite a few paintings- all of Christian religious matter (this was not an option of the artist as the Catholic Church had total control, and nearly every work of art during that period had to be of Christian religious themes, lest the artist be charged with \"heresy\" which meant torture and death) that reveal flying saucers hovering over the nazarene and other signs that this foul religion was a hoax and the people knew it, but were severely oppressed. Grey clouds obscuring the Sun in the painting \"Calling of the first Apostles\" by Domenico Ghirlandaio, 1481, reveals a dismal atmosphere that indicates a sad occasion and says plenty. Carlo Crivelli's painting of the Annunciation in 1486 blatantly reveals a UFO hovering over the virgin and beaming a stream of light into her head.

Of course, it is just fine for Israel and the USA to have all the weapons of mass destruction they please with no outside interference whatsoever. We all know Mr. Bush is a \"born again\" Christian. The real reason behind all of this seems to point towards the destruction of important ancient relics and documents that *prove* Judaism, and Christianity are lies. Saddam Hussein believed himself to be the reincarnation of Nebuchadnezzar. With this belief, he spent some $500 million dollars during the 1980's attempting to reconstruct Ancient Babylon, the capitol of Nebuchadnezzar. Over sixty million bricks were created to replace the walls of Babylon with the engraving \"To King Nebuchadnezzar in the reign of Saddam Hussein.\" ¹ There were many ancient temples and relics buried beneath the sands of Iraq that were proof of the origins of humanity. Whether they are still there given the invasion is unknown. American and British GI's were given the go ahead from the top brass to destroy and/or loot whatever they pleased from the Iraqi museums. Saddam Hussein was also working on restoring the Ancient Ashurbanipal Library, which was the earliest known collected and catalogued library in the world. The texts therein originated before the flood. British archeologists in the mid 19th century at Nineveh excavated some 25,000 cuneiform tablets assembled by King Ashurbanipal which nearly all of are now in the British Museum. In April of 2002, the Iraqi archeologists asked the British Museum if they would allow casts of the tablets to be made. Though copies were made in the past of certain tablets, this would have been the first time any significant number would have been made available as copies. The proposed reconstructed library at Nineveh would have held copies of all of the tablets from the British Museum and was planned to be a center for scholars and a tourist attraction. Next door to the library was to be a center for cuneiform study. Plans were also made to excavate one of the wings of King Ashurbanipal's Palace in Kuyunjik Mound where it was hoped that thousands of other buried tablets would be found.

As for the virgin, this entity stole everything from Astaroth while Astaroth was bound. ² Ibid. Excerpts from links below concerning Archeological Cover ups: \"Smithsonian at one time had actually taken a barge full of unusual artifacts out into the Atlantic and dumped them in the ocean.\" \"Historian and linguist Carl Hart, editor of WORLD EXPLORER, then obtained a hiker's map of the Grand Canyon from a bookstore in Chicago. Poring over the map, we were amazed to see that much of the area on the north side of the canyon has Egyptian names. The area around Ninety-four Mile Creek and Trinity Creek had areas (rock formations, apparently) with names like Tower of Set, Tower of Ra, Horus Temple, Osiris Temple, and Isis Temple. In the Haunted Canyon area were such names as the Cheops Pyramid, the Buddha Cloister, Buddha Temple, Manu Temple and Shiva Temple.

However, the Smithsonian denies that any such discovery ever occurred. This brings up the larger question that if this was a true story, why would the Smithsonian have covered up what certainly would be one of the most significant archeological finds of the twentieth century? Believe it or not, there is precedence for the Smithsonian losing information about discoveries that are deemed to not fit in with currently accepted dogma about the history of America and its interaction or lack thereof with other ancient civilizations.\"  So Mote It Be  Hail Satan!
