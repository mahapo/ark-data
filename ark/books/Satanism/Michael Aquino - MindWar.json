Seese, Psy.D. Major, Psychological Operations, U.S. Army The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. - John Milton, Paradise Lost The concept of MindWar (MW) represents a holistic and pro-active approach to Psychological Operations (PSYOP), rather than the traditional reactionary role to which it’s been relegated. MW focuses on emerging and anticipating problems, situations, and conditions affecting the Information Environment (IE) not only to manage the perceptions of groups and individuals, but to address the conditions and situations that fuel discontent and drive instability. Targeting only the symptoms of a problem, rather than addressing the underlying causes and conditions, results in only a temporary and short-term solution. This shortsighted approach has proven costly, has limited effectiveness, and does not bring about nor foster long-term change. MW provides the capability to resolve problems before they begin. Utilizing 21st century scientifically-valid, empirically-based methodologies, MW is the equivalent of a mental preemptive strike. To be effective, MW requires a detailed analysis of an anticipated or emerging situation, focusing on the physical, information, and cognitive domains. Only this combined approach will result in a necessary understanding of the underlying issues that need to be addressed for MW effectiveness. MW can be used to address not only traditional problems such as war and conflict, but also the full range of asymmetric threats (terrorism, violent extremism, drug and human trafficking), the - 15 -"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"challenges associated with globalization (migration, spread of disease, overpopulation), and the social and economic problems resulting from the physical effects of climate change (crop failure, economic volatility, and resource competition). MW further has the potential to support the major end states of the Strategic Framework for Stabilization and Reconstruction 1 outlined by the US Institute of Peace that were adopted by the U.S. Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute for use in the conduct of civil military operations. These end states were framed according to the perception of the host nation population, as they will be the final arbiters of whether peace has been achieved. This book proposes a conceptual and operational design for the development of a MW capability. It discusses a pragmatic, multiphase model as the framework for its execution, and reviews a body of research conducted over the last 30 years that exemplifies creative and out-of-the-box thinking. 1 United States Institute for Peace and United States Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute, Guiding Principles for Stabilization and Reconstruction .

Clarke Since the first caveman beaned another one with a rock, violence against the bodies and belongings of others (hereinafter “PhysWar”/PW) has been a constant and until now accepted method of addressing, if not resolving disputes between tribes, feudal holdings, and eventually nation-states. Indeed PW has been glorified and its participants honored, despite its being an engine of death, destruction, and misery. Certainly no other human pastime has been more publicized and memorialized in literature and the arts. A visit to any library or museum is sufficient to demonstrate that, despite all rhetoric to the contrary, humanity loves the mystique of war . The problem with this addiction is not merely one of compassion for PW’s victims. If PW had a record of positive accomplishment - resolving the issues that prompted it - it could at least be excused on these grounds. 2 But this is rarely, indeed almost never the case. The moment that cooperative, reasoned dialogue is discarded in favor of brute force, the inexorable tendency is to reject anything other than that blind force henceforth. Negotiation, compromise, and rational problem-solving are abandoned, indeed condemned as signs of weakness and betrayal. 2 In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. - Harry Lime, The Third Man , 1949 - 17 -"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"As humanity has advanced technologically, the weapons of PW have become more efficient, projectable, and lethal. But whether it is an industrial nation with armed forces deployed worldwide, or guerrilla conflicts [the currently-in-vogue term is “terrorism”] using hand-to- hand combat, the allure has not slackened in the least. Humanity still craves, and loves, war. 3 The 21st-century dilemma for the United States is simply that PW is no longer practical on the scale it now requires to be effective, if the destruction or exhaustion of another country, or intra/transnational group of people, can be considered effective. With the explosion of world population and corresponding migration, there are now too many enemies, whether individual or institutional. PW against them can no longer be neatly confined to national boundaries or the traditional taking of token-cities. And PW has become ruinously expensive, especially for the United States as the world’s de facto policeman and preeminent warfare state. Indeed it is arguable that war and world-policing have become the raison d’être of the United States. The Department of Defense (DOD), which absorbs approximately one-quarter of the entire U.S. Government budget, has long since abandoned its titular mission of defending the territorial United States, so much so that an entirely new Government Department - Homeland Security - has been created for that purpose. 4 Rather it is DOD’s function to project U.S. military power into the territories and affairs of other countries. The stated justifications are many: “democracy”, “weapons of mass destruction”, “nuclear nonproliferation”, “regional stability”, “anti-terrorism” (replacing “anti-communism”), and/or the catchall “U.S. national security”. 3 Like Harry Lime, Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) regarded war as an energizing, revitalizing political influence, deterring the otherwise sluggish descent towards the “last man”. But he did not love war for its destructiveness: “And perhaps a great day will come when a people, distinguished through war and victories, voluntarily proclaims: ‘We break the sword.’ Disarming oneself, from an intensity of feeling, while one is the best armed: That is the means to real peace.” ( The Wanderer and his Shadow , 1880). 4 http://www.usfederalbudget.us/defense_budget_2012_3.html - 18 -"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Not only has the United States assumed the role of world policeman, but the planet’s other countries generally take this role for granted. Every new crisis, especially of a violent nature, generates an appeal for U.S. intervention, or at least expectation of it. Assuming that mankind’s lust for war cannot be eliminated - the League of Nations and its United Nations successor stand as utopian monuments to failure in this naïve desire - what can realistically be done about it? The answer is that while war will remain inevitable and inexorable, it is both possible and practical to revise the way it is conducted. As the world’s policeman and supreme warfare state, the United States has a unique prerogative to determine and change the context and structure of present and future war. It is to this problem - and opportunity - that this book speaks. The new type of war proposed here allows subnational groups, nation-states, and multinational alliances to continue contesting with one another. It allows for modest or far-reaching goals. It even retains traditional glamor, emotional fervor, and heroes. The romance of war continues undimmed into the future. But there are fundamental changes as well. Most immediately and importantly, human beings are not injured or killed, nor are their lands and properties destroyed. Additionally the costs of producing, maintaining, projecting, and implementing the many modern engines of PW destruction are reduced to a small fraction of their current level. How are these seemingly-incompatible goals achievable? Through a basic reconceptualization of United States war methodology - which, as implemented, will gradually become the model for other war- participants as well. This new type of war is called MindWar (MW). In this book MW is defined and explained. Its goals and tools to achieve those goals are detailed. A practical path to its replacement of PW is outlined. Finally a future planetary environment in which mankind’s war-impulse is satisfied by MW is forecast. What this book cannot do, of course, is to compel the decision for either the United States or any other war- habitué to commence the change from PW to MW. And indeed there are powerful interests which would resist such a change, for reasons ranging from war-industrial profiteering to elementary, emotional hatreds of others. Nevertheless, as noted above, the costs for indulging in these PW relics have simply become too great for any nation, and the world collectively, to bear. All that is needed is a practical way out, and MW is that exit and solution. - 19 -"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"To whom is this book addressed? It would be nice if all statesmen, politicians, religious- and ideological movement-leaders would read and implement it immediately; but that won’t happen. Instead MW needs to be experimentally introduced at a “laboratory” level, both so it can become an example to onlookers, and so that its principles can be refined in practice. Indeed MW is both an art and a science, and neither dimension can be neglected if it is to be successful. The laboratory proposed in this book is the United States Army, and particularly its “Special Operations Forces (SOF)” component. The reason for this choice will be discussed in the text, as will be its potentialities and limitations. MindWar went through many drafts prior to publication, and I am deeply grateful to the revered sages who inspired and critiqued its development. Some of these are recognized in the Dedications; others have preferred to remain anonymous. Common to all of them, in my perception and admiration, is the shared conviction that humanity deserves a future and a fate better than self-extermination. 5 A special appreciation is acknowledged to Dr. Gregory S. Seese, who throughout this project not only critiqued the manuscript but, as an Active senior officer at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, ensured that my impression of its present posture and doctrine was accurate. Dr. Seese, who is branch-qualified not only in Psychological Operations and Civil Affairs but also as a Medical Service Corps officer, personally experienced the reality of PW in Afghanistan and wears the Purple Heart as a permanent reminder of his brush with death. Additionally I am very grateful to Dr. William Anderson, a distinguished professional in the rare and exclusive field of Neuropsychiatry, for his reflective and incisive Afterword. That MindWar stands up to his critical eye is all the more vital given the concept’s involvement with not only the psychological but the physical functioning of the human mind. 5 In this they stand most dramatically opposed to the infamous Marquis de Sade, who disdained the notion of redemptive philosophy, holding the supreme compulsion of the human race to be its self-destruction; the extinction of the species is therefore not to be regretted, and history is not progress but contemptibly-helpless drifting towards eventual, inescapable annihilation.

Donald Thomas, The Marquis de Sade (Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1976). - 20 -"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MindWar would never have completed its mysterious and intricate journey from vision to hypothesis to theory to book without regular sprinklings of greenish-grey pixie-dust by my soul-mate and muse Lilith.

Antecedent: MindWar 1980 In the later 1970s, Psychological Operations (PSYOP) doctrine in the U.S. Army had yet to emerge from the disappointment and frustration of the Vietnam War. Thus it was that in 1980 Colonel Paul Vallely 6 , Commander of the 7th PSYOP Group, asked Major Michael Aquino, as his Headquarters PSYOP Research & Analysis (FA) Team Leader, to draft a paper that would encourage some futurethought within the PSYOP community. He did not want a Vietnam postmortem, but rather some fresh and innovative ideas concerning PSYOP’s evolution and application. I prepared an initial draft, which Vallely reviewed and annotated, which proceeded to revised drafts and critiques until he was satisfied, and the result of that was the concept paper: From PSYOP to MW: The 6 Later Major General, USA. - 25 -"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Psychology of Victory . 7 Vallely sent copies of it to various governmental offices, agencies, commands, and publications involved or interested in PSYOP. He intended it not as an article for publication, but simply as a “talking paper” to stimulate dialogue. In this it was quite successful, judging by the extensive and lively letters he received concerning it over the next several months. Within the U.S. military, PSYOP has habitually been relegated to a back-seat as a “force multiplier”. The principal strategic decisions are made in consideration of traditional political and military interests and goals. Only then is PSYOP invited to the table, to help achieve already- agreed-upon missions more efficiently. Vallely’s and my original concept of MW reverses this sequence. Psychological means for achieving victory - essentially through convincing the enemy that he really wants to bring his policies and goals into harmony with ours - are first fashioned in support of basic political realities. The use of “ordinary” military force (bombs, bullets, etc.) is regarded as a “last resort” in circumstances wherein MW by itself fails. The immediate advantage of that 1980 concept of MW is that it conducts wars in nonlethal, noninjurious, and nondestructive ways. Essentially you overwhelm your enemy with argument. You seize control of all of the means by which his government and populace process information to make up their minds, and you adjust it so that those minds are made up as you desire. Everyone is happy, no one gets hurt or killed, and nothing is destroyed. Ordinary warfare, on the other hand, is characterized by its rejection of reason. The antagonists just maim or kill each other’s people, and steal or destroy each other’s land, until one side is hurt so badly that it gives up [or both sides are hurt so badly that they agree to stop short of victory]. After such a war there is lasting misery, hate, and suffering. 7 The term “MW” was coined by another PSYOP officer, Major Richard Sutter, and myself in 1977. After seeing the recent film Star Wars , we imagined a play on its name as a futuristic replacement for the bland Army term “Psychological Operations”. An avowedly science-fictional treatment of MW, complete with a caricature of Sutter at its helm, appears in my Star Wars story The Dark Side , 1977. - 26 -"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The only losers in MW are the war profiteers: companies and corporations which grow fat on orders for helicopters, tanks, guns, munitions, etc. Consequently what President Dwight Eisenhower referred to as the “military/industrial complex” can be counted upon to resist implementation of MW as the governing strategic conflict doctrine. That’s the 1980 MW prospectus in its most simplified form. While in the subsequent decade there was no reason to anticipate that this paper would have any official effect upon U.S. PSYOP doctrine within or beyond the Army, several of its prescriptions were applied during the first Gulf War, and recently even more conspicuously during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In both instances intense PSYOP was directed against the object of the attack, while a simultaneous “Public Affairs” effort was made to shield U.S. domestic public opinion from the type of independent, critical media coverage that plagued the Vietnam War, by “embedding” journalists with military units to inevitably channel their perspectives and perceptions. The impact of even these minor techniques of MW was remarkable. A psychological climate of inexorable U.S. victory was created and sustained in both the United States and Iraq, which accelerated that outcome on the ground. Somewhat less positively, the failure of MW in this instance to be guided by only the most rigorous principles of truth and ethics has just as inexorably led to a substantial post-invasion evaporation of that euphoric climate. Therein lies the Achilles’ heel of MW. Invoking as it does the most intense emotions and commitments of its audiences, it must deliver the goods as they are judged by the target audiences . If the ethical values of those audiences are not respected - if MW is used only in the service of ulterior motives and objectives - the resulting “disintoxication” can be socially shattering. 8 In addition to requiring an absolute ethical anchor, the advanced MW described in this book necessarily extends significantly beyond the time & space boundaries of the immediate battlefield. [In this it differs markedly from Vallely’s and my initial concept, which was simply to reverse its battlefield subordination to PW combat.] 8 In 1987, consequent to a National War College symposium in which PSYOP was assessed only in terms of expediency, I wrote a research paper for the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Psychological Operations: The Ethical Dimension. Its contentions have been incorporated into this book. - 27 -"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"B. MindWar Defined 1. Definition MindWar is the psychological and psychophysiological conditioning of all participants in a sociopolitical problem, first to cooperatively stabilize it without recourse to violence, then to eliminate its basis by the creation of a moral community to supersede it. Examining the elements of this definition: • The base term is a composite of: •• the principle of mind , which is the collection and correlation of sensory input both actively and passively processed by each self-conscious being in order to draw conclusions, make decision, and take actions accordingly. •• the principle of war , which is the extreme expression of intolerance of a current disagreement between at least two social groups when ordinary attempts to resolve it by discussion and diplomacy fail. • Psychology is the study of mind processes and their resultant expression. • Psychophysiology is the branch of psychology which is concerned with the physiological bases of psychological processes. • Conditioning refers to both liminal and subliminal operations of mind modification to produce a desired state of mind perception, interpretation, and behavior. [This problem-tailored mixture of psychological and psychophysiological conditioning is the province of the MindWar Branch, and is detailed in Chapter 3.] - 28 -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"• A sociopolitical problem is a disagreement between two social and/or political groups of people: nation-states and/or sub- or supra-national cultural, religious, ideological, and/or ethnic groups. War results when the problem is sufficiently persistent and intolerable that it cannot be further endured by the participants. • Stabilization refers to the identification and achievement of the best possible resolution of the problem to temporarily remove the danger of PW: the áristos . [This process of stabilization to the áristos is the province of the MetaForce Branch, and is detailed in Chapter 4.] • Nonrecourse to violence precludes not just PW, but any and all physically harmful measures directed against human beings, whether or not they are problem participants. Such prohibited measures include but are not limited to bodily damage (injury, torture, or murder), imprisonment, exile, and/or destruction of means of livelihood. • Creation of a moral community refers to the process of ParaPolitics , resulting not in a structure of exploitation, intimidation, or desperation, but rather in a polis based upon enlightened morality: kalokagathia . [ParaPolitics and kalokagathia are the province of the ParaPolitics Branch, and are detailed in Chapter 5.] 2. What It Is MW controls human external-action thoughts by identifying and adjusting the sensory impressions that the mind uses to assemble, modify, and reinforce them. Humans’ sensory-based thoughts form the basis for their constructed outward personalities, and in groups their mores, biases, beliefs, traditions, habits, and taboos. Thus through a graduated process, MW controls groups of humans. As the size of the group increases, common features of impressions, attitudes, and expressions emerge and can be identified and analyzed statistically, making possible social forecasting and the control of that future by aggregate, not individual manipulation. This is the basis of Isaac Asimov’s science-fictional “psychohistory”, and of less-ambitious - 29 -"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"but demonstrably practical Political Science forecasting. 9 Such techniques and procedures can be applied regardless of how such groups are styled or named: cultures, tribes, societies, nations. Humans usually believe that their individual and collective perceptions and opinions are independently, voluntarily developed. This sense of thought-independence is the basis for the general ideal of the desirability of democracy over other group decision-making systems. A consensus of a majority of independent minds, supposedly, will result in the best and fairest policies for the entire group. Such a rose-tinted image of democracy is of course an illusion. Both governments and private-sector interests devote intense, constant efforts to shaping public perceptions of reality. From peanut butter to PW, these perceptions are guided subtly, pressed directly, and reinforced socially. By the time the masses are permitted to vote, the parameters of their vote have already been predetermined, with only tokenistic variations in the outcome possible. Like his PSYOP predecessor, the MWarrior sees behind this curtain of illusion, because professionally he is a weaver of such curtains. This perspective, this clarity of sight, also confronts him with the aforementioned ethical responsibility to exercise his craft according to only the highest and most rigorous values of human individuality and dignity. At any threshold below this, MW would raise the spectre of George Orwell’s 1984 Thought Police. What distinguishes MW from ordinary political/social/cultural perception- and behavior-influencing efforts is its focus, duration, and intensity. Like PW, MW is a situation-specific operation to deal with a problem of immediate urgency. 10 During this crisis MW overwhelms any existing mundane behavior-dictating systems, replacing them with a more sophisticated, comprehensive, and effective package. 9 Cf. Albert Somit, Political Science and the Study of the Future (Hinsdale, Illinois: The Dryden Press, 1974). 10 This is not to imply that MW enters a new situation without prior knowledge of the area and participants in question. Ongoing country/area orientation remains a general responsibility of MWB assets, but a higher level of concentration and asset activation commences once a MW campaign is initiated. - 30 -"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"A MW campaign commences when the original destabilizing, pre- PW situation is refashioned into a clearly defined and articulated problem (MW Phase 1). The participants are transformed from mutual enemies into allies against that problem as the “common enemy”. Phase 1 culminates with a progressively more refined diagnosis of the problem, resulting in formulation of the áristos to stabilize it. The process of conditioning and transforming the participants is initiated remotely by MindWar Branch (MWB), and is continued through Phase 4. In MW Phase 2 the áristos is reverse-engineered from accomplishment to the present, to establish the most effective, efficient, and economical path to its realization. The necessary organizations, assets, and bases are devised and assembled. MW Phase 3 consists of the achievement of the áristos under the guidance of MetaForce Branch (MFB) teams, followed by initiation of the permanently corrective moral polis by ParaPolitics Branch (PPB) teams. Phase 4 formalizes MW victory in the completion of the polis and departure of PPB. MWB terminates conditioning. The MW campaign structure is then completely dismantled. 3. What It Isn’t a. MW is not “mind control”. The urban-myth image of “government mind-control” is of an insidious, malicious, individuality- destroying technological conspiracy: a sort of “collective lobotomy” to turn the helpless masses into stupefied slaves. [Actually a good case could be made that this is what PW attempts to do, which is why it can get people to slaughter one another en masse for no reason.] The conditioning of MWB has one and only one purpose : to change existing, animalistic prejudices and antagonisms into intelligent, amicable cooperation. MWB does not dictate nor even suggest where this cooperation should lead. Once all problem-participants are working together, they will go through the steps to identify and establish the áristos . b. MW is not a political ideology. Old, crude agendæ of “regime change”, “democratization”, or “anti-[current-bugbearism]” are not part of the MW process. What is important is the achievement of the áristos , then a conscientious interest in kalokagathia , no matter under what symbolic banner. Some social cultures are accustomed to hierarchical - 31 -"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"authority since tribal antiquity; others are more comfortable with egalitarianism and diversified political power. MW’s interest is simply to remove violence from the equation. c. MW is not a religion. Human religions are a consequence of the mystery of the individual soul, which MW PSYCONs cannot reach [and would have no purpose in reaching if they could]. As discussed in Chapter 3.E.2.b, the soul is a manifestation of conceptual consciousness, above and beyond both psychology and psychophysiology. The “morality” of kalokagathia is not that of any sectarian religious code or practice, but that of enlightened humanitarianism embracing any natural or supernatural theology. d. MW is not zombification. Besides not controlling minds, MW does not destroy them either. Sensationalist media exposés of “government-sponsored brain experimentation”, whether true or fanciful, have no connection whatever with MW, which is completely and without exception non-physically or -medically invasive. Indeed the entire MW campaign process requires that all participants be able and willing to function at their highest level and focus of intelligence, and after Phase 4 the future of the moral polis depends upon their self-determined, independent resolve to perpetuate this. 11 11 For details of zombification see Wade E. Davis , The Serpent and the Rainbow (New York: Warner Books, 1987), concerning Haitian Voodoo and actual zombie creation - not by supernatural means, but by the secret use of poisons. The book is based upon field research by the author, who holds undergraduate degrees from Harvard University in Ethnobotany and Biology, and a Ph.D. in Ethnobotany. Specifically MW-relevant cf. Daniel W. Drezner, Theories of International Politics and Zombies (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011). Professor Drezner teaches International Politics at Tufts University. There is no truth whatever to the rumor that the National Security Agency is completely staffed by zombies, though misapprehensions in this regard based upon rare survived encounters are perhaps understandable. - 32 -"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"4. The Three Laws of MindWar Governing all of MW are its three laws: 1. MW is the conduct of war without injury or death to human beings, and without the disruption or destruction of their means of livelihood. 2. While MW includes access to the human mind, this is done only to stimulate its capacity for and interest in cooperative problem-solving. 3. PW is the consequence of MW failure. Therefore MW must not be allowed to fail. C. Physical War Is murder a right reserved for that hated nation? - Captain Nemo, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea In view of the fact that the world is more-or-less constantly at war in multiple locales, and that the term is used frequently in any number of descriptive, argumentative, and emotional contexts, it’s surprising how vague its meaning and how few people could define it if asked. Merriam-Webster’s defines “war” (from the 12th-century Anglo/ French werre ) principally as “a state of usually open and declared armed or hostile conflict between states or nations”. Because war is reserved to sovereign states, many acts such as property and territorial theft, demolition, arson, kidnapping, assault, bodily injury, and of course murder, which would be serious crimes if committed by any individual, become legitimized, even praiseworthy. Decorations for “valor” are usually conferred for the mass killing of “the enemy”, albeit at risk to oneself. The accidental or incidental killing of innocent bystanders is not manslaughter but merely “collateral damage”. In the era of strategic bombing, the extermination of entire cities is considered to be legitimate [and “valorous”]. All that is needed to turn these acts from crimes into heroics is for the parent nation to be “at war”. - 33 -"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Unsurprisingly no one involved in such acts likes to contemplate this nonsensical distinction. If statesmen and soldiers were forced to apply the same standards and responsibilities to war as to individuals, war would be impossible. Over the centuries an enormous collection of non-binding idealisms has come into being under the heading of “international law”, more recently formalized under various treaties (such as the Geneva Conventions) and multinational organizations (such as the United Nations Charter). These sound civilized and humanitarian, but are enforceable and enforced only to the extent that each warring nation chooses to apply them, which is usually at its convenience. Vanquished nations - as Germany and Japan in World War II - generally find that accountability for “war crimes” is reserved for them, not the victors. The point of this rather harsh spotlight on the reality of PW is to establish just how cruel and terrible it is, all the more so in the present era of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weaponry, immensely powerful bombs and other mass-killing devices, and remote/ imprecise/impersonal delivery systems. Technologically advanced nations have become adroit at insulating themselves and their citizenry from such distasteful horrors, but they are there - most especially for the unfortunate victims - nevertheless. As the dictionary reminds us, wars used to be formally declared. This too has become a discarded anachronism since the end of World War II. Partly this has resulted from formal gestures to “outlaw war”, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 and Article 2.4 of the United Nations Charter (to both of which the United States is a signatory). PWs, of course, have gone right on - now just relabeled “police actions”, “international assistance”, or otherwise under the numerous loopholes in the Pact and Charter. “Only the dead,” observed George Santayana, “have seen the end of war.” Moreover when one or more nations resort to PW, neither the rationale for starting it nor the requirements for ending it are anything more than vague exhortations, more to rally domestic support than to communicate principles or standards to the enemy. Naturally the common people don’t want war. Neither in Russia nor in England nor for that matter in Germany. But after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of - 34 -"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country. - Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, at the Nürnberg Trials, 1946 Like old soldiers, wars don’t end - they just fade away as the combatants tire of the expense, destruction, and human misery, or finally stumble away from them, forgetting what they were supposed to be about in the first place. Journalists and historians rush into justify or condemn them, define their place in history; and as often as not within a few years once-bitter enemies find themselves bedfellows in new, re- enemied alliances. If there is one common thread to all wars, it is that in the long run of human history, they change very little in the course of civilization. They just rough it up along the way. What is particularly important here is that this haphazard nature of modern PW effectively prevents it from a rationally-planned termination. In other words, if you don’t know where it’s going or when it’s going to get there, you can’t reverse-engineer its outcome to the beginning or middle of it. You cannot develop a strategy, a master-plan to make it end quicker, less lethally, or even solving the problem(s) which supposedly made it necessary to begin with. Nor have history’s PWs broken out at necessary, inevitable junctures in antagonists’ discourse. They start by impulse or accident, by a grandstanding cannonading of Fort Sumter or a pistol-shot at a visiting Austrian archduke. Sometimes they start for no reason at all, as in the Tonkin Gulf nonincident or Adolf Hitler’s memorable speech to the Reichstag that German soldiers “had advanced into Poland and were now defending themselves”. The antagonists could have continued trying to resolve their differences civilly and reasonably. They just didn’t want to anymore. Men love war because it allows them to look serious. Because they imagine that it is the one thing that stops women laughing at them. In it they can reduce women to the status of objects. That is the great distinction between the sexes. Men see objects; women see the relationship between objects. Whether the objects need each other, love each other, match each other. It is an extra dimension of feeling we men are without, and one that makes war abhorrent to all real women - and absurd. I will tell you what war is. War is a psychosis caused by an inability to see rela tionships. Our relationship with our fellowmen. Our relationship with our - 35 -"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"economic and historical situation. And above all our relationship to nothingness. To death. - Maurice Conchis 12 War is also expensive. It consumes not only human lives [and their potential commercial productivity], but also the materiel necessary to conduct it: weapons, transportation systems, and the entire logistical “tail” these require. Medical costs increase both during combat and long after it has ceased. According to Brown University’s online “Costs of War Project”, as of February 2013 the combined Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan PWs have cost the United States $4 trillion, a figure so large that it is conceptually abstract. 13 [A trillion is a million million.] By way of comparison, as of March 2012 the entire United States public national debt was $10.7 trillion. 14 So in addition to the alternative/ constructive purposes for which this PW money could have been spent, its substantial financing costs will continue indefinitely into our future. “War is not healthy for children and other living things”, including those who fight it: What was once called “battle fatigue” and more recently “post-traumatic stress syndrome” has increased in severity to a point where in 2013 the U.S. Army is experiencing almost a soldier- suicide a day. 15 If modern PW is so destructive, wasteful, and costly, one would think it would be avoided if at all possible. Yet underlying it is not only its appeal to emotional lust [for a simple, satisfying solution to annoyingly-complex problems] but an almost eerie tradition that wars are the definition of nations and their historical legacies. 16 What we must conclude of war, therefore, is that, though irrational and nonsensical, it is nevertheless both emotionally desirable and socially inevitable. It cannot be stopped. It can, however, be transformed. 12 Fowles, John, The Magus (Boston: Little, Brown & Company, 1965). 13 http://costsofwar.org/ 14 http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2012/opds022012.pdf 15 http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=169340558 16 Are wars anything but the means whereby a nation is nourished, whereby it is strengthened, whereby it is buttressed? - The Marquis de Sade - 36 -"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"D. MindWar Transformation MW is not a solution for every conflict that may arise. Nor, if it is implemented, will it necessarily be either a complete or a permanent solution. What it is is a preferred alternative to PW, an áristos , which should be tried first. If it is successful, so much the better for everyone concerned. If it fails, the participants retain the option to fall back on PW. Indeed, as discussed above, it is the undesirable alternative of PW that gives MW its principal “weapon”. It is in everyone’s interest that it not fail. It is the goal of MW to, while fulfilling man’s need for war, rechannel its expression into positive, orderly, and nondestructive procedures. To see how this is possible, we will take a closer look at its four [minus 1] phases: 1. Phase Ø: Cessation of Proxy or Covert PhysWar 17 In an era when the conduct of undeclared war, often through intelligence agency paramilitary forces, mercenaries, proxy nations, and “military advice/aid”, has become the norm, all such devices for PW actions must be discontinued. If they are allowed during the prewar/ diplomacy period of relations between the parties, they will: a. Exacerbate immediate and lasting emotional hatred between the parties. b. Because of their covert, devious, unacknowledged nature, destroy any atmosphere of trust between the parties. c. Generate death, injury, and damage to both parties which will proportionately increase the difficulty of reaching a mutually-acceptable solution for both. d. Cause onlooking third nations/groups/individuals to view any subsequent MW actions with cynicism, as being mere superficial formality in a conflict which has already escalated past that point of resolution. 17 For a detailed discussion of Phase 0, see Chapter 6. - 37 -"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"2. Phase 1: The Redefinition of an Assigned Conflict in Terms of an Acceptable and Practical Outcome. 18 PW is characterized by a progressively-deteriorating diplomatic situation in which one or more parties eventually lose patience, are overcome by fear or anger, or are emotionally moved by dramatic incident from reason into violence. In the case of the United States, this country has a strong tradition of civilian control of foreign policy and the diplomatic process generally. DOD is not invited into a situation until the gauntlet has been thrown down, whereupon it is expected not to retrieve it but to simply commence PW. No goal, no measure of victory [in these euphemistic days “exit strategy”] accompanies such an order to march. Vaguely it is assumed that such niceties will come later, after - in the traditionally- meaningless jargon, “the situation has been developed”. PW being a progressive and random application of blunt-instrument destruction by all combatants, however, such actual goals and requirements for its cessation never do appear. The vagaries simply continue until pressures unrelated to the actual PW contest bring it to a clumsy, unproductive fade-out. a. Declaration of MindWar The first reform of MW, therefore, is one of demarcation . It begins with a formal declaration of MW and ends with an equally formal declaration of peace. Before these are brushed aside as archaic ceremonies, consider the reasons for them. The purposes of a declaration of MW are: (1) to require the Congress to meet its responsibility under the Constitution Article I.8.11 to decide when the United States takes any international or supranational conflict from diplomacy to war. Such a decision, which directly affects countless lives on all sides, is simply too consequential to be abandoned to the current President - who, of course, is himself not an independent decision- maker in such matters even if personally well-intentioned. 18 For a detailed discussion of Phase 1, see Chapter 7. - 38 -"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The rationale for Article I.8.11 was not just to ensure that the United States would not be rashly dragged or tricked into war. It was also to ensure that, if a war were declared by the elected representatives of the national citizenry, a proportionate number of that citizenry would understand and agree with the vote. In short, when the United States declares war, the entire country should be behind it. It should never be a fiat by a clique which the people neither understand nor endorse. That is the formula to lose a war from the moment it is begun, as we have experienced all too often in our post-World War II series of fiat wars. (2) to state clearly the circumstances which have caused further diplomacy to be rejected in favor of war. This is an explanation for three audiences: the citizenry of the United States, the opponent country or group, and the onlooking rest of the world. Each must be convinced that the stated reasons are both complete and sincere. Otherwise: (a) the U.S. citizenry will suspect that it has been deceived, and will not support the war. (b) the opponent will not accurately understand why it is being attacked, which prevents it from knowledgeably trying to address those reasons if it wishes to do so, and also immediately antagonizes it with the suspicion that the attack is for ulterior, more venial reasons. (c) the rest of the world will not see the justice of the U.S. attack, and may assume that it is mere predatory aggression. This is not just a public-relations consideration, as third parties are often drawn into ongoing wars as they spread and escalate. The sooner and more definitively that the United States can establish its just cause, the less chance it will be surprised by overt or covert additional enemies later on. - 39 -"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"(3) to state equally clearly the goal of the war, e.g. the conditions for its conclusion. Without such a statement, neither side knows where it’s going or what it’s doing. The war becomes a stumble- around in a darkened room, with plenty of tripping over furniture and running into walls, and no open doors with illuminated exit-signs. If, on the other hand, the United States makes it clear what it requires to stop the war, this country can direct its efforts, including popular support, towards achieving that goal. The enemy country also knows what the United States wants of it, and can immediately or subsequently decide whether to comply. Onlooking third parties can more clearly estimate whether the war might or should involve them, or whether they can effectively steer clear of it. b. Diagnosis of the “Disease” PW treats the symptoms of the disease only; MW treats the causes of the disease. As part of the Declaration process, the root problem or problems of the destabilizing situation must be clearly and objectively identified in terms of both policies/systems and those individuals or groups controlling them. In many ways this will be the most difficult and exacting requirement of the MW process, because it calls for cold, unrationalizing honesty in all directions. There must be no off-the-table “sacred cows”: no traditional or habitual assumptions favoring either party’s desires that can pre-skew and potentially derail a MW solution. Among such “sacred cows” [for both parties]: (1) The acquisition or possession of nuclear or any other advanced form of weaponry. (2) Creation or preservation of economic advantage, either for a centralized economy or national industrial/trade interests. 19 19 There are powerful emotional and economic interest groups in favor of PW, who can be counted upon to resist its replacement by MW generally. - 40 -"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"(3) Type of government, whether autocratic, oligarchic, democratic, theocratic, or any variation on these. (4) Internal national policies, customs, or issues bearing indirectly upon the conflict. (5) The demands or desires of uninvolved third parties, whether other nations seeking to profit from the situation, supranational religious institutions, or international bodies such as the United Nations or NATO. c. Prescription of the “Cure”: The Áristos The moment there is a formal Declaration of MindWar, all “sacred cows” become secondary to the primary task, which is MW victory. If and when that is accomplished and the Defense Department returns the situation to civilian institutions, the “pasture” is once again their concern. Irrelevant and unessential considerations (“sacred cows”) discarded, the key elements causing the situation are identified. These will be unique to each situation, of course, so cannot be forced into standardized definitions or habitual responses to them. In the case of a territorial dispute, for instance, the disputing parties must be identified. It may be international, or intertribal, or religious factional, political ideological, or a mixture of more than one of these. In each situation we know only that the United States is one of the parties. The situation is then analyzed in terms of: (1) Its desired solution for each party. (2) The most beneficial solution for each party (which may not be identical to the desired one). (3) The minimum effective solution for each party. (4) The minimum tolerable solution for each party (which may not be identical to the minimum effective one). These solutions are next plotted in a matrix within an overall time- and cost-boundary, and the intersections examined for matches. Ideally - 41 -"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"a match will appear to fit (1) or (2) intersections, but probably not. So the MWarrior examines all (3) and (4) intersections, looking for the simplest, quickest, most economical, and least PW-triggering intersection. This becomes the MW victory objective, which the United States then openly announces to all parties. All participants are now aware of the U.S. Declaration of MW, the reasons for it, and the áristos for its conclusion. We now enter the difficult area of “civilian control of the military”. It is an old complaint of the U.S. Military that its civilian superiors meddle in its conduct of an assigned war, screwing it up. Civilians respond with the mantra that “war is too important to be left to generals” and that [as indeed in PW] the blind application of brute force solves nothing. 20 MW must therefore at this point start the continuous process of presenting its case to its civilian superiors. 3. Phase 2: The reverse-engineering of the decided outcome from its establishment back to the present situation. 21 The purpose of this is simply to identify all of the component changes that will be necessary to accomplish the desired transformation. If one or more components are found to be impossible, then the overall goal needs to be reconceptualized or reduced until it is practically achievable. Here sociopolitical and economic forecasting techniques are essential. Present policy options must be extended and extrapolated. The aggregate of these must be analyzed into a cross-matrix to ascertain whether there are any incompatibilities. Any developing component- change must be reentered into the matrix to ensure that the totality remains viable. From each completed matrix a MW map emerges: “how to get there from here”. As with Phase 1, this map must be understandable by and acceptable to United States decision-makers at all levels. A MW matrix must stand on all of its feet to be effective, and if any one of them is undermined, the matrix collapses. 20 Everybody wants ta get inta de act. - Jimmy Durante 21 For a detailed discussion of Phase 2, see Chapter 8. - 42 -"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Thus the consensus arrived at in Phase 1 must survive Phase 2, which means that the general and ideal must survive its translation into the specific and practical. 4. Phase 3: MW Attack. 22 The matrix is set in motion. Its components are assigned to appropriate implementation units, and those units delegate them further down to implementation action elements. A simultaneous, continuous feedback system is instituted so that every action, inaction, success, and failure is fed back into the overall MW matrix. If a failure is examined and found to be correctible, the action is retried until successful. If it is evaluated as uncorrectable, and cannot be compensated for at higher-intermediate levels, the MW matrix is again adjusted to reduce the overall goal accordingly. This process of feedback and matrix goal-reduction is not to be understood as an “easy-out”. MW is just that: a war. It is a deliberate effort to change the enemy. This is rarely a simple or easy task. MW requires outthinking the enemy at all times and stages of the conflict, and this is a constant, demanding process. The MW matrix is no good if it is reduced to zero, or to a fiction of actual accomplishment. It must be pressed forward, forced into existence by the full will and skill of the United States. Only where it is discovered to be intrinsically flawed should it be modified. 5. Phase 4: MindWar Victory 23 Once the MW matrix is achieved, formal victory is declared and the war is immediately and absolutely ended. This is a signal to the vanquished enemy that it is no longer under attack, and to the United States government and citizenry that no more assets are to be so devoted. The formal, unilateral declaration of peace is just as important to the concept of MW as the earlier declaration of war. Current PW eliminates both, with the result that not only is the Constitution ignored but the nation and the world not given a clear and unequivocal signal of both: 22 For a detailed discussion of Phase 3, see Chapter 9. 23 For a detailed discussion of Phase 4, see Chapter 10. - 43 -"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"- With the declaration of war, all responsibility is turned over to the Defense Department. Exterior activity, such as by the Intelligence community, ceases.

International relations are returned to normal diplomatic and commercial venues. The Intelligence community can now be reengaged if appropriate. [Cf. Chapter 3 concerning the role of intelligence in MW.] That’s it. Upon a first reading, one may be taken aback by the apparent simplicity of this Phase-structure. This is not only intentional but indeed essential. Recourse to the current U.S. Army MISO 24 manuals quickly induces MEGO 25 ; over the years PSYOP has become the darling of innumerable staff studies, think tanks, and cartons of eggheads. The result is something that no one can actually use. The concept and component phases of MW must be simple, easy-to- use, flexible, and intuitive. Its focus can be broadened and extended at progressively-higher echelons, but the techniques themselves must be as simple to use as a Boy Scout pocketknife. Only thus will MW be able to react instantly to changing conditions, and to remain two steps ahead of the enemy. In Part II each of the MW branches and their functions are examined in detail. Then in Part III the five Phases of a MW campaign are discussed, to include the mixture of branch expertise necessary for their success. 24 “Military Information Support Operations”: since 2010, the humorously transparent effort to disguise PSYOP with a soothing euphemism. 25 MEGO: My Eyes Glaze Over [from reading material that is too long, too complex, and too incomprehensible]. - 44 -"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Part II: Army War Branches - 45 -"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"- 46 -"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" Chapter 2: The PhysWar Branches What is the spirit of the bayonet?

The PhysWar Mission of the Army The Army’s mission is to fight and win our Nation’s wars by providing prompt, sustained land dominance across the full range of military operations and spectrum of conflict in support of combatant commanders. We do this by: • Executing Title 10 and Title 32 United States Code directives, to include organizing, equipping, and training forces for the conduct of prompt and sustained combat operations on land. • Accomplishing missions assigned by the President, Secretary of Defense and combatant commanders, and Transforming for the future. 26 So states the U.S. Army’s official website. What this means in practice is that the Army is designed and organized for PW through its backbone Combat Arms branches: Infantry, Armor/Cavalry, and Field/ Air Defense Artillery. Often grouped with these are Aviation, the [combat] Corps of Engineers and the Signal Corps; and behind these are numerous “combat support” and “combat service support” branches. In principle and practice, they all exist to maximize the Army’s PW combat power, which is to kill, capture, and/or destroy whatever is defined as “the enemy” by higher authority (in practice the President and in theory the Congress of the United States). 26 http://www.army.mil/info/organization/ - 47 -"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The other armed services - the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps - have similar general mission statements reflecting their operational environments. But it is the Army which focuses predominantly upon land operations, and land is where people live and their means of livelihood are established. As the Army is configured and employed, so necessarily must follow the other services. B. “Special Operations” Branches in the PhysWar Army In addition to the traditional/established combat branches of the Army, there presently exist three “Special Operations” branches which, until the implementation of MW, function simply to augment, support, and clean up after PW campaigns. 27 Thus they are in effect, if not in self- image, “battlefield janitors”. The oldest of these, Civil Affairs Branch, was formally established in 1955 as the Civil Affairs & Military Government Branch, USAR, following a long history of less-formal, events-driven offices and organizations within the Army to deal with post-PW civilian crises. In 1961 it was expanded into an Active Army branch as well, though it remains accessible by post-commissioning [officer] transfer only. The other two branches - Special Forces and Psychological Operations - came into being as “branch immaterial” specialties following World War II. Thus officers course-qualified for them retained their original branch affiliations, and normally returned to them after temporary assignments to SF/PSYOP units. Special Forces was finally formalized as a branch in 1987, and Psychological Operations 2006. As reviewed in Chapters #3-5, CA, SF, and PSYOP shared not only their “battlefield janitor” status, but a distinctly non-destructive doctrinal orientation. CA was expected to rebuild destroyed population infrastructures; SF was to teach and train local military & paramilitary individuals & groups; and PSYOP was to attempt to control both civil & military audiences through propaganda. 27 This book considers the recently-created Electronic Warfare Branch as a combat support branch similar to the Signal Corps, rather than a component of Special Operations. - 48 -"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In the new MW environment, the relationship of these three branches to the PW branches of the Army is conceptually reversed. The “Special Operations” branches - now evolved into new designs, functions, and names - become the Army’s initial and principal means of fulfilling its mission. The PW branches and their support systems become a less-desirable alternative to be employed only if MW fails. Indeed it is their very undesirability - the prospect of the death, injury, and destruction they inflict - that encourages all the more interest in a MW solution by all involved groups and individuals. C. The MindWar Mission of the Army Since its creation on 14 June 1775, the U.S. Army has been an institution and an engine of death and destruction, albeit and avowedly to preserve and protect the United States and its citizenry. MindWar proposes to change the Army’s operational methodology to a completely constructive and creative one, with its PW power maintained and brandished as the same sort of unthinkable deterrent as the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Thus other nation-states and nonstate groups will have no alternative but to choose the MW option, which, once they do, they will discover works entirely to their rescue and regeneration.

Psychological Warfare The related and more traditional term “Psychological Warfare” had been retired to the Orwellian memory hole by 2007, but previously: Psychological warfare (PSYWAR) is the planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the achievement of national objectives. 32 Note that in these definitions per se there is no mention of “the truth” or of the United States’ commitment to it. They are simply “mission-oriented” definitions. To be sure, they could be phrased thus to encompass the PSYOP and PSYWAR of all nations, not just the United States.

Propaganda The stock-in-trade of pre-MW PSYOP was propaganda , which is: ... any form of communication in support of national objectives designed to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor, either directly or indirectly. 33 Despite exhaustive efforts to “respectabilize” it, propaganda as a concept still labors under the negative image Joseph Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry created during the Third Reich. Goebbels’ passion for the utility of propaganda led him to an arrogant contempt for uncontrolled, purposeless information. In his eyes the motivational and indoctrinational goals of the German propaganda effort fully justified the complete selection and packaging of information as might be convenient or expedient: Success is the important thing. Propaganda is not a matter for average minds, but rather a matter for practitioners. It is not supposed to be lovely or theoretically correct. I do not care if I give wonderful, aesthetically elegant speeches, or speak so that women cry. The point of a political speech is to persuade people of what we think right. I speak differently in the provinces than I do in Berlin, and when I speak in Bayreuth, I say different things than I say in the Pharus Hall. That is a matter of practice, not of theory. We do not want to be a movement of a few straw brains, but rather a movement that can conquer the broad masses. Propaganda should be popular, not intellectually pleasing. It is not the task of propaganda to discover intellectual truths. It is thus not surprising that today, in most people’s eyes, “propaganda” has simply become a synonym for utilitarian unconcern 33 Ibid.

Once more this definition can be excused as applicable to all propaganda, not just that of the United States; but in that case the door is again left open for the U.S. to utilize propaganda per that same rationale. At least up to 1979 [but, curiously, absent from all subsequent manuals] the Army made the following statement concerning its propaganda: U.S. Army propaganda is based on a strategy of truth. It seeks to strengthen or create a favorable image by emphasizing the credible truth. This is so because the complete truth is frequently not believable by the target audience. Dedication to the truth does not imply that a full recounting of facts is required or advisable. Facts to support certain themes may be selected while others may be excluded. The propagandist reports those facts that present his side in the best light ... 35 What differentiates a “ strategy of truth” from just “ the truth”? Is the truth uttered merely because it is thought to be less vulnerable than lies, or because of a commitment to it that is above and beyond motives of advantage or expedience? And is the selective presentation of facts [and exclusion of others bearing upon the situation] justifiably considered “the truth” - even if done to enhance the “credibility” of a message to an audience? 36 34 “The United States has no propaganda to peddle, since we are neither advocates nor defenders of any dogma so fragile or doctrine so frightened as to require it.” - President Lyndon B. Johnson, at the swearing-in of USIA Director Leonard Marks, September 1965. 35 FM 33-1, op.cit ., page # 11-7. 36 “Credibility and truth do not necessarily march in step in psychological warfare. What is said, written, printed or broadcasted in the field must be credible within the terms in which it is projected; it need not necessarily be the truth in every instance. In fact the truth can in certain circumstances defeat credibility.” - Charles Roetter, Psychological Warfare (London: B.T. Batsford Ltd, 1974). - 54 -"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"In traditional “battlefield janitor” MISO, propaganda frequently takes the form of simple, crude messages directed at low-level PW combatants, coaxing them to retreat, defect, or revolt. The motivations invoked are similarly basic: fear, greed, comfort, personal safety, vengeance. Its effectiveness is directly proportionate to battlefield conditions: victorious soldiers will ignore it, while defeated ones will clutch at it. Either way it is recognized as something inherently insulting and shameful to the recipient - an image which reflects back upon its ostensible source: the United States. Dissemination of crude propaganda also undermines the effectiveness of any higher-echelon actions targeting leadership, simply by springing from the same source. If the United States is perceived to be cynical and contemptuous on one level, it will be seen through this lens on all levels. Propaganda’s effectiveness is inversely proportional to the degree of belief and behavior modification it proposes. To understand this, the propagandist must realize that people do not “change their minds”; rather they reinterpret and reevaluate their existing thought-patterns of reality as they are so motivated. 4. The Shades Confusion over the terms “white”, “grey”, and “black” propaganda is common, so it may be helpful to review their definition as well before proceeding further. Note that all three shades of propaganda are source -determined. The color-coding does not refer to the truthfulness of the propaganda message itself : White propaganda is propaganda in which the source is openly and accurately stated. Grey propaganda is propaganda in which no source is stated. Black propaganda is propaganda in which the source is deliberately and explicitly misrepresented. 37 37 Ibid ., page #11-2.

General Parameters What is evident in the above definitions is that PSYOP as a tool is generally understood to be mission-justified , and further that its potential use includes deliberate falsehood . These features do not in themselves invalidate PSYOP as a U.S. policy option, any more than a rifle’s potential for unethical use invalidates its place as a tool in support of ethical ends. What is important is that, like the rifle, PSYOP can be used unethically just as easily as it can be used ethically. The mere fact that it is the United States who employs it does not in itself validate it from an ethical standpoint. 6. Beyond Propaganda: The Influence Continuum The rationale for propaganda is that if a believable message is delivered to an audience, that audience will modify its behavior accordingly. This is based on two assumptions: that people construct their beliefs and attitudes by reason, and that they can be further inspired to act in furtherance of them by reason. As examined below under “E. Thought Architecture”, this is a fatally-flawed misapprehension. 95% of human thinking is subconscious, and further takes the form of response to accustomed patterns. Only the remaining 5% is conscious, and only part of that is the consequence of reason (e.g. algorithmic). In his current examination of the science of PSYOP, Dr. Gregory Seese rejects the usefulness of propaganda entirely; indeed the “P-word” is not mentioned even once therein. 38 Within the realm of conscious/reasoned thought, Seese identifies a five-stage “influence continuum”, from the least to the most forceful: (1) Information & Education, (2) Persuasion, (3) Compliance, (4) Coercion, and (5) Thought Reform. In PSYOP campaigns the first four of these may be employed both independently and concertedly as the situation demands them, with their effectiveness measured strictly by any consequent change in target audience behavior . 38 Major Gregory S. Seese, Psy.D., The Science of Influence: A Primer for Psychological Operations (v3.3), 2013). - 56 -"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Level 5 (Thought Reform) is the Continuum’s theoretical extreme, but because of the intense psychological pressure involved must not be used by the United States. It is perhaps best exemplified by the “brainwashing” torture notorious during the capitalist/communist Cold War, and thus results more in severe mental damage than in any useful or productive behavioral modification. Level 4 (Coercion) is also MW-prohibited, since it is a somewhat imprecise level extending from “PSYOP of the deed” [as in compel people to safety when they are faced with battlefield danger] to the MW- unacceptable extremes of physical threats or harm to force obedience. Thus mere changing of beliefs or opinions, as attempted for instance in surveys or interrogations, is inadequate. What is material and relevant is action, specifically action commenced and changed in cooperation with the campaign objectives. The crude instrument of propaganda has no place in this continuum; at none of its levels is there distortion, omission, or falsification of information concerning the message. The graduated emphasis is dictated more by available-time and -resource constraints: In a PW battlefield environment, for instance, there is obviously little time for leisurely education and more of an urgency for essentially-succinct instructions. Within the universe of MW, Seese’s continuum pertains to Liminal Involuntary Psycontrol (LIPC). 39 In this area it is the most comprehensive formula for obtaining behavioral results, and in situations of extreme urgency and pressure quite probably the most practical and productive. The subliminal realms (SLIPC) generally require much more time, precision, and intricacy. B. Key Principles of the American Military Culture PSYOP’s place within the Army is a function of the generally- accepted values of that institution, which in turn represent what the Army perceives as its proper posture within the culture of the United States generally. Key principles of the American military culture include: 39 See E.3 below. - 57 -"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"1. Primacy of the Constitution The existence and actions of the military are held to be justified by [and in defense of] the United States Constitution. It is significant that the oath of an American serviceman is to this document, not to a particular individual, office, government, or administration. The effect of this orientation is to place the military at least theoretically within an “ethical universe” that is more or less purely Lockean. John Locke (1632-1704) was responsible for the doctrine that all government should be limited in its powers and exists only by consent of the governed. He introduced the concepts of “inalienable rights” (which cannot be contracted away to the government or anyone else) and that “all men are created equal”. Locke based his political philosophy upon reason, paying lip service to rational ideals. He wanted to build a system that would reflect “basic man” rather than one which sets ideals and expectations for him that he cannot reach. The advantage of this kind of system is that it never overreaches itself and rarely falls victim to hypocrisy of a structural sort, since not much except cooperation and stability is expected of it. The disadvantage is that it is a difficult system to improve by inspired or intellectual leadership, since political power is concentrated in majority opinion - which tends to be sluggish, conservative, complacent, and apathetic - unless a crisis shocks it into action. Political power can be corrupted through the economic, social, or demagogic manipulation of the people. The “self-evident truths” in this perceptual universe are accepted as articles of faith which need no argumentative justification. Indeed to question the assumptions underlying the Constitution would be viewed as a kind of quasi-religious heresy - as indeed it is from a philosophical perspective. The social-contract theorists of the Enlightenment held a vague, general disbelief that God, if he were presumed to exist, would disregard the operation of natural laws to take an interest in the behavior of individual human beings for better or worse. Generally termed Deism , this belief-system included such Founding Fathers as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Paine. They therefore designed ideal governmental systems in which human reason was preeminent, with traditional Judæo/Christian divine influence being relegated to a ceremonial and symbolic role in actual political decision-making. - 58 -"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"2. Individual Ethics Ethics , alternatively called moral philosophy , seeks to distinguish what is good from what is bad and to formulate justifiable reasons for making such distinctions. Philosophy generally refers to the rational examination of an individual’s or group’s core principles. As a branch of philosophy, ethics is a normative science; that is, it seeks to identify principles of good and evil that transcend social, cultural, or political convention (social contract theory). Beyond a merely normative approach to ethics is metaethics , which seeks to investigate normative currency-terms such as “good”, “evil”, “justice”, “ought”, “right”, and “wrong”. The neutrality and objectivity of metaethics presume that such terms are not dependent upon moral beliefs (such as religion). The metaethical concept of naturalism , advanced by theorists such as John Dewey and Herbert Spencer, posits that moral terms have a basis in scientific fact. Intuitionists agree that moral terms have an external, reliable basis but attribute it to self-evident (“I know it when I see it”) qualities. Challenging intuitionists and naturalists are moral skepticists who insist that moral terms are completely arbitrary. Emotivists claim that such terms have no capacity for being true or false in themselves, and that the people who use them are simply stating their emotions about an issue. Subjectivists maintain that moral judgments state subjective facts only about attitudes, not the objects of those attitudes. And Imperativists insist that moral judgments are actually “commands” in another guise, hence do not focus at all on criteria of truth or objectivity. When even its basic language terms are so fraught with controversy, normative ethics is off to a rough start. Beyond this are arguments over the criteria for making any kind of moral judgment. Teleologists maintain that the morality of an action is determined solely by its consequences. Some teleologists, such as Plato, insist that the perfection of the self is the correct consequence; hedonists say that it is mere pleasure; utilitarians counter that it must be the greatest benefit to society. Theologians , such as Aquinas, Luther, et al. , dispense with teleology altogether in favor of obedience to proclaimed or perceived morality from a God or gods. The sharpest attack on ethics generally comes from egoists such as Thomas Hobbes and Friedrich Nietzsche ( cf . his Genealogy of Morals ), who consider all ethics as verbal camouflage to conceal the reality that - 59 -"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"all actions are merely in the interest of the stronger (who by that same strength dictate all definitions of “justice”, “right”, etc.). The egoist position was represented in the Platonic Dialogue The Republic by Glaucon, and went on to form the basis for Enlightenment “social contract” theories (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau), wherein “justice” and related terms became just matters of agreement and contract between the people of a society. Accordingly it is not surprising that practical problem-solvers shy away from metaethical issues and try rather to address questions in terms of what are generally called descriptive ethics - the customs and standards of a given culture which serve as measurements of rightness and wrongness within that culture. An acceptance of descriptive ethics as ethics leads to an attitude of ethical relativism , according to which there is no standard for judging right and wrong apart from the cultural environment of specific situations. Hence the killing of humans by humans may be “ethical” if sanctioned by a judge or national sovereign, but the identical act may be “unethical” if undertaken by an individual, regardless of reasons. Until the Enlightenment of the late-17th and 18th centuries, ethical philosophy was completely metaethical; standards of good and evil were accepted as being prescribed by one or more divinities or divine principles (Egyptian neteru , Platonic Forms). It was humanity’s task not to determine ethics, but rather to understand and obey divinely- ordained ethics. Inherent in the American military culture, at least theoretically, is the responsibility of each individual for his own ethical behavior - and for the issuance of ethical commands to subordinates. Although the oath of military service also stipulates obedience to superior authority, this is theoretically subordinate to one’s personal ethical responsibility and cannot be used to excuse unethical acts. This, of course, was raised to the level of explicit doctrine as a consequence of the post-World War II Nürnberg trials, in which German officials had unsuccessfully argued that their oaths of obedience to Adolf Hitler superseded, hence excused actions on their part which outraged prevailing Western norms. The word “theoretically” appears twice in the above paragraph for a deliberate reason. Although the so-called “Nürnberg principle” is officially accepted by the United States, it is a difficult standard to apply [or enforce] in practice. The reason for this difficulty ought now to be clear: It requires individuals to make decisions according to ethical criteria which they do - 60 -"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"not understand save as vague articles of faith. The best that can be hoped for is a Stoic reliance upon impressions of situations to be reliable ones. Stoicism was a philosophical system holding that it is man's duty to freely conform to natural law and his destiny, that virtue is the highest good, and that the wise man should be free from passion, equally unperturbed by joy or grief. First introduced by Zeno, a somewhat mysterious Phœnician/Egyptian (336-264 BCE), it was later espoused by Chrysippus, Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus, and Emperor Marcus Aurelius of Rome. In the “social contract” atmosphere of the Enlightenment [and American Revolution], judgment of such situational impressions was generally taken to be based upon what the philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) described as “prevailing passionate custom”. According to this standard, reason may be used to discover the “fitting” - the most practical or sensible approach - but not the “morally good”. Hence virtue and vice are products of sentiment. Virtue is not approved because it is virtue; it is considered to be virtue because it meets with passionate approval. Even with such conventionalized guidelines, it is difficult for a soldier, particularly of junior rank and/or limited education, to venture an ethical judgment overruling that of a senior. There is always the excuse that the senior is presumed to be aware of [and have taken into consideration] aspects of the situation of which the junior is ignorant. 3. Worth of the Individual As the individual is placed at the center of the Lockean universe, being in effect a “sacred object”, each individual’s ethics are an essential personal responsibility. In certain other cultures the individual is considered to be a mere component of the state, or of a class, or of an ethnic group. In such cases the right and responsibility to determine and judge ethics is similarly removed. This point is related to that discussed immediately above (the Nürnberg principle), but is separate in that it tasks each individual to be ethical, whether or not commands from a superior are involved. Within the American military - most conspicuously in the officer corps - there is a further expectation that professional ethics be acknowledged and observed. These ethics are couched in terms of one’s responsibility to one’s service, fellow servicemembers, and country. - 61 -"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"They do not address ethics beyond the Lockean universe, and indeed it would probably be worrisome to the nation if they did. The armed forces exist to preserve and protect the United States as it is defined by the Constitution, after all - not to presume to judge that definition. To the extent that American military thinking is thus bounded by Constitutional values, military leaders are uncomfortable venturing outside that ordered environment. Conventional military wisdom is simply to war against and defeat those who think and act in ways that are perceived as an “unacceptable” threat to the United States, with the expectation that they will then see the error of their ways and be converted to “right thinking”. Persistent rogues will be dispatched. The psychology is essentially similar to that of the medieval Crusades, wherein it was thought entirely proper to win converts to Christianity - or Islam - at swordpoint. 4. Civilian Preeminence The United States incorporates the principle of civilian superiority to the armed services. The effect of this from an ethical perspective is to place a certain escape-hatch between military leaders and their responsibility to Constitutional values. While the Nürnberg principle forbids the military to relinquish personal ethical responsibility for their decisions, the civilian government can cite its Constitutional superiority in support of its prerogative to “interpret” said ethics. At the national level it would be unacceptable for a military leader to challenge that presumption [and it must be borne in mind that controversial issues are rarely clear-cut ones where the Constitution is concerned]. As a practical matter the Constitution is what the executive branch of the government says it is, except in those occasional instances where what amounts to a “priesthood” of this surrogate divinity - the Supreme Court - assumes the prerogative to interpret the Constitution, much in the same way that ancient Egyptian priests sought to interpret the will of Amon-Ra or that medieval scholars sought to interpret Christian scripture through canon law. 5.

Ethics is an elusive concept whose very vagueness leaves the individual uncertain as to just what his actual responsibility is, to say nothing of how he should apply it. C. PSYOP: “UnAmerican But Necessary” What does all this have to do with PSYOP? To be effective in his art, the PSYOPerator must venture beyond the Lockean universe, and he cannot allow his assessments of competitive universes to be distorted by Lockean faith-based values. If he condemns a competing ideological universe, such as Marxism, a priori simply because it is a competitor, he has safeguarded his orthodoxy within the American military culture - but he has also lost the ear of non-Americans who do not look at socio/political/economic reality through Locke-tinted glasses. To be effective and credible, a PSYOP challenge to Marxism must evaluate it rationally and then propose a rational alternative to it which is conceptually and demonstrably superior. To respond only with an indignant denunciation else is merely to indulge oneself in the equivalent of emotional name- calling, which may be satisfying and reassuring but does not adjust matters towards the solution of an international/intercultural impasse. By its very nature, then, PSYOP sticks in the craw of American political culture - and of its conventional military establishment. To reach through the body into the mind with the intent of manipulating it is somehow held to be an “unclean” science, a kind of Black Art practiced by mad scientists - but not by straightforward, decent Americans. 40 We have consoled ourselves that we do it not because we want to, but only because the “other side” does it and we have to counter 40 “Psychological Warfare has always rested as an uneasy activity in democracies, even in wartime. It is partly to do with the suspicion that using the mind to influence the mind is somehow unacceptable. But is it more unacceptable to shoot someone's brains out rather than to persuade that brain to drop down their weapon and live?” - Philip M.

The human can never see his dog in quite the same way once it has tasted human flesh. [Presumably the dog also sees humans, including his master, somewhat differently.] Since PSYOP is conspicuously outside the norms of the American military culture, its practitioners also carry something of a taint. It would be even more of a taint if they were perceived [or allowed] to develop their arcane art to its potential limits, but [until the advent of MindWar] they are not. Like a sentry-dog on a leash, PSYOP is not allowed to “run wild”, adjusting values, thoughts, and behavior according to unorthodox and mysterious criteria. It has been placed firmly and decisively in support of “normal/traditional” military operations as a “combat support” element - a “battlefield janitor” of PW’s emotional stresses, fears, and susceptibilities. In practice this has severely limited the effectiveness of military PSYOP as a means to change the ideological and ethical opinions of the enemy; it renders PSYOP useful only as a means to communicate surrender messages to opposing forces on the battlefield, or to issue controlling instructions to civilians in the area. “Orthodox” themes reaching beyond such simple, direct messages are quickly perceived as sloganistic, hence discounted by all but the most primitive audiences. The technique of interviewing captured or surrendering recipients - at the implicit end of a gun-barrel - is unlikely to elicit sincere comments as to the effectiveness of such propaganda; self-interest dictates an answer contrived to be pleasing to the interrogator. 41 “We occasionally do very wicked things, and in our weighing up the moralities we rather go in for dishonest comparisons; after all, you can’t compare the ideals of one side with the methods of the other, can you now?” - Control to Alec Leamas, in John Le Carré’s The Spy Who Came In From The Cold (New York: Pocket Books, 1963). “[U.S. Army PSYOP includes] unpardonable methods of ideological sabotage including blackmail, provocation, and terror.” - T.

D. Evolution to MindWar Branch The new MindWar Branch (MWB) not only permanently retires PSYOP/“MISO”’s role as an embarrassing “battlefield janitor”, but emplaces it at the very center of future Army operations. Henceforth all Army missions begin with MW campaigns, with PW operations initiated only in the event of MW’s failure. MWB functions as the “controlling brain” of the MW campaign, determining, evaluating, and modifying the subject-situation conditions causing the problem. During the detection, evaluation, and preparation Phases of the campaign (Phases 0-2), it accomplishes this through the means outlined in Sections #F & G of this chapter. Once and only if sufficient subject adjustment has been accomplished, the on-site human components of the MW campaign - first MetaForce (Chapter #4) and then ParaPolitics (Chapter #5) are inserted. At all times following such insertion, MWB maintains its “umbrella” over the entire environment, further adjusting it as necessary. It does not close this umbrella until all on-site MW assets are removed. The old PSYOP doctrine called for techniques to induce confusion, fear, and obedience in the face of U.S. PW operations. It made liberal use of secrecy, lies, rumors, deception, and anything else to degrade and demoralize the faceless, human-dignity-undeserving “Enemy”. It sought to incite alienation and if possible defection from the Enemy of its soldiers and civilians alike, thus fragmenting the underlying political and social system. MWB has nothing to do with any of this. It never lies or selectively distorts the truth. It respects every human being as having the same worth, dignity, and right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” no matter what his/her nationality or culture. It does not disrupt existing social or cultural institutions. The “Enemy” in MW is never other human beings; it is the problem which has caused such humans to destabilize their behavior dangerously or destructively.

The result is a solution both understandable by and - 65 -"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"satisfactory to the native population indefinitely after the MW campaign ceases and all U.S. assets are withdrawn. We next turn to the operational universe of MWB, and the tools it uses therein. This involves the nature and functioning of human thought processes and the techniques (“Psycontrols” [PC] or PSYCONs) used both separately and in combination to influence these. E. Thought Architecture In order to influence and control the human mind, MW must first know how thoughts are inspired and constructed. This requires an identification of the two types of thought emergence: the unconscious and the conscious . Despite the fact that 95% of thinking is subconscious, most people assume that their opinions, ideas, and conclusions are all conscious decisions. 42 Indeed much of traditional MISO is based upon this assumption: that it is the deliberately- constructed ideas of an audience which are the target. This is why such campaigns are so ineffective. 1. Unconscious Thought a. Prevalence When a human perceives a situation, action, and/or other humans, an instant, unconscious framing of the sensation occurs before there is any conscious reaction or evaluation. Indeed it is the very immensity and habituation of this framing that makes it unnoticeable and unremarkable. Thus the sound of gunfire in the vicinity of one’s home elicits alarm, while near a military rifle range it would not. Approaching an intersection triggers accustomed expectations of vehicular and pedestrian behavior, the sequencing of traffic lights, and lane/crosswalk pathways. As an individual encounters different surroundings with different inhabitants, instant classification of them takes place; this is sometimes called “instinct” or “assumptions taken for granted”. 42 Cf. Leonard Mlodinow, Ph.D., Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior (New York: Pantheon, 2012). - 66 -"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"This picture is also assumed to be common to all who experience it, but it is in fact markedly unique to each individual. The sum total of all one’s cultural indoctrination, education, experiences, prejudices, desires, and emotions serves as the lens through which it it is “perceived as reality”. While the concept of unconscious thought extends well back into antiquity, it received its first modern appreciation from the philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Bishop Berkeley’s subjective idealism had held that nothing could be known objectively - that knowledge is limited to subjective impressions. Kant refines this into what is called critical idealism , in which human thought is subdivided into sensation , understanding , and pure reason . Sensations and understanding of them and consequences of them can be proven, Kant says, but pure reason (concepts unsupported by sensations) cannot be conclusive. It is “beyond causality”. It is the first two processes - sensation and the overlay of understanding upon that sensation - which result in Kant’s “construction of reality”. This “reality” contains predispositions concerning physical surroundings, such as one’s like or dislike of the terrain, climate, elevation, level of development, etc. It also includes assumptions concerning the population, both individually and en masse , of which some are politically and culturally acceptable and others not. For instance race, religion, sex, the role of the genders, slavery, economic systems, and political ideologies are all factors with extremely powerful influence, but about which open discussion is severely constrained by convention and taboo. Identifying and overcoming such taboos are a major challenge to MWarriors not just in Phase 1 but throughout the entire MW campaign. But it is a challenge which cannot be avoided or sanitized if the MW campaign is to succeed. b. Pattern Thinking Unconscious, non-deliberate thought manifests itself not in articulated expressions or ideas, but in overlays or “patterns” into which the sensory impressions are placed and assumed to have significance. 43 43 With a political, social, and cultural context, cf. in particular Valerie M. Hudson, Philip A. Schrodt, & Ray D. Whitmer, A New Kind of Social Science: The Path Beyond Current (IR) Methodologies May Lie Beneath Them .

At most individuals or groups can be forced or enticed to not-comply with them temporarily, but as soon as the threat or bribe is removed, the “reality”-patterns will reassert themselves. Societies frequently see such patterns articulated as traditions, norms, or other expressions of dominant values, often reduced to simplistic dogma, slogans, or ideologies. 2. Conscious Thought Distinct from the unconscious is consciousness, which accounts for the remaining 5% of human mental activity. It is generally divided into two realms: a. Algorithmic Algorithmic thought (Plato’s dianoia , Hegel’s “dialectic idealism”) is what is normally understood as logical or observable reasoning: a math problem or the speed of a nearby car. Unlike pattern-thinking, algorithmic thinking is conscious, deliberate, effort-demanding, and transitory: the moment a particular stimulation no longer demands it, an algorithmic thought retreats into increasingly-vague memory, then if sufficiently ignored it eventually disappears. Traditional MISO propaganda is so ineffective because it is algorithmic; it makes arguments for reasoned behavioral changes, not recognizing nor appreciating the dominant power of the unconscious patterns governing that behavior. b. Conceptual Conceptual thought (Kant’s “pure reason”, Plato’s nœsis , Nietzsche’s “horizon building”) begins from the apprehension of one’s conscious self as an existential reality: the ba of ancient Egypt, the psyche of the Greeks, the Golden Flower of the Tao , the soul of Judæo-Christianity, identifying, in the words of Dr. Raghavan Iyer, “... not the shadowy self or false egoity which merely reacts to external stimuli. Rather there is that Eye of Wisdom in every person which in deep sleep is fully awake and which has a translucent awareness of self-consciousness as pure, primordial light.” - 68 -"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Conceptual thought then extends to ideas, envisions, and expressions radiating creatively from that affirmation. While central to the very essence of humanity and its innate value independent of all utilitarian concerns, the soul is unidentifiable to and untouchable by MW; nor is it of MW concern. It exists in metaphysics, while MW is interested in the unconscious and algorithmic-conscious analysis and control of the mind. F. Liminal Methods The situational participants may be contacted directly and overtly by the MW team, informed of the team’s assigned goal, and invited to cooperate in achieving it. If this sounds like an odd, even naïve way to fight a war, consider that many international conflicts are the result of misunderstandings, narrowly-focused vision, and emotional grandstanding. If conflicts can be objectively and comprehensively defined, and the situational condition identified as something whose resolution is advantageous and prestigious to the conflicted participants, that is the simplest and most direct path to completion of that MW-Matrix component. 1. Voluntary Psycontrol (VPC) If a cooperative consensus cannot be reached, the team must identify the factors preventing it and attempt to correct or remove them. These may be simple or complex, expensive or incidental financially, and/or in or out of the direct control of the target actors. If the MW team can resolve these by its own skill, and with financial/materiel assets accessible to it, it should continue its efforts. 2. Involuntary Psycontrol (IPC) If a cooperative consensus cannot be created, the MW team proceeds to create consensus by MW technology: involuntary Psycontrol (IPC) of the enemy actors. IPC takes two forms: Liminal (LIPC) and Subliminal (SLIPC). - 69 -"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"3. Liminal Involuntary Psycontrol (LIPC) a. The Influence Continuum The primary vehicle for liminal IPC (LIPC) is the Influence Continuum (described in #A.6 above), which supersedes the old Black/ Grey/White propaganda methodology and model. A tailored Influence Continuum may be directed towards either the situation participants themselves or other individuals or groups who can influence those participants in the desired direction. Normally the least forceful of the Continuum stages necessary to achieve cooperative stabilization will be employed, and the LIPC component of the MW campaign coordinated with the others towards the common, immediate goal of the áristos . MW LIPC is effective because it first identifies the governing thought patterns, then stimulates individuals’ core reality-lenses to interpret them in the desired way. The next evolution in LIPC will be to electronically map thought patterns which have the same impact among all humans sharing them, and to artificially generate and transmit them to target groups through electronic media. 44 b. Liminal Involuntary Psycontrol Constriction Beyond direct LIPC communication, desired courses of action may further be encouraged by the removal or limitation of alternatives. If a conflict entity is considering PW, for instance, constriction of its financial resources and/or military supplies may make this option impractical. Where possible, such choice-constrictions should be done without explanation or publicity, so as not to highlight them as PW threats or actions. The sole purpose of such constrictions is to channel the conflict participants toward a MW solution. 44 Cf. “Neuroscientists Unlock Shared Brain Codes”, Medical Press, October 20, 2011. http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-10-neuroscientists-brain-codes.html - 70 -"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The inverse of alternative constriction - enticements or promises of rewards for LIPC cooperation, such as economic or military aid - should be avoided. Such bribery discredits the LIPC process in the eyes of both participants and onlookers, and opens the door to insincere, pro forma results subject to contemptuous discard the moment such bribes are delivered. Rewards for a successful LIPC operation come about naturally and incidentally, in which case respect and appreciation for the LIPC solution will be that much stronger and more durable. G. Subliminal Involuntary Psycontrol (SLIPC) Subliminal LIPC (SLIPC) encompasses the entire spectrum of external influences upon the natural processes of human thought, awareness, alertness, and disposition. These influences are both naturally and artificially adjusted to maximize the subjects’ inclination to receive and positively respond to both. MW LIPC, which relies upon conscious sensory transmission and reception, may be supplemented by subliminal IPC techniques addressing non-conscious receptors of a target actor’s mind and body. Here the objective is not to do bodily or mental damage, but rather to incline the target to be more receptive to LIPC. 1. Pre-MindWar Programs The last half of the Twentieth Century saw numerous experiments in thought-control and extrasensory perception (ESP), some sponsored by various U.S. government agencies. Their common characteristic is that they did not work; they were all attempts to control thought at its expression, not its construction. Briefly summarized: a. MKDELTA/MKULTRA/MKSEARCH The CIA’s and Defense Department’s “mind control” experiments of the 1950-70s were an effort to achieve LIPC through drugs and other invasive means, which in the case of drugs resulted only in confusion and disruption of the human brain’s neurological functions. This series of programs completely missed the point that thoughts are the manifestation of mental cohesion, not disintegration (which, since it - 71 -"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"harms the subject, is impermissible in MW). 45 b. Project Stargate/ESP Beginning in 1973 first the CIA, then the NSA, and finally DOD embarked upon a $20 million series of “ESP” experiments together with the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). 46 Originally entitled “Project Scanate”, 47 in 1995 it was retitled “Project Stargate”. 48 Stargate attempted “remote viewing” experiments, which failed due to the simple fact that the transmission of visual information to the brain does not occur outside of the visible electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), approximately 400-790 THz. It is impossible for EMS waves in this range to survive coherently through atmospheric interference at the extensive distances proposed by SRI. Moreover the electrical impulses within the brain are far too weak even to escape the skull, much less travel any distance beyond it. 49 45 Cf. John Marks, The Search for the “Manchurian Candidate”: The CIA and Mind Control (New York: New York Times Books, 1979). MKULTRA was established by the CIA in 1953 as a successor to the 1952 MKDELTA. Its purpose was to explore various means of controlling human behavior, of which psychedelic drugs such as LSD were merely one option. Cf. Martin A. Lee & Bruce Shlain, Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond (Revised Edition) (New York: Grove Press, 1994). In 1965 DOD initiated a successor to MKULTRA named MKSEARCH, which was limited to drug-behavioral modification only. It was terminated in 1973. Cf. Congressional Record , Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources, September 20, 1977, “Human Drug Testing by the CIA, 1977”. 46 SRI is not connected with Stanford University. 47 Inspired by the then-sensational “Watergate”. 48 Inspired by the then-sensational 1994 science-fiction film Stargate , though that film did not contain any ESP themes. 49 To light a flashlight bulb a human would need to generate about 30 million times his present level of brain current.

The range and scope of these files far exceeded anything in the CIA/DIA libraries on this topic. 50 One of the most rigorous and conclusive analyses was conducted in 1977 by E. Balanovski and J.G. Taylor of the Department of Mathematics, King’s College, London. The TP files contained detailed reports of their findings, including an extensive article in Nature magazine #276, November 2, 1978. After having reviewed previous experiments attempting to test ESP for EM emission, B&T declared their dissatisfaction because of imprecise test conditions, exclusion of parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), and inadequate write-ups of the results. They determined to cover the entire EMS, and to do so under the most rigorous test conditions possible. The battery of sensors they assembled included skin electrodes, electrometers, magnetometers, loop antennae, crystal detectors, horn antennae, thermocouples, electric thermometers, infrared detectors, and ultraviolet detectors. Many of these sensors overlapped one another’s frequency range, and altogether they covered the entire EMS from 0 to 3x10 5 GHz. Before the first experiment could be conducted, extensive test-running of all these sensors had occurred in order to record and filter out the irrelevant EM “noise” in the test areas, including passing cars and TV/radio station broadcasts. Readings were recorded on strip chart recorders, video tape recorders, and direct photographs of oscilloscope and frequency analyzer screens. The efficiency of this battery of devices was quickly evident, and the study concluded: 50 The Transformation Project was initiated in 1976 by Michael Murphy, founder of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, James Hickman, and Steve Donovan as a database of over 9,000 files to correlate the world’s research on ESP. They had dialogued extensively and exhaustively with Soviet ESP scientists, and traveled widely in the USSR throughout the 1970s. Murphy wrote up the results in thinly-disguised “fiction” such as Jacob Atabet (1977) and An End to Ordinary History (1982). Cf. Jeffrey J. Kripal, Esalen (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007). - 73 -"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"We have tried to detect EM signals emitted by people, and in particular the Fourier spectrum of such signals, to test the reality of ESP phenomena. All experiments failed to yield any unusual EM radiation. It is possible to conceive transmission of EM energy from one person to another, or of emission by one person in a manner undetectable by the apparatus we have used. This would have been so if very brief pulses of EM energy were used in such signaling with times less than the response time of the corresponding apparatus at the frequency used. There are no known mechanisms in the body able to produce such signals at the power levels required to produce the effects. We have also found that humans are insensitive to low levels of EM. A possible mechanism for such signaling is therefore clearly ruled out for telepathy and distant-viewing. The EM levels emitted to achieve metal-bending [in the microwave range to achieve the desired focusing] are joules, and there is no known mechanism in the body to achieve a peak power output of GW; it is difficult to suppose that this would be possible without severe tissue damage. Summarily the human brain can by itself neither send nor receive the stuff of which specific thoughts are made - save through the media of the physical senses. Therefore ESP does not occur, nor do purely mental efforts to produce physical effects (psychokinesis/PK). Apparent successes in these fields are either coincidental, the results of non-mental physical phenomena (magnetic fields, gravity, etc.), or deliberate deception by clever stage-magic trickery. 51 c.

Training time was reduced almost by half for the NLP group. To the extent that it decreases reaction time to unexpected situations or confrontations, NLP (whether by that or any other name) would be valuable for Special Forces personnel entering an unknown environment, as in MW Phases #0 & #1. In 1985 forty Army soldiers undergoing Russian language training were divided into two groups, one of which was trained according to a technique called “Suggestopedia”. Developed in the 1970s by the Bulgarian psychotherapist Georgi Lozanov, it involved t’ai ch’i -like calisthenics, followed by mental relaxation & breathing exercises, followed by “guided imagery” to reduce students’ natural resistance to learning.

It was never physiologically validated, and its claimed psychological results may simply be attributed to habit and skill resulting from concentration and repetition, much as a martial art. 54 In 1985 the Army commissioned a two-year, $425,000 report from the National Research Council, an agency of the National Academy of Sciences. Among the topics reviewed were stress management, biofeedback, accelerated learning, PK, ESP, and “remote viewing”. On December 8, 1987 the NRC report, entitled Enhancing Human Performance , was released.

PSYCON #1: Homo Electromagneticus Along with all other matter/energy displacements in the material universe, the human body is a complex electromagnetic (EM) machine, including its thought processes. Humans, of course, don’t normally think of themselves as machines, but as conscious, unique beings. This casts humanity in not a physical but a metaphysical image, and explains both the basis for and the attraction of religions. In the 1980s breakthrough research in the EM constitution of man began to emerge. Dr. Robert O. Becker, an orthopedic surgeon whose curiosity had been aroused by the regenerative powers of certain animals. 55 He set out to identify and explore the link between EM and living tissue. In doing so he sought out relevant discoveries by fellow scientists: Francis Ivanhoe, a pharmacologist and anthropologist at two universities in San Francisco, made a statistical survey of the braincase volume of all known Paleolithic human skulls, and correlated the increase with the magnetic field strength and major advances in human culture during the same period. Ivanhoe found bursts of brain-size evolution at about 380- 340,000 years ago, and again at 55-30,000 years ago. Both periods correspond to major ice ages, the Mindel and Würm, and they were also eras when great cultural advances were made - the widespread domestication of fire by Homo erectus in the early Mindel, and the appearance of Homo sapiens sapiens (Cro-Magnon peoples) and gradual decline of Neanderthals ( Homo sapiens ) during the Würm. Two other glaciations in the same time span - the Ganz ca. 1,200-1,050,000 years ago and the Riss ca. 150-100,000 years ago - didn’t call forth such obvious advances in human evolution. They also differed from the other two in that the average geomagnetic field intensity was much lower. 55 A hydra cut in half will quickly develop into two hydras, for example, and the salamander can completely replace amputated legs and tail - all at once if necessary - as well as its jaw and eye lenses. - 76 -"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Ivanhoe has proposed a direct link from the magnetic field through the growth-hormone regulator pathways in the brain to account for the sharp evolutionary gains. He suggests that part of the hippocampus, a section of the brain’s temporal lobe, acts as a transducer of EM energy. A part of the hippocampus called Ammon’s horn, an arch with one-way nerve traffic directed by a strong current flow, may read out variations in the field strength, feeding them by a bundle of well-documented pathways called the fornix to the hypothalamus and thence to the anterior pituitary, where growth hormone is produced. It’s known that larger amounts of this hormone in pregnancy increase the size of the cerebral cortex and the number of its nerve cells in the offspring, as compared with other parts of the brain. Ivanhoe also notes that the hippocampus and its connections with the hypothalamus are among the parts of the brain that are much larger in humans than in other primates. The idea gains further support from the fact that neural activity in the hippocampus increases with electrical stimulation and reaches a maximum at 10 -15 cps, at or slightly above the dominant micropulsation frequency of today’s field. 56 Becker also came across evidence, from both from his own and others’ research, that certain kinds of EM radiation (EMR) can either generate or accelerate damage to living organisms. He cited the instance of the Russian researcher, Yuri Kholodov, who found areas of cell death in the brains of rabbits after subjecting them to 100-200 Gauss magnetic fields. The fields were found to have activated stress hormones within the rabbits, but in a way that the rabbits could not consciously sense any stress. In 1969 Becker was one of the scientists asked by the U.S. Navy to review possible side-effects from Project Sanguine, the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) transmitter the Navy intended to build in Wisconsin to communicate with nuclear submarines. He observed: The only thing sanguine we found was the name ... The antenna would produce an EM field 1 million times weaker than that from a 765-kilovolt power line. It was to broadcast at 45-70 Hz, frequencies close enough to the Earth’s micropulsations that living things are very sensitive to them. 56 Robert O.

The generalized stress response, desynchronized biocycles, and interference with cellular metabolism and growth processes were also distinct possibilities. 57 The essence of the danger posed by EMR to living organisms is that ELF radiation of 30-100 Hz appears to interfere with the body’s normal biological cycles. Results may include a continuous condition of mild stress throughout the organism, often triggering its various immune and disease-fighting systems. As the body adapts to the ongoing presence of these systems, their combative effect on serious infections and diseases is lessened. EMR can also cause change in strains of bacteria, enhancing their growth and resistance to antibiotics. 58 Other experiments examined by Becker yielded implications that: • Microwave exposure can cause decreased energy levels in the brain by inhibiting electron transport chain function in brain mitochondria. • Even very weak ELF fields, such as that produced by a TV set 60 feet away, can both accelerate and decrease human reaction time. • A statistical study of suicide events in the vicinity of overhead high-voltage power lines revealed that magnetic fields averaged 22X higher at suicide addresses, and that areas with the strongest fields contained 40X more fatal locations. 57 Ibid . Dr. Becker’s committee recommended that Project Sanguine be shelved pending further data in these problem areas. The Navy marked the report “For Official Use Only” and eventually moved the project to Michigan, renaming it “Project Seafarer”. A new review committee was chosen; Becker was not on it. In 1978 the project was redesigned and renamed “Austere ELF”, was again the subject of great controversy, and in 1981 again renamed to “Project ELF” and made operational by the Reagan Administration. 58 This, suggested Becker, might account for the onslaught of “new” diseases since 1950, many of them developing from pathogens previously incapable of inducing disease. Among these: Reye’s syndrome, Lyme disease, Legionnaire’s disease, AIDS, and Herpes. - 78 -"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"• Animals exposed to EMR undergo a variety of blood changes, such as decline in red cell count and hemoglobin concentration, hence oxygen capacity. • EMR of the sort received by many people in “home” environments may reduce the strength of electrical impulses governing contraction of the heart muscle by as much as 50X. • There is an increasing body of evidence that cell-division-related diseases, such as cancer, are aggravated by EMR. • Improperly or inadequately shielded video terminals may be a factor in the extremely high numbers of women computer operators experiencing miscarriages, stillbirths, and birth defects. In 1985, when humans’ exposure to EMR was considerably less than in the “Information Age” of 2012, Becker summarized his findings: It may be hard to convince ourselves that something we can’t see, hear, touch, taste, or smell can still hurt us so dreadfully. Yet the fact must be faced, just as we’ve learned a healthy fear of nuclear radiation. Certain scientists, some perhaps acting in a program of deliberate disinformation, keep telling the public that we still don’t know whether electropollution is a threat to human health. That’s simply not true. 59 It is clear that if MW is going to reach into the minds of humans (the United States’ own MWarriors and the leaders, military, and citizenry of MW-campaign geopolitical areas), EM is an essential key to unlocking and changing them. But it is a key which must be used with the utmost care and precision, lest it create more danger and damage than it prevents. 3. PSYCON #2: Brainwave Resonance (BWR) EMR in the brain occurs in waves measured according to cycles per second (Hz). 1-3 Hz = delta waves, characteristic of deep sleep. 4-7 Hz = theta waves, characteristic of high emotion, violence, and frustration. 8- 12 Hz = alpha waves, characteristic of meditation, relaxation, and 59 Ibid . - 79 -"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"“searching for patterns”. 13-22 Hz = beta waves, characteristic of frontal brain activity, deliberate effort, and logical thought. Concerning the EMS, the principle of resonance is: (1) a vibration of large amplitude in a mechanical or electrical system caused by a relatively small periodic stimulus of the same or nearly the same period as the natural vibration period of the system. (2) the intensification and enriching of a musical tone by supplementary vibration that is either sympathetically or mechanically induced. Brain-waves are subject to the principle of resonance. Energy-waves reaching the brain through any medium - eyes, ears, or flesh - will tend to induce the brain-waves to cycle at the same wavelength. A common example of visual resonance is the seizures that some people experience when exposed to a light flickering at 10 Hz. The audio spectrum - being the range of sound vibrations which human hearing can consciously detect - is from 15 Hz (bass) to 20,000 Hz (treble). The infrasonic range - 10-15 Hz - is too low to be consciously detected but is nonetheless capable of inducing resonance in the brain. Below infrasound [and sometimes encompassing it] are Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves, which are powerful and durable enough to travel through the Earth for communication with submerged submarines. Brainwave resonance (“BWR”) is significant to SLIPC in both passive and active contexts. Passively a human-interactive environment may be permeated with EMS waves at one or more of the BWR ranges, inclining those within it to their induced characteristics without their conscious awareness. Attempting a relaxed, pleasant, cooperative discussion of a mutual problem is more possible in an alpha BWR than in a non-BWR one, and much more possible than in a beta one. Trying to accomplish anything complex or creative immersed in delta is exhausting and fruitless. This being the case, it is remarkable how much human interactivity occurs in complete ignorance and disregard of BWR conditions. MWarriors should routinely sample any environment in which they intend to work, to detect negative BWR so that it may be neutralized or replaced with positive BWR. When neutralization or replacement is not - 80 -"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"possible, the MW interaction should be moved to a different, more supportive location. Active employment of BWR utilizes frequency generators to project desired BWR into a MW operational environment, to adjust the emotions and awareness of all individuals therein. Such generators may be strategic satellite-based platforms which transmit BWR both directly and through intrusion into existing, localized electronic media systems. BWR can, for instance, be inserted into the Internet to be passively and indetectably (absent such sensors) received and radiated by any accessing device, from television station to desktop computer or cellular telephone. On a more controlled level, MWarriors may carry personal BWR generators to influence just their immediate surroundings. Depending upon the circumstances, this may be done either overtly or covertly. BWR SLIPC should not be regarded as merely something to “use against” someone else. Rather it is useful to remove antagonistic or disruptive emotions and replace them with receptive and cooperative ones. Here again it is important to remember that MW always redefines “the enemy” as the problem situation affecting all of the human participants, not any segment of the participants themselves. Accordingly what BWR SLIPC seeks to do is to place everyone, including the MWarriors themselves, in the same positive BWR range. It is well that this is so, because it would be next to impossible to shield anyone within a BWR SLIPC environment to its effects. The infrasonic EMS ranges travel through almost any substance, and enter the human body merely by encountering any of its surfaces. Frequency- cancellation earphones might affect BWR entering through the hearing anatomy, but would offer no protection whatever for the body’s entire skin surface. Summarily all MW planning and operations should be carried out within BWR-controlled environments, which requires first their detection and then, as appropriate, their adjustment. 4. PSYCON #3: Magnetism As the phenomenon of magnetism is integral with electricity, and human mental activity is electric, it is unsurprising to find that magnetic fields, while not affecting the body’s metabolism to a significant degree, due to the extremely small amount of ferromagnetic material therein, can influence thought itself. - 81 -"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"As discovered through MRI imaging, the area of the brain in which evaluations and opinions about others’ beliefs and morality are made is the tempero-parietal junction (TPJ). In 2010 MIT neuroscientists discovered that application of a magnetic field to the right TPJ, by means of a noninvasive technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) temporarily disrupts an individual’s ability to make judgments based upon previously-learned morality. In effect, pre- indoctrination is suppressed, resulting in the subject’s tending to judge situations more on a discrete cause-and-effect basis. In theory, TMS could be used to condition personnel to make decisions unencumbered by prior moral, social, or ethical indoctrination; and to remove that same protective indoctrination from a hostile individual being interrogated. TMS thus approaches in scientific reality the mythical “brainwashing” of classic conspiracy legend. 60 The present limitations of TMS from a MW perspective are that its effects are only temporary, and that the magnetic field needs to be precisely created in close proximity to the TPJ. The establishment of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between magnetism and morality, however, opens the MW door to the long-sought “holy grail” of SLIPC: the removal of preexisting moral beliefs. Unlike BWR, magnetic fields can be generated and focused directionally, in precisely-calculated strengths. A precisely-configured TMS field directed at hostile humans motivated by intense moral conditioning (as in a deeply-held religious belief or irrational political ideology) can instantly dismantle or at least substantially weaken this barrier to communication and situational reasoning. The 1990s’-emergent technique of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) opens new potential for both the reading of human thoughts and the implantation of them. In fMRI magnetic sensors detect blood-flow activity within the brain with such precision and accuracy that the result can be used by a computer to assemble an accurate image of the subject’s visualization from a database of standardized components. In reverse, fMRI may eventually be able to transmit them. 61 60 Cf.

PSYCON #4: Chronobiology Chronobiology (“CB”) is the science of the influence of states and periods of time upon biological entities. CB oscillations - the “ticking of biological clocks” - occurs at an extensive number of levels in the human body, from the cellular to the entire organic body, and at velocities from the milliseconds to the multiples of years. MW is concerned primarily with the CB attuned to and governed by the solar (“circadian”) day. It is this entrainment which makes the MWarrior’s mind and body more or less efficient, and the MW subjects more or less receptive and controllable. Some of the human body’s various circadian cycles are immediately and strongly determined by and sensitive to sensory environmental changes. A well-known example is the “jet lag” disorientation and exhaustion experienced when one is rapidly displaced from one day/ night standard to another. 62 Similar effects may be produced by the removal of sensory circadian reinforcement, such as seclusion in a windowless room without a clock, or extended immersion in sensory- deprivation tanks. The more detection and reinforcement supports are removed, the more quickly disorientation and psychosis result. 63 Nevertheless it is not the purpose of MW to disrupt or destroy mental coherence, but rather to make operatives most alert and efficient at what they do, and their audiences most receptive and impressionable to the MW campaign. 62 Cf.

Within a waking period individuals can vary uniquely, though alertness is generally highest after transition from sleep and lowest just prior to the next transition to sleep. Politicians, for example, know that it is best to handle interviews demanding mental alacrity in the morning, while scheduling prepared speeches for late in the day when audiences are most vulnerable and passive. As Adolf Hitler wryly observed: A speaker knows that even the time of day his speech is given is important in determining its effectiveness. The same speech, speaker, and subject produce completely different responses at ten in the morning, at three in the afternoon, and in the evening ... To make it easy for everyone to attend, I set the meeting for a Sunday morning at ten. The result was catastrophic but extremely instructive. The hall was full and the decor stunning, but audience response was glacial. Nobody was enthusiastic, and I was profoundly disappointed at failing to establish any relationship, not even the slightest connection, with my audience. - Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf (Volume II) (Munich: Franz Eher, 1926). Prior to any MW team insertion into a given geographical area, all team personnel should have their CB PRCs adjusted to that location, which can be done through a variety of entrainments, such as Melatonin and controlled light exposure. MW actions designed to impact local individuals, groups, or general populace should also be timed for the CB PRC of greatest receptivity where possible. 6.

Within the FD is the critical distance (“CD”), which, if reached, will trigger the animal to stalk or attack the intruder: A lion in a zoo will flee from an approaching man until it meets an insurmountable barrier. If the man continues the approach, he soon penetrates the lion’s CD, at which point the cornered lion reverses direction and begins to stalk the man. In the classical animal act in the circus, the lion’s stalking is so deliberate that he will surmount an intervening obstacle such as a stool in order to get at the man. To get the lion to remain on the stool, the lion-tamer quickly steps beyond the CD. At this point the lion stops pursuing. The trainer’s elaborate “protective” devices - the chair, the whip, or the gun - are so much window-dressing. - H. Hediger, animal psychologist 65 Human beings also possess FD/CD, as well as an intermediate personal and social distance (“PSD”). Individuals make FD/PSD/CD decisions by sight, hearing, and smell at a distance; and touch up close. In some cultures people are accustomed to being within the smell-radius of others, and in fact judge moods, class, and relationships in part on olfactory impressions. In other cultures, such as that of the United States, the scent of anyone except an intimate is repellent. 66 The human skin’s ability to both transmit and sense emotional states is greater than most people realize. Anger or embarrassment triggers blushing, but it also increases the blood supply to various parts of the body, causing [among other things] subtle swelling of the forehead and temples, and increased skin temperature in those areas. Observers can detect such changes by skin-based thermal detectors, by more intense olfactory sensation (smell), and by visual impact. 67 65 Hall, op.cit. 66 This creates an invisible yet powerful barrier against American rapport with various Mideastern, Asian, and African societies. 67 Some women interviewed by Hall commented that changes in the bodily temperature and odor of dancing partners, for example, were reliable advance-signs of lust, anger, etc. - long before the male in question would speak or act accordingly. - 85 -"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Heat and space-perception are related. People in a cool, crowded room will not feel as cramped as in a hot one. 68 Even photographs and paintings of people create an immediate attitude-impression in a viewer whom they place in FC/PSD/FD of the subject. 69 70 The boundary of each human does not end with the skin. Each individual possesses an unseen “personal field” - or rather variety of them - which constitutes his or her true boundary. The MWarrior who first detects, then control such personal fields thus controls the subject individuals as assuredly as if controlling their conscious personalities. 7. PSYCON #6: Atmospheric Ionization A negatively-ionized atmosphere induces relaxation, alertness, energy, and a general sense of well-being in humans who breathe it [only as long as they continue to breathe it]. By contrast exposure to a positively-ionized atmosphere induces lethargy, exhaustion, irritability, and confusion. In a MW campaign, therefore, it is useful to negatively- ionize the atmosphere not only in the subject geographical area, but in MW facilities themselves. 68 Whether or not you see or hear other persons, your heat-sensors will react to them if you are close enough. To sample your own heat-radiation sensitivity, place the back of your hand close to your lips. Both generate a high level of heat. Then move your hand up and down in front of your face. 69 Four to eight feet is the portrait distance: Here the painter is near enough so that his eyes have no trouble in understanding the sitter’s solid forms, yet he is far enough away so that the foreshortening of the forms presents him no real problems. Here, at the normal distance of social intimacy and easy conversation, the soul of the sitter begins to appear. Nearer than three feet, within touching distance, the soul is far too much in evidence for any sort of disinterested observation. Three feet is the sculptor’s working distance, not the painter’s. The sculptor must stand near enough to his model to be able to judge forms by sense of touch. - Maurice Grosser, The Painter’s Eye (NY: Rinehart & Co.). 70 The Renaissance rediscovered perspective, enabling a viewer to see various parts of a painting proportionately.

Normal atoms consist of an equal number of positively-charged protons [in addition to non- charged neutrons] and orbiting, negatively-charged electrons. An ion is any atom or molecule with a greater number of electrons (negative ion = anion ) or a lesser amount (positive ion = cation ). Such imbalances are caused by external radiation strong enough to disrupt the atom. It is ionizing radiation which accounts for the damage to humans from nuclear bombs: alpha , beta , gamma /X-ray, and neutron. 71 The air humans breathe contains varying mixtures of atoms, anions, and cations. “Air ionizers” do not create ions by radiation; rather they generate an electrical field which causes cations to ground, leaving the air and attaching themselves to the earth or other grounded substances. Consequently a human in the vicinity will breathe a higher percentage of anions, causing the beneficial sensations. Naturally-occurring anionic atmosphere can be caused by electrical discharge (such as lightning) or fast-moving water molecules (rainstorms, waterfalls, sea waves, etc.). As such events can be predicted, or such areas identified, MW should take advantage of them to condition the mental dispositions of individuals subject to them. Cationic air results from dry atmospheric conditions and winds, most significantly katabatic and rain shadow winds. A katabatic wind (such as the California Santa Ana , Adriatic Bora , Japanese Oroshi ) is a wind that carries high-density air from a higher elevation down a slope under the force of gravity. Shadow winds (such as the Alpine Föhn and South African Bergwind ) result when air driven upslope on the windward side of a mountain range loses its moisture before descending on the far side. Cationic air can also be caused by any high-velocity abrasion, such as rough surfaces and sharp angles in air-conditioning or ventilating systems. All MW environments, both planning/operational and subject area, should be pretested for ionization and adjusted [or the people relocated] to the anionic insofar as possible. Within closed areas artificial “ionizers” can be overtly or covertly employed, and in open areas devices for creating favorable atmospheric conditions (e.g. rainstorms) may be both strategically and tactically employed. 71 These designations are unrelated to the brainwave frequencies discussed elsewhere in this work. - 87 -"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Insertion of a MetaForce team into a subject location, for instance, should be preceded and accompanied by an anionic “blanket”, for the safety and efficiency of the team itself as well as for the receptive conditioning of persons or groups it encounters. 8. PSYCON #7: Color In conventional PSYOP colors are used culturally and socially with respect to target audiences. Thus while black is the color of death in the American/European countries, white represents it in China, India, Vietnam, and Korea; and so on. While not ignoring such traditional connotations, MW is more concerned with color as it directly impacts and influences the human brain as EMR. The inclusive scientific discipline is that of photobiology: the study of the effects of light on biological systems. The EMS ranges from a theoretical “long wave” the length of the universe to short, high-frequency waves a fraction of the size of an atom. While the extremes of the EMS are theoretically infinite, for practical scientific measurement the range extends from 0 Hz (hertz = cycles per second) to 10 picometers (a picometer being a trillionth of a meter). Within this vast range of EMR the conscious human senses can detect only the tiny ranges of visible light, heat, and audible sound. Visible light is the color spectrum, from red to violet. It occupies the tiny segment of the EMS from 400-790 THz, EMR capable of exciting the retinal molecules of the human eye. In fact humans can see only three actual colors: red, green, and blue - because the retina contains photoreceptors for just those colors. The ability to distinguish between range of colors is made possible by a protein called opsin . Opsin separates the pigments on the color wavelengths that passes through the cones or photoreceptors present in the eye in order to distinguish one from the other. The “red” photoreceptor in the eye actually detects yellow light, but the brain remaps the yellow-green differential signal to red. Thus humans are trichromats . All of the other colors humans think they “see” are actually the result of their brains evaluating and constructing various red/green/blue mixtures. 72 72 This is why a color television set, for example, contains only red, green, and blue projectors, and, incidentally/amusingly, why the Martians of the classic 1953 film War of the Worlds had “monstrous” red/green/blue eyes.

This is generally presumed to be the result of genetic adaptation to environment, such as nocturnal or underwater existence. Some species of birds and fish are tetrachromats, being able to see ultraviolet. MW, therefore, is interested essentially in the direct brain impacts of these three actual color EMRs, and only incidentally in what habitual or cultural play various brains make of them. Red EMR provokes faster and more forceful responses in humans, regardless of their cultural conditioning. For this reason it can also be counterproductive in situations requiring complex mental or motor skills. 73 Blue stimulates alertness and creativity. Green reduces alertness and memory. 74 MW planning & operational environments, as well as subject areas, should be illuminated and/or shielded accordingly depending upon the desired mental attitude. Note here that, as visible light is a range within the EMS, transmission of that frequency to the audience is all that is required; visually “seeing” it is not. While the human eye’s photoreceptors are triggered by red, green, or blue frequencies, they may also be absorbed into the brain through the ears or skin. Control of color also affects MWarriors’ powers of evaluation and reaction in unexpected situations. Humans make subconscious judgments about encountered persons, objects, or environments within 90 seconds of perceiving them, and color sensation accounts for over 60% of that judgment. 75 73 Cf.

PSYCON #8: Shapes Humans are subconsciously influenced by their apprehension of certain shapes or patterns in objects or pictures. This refers back to the previously-discussed “pattern thinking” phenomenon, and is essentially a categorization of its components. Since the natural tendency of human perception is to unconsciously recognize, classify, and disregard the vast amount of routinely- encountered visual input, anything intended to seize and hold a passive subject’s attention must fulfill what the photographer William Mortensen called the “command to look” (CTL). 76 The CTL consists of three elements: impact, subject interest, and participation. The impact of an image is not intellectual, but biological and subconscious: It is essentially a reaction to the sudden perception of “danger”, signaled by certain shapes, angles, or patterns which are inherently alarming and destabilizing. There are four basic types of these: 1. The diagonal , e.g. the lightning bolt = something that moves swiftly with determination. 2. The S-curve , e.g. the snake (something that approaches in a slithering fashion) or the curves of the body (especially female = “the line of beauty”). 3. Triangle combinations, e.g. a blade, sharp points, or teeth (= the threat of sharpness ). 4. Compact dominant mass , e.g. large animal or trapezoid (= massive block in one’s path). A constructed MW image will contain combinations of these, included with or integrated within the superficial image, to seize and hold the viewer’s attention. Perhaps the most striking illustration of such techniques was the German Expressionist cinema of the early 20th century. As Lotte Eisner observes concerning the 1919 classic Cabinet of Dr. Caligari : 76 William Mortensen, The Command to Look: A Formula for Picture Success .

In Expressionismus und Film Rudolf Kurtz points out that these curves and slanting lines have a meaning which is decidedly metaphysical. For the psychic reaction caused in the spectator by oblique lines is entirely different from that caused in him by straight lines. Similarly, unexpected curves and sudden ups and downs provoke emotions quite different from those induced by harmonious and gentle gradients. But what matters is to create states of anxiety and terror. The diversity of planes has only secondary importance. In Gustav Meyrink’s Golem the houses in the Prague ghetto, which have sprouted like weeds, seem to have an insidious life of their own “when the autumn evening mists stagnate in the streets and veil their imperceptible grimace”. In some mysterious way these streets contrive to abjure their life and feelings during the daytime, and lend them instead to their inhabitants, those enigmatic creatures who wander aimlessly around, feebly animated by an invisible magnetic current. But at night the houses reclaim their life with interest from these unreal inhabitants; they stiffen, and their sly faces fill with malevolence. The doors become gaping maws and shrieking gullets. “The dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created,” Kurtz declared, and this is the explanation of the overpowering obsessiveness of the Caligari sets. 77 Once attracted, that attention must be changed to interest, which is accomplished by the excitement of emotional pattern-thinking. The strongest of such themes are sex, sentiment, and wonder - the time- 77 Lotte H. Eisner, The Haunted Screen .

Finally, and of course most importantly in MW, the viewer’s perception of reality, and consequent behavior, must be transformed by exposure to the attraction of the image. This third CTL element - participation - results from the inclusion of geometric alignments which draw the eye of the viewer along and into the constructed patterns, making them indistinguishable from what the viewer subconsciously considers to be his original values, opinions, and dispositions. 79 10. PSYCON #9: Hypnotism Hypnotism (after the Greek god of sleep, Hypnos) became popularized in the West in the 19th century as a consequence of interest in Asian meditative practices, e.g. Yoga. There followed a century of confusion and experimentation both comical and sinister, as in the CIA’s ARTICHOKE and MKULTRA efforts to create amnesiac assassins a la The Manchurian Candidate . 80 Opportunistic therapeutic and stage- entertainment venues, often difficult to distinguish from one another, have been built up around it, and the claims for its efficacy are indeed mesmerizing. 78 “It is interesting to note,” comments Mortensen, “that women are just as much attracted to the theme of sex when presented in the form of the female nude as men are. Their attraction in this case is vicarious, rather than direct. Their pleasure comes in imagining themselves placed in a situation where they would receive the same admiration that goes out to the theme of the picture.” The sentiment-theme is usually effected through the softer aspects of sex, children, hardships of humble life, domestic life, animals, landscapes, national pride, glamour of the past, etc. The wonder-theme is quite broad and covers the areas of unknown, uncertain, mysterious things, as well as themes of the supernatural, the macabre, etc. 79 In constructing Disneyland, Walt Disney imagineered Main Street to have gently-curved, not sharply-angular streetcorners. Both the Main Street buildings and Sleeping Beauty’s Castle also incorporate the principle of “forced perspective”, with the scaling of each higher level proportionately reduced to make each structure appear taller than it actually is. 80 Cf.

As discussed above, ordinary human sensory awareness is a combination of 95% unconscious impressions and 5% conscious ones. The result is a tsunami of sensations combining to create the individual’s state of mind at any moment. By an effort of concentration, controlled by either oneself (meditation, autosuggestion) or an outside source (a human “hypnotist” or EMS device), this state of constant confusion and distraction can be reduced to “background noise” in favor of a more dominant, constant, and attractive stimulus. The individual is not sent into a state of unconscious ( delta ) sleep, but rather into an alpha state of receptive relaxation. 81 The “hypnotizing” visual object, sound, or other compelling stimulus becomes and remains the center of attention, and along with this attention comes a tendency to automatic compliance with it, or with any variations in it (once again the above-discussed principle of resonance at work). Once the stimulus ceases, its memory will remain with the subject, in varying degrees of influence. This is the actual principle behind audio/visual entertainment media advertising. Watching a television show induces an alpha state of relaxed belief and trust in what one is seeing and hearing. When the program shifts to a commercial message, it impacts that same alpha state, impressing itself on the viewer more effectively than possible were he or she to see or hear the same sales message while in a fully awake and critical beta state. “Being in a state of hypnosis” also allows for fraud on the part of both hypnotist and subject: The hypnotist can issue or commands or give suggestions that he knows will not be obeyed subconsciously/ involuntarily, but simply per the subject’s alpha -passive willingness to believe and cooperate. The subject responds for the same relaxed/ willing reason - because to resist would require a return to the less- pleasant, more demanding beta alertness. What the phenomenon of “hypnotism” means to the MWarrior, then, is simply that insistent, demanding, repeated messages or themes have a crowding-out effect on an audience’s ordinary mental sensations, and that [as Adolf Hitler observed in Mein Kampf , cited in “Chronobiology” above] a relaxed, tired audience is already alpha - receptive to them beyond their intrinsic logic. 81 Cf.

If one takes the time and effort to study the ideas underlying them, however, a substantially different perspective emerges: that of combat as a last resort after resolution of a confrontation cannot be achieved nonviolently. This is not a question of argumentative skills, but rather of body language and a personal presence commanding and calming the tension of an encounter. This is achieved by sufficient education and training in both the physical skills and ethical philosophy of martial artistry. 82 In a MW campaign Phases 0 and 3, MetaForce teams will be on the ground in the geographic area in question, interacting directly with disputing groups and individuals. In Phase 4 ParaPolitics teams will be in the same setting, albeit with the threat of imminent PW alleviated. In any of these situations the presence and brandishing of PW weapons would obviously be counterproductive. If carried, they should be concealed, and their display as a threat or their actual use is to be avoided wherever possible. The chances for such avoidance are substantially increased if all MF and PP personnel are trained and conditioned to react to confrontations as Ninja. 82 Cf.

PSYCON #11: Fields As discussed in PSYCON #1, the human body is an electromagnetic machine. As such it both generates and is enveloped by EM fields (EMF), controlling everything from heartbeat and respiration to sleep and female menstrual cycles. External to the human body, of course, are a great many natural and artificial EMFs, some (such as the Earth’s geomagnetic field) quite substantially larger. Both larger and smaller external EMFs may be weak or strong, and at every instant each human within their range is subject to not just their several effects but combined ones as well. EMFs are subject to the principle of entrainment , which essentially means that a weaker field exposed to a stronger one will tend to align with it; and even a weaker field, if constant, may entrain a stronger but intermittent or irregular one. To understand the significance of EMFs to the human body, it is first necessary to appreciate that each such body is not an inert, static clump of permanent matter. It is rather an organic complex in a constant state of reorganization and reconstitution. For instance, human liver and serum proteins are replaced every 10 days, and the whole of the proteins in the body about every 160 days. Moreover these protein molecules are extremely complex devices, not mere raw material; not even a single amino acid can be out of place in the replacement. To put it another way, there are about 60 thousand billion cells in the human body, and every day about 500 billion of these die and are replaced and rebuilt. Why? One possibility is that these molecules are so complex that they are inherently unstable and thus are continuously deteriorating. The metabolic system, including the liquid-based transmission of food and raw material throughout the body, is a raging furnace of consumption and regeneration. How does the body know precisely how to recreate each cell and molecule? It cannot be within the object itself, because an object cannot “organize itself”. The answer lies in the existence of an entire layered network of EMFs throughout and within the body, altogether comprising a “master plan” EMF for it. Dr. Harold Saxon Burr, Professor Emeritus of Anatomy, Yale School of Medicine, named this the L-Field (for “Life-Field”/LF). 83 83 Harold Saxon Burr.

When something occurs somewhere in space because something else happens somewhere else in space, by no detectible means by which the cause produces the effect, the two events are said to be connected by a “field” [well-known examples being gravity and magnetism]. In the case of the human body, its organizing system cannot be chemical, because then that system itself would be subject to the same entropic process. Hence there is more to a human being than mere chemistry. It requires an organizing field , not merely an accidental accumulation of proteins; thus the notion of “gene randomness” is invalid. Organization inherently requires preconception based upon purpose . Thus human physical existence has purpose; it is not accidental. The ancient Greeks identified this as the principle of τελο ç ( telos ), signifying the inherent end, function or purpose of every phenomenon. [Its most famous modern refutation is Existentialism, which denies not only any purpose to individual entities, but indeed to existence itself.] Anything that can organize must necessarily exist before what it organizes. DNA, for instance, contains “building block” codes, but not the “plan” or motivating force to organize an entire human body out of these “blocks”. If LFs are a natural constant phenomenon, this would account for the general cessation of human physical evolution at least 100,000 years ago [and possibly much longer], as well as for the basic commonality of all human physical construction. Simple Darwinism is inadequate to explain the extreme complexity of higher life, such as development of such mechanisms as Darwin himself called “evolutionary novelties” - the eye and various complex organs. Additionally any such “novelties” would have to occur simultaneously for the whole organism to work together. The odds against this are so high that evolutionists simply bypass the question. Where MW is concerned, LFs are important because their preservation or disruption immediately/similarly affects the humans within and controlled by those fields.

Even more interesting to MW is the theory that thought itself exhibits properties of a field-phenomenon. 84 Consider the ability to add 2+2. Like the rest of the human body, the nervous system is also constantly disintegrating and regenerating. So the material of brain cells and connecting nerves may have been completely renewed about 100 times since an adult was first taught addition. As he hasn’t been taught addition all over again 99 times, how does he still know how to add? This is a question not of mere memory, but of the structure of thought organization and integrity. The interaction and entrainment of such “T-fields” (TF) may account for individuals’ abilities to sense, emulate, or inculcate moods, impulses, desires, and fears in others, both individually and en masse . 85 Just as LFs are distinct from the physical body they create and organize, so TFs are superior to and separate from the physical machinery they manipulate and use. 86 That TFs also have the ability to entrain LFs may explain the well-known phenomena of mental states affecting bodily harmony and health, and vice-versa, as when bodily energy affects mental alertness. In this model, therefore, the brain is properly seen as the mechanism used by one’s primary and subordinate TFs for the cataloguing of sensory input and the storage of memory. These are results , not the thing itself, of the self-aware “thinker”, the primary TF which is individual consciousness of identity and being. Sensory areas of the brain are more or less permanently wired to the respective physical senses, hence their injury or loss is quantifiable and somewhat irreparable. But learning and memory functions are not so localized, as long as enough brain cells remain to be usable. These are used only intermittently and at desire or need. 84 This extrapolation of Dr. Burr’s concept of LFs was proposed by Edward W. Russell in his Design for Destiny (New York: Ballantine Books #23405, 1971). 85 Thus the mysterious human emotional force of “love” may be in effect the entrained harmony of two individuals’ TFs. 86 The phenomena of “ghosts” may thus be the persistence of TFs past the human bodies they previously defined, and “haunted houses” their continued presence in surroundings familiar to them. - 97 -"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"This is why memory is so subtle and elusive a thought-activity.

While an illusion is intended to appear spontaneous, it frequently requires careful advance preparation out of view of the eventual audience. b. Establishment of the magician’s dominant relationship. The magician displays a persona - dress, assertive speech, body language, pressured pace, eye contact - designed to seize and hold the attention of the audience, as well as to gradually but inexorably replace their wills and judgment of reality with his own. [This is particularly essential to hypnotism. 89 ] c. Dictation of the applicable elements. The magician identifies to the audience what objects, locations, and/or procedures are important and essential, restricting the problem to their interaction exclusively. The consequence of this is that an object’s behavior which might seem unremarkable or contrived against ordinary backgrounds or points of reference becomes surprising and inexplicable in this artificial environment. d. Definition of the variables. An object or procedure may be used in any number of ways, but the magician defines them so as to limit these ways to only those which make possible and reinforce the illusion. e.

It is now “impossible” for the objects or procedures to function in any other way, nor for the audience to devise or consider one. h. Interpretation of the result. Once the illusion is produced, the magician makes it clear to the audience what it “obviously” signifies.

As necessary to establish the performed illusion firmly in “reality”, the magician follows it up with as many supporting devices and created impressions as are necessary. Beyond these basics MW is most specifically concerned with the magical discipline of mentalism . 90 This involves diversion of target audience perceptions and interpretations towards a different interpretation of their own thought processes than the one which they would naturally experience. This is accomplished both through the above-listed techniques of magic and appropriate activation and blending of the previous eleven SLIMC PSYCONs.

And if you gaze long into the Abyss, the Abyss also gazes into you. - Friedrich Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil (1886) A. Original Concept The classical image of war is that of two national, uniformed armies, together with their similarly-national, uniformed allied armies, contesting one another on the battlefield in compartmentalized, set- piece engagements. Civilians and communities are not involved, except where battles or troop movements incidentally, accidentally, temporarily spill over into them. This of course has certainly not been the case since the two World Wars, and indeed not generally before them either. People who aren’t soldiers in national armies, who don’t wear uniforms, sometimes get frightened, angry, or just principled enough to pick up a gun, brick, or stone and attack their perceived oppressors. 93 Throughout history such persons or groups have been known by many names, such as “irregulars”, “partisans”, and “guerrillas”. Governments call them “patriots” or “freedom fighters” if they approve of them, and “terrorists” or “insurgents” if they don’t. In World War II the United States sought to ally itself with, and control, anti-Axis patriots and freedom fighters through the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which would develop into the postwar Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 93 “ On the radio talk shows and TV, you hear one thing again and again: how the U.S.A. stands for freedom, and we come to the aid of a friend. But who are the ones we call our friends - these governments killing their own? Or the people who finally can't take any more, and pick up a gun or a brick or a stone?

While this unit is traditionally regarded as the predecessor of the U.S. Army’s Special Forces (SF), its mission more closely resembles that of Ranger units. When SF was established in 1952, its original function was unconventional warfare (UW), being the training and support of guerrilla forces in an enemy nation or its occupied countries, the obvious scenario being a Warsaw Pact-overrun Western Europe. 94 When a Warsaw Pact attack did not materialize, and when instead the U.S. found itself supporting regimes, including extremely repressive ones, that were grappling with communist movements, SF’s function changed to the defeat, not support of UW. The new mission statements were foreign internal defense (FID) and counterinsurgency [later counterterrorism]. The teaching and training function of SF also changed to include special reconnaissance (SR) and direct action (DA), exemplified by MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War. From John Wayne’s personification of the “Green Berets” as warm-hearted, well- intentioned samaritans in his 1968 movie of the same name, SF’s image gradually changed to that of the lone-wolf supercommando portrayed by Sylvester Stallone in his Rambo series of action films. This Jekyll/Hyde odyssey has left today’s SF in something of an identity crisis. It believes it exists “to free the oppressed” [per its famous motto De Oppresso Liber 95 ], yet in the PW universe it more often than not finds itself in locations, with assignments, whose goal is that of repressing domestic rebellion, regardless of local popular or moral motives. 94 “At this time (1952-55) this true ‘Post Strike’ role of SF was TOP SECRET and very closely held. They would go into the enemy area not only for tactical reasons, but because they were trained by the WW2 Civil Affairs & Military Government (CAMG) specialists to help friendly natives reorganize the Soviet government. It was presumed that after a nuclear strike much of the government, communications, transportation, and other infrastructural elements would be decimated.” - Letter, L.F. Prouty to M.

General Y and Colonel X The postwar identity of SF was conceived and implemented significantly by two U.S. Air Force officers, Major General Edward W. Lansdale (1908-1987) and Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty (1917-2001). 96 Lansdale became a UW legend and “man of mystery” during the 1950-53 Huk rebellion in the Philippines, which he significantly helped the Magsaysay government thwart through a creative propaganda campaign blending an active empathy for the populace’s perceived problems with an underlying and ultimately governing commitment to U.S. strategic interests. 97 In March 1954 the National Security Council published document #5412 defining U.S. covert operations, placing the CIA in charge with DOD providing personnel, base, and logistical support. All such operations were to be “plausibly deniable” and no active duty military personnel were to be involved in them. 98 That same year CIA Director Allen Dulles created the Saigon Military Mission (which was CIA, not DOD) and assigned Lansdale to head it. 99 Lansdale moved to South Vietnam, wherein he attempted a similar defeat of the National Liberation Front (aka “Viet Cong”) on behalf of the Diem government. Here, through continuing to be media- glamorized, 100 he was not so successful, since the regime was dealing not with an indigenous movement but one deriving from and actively controlled by North Vietnam. 96 Lansdale and Prouty would later be portrayed as “General Y” and [Colonel] “X” in Oliver Stone’s 1991 film JFK . 97 Jonathan Nashel, Edward Lansdale’s Cold War . Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005, pages #138-9. 98 “This is the real reason why the so-called ‘air support’ myth got started after the Bay of Pigs. Everyone knew beforehand that no active duty military personnel could become involved. It had nothing to do with a JFK decision. McGeorge Bundy called off the JFK-directed air strike on D-Day, and that is what caused the failure.” - Letter, L.F. Prouty to M. Aquino 7/2/95. 99 Ibid. 100 Lansdale was caricatured first in Graham Greene’s 1955 novel The Quiet American , then in William Lederer & Eugene Burdick’s 1958 response The Ugly American , both made into major Hollywood films. - 106 -"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The 1963 downfall of the regime and subsequent introduction of American combat forces effectively eclipsed Lansdale’s efforts in that conflict. Prouty’s UW involvement began in 1955, when, as the USAF’s first Chief of Special Operations, he was both its liaison to the CIA’s MKULTRA and the creator of its global CIA operational USAF support system. 101 In 1960 he was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense where [under first Gates, then McNamara] he served in the same capacity for all the services. Simultaneously Lansdale had become the liaison between OSD and CIA. As Prouty recalls: Lansdale saw an opportunity to expand this combined tactical role even more. He planned to bring the SF, the CIA, and the CAMG people all together. He went down to talk with some friends at the Department of the Army, but the climate was not right and Ed could not get things going. It appeared that the Army did not much care for Special Warfare. This didn’t stop him, and he broadened his contacts to include the old Continental Army Command (CONARC), which supervised the CAMG School and provided him with its curriculum. This he divided among the three of us (Lansdale, Prouty, and Sam Wilson - Wilson was a veteran of the WW2 Merrill’s Marauders). The result was the new SF curriculum at Fort Bragg in 1960, following the JFK election but prior to his inauguration. By the time the SF School began these classes in late 1960, a number of the key officers and instructors were actually CIA under military cover. I was there for the first classes just to see how things worked out. When it was ready for a formal commencement, Deputy SecDef James Douglas did the honors.

But by then the Vietnam War had escalated beyond Lansdale’s possible control. 105 C. Vietnam: Heart of Darkness Upon arrival of U.S. combat forces in South Vietnam, SF was relegated to working with the Montagnards and other non-Vietnamese ethnic groups in the more remote areas of the country, and to conducting clandestine combat, rescue, and cross-border operations under the auspices of MACV-SOG. 106 That SF acquitted itself with great 103 Ibid . 104 Lansdale, according to Prouty, executed the JFK assassination with MONGOOSE assets. “He had hundreds of trained and skilled men whom he could use to flesh out the cover story that the true decision-makers had to have to protect the real hit team, and create the three decades of cover story that has embarrassed American citizens since that date.

The Secretary of the Army dismissed the murder and conspiracy charges when both the CIA and MACV Commanding General Creighton Abrams refused to testify.

By the time of the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions, SF had become essentially an extension of the conventional Army’s occupation presence into areas too remote and inaccessible for conventional units. SF’s “commando” role predominates, with efforts to encourage cooperation by local inhabitants continued as possible. What eludes this posture, however, is a solution to the underlying sociopolitical discontents and imbalances that flow in to regain control of an area whenever SF is not physically present. Thus as with other PW assets, SF has become a treater of the symptoms, not the disease. D. Evolution to MetaForce Branch The evolution of Army Special Forces into MetaForce Branch (MFB) transforms both the way the resource is internally organized and the way it is applied in future MW campaigns. In essence MFB becomes the physical presence of the entire MW campaign in the situation-area, both before the campaign formally commences and until its condition sufficiently stabilizes to permit MFB’s replacement by the ParaPolitics (PP) Branch teams. As with the MW campaign overall, MFB’s mission is to identify, diagnose, and constructively treat the destabilizing “disease” itself, not its symptoms [of local killing and destruction]. While MFB teams are armed, such weapons are both designed and intended only for team protection and that of other humans in instances where all other MW devices have failed. They are a “last resort” and an indicator of MW failure, and are always regarded as such. They are thus always concealed on MFB soldiers’ persons - never openly displayed. They are produced only when it is unavoidably necessary to use them, and then only to a necessary minimum. 107 The 5th Special Forces Group was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) Vietnam 1966-1968, Meritorious Unit Commendation (Army) Vietnam 1968; Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm, Vietnam 1964-1969; Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Honor Medal, 1st Class, Vietnam 1968-1970.

Shaolin Kung Fu For most people the term kung fu brings to mind dramatic unarmed combat by highly-skilled, intensively-disciplined Chinese martial artists [as well as non-Chinese enthusiasts]. This is a misapprehension and oversimplification. The term kung fu translates to “to know what to do”, and it is most properly understood as an entire way of life: a constant harmonizing of oneself with one’s surroundings and the correction of anything inharmonious to its ideal alignment. Traditionally kung fu dates to the 6th century C.E., when the Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma journeyed to the Shaolin Taoist monastery of China and taught the monks a form of active meditative dancing. Over the subsequent centuries this developed into the famous system of acrobatic self-defense. The Taoist and Buddhist roots of the Shaolin discipline, however, are both integral with it and essential to it. Taoism, originated ca. the 5th-6th centuries B.C.E. by Lao Tzu, comprises both the apprehension of the singularity of nature and the quest for conscious melding with it. 108 Buddhism, originating in India in the same approximate time-period, generally prescribes a path to personal enlightenment through a moderate, monastic lifestyle. Consequently kung fu became an active expression of these combined philosophies. The MFB soldier is not expected to be either a Taoist or a Buddhist. What is required of him is a kung fu sensitivity to imbalances in situations to which he is sent, and “knowing what to do” to resolve them. 108 Tao is usually translated as “the Way” [in the sense of the onflowing of the natural universe]. It is most closely reflected in the classic Tao Te Ching , authored by Lao Tzu. - 110 -"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"2. Ch’i Another concept from ancient China is that of ch’i [or qi ], the “life force” of each living being. 109 It is the presence of ch’i which distinguished a living body from a dead one, and which links the physical mechanism with the metaphysical soul. Consequently the strength and concentration of the will are conveyed to the physical senses and structures through ch’i , while diminished or disrupted ch’i results in confusion and exhaustion. Until the late 20th century, Western science tended to dismiss ch’i as a folk myth, since it supposedly could not be detected or measured in the laboratory. What has since transpired is that it was indeed there all along, and completely detectable: It is simply the body’s complete and component EMFs. All physical energy, no matter how it is generated [or, more precisely, converted] is a function of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The human mental processes which command a muscular action, for instance, transmit that command by electrical impulses to that muscle, and the EMS waves or disruptions subsequently detected by the visual, auditory, and tactile receptors signal the accuracy and effectiveness of the action. Ch’i is thus a measurement of the strength and accuracy of such activity, both deliberately and in the body’s unconscious functions [as in the heartbeat, digestion, and breathing]. The smooth flow of ch’i is enhanced, reasonably enough, through proper care of the mind and body: diet, rest, breathing, exercise, and mental coherence. Conscious mental/physical conditioning exercises are known as ch’i kung [or qi gong ] (= ch’i coherence”). While a systematic discipline of ch’i kung is the ideal way to maintain strong and harmonious bodily ch’i , Chinese medicine also proposed to treat specific disruptions of its circulation through the placement of special needles (acupuncture) or massage pressure ( shiatsu ). Less positively, t’ai chi ch’uan martial artists defeat opponents by strikes precisely targeted to disrupt their ch’i flow and coherence. T’ai chi ch’uan , literally “supreme ultimate boxing” is better known in the contemporary West as a smooth-flowing exercise program rather than a combat technique. Indeed, because the ch’i -directed strikes of t’ai chi ch’uan practitioners could, for that very reason, be severely harmful or lethal, they are generally forbidden in martial arts sport competitions. 109 Ch’i was originally and extensively discussed in The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine , 27/2600 BCE. - 111 -"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"As discussed in Chapter #3 under “G.5. PSYCON #4: Chronobiology”, the human body and mind are strongly influenced by external natural cycles, including the geomagnetic field of the Earth. Subtle variations in this field, known as the “Schumann Resonances (SR)”, are detected by magnetically-sensitive particles (magnetite) in the pineal gland of the brain, which regulates the circadian cycle by the generation and release of Melatonin. 110 The SR consist of an EMS field between the Earth and the ionosphere, pulsing at between 7-10 Hz. This tends to entrain humans to alpha (8-14 Hz) BWR, especially during periods of strong, higher-range SR, associated with daylight and atmospheric lightning activity. This is obviously MW campaign-helpful. At night the ionosphere moves higher, resulting in a decrease of the SR towards its lower 7 Hz extreme. This entrains theta BWR, hence altered states of consciousness and similarly- unusual moods and behavior: not MW campaign-helpful. Through the detection and calculation of SR, or what the Chinese termed “external ch’i ”, it may be possible to predetermine circadian mental and physical states of those in MW-campaign areas. In addition to the detection and prediction of externally-influenced ch’i , it is theoretically possible [and asserted by advanced ch’i martial artists] to first consciously regulate one’s own ch’i [e.g. through meditation reduce one’s BWR to theta ] for extreme powers of concentration, then project an even lower BWR of delta (1-4 Hz) into an opponent, thus rendering him dazed or unconscious. 111 The delta BWR is concentrated by the sender in his hands, then extended as an EMF into the opponent, entraining first his pineal gland, then through it his brain’s internal BWR pacemaker, the thalamus. 112 Its thalamocortical neurons experience a “silent phase” every 1-25 seconds, during which time they 110 Cf.

This normally unconscious, passive phenomenon is employed actively and deliberately by the MFB soldier to change both the perceptions and the anticipations of those on whom he is concentrating [whereupon they will look for other droids 114 ]. 115 Summarily the MFB soldier encountering groups or individuals in a MW campaign locale, may augment preconditioning MWB PSYCONs by calculating the influence of external natural EMF/ ch’i , and by self- conditioning and then projecting a calming, positive, or if necessary gently incapacitating personal EMF. 116 3. Negotiation So, let us not be blind to our differences - but let us also direct attention to our common interests and the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s futures. And we are all mortal. - John F. Kennedy 117 113 Cf.

Negotiation Procedure Here it must be emphasized that what is being applied is not just casual, amateur discussion [which in tenuous situations can and frequently does collapse into emotional grandstanding]. Rather it is a disciplined, calculated process based not just upon rational reasoning, but also upon every other factor (emotion, religion, ideology, ethnicity, culture, economics, etc.) which frames and constrains the issue. The MFB team will be pre-practiced in this before it ever touches down. As developed in the classic primer of negotiation technique Getting to Yes , negotiation is not waded into haphazardly. 118 Rather it is carefully structured and executed to reach constructive closure: (1) As with MW generally, the people involved are removed from being the “problem” [or “enemy”]; the problem [or MW “enemy”] is redefined as the situational issues over which there is disagreement and friction. (2) Initially each participant in a disagreement is identified and defined in terms of a position taken and articulated, which tends to an oversimplified caricature of the situation and the belief that it cannot be changed. Hence such positions are not discussed; rather the problem is recontextualized in terms of the participants’ individual and collective interests : with the problem being a/the impediment to their fulfillment. 118 Cf.

(3) Initial disagreements polarize when the issues are condensed into simplistic, either/or lines-drawn.

As each of the component variables is adjusted with an eye to the greatest collective benefit, so the entire matrix will move towards that áristos . (4) Not only the commonality of the problem, but the worth and dignity of all participants involved must permeate the negotiation. Hatred or contempt towards other participants, if sensed [and as is easy to sense], will nullify any attempt at reasoned discussion. 119 b. Physiological Considerations 120 Crucial to negotiation - indeed to the entire concept of MW - is the presumption of orderliness in the human thinking process. We assume that, whether logically, emotionally, or environmentally, the human brain processes impressions, information, and accumulated knowledge methodically and consequentially. This is the entire basis upon which human behavior can be comprehended and predicted, on both the individual and the group level. The unspoken, and all too often ignored assumption in this scenario is that the brain is whole, healthy, and functioning perfectly. Unfortunately this is not always, and perhaps not even mostly the case. 119 This reflects the overwhelming of algorithmic by pattern thought, as discussed in Chapter 4.E. 120 This extremely pertinent and crucial factor was incisively introduced by Dr. William Henry Anderson in “Terrorism: The Underlying Causes”, The Intelligencer (Washington, D.C.: Association of Former Intelligence Officers, Winter/Spring 2004). - 115 -"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The human brain, like other components of the body, requires essential care and insulation from harm from the moment of its prenatal origin if it is to develop and mature fully functional. This tends to be taken for granted in highly-developed countries, where good nutrition, medicine, and safety from environmental hazards (lead, mercury, pollution, etc.) are the norm. In many areas of the world, however, expectant mothers and their subsequent children are malnourished and in peril of numerous diseases. Children may be subject to psychological and physiological hardship from the moment of birth. The outward effects of this can be seen in stunted growth, fragile health, impaired faculties. Not so evident is the condition and capacity of the individual’s brain. While the entire brain may suffer from such inadequacies and injuries, particularly pertinent to the discretionary behavioral process is an area called the amygdala . In concert with the judgment centers of the frontal cortex, it assigns significance and priority to information. If this process is impaired, the result can be distorted or disproportionate opinions or expressions. At minimum this may manifest as a harmless personal fixation. More ominously and extremely it can result in irrational and unchangeable fanaticism. Fortunately extreme cases rarely wind up in political or social positions of authority; they are too conspicuously recognized by others as dangerous “loose cannons”. Less fortunately, this is a sliding-scale phenomenon, where some degree of impairment may not be easily identifiable. Many of history’s most infamous tyrants, from Caligula to Stalin, exhibited a streak of callousness and cruelty which blindsided those about them and confounded later biographers and historians. Central to Plato’s thought, and indeed to the premise of MW, is that no intelligent individual will deliberately choose, or do, evil. Rather it is intrinsic to human nature that we aspire to the Good, the Agathon . 121 When someone makes a decision or takes an action which is apparently evil, therefore, it is the result of either misperception of causal factors or, as noted here, impaired judgment faculties. MFT negotiators, if and when they encounter nonsensical, untouchable fanaticism in confronted persons, obviously cannot undertake to be amateur brain surgeons [even if the amygdala were “adjustable”]. They will either have to overcome the resistance through applied PSYCONs or attempt to marginalize or remove the impeding 121 See Chapter 5 for further discussion of the Agathon . - 116 -"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"personality. 122 Of the several PSYCONs discussed in Chapter #3, it is #12/Magic which is most immediately and easily employable in face-to- face impasses. 4. Magic In situations where all attempts at direct, rational convincing fail, the MFB team next resorts to magic. The essence of magic, as developed in Chapter #3 under “G.13. PSYCON #12: Magic”, is the manipulation of the perceptions of the other party so that he first redefines the problem and its issues for himself, then draws conclusions as to the reality and options available based on that redefinition. In short, if the ostensible problem appears to be unsolvable, change it into one which is. In creating such an alternative, the MFB magician unobtrusively introduces a scenario which addresses the actual problem without seeming to, and this is accomplished not by lying to or deceiving those involved, but by presenting them with impressions that lead them to such interpretations and conclusions by themselves. 123 F. “A Spoonful of Sugar” The function of MFB in a MW campaign is to stabilize the on-site situation sufficiently for the PPB to touch down and commence its reenvision of that situation, as discussed in the next chapter. Thus MFB is not an invasion or occupation entity, and if properly functioning will not be present long enough for the local populace to begin to perceive it as such. If it cannot accomplish its mission in a very short timespan, almost before those encountering it begin to focus on its presence, MWB has failed to adequately precondition the situation. In that case the MFB presence should be withdrawn until it is so preconditioned. 122 This should not be taken to mean abduction or murder. Both easier and more productive are distraction or preemption of such a person’s interest and attention, such that the actual problem of MW concern can be pursued with others. 123 Cf.

Original Concept The need for armies to do something about the human suffering and landed wreckage they left behind them in PhysWar is as old as PhysWar itself. Doing nothing meant increased, prolonged misery and engendering of hatreds that would eventually give rise to new, angrier enemies and wars. Sometimes, as in the case of Troy or Carthage, the victor’s solution was to completely obliterate the vanquished, so that there would be nothing to reemerge from its ashes. But as the object of most PWs was conquest and acquisition of human and territorial assets, such a solution was increasingly impractical. It was the Romans who most famously recognized the need to make allies of those they conquered, granting Roman citizenship generously throughout their empire and extending such benefits as the construction of roads and waterways, and the preservation of social order by Roman garrisons as well. The result was the Pax Romana and a confluence of cultures unprecedented in the ancient world [though previously attempted, but not sustained, by Alexander the Great]. Until World War II the assets used by the U.S. Army for such postbattle cleanup work were hastily and awkwardly thrown together, then abandoned once they had done as much as could be expected of them. It was the challenge posed by the mammoth destruction of Nazi Germany, and the perceived threat of Soviet communist filling of that social vacuum [as indeed happened in the future Warsaw Pact countries], which inspired the Army to take the challenge of reconstruction both more seriously and more permanently. Hence the establishment of the Civil Affairs & Military Government Branch, USAR in 1955. Subsequently Civil Affairs became increasingly involved not just in “battlefield janitor” clean-ups, but, during postwar national destabilizations, in various civic works projects (funded by American money) to try to win the discontented people’s “hearts and minds”. Political and social factors were studiously avoided - not just out of respect for local traditions and politics, but more frankly because CA was neither empowered nor competent to meddle in them. This is where CA has remained, doggedly but frustratingly, until the advent of MindWar. - 120 -"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"B. Political Structures Sequence The most stable, civilized, and pleasant societies of antiquity - such as Egypt, Crete, and Hellenic Greece - share a surprisingly simple, yet subsequently forgotten principle: that of a polis defined, united, and energized by a common moral principle . In Egypt this was the cosmic principle or neter (god/goddess) of Maat , usually simplified as “justice” but more precisely extending to virtue, fairness, and rectitude in all personal and community affairs. There was no concept of individual rights against the government, because government was viewed as a system ordered by the neteru . Similarly each Egyptian, whether high- or low-born, participated in this system. Crime and corruption were of course possible, but inadvisable because of the conviction that vice would be punished severely after Earthly death. Virtue in Mesopotamia was understood as obedience to the willful desires of the god(s), not harmony with their natural principles. The “wrath of the gods” was feared by the state in Mesopotamia, as it was never in Egypt (which was ruled by a god-king). The Mesopotamian king sought the “right ruling” of his community, in accordance with the Akkadian principle of Shulmu (later adopted by the Hebrews as Shalom ): a term meaning not just “peace” but the community well-being that engenders peace. Hellenic Greece includes the civilizations of Crete (b. 2700 BCE), Greece (Mycenæ b. 1600 BCE, Athens b. 600 BCE), the Ægean islands, and Magna Græcia (Sicily and southern Italy). The Hellenic Greek cultures are most notable for exalting the intellect - for making the universe an intelligible tool and/or puzzle for mankind to explore, understand, and use. They did not conceive mankind as having a “mission” from the gods, though the gods could influence human fortunes for good or ill. To the extent that the Greeks put humanity at the “center” of importance, they worshipped its body (as in athletics and the Olympic Games) and its mind (as in the sophistic and philosophical schools of Athens). The Cretan (Minoan) political system, a bureaucratic monarchy most significant for its peacefulness, included no evident slavery, standing military, or marked class distinctions. Women appear to have been politically equal with men. The Minoan culture was destroyed ca. 1400 BCE by an invasion from Mycenæ. The Mycenæan culture, which faded into the Greek “dark ages” within another three centuries, denied - 121 -"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"women equality and did have slavery. The “dark ages” lasted from 1100 to 800 BCE and came to an end with the founding of the first Greek city-states. The first Greek writing appears in about the 8th century BCE, with the first dated writing in 600 BCE. The later Hellenic era (600-300 BCE) - based as it was on empirical investigation and inductive reasoning - was a challenge to the older, tribal way of doing things. Previously custom ( nomos ) was the rule for behavior, and to follow custom was dike , the path of justice. Disregard of custom was hybris and was unacceptable and even dangerous beyond its immediate implications. As it became increasingly evident that social problems, such as the reform of Athenian laws by Draco and then Solon, could be solved by either an appeal to either relative practicality or absolute standards , a growing controversy arose concerning the relation of nomos to physis (nature or the divine order). Foremost of the absolutists was Pythagoras, who sought in number the beginning or arche of things - the ordering principle or “one behind the many”. The teachers of relativism were known as sophists . There were a great many of them in Periclean Athens, and they gave advice ranging from the practical to the quasi-legal [there were no lawyers per se ]. They performed an important function in the socialization of the community, but absolutist philosophers suspected the commercial motives behind their teaching, as well as their subordination of ideals to effectiveness. The most famous of the sophists was Protagoras (ca. 481-410 BCE), associated with the aphorism: “Man is the measure of all things.” Protagoras was a materialist, holding that the explanation of all things lay in matter, but he further argued that each person perceives and interprets matter according to different perspectives. Institutions are not a manifestation of physis ; they are conventions of human experience. Plato (387-347 BCE) [through the character of Socrates in his Dialogues ] considered the soul or psyche as the repository of the entire personality or character. One should not attempt to purify the psyche by rituals or restrictions, but rather to develop it through exercise of its faculties. The state is the psyche magnified, hence the Republic is most accurately seen as a prescription for the psyche magnified. Specifically there is a three-part similarity between state and soul: The state's populace, auxil iarie s, and guardians correspond to the soul's sensation, will, and reason. The respective virtues are temperance, courage, and - 122 -"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"wisdom. In the Republic Thrasymachus suggests that Justice is merely the interests of the stronger. Socrates responds that they may not know their interests. Glaucon then suggests that Justice is maximization of individual desires while avoiding suffering at others' hands. Socrates indirectly refutes this by prescribing the ideal state - the “Republic”. Hence Socrates answers Thrasymachus and Glaucon by arguing that it is more natural for a man to be just rather than unjust if his soul is healthy and each part is doing its proper work. It was important to Plato that virtue be raised to a level of rationality . It was not enough for people to be unconsciously or instinctively virtuous; they must “taste of the knowledge of good and evil” and then knowingly choose the good. Plato stratified thought as Eikasia (primitive emotion), Pistis (ordinary active/reactive thinking), Dianoia (precise, logical, enlightened thought), and Nœsis (intuition and apprehension of the Agathon ). 126 He offered the famous “parable of the cave”, whereby philosophers (who have seen the Agathon of perfect wisdom) lead mankind into the light by means of the dialectic . [Here “dialectic” means teaching or rather the encouraging of self-teaching through examination and refutation of imperfect concepts.] Plato was an elitist, but his elitism was directed towards an ideal, happy, and harmonious society, which he felt could best be attained by enlightened stratification of roles. His prescription was thus benevolent aristocracy. Critics of Plato erroneously attack him as a totalitarian oligarch. They are also bewildered by the “mysticism” which permeates his writings. Such “mysticism” is intelligible to those familiar with the Egyptian and Pythagorean metaphysics from which it derives. 126 In classical political thought there was a concern to locate authority beyond anything that anyone could appropriate, either in wisdom or in justice, or, as in the Platonic Agathon - the supreme Good which is beyond definition. The Agathon can accommodate as many formulations as there are human beings, and every person can make his own report. As there will always be a transcending or conceivable Good beyond the good(s) of particular individuals, the Agathon is ineffable and indefinable, and necessarily transcends the spatial and temporal limits of finite powers of perception. - Iyer, Raghavan N., ParaPolitics: Toward the City of Man .

Thus an externally-proclaimed, but intellectually-unintelligible [and unquestionable] morality governed humanity and its social institutions. This is the situation which persists today in the world’s surviving theocratic cultures and states, such as those of Islam and Israel. The cataclysm of the Protestant Reformation (1515-1648) and Catholic CounterReformation (1545-63) saw the effective elimination of theocratic political morality in Europe. It was replaced first by the Age of Absolutism (1500-1789), demarking the strongest secular monarchies, and then by the intellectual and militant revolutions of the Enlightenment (late 17th & 18th centuries). The Enlightenment proposed to replace secular monarchies with competing concepts of purely-human “social contracts” forcibly established (Thomas Hobbes) cooperatively negotiated (John Locke), or arising from public sentiment (Jean-Jacques Rousseau). The Lockean model was that adopted by the Founding Fathers of the United States, while in the much more cynical and harsh model of Hobbes were the seeds of modern utopian socialisms, as well as Marxian communism. Seen against this tableau, the infamous totalitarianisms of the 20th century - Italian fascism, German National Socialism, and the Marxist variations of Leninism and Maoism, were less authentic political designs than Romantic reactions against the perceived dullness and starkness of the social contract concept. Indeed by the end of that century all of the utilitarian social-contract models were exhausted, either by formal collapse (fascism, communism) or from popular disinterest and cynicism. 127 127 We were equally tired, in mid-century, of cold sanity and hot blasphemy; of the over-cerebral and of the over-fæcal; the way out lay somewhere else. Words had lost their power either for good or for evil; still hung, like a mist, over the reality of action, distorting, misleading, castrating; but at least since Hitler and Hiroshima they were seen to be a mist, a flimsy superstructure. - Nicholas Urfe, in John Fowles’ The Magus ( op.cit. ). - 124 -"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"What has gradually but inexorably replaced these ideologies is something even more impersonal and amoral: the technological society. Increasing automation and computerization of the means of production, communication, social services, finance, and military force have altered human leaders and decision-makers from ideologists to technicians. As such their effectiveness is measured not by their popularity or integrity, but rather by how well they further the technology in support of the people’s continuously-rising expectations. If such a super-technician leader fails to deliver those expectations, the consequence is initially the search for someone who promises to do so; and if this fails, explosive social instability. There is simply nothing else besides gratification to hold such a society together. 128 Which leads this discussion to its culminative point: that what is missing from modern society, and what is thus desperately needed for it to become productive, stable, and inspiring, is a popular morality of the very sort apparent at the beginning of ancient civilization . This is what is meant by ParaPolitics , and it is what the ParaPolitics Branch of the Army exists to identify, formulate, and activate in each MW situational instance. It is the necessary end of the MW campaign, the Agathon towards which every decision and action within it proceeds. C. ParaPolitics Architecture Construction of a morally-based polis first requires the discarding of the ideological remnants of the “social contract” era. As Dr. Raghavan Iyer observes: We are especially linked to the complacent nineteenth century and its tragic aftermath. Words became infected with the ideologies of political movements on behalf of classes, elites, ruling classes, empires, and nations; and as a result we have inherited a welter of “isms” - liberalism, socialism, communism, fascism, and their prolific bastard progeny. 128 This is a modern remanifestation of the “bread and circuses” atmosphere of imperial Rome, wherein the original, venerable Republican institutions had, if surviving at all, become mere sounding-boards for the emperor of the moment. The disintegration of any legislature from an active policy-making reflection of the constituent citizenry to a merely-symbolic facade for ulterior interests and motivations is an invariable harbinger of national eclipse. - 125 -"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"No “ism” is a logically-complete and self-consistent system of ideas. Its spurious claim to completeness converts it into an ideology which can win followers and reconcile them to losses and setbacks. An ideology is a form of imposition of holy writ by a putative expert on any doctrinal “ism”, whether he or she be the guardian of a party or a church, the head of a nation or a program, or any leader who engages in an inefficient form of bossism and resorts intermittently to force, treachery, and trickery to secure compliance. This collusion initially seems adequate but in time becomes hard-hearted and precarious, and must eventually end. Demoralization results from imposition by force or fraud in lieu of inducement through a consistent appeal to the unrestricted use of reason, to common experience, and to shared insights. 129 The problem of technology is at once simpler and more difficult to solve. Simply, it merely requires insistence that it remain subordinate to human values. The difficulty is that it is an alluring and addictive aphrodisiac for which a disillusioned, cynical populace is all too ready to sacrifice such values. 130 The solution to this dilemma, continues Iyer, is ParaPolitics : ParaPolitics signifies the imaginative application of seminal ideas vitalizing political theory and practice; the elaboration of fundamental principles into paradigms of relationships among persons and between civil means and human ends; the quest for political understanding and action based upon expanding self- awareness; and the ever-receding perspective of ideals rooted in the ethics, metaphysics, and psychology of self-transcendence. 131 129 Iyer, op.cit. , pages #11-12. 130 This tension was most dramatically illustrated in Thea von Harbou’s 1926 novel Metropolis , filmed 1927 by her husband Fritz Lang. The impasse between monstrous industrial machines and the dehumanized workers who served them was resolved only by Maria, a woman who awakened the desire for the Agathon in everyone - except the magician Rotwang, who sought to thwart her by creating a soulless double - the infamous robotrix Ultima Futura - to impersonate her. Like Kundry in Wagner’s Parsifal , however, Maria overcame this Doppelgänger to redeem humanity: “The mediator between brain and hands must be the heart.” 131 Iyer, op.cit. , page #27. - 126 -"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"This prescription is less formidable than it reads at first glance. Ordinary political interactions can be analytically dissected into six motivational expressions: perfectibility , reason , welfare , stability , power , and self-preservation . The politics of perfectibility are those inspired by the desire to improve the status quo , whatever it may be. Reason involves established processes of discussion and negotiation, resulting in progressive changes by both consensus and compromise. Welfare considerations are those reflected within the basic fairness and humanity of various policies and proposals. Stability of the embracing social system is a constant concern with regard to all potential modifications. The quest for individual and institutional power results from personal and group ambition, and self-preservation follows from people’s instinctive desire for security and continuation of their family line and community image. In an ideal situation all six factors would be in equilibrium. In practice, particularly in the current Age of Ideologies, this is rarely if ever the case. Distortion of the principle of perfectibility leads to outbursts of patriotic narcissism along with xenophobia. Exclusive or predominant reliance upon the reasoning procedures of established institutions excuses or ignores urgent social needs which have little or no voice in them. A popular demand for welfare can leave the community stripped of its vitality by penalizing personal initiative or privilege; at extremes it leads to revolution. In contrast, an excessive concern for stability results in repressive laws and their coercive enforcement. Power for its own sake - not from the runaway idealism of perfectibility - disintegrates a community into selfishness and cynicism. Self-preservation can become overactive in a state suffering from other distortions or disruptions, resulting in personal alienation from [what remains of] the community and anarchy. The MW diagnostic procedures of Phase 1 examine all six categories to identify both imbalances in a given area and their effect upon the entire structure. Part of the Phase 2 “cure” involves “rebalancing” that structure as efficiently and effectively as practical. That is not where the PPB’s work stops, however. It is not there just to secure a tenuous, utilitarian stability, but rather to continue into the identification and inspiration of a positive, inherently-reinforcing moral community: a true polis . ParaPolitics is the twin product of vision and virtu : the former being the benevolent and creative ideas which the stabilized - 127 -"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"environment makes possible, while the latter reflects the nurturing, careful pragmatism of Machiavelli. 132 Neither “means” nor “ends” can be used to excuse the other. ParaPolitics rather demands their identity . To Mahatma Gandhi this reflected the law of karma in politics. The end is satya (truth), which requires no justification. The means are ahimsa (non-violence). This approach presupposes that there is a transcendent morality ( Maat or the Agathon ) to which sincere, altruistic humans may aspire and attain. Throughout the quest for both vision and virtu PPB must be guided by three interlocking, mutually-supporting energies: will (the strength to bring the polis into being), logos (the conviction and determination to express it openly and honestly), and eros (deep and sincere sympathy for everyone affected by it). Such a ParaPolitics resolution can be applied to any specific situation in any culture, geographical area, economic level, or other identifier. This is because it is applied not towards forcibly altering any of these, but simply to reduce tensions and conflicts within them and to develop their positive contributions to the áristos . D. Evolution to ParaPolitics Branch If the “brain” of a MW campaign is MWB, and the “hands” MFB, PPB is what they both exist to engender and enhance: the “heart”. Once a subject group and/or area is identified as the object of a MW campaign, it is PPB which is activated to conceive, design, and nurture within it a polis of the highest individual and community morality: what Plato defined as kalokagathia. This is no easy task, as the alienation, inadequacy, inhumanity, and resultant instability of the subject group/area are the cumulative consequence of the centuries-old suppression of this principle by the procession of exploitive, utilitarian, and alienating sociopolitical systems summarized in #B above. Furthermore PPB must tailor every such polis to its unique environment and circumstances, which requires sensitivity to and respect for local nonpolitical cultural traditions (for instance religion and gender customs). 132 Cf.

It further reestablishes the defining principle of a morally- progressive community: that each educated 133 citizen is entitled to a personal formulation of relative truth, which is to be respected, not exploited or suppressed, by others. 133 In this context “education” means the unfolding among receptive individuals of the capacity to choose effectively, to set themselves their standards of excellence, to exemplify tolerance and civility in relation to others, to identify with achievements and failures of those near at hand and of persons everywhere, and to see life as a process of continuous self-education.

The Reality of PhysWar Utopian appeals for an end to war, whether by international organizations, statesmen, philosophers, or artists, are abundant, eloquent, and futile. The impulse to it is too strong and pervasive throughout all human cultures and affairs: a “natural state of war” most famously observed by Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679): There Is Alwayes Warre Of Every One Against Every One Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. For WARRE, consisteth not in Battell onely, or the act of fighting; but in a tract of time, wherein the Will to contend by Battell is sufficiently known: and therefore the notion of Time, is to be considered in the nature of Warre; as it is in the nature of - 133 -"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Weather.

The tensions, emotions, and drives remain; the physical destruction of the Earth, its resources, and its living beings does not. While in the future MW may become the initial war-mode, at this time of its introduction and phase-in, it must expect to run into situations already destabilized and torn by PhysWar. The MWarrior, no matter how well prepared, is not entering a rational environment where both [or multiple] sides are disposed to reason. In addition to PW inertia - the continuation and escalation of PW because of economics, politics, and emotions - participants tend to the conviction that all bridges are burned: that there is no alternative to victory or annihilation. As George Orwell observed in 1984 : War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should exist. 134 134 Orwell, George, “War is Peace”, 1984 .

Complicating this is that the issues in modern PWs are rarely only internal to the participant nations. More often they are resources or strategic accesses that either other nations or supranational economic institutions covet. Or it may be that the PW is the result of one or more participant nations experiencing an ideological, economic, and/or religious fragmentation. The MWarrior’s first task, therefore, is to identify and correlate all such destabilizing factors. Each element’s existence and significance should be stated in terms general enough to embrace its impact on the entire situation, such that its hypothetical absence would eliminate its influence. A second reason for this generality is that it facilitates the Phase 1 diagnoses process: The “building blocks” are kept big and simple, allowing diagnosis-combinations that are easy to visualize and assemble.

Paramilitary Operations Under the Guise of “Intelligence” “Intelligence” normally refers to the gathering and explaining of information about a problem-situation - including information which the participants don’t want known. The purpose of intelligence is simply to present decision-makers with a clear, accurate, and complete picture of the situation, so that any decisions they make are not in ignorance of critical factors. The atmosphere of secrecy in which intelligence collection efforts occur, however, has led to various agencies extending their activities into clandestine active measures such as paramilitary combat, kidnapping, and assassination. While the temptation to meddle in another nation’s internal affairs is understandable, such activities violate the principle of national sovereignty and destroy the intruder’s image as an open and honest international participant. “Intelligence” must be limited to intelligence. 2. Emotion-Arousing Violence While the term “terrorism” has been overused to mean merely any individual or group resisting any participant-nation’s government control, its original meaning was the employment of “terror” (e.g. intimidating or violent actions designed to frighten both recipients and witnesses into silence and cooperation). [The term “state terrorism” identifies similar behavior by established governments.] A campaign of terror is meant to convince the recipients that the government cannot or will not protect them, while on the other hand failure to cooperate with the terrorists will result in punishment or death. As the government and/or any occupying forces cannot know where such terrorists will strike next, they cannot be defeated in the conventional sense. Rather they must be neutralized by removing their motivation, be it religious, ideological, ethnic, etc. This is a task for strategic MWB applications. A key element of terror is its indiscrimination. It injures or kills persons not just directly, but also randomly and incidentally.

History is replete with examples, exposed or still clouded in deception and suspicion. While obvious effective in producing the immediately-desired effect, false-flags are, ethically, despicable and shameful. Such actions must be absolutely rejected as a policy option, and when discovered exposed and punished without excuse, evasion, or equivocation. 4.

Population Repression Governmental limitation or removal of civil liberties and rights on the grounds that this is necessary to “fight terrorism” does nothing to deter terrorists (who will not respect any such limitations), but it will both aggravate the populace towards the scapegoat and discourage protest against the PW-promotion.

There is no middle-ground between these alternatives. C. MindWar Integrity A MW campaign cannot succeed if “the house be divided against itself”. PW pressures, both overt and covert, over which the United States and other participants have control, must be arrested before a MW solution can be initiated. Otherwise the MW campaign will be assumed to be a sham: a mere show-distraction from the actual PW agenda. Indeed it is the suspension of all PW-pressures, albeit temporarily and provisionally, which gives the MW campaign its initial dignity and credibility. PW-habitués may deride the rigorously-idealistic taboos above as naïve, wishful thinking in today’s harsh world of routine callousness and cruelty. “Nice guys”, they will insist, “finish last.” Nevertheless if humanity is to be brought back from the brink of self-annihilation, it can only be by a conviction of honesty, empathy, and humanitarianism so resolute that all such cynicism shatters before it. Nowhere is this better argued than by Albert Camus in a letter to a German friend while serving in the French Resistance during World War II: You never believed in the meaning of this world, and you therefore deduced the idea that everything was equivalent and that good and evil could be defined according to one’s wishes. You supposed that in the absence of any human or divine code the only values were those of the animal world - in other words, violence and cunning. Hence you concluded that man was negligible and that his soul could be killed, that in the maddest of histories the only pursuit for the - 139 -"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"individual was the adventure of power and his only morality, the realism of conquests. And, to tell the truth, I, believing I thought as you did, saw no valid argument to answer you except a fierce love of justice which, after all, seemed to me as unreasonable as the most sudden passion. Where lay the difference? Simply that you readily accepted despair and I never yielded to it. Simply that you saw the injustice of our condition to the point of being willing to add to it, whereas it seemed to me that man must exalt justice in order to fight against eternal injustice, create happiness in order to protest against the universe of unhappiness. Because you turned your despair into intoxication, because you freed yourself from it by making a principle of it, you were willing to destroy man’s works and to fight him in order to add to his basic misery. Meanwhile, refusing to accept that despair and that tortured world, I merely wanted men to rediscover their solidarity in order to wage war against their revolting fate. As you can see, from the same principles we derived quite different codes. Because you were tired of fighting heaven, you chose injustice and sided with the gods. I, on the contrary, chose justice in order to remain faithful to the world. I continue to believe that this world has no ultimate meaning. But I know that something in it has a meaning, and that is man, because he is the only creature to insist on having one. This world has at least the truth of man, and our task is to provide its justifications against fate itself. And it has no justification but man; hence he must be saved if we want to save the idea we have of life. With your scornful smile you will ask me: What do you mean by saving man? And with all my being I shout to you that I mean not mutilating him and yet giving a chance to the justice that man alone can conceive. 135 Hence such “clearing of the field” is not as fanciful as it might seem. It is clearly in the interests of all participants to avoid the death and destruction of PW, and MW is the most methodical and practical means for realizing this. If one or more participants refuse to halt their PW efforts, the MW Command (MWC) assembled to assess and activate the MW campaign may decline to proceed further. The situation then reverts to previous PW-oriented authorities and agendæ. 135 Albert Camus, 4th Letter to a German Friend, July 1944. Camus (1913- 1960) was a French philosopher who received the 1957 Nobel Prize for Literature “for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness, illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times”. - 140 -"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"This acceptance or rejection of MW capability also highlights the limitations of a MW apparatus constructed solely within the U.S. Army. Ideally MW should emanate as policy from the highest levels of government, with the Army’s MWC finding the diplomatic and pre-PW field already cleared for it when a situation is designated. Instead this experimental Army component must anticipate “Phase 0”, in which it must discover and attempt to bring to a halt ongoing PW pressures. Within the MW structure this is principally a task for the MFB, since it possesses both the mobility to examine the subject area and the versatility to avoid dangerous confrontations while doing so. Phase 0 concludes when MFB reports its findings to the MWC, which then makes the decision either to proceed to Phase 1 or to reject the MW assignment. Given the abundance and strength of pre-PW forces resisting MW, is MW worth pursuing? The answer to this must be sought in the innate character of mankind. If de Sade correctly asserted the human race to be motivated by and committed to its self-destruction, then, as Hobbes predicted, we are condemned to a future which is “nasty, brutish, and short”. But if, as Abraham Lincoln believed, there are “better angels of our nature” whom we may summon to inspire our compassion for and behavior towards one another, then MW is not naïve idealism but an eminently worthwhile and achievable virtue.

Redefinition of the Problem MW Phase 1 is the redefinition of an assigned conflict in terms of an acceptable and practical outcome. The U.S. armed forces are not accustomed to foreign involvements leading to anything less than complete destruction of the assigned enemy. A MW campaign begins with the elasticity of outcome: a solution which is the best possible under the circumstances ( áristos ), though it may not completely satisfy any participant in the conflict. The áristos may well justify medals, but probably not triumphal parades. The nascent PW halted in Phase ø is characterized not only by its covert mischief but also by its official misrepresentation, if not outright denial. Attacks and invasions take place under monikers of “peacekeeping”, “stabilization”, or “assistance”, either U.S.-unilaterally or under the umbrella of the United Nations, NATO, or “coalitions”. This evasive labeling fools no one, but adds to the general confusion in that neither actors nor goals are openly and clearly acknowledged. And since they aren’t, no one knows what the PW goal is, how to determine whether it’s reached, or even who would make such a determination. - 143 -"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"B. Declaration of MindWar MW begins with a formal declaration of MindWar, which includes a definition of the problem and identification of its participants, as well as a proposal for [collective] victory ( áristos ). Ideally this should happen in the Congress, per a formal declaration under the Constitution’s Article I §8, although in a post-World War II era of unending PW actions both overt and covert, Congress has largely abandoned this responsibility to the Presidency. The introduction of MW gives Congress an excellent opportunity to reassert its authority, since MW is a humanitarian solution unlikely to generate the domestic political emotions and pressures caused by PW actions. Quite the contrary, the citizenry is likely to stand predominantly, if not unanimously behind such an forthright approach to an international problem. Another benefit of a formal MW declaration is that it signals to the situation-country or its internal conflicting groups that the United States as an entity is committed to a MW solution; it is not a “house divided” in which an ostensible MW campaign may be undermined by a continuing covert PW one. It also informs such participants what general solution the United States has in mind, so that they can begin to discuss its effectiveness and acceptability among themselves. The PW alternative, obviously, promises only indeterminate death and destruction. Assuming, however, that it will take some time [and some evidence of less-formal MW successes] before Congress is emboldened to this formal extent, U.S. Army MW itself must define its MW mission and sell it progressively to the Army, the Defense Department, and other concerned governmental departments and agencies. This is rather less daunting than it sounds, since such external governmental entities are generally willing to “give MW enough rope” as long as they are not responsible for a failed campaign. MW, as previously discussed, is completely prepared for the possibility of failure, although, like Bruce Lee, it regards obstacles as incentives to rechart the path to the áristos . “You can get there from here.” C. Diagnosis of the “Disease” The symptom of PW is military or guerrilla action by or within a situation-location. There can be many reasons for such eruption of violence, and often several simultaneously: livelihood hardship, fear of - 144 -"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"harm [whether from the government, invading/occupying forces, or guerrillas], anger from experienced harm, religious fanaticism, individual or sectarian political ambition, territorial greed, and/or involuntary impressment. What might initially startle conventional intelligence officers and strategic planners is that the MW diagnostic procedures below are conducted unclassified and completely in the open. It is essential to the accuracy of all the steps, as well as to the final Foundation Diagnosis (FD), that as many of the individuals, groups, and organizations included in the diagnostic sweep be aware of it and have the opportunity to both critique and contribute to it. This reflects the MW principle that a successful MW campaign must be waged by all participants against inertial PW pressures, and that the only true MW victory is a collective one. 1. Internal Diagnosis Before evaluating a U.S. MW response to a specific situation, the MW strategist must identify all contributing irritants - in the absence of any U.S. interference whatever - and create a profile of the situation- location accordingly. It would be convenient if such irritants could be given neat, numerical weights and plotted on a mathematical matrix, but this is impossible due to their fundamental dissimilarities. What is possible is to rank them in rough order of their influence; for instance in one country religion may be the dominant aggravation, while in another only a minor consideration. Internal national policies, customs, or issues, such as race, nonnational ethnic groups, gender status, civil rights, which may indirectly bear upon PW brinksmanship, must also be identified and ranked. 136 136 PW has always been sold to people in grandiose absolutes: the freeing of an oppressed country, vengeance for a claimed outrage, the establishment of democracy, etc. MW, on the other hand, limits its objectives, and its claims, to the possible and the practical, which may be significantly short of the ideal, as well as more difficult to explain. In short, at its best MW is not emotionally satisfying. - 145 -"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Such a gradient is completed for each participant group. Then the groups with their rankings are placed side-by-side in a lineup to compare motivations and their relative influence. Similarities in strong influences suggest what a MW campaign must emphasize in order to succeed - if the situation-location exists in complete isolation, which in most situations it does not. 2. External Diagnosis The next step of diagnosis is to similarly identify and rank all external influences bearing upon the impending or aborted PW in which the situation-location is engaged either internally or externally. This must be done for each foreign country whose policies or actions contribute to the PW momentum, as well as for involved non-national organizations or enterprises. Again a ranked lineup is created, and a weighted picture generated. At this level of analysis, care must also be taken to identify whether specific foreign countries’ interests are aligned or antagonistic to one another. In short, the situation-location may actually be an artificial proxy for a much larger, indirect contest. During the Cold War many “wars of national liberation” were regarded by the capitalist and communist blocs as showcase tests of their worldwide power and prestige. Such views were not necessarily shared by the local client regimes or movements. Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh, for example, was first and foremost an anticolonialist who admired and cited the American Declaration of Independence. Only when he perceived American support for the post-World War II restoration of French colonialism did he turn to the Soviet Union and China, allies with whom his regime maintained an uneasy and mistrustful relationship, exploding eventually into Vietnam’s 1979 war with China. An obvious danger here is unconscious analytical bias in favor of the United States and/or its favored international clients; or against countries, blocs, or non-national groups or influences perceived or imagined to be hostile to the U.S. Diagnosis must be objective and dispassionate if it is to be accurate. During later MW Phases applicable biases and agendæ can and should be acknowledged and faced, but never in Phase 1. - 146 -"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"3. Composite Diagnosis Once both internal and external lineups have been completed, they are combined into a composite, whereupon overall common factors are identified and ranked. While this stage of analysis may begin with a simple diagram, it cannot end there, because this is the stage at which MW situation-location population analysis comes into play. Strategic research & analysis teams from all three MW branches must consult towards an áristos path which not only participant leaders but the affected populace may agreeably and realistically tread. 4. Analysis Expertise Formal area- and country-studies abound within the various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, as do published books, periodicals, and running commentaries in the commercial media and Internet. For a MW diagnosis the R&A teams must cast their net as widely as possible, again taking care not to exclude or discount facts or points of view which the United States might find politically, economically, or emotionally inconvenient or repugnant. 137 5. Foundation Diagnosis Finally the MW R&A teams produce a comprehensive diagnosis, which, once articulated, will be the foundation of the consequent MW campaign. This Foundation Diagnosis (FD) is the source to which all operational elements of the campaign - MWB, MFB, and PPB - will constantly refer to ensure the coordination and success of the campaign. It is a dynamic, continuously-updated resource, not a static document. 138 137 The Schrödinger’s Cat problem: There is inherent difficulty in a national analysis being performed objectively from within the nation itself, because its traditions, norms, beliefs and taboos tend to be taken for granted and hence unrealized as relevant, significant factors - and thus not to be considered changeable ones. 138 The name of this culminate, operational diagnosis pays tribute to Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series of science-fiction novels, in which two Foundations were established to minimize galactic social decay and disintegration through psychohistorical analysis and counteractive measures. - 147 -"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"D. Prescription of the “Cure”: The Áristos The FD, if correctly done, presents the present profile of the situation-location and provides indices which can be used for short, medium, or long-range forecasts as well. Any one of a number of social, political, and economic forecasting techniques can be applied to the FD, but these will only indicate the situation-location’s future if the present destabilizing influences which have caused the PW environment are left unchanged. 139 It is the purpose of a MW campaign to change them in such a way as to eliminate the threat of PW and ensure a stable, constructive, and endurable environment. The word “peace” is intentionally not used, because it may be necessary to continue the formal state of MW significantly past the initial elimination of violence into correction of the imbalances which could otherwise lead to its return. Formal MW victory is declared when the situation-location can be left to function completely without it. 1. The MW Campaign Goal: the Áristos From the FD MWB strategists develop a goal for the MW campaign. This goal represents the most practical, quick, and universally- endurable changes which can be made to the FD in order to alter its profile to one of non-PW stability. Thus this goal is called the áristos , the ancient Greek term signifying “the best for a given situation”. 140 139 A comprehensive and readable survey of political, social, & economic forecasting theory and techniques is Futuring: The Exploration of the Future by Edward Cornish (Bethesda: World Future Society, 2004). Cornish, who Edits The Futurist magazine for the WFS, has constantly revised and updated this primer at least since I first discovered it in 1977 [as The Study of the Future ]. MWarriors, after initial orientation at the JFK Center and graduate studies in magic at the Magic Castle and in kung fu at the Shaolin Monastery, may further expand their professional acumen through WFS curricula. 140 The concept of the áristos may be studied in numerous contexts and applications in John Fowles’ The Áristos (Boston: Little, Brown & Company, 1964). - 148 -"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The áristos is not ready-made; it does not present itself from the FD, because the FD is merely a profile of the unaltered situation and a means to forecast from it. The áristos is an intrusion into the FD inertia, an adjustment of it to alter it. If the FD is done correctly, it will not be easy to alter it in a manner which does not risk unexpected ripple-effects, some of which could engender new instabilities. For this reason the correct áristos will be one which stabilizes the problem-situation with minimum disruption of the FD. 2. Flexibility of the Weighted Ranked Factors The diagnostic process produced ranked diagnostic factors which combined with analytical expertise led to the fusion of the FD. The next step towards the development of the áristos is to evaluate each factor in terms of how quickly and easily [if at all] it may be changed. Once the quickest & easiest possible adjustments are identified, the question becomes which combination of these would suffice to stabilize the problem-situation most easily, practically, and economically. 3. Open Access Evaluation In PW opposing sides plan their strategies in secret, seeking to surprise, deceive, and disadvantage one another. Since each side is necessarily working with an incomplete and distorted picture of the situation, intelligence (the attempted acquisition of information an opponent wishes to conceal) is essential, inevitably with incomplete and imperfect results. The consequence is a PW campaign of misunderstandings, mistakes, blunders, and excesses: the sum-total of which does not, indeed cannot lead to a rational resolution of the conflict. In MW the process leading to the FD is not only not classified, but is advertised and open to all conflict participants. The “enemy” is the PW-conducive situation, not any individual or group caught up in it. While the FD is initiated, developed, assembled, formatted, and disseminated by assigned U.S. Army MW strategic R&A teams, access to and suggestions regarding their deliberations are actively, constantly sought and welcomed. Situation participants not only have the most direct and convenient access through electronic media, but are invited to visit the strategic MWC headquarters to meet and dialogue with the MW planners themselves. - 149 -"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The result is a FD as complete and undistorted as possible, and an emerging áristos which is neither a surprise nor an emotional confrontation to anyone involved. If a less-than-ideal solution were sprung as a surprise by only one side in a conflict, the odds for its acceptance would be reduced by the opponent’s pride and resentment of a “dictated ultimatum”. If, as in MW, everyone takes both the credit and the blame for a tolerable if imperfect áristos , such emotional coloring is minimized, possibly completely avoided. 4. Acceptance of the Áristos Before the MW campaign can be activated on the basis of the FD and its emergent áristos , all situation participants must agree that it is acceptable. This is of course much easier if they have all been involved in the process from which it emerges, in that they were thus able to propose and evaluate alternative solutions. Planning participants, however, are not the only ones who must agree to the áristos . Each must present it to superiors, subordinates, and general adherents, and secure their endorsement and cooperation. This will usually be tentative and reluctant, because that is the nature of an áristos . As the MW campaign proceeds, acceptance of the áristos should solidify. If it begins to dissolve, it is a sign that the áristos was wrongly formulated and needs redefinition. - 150 -"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Chapter 8: Phase 2 In the province of connected minds, what the network believes to be true is true or becomes true within certain limits to be found experientially and experimentally.

The problem-situation cannot, of course, be relied upon to remain static while the MW campaign’s incremental changes are being applied. As each change occurs, the FD must be updated accordingly, along with the reverse-engineered [and now presumably shorter] path to the áristos .

If the “map” is constructed correctly, its success will be inevitable, because it is based not only on physical situations and conditions, but on the mechanism of the minds of all humans involved . It is this latter feature of the MW campaign which distinguishes it from a conventional “reallocation of resources” analysis, such as is both commonplace and useless in international disputes. In MW the psychology of all participants is the missing key which not only makes the campaign possible but makes its outcome inevitable. A. Task Organization and Composition Phase 2 requires a major reconceptualization of the old U.S. Army MISO unit design and functionality. In the old MISO configuration, which was designed for PW battlefield-janitor support, the only strategic units were two Active Army MISO groups (MISOGs) located at Fort Bragg, NC under a single MISO command (MISOC). The USAR units scattered around the United States consisted of tactical elements only, suitable for deployment in support of committed PW operations. 141 Within the MISOC, responsibility for strategic MISO research & analysis rested with a Cultural Intelligence Element (CIE) which, since it was limited to a few 2-year-contracted civilians who are all deployable overseas, could not possibly attract either the extensive experience, all- source information collection, or academic discipline expertise essential 141 The two USAR MISO Groups (the 2nd & 7th) were proposed to be brought into the MISOC in Fiscal Year 2013, with their missions revised as well. - 152 -"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"to MW. 142 Under MW configuration, strategic research & analysis responsibility is a USAR function. Strategic MWB groups (MWBGs) are assigned general geographic areas of responsibility. To monitor these in time of peace, and perform MW diagnoses in times of developing conflict, these MWBGs create a varying number of specialized MWB diagnostic teams (MWBTs), located near government departments/ agencies, universities, and private-sector research institutions specializing on the geographic areas in question. These MWBTs are fixed/non-deployable, and are composed of both highly-specialized and -credentialed USAR soldiers and contract civilians. When a MW campaign is formally declared, the MWBG with that geographic focus is responsible for producing its Foundation Diagnosis (FD) and updating it throughout the campaign until victory is declared in Phase 4. This MWBG has tasking authority directly to the MetaForce teams (MFTs) already in the situation-location, requiring them to both provide on-site feedback for the FD and also to identify and secure the participation of key actors within the conflict. In order to do this efficiently, tactical MWBTs (which are the function of the Active Army MWBGs) are deployed with the MFTs. Their specific mission is to raise the MW diagnosis to its most accurate level, and to both guide and facilitate the MFTs in their actions enhancing the MW campaign. The mission of the MWB and its MWBTs is to establish a mental environment making the success of the MFTs inexorable and inevitable. Nothing is left to chance. Before any MFT proceeds with MW Phase 3, its path must be cleared of all mental obstacles to its success. 142 “The Cultural Intelligence Element (CIE), formerly known as the Strategic Studies Detachment, is an organic part of the MISOC that provides in-depth analyses of cultural, social, political, and historical factors affecting MISO as well as lethal and nonlethal operations. The CIE offer doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.)-level subject-matter expertise and advice on mission planning, impacts, and ramifications to supported commanders, U.S. COMs, and deployed MISO forces.

MW units are all team-modular, so appropriate teams can be instantly reassigned to create a task-focused unit. The level of the created unit depends upon the complexity of its component of the FD. B. Time and Space Parameters Before the áristos can be reverse-engineered, its implementation must be defined in terms of both time and space. These terms have a substantially different meaning and significance in MW than they do in PW: 1. Time In the old PW universe, “time” was merely a clocking of the expenditure of assets towards the subjugation of humans labeled as enemies, and the annihilation or occupation of their lands and livelihoods. This clock began with D-Day and ended with V-Day; or rather it was then eventually reset to the next decided D-Day. For the MWarrior, however, “time” is not a clocking device, but rather a problem-identifying and -defining one. It is “time”, indeed, which more than any other single factor, generates, sustains, and concludes modern human conflicts. The reason for this is that today’s human beings are motivated to action not by an “endless present” but by their vision, expectation, and promise of the future. This is a relatively recent development. The ancient Egyptians, for instance, sought perfection in stability, harmony, symmetry, geometry, and a cyclical [as opposed to a progressive or linear] concept of time. A similar interpretation of time characterized the Maya, the Greeks, and China. Later the Hebrews and Christians introduced a linear concept, containing both a beginning and an end to time. The consequence of this was to demand of mankind a “mission”: a mandatory, desperate march towards that end. 143 143 Cf. G.J. Whitrow, The Nature of Time . New York: Oxford University Press, 1972. - 154 -"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Originally such a linear enslavement of humanity was thought to be dictated by God, with posthumous reward or punishment awaiting each Jew, Christian, or Muslim in accordance with his obedience and accomplishment. With the onset of the Enlightenment in the 17th/18th centuries C.E., literal belief in God and eschatology faded into metaphor, but the concept of linear progress persisted. Now, however, the impetus was towards a human-created utopian society in this life; and various “social contract” ideologies to attain it - such as socialism, capitalism, fascism, and communism - competed for popular emotional endorsement and commitment. What has changed with the end of the 20th century is what might be called “the death of Hope”. Neither God nor man is believed any longer as a creator of Paradise, either here or hereafter, so what has superseded both is a worldwide culture of temporal gratification: wealth, power, prestige, and glamor. The only “immortality” is to successfully make one’s mark in history: to manage to write “Kilroy Was Here” on the Great Mandala of history as it sweeps through and past one’s brief lifetime. 144 The significance of this to MW is that while the United States and similar “postmodern” cultures mock time in this hedonistic danse macabre , many enclaves of the world experiencing social disruption still exist in the old utopian, or even-older metaphysical time-contexts. If the MWarrior does not recognize and address this, he will completely misunderstand the perceptions and motivations of the subject-locale inhabitants. During the Cold War, Western strategists thought to defeat communists with promises of capitalist affluence, failing to understand that Marxism sees such [class-characteristic] luxuries as merely superficial diversions from a universal utopia. In the 21st century the same stimulus-strategists find themselves mystified by the intensity of Muslim fanaticism, failing once again to understand that this is their sincere vision of the perfect future - just as modern Israel, no less than its ancient model, sees its political future not as negotiated by men, but as commanded by YHVH. 144 With inexorable appreciation to Peter, Paul, and Mary for “The Great Mandala (The Wheel of Life)” (Peter Yarrow, Pepamar Music Corp., 1967). - 155 -"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"When visualizing a MW campaign, therefore, it must be in both the time-context and the time-expectations of the subject populace and its leadership. This may range from a Western-imitative contempt for time, to fierce fundamentalist eschatology: a passionate conviction that the End of All is imminent. Once the governing time-parameter has been ascertained, it can be manipulated to serve the áristos by seizing control of its own defining mechanisms. If an ideology, reinterpret its implementation - as Lenin did when he revised Marxism into his “dictatorship of the proletariat”. If a resurgent religious fundamentalism, advance a vision of even greater intensity, purity, and redemption to coopt it - as first Christianity and later Islam did with Judaism, and as Protestantism would also do with medieval Catholicism. The blind fury of such passion is by no means limited to modern Islam. After 1550 tensions between Catholics and Protestants had reached the stage of religious warfare, culminating in the terrible Thirty Years’ War between Denmark, Sweden, and the Protestant German principalities on one hand and the Catholic Hapsburgs (Spain, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, and most of Catholic Germany) on the other. France, though Catholic, fought against the Hapsburgs for secular political reasons. Approximately one-third of Germany's population died from the war and its side-effects, and its final fadeout was brought about more by exhaustion than by genuine reconciliation. The common feature of all the linear-time doctrines, whether supernatural or secular, is their promise of Paradise. They offer the Hope which disillusioned, sybaritic modernity has abandoned. The MWarrior should not - indeed cannot - kill this Hope. Quite the contrary: Like Pandora in the ancient Greek legend, he should safeguard and nurture it as one of the strongest of MW assets. 145 145 Pandora was the first human woman, created by the gods of Mount Olympus and entrusted with a jar which she was warned never to open. Eventually her curiosity overcame her and she violated the prohibition, releasing all of the evils of the world to afflict humanity forevermore. But also in the jar the gods had placed Hope, who made it possible to endure and survive those evils. The Greeks would have considered the modern “death of Hope” as a dark omen indeed. - 156 -"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"2. Space What dimensions does the áristos embrace in terms of national geography, dispersion of ethnic groups, livelihood resources? Here a balance must be struck: If the expanses are too large, MW resources will not be able to support them. If they are too small, attainment of the áristos will be overwhelmed by uncontrolled exterior influences and forces. What is presently referred to as the “nation-state system” came into being gradually and incrementally in European history, but is generally assumed to have stabilized into its modern semblance with the Treaty of Westphalia (1648). While “nation” identifies an ethnic or cultural group, “state” identifies a sovereign geographic area. The combined entity has since been assumed to have international legitimacy and recognition as a “unit” of global humanity. Complicating this, of course, have been many inconvenient historical developments, such as rising ethnic identities across state borders, religious movements, nonstate ideologies (such as socialism and communism), and most recently transnational capitalist economic enterprise. While the nation-state system still clings to many traditions of sovereignty, such as war, taxation, and internal law, it is clearly a concept in inexorable, if not yet terminal disintegration. Its evolutionary successor will most likely be some form of corporate plutocracy, with the old countries lingering merely as human-control mechanisms for internal policing and external warmaking. The United States, as the world’s sole surviving superstate, has by default become the defender and enforcer of the nation-state concept, while simultaneously, by virtue of the multinational economic entities it has engendered, it is ironically also its psychopomp. Appropriately the United States’ official enemies in the 21st century are no longer other nation-states, but nonstate individuals and groups who disregard or threaten that idol of legitimacy and sovereignty. Such individuals and groups are currently called “terrorists”. 146 146 If an established, internationally-recognized nation-state develops an uncooperative or inconvenient government, it may be propagandistically denied legitimacy as a “rogue state”, whereupon it is acceptable to force “regime change” upon it. - 157 -"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The dilemma of the 21st-century environment, obviously, is that the United States’ announced policy of “non-negotiation with terrorists” constricts it to only one course of action: their PW extermination. In a world in which non-nation-state groups are rapidly and massively proliferating, while the 17th-century state structures are fighting a commensurately-desperate and Quixotic battle to cling to their old Weltanschauung , this is a naïve and ultimately futile intransigence. The MWarrior must not only be willing to negotiate with anyone ; he must actively initiate and facilitate such dialogue. As the identities and positions of those with whom he interacts may not [and probably won’t] be nation-state credentialed, the operative concept of the physical entity at issue will change as well to accurately encompass the problem. It is this problem which MWB and MFB must reidentify as the common enemy to be conquered by all human participants. C. Reverse-Engineering the Áristos Once the time and space parameters for the áristos have been defined, the material and psychological requirements for its attainment are addressed: 1. Material Requirements When conflict arises over the ownership, control, and use of resources, there are two general solutions: reallocation of the existing supply and/or addition to that supply, eliminating or lessening the need for reallocation. The former is more possible within a sovereign nation- state; the primary problem is the willingness of owning/controlling interests to reduce their share and the amount of such reduction necessary to satisfy the demands of the populace. Complicating this question is the modern fluidity of both variables: Both resources and people are constantly moving in and out of the situation environment. What is needed, therefore, is not an arrangement of fixed quantities, but rather a formula which will move along with both variables. Such formulas since the Enlightenment have generally aligned into the ideologies of capitalism (private ownership) and socialism (government ownership), with communism (collective ownership) and anarchism (no ownership) being extreme if unsustainable alternatives. - 158 -"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Capitalism’s attraction is that it stimulates efficiency through competition and opportunism. Socialism removes the motive of personal greed and gratification, replacing it with overall common security. Human beings nevertheless continue to desire and seek advantage over one another, and in socialistic systems this takes the form of bureaucratic competition and aggrandizement. “Capitalism is the exploitation of man by man,” it is said, “while socialism is the reverse.” Social-contract ideology, accordingly, is not an answer to resources tension. What is needed is an atmosphere of altruism within whatever the ideological framework happens to be. This is not an economic or a resource commitment, but an emotional one: the kalokagathia of the morally-based polis . It is the task of MWB to incline the mental dispositions of all participants towards this emotion through appropriate combinations of the PSYCONs detailed in Chapter 3, the concurrent task of MFB to encourage all involved individuals and groups to manifest this good will in concrete, constructive expression of the áristos , and the task of PPB to develop and communicate a vision of community perfection beyond the immediate áristos which will enthuse, energize, and sustain the new moral polis . The inculcation of leader and popular enthusiasm towards a visionary goal is nothing new in history; it characterizes everything from football games to national revolutions. The common feature of such ordinary expressions, however, is their vagueness and lack of substance. Once the initial burst of passionate ecstasy dissipates, the old alienations and selfish divisions reassert themselves. Only the labels [if even that] are different. The reverse-engineering from the áristos stability to the present instability is governed by the simple principle of need. What is most essential to all affected individuals’ survival and safety is what is prioritized, from initial emergency relief at present to a gradually more affordable and sustainable minimum. Care must be taken not to overrun this minimum, otherwise expectations will promptly rise to the excess; and if that excess is not sustainable, fresh tensions will result. Once critical material needs have been identified and prioritized, supplementary ones are added as availability and practicality permit. Along with subsistence, people desire comfort, pleasure, and dignity. Much of this can be improved modestly and incrementally. As long as attention and improvement are seen and experienced, the populace will not be in as much of a hurry for it as for survival and safety essentials. - 159 -"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"2. Psychological Requirements In a successful MW campaign it is not just what changes are reverse- engineered to take place, but how they are explained, how affected individuals and groups feel welcome and empowered to respond to and influence them, and ultimately what contribution they make to the complete cooperative and moral climate of the emerging polis . Psychological reverse-engineering also follows the principle of need. In a present-moment condition of physical privation and danger, ideological and egotistical concerns are extraneous; what matters is to save lives, alleviate fear, and eliminate hunger and disease. The mechanisms for accomplishing these are not reserved to either capitalism or socialism, though their exercise under each may differ in organization and image. Only when all vital needs have been met and stabilized is it time for the character of the future polis to be addressed. In the previous PW environment this was a tediously-familiar cabaret: the cliché harangues of capitalist/socialist platitudes. In MW it is irrelevant which model nominally triumphs; the essential determinant is which one best facilitates the development of the polis . As one experienced adjuster of international tensions observed: Of course patriotism comes along and makes it seem fairly all right, but this “my country right or wrong” business is getting a little out of date. Today we are fighting communism. Okay.

Recalling the PhysWar/MindWar Contrast MindWar Phase 3: Attack is where the entire complex of MW comes together. Everything done previously leads to and integrates at this point, and everything subsequent to it is dependent upon its successful design, coordination, and execution. A summary of the characteristics of PW vs. MW emphasizes the value of the latter: 1. PhysWar (PW): • results from the stumbling-into a foreign conflict situation by the United States rather than a discretionary involvement. • is first preceded by civilian diplomacy which has no clear goal in sight nor strategy to achieve that goal. • is next preceded by non-DOD paramilitary operations, and/or economic and/or cybernetic damage, none of which has a clear goal in sight or strategy to achieve it. - 163 -"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"• is thus the escalation-result of the failure of these two precedent actions, indeed their probable aggravation of the situation. • consists of the application of lethal and destructive combat force against any appearance of resistance, without concern for the justice of that resistance. • has no clear goal in sight nor strategy to achieve it. Continued force is simply applied until all resistance ceases, or until disconnected civilian interactions negotiate a suspension. • utilizes the three old Special Operations Forces - MISO, Special Forces, and Civil Affairs - as battlefield janitors to improve the destructive efficiency of the combat forces and deal with the human and property devastation left in their wake. • takes an increasingly-larger toll in human injury and death, flight for survival, and enduring hatreds resulting from these. • diverts massive and increasing amounts of U.S. financial and materiel assets from domestic needs. • prolongs and aggravates, rather than solves the original problem. 2. MindWar (MW): • commences as a deliberate, discretionary decision by the United States in concert with all of the participants in the existing problem situation to declare MW against that problem [not one another]. • is preceded by civilian diplomacy aware of a Foundation Diagnosis (FD) developed by MWB, working in concert with MFB towards a stabilizing áristos , and planning in concert with PPB for an enduring moral polis elimination of the underlying causes of the problem situation. • in the event of diplomatic failure, commences a military- exclusive MW campaign utilizing the three Special Operations Forces - MWB, MFB, and PPB - as the initial, exclusive - 164 -"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"projections of U.S. power. All PW forces are kept unengaged, for possible recourse only in the event of MW failure. •• MWB’s function is to develop the FD and to precondition all participants in the conflict to a mental attitude of calm, reasonable, and constructive cooperation throughout the presence of both MFB and PPB in the situation area. •• MFB’s function is to deploy to the situation area, identify and secure the cooperation of all key individuals and group parties to the conflict, and establish the áristos with sufficient stability for handoff to PPB. •• PPB’s function is to commence planning for the configuration and implementation of an enduring moral polis solution to the underlying destabilizing conditions upon their identification by the FD, then to deploy to the situation area and implement that polis solution upon áristos stabilization of the area by MFB. • kills or injures no one, and destroys nothing. • expends only the normal operating funds for the MWB, MFB, and PPB units involved and deployed. • Solves not only the immediate problem but, through creation of the polis , potential future ones as well. • Is declared, again by all participants, to formally end once the polis is established and PPB withdraws. B. MW Command (MWC) Location The MW campaign is controlled from an encapsulated facility, either contracted or if necessary constructed for this purpose. If the problem situation is confined to a single nation-state, the MWC should be located within it unless the existing destabilization is so great as to pose danger to it. In that case the MWC should be located in a nearby country perceived by all participants as neutral. - 165 -"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The “encapsulation” is from an environmental, not a privileged- access standpoint. The contracted or constructed facility should permit MWB to implement and continue a completely-controlled PSYCON atmosphere, such that anyone within it is subjected to every possible calming, cooperative, optimistic, and creative stimulus; and shielded from all possible negative, disruptive, exhaustive, and stress-inducing ones. The entire complex is, for instance, bathed in alpha BWR and complementary magnetic fields. Its air-conditioning is negatively- ionized. The color red appears nowhere, while the color blue predominates. Sharp, angular lines and objects are eliminated or minimized, and all interior spaces and furnishings are arranged to remain beyond CD but within PSD proxemics [as calculated from the culture(s) of the situation participants], etc. This PSYCON preconditioning is neither cosmetic nor trivial: It is a precisely-constructed conditioning of the mental processes of all within the MWC to enhance their chances for cooperative success in the campaign. Additionally, while none of these MWB controls is clandestine, they should all be as inconspicuous as possible, so that awareness of or curiosity concerning them does not divert participants’ attention from the campaign at hand. C. MWC Participation In Phase 0 the MFB begins the process of identifying all participant individuals and groups to the conflict. This identification is refined during Phases 1 & 2 to single out the most essential political leaders, [para]military commanders, and other key participants (such as religious figures and economic executives). By the end of Phase 2 this is narrowed down to the smallest number necessary and essential to consensus concerning and establishment of the áristos . These individuals are then invited to the MWC, where together with the United States they will assume control of the campaign. Within the MWC the United States presence - consisting initially of MFB and then of PPB - remains at all times advisory, on the principle that disputing parties must ultimately resolve and reconcile their own distances and disagreements. Nevertheless this U.S. advisory function is completely and continuously active, not passive. Initially the MW- combative skills of MFB may be called into play to dispel initial suspicions and tensions which resist the MWB environmental - 166 -"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"conditioning; these flow into MFB’s negotiation function. As a fully cooperative participant climate emerges, MFB fades imperceptibly away from the MWC to be replaced by PPB. The agenda shifts from the immediate áristos stabilization to the permanent moral polis construction. D. MWC Integrity Success of the MWC, and thus of the entire MW campaign, requires that its actions be open, transparent, and at all times publicly explainable. While U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies may [and doubtless will] pay careful attention to what the MWC discusses, decides, and implements, such agencies are not themselves MWC participants. They are, however, all welcome and encouraged to make their information concerning the problem situation available to all of the participants. E. The On-Site Environment While the MWC participants are working towards the áristos and polis realizations, MWB extends the PSYCON atmosphere within the MWC facility to the entire situation area as fully as technology and opportunity permit. This may include use of all EMS media impacting the area to transmit alpha BWR, or in extreme instances of violence, delta BWR. Negative atmospheric ionization may be enhanced by various weather-control measures such as cloud-seeding. Locales identified as especially susceptible to outbreaks of violence may be measured for disruptive EMFs, and any such detected violence neutralized by either eliminating the source (as in nearby power-lines or unshielded EM-generators) or counterbalanced by directed EMFs. Obviously PSYCONs extend only so far into a situation of human unrest. Where physical privations of nourishment, safety, health, and cultural lifestyle exist, MFB teams work with all available local, national, nongovernmental organization (NGO), and United States assets to cooperate towards the áristos stabilization. - 167 -"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"F. MWC/On-Site Communication MWC participants must at all times know what is happening in the situation area, not only so that they may refine their efforts accordingly, but also because as key leaders and determinants of the social forces in motion they will be reluctant to distance themselves from these forces unless assured that their control and influence are not being severed. Similarly the situation-local entities and groups must retain a sense of involvement with their leaders, so that their MWC-absence does not result in factionalism or spontaneous disruptions. G. MWC Transition to On-Site The purpose of setting up the MWC is to enable swift, efficient actions towards the FD-established áristos by all essential participants in an environment PSYCON-engineered for maximum cooperation. While the MWC facility is also used for initial discussion and planning of the subsequent moral polis under the guidance of PPB, the implementation of this polis must necessarily occur on-site. Thus as soon as there is basic consensus concerning the nature and structure of the polis , which may be markedly different from the existing, haphazard political and social mechanisms, participants return to their original locales to continue the implementation. They are accompanied by appropriately-specialized PPB teams [at this stage MFB’s task is done, and it vanishes as magically as Miss Poppins], while MWB continues its conditioning of the entire subject area until the polis is securely established and all PPB teams return home. When all participants have departed the MWC, it remains open only as a point of coordination between the on-site PPB teams and the situation-locational MWB environmental conditioning. As soon as these cease, the MWC is closed, and the MW campaign comes to an end in Phase 4. - 168 -"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Chapter 10: Phase 4 [In response to “Conan, what is best in life?”] “To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of the women!” - Arnold Schwarzenegger, after Genghis Khan (1162?-1227) The only victories which leave no regret are those which are gained over ignorance. - Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) A.

Where the United States’ MW forces are concerned, their victory is also invisible. All three of them appear, function, then disappear “between the raindrops” - particularly MWB, whose mental manipulations are significantly subconscious. What MW participants see is ostensibly a U.S.-hosted conference in which a constructive compromise, previously elusive, “somehow” materializes to everyone’s adequate, if not complete satisfaction. At the conference’s conclusion, the parties return home to a “coincidentally” less-violent situation than the one they left a short time earlier, inspired by a number of new options for revitalizing their precarious social structures. - 169 -"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"B. Time and Space 1. Time As per Chapter 8.B., MW solutions to current disputes must be oriented to the cyclical or linear timeframes of those affected. If their perception is linear, the solution will be seen as merely temporary; if cyclical, as applicable indefinitely. In one conspicuous example, Israel visualizes a divinely- commanded linear mandate to its Holy Land, and will be unsatisfied until the entirety is [re]claimed. Palestinians, regarding their inhabited lands as timelessly theirs, neither understand nor accept Israel’s inexorable schedule. Because of this time disengagement, attempts to arrange compromises between them are impossible. Only when all parties to an áristos understand and accept it in the same time-context will it not self-destruct. Even when immediate participants are synchronous, external or non-nation/state influences may not be. In the Mideast, for instance, Western-linear governments have found themselves confronted by Islamic movements which are unmoved by the asserted time-legitimized sovereignty of present regimes; what matters to them is the timeless propriety of their religious faith. A MW solution to such situations will have to stand the test of religious as well as secular expectations. Absent coinciding time-arrangements, an apparently-successful MW campaign cannot expect a final, “textbook” victory. Instead a decision will have to be made to either prolong the campaign indefinitely, which, due to the energy required of all three MW branches, would be prohibitive; or acknowledging failure and standing aside for PW. Realistically the only way to avoid this would be for the asynchronous participants to accept a harmonious, if not exactly identical timeframework. Historical precedents for this are not encouraging, though western European Christianity [after centuries of violent discord] managed something like it in the face of widespread Enlightenment disaffection with Catholicism and the various Protestantisms alike. Linear Marxism, on the other hand, failed to adapt to the greater pressure of cyclical supranational capitalism, and finally disintegrated under it. - 170 -"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"2. Space As also per Chapter 8.B., the nation/state model of sovereignty persists in some parts of the globe while abruptly or gradually disintegrating in others. Signed agreements and idealistic polis -models mean little if the human sand beneath them flows away in unrelated directions, into unanticipated new configurations. These variables are many: tribal, religious, linguistic, racial, economic, sexual, ideological, supposedly-extinct national identity, and possibly multinational-corporate. Nor is only one of these “unconventional” forces at work within various conflict situations, particularly in the more volatile areas of the world. Within a MW campaign, Phase 3 must identify and include as participants representatives or leaders from any such influential “irregularities” together with the accustomed nation/state officials. This won’t make arriving at the FD or its implied áristos any easier, but it will make them realistic in implementation. C. Bigger Ponds, Bigger Fish By design a MW campaign addresses the most compact situation which lends itself to reasonable isolation. The larger the scope, the more numerous and complex the variables, until the totality becomes unmanageable as well as unsolvable. The problem of such intentional limitation, of course, is that those larger ponds, with larger fish swimming in them, are still out there. At any point, whether incidentally or intentionally, one or more of them may impact and possibly overwhelm the more compact MW campaign scenario. Predictably a balance must be struck. The campaign is continued at its manageable level, but a cautious eye stays alert for external surprises. Some of these, such as international financial cycles, can be taken into account as necessary without much extra effort. Others, such as major PW outbreaks, serious disease pandemics, coups, assassinations, nuclear accidents, major weather-disasters, are wild cards which cannot be anticipated. Any can temporarily or permanently disable an otherwise on-track MW campaign. Just as possibly the factors pertinent to that campaign may be unaffected by a calamity which captures widespread public and media attention. - 171 -"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"D.

The medieval-era emphasis on logic and metaphysics gave way to revived Classical learning in areas such as language, literature, history, and ethics. The Renaissance began in Italy due to its strong ties with Classical knowledge, and due to the comparative wealth of the major Italian cities. From 1450 to 1600 a Neoplatonic movement backed by one of the Florentine Medicis gained considerable influence. Plato’s works were translated into Latin by 1469. It was such a climate in Florence that spawned Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527), whose pragmatic ideas were to so infuriate the pseudo- pious and hypocritical officials of his time that “Old Nick” would eventually become a pseudonym for the Devil himself. In actuality Machiavelli never advocated evil or depravity; he was a champion of the good and the virtuous. His “evil” reputation came about simply because he pricked the balloons of so many of the predatory and pretentious. Machiavelli's political philosophy may be summed up thus: Any means, however lawless or unscrupulous, may be justifiably employed by a ruler in order to establish and maintain a strong central government. The founder(s) of a society must be excused for acts which are inexcusable after the society has been established. The grounds for this initial license are simply the forceful, initial establishment of good qualities and benefits of the resultant society. Examples of such unprincipled founders in The Prince are Moses, Romulus, and Cyrus - each of whom attacked and destroyed rivals in order to found the important state in question. - 172 -"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"This license was not venial, however. What Machiavelli saw about him was a chaotic world of callous indifference to human privation and suffering, which he characterized as fortuna . In his famous commentary The Prince he held that it was incumbent upon wise rulers to recognize both appropriate solutions ( necessita ) to fortuna and the most effective timing for their implementation ( occasione ). Properly done, this would result in a general state of well-being ( ordini ), which is the practical aim of politics, guided by the ancient Roman tradition of civic virtue ( civitas ). The key to the achievement of these ends is virtu : the ability to think intelligently and act resolutely. Machiavelli never proposed that “ends justify means”. The correct quote from The Prince #XVIII reads: “Moreover, in the actions of all men, and most of all of Princes, where there is no tribunal to which we can appeal, we look to results. Wherefore if a Prince succeeds in establishing and maintaining his authority, the means will always be judged honorable and be approved by every one. For the vulgar are always taken by appearances and by results, and the world is made up of the vulgar, the few only finding room when the many have no longer ground to stand on.” Machiavelli saw all political history as an interplay between fortuna and virtu . When virtu is held by the many, republics are possible. When virtu is held by the few, tyrannies result. To understand the governing principles of political life, one must examine the beginnings of significant political systems. It is the beginning that sets the pattern for a political situation; successive rulers are relative imitations reflecting that beginning. This is the basis for Machiavelli's being called the first political scientist , since he sought an explanation of a state in what it is and has been rather than in its future goals or ideals. It is for this reason that the construction of the moral polis , as discussed in Chapter 5, is critical to the successful outcome of a MW campaign. A veneer of virtu cannot compensate for, nor long survive in a community lacking civitas . Machiavelli may be considered the first political philosopher to base his philosophy solely upon “natural” [as opposed to divinely-inspired] mankind. The “Divine Law” component of Aquinas’ four-part, legal universe was irrelevant to his perceptions and prescriptions. In his Summa Theologica St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-74) described the ordering of the universe by four types of law: Eternal , the mind of, hence intelligible only to God; Natural , which is Eternal Law to the - 173 -"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"extent that human reason can detect consistencies in it (e.g. “science”); Divine as revealed through Christ and the Christian church; and Human, which mankind makes in imitation of and towards the “good” perceived in/revealed by Natural and Divine Law. Machiavelli contended that since Divine Law is beyond the comprehension of human reason, it cannot and should not be asserted as justification for social systems. Politics, he argued, belongs wholly to the realm of reason, and should be evaluated on that basis alone. “For the manner in which men live is so different from the way in which they ought to live that he who leaves the common course for that which he ought to follow will find that it leads him to ruin rather than to safety.” This focus on achievable practicality (the áristos ) ultimately encourages man to attain dignity by taking complete responsibility for himself. In thus relegating religion to something metaphorical and optional rather than literal and mandatory in human affairs, Machiavelli followed the lead of William of Ockham (1288-1348) [of later “Occam’s razor” fame], who stressed belief in God as a function of pure faith rather than reason, and anticipated the deism of the Enlightenment several centuries later. Thus Machiavelli, like Plato and Aristotle, sought the áristos . Unlike them he limited it to reason and to mankind in its natural state. And he excused all incidental excesses in a state only if an ultimate, common good could thereby be more quickly and thoroughly attained. What this book proposes is to evolve the rationality of Niccolò Machiavelli to the present century: to argue that virtu exists in the soul and will of humanity if, as Camus warned, it is not crushed before it can respond to fortuna , recapture the civitas of the original moral polis , and establish ordini . 148 Unlike Machiavelli, we possess the means to undertake this true Quest for the Grail without resort to the sword.

Consulting Neuropsychiatrist Washington, D.C. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this remarkable manuscript. It represents a “tour of the horizon” of problems of the information environment as they relate to national security affairs. MindWar is an innovative, trenchant, and courageous work. Sun Tzu, often quoted, but seldom seriously studied, reminds us that the supreme pinnacle of the art of war is to win without fighting, or to persuade the enemy of your superior perspective, such that he would wish to join you. This is the goal of MindWar: to make the wisdom of Sun Tzu operational. In the current political environment, this will not be an easy task. We are asked to presuppose that our leadership be as enlightened as philosopher-kings, or, failing that, at least not beset by the gang of knaves and buffoons who now provide our daily distraction. To place such power as MindWar contemplates in the hands of such men is a fearful idea. Thus the underlying premise is to work toward the creation of an environment wherein we become better people. This is a worthy goal, and has been a project which began with Plato. The history of Western philosophy has addressed this conflict. Is human nature immutable, causing us to be destined to antagonism and collective mayhem? Or is it possible that this nature is sufficiently malleable, given wise counsel and leadership, to move away from that destiny. The history of the 20th century does not inspire confidence that we can do that. But this dichotomy will be debated until the eschaton.

After a year with the 1/17th Cavalry, 82nd Airborne Division, he completed the PSYOP Officer Course at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School, in which he was among select students cross-trained with the concurrent Special Forces Officer Course. During 1969-70 he was assigned to the 6th PSYOP Battalion, 4th Group, Vietnam. As an HA Command & Control Team Leader, he was responsible for both tactical (HB) teams in combat operations, and audio-visual (HE) teams in the Civil Operations & Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) program, and flew numerous PSYOP air support missions throughout III Corps Tactical Zone with both the U.S. Air Force and Army aviation. - 203 -"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"In 1972 he joined the 306th PSYOP Battalion (Strategic), USAR at Fort MacArthur, California, and for the next seven years served as Research & Analysis (FA) Team Leader, Operations Officer, and finally Executive Officer. In the 306th - whose members ranged from eccentric Hollywood personalities to dour L.A.P.D. officers - he oversaw highly-classified Basic PSYOP Studies for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, PSYOP support for the training of units such as the 12th Special Forces, and use of the 306th’s atmospheric World War II-era bunkers for space combat scenes in the original Battlestar Galactica television series. In 1976 he was selected for the Foreign Area Officer career program, completed that qualification at the Special Warfare Center and Central Intelligence Agency during the next three years, and participated in NATO REFORGER exercises as a Western Europe specialist. In 1976 he also completed the remaining course requirements for Special Forces, and was awarded that Tab upon its creation in 1984. From 1979 to 1981 he served as the FA Team Leader for Headquarters, 7th PSYOP Group in San Francisco, during which time he and the Group Commander collaborated on the predecessor concept paper to this MindWar book. Returning to active duty in 1981, he was transferred to Civil Affairs Branch, completed its Advanced Course at the Special Warfare Center as the Distinguished Graduate, and received the rare Primary Skill identifier of Politico-Military Affairs Officer (48G). In this capacity he was sent to the State Department Foreign Service Institute and the Defense Intelligence Agency for Attaché qualification, completed the Military Intelligence Officer Advanced Course at Fort Huachuca, and in 1986 was reassigned to Military Intelligence Branch. In 1986-7 he was the sole USAR officer selected to attend the Industrial College of the National Defense University. During that year he worked with the U.S. Information Agency representative at the National War College on the PSYOP Ethics paper which is also a predecessor to this book. In 1990 as one of the Army’s first officers to be certified in Joint Space Intelligence by the U.S. Air Force, he was assigned to J2 HQ U.S. Space Command, where in Section X, out of the Cheyenne Mountain NORAD complex, he was involved with those files until he retired from the Active USAR in 1994. Since the Army had waited until the exact date of his final USA retirement 2006 to create the PSYOP Branch, it graciously transferred him “posthumously” to the Green & Grey in 2011. He has retained his original affiliation with the 1st Special Forces Re giment out of respect for that unique honor. American decorations include the Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal, three Army Commendation Medals, two Army Reserve Achievement Medals, Parachutist Badge, Special Forces Tab, and USAF Space & Missile Badge. Vietnamese decorations include the Gallantry Cross, Psychological Warfare Medal, and Air Service Medal. - 204 -"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Academically he received the Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California in 1980 and the M.P.A. in National Resource Management from George Washington University in 1987.

Professionally he is a member of the Special Forces, PSYOP, Civil Affairs, Former Intelligence Officers, and Air/Space/Missile Defense Associations. After the conclusion of his U.S. government service, the Constitution permitted him to be recognized by Scotland’s Lord Lyon King of Arms as the current Baron of Rachane, Argyllshire.
