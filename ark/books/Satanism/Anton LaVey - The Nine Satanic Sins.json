[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Nine Satanic Sins by Anton S zandor LaVey © 1987 1. Stupidity— The top of the list for Satanic Sins. The Cardina l Sin of Satanism. It’s too bad that stupidity isn’ t painful. Ignor ance is one thing, but our soc iety thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on people going along with wha tever they are told. The media promote s a cultiva ted stupidity as a postur e that is not only acceptable but lauda ble. Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be stupid. 2. Pretentiousness— Empty postur ing can be most irritating and isn’ t applying the cardina l rules of Lesser Ma gic. On equa l footing with stupidity for wha t keeps the mone y in circulation these days. Eve ryone ’s made to feel like a big shot, whe ther they can come up with the goods or not. 3. Solipsism— Can be very dange rous for Satanists. Projecting your reactions, response s and sensibilitie s onto some one who is proba bly far less attune d than you are. It is the mista ke of expe cting people to give you the same conside ration, cour tesy and respect that you naturally give them. The y won’ t. Inste ad, Satanists must strive to apply the dictum of “Do unto othe rs as they do unto you. ” It’s wor k for most of us and requir es consta nt vigila nce lest you slip into a comf ortable illusion of everyone being like you. As has been said, certain utopia s would be ideal in a nation of philosophe rs, but unf ortuna tely (or perhaps fortuna tely, from a Ma chiavellian standpoint) we are far from that point. 4. Self-deceit— It’s in the “Nine Satanic Statements” but deserves to be repeated here. Anothe r cardina l sin. We must not pay homa ge to any of the sacred cows presented to us, including the roles we are expe cted to play our selves. The only time self-deceit should be entered into is whe n it’s fun, and with awareness. But then, it’s not self-deceit! 5. Herd Conformity— Tha t’s obvious from a Satanic stance. It’s all right to conf orm to a person’ s wishe s, if it ultima tely benefits you. But only fools follow along with the herd, letting an impe rsona l entity dictate to you. The key is to choose a master wise ly inste ad of being ensla ved by the whims of the many. 6. Lack of Perspective— Aga in, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and wha t you are, and wha t a threat you can be, by your very existe nce. We are making histor y right now,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"every day. Alwa ys keep the wide r histor ical and soc ial picture in mind. Tha t is an impor tant key to both Lesser and Greater Ma gic. See the patterns and fit things toge ther as you want the pieces to fall into place. Do not be swa yed by herd constr aints—know that you are wor king on anothe r level entir ely from the rest of the wor ld. 7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies— Be aware that this is one of the keys to brainwa shing people into accepting some thing new and different, whe n in reality it’s some thing that was onc e wide ly accepted but is now presented in a new package. We are expe cted to rave about the genius of the creator and forget the origina l. This makes for a disposa ble soc iety. 8. Counterproductive Pride— Tha t first wor d is impor tant. Pride is great up to the point you begin to throw out the baby with the bathwa ter. The rule of Satanism is: if it wor ks for you, great. When it stops wor king for you, whe n you’ ve painte d your self into a corner and the only way out is to say, I’m sorry, I made a mista ke, I wish we could compr omise some how, then do it. 9. Lack of Aesthetics— This is the physic al applic ation of the Balance Factor. Aesthe tics is impor tant in Lesser Ma gic and should be cultiva ted. It is obvious that no one can colle ct any mone y off classic al standa rds of beauty and form most of the time so they are disc our aged in a consume r soc iety, but an eye for beauty, for balance, is an essentia l Satanic tool and must be applie d for greatest magical effective ness. It’s not wha t’s suppose d to be pleasing—it’ s wha t is. Aesthe tics is a persona l thing, reflective of one ’s own nature, but there are unive rsally pleasing and harmonious conf igur ations that should not be denied."}]
