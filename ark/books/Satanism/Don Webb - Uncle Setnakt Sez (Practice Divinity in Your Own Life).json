[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Practice Divinity in Your Own Life Don Webb Uncle Setnakt would like you to consider how you are already practicing divinity in your own life. The Right Hand Path says your life is ruled by a mechanical law, called karma or the will of god. We feel that your life is ruled by a mechanical law called the path of least resistance and that law can be overcome by conscious beings. This work helps you detect how you have already overcome this law and how much there still is to discover and integrate into your mind. 1. Analyze an intentional change you've made. Take something you did with awareness and desire (as opposed to some adaptation that circumstances forced you to make). Say for example a decision to move to a new home, because the new home offered you opportunities for privacy. See how you have prospered by obtaining your goals in a rational manner. Now analyze the same event looking for supra-rational benefits you have gained -- good things (and opportunities for growth) that have come into your life directly from your willed decision, but which in no way could be predicted as logically following. Analyze enough of your life and you will discover that when you have put these things into motion with your will you have exceeded mechanical chance. Concentrate these feelings of power in your life -- link the incidents one to another in your mind. 2. Analyze a moment of pure creativity. Take something you've made for no utilitarian reason. Doodles drawn while on the phone are excellent. Why did you enjoy making this pattern? Why is there happiness at creation? The joy of creation makes little if any biological sense, but makes a great deal of sense if we discover our being through our creativity. This is directly opposed to the, \"No graven images.\" commandment. Become aware of how important it is to be a Creator. 3. Make note of those things that become self-sustaining. Note when any suggestion you've made becomes policy seemingly against the odds. I'm not talking about something you brought about in a normal work-a-day fashion, but those ideas of yours that came into being on their own. For example you casually suggest a change in the way your cleaners handle their merchandise tracking. Although they tell you that they can't do wha t you say; next time you return your policy is in place. Each of these incidents shows that you have powers beyond the mechanical processes of the world. Note each and come to see yourself as a creator of movement in the world."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"4. Pray to yourSelf. Look through your life to find some prayers that were answered by the Right Hand Path god of your choice. Maybe one day you prayed for your car to start, or for health to return, or to get luck on a date. As well as you possibly can remember the words and practices. Then when you are in the same situation repeat that prayer -- except entirely to yourSelf, making references to no god but you. Continue this practice until you have results. Come to see yourself as the cause for all seeming miracles in your life. It is you, the self created god, not some divinely appointed destiny. 5. Encourage the worship of yourself by others. Now don't be a prig about it like IHVH -- don't insist on no gods but me -- etc. Certainly don't be a jealous god, you can help others in their self deification. Be sure you have a nice birthday party, that others have chance to praise you when you do well etc. Then when you've created a little friend and fan club, begin to practice the simple Lesser Black Magic of telling the story that people who do good things for you have good things happen to them (and the converse -- eventually these people's unconscious Greater Black Magic will make this a condition of the world). Continue this practice at least until you can discover that some good has come your way because some one you do not know (directly) has been told you're a worthy individual by some one else you do not know directly. This will show that your presence is equal in force to any mankind's created gods â€“ that faith in you is strong to create a missionary movement. Of course this should be done secretly and subtly. If you outwardly proclaim your godhood crucifixion can result. Christianity may be understood as one self deified individual letting his practices get out of hand. Jesus is an example of a Black Magician without ethics. 6. Practice your godhood among your followers. When one of your fans is in trouble, magically use the Power of your Name to help him. Not out of pity or compassion but to Understand the nature of the name of a divine being. Once again keep this practice to yourself. Do this until you have results. This illustrates the power of the Word of Moses IHVH in which a fan club or political/cultural organization can create laws beyond the natural, an identity, and a bargaining position with the unknown by use of a Name. This not only produces an objective change in the world as an example of your own divinity, it will begin to illustrate the power of the word to open new potentials of power within you. This practice is highly recommended for someone who wishes to use words to explore himSelf/herSelf through such means as the Enochian Aethyrs. Be sure you have results here first. 7. Mythologize your birth in the manner of Christ, Buddha, Zoroaster etc. Learn to see your physical birth as the manifestation of the divine. You may wish to use a number of different masks in this. See yourself as a tribal hero returned, a god incarnated, or a visitor from another world. Play with these mythologies -- remembering to discard them once they've awakened in you the true knowledge"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that you are beyond the circumstances of flesh and history. Seek out the facts of your birth to feed your mythology with facts, create a mental list of all the historical things that had to happen in order for you to be born.; For example in Uncle Setnakt's case the Irish potato famine and the temporary existence of an ice bridge. These stories will allow you to work upon yourSelf and the world from the same basis as the aforementioned magi, but it will keep you from losing yourself to any mythology not of your creation (or recreation). 8. Create other beings. One of the signs of godhood is the ability to create other beings. Look through traditional magic systems concerning such creations -- whether the Judaic Golems or the Tibetan tulpa -- create an entity to accomplish a certain task and then return itself to you and offer itself up as sacrifice to your godhead. Watch without otherwise interfering in this task is accomplished and when it is await the return of the created one. You'll discover that you can create self willed entities and eventually you may wish to create and not absorb them. This will prove that you have all the powers of a god, and will direct your creations toward the cause of human freedom rather than any short term purposes. And even then you will birth a few monsters. 9. After you've become aware of your godhood announce it to all the worlds within and without. Perform a ritual after your fashion in which the message is, \"I abrogate all rituals except those I create. There is no magic done in any galaxy save that it empowers me -- this is the law of the only true god! I am the measure of beauty, there is no beauty except through me. I am the Truth, I am the Way, I am the Life. There are no gods before me, there is no power equal to my desire. I have always existed and by the power of my Name I am come to full awareness. All the universe is destroyed and re-created bearing the mark of what is newly of me. Naught exists save to teach me, to please me, and to give me a cutting edge to my own Becoming. The dead gods of mankind arise to do me homage and I blow them away like dust when their play called history has offered all it can to me. Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
