[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"What is a Satanic Ritual? I have been asked this question many times over. \"Can you send me a Satanic Ritual to ... Sign a Pact with the Devil...Make my ex-lover die...Make me blah, blah, blah...?\" This is the starting point of a Satanic Ritual; Desire. Let me start by defining Ritual. According to the dictionary Ritual is an action performed in a prescribed manner. You get up in the morning, put on the coffee, shower, dry-off, put your clothes on, drink your coffee, etc. A ritual could be anything from how you wash your car to how you summon energy to perform acts of Magick. In order to accomplish anything you must do it in a certain order. You don't start by adding the wax to your car before you have washed it, therefore you must first design the proper order of your Magick Ritual before you can perform it. So what then is a Satanic Ritual and how does it differ than that of any other ritual? The truth be known, it's not that different than any other ritual in another religions. The only difference is that you are aligning yourself with the dark side of your personality in order to get the full potential of the ritual. Many white-light religions feel that desiring something for personal gain is wrong. This is not true for the Satanist. When one realizes there is a dark side to themselves, one begins to understand themselves better. For example, when I realized and accepted I was a homosexual, I was able appreciate life better. When you identify that you have desires, you can enrich your life first by knowing what they are and then setting goals to obtain them. Anton LaVey in his Satanic Bible classifies Satanic Ritual into three categories: Sex Compassion Destruction The Sex Ritual is performed when you desire a persons affections that will eventually land them in your bed. You desire to be the object of someone's desires. From another perspective this could be called a Love or Charm Spell. The Compassion Ritual can be done for either yourself or another. It is performed with when you desire happiness, health, material or status success. Many rituals performed fall into this category."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The third ritual, Destruction is for exactly what it says, to Destroy that which gets in your way. This can be done out of anger, revenge, or just plain hate. Many people misunderstand a Destruction Ritual. It is not a \"green light\" to go out and cause harm or murder someone, it is a ritual performed to push away that \"extra psychological baggage\" you are burdening yourself with. If a person happens to \"coincidentally\" fall under mishap, all the better that it is not traceable to you. A Satanist is responsible for their actions. Get rid of the energy, not the body. Look at these three Satanic Ritual types; you will not find any right-hand religion condoning them. God forbid that you are human and have human needs and emotions. Humans are selfish beings and once you understand this, the better off you will be. Why do you think a Satanist is feared by so many? Because they do what they desire and not cower before a false God. I have been asked what are my opinions on the Witchcraft Three-fold law; where a spell comes back at you three times the strength you send forth. The three-fold law is based on guilt. If you feel guilty about performing a Destruction Ritual on an individual, you did not do your homework. When performing Satanic Ritual, you better be sure that you don't care about the outcome or demise of your intended victim or it will come back to haunt you through guilt. A Satanist takes responsibility for their actions. Last October I performed a Destruction Ritual on an individual that was to say the least; a Psychic Vampire and a whole lot more. I wanted nothing more to do with this person. I set up the Ritual, performed it, and forgot about it for several months. Then one day I asked around as I had not heard from this person. I found out neither had anyone else. For all I know, they are lying dead rotting in the ground. Do I care? No. That is why I performed the Ritual in the first place is to get rid of that person in my life. I don't care how it happened. \"What is the Magick incantation that makes this all happen?\" Be sure to write this down exactly as you see it. *AND* it is VERY important that you pronounce it correctly.

If not, you need to practice saying it correctly. Until you do, there is no Magick happening tonight. HELLO??????..... Ok, Let's get back to the real world. Anyone who tells you that a ritual HAS to be performed in a given fashion, or with special words as noted above is a charlatan. I want to show you to the basics of performing ritual. Now I have described the ritual categories, the next question is, How do I perform the Ritual? Dr. LaVey lays out an incredible outline for the conduct of the Satanic Ritual in the Satanic Bible. The keyword here is OUTLINE. I will come back to this in a moment. In order to make a ritual work, you must first be motivated. If you are not motivated do not start till"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"you are. Motivation requires that you have enough energy stored in you to make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. Motivation requires that you have done your part in preparing for the ritual. Think back to being young again. Children have the strongest Magickal powers than that of Adults. Why? Because Adults have lost the power to imagine. From Imagination comes real power. Imagination can create motivation. Use your imagination for motivation for creating your ritual. As I mentioned a moment ago, the Satanic Bible presents an outline for the ritual. Satanic Ritual does not require that you perform the task in a given pattern. There are no demons out there with clip- boards in hand checking off a list of requirements wheiter to assist you or not. Some ask me, \"I did it as prescribed in the Satanic Bible and nothing happened, WHY? Is it because I did something out of sequence or said something wrong?\". This is NOT why the ritual didn't work. It didn't work because of something else you did not do. Magick is not something that you do like baking a cake. Cakes don't come out right because you got the ingredients, temperature or time wrong. Magick works on its own level and what works for one may not work for another. Sometimes Magick works later than expected. The Ritual room is not the only place where the magick of the ritual is performed. It is an ongoing process that I will end this essay with. The important part to understand is that Satanic Ritual has no set patterns. You can set it up however you like. NOTHING IS SET IN STONE and No ONE can dictate your ritual except you. To begin the development of your ritual, you must first ask yourself why do you want to perform this? This will help you find your motivation. Think of it as a psychological look at your self in a mirror. There is something burning down deep inside you that you want. Wishing your desires to come to you is not going to make it happen. Why do you think so many Christians fail in their prayer for what they are asking? In order to get this energy out of you and to successfully perform your Satanic Ritual, you have to let go this energy. This means get the thought out of your head so the deed can be accomplished. The next step is to decide which category (sex, compassion, or destruction) it falls under. Do you want someone, something, or to be rid of someone? Then decide how you want to cast out this energy. This is where your creativity comes into play. By writing it down or burning a candle are a couple of examples. Remember, you are in control here. Make it exciting. Psychodrama is only here for you, not anyone else or to please some demon. I have a room specifically set up for my rituals. In it I have the Sigil of Baphomet on the West wall. After I have dressed for the ritual in my black robe and silver Baphomet, I light black candles to illuminate the room. I use enough black candles only for proper lighting. I use one white candle to represent the hypocrisy of the Christian church. After I have created the circle, I begin my spell. I take my athame (ceremonial knife) and call forth the demons of each compass point. Facing the Baphomet I start the ritual by pointing the athame at the Baphomet and say; \"In the name of Satan, the Ruler of the earth, the King of the world, I command the forces of Darkness to bestow their Infernal power upon me! Open wide the gates of Hell and come forth from the abyss to greet me as your brother and friend! Grant me the indulgences of which I speak! I have taken thy name as a part of myself! I live as the beasts of the field, rejoicing in the fleshly life! I favor the just and curse the rotten! By all the Gods of the Pit, I command that these things of which I speak shall come to pass! Come forth and answer to your names by manifesting my desires..\" Starting with the West I call forth Leviathan, ruler of the West by drawing an inverted pentagram in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the air in front of me. Rotating counter-clockwise to the south, I repeat the Call commanding Satan, Ruler of the South to appear. Then to Lucifer from the East and finally to the North ruled by Belial. I then proceed to manifest my desires either on paper, candle or article that represents my intentions. You can use anything you want for this part of the ritual. Some of my spells are done with parchment (a special paper for the ritual) or a special candle (I find Black candles are the most effective) designed for the type of ritual I'm performing. You can use anything you want for this part of the ritual. Some use dolls, dressed in possessions of their intended target (an article of clothing, jewelry, or hair). I write my spell on the parchment or candle, I envision myself transferring it to the object of my writing. When I am finished, I then call forth a demon and instruct them to carry these instructions away from me so that I need not to spend anymore energy thinking about it anymore. After this is done I add my sigil to the image and then burn it to carry the message away. While it is burning, I can feel the energy of the message being delivered into the etherium. During the sacrifice, you can recite one of the Enochian Keys listed at the end of the Satanic Bible if you feel it will enhance your ritual. Each key is listed there in Enochian (a 15th century language) and in English. You can recite either version. Again it does not matter if you know Enochian or not. There is no one here grading you on your grammar. Your primary concern during the ritual is to evoke that energy in you, anger, desire or lust and use it to its fullest impact during the creation and sacrifice. You will know that your ritual was conducted properly if that energy you used is no longer with you. In this you know that you have successfully cast out that energy and transferred it to another realm. To close the ritual, I then thank the demons for joining me and let them go. In reverse order starting in the North and working counterclockwise to the West. I will again trace the inverted pentagram in the air saying; \"Thank you Belial, Ruler of the earth for assisting me, you may go. Thank you Lucifer, ruler of the air for assisting me, you may go. Thank you Satan, ruler of fire, for assisting me, you may go. Thank you Leviathan, ruler of the water for assisting me, you may go. With this I point the Athame above my head and call out HAIL SATAN! Later I write the events of the ritual in my grimoire. I will talk about my feelings, occurrences, time of the day it was performed and if need be the phase of the moon at the time of my ritual. This is useful for later when you obtain the result or not of your workings, you will know how to or not to repeat the same sequence of events. However, the ritual does not end here... The act of taking your desire and placing it outside of the confines of your mind is the first step in making it happen. You have just empowered yourself to accomplish anything you desire. Magick cannot work all on its own. After you have finished your ritual, you must act upon it. For that Sex Ritual, you need to contact the object of your desires. For that Compassion Ritual, you need to follow up on it. For example, if you wanted a raise at work, you need to approach your boss and discuss terms. For the Destruction Ritual, you should should be satisfied that they aren't going to disturb you anymore. You aren't carrying the energy so they have no power over you. If something happens to them, all the better. Magick is not wishing or praying, Magick IS motivation and doing. If you are looking for resources your Satanic Ritual, read The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals by Dr. LaVey. In his books you will find the proper design outlines to create your own Satanic Ritual. But always keep in mind that any Satanic Ritual can be modified. You don't have to stick to any pattern for the ritual. Anyone can tell you to do this or do that, but until you have that motivation in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"you, it will not work. In closing, for Satanic Ritual to work, you must first want it then get up off your ass and make it happen! Satanists are not sheep waiting to be fed, Satanists are wolves ready for the hunt!
