I in t end ed T h e Sa t an i c Bib l e i t sel f t o be an “instructional rant”, albeit a necessary and largely rational one. I felt that one could rant and still make sense. T o simply reprint Might is Right would make for compelling reading, but be ripped to shreds by liberal, self-styled rationalists. Not wishing to throw the baby out with the bathwater , I decided to immortalize a writer who had profoundly reached me. Clearly , “Ragnar Redbeard” was a man of erudition and conviction, though he may have often had a snoot full, as we shall see. No attempt had been made to avoid credit to “Ragnar Redbeard”, like Jimmy Durante’ s “Mrs. Calabash – wherever you are”. Until several printings into the book, the dedication page announced: “to Ragnar Redbeard, whose Might is Right.” What I question is: What took so long to discover and r eprint Might is Right after The Satanic Bible had been out for years? The answer may be found in the word “Zeitgeist” . The new Swedish translation of The Satanic Bible has restored the original dedication page. Like “Enochian” to occultists, Might is Right has become a required treatise for right-wing treaders of the Left Hand Path who accept the book with little or no reservation. There is so much brilliance there, that the blind spots cannot do the whole an injustice. It is, despite my enthusiasm for the book, innacurate to state that Might is Right was the inspiration for the Church of Satan. For the record; I was relatively young when I discovered it, but I had already indulged myself the experience of reading every scrap of anarchist, nihilist, extremist, and “free-thought” esoterica I could encounter . A day hardly passes, that I don’t read a comment from someone who is astounded at how close his own thoughts come to the message of my Satanic Bible."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 My Satanic world view had been well established by past performance. I had devoured the works of T wain, London, Brann, Nietzsche, W est, Hecht, W ood, Machiavelli, Finney , von Castiglione, and Shaw . I was impressed by Darwin, Spencer , Freud, Ingersoll, Gobineu, LeBon, and V oltaire. And those were only the tip of the iceberg. If Might is Right can be said to have been an inspiration for The Satanic Bible, it was in its concise and brutal style and format . It reinforced what V oltaire had believed: the little pocket-sized tract was the most powerful weapon of revolution. It has recently been claimed that Might is Right was the inspiration for the Nazi movement. W ith due respect to Mr . Hitler , Satan rest his soul, I don’t think he ever set eyes on Might is Right , but had done his own share of homework and thinking out of his premises for Mein Kamf. Again: diverse minds can think similar thoughts. It is unlikely ANYONE after 1930 would have known of, much less preached the gospel of Might is Right , had not The Satanic Bible br ought it to light in 1969 . I encouraged Church of Satan scholars in their quest for another printed copy of the book, even after I believed I had ascertained the true identity of its author . Book search services produced nothing. Then, one day in 1971, a CoS member provided me with a photocopy of Might is Right which he had discovered in, of all places, the New Y ork City Public Library . Now , at least, a second copy had been discovered. • • • • • • • • • My evidence indicates that Jack London wrote Might is Right . If he didn’t, he thought enough of it to transcribe it. As far back as 1964, I was shown works of the hard-living, hard-drinking author which had (like certain writings of Mark T w ain) be en withhe ld fro m pu blica tion be c a use of the i r inflammatory nature. After all – was not Jack London a respected writer whose works were taught in every public school in a land which prided itself on its democratic ideals? My sources were Sibley Morrill and V ir ginia Harner ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Mrs. Harner , mother of famed anthropologist Michael Harner , and Mr . Morrill were members of the “Magic Circle” – the Order of the T rapezoid, which was to become The Church of Satan. Some of Jack London’ s unreleased writings were stored at the prestigious Bancroft Library , where Mrs. Harner worked as a long-time custodian and researcher . She was, at that time, a close friend of Sibley Morrill, a researcher and writer on esoterica without equal (ghost towns, anarchist cults and communes, crystal skulls, Kahuna magic (as well as pre-CoS articles on myself). Mrs. Harner and Mr . Morrill arranged to let me see the “forbidden” London material. A m o n g s ta c ks o f m a n u s c r ip ts , a pp e a re d e nt ir e sections of Might is Right in London’ s own hand. Elated as I was, I was not surprised, knowing what I did of Jack London. If London didn’ t author what I saw , he liked it so much he made his own copy . I don’t want to whitewash London/Redbeard. He was a wild man. T oo often, “fans” want to keep their heroes pristine, especially where Satanic connections inconveniently surface. It has happened with many , from Benjamin Franklin to Mark T wain to Jayne Mansfield. One of the most flagrant s u g a r -c oa t ings is c ontaine d i n a biography of Robe rt E . Howard, in which the author of a chapter on “ The ‘Satanic’ Poetr y ” of Howard, opines that those verses -- to me the most powerful writing of his entire output – were scribbled for shock value and couldn’t have been taken seriously . Mr . Howard at worst, had just gotten up o n the wrong side of bed when he wrote his most stirring and powerful litanies. It would be understandable that a broadside like Might is Right might not even see actual publication in the U.S. Many prominent authors, for various reasons, have had to see their work first published in foreign editions – and in some cases, a language in which they were never written. B. T raven, the world’ s champion mystery man writer , (The Ghost Ship, The T r easur e of the Sierra Madr e) , used a long list of aliases, and even in personal dealings never tumbled as to who he was. I know , because I met him in Mexico shortly before his death. Everyone who knew him and his young girlfriend indulged him"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 his eccentricity and their privacy . Much of T raven’ s output was originally published in German, even at times when he was living in Chicago. He was a haunted looking man with a twinkle in his eye – probably from maintaining his charade most of his life. He even spoke of himself in the third person, as “Mr . T raven’ s agent.” Y et he told me that he had been a Satanist since he was born and, like the shark, he never slept. T o venture that Jack London was not only capable of Might is Right, but predisposed, one must understand that the man was rather complex. He was a werewolf. Y es, you read right. His preoccupation with wolves and his related after - hours activities made him as close to a true lycanthrope as could be believable. The stone ruins of his burned-out “W olf House” in northern California’ s V alley of the Moon still show evidence of cells wherein selected “guests” would be reputedly ring-bolted to walls for “treatment” by bullwhip. His grave is a few heavily wooded steps away , under a lar ge boulder situated to be exposed to the light of the full moon. Though a Socialist by admission, he was in a special category I would call a “Sadistic Darwinian Socialist”. In Might is Right (as “Ragnar Redbeard”) he had no need to couch his misanthropia in fiction, as he did when writing himself into The Sea W olf. Why wouldn’ t Jack London have written Might is Right ? His turn-of-the-century time frame, literary style, and p e r s o n a l i t y p r o f i l e w o u l d m a k e h i m t h e m o s t l i k e l y c a n d i d a t e . W h y e v e n l o o k f o r s o m e o n e o f l e s s e r q u a l i f i c a t i o n ? In a previous contemporary edition, I read where Might is Right was most likely written by an Australian named “Arthur Desmond”. Sounds OK to me. I never heard of Mr . Desmond, but the editor of that edition must have had reason to give him credit. Maybe it was partly to defuse an unmentioned (and unconsulted) guy who walked past an old bookstore at the right time, was mighty impressed, and placed Might is Right on the map. I trust this timely and unaltered edition will satisfy a n e e d e d c om p le tio n of a bi z a rr e , b ut pio ne e rin g l ite r a r y excursion.

If we would retain and defend our inherited manhood, we must not permit ourselves to be forever rocked to repose with the sweet lullabies of eastern idealisms. T oo long we have been hypnotized by the occult charm of Hebrew Utopianism. If we continue to obey the insidious spell that has been laid upon us, we will wake up some dread morning with the gates of hell – “of hell upon earth” yawning wide open, to close again upon us forever . T he idea of he ll is in so me re spe c ts a truthful conception, suggestive of actual fact. If we terrestialize the location, there is nothing inharmonious about it. Many a race, many a tribe and many a mighty empire has gone down into a grimly realistic Sheol.

Is it not right that they should be, as it were, fried and toasted – should swim in pools of boiling blood, or dance sweltering satanic glees, with blistered feet and straining eye- balls on red-hot Saharas of grave and sand? In actual operation Nature is cruel and merciless to men, as to all other beings.

This can never be accomplished until the racial mind has first been thoroughly cleansed and drastically disinfected of its depraved, alien and demoralizing concepts of right and wrong. In no human brain can sufficient space be found for the relentless logic of hard fact, until all pre-existent delusions have been finally annihilated. Half measures are of no avail, we must go down to the very roots and tear them out, even to the last fiber . W e must be, like Nature, hard, cruel, relentless.

He who is slow to believe anything and everything is of great understanding, for belief in one false principle is the beginning of all unwisdom. The chief duty of every new age is to up-raise new men to determine its liberties, to lead it towards material success – to rend (as it were) the rusty padlocks and chains of dead custom that always prevent healthy expansion.

Wherever , therefore, a lie has built unto itself a throne, let it be assailed without pity and without regret, for under the domination of a falsehood no nation can permanently prosper . Let established sophisms be dethroned, rooted out, burnt and destroyed, for they are a standing menace to all true nobility of thought and action. Whatever alleged “truth” is proven by results, to be but an empty fiction, let it be unceremoniously flung into the outer darkness among the dead gods, dead empires, dead philosophies and other useless lumber and wreckage. The most dangerous of all enthroned lies is the holy , the sanctified, the privileged lie – the lie that “everybody” believes to be a model truth. It is the fruitful mother of all other popular errors and delusions. It is hydra-headed. It has a thousand roots. It is a social cancer . The lie that is known to be a lie is half eradicated, but the lie that even intelligent persons regard as a sacred fact – the lie that has been inculcated around a mother ’ s knee – is more dangerous to contend against than a creeping pestilence. Popular lies have ever been the most potent enemies of personal liberty . There is only one way to deal with them. Cut them out, to the very core, just as cancers are. Exterminate them root and branch, or they will surely eat us all up. W e must annihilate them, or they will us. Half and half remedies are of no avail. However , when a lie has gone too far – when it has taken up its abode in the very tissues, bones and brains of a people, then all remedies are useless. Even the lancet is of no avail. Repentance of past misdeeds cannot “save” decadence from extermination. The fatal bolt is shot; and into the fiery furnace of wholesale slavery and oblivion they must go, to be there righteously consumed. From their ashes something new , something nobler may possibly evolve, but even that is the merest optimistic supposition. In Nature the wages of sin is always death. Nature does not love the wrong-doer , but endeavors in every possible way to destroy him. Her curse is on the brow of the “meek and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 lowly”. Her blessing is on the very hearts’ blood of the strong and the brave. Only Jews and Christs and other degenerates think that rejuvenation can ever come through law and prayer . “All the tears of all the martyrs” might just as well have never been shed. 4 Whatsoever a people believeth shall make it free, enslave it or corrode its very marrow in strict accordance with natural order . Consequently , if a people place implicit faith in what philosophers teach them, they are liable to be duped. If many nations are so duped, their deception is a menace to the liberty of the world. Freemen should never regulate their conduct by the suggestions or dicta of others, for when they do so, they are no longer free. No man ought to obey any contract, written or implied, except he himself has given his personal and formal adherence thereto, when in a state of mental maturity and unrestrained liberty . It is only slaves that are born into contracts, signed and sealed by their progenitors. The freeman is born free, lives free and dies free. He is (even though living in an artificial civilization) above all laws, all constitutions, all theories of right and wrong. He supports and defends them of course, as long as they suit his own end, but if they don’ t, then he annihilates them by the easiest and most direct method. There is no obligation upon any man to passive obedience, when his life, his liberty and his property are threatened by footpad, assassin or statesman. One of Columbus’ s lieutenants in the W est Indies, captured a Carib chief by means of a subtle stratagem. The chief was invited to a feast and when there, persuaded with honeyed words to don (on horseback) a set of brightly polished steel manacles; it being cunningly represented to him, that the irons were the regalia of sovereignty .

Like that Spanish lieutenant the masters of the earth first flatter their dupes in order to more easily enchain them. Who talks nowadays of the “sovereign people” without a laugh of derision? And yet it was once thought to be a term full of significance. Their ‘sovereignty’ is now acknowledged sham, and their freedom a dream. The sovereign people be. – It is clear , therefore, that the man or nation that would retain liberty or be really safe must accept no formula as final – must trust in nothing written or unwritten, living or dead – must believe neither in special Jehovahs, nor weeping Saviors – neither in raging devils, nor in devilish philosophies – neither in ghosts, nor in idols, nor in laws – nor in woman, nor in man. “O threats of hell, and hopes of paradise, One thing at least is certain – this life flies; One thing is certain and all the rest is – lies, The flower that once has bloomed forever dies.” 5 He who saith unto himself, “I must believe, I must not question” is not a man but a mere pusillanimous mental gelding. He who believes “because it has been handed down” is a menial in his heart; and he who believes “because it has been written” is a fool in his folly . Sagacious spirits doubt all things, and hold fast only to that which is demonstrably true. The rules of life are not to be found in Korans, Bibles, Decalogues and Constitutions, but rather the rules of decadence and death. The “law of laws” is not written in Hebrew consonants or upon tables of brass and stone, but in every man’ s own heart. He who obeys any standard of right and wrong, but the one set up by his own conscience, betrays"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 himself into the hands of his enemies, who are ever laying in wait to bind him to their millstones. And generally a man’ s most dangerous enemies are his neighbors. M a s te rf ul m e n la ug h w ith c ont e m pt a t s pi ritu a l thunders, and have no occasion to dread the decisions of any human tribunal. They are above and beyond all that. Laws and regulations are only for conquered vassals. The free man does not require them. He may manufacture and post up Decalogue regulations, to bind and control dependents with, but he does not himself bow down before those inventions of his own hands, except as a lure. Statute books and golden rules were made to fetter slaves and fools. V ery useful are they for controlling the herds of sentenced convicts who fill the factories and cultivate the fields. All moral principles, therefore, are the servitors, not the masters of the strong. Power made moral codes, and Power abrogates them. A man is under no obligation to obey anything or anybody . It is only serving-men: – must obey , because they are caitif fs by birth, breeding and condition. Morals are only required in an immoral community , that is to say , a community held in a state of conquest. Fear God, bridle the spirit and obey the law is advice most excellent, as from a philosopher to a yokel, but when directed in all earnestness at a man of inherent might, he smiles to himself in silent scorn.

This unspoken thought gives to all truly great men their manifest superiority over the brainless, vociferating herd. The “common"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 people” have always had to be befooled with some written or wooden or golden Idol – some constitution, declaration or gospel. Consequently , the majority of them have ever been mental thralls, living and dying in an atmosphere of strong illusion. They are befooled and hypnotized even to this hour , and a large proportion of them must remain so, until time is no more. Indeed the masses of mankind are but the sediment from which all the more valuable elements have been long ago distilled. They are totally incapable of real freedom, and if it were granted to them, they would straightaway vote themselves a master , or a thousand masters within twenty-four hours. Mastership is right – Mastership is natural – Mastership is eternal, but only for those who cannot overthrow it and trample it beneath their hoofs. Is it not a fact that in actual life the ballot-box votes of ten million subjective personalities are as thistle down in the balance, when weighed against the far seeing thought and material prowess of, say , ten strong silent men? 6 I t is notor ious, un i v er sa lly s o, tha t th e b lac ke s t falsehoods are ever decked out in the most brilliant and gor geous regalia. Clearly , therefore it is the brave man’ s duty to regard all sacred things, all legal things, all constitutional things, all holy things with more than usual suspicion. “I deny and I affirm,” is the countersign of material freedom. “I believe and I obey” is the shibboleth of serfage. Belief is a flunky , a feminine – Doubt is a creator , a master . He who denies fundamentals is in triple armor clad. Indeed, he is invulnerable. On the other hand, it has been said that every belief, every philosophy has some truth in it, but so, we might add, has every insanity . Strong men are not deterred from pursuing their aim by anything. They go straight to the goal, and that goal is Beauty , W ealth and Material Power .

The world would indeed be a house of horrors, if all men were “good” and all women padlocked. As far as human searchlights have yet penetrated into the darkness that enshrouds the origin of nations, we see the subduers and the subdued, the plebeians and the patricians, the chiefs who governed, and the vassals who obeyed. And there is nothing in the most modern social developments (of these deedless days) to warrant any belief that this ancient and natural division of human animals, into castes of superiors and inferiors, sovereigns and serfs, can ever be dispensed with. The slave-owner ’ s whip cracked from the beginning, and it will crack till the day of doom. In every kingdom, republic and empire on earth we have (in one disguise or another) the master and the slave – the ruler and the ruled. In the course of centuries names alone have changed, essentials have remained the same. Forms of royalty may alter , but kings can never die. There was mastership at the beginning, and there will be mastership to the end. W e build, but as our fathers built. Change is not progress, nor numbers advance. Every one who would be free must show his power . Unalterable remains the basis of all earthly greatness. He who exalteth himself shall be exalted, and he who humbleth himself shall be righteously trodden beneath the hoofs of the herd. “The humble” are only fit for dog’ s meat. Bravery includes every virtue, humility , every crime. He who is afraid to risk his life must never be permitted to win anything. Human rights and wrongs are not determined by Justice, but by Might.

Religions are the matrix in which public institutions are generally molded.

Even now , the anointed and sanctified head of the Catholic Church resurrects the same hoary old utopianism, in a Jesuitic encyclical addressed to his flock.

The grafting of flesh, bone and skin has, also, been successfully performed. American sherif fs and detectives hunt down tramps and criminals with specially trained bloodhounds, just as Russians hunt wolves and sheep farmers hunt coyotes and dingos. It is nowise unusual for Negros to be first captured, then chained to a stake, flayed alive, soaked in kerosene and burnt to death amid exultant shrieks of corybantic delight. Roman Senators fattened their lampreys and eels upon the drowned bodies of old worn out slaves, and patrician maids and matrons (with uplifted thumb) sent many a gladiator to kingdom come. For innate cruelty of deed, no animal can surpass woman. In Mahometan Europe boys are unsexed by the lancet, that they may thereafter be more safely employed as harem- attendants, and in Christian Europe “eunuchs are made and trained and priced to sing the praise of a risen Christ.” Y oung girls are nightly bought and sold for currency , like horses and hogs at the street corners.

It is the same offense that the people of Alba, the Fidenians, and Ardeans gave you, and lately the V ienians, the Falisci and the V olsci. T o avenge yourselves, you took up arms and washed your injury in their blood; you subdued the people, pillaged their houses and laid waste their cities and their countries, and in this you did no wrong or injustice; you obeyed the most ancient laws, which gave to the Strong the possessions of the W eak, the sovereign law of nature, that begins with the gods and ends with the animals.

First, warring against the rivalry of the elements, they develop the tremendous motor-power necessary in after life for the mastership of man-herds. Entering into the centers of semi- moribund civilizations, they straightway take the lead as a matter of natural right. They become rulers, chancellors, kings, conquerors, electric batteries, dynamos.

Force propels iron-ribbed reindeers of the sea and hurls them plunging through the grey-green surges. Force whirls the loaded freight cars over prairie, range and river . Force hauls-up from the deep sunk mines, vast treasures of gold, iron, silver and coal. Force rolls the red-glowing metal ingots into titanic shapes. Force sows the seed, ploughs the field, reaps the grain, threshes the corn, hews the stone, shapes the girders, bridges, rivers, mows down forests, builds cities, writes the book – inspires it, prints it, defends it.

As it was in the days of the fierce Sesostris, the devastating Genghis, the venture-some Charlemagne, so is it even now . In all industrial relations Might is “monarch of all it surveys”.

It is as natural for men of Power to rule Feeble multitudes, as for the lion to eat the lamb. When any nation or class of men possesses no real might, it is just and proper that they should be subordinated. And again, if they develop the requisite strength, it is equally justifiable for them to reconquer their former position and subordinate their subordinators. Evolution works through Authority , but there is to it no limitation. The penalty of defeat is tremendous. W age-earning is (in modern times) the main clause in the treaty under which the defeated are permitted to exist. Even-handed Justice has never existed in the animate creation and never can.

It is the business of the rich to exploit the poor , and it is equally the business of the poor to defeat and exploit in their turn. The oppression of one class by another is always induced by the physical cowardice of the victimized, and Nature has no love for dastards – whether rich or poor . Oppression is one of the necessar y phases of evolution.

Business lives under a cloud of mortgage indebtedness that must some day be liquidated with shot and shell, for bonds infer bondage. All realized wealth is transfigured Force, and want of it, a sure sign of sterility and degeneracy . Industrialism is the manipulation of Force – by Force. Brains and muscles are part of the mechanism of gravitation. Descendants of “prisoners- of-war” have been trained for ages in servitude, and they make most intelligent mechanics, specialists and serving-men. Capital is concentrated Force applied to the extraction and storage of additional Force. It may be operated by its proprietor in any way that he pleases. He is under no obligation to others as to its application or proprietorship. He can “do as he likes with his own” as long as he has the power . He may own the earth by its agency , if he wants to, and he may buy or sell men and nations, if he feels so inclined or thinks it profitable. There is in Nature no limit to his ener gies or ambitions. All that is needed is Power equal to the design. But the same principles may be acted upon by any other man or association of men; and in the conflict that ensues, fitness is pr oved absolutely and without doubt . The “rights of the rich” are what they can maintain, and the “rights of the poor” are no less. No bounds are set to the accumulation of property and none whatever to its re-distribution. Fair-play is not even an essential or a requisite. It may be established, if mutually de s i re d by both c om bata nts, but it m a y als o be wholl y dispensed with.

It is the creation of man, and what man manufactures he may modify or destroy . Society may be defined as an agglomeration of carnivorous and herbivorous animals, seeking their natural prey and browsing along on whatever nutriment they pick-up. It is nothing more than a “herd” of two-legged cattle, and there’ s nothing supernaturally divine about a herd. Indeed, the word herd always suggests G a da ra .

If the females behave badly , the male chastises them; they crouch at his feet, seem to beg his pardon, and shed copious tears. At times the male and female weep together .” A geographer and naturalist of world-repute, (A.R. W allace) proclaims a series of similar facts – facts that are not new to observant minds:– “Among the higher animals it is a very general fact, that the males fight together for the possession of the females. This leads . . . to the stronger or better armed males, becoming t he p a r e n ts o f th e ne xt g e n e r a t io n, w h ic h in he ri ts th e peculiarities of the parents; and thus vigor and offensive weapons are continually increased in the males, resulting in the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"163 strength and horns of the bull, the tusks and shield of the boar , the antlers and fleetness of the stag, and the spurs and fighting instinct of the gamecock.

They have also, as in the case of mankind, to defend their females, as well as their young, fr om enemies of all kinds, and to hunt for their joint subsistence.” Among the V ertebrates, the king of the herd (or pack), selects himself by his battle-prowess – upon the same ‘general principles’ that induced Napoleon to place the Iron Crown upon his own brow – with his own hand.

A woman is primarily a reproductive cell-or ganism, a womb structurally embastioned by a protective, defensive, osseous network; and surrounded with the antenae, and blood vessels, necessary for supplying nutriment to the growing ovum or embryo. Sexualism and maternity dominate the lives of all true women. T o such an extent is this so, that they have little time left (or inclination) to ‘think’ and therefore they’ve never been fitted out ab-initio with reasoning or gans.

However he ‘won’ by for ce , and consequently became a mighty potentate. King David was a sheep-stealer and black-mailer , until he triumphed. Then he became ‘a man after Gods own heart.’ W illiam the Norman was also a criminal, and fifty per cent of his invading army were exiled outlaws; but by conquest he became king of England, and his followers blossomed into nobles. Hence the Spencerian dictum: – “The sole truth that transcends experience, by underlying it, is the Persistence of Force. This being the basis of experience, must be the basis of any scientific or ganization of experiences. T o this an ultimate analysis brings us down; and on this a rational synthesis must be built up.” Criminals and statesmen are visible embodiments of the Persistence of Force? Now that being so; scientists should define, unmistakably , what they mean by ‘crime,’ before commencing to elaborately tabulate ‘the criminal type.’ But whether a criminal is successful or not, he seems to have a peculiar fascination for women. He who ‘risks his life to advance his fortunes’ may reckon beforehand upon unlimited feminine approval. If he succeeds and becomes a millionaire, a chancellor , a pesident, or a king; he has only to ‘hold up his hand’ to be literally ‘rushed’ by the handsomest feminines in the land; and even if he fails bravely , women will gather in shoals to visit him in gaol, besieging him with bouquets and proposals of marriage, even at the gallows.

Whenever the supply exceeds the demand, they are straightway transmuted into magdalenes, concubines, slaves, (or ‘new women’). When few in number (as in young colonies) they possess a certain proportion of selective influence, but when for every eligible man, there is a core of eligible women, their market value dwindles, and instead of ‘selecting,’ they become ‘the selected’ or as Darwin puts it: – “The sexual struggle is of two kinds. In the one it is between the individuals of the same sex, generally the males, in order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining passive; while on the other , the struggle is likewise between the individuals of the same sex, generally the females, which no longer remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners.” (V ide “D ESCENT OF M AN ”) In a reasonably natural Society , the most vigorous males would possess Property and Power .

Hence also the need of training them, from boyhood up, to conquer and overthrow their oppressors and personal enemies – at any cost – at any peril. By no known alchemy can a race of warriors and freemen be evoluted out of a ‘flock of bleating, baaing, lapping lambs, suckled on teats of priest-rid dams.’ “The qualities which have enabled the T uetonic races to play their wonderful part in the history of Europe, are well displayed in the valiant sons of T ancred, of Hautonville – W illiam Iron Arm – Robert Guiscard – Roger , and the rest; who carved out kingdoms for themselves in Apulia and Sicily . They were a vigorous race, large of limb, stout of heart, tenacious of will; with abundant phyical energy , taking their pleasures in drinking and hunting. They had broad shoulders, fair hair , blue eyes; as we see in Anna Comnenia’ s portrait of the son of Robert Guiscard, Bohemnd, Prince of T arentum, who was ‘a cubit taller than the tallest man; . . . with blue eyes, his cheeks tinted with golden red.’ (T aylor ’ s Origin Aryan Race.) 9 All hireling labor is corroding, corrupting, degrading, devilish.

From the beginning of time, the defeated classes have ever been the laboring classes – the tennants – the vassals – the sans-cullotes; and the conquerors (their heirs or assigns) have always provided (or hired) the priests, generals, taskmasters, and rulers. This is as true of the United States (a European colony) as it was of Thebes, T roy , Babylon, Persia, Carthage, Rome. “Fallen from primeval innocence and ease, (When thornless fields employed him, but to please) The laborer toils – and from his dripping brow , Moistens the lengthening furrows of the plough.

The ancient Servi knew that they were held in bondage by force of arms; but modern slaves being born, maniacal degenerates, don’t know it. Indeed the free workmen of England and America, can be compared to nothing more appropriate than Ibsen’ s ‘hero,’ who fancied himself a reigning monarch (with the fate of empires in his n o d) w h e n in s i de a C a i ro m a d ho u s e h is he a d w a s ceremoniously encircled with a diadem of straw . (“His brow is wet with honest sweat” is the National Anthem of an insane asylum). From whatever side we view him, the average hireling is a shameless contemptible being. He cannot be classified among ‘men,’ any more than a capon can be classified as a gamecock. Continuous drudgery stiffens his body – ossifies both his hand and brain – makes him and idiot in fact. Even women (indulgent though they be) regard him as a disdainful object, incapable of either great thoughts, great deeds, or of providing them with a home. Hirelings are nearly always on the ver ge of pauperdom – always praying, howling, and weeping before their taskmasters, crying out with a loud voice like spoilt babies, “O don’t hurt us – don’ t hurt us – we are so ‘good’ – so law-abiding – we love Jesus so!” Capitalists, kings, a nd p r e s i de nt s n e v e r t a k e th e s e s e r v ile h ou n ds in to consideration – nor do sensible women. In grand af fairs hirelings are merely inventoried as so much raw material, or so many herd of cattle; and in sexual affairs, they must of necessity , mate themselves with second-rate women – who cannot possibley find anything more to their taste. What woman in her senses desires to be a breeder of drudges, lunatics, and sans-cullotes? The very idea of ‘Labor ’ is in chains and yokes.

Gilmore Anton LaV ey’ s great achievement as a philosopher came through his ability to see in very disparate sources that which they hold in common. It is what I call a “resonance,” b a s e d u po n t he f u nd a m e n ta l “ to ne ” he c ho s e to m a k e axiomatic: the concept of the primacy of the individual. He composed a rational, earthy “chord progression” from these scattered resonant conceptual overtones and called it Satanism. This was done consciously as a means to oppose the prior dominance of the anti-individualist doctrines of Christianity and other spiritual religions. When Dr . LaV ey wrote “The Satanic Bible,” he decided that it would be appropriate to divide it into four sections, representing the primal four elements—fire, water , earth, and air—by way of the Crown Princes of Hell from diabolical tradition. Thus, his essays explaining the philosophy were gathered into “The Book of Lucifer” for air , enlightening readers as to the fundamental concepts. His explanations of ritual theory known as Greater Magic are the “Book of Belial,” connoting mastery of the earth. The actual texts for the rituals themselves are the “Book of Leviathan,” the stormy verbiage needed to evoke the full range of human emotion in the intellectual decompression chamber of ritual representing the sea and thus water . He needed something exceptionally potent for the “Book of Satan,” the texts embodying fire, and this he found in the book “Might Is Right” by someone with the nom de plume Ragnar Redbeard. Dr . LaV ey had tapped into many different philosophers and freethinkers who equally despised Christianity , but he needed something explosive, words that would ignite on the page and serve as phlogiston to the sensibilities of the type of individualist who would be LaV ey’ s"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"203 kin by inborn nature in a rejection of the fetid Nazarene. He re-examined Redbeard’ s lengthy and at times disjointed rant. “Might Is Right” had come his way many years earlier and had proven inspirational—this discovery is detailed in his introduction to this volume—and he saw the potential therein for distillation into a focused diatribe. He selected passages that could stand as eminent epigrams, numbered, ordered, and placed like ammunition in a magazine to be at ready to enflame his readers with the anger that is engendered when our kind considers the prevalence of the doctrines of the heaven-gazing sheep in W estern society . And Redbeard’ s words served him well, for in the mass-market format of “The Satanic Bible” they reached minds thirsty for dramatic images and firebrand thoughts to ignite what was hoped would be a funerary pyre for a religion whose death throes were expected. Dr . LaV ey brought the best of Redbeard from its limbo, out of print and out of mind, and so revived the bold spirit that had lain dormant—truly a magical w o r ki ng .

If it wasn’ t for “The Satanic Bible” and its original dedication page that included “T o Ragnar Redbeard, whose Might is Right,” the book you now hold in your hands may have continued to languish in obscurity—a fate that would be preferred by the Jesus-lovers and their lackeys. Y et since the publication of the seminal work that la u nc he d c onte m p ora r y S a ta nis m , a s w e ll a s su bs e que n t complete editions of Redbeard’ s book, we’ve seen in recent years a return to power of the Christian Right, particularly here in the United States, and the continued empowerment of fundamentalist Christianity and Islam in many other nations. Those who pledge allegiance to Jesus or Allah are moving to spread their doctrines to many who want no part of them; these fanatics are convinced that they are on a destined mission to dominate the “infidels” in hopes of gaining approbation in an afterlife that we know to be a delusion.

There is lasting power in Redbeard’ s writing, since “Might is Right” is an accurate depiction of how human societies function. Ironically , those who promote the doctrines of the so-called “Prince of Peace” for the past two thousand years have done so with tools of power—the sword, torture rack, the auto da fe, and, in more modern times, at gunpoint. While they deny the healthy normality of power and dominion in their philosophies, they use such techniques to enforce their beliefs. That doesn’ t surprise we Satanists, and it simply goes to prove Redbeard’ s thesis. He agitated for a more honest society , one that didn’ t uphold values that were false and abnormal to our species of feral primates. He wanted to purge society of hypocrisy , and for the nature of the beast called man to be celebrated, not denigrated. Whatever the actual name of the author of “Might Is Right” is finally proven to be, if ever , we know for certain that he was one of us—born with a character that finds doctrines of servility , spirituality , and cowardice to be revolting.
