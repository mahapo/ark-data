We would like to thank all who contributed to this project. May you be blessed in Lucifer's name. Naamah. Please Note: Amen is used in prayers herein. Amen, meaning \"So be it\" in Hebrew, has even earlier origins in prayer. In ancient Egypt Amen was the hidden aspect (and highest power) of Amen Ra. To send the prayer to the highest, most hidden aspect of deity, Amen was said at the end of prayer. For Satanists and Daemonolaters, you may end your prayer with Satan, Naamah, Lucifer, or simply Amen.

Since many Daemonolaters believe in the Hermetic foundation of our religion, we felt it proper to go back to the source for inspiration. We have included slight modification in some of them for Daemonolaters and Traditional/Theistic Satanists indicated by [ ]. Please note that Maat has been changed to Satan because both deity names represent the same. Heaven (in the sense of kingdom) has been changed to infernal kingdom. Heaven in the sense of enlightenment has been changed to Lucifer. Neter has been left alone. Neter is an Egyptian word for the forces that are god or a group of gods that is the same as the Demonic Divine."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"1. The [infernal] kingdom of Heaven is within you; and whosoever shall know himself shall find it. 2. The best and shortest road towards knowledge of truth [is] Nature. 3. For every joy there is a price to be paid. 4. If his heart rules him, his conscience will soon take the place of the rod. 5. What you are doing does not matter so much as what you are learning from doing it. 6. It is better not to know and to know that one does not know, than presumptuously to attribute some random meaning to symbols. 7. If you search for the laws of harmony, you will find knowledge. 8. If you are searching for a Neter, observe Nature! 9. Exuberance is a good stimulus towards action, but the inner light grows in silence and concentration. 10. Not the greatest Master can go even one step for his disciple; in himself he must experience each stage of developing consciousness. Therefore he will know nothing for which he is not ripe. 11. The body is the house of God [the Demonic Divine]. That is why it is said, \"Man know thyself.\" 12. True teaching is not an accumulation of knowledge; it is an awakening of consciousness which goes through successive stages. 13. The man who knows how to lead one of his brothers towards what he has known may one day be saved by that very brother. 14. People bring about their own undoing through their tongues. 15. If one tries to navigate unknown waters one runs the risk of shipwreck. Leave him in error who loves his error. 16. Every man is rich in excuses to safeguard his prejudices, his instincts, and his opinions."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 17. To know means to record in one's memory; but to understand means to blend with the thing and to assimilate it oneself. 18. There are two kinds of error: blind credulity and piecemeal criticism. 19. Never believe a word without putting its truth to the test; discernment does not grow in laziness; and this faculty of discernment is indispensable to the Seeker. Sound skepticism is the necessary condition for good discernment; but piecemeal criticism is an error. 20. Love is one thing, knowledge is another. 21. True sages are those who give what they have, without meanness and without secret! 22. An answer brings no illumination unless the question has matured to a point where it gives rise to this answer which thus becomes its fruit. Therefore learn how to put a question. 23. What reveals itself to me ceases to be mysterious for me alone: if I unveil it to anyone else, he hears mere words which betray the living sense: Profanation, but never revelation. 24. The first concerning the 'secrets': all cognition comes from inside; we are therefore initiated only by ourselves, but the Master gives the keys. 25. The second concerning the 'way': the seeker has need of a Master to guide him and lift him up when he falls, to lead him back to the right way when he strays. 26. Understanding develops by degrees. 27. As to deserving, know that the gift of Heaven [Lucifer] is free; this gift of Knowledge is so great that no effort whatever could hope to 'deserve' it. 28. If the Master teaches what is error, the disciple's submission is slavery; if he teaches truth, this submission is ennoblement. 29. There grows no wheat where there is no grain."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 30. The only thing that is humiliating is helplessness. 31. An answer is profitable in proportion to the intensity of the quest. 32. Listen to your conviction, even if they seem absurd to your reason. 33. Know the world in yourself. Never look for yourself in the world, for this would be to project your illusion. 34. To teach one must know the nature of those whom one is teaching. In every vital activity it is the path that matters. 35. The way of knowledge is narrow. 36. Each truth you learn will be, for you, as new as if it had never been written. 37. The only active force that arises out of possession is fear of losing the object of possession. 38. If you defy an enemy by doubting his courage you double it. 39. The nut doesn't reveal the tree it contains. For knowledge ... you should know that peace is an indispensable condition of getting it. 40. The first thing necessary in teaching is a master; the second is a pupil capable of carrying on the tradition. 41. Peace is the fruit of activity, not of sleep. Envious greed must govern to possess and ambition must possess to govern. 42. When the governing class isn't chosen for quality it is chosen for material wealth: this always means decadence, the lowest stage a society can reach. 43. Two tendencies govern human choice and effort, the search after quantity and the search after quality. They classify mankind. Some follow Maat [Satan], others seek the way of animal instinct. 44. Qualities of a moral order are measured by deeds. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"45. One foot isn't enough to walk with. 46. Our senses serve to affirm, not to know. 47. We mustn't confuse mastery with mimicry, knowledge with superstitious ignorance. 48. Physical consciousness is indispensable for the achievement of knowledge. 49. A man can't be judge of his neighbor's intelligence. His own vital experience is never his neighbor's. 50. No discussion can throw light if it wanders from the real point. 51. Your body is the temple of knowledge. 52. Experience will show you, a Master can only point the way. 53. A house has the character of the man who lives in it. 54. All organs work together in the functioning of the whole. 55. A man's heart is his own Neter. 56. A pupil may show you by his own efforts how much he deserves to learn from you. 57. Routine and prejudice distort vision. Each man thinks his own horizon is the limit of the world. 58. You will free yourself when you learn to be neutral and follow the instructions of your heart without letting things perturb you. This is the way of Maat [Satan]. 59. Judge by cause, not by effect. 60. Growth in consciousness doesn't depend on the will of the intellect or its possibilities but on the intensity of the inner urge. 61. Every man must act in the rhythm of his time ... such is wisdom. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"62. Men need images. Lacking them they invent idols. Better then to found the images on realities that lead the true seeker to the source. Maat [Satan], who links universal to terrestrial, the divine with the human is incomprehensible to the cerebral intelligence. 63. Have the wisdom to abandon the values of a time that has passed and pick out the constituents of the future. An environment must be suited to the age and men to their environment. 64. Everyone finds himself in the world where he belongs. The essential thing is to have a fixed point from which to check its reality now and then. 65. Always watch and follow nature. 66. A phenomenon always arises from the interaction of complementaries. If you want something look for the complement that will elicit it. Set causes Horus. Horus redeems Set. 67. All seed answer light, but the color is different. The plant reveals what is in the seed. 68. Popular beliefs on essential matters must be examined in order to discover the original thought. 69. It is the passive resistance from the helm that steers the boat. The key to all problems is the problem of consciousness. 70. Man must learn to increase his sense of responsibility and of the fact that everything he does will have its consequences. 71. If you would build something solid, don't work with wind: always look for a fixed point, something you know that is stable ... yourself. 72. If you would know yourself, take yourself as starting point and go back to its source; your beginning will disclose your end. 73. Images are nearer reality than cold definitions. Seek peacefully, you will find. 74. Organization is impossible unless those who know the laws of harmony lay the foundation. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"75. It is no use whatever preaching Wisdom to men: you must inject it into their blood. 76. Knowledge is consciousness of reality. Reality is the sum of the laws that govern nature and of the causes from which they flow. 77. Social good is what brings peace to family and society. 78. Knowledge is not necessarily wisdom. 79. By knowing one reaches belief. By doing one gains conviction. When you know, dare. 80. Altruism is the mark of a superior being. 81. All is within yourself. Know your most inward self and look for what corresponds with it in nature. 82. The seed cannot sprout upwards without simultaneously sending roots into the ground. The seed includes all the possibilities of the tree. ...The seed will develop these possibilities, however, only if it receives corresponding energies from the sky. 83. Grain must return to the earth, die, and decompose for new growth to begin. 84. Man, know thyself ... and thou shalt know the gods. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" A L -J ILWAH The Al-Jilwah is the disputed (among many Satanists) scripture of many modern theistic Satanists. Allegedly from the Yezidi tradition, this particular scripture is of questionable origin, but does mark a significant place in modern Satanic Literature. It is included here because many Daemonolaters and Theistic Satanists find strength and comfort within the writings despite its controversial origins. So for those who criticize the Al-Jilwah, view it as simply Satanic Literature and interpret it as metaphor and allegory. I suspect you might find something interesting from that perspective. For others, enjoy it as you always have. Please note that the *I* in this text, is viewed as Satan referring to Himself."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"AL-JILWAH (THE REVELATION) Before all creation this revelation was with Melek \u001f â’ûs, who sent ‘Abd \u001f â’ûs to this world that he might separate truth known to his pa rticular people. This was done, first of all, by means of oral tradition, and afterward by means of this book, Al-Jilwah, which the outsiders may neither read nor behold. CHAPTER I I was, am now, and shall have no end. I exercise dominion over all creatures and over the affairs of all who are under the protection of my image. I am ever present to help all who trust in me a nd call upon me in time of need. There is no place in the universe that knows not my presence. I participate in all the affairs which those who are without call evil because their nature is not such as they approve. Every age has its own manager, who directs affairs according to my decrees. This office is changeable from generation to generation, that the ruler of this world and his chiefs may discharge the duties of their respective offices every one in his own turn. I allow everyone to follow the dictates of his own nature, but he that opposes me will regret it sorely. No god has a right to interfere in my affairs, and I have made it an imperative rule that everyone shall refrain from worshiping all gods. All the books of those who are without are altered by them; and they have declined from them, although they were written by the prophets and the apostles. That there are interpolations is seen in the fact that each sect endeavors to prove that the others are wrong and to destroy their books. To me truth and falsehoo d are known. When temptation"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"comes, I give my covenant to him that trusts in me. Moreover, I give counsel to th e skilled directors, for I have appointed them for periods that are known to me. I remember necessary affairs and execute them in due time. I teach and guide those who follow my instruction. If anyone obey me and conform to my commandments, he shall have joy, delight, and goodness. CHAPTER II I requite the descendents of Adam, and reward them with various rewards that I alone know. Moreover, power and dominion over all that is on earth, both that which is above and that which is beneath, are in my hand. I do not allow friendly association with other people, nor do I deprive them that are my own and that obey me of anything that is good for them. I place my affairs in the hands of those whom I have tried and who are in accord with my desires. I appear in divers manners to those who are faithful and under my command. I give a nd take away; I enrich and impoverish; I cause both happine ss and misery. I do all this in keeping with the characteristics of each epoch. And none has a right to interfere with my management of affairs. Those who oppose me I afflict with disease; but my own shall not die like the sons of Adam that are without. None shall live in this world longer than the time set by me; and if I so desire, I send a person a second or a third time into this world or into some other by the transmigration of souls. CHAPTER III I lead to the straight path without a revealed book; I direct aright my beloved and my chosen ones by unseen means. All my teachings are easily applicable to all times and all conditions. I punish in another world all who do"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"contrary to my will. Now the sons of Adam do not know the state of things that is to come. For this reason they fall into many errors. The beasts of the earth, the birds of heaven, and the fish of the sea are all under the control of my hands. All treasures and hidden things are known to me; and as I desire, I take th em from one and bestow them upon another. I reveal my wonders to those who seek them, and, in due time my miracles to those who receive them from me. But those who are without are my adversaries, hence they oppose me.

Connolly This commentary was actually written for another project, however, since I own the rights to this essay, I thought I would include it in the prayer/scripture book as insight for those Demonoaltors looking at the Al-Jilwah and wondering why it was included. When it comes to the Al-Jilwah of the Yezidis, the seasoned occult scholar can immediately and clearly define the roles of Demons, although differently named, in the Yezidis tradition. The Yezidis is a small sect comprised of approximately 200,000 followers. Like many Demonolatry sect traditions, the Yezidis pass their faith to each subsequent generation. This tradition has been passed orally. The sect was studied extensively in the late 19th and early 20th century by theologians from across the globe, who found interesting similarities to Chris tianity within the religious structure of the sect. Some speculate the sect is much older than Christianity and conformed some of its original traditions to the mold of the Christian ways in order that they might survive the Christian onset. Aside from Christian tradition there are also traces of Muslim and Persian influence. There are nine positive influence “arch- angels” or “Demonic entities” worshipped by the Yezidis. While there is little documentation of true Demonolatry sects in history, the Yezidis, although obscure and not necessarily considered Demonolaters by all, remain the best-documented and resear ched Demonolatry sect of all time outside the Western Demonolatry community. That is, of course, if you believe the Yezidis comprise a valid Demonolatry sect. There is a lot of controversy among Demonolaters regarding the validity of such claims since, when shown"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"copies of the translated Al Jilwah and the “Black Book”, some Yezidis priests were amused, while others were offended. It is really unclear whether the Yezidis are actually worshiping angels or demons or even Satan as many Westerners think. In recent years, the Al-Jilwah has become a prominent text in the modern Theistic and Traditional Satanism movement, but has still not become a text of influence for many Demonolaters simply because of its somewhat Abrahamic overtones (mainly deity having human shortcomings and there being a war against good and evil with man as the warrior pawns in the middle). Others, however, have found it a scripture of some personal significance and have found strength and comfort in the text’s literary allu sion and metaphor. Once you take the text out of its alleged historical context and view it as simply a piece of influential Satanic literature, the Al Jilwah takes on a life of its own and gives a subtle message of strength and lessons to live by for all who dare tread the darker path. Personally, as a Daemonolatress, I do not view the text of the Al Jilwah historically or literally or from an Abrahamic viewpoint. Instead, I look at it and see a piece of controversial literature that hides a fascinating perspective. The following is my personal interpretation of the Al-Jilwah as Satanic litera ture from a Demonolater’s perspective. CHAPTER I I was, am now, and shall have no end. I exercise dominion over all creatures and over the affairs of all who are under the protection of my image. I am ever present to help all who trust in me and call upon me in time of need. There is no place in the universe that knows not my presence. I participate in all the affairs which those who are without call evil b ecause their nature is not such as they approve. Every age has its own manager, who directs affairs according to my decrees. This office is changeable from generation to generation, that the ruler of this worl d and his chiefs may discharge the duties of their respective offices every one in his own turn. I allow everyone to follow"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"the dictates of his own nature, but he that opposes me will regret it sorely. No god has a right to interfere in my affairs, and I have made it an imperative rule that everyone shall refrain from worshiping all gods. All the books of those who are without are altered by them; and they have declined from them, although they were written by the prophets and the apostles. That there are interpolations is seen in the fact that each sect endeavors to prove that the others are wrong and to destroy their books. To me truth and falsehood are known. When temptation comes, I give my covenant to him that trusts in me. Moreover, I give counsel to the skilled directors, for I have appointed them for periods that are known to me. I remember necessary affairs and execute them in due time. I teach and guide those who follow my instruction. If anyone obey me and conform to my commandments, he shall have joy, delight, and goodness. The first chapter is not the description of a “God” necessarily. Instead, it descri bes the All of Creation. The Ether of All that Is, He that we Satanists and Demonolaters call, Satan. Basi cally it suggests that those who will never know the nature of Satan are without (i.e. ignorant). Not because there is a war between Abrahamic religions and “others” but rather because religion such as the Abrahamic triad of faiths, separates us from the spirit, and the source of our creation which is Satan. Those who are with, on the path of Satan, are joined with the source of all that is, and will grow in its infernal light. This also suggests one Deity above all others. While I view the wording as the author arrogantly anthropomorphizing deity (again), I also see it suggesting that all Gods are part of the One. They all must bow down to the one. This is a basic Hermetic concept regarding the source ruling over everything, including lower gods and all parts of the Whole. With regards to the passage, \"...and I have made it an imperative rule that everyone shall refrain from worshiping all gods.\" I view this line as not seeing the Gods as being above the All. Of course literally it suggests that Satan is judgmental and has human faults, which I don't agree with. So I think that line is simply in support of soft Polytheism (from a metaphoric perspective, of course)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" CHAPTER II I requite the descendents of Adam, and reward them with various rewards that I alone know. Moreover, power and dominion over all that is on earth, both that which is above and that which is beneath, are in my hand. I do not allow friendly association with other people, nor do I deprive them that are my own and that obey me of anything that is good for them. I place my affairs in the hands of those whom I have tried and who are in accord with my desires. I appear in divers manners to those who are faithful and under my command. I give and take away; I enrich and impoverish; I cause both happiness and misery. I do all this in keeping with the characteristics of each epoch. And none has a right to interfere with my management of affairs. Those who oppose me I afflict with disease; but my own shall not die like the sons of Adam that are without. None shall live in this world longer than the time set by me; and if I so desire, I send a person a second or a th ird time into this world or into some other by the transmigration of souls. Obviously descendents of Adam is a metaphor for humans. I am unsure why the author of this text chose an Abrahamic metaphor to de scribe mankind. My only thought on this is the possibility that perhaps Adam comes from Atem or Atum, as we were considered children of Atem by the Ancient Egyptians, who also held the philosophies that the Gods and Man all came from the same source and that source was the source of All, Atem (also Satan). I, like many Demonolaters, believe that most of Abra hamic myth, prayer, ritual, etc... was taken from ancient cultures (Egypt and Sumeria). The second chapter really focuses on balance, duality, and polarity, much like the Hermetic principle of polarity. It also suggests universal consciousness and pre-destination, that life is cyclic, which we know to be true. CHAPTER III I lead to the straight path without a revealed book; I direct aright my beloved and my chosen ones by unseen means. All my teachings are easily applicable to all times and all conditions. I punish in another world all who do contrary to my will. Now the sons of Ad am do not know the state of things that is to come. For this reason they fall in to many errors. The beasts of the earth, the birds of heaven, and the fish of the sea are all under the control of my"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"hands. All treasures and hidden things are known to me; and as I desire, I take them from one and bestow them upon another. I reveal my wonders to those who seek them, and, in due time my miracles to those who receive them from me. But those who are without are my adversaries, hence they oppose me. Nor do they know that such a course is against their own interests, for might, wealth, and riches are in my hand, and I bestow them upon every worthy descendant of Adam. Thus the governme nt of the worlds, the transition of generations, and the changes of their directors are determined by me from the beginning. \"Teachings\" for \"all times and conditions\", and the control of all living things, suggests to me the natural laws. This entire chapter simply defines the nature of Satan as a natural part of the universe. CHAPTER IV I will not give my rights to other gods. I have allowed the creation of four substances, four times, and four comers; because they are necessary things for creatures. The books of Jews, Christians, and Moslems, as of those who are without, accept in a sense, i.e. , so far as they agree with, and conform to, my statutes. Whatsoever is contrary to these they have altered; do not accept it. Three things are against me, and I hate three things. But those who keep my secrets shall receive the fulfillment of my promises.

Do not mention my name nor my attributes, lest ye regret it; for ye do not know what those who are without may do. \"Four Substances, Four Times, and Four Corners\", from my perspective, obviously refers to the elements because they’re all necessary for life. We require air to breathe, and water to drink, and the earth for our food, and lastly, fire for warmth and helping life to flourish. By saying that man cannot go against Satan, this is not like upsetting your Dad, but rather causing irreparable damage to the universe itself or the nature sustaining us (global warming comes to mind) that will cause our own demise (punishment for ruining nature and that which sustains our own lives). This could also be viewed as"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"eating poorly, or smoking, or doing something bad for your health (unnatural) causing your own death (hence punishment). This is basically saying your body, your planet, and your universe is your temple. Treat all of them with care or risk destroying yourself. CHAPTER V O ye that have believed in me, honor my symbol and my image, for they remind you of me. Observe my laws and statutes. Obey my servants and listen to whatever they may dictate to you of the hidden things. Receive that that is dictated, and do not carry it before those who are without, Jews, Christians, Moslems, and others; for they know not the nature of my teaching. Do not give them your books, lest they alter them without your knowledge. Learn by heart the greater part of them, lest they be altered. The servants are the Demons from my perspective. The Demonic Divine who teach the wisdom of Satan’s natural laws and guide us thr ough our physical lives and on to the next plane of existence. The latter sentences simply say that none of this can be written down. True understanding comes from with in because all books (even this one) can be rewritten to mean something else or interpreted in a number of wa ys, hiding the true wisdom and knowledge. True wisdom and knowledge, as the Egyptians pointed out, is not something that can be memorized and spat out. True wisdom and knowledge comes from experience. I think much of the Al-Jilwah seems anti- Abrahamic in general. Not because of a war between \"good and evil\". Basically I think it means that the minute we show the nature of the universe to those who don't get it (certain groups of Christians, for example) - they're going to deny it and try to suppress it like they have done with certain scientific discoveries, stem cells, global warming, and evolution to name a few. All of these natural things - when presented to certain institutions of Christianity (or"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"other Abrahamic faith), have ca used conflict. I kind of look at all of the statements suggesting we separate ourselves from Abrahamic religion as \"Don't talk to the brick wall because you're wasting your breath.\" And this, my brethren, is how I interpret the positive and hopeful message of the Al-Jilwah from a Demonolatry and Literary perspective.
