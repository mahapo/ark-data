[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"R ITES OF S PRING by Magister Michael Rose Introduction: The following ritual was performed March 4th, XXXVI A.S., during a photo shoot for an upcoming book about religions of the wo rld. This is an ongoing project by photojournalist Brennan O’Conner; it should take him about three year s to complete. This is a Spring ritual and even a lust ritual of sorts that reco gnizes life springing forth from Winter’s icy grasp. It is a cel ebration of that feel ing wh ich all beas ts experience at this time of year that most wo uld cal l Spring fev er, that primordial instinct wh ich sparks the mating cal l. During the ritual the cel ebrant and his assistant invoke fem ale nymphs to awak en the lusts of Pan from his wintery sleep . We added some real bum p and grind stripper music to bridge from the solem nity of the organ music and the ritual formalities into the dance performed by the nymphs. This added that final visual assaul t and a touch of hum our so often lack ing in many ritual s I have witnessed. Aft er the ritual we had a sum ptuous banquet complete with fruit, meat , chees es, wine and the finest of Ales.
