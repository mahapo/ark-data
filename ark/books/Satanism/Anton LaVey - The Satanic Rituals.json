They all have one thing in common-homage to the elements truly representative of the other side. The Devil and hi s works have long assumed many forms. Until recently, to Catholics, Protestants were devils. To Protes- tants, Catholics were devils. To bot h, Jews were devils. To the Oriental, the Westerner was a devil. To the American setder of the Old West, the Red Man was a devil. Man's ugly habit of elevating himself by defaming others is an unfortunate phe- nomenon, y et apparently necessary to his emotional well-being. Though these precepts are diminishing in pow er, to virtually everyone some group represents evil incarnate. Yet if a hum an being ever thinks that someone else considers him wrong, or evil, or expendable in the affairs of the world, that thought is quickly banished. Few wish to carry the stigma of villain. But wait We are experiencing one of those unique periods"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"in history when the villain consistently becomes heroic. The cult of the anti-hero has exalted the rebel and the malefactor. Because man does little in moderation, selective acceptance of new and revolutionary themes is nonexistent. Consequently all is chaos, and anything goes, however irrational, that is against established pol icy. Causes are a dime a dozen. Rebellion for rebellion's sake often takes precedent over genuine need for change. The oppos ite has become desirable, hence this becomes the Age of Satan. Dire as this appears, yet when the dust of the battles settles what truly needed changing will have been changed. The sacrifices will have been offered, hum an and ot herwise, so that long-range development might continue, and stability return. Such is the odyssey of the twentieth century. The acceleration of man's development has reached an epic point of change. The evasive theologies of the immediate past were necessary to sustain the hum an race while the higher man developed his dreams and m aterialized his plans, until the frozen sperm of his magical child could be born upon t he earth. The child has emerged in the form of Satan-the oppos ite. The cold and hun gry of the past produced offspring to till the fields and work the mills. Their cold will stop and their hunger shall end, but they will produce fewer children, for the by-product of the magician's frozen seed which has been born upon t he earth will perform the tasks of the hum an offspring of the past. Now it is the higher man's role to produce the children of the future. Quality is now more important than quantity. One cherished child who can create will be more important than ten who can produce-or fifty who can believe! The existence of the man-god will be apparent to even the simplest, who will see the miracles of his creativity. The old belief that a supreme being created man and m an's thinking brain will be recognized as an illogical sham. It is altogether too easy to dismiss Satanism as a total invention of the Christian Church. It is said that the principles of Satanism did not exist before sectarian propaganda invented Satan. Historically, the word Satan did not have a villainous meaning before Christianity. The \"safe\" schools of witchcraft, with their strict adherence to their horned-god-fertility-symbol syndrome, consider the words Devil and Sat an anathema. They disclaim any associa- tion. They wish no c omparisons to be drawn linking their Mur- rayite-Gardnerian-\"neo-pagan\"-\"traditional\" beliefs with Diabolism. They have expunged Devil arid Sat an from their vocabulary, and ha ve waged a tireless campaign to give dignity to the word witch, though that has always been synonymous with nefarious activity, whether as witch, or hexe, or venifica, or other. They wholeheartedly accept the Christian evaluation of the word Sat an at face value, and ignore the fact that the term became synonymous with evil simply because it was (a) of Hebrew origin, and anything Jewish was of the Devil, and (b) because it meant adversary or oppos ite. With all the debate over the origin of the word witch, and the clear origins of the word Satan one would think that logic would rule, and Satan would be accepted as a more sensibly explained label.* Even if one recognizes the character inversion employed in changing Pan (the good guy) into Satan (the bad guy), why reject an old friend just because he bears a new name and unj ustified stigma? Why do so many still feel it mandatory to disavow any connection with what might be classed as Satanic, yet increasingly use each and every one of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the arts that were for centuries considered Satan's? Why does the scientist, whose academic and laboratory forebears suffered from accusations of heresy, mouth platitudes of Christian righteousness in one breath, while dismissing the concept of *Controversy over the origin of the English word witch is valid when one considers the etymology of the term in other languages: veni fica (Latin), hexe (German), streghe (Italian), etc. Only in its English form has the word assumed a benign origin: wicca, purportedly meaning \"wise.\" Any debat e must center on recent claims that advance a positive and socially acceptable meanin g for a term that has in all ages and most languages, meant \"poisoner,\" \"frightener,\" \"enchant er,'' \"spell-caster,\" or \"evil woman.\" Anthropologists have shown that even in primitive societies notably the Azande, the definition of witch carries malevolent connotations. Therefore, are we to assume that the only \"good\" witchet in the world were English witches? This, however, beco mes difficult to accept when one considers the term wizard, which stems from the Middle English wysard = w ise, versus the Old English wican = to bend, from whence witch is supposedly de- rived. A ll in all, it seems to be an unsucces sful attempt to legitimatize a word that probabl y originated by onomatopoeia-the formation of a word that sounds like what it is intended to mean! Satan in the next, when the man of science owes his heritage to what had for hund reds of years been relegated to Devildom? The answers to these questions can be reduced to a single bitter charge: they cannot afford to admit to an affinity with anything that bears the name of Satan, for to do so would necessitate turning in their good-guy badges. What is even worse, the followers of the \"Witchcraft-NOT-Satanism!\" school harbor the same need to elevate themselves by denigrating others as do their Christian brethren, from whom they claim emancipa- tion. The rites in this book c all the names of devils-devils of all shapes, sizes and inclinations. The names are used with deliber- ate and appreciative awareness, for if one can pul l aside the curtain of fear and enter the Kingdom of Shadows, the eyes will soon b ecome accustomed and m any strange and wonderful truths will be seen. If one is truly good inside he can call the names of the Gods of the Abyss with freedom from guilt and immunity from harm. The resultant feeling will be most gratifying. But there is no turning back. Here are the Rites of Lucifer ... for those who da re remove their mantles of self-righteousness. Anton Szandor LaVey The Church of Satan 25 December VI Anno S atanas C O N C ER N I N G TH E R I TU A LS Fantasy plays an important part in any religious curricu- lum, for the subjective mind is less discriminating about the quality of its food t han it is about the taste. The religious rites of Satanism differ from those of other faiths in that fantasy is not employed to control the practitioners of the rites. The ingredients of Satanic ritual are not designed to hold the celebrant in thrall, but rather to serve his goals. Thus, fantasy is utilized as a magic weapon b y the individual rather than by the system. This is not meant to imply that there are not, nor there will not exist, those who will claim dedication to Satanism as an identity while continuing to be manipulated unknow ingly from without."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The essence of Satanic ritual, and Satanism itself, if taken up out of logic rather than desperation, is to obj ectively enter into a subjective state. It must be realized, however, that hum an behavior is almost totally motivated by subjective impulse. It is difficult therefore, to try to be objective once the emotions have established their preferences. Since man is the only animal who can lie to himself and believe it, he must consciously strive for some degree of self-awareness. Inasmuch as ritual magic is dependent upon e motional intensity for success, all manner of emotion producing devices must be employed in its practice. The basic ingredients in the casting of a spell can be categorized as desire, timing, imagery, direction, and balance. Each of these is explained in the author's prior work, The Sat ani c Bible. The material contained in this volume represents the type of Satanic rite which has been employed in the past for specialized productive or destructive ends. It will be observed that a pervasive element of paradox tuns throughout the rituals contained herein. Up is down, pleasure is pain, darkness is light, slavery is freedom, madness is sanity, etc. In keeping with the very semantic and etymologi- cal meanings of Satan, situations, sensations and values are often inverted and reversed. This is not intended solely to serve as blasphemy-on the contrary, it is used to make it ap- parent that things are not always as they seem and that no standard can or should be deified, for under the proper condi- tions any standard can be changed. Because Satanic Ritual so often exerts such change, both within the chamber and as an aftermath in the outside world, it is easy to assume that the upside-down cross and the Lord's Prayer recited backwards* usually linked with the Black M ass are also synonymous with Satanism. This generalization is correct in theory, since Satanism indeed represents the oppos ite viewpoint, and as such acts as a catalyst for change. The fact is, throughout history a \"bad guy\" has been needed so that those who are \"right\" can flourish. It was to be expected that the first Messes Noirs would institute reversals of existing liturgy, thus reinforcing the original blasphemy of heretical thought. Modern Satanism realizes man's need for an \"other side,\" and has realistically accepted that polarity-at least within the confines of a ritual chamber. Thus a Satanic chamber can serve -depending upon t he degree of embellishment and the extent of the acts within-as a meditation chamber for the entertain- ment of unspoken thoughts, or a veritable palace of perversity. Ceremonies such as the German Wahsinn d er Logi sch actually weld the concepts of Satanism and the manifestations of insanity into a total assumption of the role of needed social adversary. This phenomenon h as been eloquently defined by * Inaccur ate assumption; the traditional Messe Noir employs a parody of Matthew 6:9 rather than a word-order inversion. psychiatrist Thomas S. Szasz in The M anuf acture of M adn ess. Wherever this polarity of oppos ites exists, there is balance, life, and evolution. Where it is lacking, disintegration, extinction and decay ensue. It is high time that people learned that without oppos ites, vitality wanes. Yet oppos ite has long been synony- mous with bad. Despite the prevalence of adages like \"Variety is the spice of life.\"-\"It takes all kinds . . .\"-'The grass is always greener . . .\" many people still automatically condemn whatever is oppos ite as \"evil\" Action and reaction, cause and effect, are the bases of everything in the known uni verse. Yet when automobiles are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"generally large, it is said \"no on e will ever drive a small car,\" or when hem lines go up, \" they'll never wear long dresses again,\" etc. The mere fact that the smugness-and bo redom- of the popul ace rests on the mantra, \"It'll never happen!\" indicates to the magician that he must avoid such thinking. In magic the unexpected occurs-with such regularity, in fact, that it is safe to say that to dw ell on an ything too long i s to con- sum e it. Magic is a push/pull situation, like the universe itself. While one is pushing, he cannot pull. The purpose in ritual is to \"push\" the desired result within a unique span of time and space, then move away and \"pull\" by di vorcing on eself from all thought s and r elated acts pr evious ly ritual ized. The productions contained here fall into two distinct categories: ritual s, which are directed towards a specific end that the performer desires; and ceremoni es, which are pageants pay- ing hom age to or commemorating an event, aspect of life, admired personage, or declaration of faith. Generally, a ritual is used to attain, while a ceremony serves to sustain. For example, the traditional Black M ass would incorrectly be considered a ceremony-a pageant of blasphemy. Actually it is usually entered into for a personal need to purge oneself, via overcompensation, of inhibiting guilts imposed by Christian dogma. Thus it is a ritual . If a Black M ass is performed by curiosity seekers or \"for fun,\" it becomes a party. What constitutes the difference between a Satanic ceremony and a play presented by a theatre group? Often very little: mainly it hinges on the degree of acceptance on the part of the audience. It is of little consequence whether an out side audience does or does not accept the substance of a Satanic ceremony: the strange and grotesque always has a large and enthusiastic audience. Murders sell more newspapers than garden-club meetings. However, it is important to consider the needs of the participants: those who need Satanic ceremony most are the least likely to let themselves go before an audience of the curious. Unlike encounter groups, the purpose of most Satanic ceremonies is to elevate the self rather than demean it. Encoun- ter \"therapy\" is founded on t he premise that if one is reduced in stature by another, who in turn has been reduced, all will have a firm founda tion upon w hich to bui ld. In theory this is admirable, for those who pr efer to have som eone else insult and browbeat them. They attain thereby a rather dubi ous form of recognition. For the masochistically inclined, encounter groups do pr ovide a source of puni shment and recognition. But what of those who have established an identity, those who are winners in the world, and have pride and rational self-interest, yet who pos sess the desire to express unpopul ar thoughts? A ceremonial chamber essentially provides a stage for a performer who wishes complete acceptance from his audience. The audience becomes, in fact, part of the show. It has become fashionable in recent years to incorporate the audience into theatrical performances. This started with audience participa- tion, with selected members of the audience called up t o the stage to assist a performer in his role. Gradually this developed to such a degree that entire audiences mingled with the cast Still, there can be no assurance that an audience will participate as a result of genuine enthusiasm, or merely because they are expected-or coerced-to do so. A ceremony is dependent upon t otal single-mindedness of purpose on the part of all persons present. Even commemora-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"tive pageants of a publ ic nature suffer from divergence of thought and emotion during the festivities. A Fourth of July or Mardi Gras festival has a definite reason for its existence, yet how many participants maintain an awareness of its raison d'etre while revelling? The festival becomes only an excuse, so to speak-a theme upon w hich to base social needs. Unfortu- nately, too many arcane and occult ceremonies and rituals wind up as just such excuses for social (and sexual) intercourse. An important point to remember in the practice of any magic ritual or ceremony is: if you depend upon t he activities within the chamber to provide or sustain a social climate, the ensuing energy- cons cious or ot herwise- directed toward these ends will negat e any results you wish to obtain through the ritual! The line is fine between the desirability for close rapport between participants, and on e's need per se for close rapport. The ritual will suffer if there is a single person in the chamber who drains the substance from it by his ulterior motives. Hence it is better to have three participants who are \"with it\" than twenty who are and three who are not . The most effective rituals are often the most solitary. This is why it is preposterous to attempt a ritual or ceremony with outsiders present who happen to be \"sincerely interested\" or \"want to find out more about it\" or \"want to see what it's like.\" A philosophical commitment is a prerequisite for ac- ceptance into ritualistic activities, and this serves as a rudimen- tary screening process for organized Satanism. Consequently, a degree of compatibility-necessary to a successful working- exists within the chamber. Of course, anyone can say, \"I believe,\" simply to gain access. It will be up to the discerning magician to determine actual sincerity. Because Lesser M agi c is everyday magic, a finely attuned sense of discrimination is essential for all accomplishment. In addition, one of the most important \"commandments\" of Satanism is: Sat ani sm demands study -not worship! This book w as, for the most part, written because the author believes that ritual magic should be removed from the sealed vacuum in which it has been held by occultists. Scant yean ago, The Sat ani c Bible first publ icly advanced magical techniques and working procedures utilizing sexual energy and other emotional responses. Since then many volumes have appeared that give identical principles, in bot h technical and esoteric jargon. It is expected that the precedent established by the present work will likewise \"free\" others to reveal \"hidden mysteries.\" Why, it will be asked, is it deemed feasible to make these rituals publ ic know ledge? Primarily because the demand is great -not only from curiosity-seekers, but from those who thirst for more than what is offered by the recent outpourings of pseudo- Cabbalistic, crypto-Christian writing. A nother reason for this book i s that there are many recent awesome discoveries which give the sorcerer new tools with which to experiment. That is also why it is now \"safe'1 to advance much of the present material. A third reason, and perhaps the most important of all, is that magic-like life itself-produces what one puts into it This principle can be observed in countless facets of hum an behavior. Human beings invariably treat things (property, other persons, etc.) with the same degree of respect with which they regard themselves. If one has little self-respect, no m atter how much of a surface ego is present, one has little respect for anything else. This will lessen or negate ultimate success-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"magical or otherwise. The difference between prayer and m agic can be compared to the difference between applying for a loan and writing out a blank check for a desired amount. A man applying for a loan (prayer) may have nothing but a job as collateral and m ust keep working and pay interest, should the loan be granted. Otherwise he will wind up w ith bad credit (purgatory). The man (magician) who writes the desired amount on the blank check, assumes there will be delivery of the merchandise, and he pays no interest He is indeed fortunate- but he had better have sufficient funds (magical qualities) to cover the amount written, or he may wind up i n far worse straits, and have his creditors (demons) out looking for him. Magic, like any other tool, requires a skilled hand. T his does not mean that one need be a magician's magician or an advanced scholar of occult teachings. But it requires an applica- tion of principles-principles (earned through study and experi- ence. Life itself demands application of certain principles. If one's wattage (potential) is high, and the proper principles are applied, there is very little that cannot be accomplished. The more readily one can apply the principles needed to effect a proficiency in Lesser M agi c, th e greater one's chances of attain- ment through the use of ritual - or ceremoni al- magic. Satanic Ritual is a blend of Gnostic, Cabbalistic, Hermetic, and M asonic elements, incorporating nom enclature and vi bra- tory words of power from virtually every mythos. Though the rituals in this book a re representative of different nations, it will be easy to perceive a basic undercurrent through the cultural variants. Two each of the rites are French and German, their pre- ponderance accountable to the rich wealth of Satanic drama and liturgy produced by those countries. The British, although enamored of ghosts, hauntings, pixies, witches, and m urder mysteries, have drawn most of dieir Satanic repertoire from European sources. Perhaps this is because a European Catholic who wanted to rebel became a Satanist: an Englishman who wanted to rebel became a Catholic-that was blasphemy enough! If most Americans' knowledge of Satanism is gleaned from the tabloid press and hor ror films, the average Briton can boast of \"enlightenment\" from the pens of three of their writers: Montague Summers, Dennis Wheatley and Rollo Ahmed. The notable British exceptions to what historian Elliot Rose terms die \"anti-Sadducee\" school of literary probing into Satanism, are that author's bold work, A Razor for a G oat ; and Henry T. F. Rhodes' comprehensive study, The Sat ani c Mass. Approximately half of the rites contained in this volume can be performed by four or less persons, thereby eliminating problems or failures which can arise if quantity takes precedence over quality in the selection of dram atis persona e. Where group solidarity and singleness of purpose exists, ceremonies such as Das Tierdram a, H om age to Tchor t and The Call to C thul hu, can be celebrated effectively by a larger num ber of participants. For the most part, the rites should be begun and ended with the procedures standard to Satanic liturgy. These are presented in detail in The Sat ani c Bible, and are indicated wherever the term standar d sequence, or custom ary mann er (or die equivalent), appears in the present text. Accouterments necessary to all rites, as well as the Enochian C alls, are likewise given in the Bible. As to the pronunciation of the names involved (despite"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"some occultists who insist, \"You can't expect help from the forces you call upon i f you can't pronounc e their names right,\"), assume that the forces, demons, or elementals have enough insight to judge a caller's worthiness on m ore profound c riteria than his glib tongue or expensive shoes. Pronoun ce the names as they sound b est to you, but don't assume that you have the correct pronunciation, exclusive of all others. The \"vibratory\" rate of the names is only as effective as your own ability to \"vibrate\" while saying them, neither of which terms is to be confused with vibrato. The success of magical operations is dependent upon appl ication of pr inciples learned rather than the amount of data collected. This rule must be stressed, for ignorance of this fact is the one most consistent cause of magical incompetency-and the least likely to be considered as the reason for failure. The most successful individuals throughout history have been the people who learn a few good tricks and apply them well, rather than those with a whole bag full who don 't know which trick to pul l out at the right time-or how to use it once they get it out! Much magical curricula is padded beyond belief with pseudo-esoteric data, the purpose of which is: (a) to make it tougher to learn, since no on e places any credence in what comes too easy (though they constantly seek shortcuts, give- aways and m iracles); (b) to provide many things that can go wrong, so that if a ritual doesn't work it can be said that the student was delinquent in his studies; (c) to discourage all but the most idle, bored, talentless, and ba rren (translation=intro- spective, mystical, spiritual) persons. Contrary to popul ar as- sumption, esoteric doctrines do not discourage nona chievers but actually encourage them to dwell in loftier ivory towers. Those with the greatest degree of nat ural magical ability are often far too bus y with other activities to learn the \"finer\" points of the Sephi roth, Tarot, I Ching, etc. This is not intended to suggest that there is no va lue in arcane wisdom. But, just because one memorizes every name in a telephone directory it does not mean he is intimately ac- quainted with each person listed. It is often said that magic is an impersonal tool and there- fore neither \"white\" nor \"black,\" but creative or destructive, depending upon t he magician. This implies that-like a gun- magic is as good or bad as its user's motivations. This, unfortu- nately, is a half-truth. It presumes that once a magician activates his magical weapon i t will serve him according to his own propensities. If a magician were dealing with only two elements-himself and hi s magical force-this theory could be valid. But unde r most circumstances, hum an actions and events are influenced and carried out by other hum an beings. If a magician wants to effect a change according to his will (personal) and employs magic as a tool (impersonal), he must often rely on a hum an vehicle (personal) to carry out his will. No matter how im- personal a force magic is, the emotional and behavioral pattern of the hum an vehicle must be considered. It is too often assumed that if a magician curses someone the victim will meet with an accident or fall ill. This is an over- simplification. Often the most profound m agical workings are those which engage the assistance of other unkno wn hum an beings in order to effect the magician's will. A magician's destructive wish toward another may be justified by all laws of natural ethic and fair play, but the force that he summons may"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"be wielded by a mean, worthless person-one whom the magi- cian himself would despise-in order to complete the working. Oddly enough, this manner of operations can be employed for benevolent or amorous-rather than destructive-ends with equal success. The Sat ani c Bible states that the magician should treat the entities he calls upon a s friends and companions, for even an \"impersonal\" device will respond b etter to a conscientious and respectful user. This principle is accurate for operating auto- mobiles and po wer tools, as well as demons and elementals. It will be apparent to some readers that Satanic rites of the type contained in this book c an act as catalysts for the ac- tions of great num bers of people, and indeed they have- acting, in the words of Lovecraft, as the mind that is held by no he ad. Whenever reference in this book i s made to a priest, the role may also be taken by a woman who can serve in the capacity of priestess. It must be clarified, how ever, that the essence of Satanism-its dualistic principle-necessarily imposes an active/ passive dichotomy upon t he respective roles of celebrant and altar. If a woman serves as a celebrant, then for all intents and purposes she represents the masculine principle in the rite. The pervasive theme of active/passive (Yin/Yang) in human relations cannot be stifled, despite attempts to create matriarchal, patriarchal, or unisexual societies. There will always be those who \"might as well be men\" or \"might as well be women,\" depending upon t heir endocrinological, emotional and/or behavioral predilections. It is far sounder, from a magical standpoi nt, for an ego-driven or forceful woman to conduct a ritual, rather than a shy, introspective man. It might prove awkward, how ever, to cast a passive man in the role of Earth-Mother-as the altar-unless his appearance conveyed the image of a woman. An exclusively hom osexual group can often conduct more fruitful rituals than a group w ith bot h heterosexual and hom o- sexual participants. The reason is that each person in an afl- homophile group is usually more aware of the individual active/passive propensities of his associates, and this ensures accurate role casting. It must be stressed that both male and female principles must be present, even if the sam e sex portrays both. With few exceptions the rituals and ceremonies in this book h ave been written to meet existing conditions and require- ments. Because a workable format depends on fairly recent standards of language, readily-understandable rubrics and emo- tion-producing litany cannot be set down without a certain degree of \"Satanic license.\" There are virtually no S atanic rites over one hundr ed years old that elicit sufficient emotional response from today's practitioner, if the rites are presented in their original form. When the rites were initially conceived, they were amply provocative to the wizards who pr acticed them, of course. In short, one no longer reads a Victorian romance for sexual titillation. No single element of a magical rite is quite as important as the words which ate spoken, and unl ess the litany of a ritual is stimulating to the speaker, silence is far more desirable. The celebrant or priest conducting a rite must serve as a soundi ng board for the emotions of those in attendance. Through the strength of his words, his listeners' potential charge of magical energy can be inspired to peak intensity or wane to lethargy out of sheer boredom. However, many people are bored by any litany, no m atter how meaningful or eloquent, so it behoove s"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the magician to select his co-workers with care. Those who are perennially bored are usually stupid, insensitive, unimaginative individuals. They are deadwood i n any ritual chamber. Naturally, there is a reasonable level of possible emotional response which must be unde rstood when selecting a litany to he used for ceremonial purposes. A wizard or cultist of 1800 may have thrilled at his words when speaking of \"waiting at the darkness visible, lifting our eyes to that bright Morning Star, whose rising brings peace and salvation to the faithful and obedient of the hum an race.\" Now he may say, \"standing at the gates of Hell to summon Lucifer, that he might rise and show himself as the harbinger of balance and truth to a world grown heavy with the spawn of holy lies,\" in order to engender the same emotional response. The guiding thoughts behind Satanic rituals past and pr es- ent have emanated from diverse minds and pl aces, yet all operate on m uch the same \"frequency.\" Many people who never conceptualized their personal philosophies discover that the principles of Satanism are an unequalled vehicle for their thoughts; hence the title of \"Satanist\" is now being claimed by its rightful owners. Those who di sagree with the non-Christian definition of Sat ani st, as set forth in The Sat ani c Bible, should examine the basis of that disagreement. It surely stems from one of two sources: \"common know ledge\" or scripturally founded propaganda. \"Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years!\"-the Ninth Satanic Statement-is not limited just to the religious organization re- ferred to as \"the church.\" How convenient an enemy the Devil has been for the weak and insecure! Crusaders against the Devil maintained that Satan, even if accepted on a n anthro- pomorphic basis, was neither so evil nor so dang erous that he coul d not be personal ly vanqui shed. And so Satan has existed as a convenient enemy to be employed when needed-one who could be beaten by any lily-livered popi njay who could find the time to arm himself with a barrage of scriptural rhetoric! Thus Satan has made cowards into heroes, weaklings into gladiators, and wretches into nobl es. That was so simply because his adver- saries were able to tailor the rules of the game to suit their own needs. Now that there are avow ed Satanists, who m ake their own standards, the rules of the game change. If a substance is harmful, its poisonous effects will speak for it. If Satanists are powerfully evil, then their foes have valid fears. The \"godly,\" have toughened Satan in his role of scapegoat, while keeping him nour ished and handy for their needs. Now it is they who ha ve weakened and atrophied while Satan breaks his bonds . Now Satan's people can speak for Him, and they have a weapon c alculated to annihilate the feeble and insipid mournings of the pulpit pound ers of the past. That weapon is logic. The Satanist can easily invent fairy tales to match anything contained in holy writ, for his background i s the very child- hood o f fiction-the myths immemorial of all peoples and all nations. And he admits they are fairy tales. The Christian cannot-no, dar es not-admit that his heritage is fairy tales, yet he depends on them for his pious sustenance. The Satan- ist maintains a storehouse of avow ed fantasy gathered from all cultures and from all ages. With his unfettered access to logic as well, he now becomes a powerful adversary of Satan's past tormentors. Those who have depended on f ighting the Devil to dis-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"play their \"goodness\" must discover a new adversary-one who is helpless, disorganized, and easily vanquished. But the world is changing fast and such a recruitment will prove diffi- cult, ... so difficult, in fact, that witch-hunters and devil finders may be forced to seek their quarry in the most impene- trable of jungles-themselves. Note In rituals where a foreign language is presented, the English translation usually follows after a brief space. Wherever both languages are so presented, onl y one should be employed. To reiterate a statement in an alternate language breaks the flow of the original statement. If the foreign text is used, the English translation should be studied beforehand, so the meaning of the foreign text will be fully unde rstood. LE MESSE NOIR T H E O R I G I N A L P S Y C H O D R A M A The Black M ass is a valid Satanic ceremony only if one feels the need to perform it Historically, there is no ritual more closely linked with Satanism than the Black M ass. It has long been considered the principal elective of Satanists, who were assumed never to tire of trampling on c rosses and of stealing unb aptized infants. If a Satanist had not hing else to do, and was independently wealthy, newer and m ore blasphem- ous versions of the Messe Noir would be invented in order to nourish his jaded existence, the theory went. Though a titillating concept to many, it is without validity, and as devoid of logic as the assumption that Christians celebrate Good F riday every Wednesday afternoon. Although the Black M ass is a ritual that has been per- formed countless times, the participants often were not Satan- ists, but would act solely on the idea that anything contra- dictory to God m ust be of the Devil. During the Inquisition, anyone who doubt ed the sovereignty of God and Christ was summarily considered a servant of Satan and suffered accord- ingly. The Inquisitors, needing an enemy, found on e in the guise of witches who suppos edly were subject to Satanic con- trol Witches were created in wholesale lots by the church from the ranks of the senile, sexually promiscuous, feeble- minded, deformed, hysterical, and anyone who happened to be of non- Christian thought or background. T here was only a minute percentage of actual healers and oracles. They were like- wise persecuted. There have been recent attempts to assess great num bers of \"witches\" of antiquity as rebels against the Christian Church who held Dianic \"esbats\" with furtive regularity. This presents"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"a charming picture. But it is folly, because it bestows a degree of intellectual sophistication on people who were essentially ignorant, and who were willing to go along with whatever form of worship the opinion makers gave them. At any rate, during the period when accounts of the Black Mass were employed as propaganda against \"heretical\" sects and orders, few cared about the finer points differentiating the witch from the Satanist. Both were as one in the eyes of the Inquisitors, although it is safe to say that unlike the majority who bor e the label of witch, those who conduc ted themselves \"Satanically\" often earned their stigma. This is not meant to condon e the actions of the Inquisitors against such freethinkers and rebels, but to concede that they were a very real threat to the holy fathers. Such men as Galileo and da Vinci, accused of traffic with the Devil, most certainly were Satanic in the sense that they expressed ideas and theories destined to break down the status quo. The suppos ed high poi nt of the Black M ass, alleged to be the offering to Satan of an unb aptized hum an child, was not quite the way the collectors of baptism fees gloatingly told it. Catherine Deshayes, known as LaVoisin, was a seven- teenth century French bus inesswoman who peddled drugs and performed abortions. LaVoisin arranged \"rituals, charms and spells\" for her clients, all of whom wished to retain the safety of the Church, but whose ineffectual prayers drove them to seek darker magic. This sort of desperate miracle seeking is as preva- lent today as it was then. In the performance of one of her more popul ar productions, a clandestine, highly commercial inversion of the Catholic mass, LaVoisin provided \"authen- ticity\" by actually engaging willing Catholic priests as celebrants and sometimes using an aborted fetus as a hum an sacrifice (Records indicate that she performed over two hund red abortions.) The priests who suppos edly celebrated the Black M ass for her supplied the holy propagandists with more material. If or- dained priests were occasionally prone to take part in heretical rites, it is understandable when one considers the social condi- tions at the time. For centuries in France many men became priests because they were from upper class families and the priesthood was de rigeur for at least one son of cultured or well-to-do parents. The first son became a military officer or politician, and the second w as sent off to a religious order. So controversial was this arrangement that it produced a catch phrase: \"Le roug e et noi r.\" If one of the young men happened to be of intellectual bent, which was often the case, the priesthood pr ovided virtu- ally the only access to libraries and avenues of higher learning. It was to be expected that the Hermetic principle of \"as above, so below\" and vi ce versa would apply to gifted and intelligent individuals. An inquiring, well-developed mind could often be dangerously skeptical and subsequently irreverent! Thus there was always a supply of \"depraved\" priests ready and willing to celebrate Satanic rites. History has, in fact, produced entire sects and m onastic orders that fell into hum anistic and iconoclastic fever. Think about it; you personally may have known of a priest or minis- ter who wasn't quite what he should have been ... ! Today, of course, in Christianity's death throes, anything goes in the clergy, and pr iests once tortured and executed for \"vile here- sies\" (Urban Grandier, for example) would seem like Boy"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Scouts by current standards of pastoral conduct. The seven- teenth century priests who celebrated the Black M ass need not have been intrinsically evil: heretical, most certainly; perverse, definitely; but harmfully evil, probably not. The exploits of LaVoisin, which have been recounted in such a sensational manner, if simplified reveal her as a beau- tician, midwife, lady pharmacist, abortionist, who had a flair for theatrics. Nevertheless, LaVoisin gave the Church what it needed: a real honest-to-Satan Black Mass. She provided much substance for their anti-heretic propaganda machine. LaVoisin put the Black M ass on the map, so to speak, and so succeeded in working some very real magic-magic far more potent than the spells she concocted for her clients. She gave people an idea. Those who leaned to the ideas expressed by LaVoisin's rites needed little encouragement to attempt to dupl icate the rites. For those persons the Black M ass provided a setting for various degrees of perversity, ranging from harmless and/or productive psychodrama to actual heinous acts that would sub- stantiate the chroniclers' wildest fantasies. Depending on in- dividual predilection, those who received inspiration from the likes of LaVoisin could either effect a therapeutically valid form of rebellion, or fill the ranks of the \"Christian Satanists\" -miscreants who adopt Christian standards of Satanism. One fact is irrefutable: for every unbo rn baby offered up \" in the name of Satan\" during LaVoisin's clandestine playlets, count- less thousands of living babies and small children have been slaughtered in wars fought in the name of Christ. The Black M ass which follows is the version performed by the Societe de s Luciferiens in late nineteenth and early twen- tieth century France. Obviously taken from prior Messes Noir, it also derives from the texts of die Holy Bible, the Missale Romanum , th e work of Charles Baudelaire and Charles Marie- George Huysmans, and the records of Georges Legue. It is the most consistently Satanic version this author has encountered. While it maintains the degree of blasphemy necessary to make it effective psychodrama, it does not dwell on inversion purely for the sake of blasphemy, but elevates the concepts of Satan- ism to a nobl e and rational degree. This ritual is a psychodrama in the truest sense. Its prime purpose is to reduce or negate stigma acquired through past indoctrination. It is also a vehicle for retaliation against unjust acts perpetrated in the name of Christianity. Perhaps the most potent sentence in the entire mass fol- lows the desecration of the Host: \"Vanish into the void of thy empty Heaven, for thou w ert never, nor shall thou ever be.\" The possibility that Christ was a total invention has occurred to investigators with increasing frequency. Many once existing social ramifications might have made this feasible. Perhaps the recent last ditch \"Christ, the man\" stand is an attempt to sus- tain a dying myth through use of a single reinforcing ele- ment-one with which all can identify-that shows him a fallible hum an being! Requi rements for Performance Participants consist of a priest (celebrant), his immediate assistant (deacon), a secondary assistant (subdeacon), a nun, an altar, an illuminator who hol ds a lighted candle where needed for reading, a thurifer, a gong-striker, an additional attendant and the congregation. Hooded black robes are worn by all participants except"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"two: a woman dressed as a nun, w earing the customary habit and wimple, and the woman who serves as the altar, who fa nude. The priest conducting the mass is know n as the cele- brant. Over his robe he wears a chasuble bearing a symbol of Satanism-the Sigil of Baphom et, inverted pentagram, in- verted cross, symbol of brimstone or black pine cones. Though some versions of the Black M ass were performed in vestments consecrated by the Roman Catholic Church, records indicate that such garments were the exception rather than the rule. The authenticity of a consecrated hos t seems to have been far more important. The woman who serves as the altar lies on the platform with her body at right angles to its length, her knees at its edge and widely parted. A pillow supports her head. Her arms are outstretched crosswise and each hand grasps a candleholder containing a black candle. When the celebrant is at the altar, he stands between the woman's knees. The wall over the altar should bear the Sigil of Baphom et or an inverted cross. If both are employed, the Sigil of Bapho- met must take the uppermost or prominent position, the cross occupying the space between the lower halves of the altar's legs. The chamber should either be draped in black or in some way approximate the atmosphere of a medieval or gothic chapel. Emphasis should be placed on s tarkness and austerity, rather than finery and glitter. All implements standard to Satanic ritual are employed: bell, chalice, phallus, sword, gong, etc. (see Sat ani c Bible for descriptions and us e). In addition a chamber pot, thurible (cen- ser) and incense boat are used. The chalice containing wine or liquor is placed between the altar's thighs, and on i t is a paten hol ding a round w afer of turnip or of coarse black bread. The chalice and paten should be shrouded with a square black veil, preferably of the same fabric as the celebrant's chasuble. Immediately in front of the chalice is placed an aspergeant or phallus. The ritual book i s placed on a small stand or pillow so that to is on the celebrant's right when he faces the altar. The illuminator stands at the side of the altar near the ritual book. Opposite him, on the other side of the altar, stands the thuri- fer with a thurible that holds ignited charcoal. Next to him stands the attendant holding the boat of incense. Music should be liturgical in mood, preferably played on the organ. The works of Bach, de Grigny, Scarlatti, Palestrina, Couperin, Marchand, C lerambault, Buxtehude and Franck are most appropriate.

Chambers \"Casilda's Song\" from The King in Yellow The Ceremony of the St ifling Air is the the which was performed when entering the sixth degree of the Order of the Knight s Templar. It celebrates a reawakening of the flesh and a rejection of past self-denials, and symbolic rebirth is attained through a contrived entombment. The ceremony originated in the thirteenth century. In its original form it was not the his- torical parody into which it later developed. Accounts of the performance of L'Air Epai s ultimately strengthened the charges of King Philip IV of France in his campaign to abolish the rich order, which was banished in 1331. The Templars had been exposed to the dualistic concepts of the Yezidis in the Near East They had seen pride glorified and life praised as never before, when they entered the Court- yard of the Serpent and the Sanctuary of the Peacock, where indulgence became tantamount to greater power. As a result, they developed what was destined to become one of the most significant rites of Satanism. Martyrdom, once believed de- sirable, was considered with disgust and ridicule, and fierce pride was to become the Templars' last image to the world. The philosophy of Sheik Adi and the Yezidis, applied to the already acquired wealth and ph ysical resources of the Templars, might have eventually drawn the Western world away from Christianity if not stopped. Even with the banish- ment of the Templars, their combination of prideful, life-ador- ing principles joined with Western goal-oriented materialism did not wholly succumb, as borne out by any history of post- Templar fraternal orders. As the Templars had gained power, they had become more materialistic and less spiritual minded. Rites such as The Stifling Air, therefore, presented timely and compatible state- ments to men who had turned from their earlier heritage of self-sacrifice, abstinence and pov erty. The fraternal attainment conferred by L'Air Epai s would correspond t o the thirty-fourth degree of Freemasonry, if such a grade existed. The present Scottish Rite ends at the Thirty- second de gree (Master of the Royal Secret), with an addi- tional degree conferred und er honor ary circumstances. Corres- pondi ngly exalted status is attained in York Rite Masonry at its tenth grade, which carries the title of Knight Templar. The original Templars' rite of the Fifth degree symboli- cally guided the candidate through the Devil's Pass in the mountains separating the East from the West (the Yezidi domain). At the fork of the trail the candidate would make an important decision: either to retain his present identity, or strike out on the Left-Hand Path to Schamballah, where he might dwell in Satan's hous ehold, having rejected the foibles and hypocrisies of the everyday world."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"A striking American parallel to this rite is enacted within the mosques of the Ancient Arabi c Order of the Nobl es of the Mystic Shr ine, an order reserved for thirty-second d egree Ma- sons. The Nobl es have gracefully removed themselves from any implication of heresy by referring to the place beyond the Devil's Pass as the dom ain where they might \"worship at the shrine of Islam.\" L'Air Epai s is impossible to perform without an indiscreet degree of blasphemy toward the Christian ethic, hence its ex- clusion from Masonic ritual, thereby halting any further pro- gression beyond the Thirty-third degree Scottish Rite and Tenth grade York Rite level. The Order of the Rosy Cross of Aleister Crowley's magic curriculum provided an interesting comparison in its Seventh degree (Adeptus Exemptus). In that rite, the alternative to taking the Left-Hand Path was to become a Babe of the Abyss, which is not as contradictory and confusing as it sounds , if one considers Crowley's ofttimes Machiavellian modus operandi. Crowley, nobod y's fool, simply set up a magical maze so that students whose consciences would only allow them to tread the Right-Hand Path would nevertheless wind up on t he Left. Fortunately, precious few of Crowley's disciples progressed as far as the grade of Adeptus Exemptus, thus neatly preventing problems that might have arisen from such rude spiritual awakenings. The overtly anti-Christian sentiments of The Ceremony of the St ifling Air classified it as a \"Black Mass,\" according to the accounts that were employed to indict the Templars. Upon a ssuming the Sixth degree, a candidate renounced all life-denying spirituality and acknowledged an und erstanding of the material world as a prerequisite to higher planes of existence. This is a ritual of the death-defiant and allows any unconscious death motivations to be exorcised. It is a statement of rebirth, of the delights of life as oppos ed to the negation of death. The celebrant in the original version of L'Air Epai s is represented as a saint, martyr, or other paragon of selflessness. This is done to emphasize the transition from self-denial to self-indulgence. The ceremony of rebirth takes place in a large coffin. The coffin contains an unclad woman whose task is to awaken lust in the \"dead\" man who joins her. L'Air Epai s can serve a twofold purpose; as a rejection of death and a dedication to life, or a blasphemy against those who crave misery, distress, and nega- tion. A celebrant who is basically life loving can release all needs for self-abasement by willingly \"dying,\" thereby exorcising the self-destructive motivations he might be harboring. L'Air Epai s is a ceremony through which one might get the idea of death over with and out of his system, while turn- ing death's accouterments into instruments of lust and life. The coffin, the principle device, contains the manifestation of the force that is stronger than death, the lust that produces new life. This is similar to the coffin symbolism that, with a euphe- mistic veneer, is found i n most lodge rituals. If the celebrant is patently masochistic, he can, through transference, become a surrogate for members of the congrega- tion who m ay harbor the same propensity. He suffers a fate worse than death when, within the coffin, instead of experiencing the hoped-for spiritual reward, he is confronted with unexpected passions from which he has long abstained. (If a hom ophile portrays the celebrant, the coffin should contain another male. In all aspects of the ritual, the element of pleasure should be whatever would most likely be denied in the celebrant's life.)"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The gravest puni shment is always incurred by one whose absti- nence has become his indulgence. Thus be warned: to the chronic lover of distress, ruin arrives through the bestowal of indulgence. This, then, can function as a literal interpretation of the phrase, \"to kill with kindness.\" When a \"man of God\" is portrayed by the celebrant, as in the later commemorative version of L'Air Epai s, the ritual will serve to weaken the collective structure of the organization he represents. This factor introduces an element of the Messe Noir into the rite, as mentioned by Lewis Spence and ot her writers. The title Stifling Air refers both to the tension pr oduced by the contrivedly oppressive atmosphere during the early seg- ments of the ceremony, and the closeness within the coffin. When the performance of L'Air Epai s was resumed in 1799, i t served as a celebration of the successful curse placed upon P hilip and Pope Clement V by Jacques de Molay, the last Grand M aster of the Templars, who had been condemned to death along with his Knights. The present text employs the actual curse leveled against the King and the Pope by de Molay. Though the dialogue of the Priest of Satan, the King, and the Pope are presented in modern French prose, the statements of de Molay have been retained in their actual stilted delivery. James Thompson's diabolical litany of the nineteenth century, The City of Dreadf ul Night , has long been employed as the Denun ciation. It is doubt ful that any words could be better suited to the occasion. P ortions of the text appear in Raynouard's drama of 1806, Les Templiers. The num erous manifestations of Satanism in Masonic ritual, for instance, the goat, the coffin, the death's-head, etc, can easily be euphemized, but the rejection of certain values demanded by L'Air Epai s cannot be cloaked in accepted theologies. Once the celebrant has taken this degree, he em- barks upon t he Left-Hand Path and chooses Hell in place of Heaven. Besides being both ritual and ceremony, The St ifling Air is a memento mori carried to its highest power. Requi rements for Performance The chamber must either be black, or mirrored. A mir- rored chamber provides greater confrontation for the celebrant, making him hyperconscious of his role. Mirrors also serve to \"rob the soul\" according to old tradition. An austere chair is provided in which the celebrant sits during the first part of the ritual. The coffin may be of any type, although a traditional hexagonal style is recommended, as this is the type depicted in the actual sigil of the Sixth degree of the Templars and, combined with the skull and crossbones, is retained in Masonic symbology. The coffin must be large enough to accommodate two persons, hence special construction or modification is likely to be necessary. The usual devices of Satanic ritual are all employed. Addi- tional accouterments include a cat-o'-nine-tails with which to scourge the celebrant, a cruet for the Wine of Bitterness, and a goblet The celebrant (Pope) is attired in tattered and de caying vestments. The King is represented as counsel for the celebrant; he wears rags and a miserable crown made out of cardboard. De Molay is dressed in Satanic splendor, with the mantle of the Templars and the symbols of his office. He carries a sword."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The woman in the coffin should be sensually appealing and seductive, the oppos ite of the wan, pale concept usually associated with death. For music suitable to this ritual, refer to Le M esse Noir , or employ Berlioz1 \"Funeral and Triumphal Symphony.\" Procedur e for Performanc e The ceremony begins in the customary manner, as de- scribed in The Sat ani c Bible. The Twelfth Enochian Key is read, and the Tribunal begins. After the accusations have been made, and the King allowed to intercede on occasion, judgment is passed and the priest reads the Denun ciation (City of Dread- ful Night ). Stopping halfway through the Denun ciation, the priest signals that the Wine of Bitterness be proffered to the celebrant who, accepting his last drink, listens while the litany is completed, after which the priest signals to make ready for the final abasement and joy for the celebrant. The lictors (guards) remove the celebrant from his seat and pl ace him, face downward, on t he coffin's lid. The priest then reads Biblical passage, Hebrews 1:6-12. After the scourging, the celebrant is lifted from the lid of the coffin. The priest then kno cks three times on the coffin with a staff or the pom mel of the sword A scream is heard from within the coffin, and the lid lifts from inside. The occu- pant's arms beckon s eductively. The celebrant is lowered into the coffin by the lictors, who leave him to his doom or re- newal, as the case may be. As the infusion takes place in the coffin, the priest reads the Thirteenth Enochian K ey. When the infusion is complete, the woman within shouts \"A ssez!\" (Enough!), and the celebrant is removed from the coffin and directed by the priest to speak. The celebrant proclaims his homage to Satan, and, showing his new allegiance, casts aside his symbols of martyrdom. The priest calls for the King, ostensibly to pursue his case. It is discovered that the King has disappeared. He has been banished to the place of eternal indecision and regret, where he must stand in a hum orless wind, hi s tatters blowing, with none to see ... forever. The priest presents his final proclamation and the ceremony is closed in the standard manner.

He, or his personification, always triumphs. No matter how methodically he may be relegated to infamy, he invariably winds up the popul ar favorite. As the inspirer of werewolves, he drove the Goths and Huns to their victories in Europe; as the final protagonist in the Nibelunge nsaga, he destroyed Valhalla and established his own reign on e arth. He became the hero, or at least the roguish and considerate villain, of the miracle plays. Throughout the Christian era he has held his own in German literature and drama better than any other character derived from the Bible. Dramas in which the Devil appeared in short scenes al- lowed him increasingly lengthy roles, until in many cases he had taken pos session of almost the whole play! He was, to be sure, almost always defeated and driven back to Hell with great tumult and upr oar, probably to satisfy the sense of righteousness of the publ ic. Especially since Faus t, Satan is no longer considered as the personification of unm itigated eviL In Faus t, though be still quests for hum an souls, he pities man-as does Nietzsche's Zarathus tra- and is depressed that those poor earthborn creatures are so narrow-minded and derive so little pleasure from life. Shaw was to echo these sentiments in Man and Sup erman, in which a very obliging Devil does all he can to see to the comforts of his guests in Hell. Like Shaw's Satan, the German devil is often seen as the catalyst of enlightened and pol ite behavior, optimistically de- serting the misanthropic role of Mephistopheles in Faus t. The image that eventually was to serve as the basis of contemporary German Satanic ritual can be seen in Carducci's Hymn t o Sat an, in which Satan is lauded as the spirit of progress, the inspirer of all great movements that contribute to the develop- ment of civilization and the advancement of mankind. H e is the spirit of revolt that leads to freedom, the embodiment of all heresies that liberate. He wins the undi vided admiration of man, and finally supercedes Jehovah as the object of worship. Of the two German rites included here, the Tierdram a is the older. The lessons taught by Aesopian allegory are the first essays to instruct man on t he pragmatic importance of applied psychology. Aesopian parable, which was recorded as early as 1500 B .C in Egypt, was late to appear in a German interpreta- tion. As a result, when Gotthold Lessing produced the parables in the eighteenth century, diey were readily assimilated into the heretical philosophy that considers the hum an animal as de- cidedly inferior in many respects to his all fours cousins. The substance of the Tierdram a is the admission of one's quadruped heritage. The purpose of the ceremony is for the participants to regress willingly to an animal level, assuming animal attributes of honesty, purity and increased sensory per- ception. The priest who pr onoun ces the Law maintains the cadence and order needed to remind each participant that though he is an animal, he is still a man. It is this that gives the Tierdram a its profound e ffect The rite was originally performed by the Order of the Illum inat i, founded in 1776 b y Adam Weishaupt as an exten- sion of existing Masonic ritual Ten years earlier, Gotthold Lessing had influenced many Germans' opinions on the limits of die arts with his critical treatise, Laoc oõn. The intellectual climate in Germany had reached the point of controversy that in England gave rise to the Hell Fire Club.

Masonic orders have contained the most influential men in many governments, and vi rtually every occult order has many Masonic roots. The rites of the Illum inat i became the basis of the curricu- lum of the later Ordo T empli Orientis, founded in 1902 b y Karl Kellner and Adolf Wilbrandt A similar curriculum, with strong Rosicrucian overtones, was in the English Order of the Golden D aw n in 1887. The teachings of the Illum inat i hold that all is material, that all religions are of hum an invention, that God is man, and man is God, and the world is his kingdom . The Tierdram a reinforces this message. It was first performed by Dieter Hertel in Munich, 31 J uly 1781; the present manuscript dates from 1887. Many authors have written segments of the Litany into literature and dr ama. It is apparent that a great many writers were members of the Order, or of groups which developed from it Vivid examples are to be found i n the works of Arthur Machen, W. B. Yeats, Robert W. Chambers and James Thompson. W orks notable for their reflections of the Tier- dram a are H. G. Wells's most Satanic work, The Island oj Dr. Moreau, which employs portions of the Litany in a masterful sequence; J. V. Widmann's Der Heilige und di e Tiere, a bitter diatribe on the animals' behalf against the Christian god; Carl Hauptmann's Krieg, e in T edeum , in which the animals portray the heads of various European pow ers, and be have no di fferently than hum ans in the long run; and of course George Orwell's Animal Farm and Aldous Huxley's Ape and E ssence. It is likely that Aelister Crowley was familiar with the ceremony, as his Book of the Lav bears a subtle hint in its tide to the credo of the Tierdram a, the Litany of the Law . The message of Nietzsche's Zarathus tra, that advises an identification with the beast as a prerequisite to the role of God-man, is eloquently ritualized in the Tierdram a's Law of the Jungle. It is a lesson too often neglected by \"civilized\" man.

The invocator and the participants wear black robes with open hoods revealing masks in the likenesses of various animals.

Läutet die Glocken von T urm zu Turm! Läutet, dass Funken zu sprühen beginnen ... -Dietrich Eckart If the Tierdram a's theme could be found i n much of the literature and theatre drama of the nineteenth century, Die elektrischen V orspiele's theme could be seen in the science- fantasy cinema of the early twentieth century. The principle of utilizing electrical and m agnetic energy to effect magical ends is sorely neglected by most occult scholars, yet is employed with almost maniacal gusto by the contemporary German school of Satanic magic. As practical applications of electrical energy increased at the turn of the nineteenth century, so did oppo rtunities for neo-promethean innova tion in the field of ritual magic. The German societies Vril, Thul e, F reund en v an L ucifer, Germani a, and Ahnenerbe, while maintaining the basic magic repertoire of the earlier Illum inat i, became what has been loosely defined as the Schvartze Orden- the Black Order- which flourished during the period be tween the two World Wars. Paradoxically, though Freemasonry became anathema during the Nazi regime, virtually every rite of the Black Order employed Masonic principles. In addition to some rites of the German Ordo T empli Orientis which utilized sexual energy as a means of magical transmission, the Black Order rites also used concepts of geometry, utilized reflective planes, paradoxical sound f requen- cies, and atmospheric ionization. Ritual chambers looked like sets from the Schau erfilmen of the period, and indeed they should have, for they were often designed by the same archi- tects. Angles of non-Euclidian incidence and Lovecraftian aspect were prime visual ingredients. Ceremonies like Das W ahsinn d er Logi sch (The Madness of Logic) were Marat/Sade type playlets in which the craziest"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"patients became the asylum heads, using their standards of behavior as criteria in selecting those they deemed mad enough to be safely released into society. The lunatic became a magic influence on those outside the asylum, and controlled people's actions from the safety of confinement. The principles were employed for real-life ends by real-life Caligaris and M abuses . . . and still are. Flashing lights producing stroboscopic effects, electrostatic generators, electric organs with controllable harmonics, scanners, and a mental discipline and emotional response that can tempo- rarily leave its Alpha waves outside the chamber and strive towards Gamma, the ultimate goal: these are the ingredients required for the creation of the is-to-be, as defined in the ritual of the Electrical Prelude-Die elektrischen V orspiele. Many of the rite's principles relate to the experiments of Wilhelm Reich, a name to be reckoned with in the magic of the future. The procedure is to \"charge\" the chamber in a manner that allows the celebrant to \"draw\" energy from it while at the same time he adds his own strength of will. The celebrant's intensity of purpose is further stimulated by the re- lated litany. Upon \" peaking,\" the celebrant enters the reflective planes that will multiply and send forth his will. He remains within the enclosure until he and t he chamber itself is devoid of all energy, and a negative ionization and de ozonization (or in Reichian terminology, DOR) ensues. Requi rements for Performance The ritual may be attended by several persons: however, the essential working is confined to a single celebrant, who acts as the catalyst. Although additional persons can benefit from participation, the celebrant can effectively perform alone. It should be stressed that groups performing Die elektrischen Vorspiele did so with a single purpose, and the presence of several persons therefore added to the effectiveness. The rite, as presented here, was intended to alter an existing social climate and establish far-reaching change. The rite is best performed in a relatively small enclosure, as a large chamber necessitates excessively heavy amounts of electrical discharge in order to attain sufficient ionization. Essentially, the chamber acts as an electrical vacuum tube, with the participants inside it serving as oscillators. A Van de Graaff generator, Tesla coil, or other electrostatic generator, with enough pow er to influence the atmosphere within the chamber, is needed. The device must be exposed, not contained within its own enclosure, hence extreme care must be exercised that bodily contact is not made with the device. It is best placed in an area of the chamber that is inaccessible to persons present to avoid the danger of serious injury or electrocution. The electrostatic generator should produce electrical dis- charge which is readily visible, a lightning display that is con- trolled by the celebrant during the first part of the ritual. In this way he is \"dressing\" the chamber according to his own emotional responses. There is no arbitrary span of time for this segment, as the duration of the preliminary charging period is dependent upon t he size of the enclosure, the extent of electrical discharge, and the hum an response factor. The lightning is controlled from a console or control panel so placed that there can be a change of operators. The celebrant must be able to leave his station, with an assistant to continue at the console, or"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"make beforehand arrangements tot an automated progression. New developments in audio-actuated controls make this a rela- tively simple procedure. Lighting is supplied by argon and neon gas filled tubes with the transformers shielded to prevent extraneous sound f re- quencies. Sound is supplied by some instrument on w hich not only pitch and intensity may be controlled, but individual har- monics, as well, while producing an expanding (sine) wave for the basic tonal pattern. The now-extinct Compton Electrone and Schilder Klavilux were admirably suited, as are larger model Hammond organs and the Moog Synthesizer. Sounds must fluctuate between 60 c ps and 11,000 c ps-preferably \"pure\" tones, although \"resultants\" are permissible. Beneath and above these frequencies should prevail a continuous emission of \"black\" and \"white\" sound, l asting through the entire rite. The chamber should be designed with what might best be described as \"expressionistic\" decor, so that all visual images may add to the out-thrusting quality of the ritual. An altar platform at one end of the chamber should be utilized foe all necessary artifacts. The unclad woman who customarily serves as a living altar is not required in Die elektrishen Vorspiele. In her place, a hum an skull (totenkopf ) rests opon a scarlet cushion. In this ritual as in all other satanic rites, the skull serves as a reminder of the material, flesh-and-bone godhead that is man, rather than as a symbol of mortality. It also repre- sents the vault of wisdom from whence all hitman ideas and developments emerge, the temple of invention, both material and \"spiritual.\" A candlestick bearing a black candle is placed at each side of the skull. The chalice rests directly in front of the skull, with the bell and ph allus to either side. The sword rests parallel to the front edge of the platform. The wall above the altar displays the Sigil of Satan. A pentagonal enclosure, the inside of which is mirrored, serves to receive the celebrant. The pentagon m ust be large enough in diameter and with walls high enough to receive the celebrant's prone body, yet easy to enter and leave. To be practical, the walls of the pentagon should be no hi gher than two feet above the surface of the floor, or if sunken, the floor of the pentagon should be no m ore than that depth beneath the normal floor level. The top edge of the pentagon carries the neon tubing mentioned previously, to mark its bound aries and illuminate its occupant. Directly above the pentagon ha ngs an open, regular trape- zoid, suspended by strong but lightweight cord, so that the slightest force sets it in motion. The hanging trapezoid, con- structed of lightweight material, is wound l ike an induction coil and can be charged just before the ritual begins. The length of the base of the trapezoid is equal to the length of each segment of the pentagon. A stroboscopic light is used to illuminate the celebrant within the pentagon, and the frequency of flash should be whatever is most conducive to the celebrant's needed response. In the past, an arc light with a revolving shutter was used, augmented by a continuous image of flames, projected through the principle of the Lobsterscope. However, now there are vastly improved electronic flash uni ts insofar as controlled frequencies are concerned. Participants wear black ceremonial robes and hoods . The celebrant is bareheaded. When Die elektrischen V orspiele was performed in Nazi"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Germany (circa 1932- 35) by the intellectual element of the buddi ng Sicherheitsdienst RFS, the banners and symbols of the time were used as an integral part of the decor. Participants were garbed in full dress, whether uniformed or not. Topical music was added-usually Morgenrot at the beginning and Unsre Fahn e Flattert uns Voran as a closing anthem. These were played by the organist or on a gramophon e. Music by Richard Wagner may be used instead at the opening and closing of the ritual. The litany spoken by the celebrant paraphrases the Eight h Emerald Tabl et of Thot h (Hermes Trismegistus), in which the Einsteinian time/space continuum is advanced through arcane Greek and Egyptian verbiage. The windows to the fourth dimension are mirrored planes which multiply the image of the single being. Small wonder that the looking glass has had the reputation as a tool of Lucifer, for beyond its use as the most obvi ous plaything of pride, it is a tool to find light where none is thought to exist. The principles of this rite have been recorded in many ways- all similar, yet with nuances unique to each particular order. Versions of the litany in print have catered to the standards of theologically acceptable prose, avoiding what might be offensive to the metaphysically minded. So far as this author has been able to discover, German lodges have kept secret the rites which accompany the spoken hypothesis. It is know n that certain individuals have stumbled upon t hese procedures, employing and expanding upon t hem to great advantage, but, as might be expected, little has been divulged. The instructions given here will serve as a useful key to those who can extract the most viable principles and apply them to their own ends. DIE ELEKTRISCHEN VORSPIELE Procedur e for Performanc e Inasmuch as the litany is recited without interruption after the celebrant enters the pentagon, the working procedure is guided almost entirely by rubrics. 1- The ritual begins in the standard manner, with the purifi- cation, op ening invocation, calling of suitable Infernal Names, partaking of the chalice, invocation of the Four Elements, benediction with pha llus, and calling of the Sixth E nochian Key. 2- Celebrant takes his place at the console, turns on bot h"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"black and white sound s ignals which continue until end of ritual. 3- Begin alternating audible sound a t one second i ntervals (60/11,000 cps). 4- Celebrant activates electrostatic generator until sufficient ozonization and ionization occurs and atmosphere is fully charged. 5- C elebrant activates neon tubing, leaves console. 6- Assistant takes his place at the console, and m aintains audible sound a t one minute intervals during the celebrant's invocation. 7- Celebrant steps into pentagon and delivers invocation, turning counter clockwise very slowly as he speaks. When he completes his invocation, an assistant relieves him of his text and presents the ceremonial sword or dagger. As the celebrant takes the sword in hand, the assistant at the console reactivates the electrostatic generator, combines both audible frequencies in chording, bringing the volume to full intensity, and activates the stroboscopic illumination. 8- Celebrant holds sword on hi gh, turning slowly counter clockwise, pausing at each reflective plane, until nine planes have been confronted. 9- Celebrant lowers himself into pentagon, sword in hand, and assumes the hakenkreuz position while lying on left side, sword in right hand. A t that moment the electrostatic generator is turned off, but sound i s maintained at full intensity and lights are left flashing. Celebrant remains prostrate within the pentagon unt il his vision has been cast. 10- Celebrant rises to his feet inside pentagon. A ssistant at console turns off strobelight, stops 11,000 c ps note completely while maintaining heavy intensity on a sound of combined 30/45/60 cps frequencies, approximating thunde r. Celebrant faces east, lifts sword, and begins the Proclamation, to which the congregants respond, a rms upraised in the Sign of the Horns. 11- A ll lower arms and celebrant or assistant closes ritual in the usual manner, with all console controls off, leaving only candlelight, and closing musical anthem played during pol lu- tionary.

But how much money is required for a ship! He that can und erstand, let him understand. -Grigory Yefimovitch Rasputin Few scholars have explored the existence of Devil worship in Russia during the hund reds of years its pagan spirit was in thrall to the Orthodox Church. If questions were asked, the answer was invariably that Russian black magic was either non- existent or a discipline cloaked in Christian euphemism. The latter assumption is, of course, the most accurate. There is no culture more steeped in dark forces and dei- ties than the Slavonic in general and the Russian in particular. The proportion of Satanic entities in Slavonic mythology far exceeds the usual quot a. What is remarkable is that, unlike die shunn ed forces of darkness so often encountered in myth- ology and religion, R ussian devils were regarded with great reverence and/or enjoyment. For this reason, the Christian Church had a very difficult time fighting the Devil in its Eastern rite. The persistence of Satan, especially among the muzhiks (peasants), in the early days of Russian religious or- thodox y required a revamping of the old gods that made Ro- man Christian transitional techniques pale by comparison. Unable to banish the old gods of Russia by simply turn- ing them into devils (most were benevolent devils, to begin with), the Christian policy makers supplied their own tailor- made Satan as a sort of catchall evil force. The old Russian gods of wrath and pl easure were relieved of any implements with which they might cause trouble, given innocuous tasks, and assigned a day during which they might be allowed a per- functory greeting. Some were forcibly \"forgotten.\" Pyerun, the Formidable One, whose Martian image gave strength and po wer to those in battle, wielded the thunde rbolt by which warriors pledged themselves. His comrade, Volos, the Shaggy One, was the god of the beasts. His snorting stallions and roaring tigers gave inspiration to their two legged brethren. The gentle Christians confiscated Pyerun's chariot and gave him a mill wheel to drag about. His last remaining altar was torn down and thrown into the Dnieper in 988, w hen Prince Vladimir of Kiev decided to convert to Byzantine Orthodox y. Volos suffered the indignity of being turned into a barnyard watchman and simple shepherd, and was assigned the new name of St Vlas. Volkh, the Werewolf King, was the personification of sor- cery, and was called upon b y pagan Russians to defend their land in times of need. The Cult of Kupal a worshipped the magi- cal powers of water. The fern, sacred to the followers of Kupala, like the peacock of the Yezidis, possessed pow er over riches, beautiful women and wisdom. The Cult of larilo refused to die out even as late as the eighteenth century, when the Bishop o f Voronezh abolished its practices, which included organized festivities and \"Satanic games.\" Iarilo, the Russian equivalent of Pan, provided fecun- dity and was particularly hono red in spring during the initial sowing. Zorya, patroness of warriors, rode out on he r black hon e accompanying Pyerun, and offered protection and invisibility beneath her long veil as it trailed in the wind-the wind pro- vided by Stribog, who was also a wrathful deity. Though the dualistic principles common to most primi-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"tive mythology were present in pre-Christian Russian myths, the dark side (Tchomibog) distinctly predominated. The White God, B yelobog (not an enemy of the Black God, in- cidentally; both were considered essential), found g reatest favor in White Russia, where his gentle attributes-he guided lost travelers and helped weary peasants with their work in the fields-were welcome. As was to be expected, the Christians worked overtime to stamp out all such beliefs, thereby placing bot h the simple muzhik, who cherished the good ol d devils, and the educated, in mortal fear of any remnant of dark forces. Thus a Satanic underground t hat was carefully cloaked in Christian trappings was bound t o develop in Russia. Those who entered such sects were either driven by emotion alone (the followers) or by emo- tion and reason (the leaders). By the nineteenth century, religious severity had reached its zenith, with virtually all of Russia adhering to the Orthodox Church. But the Old Gods were preparing a vehicle of retalia- tion: the men of \"God\" were revealed, as in other countries, as the real villains, but they were so steeped in their holy self- righteousness, they were unable to imagine their own disinte- gration. O ut of the morass of \"goodness\" flickered an occa- sional secular spark of \"wickedness.\" These flickerings kept the Old Ones alive. Known erotic religious sects existed in Russia during the eighteenth and ni neteenth centuries, despite the prevailing Or- thodox climate. Evidence indicates they were led and di rected by men whose visionary abilities, practices, and goals revealed them as Satanists of the first order. The sect of the Khlysty demonstrates this more than any other. Their wise men kne w that the passions will always win out . On the surface, the \"holy\" justification of lust and life provided by the priests of the Khlysty seems hypocritical, but it was clearly pragmatic when one understands the religious climate of Russia under the Czars. The Russian religious response has always been kno wn for overt sensualism, and reversals of emotion. Extravagance in ritual has consistently played a substantial role for Russians. And the pattern of roaring, drunken debauch followed by con- trite and anguished repentence was often out side Western comprehension. What were the Khlysty and from where did they come? They first appeared in Russia about the same time as their antagonistic \"separated\" brethren, the Skoptsi or \"castrators\" (circa 1500 ). Their ritual, though Russian, also contained some foreign adaptation. They celebrated in name and deed such ancient gods and pre-Christian divinities as the Rusalki, and Iarilo, who were the personifications of passion and lust, and the Domovoy, or hous e genii. The Khlystys invoke d Bibli- cal gods of pleasure, as well as dark, forboding demons like Balaam, and Persian deities like Kors. In the ritual of these \"seekers after joy\" their whirlings and circumambulations, fol- lowed by frenzied sexual release, were virtually indistinguish- able from the ecstatic flailing about of the Dervishes. Undoubt edly the strongest testimony to the influence of foreign sects upon t he Khlysty was their dogma of \"repentance through sin\"-the proposition that physical intercourse with a \"divine\" or chosen one (one in whom a god or the flame of god dwelt) would abolish and transform sin into virtue. This doctrine has overt resemblance to and varies only slightly from one preached by the Brethren of the Free Spi rit in France,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Germany and Czechoslovakia in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Brethren of the Free Spi rit was a sect of dissi- dents that miscarried from the womb of its Mother Roman Church. They taught that within each hum an being there dwelt a little divine spark (Fünklein). They believed that a simple recognition of this magical essence within each man was enough to liberate one from any restrictions whatsoever, whether social, sexual or intellectual. The Russian has been, throughout history, predominantly receptive, though sometimes quixotic And despite the con- temporary myth of classlessness, he can easily find hi s place and remain reconciled to it. Intrigue and change have always hailed from alien spheres. The doctrine of the little flame was, therefore, easily adapted to fit the Russian \"soul.\" Instead of fifty lesser gods of a congregation realizing their divinity, one human leader became divine. To this master, or leader, all bowed with devotion. He was the one who would deliver them from sin! Along with this went the use of a transmogri- fied Orthodox liturgical format, persistently forming a cross- current in the rituals. Associated with this phenomenon i s the Russian Master and convenient villain, Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin, the \"Mad Monk\" who, through the strength of his personality, and in- cantations of a rather dubi ous nature, succeeded in assuaging the hemophilic attacks of the Czarevich, thereupon i ngratiating himself into the inner workings of the Czar's court The Khlysty have received much of their notoriety through the sup- posed association with Rasputin. Though scores of books have been written about him, only one, the perceptive biography by Colin Wilson, seems to paint an accurate picture. If one has sufficient insight, the publ ished memoirs of Rasputin's daugh- ter, Maria, also prove enlightening. The qualities Rasputin possessed will one day become the very stuff from which con- trolled hum an greatness will be sought-the sort of greatness that moves man forward in his evolutionary development. In Rasputin some saw that greatness and felt its effect in ways they could not understand, w ays that summoned the pain of their own inadequacy. Because he used this inner mechanism, this built-in \"inadequacy detector,\" Rasputin made many enemies, along with many sycophants. It is significant to note that the persons who brought Rasputin to St. Petersburg and introduced him to court were no m ean or feeble occultists, but prominent members of Church aristocracy and urban intelligentsia. Dilettantes and saints (notably, John of Cronstadt) alike hailed him as a holy man with pow ers from God (Yet after his death they condemned him as a devil.) Accounts of his out ré propensities and hi s powers flourished. It was claimed that a bluish emanation was seen to issue from his lips. He was credited with an uncanny ability to perceive the thoughts and hi dden emotions of others. This is borne out by his own words, which also refute the claims of his discreditors who often include thievery among his \"vices.\" His daughter, Maria, recalls him saying, \"I never dared to steal or pilfer the smallest thing. I used to believe that everybody would at once see that I had stolen something, since I myself was aware of it as soon a s one of my comrades had stolen.\" His accomplishments in healing were recognized and widely known, yet not his methods, for Rasputin's was not the usual shamanism of the faith healer. His suppos edly extravagant de- bauchery and libidinous life have been the subject of countless"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"prurient ravings, as has his non- existent role in the Khlysty as leader-redemptor of throngs of living bodi es. That Rasputin became involved in a political cabal is not to be doubt ed. He was compelling and out going, yet unaffected, in spite of his theatrics, and probably had a high level of natural intelligence. Little is known, how ever, of the secret meetings held on \" special nights\" of the year, to which onl y a few select members, both noble and peasant, were summoned-those evenings that are alluded to but never quite discussed, when Rasputin was \"the flame in red\" and the \"great working\" was done. When Alexandra, the Empress of Russia, was executed in the cellar of the Ipatiev hous e in 1918, t wo years after the cruel murder of her bat iuska Grigori, the guards made a unique discovery. While searching for jewels among her possessions, they found s ewn into her bodi ce a pair of small emerald green dragons given to her by Rasputin many years before. Could he have trafficked with the odd h ermetic order which fringed the Russias, The Green D ragon? There are also many specula- tions about the true motivations of the fin de siècle Khlysty movement. Oral communication and fraternal legacy have made the following rite available. Requi rements for Performance Participants consist of a priest (celebrant), the woman who serves as altar, two acolytes, an illuminator, a gong-striker, and the congregation. The priest wears a red robe with full sleeves. His assistants are garbed in black robes with red cinctures around t he waist. The altar is nude and wears only a metal crown with four lighted candles around i ts edge. Male congregants wear Russian style tunics over black trousers tucked into black boot s. Female congregants wear diaphanous fabric of muted hues, represent- ing the misty veils of the Rusalki. A chained thurible with which to cense the altar and the artifacts is required, as is a large brazier. A small vial of flash pow der is placed next to the brazier. The powder is thrown into the brazier according to the rubric. A hum an arm or leg bone is used as an aspergeant, in honor of Kashchey, the skeleton god. All other devices common to Satanic ritual are employed. The altar sits in a semicircle of ferns, arranged in a fan effect. The chamber is lighted by candles and is decorated in Byzantine motif. Musical background s hould be carefully cued to the service, using either Russian folk instruments or suitable re- cordings. The tiny bells typical of Russian liturgical ceremony should be used wherever appropriate to the rite, and pl ayed in the rhythm associated with the Obikhod. If in doubt , Mo- deste Mussorgsky or Walt Disney can be your guides.

From their mecca-the tomb of their first leader, Sheik Adi-situated on M ount Lalesh near the ancient city of Nine- veh, the Yezidi empire stretched in an invisible band approxi- mately three hund red miles wide to the Mediterranean junction of Turkey and Syria on on e end, and the mountains of the Caucasus in Russia on the other. At intervals along this strip were seven towers-the Towers of Satan (Ziarahs)-six of them trapezoidal in form, and one , the \"center\" on M ount Lalesh, shaped like a sharp, fluted poi nt. Each tower was topped by a brilliant heliographic reflector, and was intended to serve as a \"power hous e\" from whence a Satanic magician could beam his will to the \"descendants of Adam,\" and influence hum an events in the outside world. Like the Watchers-the fallen angels of the Book o f Enoch-the Yezidis claimed to be the descendants of Azazel. The Yezidis believed in a counterpart of the story of Lucifer, i.e. the manifestation of pride banished. Like the legendary lost tribes of Israel, the Yezidis broke away from their roots as a result of unresolved conflicts, and felt a strong justification and pu rpose because of their unique heritage, which theo- logically isolated them from all other peoples. The Yezidis' legend of their origin is no longer fantastic, by scientific standards. It alludes to the creation of the first male and female of the tribe through the principles later set down by Paracelsus for the creation of a hom unculus;"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"viz. encapsulation of sperm in a container where it gestates and assumes a hum an embryonic form. The Yezidi provided a link between Egypt, Eastern Eu- rope, and Tibet. The language of the Yezidis was Kurdish- similar in sound t o Enochian, the language suppos edly spoken by the Watchers. Shortly before Sheik Adi (full name: Saraf ad-Din Abu-l- Fadail, Adi ben Musafir ben Ismael ben Mousa ben Marwan ben Ali-Hassan ben Marwan) died in 1163, h e dictated what was to become one of the most legendary manuscripts of all time-the Al-Jilwah (revelations). The Al-Jilwah, combined with the Mashaf Rei, which was compiled in the following century, became know n as the Black Book - the words spoken by Satan to his people. The Black Book not only contains the credo of the Yezidi, but their rites as welL The Yezidis entered their temples through portals bearing the images of a lion, snake, doubl e sided axe, man, comb, scissors, and m irror. The lion represented strength and do - minion; the snake, procreation; the axe, potential for good or harm; the man, the god; and the comb, scissors and m irror rep- resented pride. But greater as a symbol of pride, how ever, was the form taken by Satan in the Yezidi liturgy-the peacock. Because they could not utter the name of Satan (Shaitan) for fear of persecution, the name Melek Taus (Peacock King) was used. So great was the risk of outside persecution, that even words that sounde d vaguely like the name Sat an were forbidden. The vestiges of Yezidi culture that remain today have, as might be expected, met with not only maudlin \"understand- ing\" but, worse yet, attempts to whitewash the religion and deny that it was Devil worship. After eight centuries of harm- ing no one , minding their own bus iness, and m aintaining the courage of their convictions-despite wholesale massacres of their men, women, and children at the hands of the self-right- ous-the Yezidis have finally been granted a sickeningly charit- able form of acknowledgment from theologians. It is now patronizingly asserted that the Yezidis were \"actually nobl e and hi ghly moral people,\" and therefore could not ac tual ly have worshipped the Devil! It is difficult to assess this as anything other than the most blatant form of selective in- attention! Each time an important Yezidi ritual was to take place, a brazen figure of a peacock (called a sanj ak) was removed from a secret hiding place by a priest and carried to the temple. It was placed on a pedestal around w hich a running spring of water played into a small pooL This served as the shrine and icon towards which hom age was directed. The water suppos edly came from an und erground s tream which flows through subterranean caverns in a network ope ning under each Tower of Satan. The point of origin of these streams was thought to be the miraculous well of Islam know n as Zamzam. The caverns suppos edly terminated at the place of the Masters-Schamballah (Carcosa). In order to establish proper perspective, in addition to the Yezidis' own beliefs concerning the caverns and the effects of the Towers of Satan, the conjectures of outsiders must be mentioned here. It has long been assumed that the Towers were not limited to the Yezidi geography, but loomed in un- recognized forms in various parts of the world as diverse struc- tures-with each serving as a surface marker for an entrance, allegorical or otherwise, to the nether world. Thus considered,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"the Yezidi Towers and the Satanic influence they contained become a microcosm of a far more portentous network of control. The \"clans\" of the Yezidis consisted of: Sheikan, at Mount Lalesh; Sinjar (Eagle's Lair), in Kurdistan; Halitiyeh, in Turkey; Malliyeh, on the Mediterranean; Sarahdar, in Georgia and Southern Russia; Lepcho, in India and Tibet; and the Kotchar, who, like the Bedouins, moved about with no permanent sector. The Yezidi interpretation of God was in the purest Satanic tradition. The idea, so prominent in Greek phi losophy, that God is an existence absolute and complete in himself, un- changeable, outside of time and space, did not exist in Yezidi theology. Also rejected was the theocratic Judaic concept of Jehovah, and also the Mohammedan God: the absolute ruler. The notion, unique to Christians, that God is Christ-like in character was totally absent. If there was any semblance of a personal manifestation of God, it was through Satan, who instructed and guided the Yezidi toward an und erstanding of the multifaceted principles of Creation, much like the Platonic idea that the Absolute was itself static and transcendental. This concept of \"God\" is essentially the position taken by the more highly evolved Satanists. Prayer was forbidden, in the strictest Satanic tradition. Even daily expressions of faith were referred to as \"recitals.\" Few outsiders had ever penetrated the sanctuaries of the Yezidis. The exceptions have been almost exclusively within the past century when, unf ortunately, the sect was waning as an organized movement. Fewer had glimpsed the sacred san- jaks or seen the manuscript of the Black Book , for they were carefully guarded from the descendants of Adam, whose progeny had filled the world with mindless clay. Only four texts of the Black Book exist, other than the original. One is in Arabic (called the Carshuni text), two are in Syriac (with respective French and Italian translations), and the Church of Satan's present text, translated from the Arabic manuscript of Daud as-Saig by Isya Joseph. During the early 1920 's writer William Seabrook v en- tured into the desert and climbed Mount Lalesh, recording his journey (Adventures in Arabi a) with an obj ectivity that proved him to be a brave yet compassionate man. At a time when it was literary fashion to trounce the Devil for good measure, regardless of his attributes, Seabrook's affinity for Satan was visible in all his writing as surely as if he had been a Bierce, Shaw, Twain, or Wells. He was one of the few outsiders who, for the first time in the Yezidi his- tory, showed sympathy for their Devil. By now the Yezidis have largely been absorbed into the world of \"those without,\" but their influence has taken effect. That influence has been manifest, throughout Satanism's underground p eriod, in the procedures of virtually every secret brotherhood s ince the Knights Templar, and in countless liter- ary works. Now, after the often tragic epic of the Yezidis has become history, it is safe to pronoun ce the Dread Name.

The congregants enter the chamber and seat themselves on pi llows placed on t he floor in a semicircle facing the shrine of Melek Taus. The water runs over the rocks surroundi ng the sanjak and into a pool at their base. Incense burns in braziers at each side of the shrine. The kawwals (musicians) stand against the rear wall of the temple, playing a prelude on flutes, drums, and tambourines. (Note: As emotional response is essential during certain segments of the rite, Europeans and Americans may require music of a modified form. There is much to be recommended in the works of Borodin, Cut, Rimsky- Korsakoff, Ketelbey, Ippolitov-Ivanov, etc., despite the sneers of \"purists.\") The priest enters, followed by his assistants, all wearing black robes and red cinctures of braided cord. The priest stands before the shrine, his assistants on either side. The priest's head is shaven. The razor used for this was first washed in the magical waters of Zamzam. All music stops, and the gong is struck once. The flute resumes playing, very slowly and softly, and the priest invoke s the Third Enochian Key (from The Sat ani c Bible). When he has finished, the flute stops, and, following a pause, the gong is again struck. The flute begins to play, as before, and the priest recites from the Al-]ilwah, the Black Book .

T H E M ETA P H Y S I C S O F L O V E C R A F T Even to his most intimate acquaintances, Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937) remained frustratingly enigmatic. From the pen of this ingenious New Englander came a collection of the most convincing and thoroughly terrifying works of macabre fiction in modern times. His tales were uniquely em- bellished with painstaking pseudo-documentation and m eticu- lous description of character and setting. It is frequently said"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"that, once one has read Lovecraft, one disdains the efforts of the competition. This statement has been consistently difficult to refute. As might be expected, Lovecraft was lionized and ex- tensively imitated by a num ber of writers whose imaginations were sparked by his celebrated \"Cthulhu mythos\"-a term com- monly given to a series of stories based upon a supernatural pantheon of Lovecraft's own invention. He had a firm con- viction that reference to the classical mythologies would under- mine the atmosphere of cyclic and spatial disorientation he sought to create. Lovecraft created his own beings, whose pre- historic activities on E arth set in motion the forces of man's civilization and genius, as well as the horrors of his educated imagination. While Freud and Einstein wrestled with their respective disciplines in the isolation of academic specialization, Lovecraft was describing the astonishing influence of physical and geometric law on the psyche. While he might have hesi- tated to style himself a master of scientific speculation, he a no less deserving of that title than are Asimov and Clarke. What has puzzled many of Lovecraft's admirers is the author's almost casual attitude towards his work. He repeatedly referred to it as a mere means of financial subsistence. To peo- ple who suspected that he entertained a private belief in the mythos, he would reply that an obj ective detachment from one's material was necessary for effective writing. He was wont to mention the most nightmarish of his narratives with a levity bordering upon s corn, as though he did not consider them of genuine literary substance. As an author, Lovecraft enjoys an established reputation, but what of Lovecraft the philosopher? Perhaps the most significant clues to the philosophy in the Cthulhu mythos derive from the author's fascination with hu- man history, particularly that of the classical eras. That much of his work used material taken from Egyptian and Arabian legends is well know n. There is evidence that he was acutely aware of civilization's effects upon m ankind-both educational and repressive. His tales constantly remind the reader that humanity is but a short step from the most depraved and vicious forms of bestiality. He sensed man's drive toward knowledge, even at the risk of sanity. Intellectual excellence, he seemed to say, is achieved in concert with cataclysmic terror -not in avoidance of it. This theme of a constant interrelationship between the con- structive and de structive facets of the hum an personality is the keystone of the doctrines of Satanism. Theism argues that the integrity of the individual can be increased by a rejection of the carnal and an obedience to morality. Lovecraft recorded bis aversion to conventional religious dogma in The Si lver Key, and he regarded with a similar scorn those who, rejecting religion, succumbed to a controversial substitute, i.e. the popul ar notion of witchcraft. The concept of worship per se is strik- ingly absent from the Cthulhu mythos. Nyarlathotep, Shub- Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu are all honor ed through bizarre festivals, but their relationship to their followers is in- variably that of teacher to students. Compare the description of a Lovecraftian ceremony to that of a Christian mass or a Voodoo r ite, and it is clear that the element of servility is definitely lacking in the first. Lovecraft, like the Miltonian Satan, chose to reign in Hell rather than to serve in Heaven. His creatures are never conclusive stereotypes of good or evil; they vacillate constantly between beneficence and cruelty. They respect knowledge, for"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"which the protagonist of each story abandons every prudent restraint Critics who consider the Old Ones as Aristotelian elementals-or as a collective influence of malignancy which man must destroy if he is to prevail-suggest a philistine dis- position. Lovecraft, if he tolerated such analyses, can hardly have been impressed by them. Assuming that Lovecraft was an advocate of Satanic amorality, what might have been the content of the ritual ob- servances in Innsmouth, R'lyeh, or Leng? In his work he only goes as far as an occasional lurid line from some \"nameless rite\" or \"unspeakable orgy\" celebrated by grotesque apparitions amidst sulphurous caverns of fluorescent, decaying fungi, or against titanic monoliths of disturbing aspect. Perhaps he thought understatement to be more effective in freeing the imaginations of his readers, but clearly, he had been influenced by very real sources. Whether his sources of inspiration were consciously recognized and admitted or were a remarkable \"psychic\" absorption, one can onl y speculate. There is no doubt that Lovecraft was aware of rites not quite \"nameless,\" as the allusions in his stories are often identical to actual cere- monial procedures and nom enclature, especially to those prac- ticed and advanced around t he turn of the last century. The Innsmouths and Arkhams of Lovecraft have their counterparts in seaside hamlets and forlorn coastal areas all over the world, and on e has but to use his senses to spot them: the Land's End sector of San Francisco; Mendocino on the Northern California coast; from the Hamptons to Montauk in New York; between Folkestone and Dover on the English Channel; the Cornish coast west of Exmouth, and numerous points along the coast of Brittany in France. The list is endless. Where men have stood a t earth's end contemplat- ing the transition from sea to land with mingled fear and long- ing in their hearts, the lure of Cthulhu exists. Any offshore oil drilling pl atform or \"Texas tower\" is a potential altar to the Spawn of the Watery Abyss. Lovecraft seems to have correlated the monsters of the canvasses of a hund red Pickmans-the great Symbolist painters of the 1890 's-into a twentieth century scenario. His fantasies may well have been a conscious projection of the idea ex- pressed so eloquently by Charles Lamb in his Witches and Other Night Fears: \"Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition-but they were there before. They are transcripts, types-the archetypes are in us, and eternal.\" One cannot help speculating upon a reality suggested by the fantasy-the possibility that the Old Ones are the spectres of a future hum an mentality. It is as the result of such specu- lation that The Ceremony of the Nine Angl es and The Call to C thui hu are presented. One emphasizes potential: the other reflects the dimness of an almost forgotten past. As for the phon etics, they bear no linguistic given name.

The single exception is that all participants must wear the medallion that bears the Seal of Satan: it may be dangerous to disregard this provision. A large bonfire is kindled.

T H E S A TA N I C BA P TI S M S Since the formation of the Church of Satan, many persons wishing to solemnize their newly acknow ledged dedication to Satanic principles have requested a \"baptismal\" rite, whereby they might utilize an established form of religious observance for more compatible beliefs. As a result, two distinct ceremonies have been created, one for infants and the other for adults who have reached the legal age of consent. Of course any ceremony performed for an infant is not really performed for the child, but for the parents. With this thought in mind, a baptism in the traditional sense could serve no productive purpose by Satanic standards. A child's \"bap- tism\" according to Satanic tenets must, therefore, be in the nature of a celebration, rather than a purification. In this sense, a Satanic \"baptism\" for children becomes a Christian baptism in reverse. Instead of cleansing the infant of \"original sin\" and preparing him for a life of blind devotion to an existing faith, the Satanic \"baptism\" pays hom age to the miracle of the child's creation, his capacity for unbefouled development and hi s free- dom from hypocrisy."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The children's ceremony included here is intended for children und er the age of four; beyond that age ideas alien to Satanic development have been absorbed into the child's mind, via the formal teachings of older and of ten unw iser hum ans. Once that process has begun, onl y the individual can thereafter rightfully choose a credo for himself and formalize it. Hence, the need for a Satanic \"baptismal\" rite for adults. \"Legal age of consent\" is essential to the adult's ceremony, because of the doubl e-edged sword that term provides. Environ- mental legislation contends-rightly or otherwise-that when a person reaches a certain chronological age he is capable of managing his own affairs and m aking his own decisions. It is assumed that any such decisions are a by-product of his mental and emotional development, the result of both heredity and environment. This behavioral composite is also influenced by what is referred to as \"proper guidance\" or \"improper guid- ance,\" depending upon w ho is speaking. Attainment of legal age enables one to \"misguide\" himself as he sees fit, and to assume the blame or take the credit for his own actions. Inasmuch as all Satanists would be considered \"misguided\" by the pious, we have no w ish to offend further the sensibilities of the self-righteous by luring apple-cheeked boys and girls into \"unholy rites and uns peakable orgies.\" Virtually every unsuc- cessful (usually deservedly so) contemporary sect or cult which has deviated from established Christian dogma has fallen because the pious majority has been out raged by said cult's traffic with underaged persons. Admittedly, many of these cults have been little more than confidence games, or sexual outlets, cloaked in white-light spirituality. While we concur that age is no proof of sound j udgment, we recognize the importance of working within the legal framework of society. There is nothing inherently wrong with morality: in fact it is necessary for the great enjoyment which comes with con- trolled, rational, and harmless immorality. What is objection- able, though, is a morality based on obs olete and exhausted principles. The children's \"baptism\" set forth here rejoices in the infant's intrinsic freedom from such expendable principles. The adult's baptism celebrates the individual's rejection of those precepts and hi s subsequent adherence to Satanic ethic. What, it will be asked, will young readers, whose ages fall between the two baptisms, do to commit themselves to Satan- ism? The answer is that whether you are right or wrong, your beliefs will not be held valid by those outside unless money can be made on them. If enough of you believe in the principles of Satanism, they will find ways of making money on your faith. Then, without realizing it, they will have contributed to Lucifer's rise by making popul ar what once was shunned as evil. Your faith in Satanism need not be formalized by baptism in order to work its magic Your faith need onl y be outspokenly stated. That is what you can do. THE SATANIC \"BAPTISM\" Adult Rite"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Participants include: the priest or acting priest, the initiate(s), any assistants who m ay be required by the priest, and ot her selected witnesses present by invitation of the initiate, but whose presence is not a prerequisite for the performance of this ceremony. Accouterments are all those standard to Satanic Ritual as described in The Sat ani c Bible, plus a receptacle with earth and on e with sea water, and a brazier and charcoal, and incense. Participants are appareled in the customary manner, i.e. black ceremonial robes and (except for priest) peaked, full-faced hoods , and amulets bearing the Symbol of Baphom et. The ceremony commences with the initiate barefoot, robed in white, wearing no und ergarments. An additional black robe and Baphom et amulet will be needed for the initiate later in the ceremony and therefore should be prepared and pl aced nearby. Before formally entering the chamber, participants don appropriate vestments, arrange artifacts and implements conveniently but without sacrifice of magical correctitude: the brazier, the initiate's chair or stool, and the receptacles containing soil and sea water are placed near altar. Light the altar candles and the candle to be used by the priest during the ceremony (Black Flame), ignite charcoal, and complete all other preparations. Then begin appropriate music. Upon e ntering the chamber, the priest (or celebrant acting in that capacity) assumes his position before the altar. The initiate and the other participants stand to either side, with the priest's assistants positioned as their respective roles require. Preliminary functions of ritual are performed in customary order. The initiate is then called forward and kn eels before the priest, who recites the First Enochian K ey (from The Sat ani c Bible) and proceeds to address the initiate. PRIEST: In the majestic light of unde filed wisdom, awake and enter into the Arcadian Wood wherein all thy lingering falsehoods shall be as dead bark, stripped from thy trunk: where thy futile hypocrisies, known and unkno wn, shall no longer envelop thee in mind and bod y.

We toll the bell in Thy name and thereby summon the whispering voices of wonder from all the regions of Thine Empire. Breathe of His breath, O brother of the night, and nou rish thy warning brain. From the despair and agony of thy former direction, thy new path is tonight set forth in all the brilliance of Lucifer's flame. His zephyrs now guide thy steps into the ultimate power which knowledge brings. The blood of those who fail is eternally bright on the jaws of Death, and the hounds of night pursue their hapless quarry relentlessly. They who walk amongst us who bear deceit: verily they shall perish in blindness. Turn thy back on t he vile and despise them: follow the Black Flame to unending beauty in mind and bod y. [Priest removes some earth from container and, w hile pressing the soil back and forth against the initiate's soles and palms, speaks:] PRIEST: Now, as before, when the Mother of us all cushioned out paths with the pure pagan silt of ages, She offers Herself anew. As thy true role of Earth-child emerges and pervades thy being, return for this and all time thy feet to Her bosom. Revel in the shimmering glow from the hearth of thy heart, and m ake thy pact of devotion with all Her children whose paws have tracked and learned the way of Belial.

T H E S A TA N I C \" BA P TI S M \" Children's Ceremony To Zeena and O rwell Participants consist of a priest, an assistant, the child who is to be glorified, and the child's parents. Other congregants may be present at the invitation of the child's parents. Black robes are worn by all participants except the child, who wears a bright red gown with open-faced hood. The talisman of Satan is suspended by a chain or ribbon worn around t he neck on t he outside of the red gown. The child is seated (or lain, if a very young infant) upon the altar platform before the symbol of Satan, depicted on"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"the west wall of the chamber. In addition to the accouterments standard to Satanic Ritual (see The Sat ani c Bible), earth and sea water, and an appropriate receptacle for each, will be needed. It should be noted that incense is not employed in this rite. The use of incense is so firmly entrenched in secular religious pro- cedure-an aspect of life not yet know n to the child-that establishing such an identification with Satanic rite in the child's mind is unm agical. Though adults seem to require it, children don 't. If scents are to be present within the chamber, they should be odors for which the child has dis- played favorable or elated response, such as chocolate, warm milk, or other favorite food, a n animal pet, etc. Background m usic must be carefully selected, as small children are epicurean in their choice of tonalities. The author has found t hat the themes of Edvaard Grieg's \"Hall of the Mountain King\" and Gabriel Pierné's \"En- trance of the Little Fauns,\" when played at a slow and even tempo, are ideal. Archaic English (thee, thy, etc.) has been eliminated from this rite because of the possibility of confusion to the child, for it is reasonable to assume he is unaccustomed to such verbiage at the age of his taking the rite. If the child's parents are made happier by archaic usage, substitu- tions can be made. The priest stands direcdy in front of the altar, his assistant to his left, and the child's parents to his right. The ceremony is begun in the standard manner. The priest reads the First Enochian Key (from The Sat ani c Bible), then proceeds with the glorification: PRIEST: In the name of Satan, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan, and all the demons, named and nameless, walkers in the velvet darkness, harken to us, O dim and shadowy things, wraith-like, twisted, half-seen creatures, glimpsed beyond the foggy veil of time and spaceless night. Draw near, attend us on this night of fledgling sovereignty. Welcome a new and worthy sister (brother), (child's name) , creature of ecstatic, magic light. Join us in our welcome.

[The acolyte hands a lighted black candle to the priest, who pa sses the flame four times under the child's feet, saying:] PRIEST: In the name of Satan, we set your feet upon t he Left-Hand Path. Four times above the flame you pass, to kindle lust and passion in your heart, that the heat and brightness of Schamballah's flame may warm you, that your feelings and emotions may burn bright and passionate, to work your magic as you wish.

W e call your name into the night: O hear sweet (name)'s magic name. [Returning the bell to the acolyte, the priest is given the earth jar. He removes a small amount of earth and lightly rubs it against the child's hands and feet (palms and soles), saying:] PRIEST: In the name of Belial, we place His mark upon y ou, to solemnize and etch in memory the dark, moist planet-the Pit from whence you came-the jetting stream of manhood f ertiliz- ing Mother Earth.

May all the dwellers in the watery abyss smile upon y ou, (name), and swirl about you lovingly. May the oceans surge an anthem to your glory, O little spawn of briny heritage.

[The ceremony is concluded in the usual manner.] T H E U N K N O WN K N O WN Despite others' attempts to identify a certain num ber with Satan, it will be known that Nine is His num ber. Nine is the number of the Ego, for it always returns to itself. No matter what is done through the most complex multiplication of Nine by any other num ber, in the final equation nine alone will stand forth. The true ages of time are cast in the likeness of Nine, with all cycles obedient to its Law. All matters of terrestrial concern may be evaluated by the infallible resolution of Nine and its offspring. Action and reaction relative to hum anity's tribal needs are contained within successive nine-year periods: the total of both (eighteen years) is called a Working. The begin- ning and end of each Working is called a Working Year, and each midway point between the Working Years displays a zenith of intensity for the Working which has been brought about. Nine eighteen-year Workings equal an Era (162 y ears). Nine Eras equal an Age (1,458 y ears), which has been mis- takenly called a millennium. Nine Ages equal an Epoch (13,122 y ears). Each Age (1,458 y ears) alternates as Fire or Ice, each differing in the means by which the Control presents its dictum. During an Age of Ice, man is taught to refrain from his pride and to retreat from himself; then he will be good. D uring an Age of Fire, man is taught to indulge himself and to tear himself open and look inside; then he will be good. D uring an Ice Age, God is above. During a Fire Age, God is beneath. Throughout each Age, big things occur each eighteen years, for the Control must maintain a cycle of action and reaction within the greater cycle of Fire and Ice. Meaningful and po rtentous messages are cast forth each eighteen years, and are acted upon f or the eighteen years which follow, at the end of which a new statement appears. The Ice Age from which we recently emerged began in the year 508 \"A.D.\" Just as the zenith of passion for what each Working has inspired occurs halfway between the Working Years, so the greatest intensity of each Age's message occurs at its midpoint. Thus in the year 1237 \" A.D.\" man's fervor for what the last Ice Age represented had reached its summit. That Age ended in 1966, a nd the new Age of Fire was born. The twentieth century has prepared us for the future and the coming of the Age of Fire was well heralded in the last Working Years of the Ice Age.
