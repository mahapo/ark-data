[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - The Heroic Society (his vision) Don Webb Recently I was offered a lot of money for some of my writing. I had to turn it down because I had already given my word to sell the article to someone else for a pittance. An acquaintance told me, \"I thought you should have taken the bucks!\" \"I gave my word\", I said. \"I thought you were a Satanist\". \"I am a Satanist.\" Then I realized my acquaintance would never be a Sata nist. He didn't Understand that we neither lie nor cheat - and that the use of Lesser Black Magic is to move zombies out of our way when all else fails. If you Understand that, then something of our word reaches you. Let's consider the Heroic Society: 1. In an Heroic Society inequality is recognized as a fact -- not to bring about stagnation but to encourage a constant striving on the part of all. 2. In an Heroic Society the state would not be idealized. There would be discord -- since as we sought out Higher Selves these Selves would not always have the same goals -- but discord would be tempered with respect. 3. In an Heroic Society evil would not be perpetuated. Repeat offenders of the laws the current society holds so dear (rapists, murderers, child abusers, drug dealers) would be put to death. Repeat offenders who force their culture and religion upon others (q.v. Aleister Crowley Liber Oz) would suffer the same fate. 4. In an Heroic Society aid would flow freely to those attempting great quests. The government wouldn't sponsor the arts, and PBS wouldn't have those endless telethons. 5. In an Heroic Society excellence would be recognised as the goal. Athletic or intellectual or spiritual excellence would be the goal. This does not mean the weak are to be despised -- when the 'business as usual' society has faded away, each man and each woman will strive to Become more than they seem. 6. In an Heroic Society nothing guarantees excellence. You don't get it through being born to a certain race, belonging to a certain creed (even Satanism!), being a certain sex. The physically challenged person who overcomes his/her handicap is a prime example of a Hero. 7. In an Heroic Society isolate intelligence -- the Black Flame -- is prized above all things. Sellers of drugs (legal and illegal), purveyors of numbing entertainment, preachers of individuality-denying systems will disappear as nightmares in the dawn of reason. 8. In an Heroic Society one will seek after the mysteries. We will celebrate"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and Understand the transcendental moments of ALL cultures. Not through some crystal-counter 'channeling', but with a careful interplay of real research (archaeology/anthropology) and mystic insight from the talented among us. We will study all, accept all, but we will revel unabashed in the pride of our own ancestral streams. The honour of all mankind will be Remanifest in an Heroic Society. 9. In an Heroic Society we will explore OurSelves and find the full range of our voices. By being true to ourSelves rather than to a cultural norm (or god), our acts are freed from the heavy burden of claims of universality, eternality, and absoluteness -- such total ponderous oneness with the natural order -- our work becomes sparkling, free and joyous. The hero speaks with the justified voice â€“ the Ma'at Kheru -- and his Word changes the worlds. This is Setnakt's vision. If it is yours -- take it into the depths of yourSelf -- and cast it upon the world with the strongest of your magical might! Magic can be in every intentional act. Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
