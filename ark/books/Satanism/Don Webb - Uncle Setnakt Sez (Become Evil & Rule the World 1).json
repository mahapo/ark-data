[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Uncle Setnakt Sez - Become Evil and Rule the World:1 Don Webb It's the Silver Anniversary of Satanism. We see Indulgence -- albeit unconscious – in all levels of our society, and we are beginning to see Xeper manifest in the world. So it's time we took seriously the task of becoming evil to rule the World. 1. Develop a strong memory. This will aid in a variety of Lesser and Greater Black Magic endeavors. In Lesser Black Magic (LBM) we know that leadership comes from position (you're the foreman and everyone listens to you), charisma (you've got a forceful personality or looks), or knowledge (you're the one everyone consults). Developing memory, which is largely a matter of practice, will open that third position. Become group historian. You'll be surprised at the control you have by simply remembering what was said, done, or what you read. As historian others will seek you to be sure you know their side of things, which provides a tremendous opportunity for manipulation. Finally, when your memory/knowledge becomes accepted as an authority, you can manipulate the past for your own best interests. The Greater Black Magic (GBM) uses of memory are beyond the scope of this essay. The accomplished magicians out there know what I mean -- for the beginners, developing memory for GBM is like developing leg muscles for ballet. 2. Develop a thick skin. Don't get me wrong you can smite people on the other cheek all you want. Effective revenge requires intelligence and information about your target. Learn to let things bounce off. This way when your revenge comes, it comes from an unexpected source you strike at an undefended area. Likewise – if you're a snake in the grass -- people will be careless around you. They won't watch what they say or reveal. Of course, putting off your revenge will give you time to reconsider. Perhaps the offender did his work out of stupidity rather than malice. Do not take revenge against the stupid. It is beneath you. Instead discover how to make the stupid one your tool. This not only saves energy (magical and otherwise) but increases your sphere of control in the world. 3. Develop instant sanctuaries. The Black Magician is in a state of constant stress. She is moving apart from the stream of the world. She has recognized and works with change as part of her being. To keep from wilting under the pressure, she needs retreats -- points of rest and preservation. The Satanist must live strategically -- if it is a helpful metaphor, consider the world as a battlefield. Sanctuaries can be a safe place at work, a song invested with special meaning, or a picture of the wife and kids. It can be anything that enables you to gather your forces and renew your focus. In the middle of a campaign you can shift your attention briefly to the sanctuary. Draw in a quiet cold breath (as though from the very womb of Hel) and return refreshed. Be content in your knowledge that your opponent lacks such places of power. Magicians wishing to explore the concepts of rest and preservation in a world of change are referred to Alvin"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Toffler's Future Shock and Eric Hoffer's The Ordeal of Change. 4. Recognize and align yourself with Aeonic currents. The word of the Aeon is Xeper -- come into being. As the new Aeon itself comes into being, historical and political forces will also come into being. Certain cultural artifacts appear with a predisposition to individualism (such as the skateboard and the personal computer). If you seek out these phenomena not only will your personal Xeper grow as you WORK (and work) with them -- the phenomena will in turn be empowered by your touch. And as the Aeon grows your connections with its external manifestations will move you into a position where you can influence the world more and more. Certain manifestations of Xeper which are visible. social therapy changing from total care to empowerment, the ending of collectivist/communistic systems, the development of drugs and therapies to increase one's active/effective life by decades, the growing availability of expert knowledge through the computer net. Magicians interested in Aeonic history may wish to consult S. Edred Flower's latest book, Fire And Ice. Even if you can't work with these things -- marvel at them, for Wonder stirs the GBM latent in everyone's soul. 5. Recognize and dismantle Aeonic hindrances. As a new Aeon comes in, the old has a dying rush of activity. Examples of this can be found in the extremism of Rumania's last dictator or the fundamentalist pornography of the Satanscare industry. Whether or not you are a public Satanist, it behooves you to know the facts and to dismantle (logically and gently) the propaganda of your friends, neighbors, and associates. As the remnants of the old Aeon -- this is to say, spiritual toxic waste -- are cleared away, your magic will have progressively less resistance to overcome, and your personal safety will be enhanced. My nephew, the Daimon Egan, recommends the particularly useful Satanism in America: How the Devil Got Much More Than His Due for dismantling such hindrances. 6. Recognize the possibility of immortality in seeming setbacks. Many people along the path confuse magic with magical thinking. These people are always expecting a trouble-free life: no flat tires, winning the big one, and decidedly fewer red lights. Whereas Xeper often reveals its presence through beneficial synchronicity, we are still constrained by the natural order. One of the great mysteries of Satanism is how the inward force evolves through the medium of internal and external necessity. Necessity presents a challenge, for example we were overlooked for a job promotion. The magical thinker would go buy a spell kit. He waves his wand and sprinkles gold lodestone sand and holds his mouth just right. He attributes his failure to \"having done the ritual wrong.\" We work to change the promotion process. When we have changed the process, we not only have performed the magical act of getting the job we want, but also we have changed an aspect of the world to reflect our internal order. We have put part of ourselves in the minds of others -- a functional part of ourselves has been placed in the world because we used the level the natural order presented us. This type of immortality (living on in the thoughts of others) is actually open to everyone. I sometimes weep that the RHP has stolen this truth from so many."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"7. Detach yourself from the natural order by ending boredom. Students of Gurdjieff won't be surprised when I say that we spend most of our lives asleep. Being asleep means we are moved on by the world machine. The most deadening form of sleep is boredom. We can spend large amounts of time in the most banal activities -- reading yesterday's newspapers, slack-jawed watching of Laverne and Shirley reruns. Use the word of Indulgence to end this zombiehood. Next time you find yourself sinking into a gray numbness, remember -- \"I am here and I deserve better for I become as a god.\" Exquisite pleasures and legal perversions will bring life back to you. If you practice Indulgence to replace sleep, the red energy of life will pulse through you. Sleeping Beauty needs that kiss before she can wake up and be Queen. 8. Detach yourself from the natural order by ending guilt. The old Aeon's strongest tool was guilt. Guilt undercuts every individual thought/speech/action. Guilt is the promoter of group -think, because it tests everything against the group standards (perfect for the communistic/collectivist flavor of the last Aeon). Because we are under the programming of the old Aeon, we are prone to guilt, at best a time waster and at worst a roadblock to our Work. When you feel yourself falling into guilt, try using a magical motto to redirect your energy. I use, “If this action does not further my Xeper, my next action will overshadow this one. I pay no homage to gods outside mySelf.\" As you progress on the Left Hand Path (LHP) you will unfortunately find those who have brought guilt with them. Whereas these people may develop their magical powers apart from the natural order, they will never fully enter into Selfhood. If you have a great deal of trouble with guilt, large doses of Nietzsche, Redbeard, or La Vey may be in order. 9. Detach yourself from the natural order with time games. The calendar, the clock, and the computer have traditionally belonged to anti-individual entities. The Catholic Church, with its cycle of fasts and feasts and year of endless symbolism, stole time from the European people long ago. The Church of Satan began the reclaiming of time by declaring o f one's birthday as the supreme holiday. It's no coincidence that the flex time and work-at-home concepts have come in with the New Aeon. Begin to arrange your own life as much as possible by your schedules (and vary those lest you come up a different box of dead time). As you do things by your own time – look upon the mindless world bustling along to the ticktock of the previous age. Feel yourself -- your individuality. And in that sharp joyous moment of self awareness you will have begun to feel Set. Enough R&D for now, Uncle Setnakt hopes you have a pleasant day."}]
