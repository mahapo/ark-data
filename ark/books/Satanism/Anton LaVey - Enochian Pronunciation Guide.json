[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Enochian Pronunciation Guide An t o n Sz a n d o r L a V e y from T h e C l o v e n H o o f , May V A.S. (1970 c.e.) O f all the questions asked pertaining to the contents of Th e S a t a n i c B i b le , the most frequent is concerning the pronunciation of the Enochian Keys. I wish to stress the fact, before even dealing with the recommended pronunciation, that the importance should be placed upon the rhythmic and sequential delivery of the wo rds, rather than a scholarly attempt to pronounce them properly. The original renditions of the Keys were written in much the sam e way as He brew; i.e., the letters are only represented by consonants, with the vowel sounds unwritten. On ly one other translation of the Keys is avai lable—Israel Regardie’s inclusion in his monumental twenty-five dollar wo rk called Th e G old e n D a wn [since 1970, other editions have appeared in print, and the price of Regardie’s book is now a good deal more! ed.]. The Keys in Regardie’s wo rk are a “wh ite light” translation and occupy a scant few pages at the end of his two - volume compendium of the rituals of the Order of the Golden Dawn . They are presented in their Enochian form with only consonants to read by, so that “Zodoreje” wo uld read “Zdrj.” As you can see, this makes it decidedly tougher to pronounce! There are var ious opinions as to the proper pronunciation, just as in Lat in there are sometimes several way s of pronouncing the sam e wo rd, depending on the regional and historical speech pattern. So it is with Enochian. The wo rd “Cahisa,” if one is to prefer a soft sound pattern, wo uld be read “SA-HE E-SHA H”—the most preval ent pronunciation, however, wo uld be “KA-HE E-SAH,” or just the way it looks like it wo uld be said. Generally, all consonants should be given a hard sound: C as in cake, S as in salt, G as in gold, J as in just, etc. The delivery of the wo rds should be as deliberate and prolonged as possible, with no attempt made to jabber them quickly to show how proficient in the language you are! For those wh o saw R os e m a r y ’ s B a b y [or Th e D e v i l’ s R a i n , for wh ich LaVe y himself coached the extras] , you will recall the slow solemnity of the chants, performed in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"almost a monotone. Each syllable should be spoken with great deliberation, care being given not to skim over the sounds. A wo rd like “beliore” should result in “BAY-LE E-OA R-RAY.” “Busada” should come out “BOO-S AH-D AH.” Where two identical vowels are shown together, as in “Oo a,” the pronunciation wo uld be “OH-OH- AH.” I find most annoying the person wh o demands a wo rd-f or-wo rd translation of the Keys, not realizing they are virtually like Pigeon English in their lack of gram matical nuance and literary style. If they were to be translated literally, you may be assured that the chanter wo uld sound most inarticulate! Because the English language is a glorious display of wo rds, it is criminal not to avai l oneself of the majestic vocal renditions made possible by such a language. In the ceremonies wh ich I have conducted, I have alway s spoken the key I have chosen both in English and Enochian.
