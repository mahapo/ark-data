[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"PENTAGONAL REVISIONISM: A FIVE-POINT PROGRAM by Anton S zandor LaVey ©1988 In recent years, we’ve wasted far too much time explaining that Satanism has nothing to do with kidna pping, drug abuse, child molestation, animal or child sacrifice, or any numbe r of other acts that idiots, hyste rics or oppor tunists would like to credit us with. Satanism is a life-loving, rational philosophy that millions of people adhere to. Now we’re ready for some thing that goes quite a few steps beyond just explaining our principles. Every revisionist move ment needs a set of goals/guide lines that are clear, concrete, and that will effect signif icant changes. The following Five-Point Program reflects attitude s which allow others to decide whether they wish to align themselves with Satanism or not. Each is necessary for Satanic change to take place. When asked what we’re “doing, ” here’s the answe r: 1. Stratification— The point on which all the others ultima tely rest. There can be no more myth of “equality” for all—it only translates to “mediocrity” and suppor ts the weak at the expense of the strong. Water must be allowe d to seek its own level without interference from apologists for incompe tence. No one should be protected from the effects of his own stupidity. 2. Strict taxat ion of all churches— If churches were taxed for all their income and property, they’d crumble overnight of their own obsole scence, and the National Debt would be wiped out as quickly. The productive, the creative, the resourceful should be subsidiz ed. So long as the useless and incompe tent are getting paid, they should be heavily taxed. 3. No tolerance for religiou s beliefs secularized and incorporated into law and order issu es— to re-establish “Lex Talionis” would require a comple te overturning of the present in -justic e system based on Judeo- Christian ideals, where the victim/de fender has been made the crimina l. Amne sty should be conside red for anyone in prison because of his alleged “influence” upon the actual perpetrator of the crime. Ev e ry one is influenced in what he or she does. Scapegoating has become a way of life, a means of survival for the unfit. As an extension of the Judeo-Christian cop-out of blaming the Devil for everything, crimina ls can gain leniency, even praise, by placing the blame on a convenient villain. Following the Satanic creed of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“Responsibility to the responsible ,” in a Satanic society, everyone must experience the consequences of his own actions—f or good or ill. 4. Development and production of artificial human companions— The forbidde n industr y. An economic “godse nd” which will allow everyone “powe r” over some one else. Polite, sophistic ated, technologic ally feasible slavery. And the most profitable industr y since T.V. and the compute r. 5. The opportunity for anyone to live within a total environment of his or her choice, with mandatory adherence to the aesthetic and behavior al standards of sam e— Privately owne d, operated and controlled environme nts as an alternative to homoge nized and polyglot ones. The freedom to insula rize oneself within a social milie u of personal well-being. An oppor tunity to feel, see, and hear that which is most aesthetically pleasing, without interference from those who would pollute or detract from that option. This is the encapsula ted version of the current thrust of Satanic advocacy. So when some one asks you, “Well, what do Satanists do?”, you will be qualified to tell him."}]
