There are centurie s of work concerning and created because of personal love and personal relationships - and the problems of ordinary living and society - in literature, music, drama and so on. What has needed to be said, written and expressed about such things, has been said, written and expressed by the many great artists of the past two millennia. What is needed now is to build upon these foundations - to turn outward, and away from the inner world of the personal psyche and the world of mundane society. What is needed is to describe and express what is relevant to the next stage of our evolution, as human beings. This next stage is the stage of n ew adventures, of new worlds, of new ways of living brought through striving for a numinous and thus supra- personal goal. T"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 The personal life should now take care of itself - if there is a numinous goal to strive for. In brief, the great Art of the past has enabled us to achieve an understanding of ourselves - it has brought us to individuation, to the wisdom of a genuine Adeptship founded upon the reconciliation of opposites. We have discovered and learnt to know ourselves - and have discovered the unity, the wholeness, which lies beyond the Shadow and the Self. We ha ve learnt that we are - or can be - both Destroyer and Creator, both Lucifer and God, as we have learnt the natural necessity of both these fo rces of creation, and destruction, and how renewal and re-birth proceeds from them. We now need to and should go beyond this - for anything else is unhealthy and a waste of life. It is also the negation of the work of those great artists which has allowed us this understanding. Thus, there is no longer any need for those who desire to be great artists to endure or desire personal suffering to aid their development and their understanding, as there is no longer any need for individuals to describe their inner suffering, their persona l development and their personal understanding through artistic means. What should and must be understood in the personal sense now can be rationally understood through an act of will - through a conscious understanding of the works of Art of the past two millennia. There needs to be a whole new artistic movement - or many such movements - which seek to go beyond this personal understanding and which seeks to develop new forms of Art to express and describe what must be expressed and described in the numinous realm which lies beyond this personal understanding. We need to free ourselves from the mundane world of the past, and achieve a real understanding of and a real balance with Nature Herself. We need to strive to free ourselves of this planet of ours, at first in artistic visions and dreams, and then in practical reality as we reach out toward other planets around other stars. We need to dream great visions again, as we need to strive to make these visions real. Thus, do we need to become inspired by greatness - we need to dream of and create new civilizations, new aeons, new Empires to stretch ourselves in, to explore and discover, and to use to create an entire new species of higher beings who are fulfilling the promise of existence latent within them.

It seems quite natural to me that a religion which espouses freedom of thought and the exalta tion of the ego would encourage inidividual expression of belief as opposed to a dogmatic definition imposed by an organization. Unlike Christianity which imposes a belief system upon its followers, Satanism encourages individual growth and development. Satanism is individualism. With this in mind, no two Satanists will share the same exact definition of what Satanism is. It is, in fact, this which they hold in common. The religion of Satanism is one. There is no such thing as Modern Satanism, Traditional Satanism, or whatever! Satanism is the religion of the self, the ego, the god within. It is ultimately whatever you choose to make it.

Since then, it has influenced the lives of many individuals. Those who have expe rimented with the rituals have, undoubtedly, experienced the apparent subjective reality implied by the author of the text. Since the books appearance on the Embassy of Lucifer website (May, 2001), it has been reproduced several times on other Satanism websites. As is often the case on the Internet, few of these sites have given credit to the author of the work. Some have claimed that the Demonic Bible is a “work of fiction”. As anyone who has experiment with the rituals can attest to, however, this “work of fiction” has a profound psychological impact upon the practitioner. The reader ignores at his own peril the author’s warnings that improper use of the rituals can lead to a psychological breakdown with reality. This is not a “work of fiction” but ra ther the foundation of what is now known as deitic magic. The roots of deitic magic lie in thelemic (as practiced by the O.T.O./A.A.) and setian magic (from the Church of Satan/Temple of Set tradition), but it is also heavily influenced by the septenary system of the O.N.A.

The followers of every religion have been condemned by others as \"devil-worshippers\" at some time or another.

"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 Introduction to the 3 rd Edition EITUS, My name is Tsirk Susej and I am the Senior Ambassador of the Embassy of Lucifer. The Embassy of Lucifer is an organization dedicated to the creation of an independent and sovereign state modelled after the city-states of the pre-Christian pagan world and with a system of government and law ba sed upon satanic ethics rather than the outdated moral code of Christian ity. To this end, the Embassy of Lucifer acts regionally and nationally through diplomatic agents in various parts of the world. The Embassy of Lucifer is emphatically NOT a church. And, while it is a political organization espousing what may be considered a \"Satanism- friendly\" agenda, the Embassy of Luci fer is not necessarily a \"Satanic\" organization. The Embassy of Lucifer is concerned with causing change in the \"real-world\" as opposed to involvement in the so-called \"Online Satanic Community.\" Unlike certain other organizations, the Embassy of Lucifer is not designed to make a profit or to stroke the ego of some hierophant. The Embassy of Lucifer exists as an organization for D"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 leaders in the Satanic Community to work together and achieve common goals. The Embassy of Lucifer began in 1991 during a period when the LaVey Church of Satan was no longer active . I had become an ordained priest of the Church of Satan (Penn.) and Ambassador of the Embassy of S.A.T.A.N., and was also involved in several other satanic organizations. I published a newsletter called the Bl ack Jackal and in this newsletter published for the first time my own system of magic which is contained in the Demonic Bible. Many years later, my experiments with aeonics culminated in the discovery of a new Magickal Word, the Word DEITUS. \"The Word of the Aeon is DEITUS for man has become God, Lucifer has risen, the Gates have been opened, the Heavens have been conquered, and the Ancient Ones rule once more.\" These are the Words which establish the Aeon of Lucifer. The Word of the Aeon is DEITUS. The Law of the Aeon is THELEM A, XEPER, DEITUS or \"Will to come into being as a God.\" This Law refers to the evolution of man into a being equal to a god through the a pplication of the Magickal Will to the expansion of the psyche or the conscious exaltation to achieve divinity. The Word DEITUS rests upon the Words CHAOS and UNITY, diametrically opposed forces which coexist in the Aeonic Sphere, and builds upon the Words THELEMA and XEPER which established the previous Aeons of Horus and Set. The Embassy of Lucifer is, therefore, the vehicle for the advancement of DEITUS as the Word of the Aeon of Lucifer. Central to Deitic Philosophy is the belief that every individual has the potential to achieve divinity through the exultation of his will to the expansion of consciousness and that \"every man and every woman is a star.\" To become a god, one must accept hi s place as a god upon the earth and assume the responsibility which comes with being a god. With power comes responsibility and with responsibility comes purpose. It is in the realization of one's responsibility to the spiritual and psychological evolution of humanity, that indivi dual purpose and direction may be understood and appreciated. When I state that we must act as gods , I do not imply that we must be “all good” or “all loving” but rather that, like the gods of the ancient world, we must be unique, powerful, individual beings, manifesting force"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 of “Will” and personality. Soon the wo rld will be filled with beings the likes of Zeus, Aphrodite, Neptune, and Apollo. The role of the Embassy of Lucifer is to bring together these unique beings with the power to define their own reality. In this, there is no dogma or doctrine, no prescribed formula, and no laws. Each member of the Embassy is a god capable of bending reality to his will. Deitic Philosophy does not represent dogma as there is no one established path which an individual must follow in order to attain DEITUS or one prescribed belief-system which members of the Embassy of Lucifer must blindly fo llow. As gods, we define our own reality and live with the consequences of our actions and of the forces which we set in motion by our movements. As the planets move around the sun without questioning the reason for the courses which they follow, we who have attained godhood possess the Knowledge and Conversation of Our Holy Guardian Angels/ Demons (or higher Magical Selves) and thus act by our True Will. The activities of the Embassy of Lucifer are both political and magical but we are not the first organization to combine magic and politics. The same was true of the Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Golden Dawn, and O.T.O. It is commonly known that th e United States was established by Freemasons on the principles of Ma sonry which had been condemned by the Pope as \"Satanic.\" Occult & Magical Orders have influenced politics throughout history. The Embassy of Lucifer shares more commonality with traditional magical organizations than does the COS or TOS. Deitic Philosophy does, however, incorporate the philosophy of LaVey and Aquino. The Word DEITUS shares much in common with the Setian Word XEM which means \"I Am\" or \"I have become.\" Unlike many organizations, membership in the Embassy of Lucifer is by appointment only. It is not an or ganization you can join simply by sending money and filling out a questionnaire. Only those who are chosen by the Dark Lord are ap pointed to positions within the Embassy. The Embassy of Lucifer does, however, recognize ordination by certain organizations such as the Church of Satan or Temple of Set. The reason for this is that we have no reason, at this time, to question the screening processes of either of these organizations. Both organizations, despite obvious theological and dogmatic differences, have well established screening polic ies for new members. Members of the 3rd degree, in good standing with the Temple of Set, may bypass"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 many of Embassy's screening procedures. The same is true of ordained clergy of the Church of Satan and hi gher ranking members of the FCoS, and FSC. My approach to membership has changed a great deal in the last four years. Membership will no longer be granted except to those individuals who demonstrate great experience and talent and who, by their actions, reveal themselves to already be “A mbassadors” of the Dark Lord. Many of those who joined the Embassy three years ago did not possess the requisite knowledge to act as agents of the Dark Lord. The Embassy of Lucifer is an organization for leaders rather than for followers. It is essentially a “franchise”, or a na me, which leaders in the Satanic Community can use in the creation of a satanic church, temple, or order. The Embassy of Lucifer recognizes that Satanists are the elite and that few such individuals exist in each part of the world. The design of the Embassy is, therefore, conducive to individual Satanists acting as diplomatic agents and Satanic groups acting as regional consulates of one large international organization. Regional Consulates retain their autonomy while being part of a much larger organization. DEITUS is about personal godhood, a \"coming into being\" as a god. This is expressed by the Law of the Aeon of Lucifer THELEMA, XEPER, DEITUS which means \"Will to Come into Being as a God.\" DEITUS forums on the Internet are a place to explore personal godhood. In such groups there is no one truth, but rather many truths... and many falsehoods. Each individual is *potentially* his own god with the ability to define his own reality. Th is strength of Will to define one's own reality is what separates Thelemit es, Satanists, Setians, and followers of the Left-Hand-Path from all othe r religions and mystical systems. DEITUS groups are, therefore, forums for the discussion of all ideas which the outside world calls \"Satanic\", \"dark\", \"occult\", or \"forbidden\". They may also be a place for the discussion of things \"spiritual\" or \"metaphysical\" for therein will be found both, light and darkness, truth and error, wisdom and deceit. DEITUS is the Word of the Aeon of Lucifer. The Law of the Aeon is THELEMA, XEPER, DEITUS or \"Will to come into being as a God.\" This Magickal Law signifies the uniting of the rational and supra-rational being in the creation/evolution of a new psyche, a being equal in every respect to a god. Deitic philosophy, as put forth within the Embassy of Lucifer, combines Thelemic philosophy of the OTO/AA and Setian"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 philosophy of the TOS with an emphasis on the final objective of XEPER which is the end product of the dialectical equation of Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis. When I was sixteen and first read the Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey, I understood rationally the statement that man is god. Man creates god in his image and therefore man is god, the creator of all gods. It was several years later that I began to understand emotionally that man is god. I began to face the reality of existenti al existence in a universe where there is no other god. Many more years pa ssed before I began to realize the metaphysical implications of the statement that man is god. The magician has the power to exert his Will over the universe and to create thought-forms obedient to his command. Thus, to all practical purposes, the magician acts as a god. Many more years passed still before I realized the spiritual significance of these word s. Man is God, spiritually as well as physically. There is a source consciousness from which individual consciousness arises. This being is dynamic and evolving and is manifest most strongly within those who exercise strength of Will. Man is the very embodiment of God exercising dominion over the universe. Setian philosophy holds that XEPER is never-ending and that one must XEPER and REMANIFEST continually in the path to XEM. That which is beyond one's understanding is called RUNA but it is continually changing just as the hor izon of one's journey is never the same. With the realization that th e ultimate goal of the dynamic consciousness is the evolution of man as a being equal to a god, XEM becomes DEITUS. One may continue to XEPER and REMANIFEST but with the realization of XEM-DEITUS as his goal. Approaching XEPER is personal and it is said in The Book of Coming Forth By Night \"the text of another is an affront to self.\" The Demonic Bible is therefore not a book of rituals to be parroted. It is a personal text representing my path to DEITUS. I shared this book so that others may benefit from it. The approach to the \"Dark Gods\" given in the Demonic Bible is similar to that expressed in the literature of the ONA. The practitioner calls the \"demons\" and \"Dark Gods\" into his body and his psyche, opening \"Gates\" to the acausal in which these archetypal beings have their subjective existence. Through the rituals of the Demonic Bible, the practitioner may become a \"Nexeon\" to the acausal and \"presence\" the Dark Forces in the physical world."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 This approach is much more \"sinister\" and \"dark\" than the approach of most modern Satanic groups which portray Satan as a harmless archetype for rebellion and carnality or a positive force for change in the universe. Satan is in fact an archetype of carnality (as they say) and is a force which brings about change but few who call themselves Satanists wish to equate carnality with perversity or change with violence and bloodshed. In truth, however, change only arises through the slaughter of the innocent and ascendance of evil and carnality may include the most extreme forms of perversity and sexual indulgence. This approach may be more \"sinister\" since it involves becoming one with the \"Forces of Darkness\" or a ctualizing those aspects of the psyche which have been called the \"Forces of Darkness.\" The ultimate goal is the evolution of a higher being, both personally and super-personally, for it is both psychological and physical/genetic change which is sought. This evolution of man represents th e next stage in that experiment which began aeons ago when ape-like creatures received the \"gift of Set\" and became man. There are other Magickal Words which support DEITUS. Two words I became aware of five years ag o were UNITY and CHAOS. These two words stand in opposition forming a dialectic balance. This balance is reflective of the duality of man. John Allee (then Lord Egan) of the First Church of Satan was working to promote the Word UNITY. At the same time as this, Chaos-Magici ans were claiming that the Word of the Aeon was CHAOS. I had, myself, previously thought CHAOS to be the Word of the Aeon in 1999 when I began to work upon the Aeonic Sphere. The Word of the Aeon was not Chaos, however, and I came to the realization that the Word was DEITUS. Later, in dialogue with Lord Egan, I realized that DEITUS is established upon a balance between CHAOS and UNITY, dialectically opposed principles which coexist in what may be called the Aeonic Sphere. It is in the balance between Chaos & Unity, light & dark, good & evil, that an individual may achieve a perfect understanding of self and “Will to Come Into Being as a god.” At the age of 18, while attending university, a number of strange events occurred to me which culminated in the subjective feeling that I was “in contact” with an intelligence separate from myself. These events were"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 witnessed by others as well as myself. The “spirit” revealed itself to me as Azael and, after several weeks, began to reveal the rituals which make up the Demonic Bible. As I stat e in the commentary of the Demonic Bible, I performed the rituals and had incredibly vivid and symbolic dreams which I believe corresponded with the “crossing of the Gates.” From that point on, I performed the rituals hundreds of times, adding new rituals and changing the formula as seemed appropriate. Over the past sixteen years, the Demonic Bible has evolved into the text presented in this book. I see the Demonic Bible as a “living book.” Since publishing it on the Internet five years ago, it has evolve d even more than it did during the previous eleven years I worked and re-w orked the rituals. It is no longer my own private system of magic but a magickal system which will continue to evolve and expand to incorporate new concepts. Those who work with the rituals change the nature of the rituals by the very act of working with them. It is a \"living\" system as opposed to a \"dead\" system of magic or one which has not been pr acticed for centuries. This is what makes the Demonic Bible much more powerful than most grimoires. When you consider the mapping of the human genome, cloning, and the role of technology in our lives, there ca n be no doubt that this is the age of the light-bearer. I am not egocen tric enough to believe, however, that I am solely responsible for its inception. I spoke a Word and declared a Law, but what this means esentially is that I was aware of a change which took place. Others have perhaps sensed that change and expressed it in other terms. Five years ago, the world became something altogether different from what it was. This is not the world which existed a half decade ago. This is something beyond anything prevously imagined. In this age man has the potential to realize himself as a god upon the earth. From a certain perspective, the Demonic Bible is simply a book of rituals which I wrote for my own use and it is up to each magician to create his own “Demonic Bible”. From another perspective the Demonic Bible may be the grimoire of all grimoires, the most evil book imaginable. The formula given in the Demonic Bible may be the “key” which unlocks the very Gates of Hell. The Demonic Bible may be just one formula for attaining DEITUS or possibly the “only” formula which can lead to DEITUS.

"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 Introduction to the 2 nd Edition ucifer, the Light-Bearer The name Lucifer comes from the Latin words “lux” (light) and “fer” (to bear). Lucifer means, literally, “light-bearer” and was the name given by the Romans to the morning st ar Venus when it appeared in the eastern sky in the hours before dawn . Lucifer, the light-bearer, the morning star, personified enlightenme nt, wisdom, and beauty. The cult of Lucifer was associated with the worship of Venus or Aphrodite, the goddess of love and passion, and involv ed sexual acts of which the early Christians did not approve. The acceptance of Christianity as the official religion of Rome, and subsequent conversion of pagans to the New Faith, resulted in the name Lucifer becoming associated with the devil Satan. If Jesus is the light and truth, reasoned the Christian, then Lucifer must be a false light, a deceiver, even a fallen angel. Christianity condemned paganism, goddess-worship, and sexuality as evil ; and the cult of Lucifer could be associated with all of these. Lucife r became the Latin name for the devil of Hebrew origin, Satan. L"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 In Hebrew mythology, Satan was an angel who accused men before God in order to bring about their punish ment. He was never the enemy of God but at times the enemy of man. The name Satan in Hebrew means “adversary.” It is recounted in the Bible that the Jews were carried away as captives into Babylon. When later freed by the Persians, the Jews were exposed to the religion of Zoroaster. The Jews adopted Zoroastrian belief of a war in heaven between Ahura-Mazda and Ahriman, the serpent, with Yahweh taking the role of Ahura-Mazda and Satan assuming the part of the serpent Ahriman. Satan, a minor angel in Hebrew mythology, became e qual in power with God. The belief of a war in heaven betw een God and Satan was carried into Europe by the early Christians. In Christian mythology, Lucifer became the highest of the angels, created in the perfect image of God, who fell from grace because of his pride. Du ring the spread of Christianity in Europe the Devil began to take on th e form most often associated with him today. Christians gave him the a ttributes of many of the old pagan gods: horns, tail, and cloven hooves. He became the god of fertility, the god of lust, the god of the dead, and the god of magic. Devil Worshippers and Luciferans To facilitate conversion, pagan holy days became Christian holy days. Pagan temples were destroyed and became the sites of Christian churches. The less “demonic” looking gods were converted into angels in God’s armies as pagans were converted en masse to the new religion. The mass conversion of pagans to Christianity was not entirely successful, however. In many countries, the people worshipped Christ alongside the “Old Gods.” By the twelfth century there were a number of Gnostic Heresies which threatened the power of the Church in Rome. One Gnostic Sect was known as the Lu ciferans. The Luciferans believed that Lucifer was the true God and Yahweh was the Devil. Another Gnostic sect, better known, was th e Knights Templar. The Knights Templar fought in the Crusades against the Muslims but upon seeing how much more advanced the Mus lims were to themselves, converted to the religion of those they had fought. During the 12 th and 13 th centuries, the various Gnostic heresies were suppressed and many of their followers executed. The trial of the Knights Templar and the suppression of the various Gnostic heresies were only a foreshadowing,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 however, of the witch-hunts and in quisitions which spanned the 14 th to 17 th centuries as the Church condemned anyone suspected of paganism or witchcraft to death by burning. As the people labored under the oppression of the Church, some began to see Satan as a preferable master to Jesus of Nazareth. The church condemned every natural inclination as sinful and wicked. The only way to salvation, the people were told, was denial of the flesh and obedience to the Church and State. It is questionable whether or not there was a single Satanist before the Inquisition, but as a result of Christian oppression (and repression) the cult of Satanism and practice of witchcraft and magic developed. Those Evil Masons & Broth ers of the Rosy Cross Masonic lodges, which began to appear in France and England in the 18 th century and spread to other countries, made a number of false claims: a) the origin of masonry can be traced to ancient Jerusalem and the construction of Solomon’s Temple , b) freemasonry is linked with the Knights Templar, and c) the leader of the lodge is in contact with Master Beings who live in the Himalayas “The Illuminati.” The early lodges had no connection to each other but ma de similar claims of possessing “hidden knowledge” passed down from ancient times or from a race of “secret masters” in the east. In re ality, these lodges had very few “secrets” to reveal other than hand -shakes and grade signs but Masonry was condemned by the Church as a form of devil-worship which only added to its popularity. Freemasons may have had few hidden secrets, but the myth of Masonic secrecy led to more myserious (and occasionally more sinister) occult lodges being established. One such group was the Rosicrucians, the Brethren of the Rosy Cross. Among them was the magician Francis Barrett, author of the Magus , a classic on the subject of ceremonial magic, and Eliphas Levi, author of numerous books on the Cabala. This was followed a century later by another o ccult order, known as the Golden Dawn, of which the magician Aleister Crowley was a member. The Golden Dawn, like the earlier Rosicrucian Brotherhood, explored the study of the Jewish Cabala, Egyptian Magic, and the Enochian Keys of Dr. John Dee. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 The Cabala is a system of Hebrew mysticism which identifies ten Sephiroth, or emanations of God in graduated order from pure spirit to the course material world. Even the “shells” or “husks” (evil spirits) are manifestations of God’s power. In Jewish belief, God is infinite and therefore beyond description. Yahweh , according to the Cabalist, is not the name of God but the phonetic pronunciation of the word God spoke at the moment of Creation. YHVH, called the Divine Tetragrammaton or sacred four letter word, represents the elements earth, air, fire, and water. Th e Hebrew God was a god of physical manifestation who appeared to Mose s in a burning bush and to the Israelites as a pillar of flame by night and cloud of vapor by day. It is likely that the Hebrew mystical beliefs (which later formed the Cabala) developed during the time the Israelites lived among the Egyptians. Prior to the development of the Cabala, the Jewish religion was a fertility cult of the god Adonai, or El. The Israelites were Syrian foreigners to Egypt, Osiris being the Egyptian name for the Syrian fertility god of the Jews. A similar mystical system (to the Cabala) developed in Egypt centered on the god Amen. Followers of the Egyptian god Amen began to teach that there was one god, Amen, and that all other gods were manifestations of this one true god. The development of monotheism and my sticism occurred simultaneously among the Egyptians and Israelites. Taken alone, the Cabala is purely a myst ical system but it lent itself well to magical application. “Words” held the power to change reality and “Names” compelled obedience from elemental beings. Grimoires, or books of ceremonial magic based on Cabalistic belief, cataloged the names and sigils of countless demons over which it was said the magician could exercise power. Many of these books were attributed to biblical figures such as Solomon, Moses, or Enoch. The Enochian System of magic adopt ed by the Golden Dawn was based on the Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee . Dee, an Elizabethan astrologer and magician, working with another man, Edward Kelly, produced a series of 18 keys in what they claimed was the original angelic language and apparently revealed to Enoch, the first man after the “fall” to walk with God. The English translation of the keys bear a striking similarity to invocations in the Clavicula Solomonis , another medieval grimoire, but Dee & Kelly claimed that the keys were revealed to them by the angels, the letters of the words shown to them in a crystal show stone. The"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee also gives the invocation for various spirits with which Dee & Kelly communicated. A Beast of Revelation On April 4, 1904, Aleister Crowley, declared the start of a new aeon... the Aeon of Horus. In Crowley’s philosophy each aeon represents a stage in the non-natural evolution of man. The Aeon of Isis was a time when man lived in close harmony with the natural world and the dominant religions involved the worship of nature. This was characterized by the pre-Christian pa gan world. The Aeon of Osiris, which followed the Aeon of Isis, was a time when man rejected the natural world, accepting self-denial an d sacrifice of the flesh and body as the ideal. Christianity rose as the dominant religion in the west during the Aeon of Osiris. Crowley, who came to believe that he was the “Beast” described in the Book of the Revelation of Jesus to St. John the Apostle, wrote the Book of the Law , which he claimed was revealed to him by the spirit Aiwass and was a true revelation from the Egyptian deities Nuit, Hadit, and Ra Hoor Khut. In the Book of the Law we read DoWhat Thou Will Shall Be the Whole of the Law and Love Is the Law, Love under Will . The Word of the Aeon of Horus was THELEMA, the Gr eek Word for Will. The WILL in this context was a magical WILL, the true will of the magician’s higher self or his Holy Guardian Angel. Crowley’s magic k, as embraced by the Order of Oriental Templars (OTO) and Order of the Silver Star (AA) combined eastern mysticism and yoga with the western ceremonial magic of the Golden Dawn. In practice, however, Crowley’s magic k largely involved sex and drug use. It was the sexual aspects of tantric yoga Crowley adopted together with some of the more deviant practices of Black Magicians and Satanists of Middle Ages Europe. The Age of Satan Begins On April 30, 1966, former lion-tamer and carnival calliope player Anton LaVey, ritually shaved his head and declared the formation of the Church of Satan and the start of th e Age of Satan. The catchphrase of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 the Church of Satan was “indulgence instead of abstinence... but not compulsion.” Anton LaVey taught his followers to indulge in every sin because they all lead to physical and emotional happiness. Compulsions, he said, are never created by indulgin g but by being unable to indulge. The Church of Satan entertained a parade of celebrities and journalists. Reporters from throughout the world came to write about the Black Pope and his Satanic Church. For the first time in history, there was a church dedicated to Satan... not an underground cult or secret society, not a temple of satanic worship veiled in Christian trappings, but an actual church dedicated to the Devil. The Church of Satan took a position of professed atheism. Satan, claimed His priests, was not a literal being with tail, horns, and pitchfork, but a metaphoric representation, a Jungian archetype, a product of the subconscious mind. Like the 18 th century Hellfire Club of Sir Francis DashWood, the Churc h of Satan made “Satanism” fun while maintaining that there was nothing “occult” or “sinister” in its philosophy or practice. Satan, to the Church of Satan was a Miltonian figure, a symbol of defiance against tyranny. It is Satan who says, “I would rather rule in Hell than serve in Heaven.” This combined with the philosophy of Nietzche, who says plainly, “God is dead,” made the philosophy of the Church of Satan attractive to the rebel and the outcast. The Second Beast In 1975, Michael Aquino, a Magister Templi in the Church of Satan, along with several other members, resigned from the Church of Satan and established the Temple of Set. One of the key issues in the schism was the alleged sale of titles within the Church of Satan. Members of the Church of Satan who felt they had earned recognition for their knowledge of the Black Arts and their commitment to the organization were greatly distressed to see titles being awarded to people who did nothing more than give funds to the church. The argument for the awarding of the titles was that materi al success is an indication of satanic might and therefore the individuals in question deserved the titles regardless of their knowledge or previous commitment. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 Michael Aquino, claiming to be in contact with Satan (in the ancient Egyptian form of Set), wrote the Book of the Coming Forth by Night in which he declared the start of the Aeon of Set, a succession to the Aeon of Horus. The Word of the Aeon was XEPER, an Egyptian Word which means “to become” or “to come into being”. The Egyptian God Xepera was associated with the scarab beetle and was the god of “expansion of consciousness.” Michael Aquino claimed to be the “Second Beast” from the Book of the Revelation of Jesus to St. John the Apostle and the “Spiritual Son” of Al eister Crowley described in the Book of the Law . In contrast to the Church of Satan’s professed atheism, the Temple of Set embraced the literal existence of S et, not as a Christian devil, but as an ancient Egyptian god associated with the “night sky” and with the “expanding of consciousness.” According to Aquino, Horus and Set were the gods of ancient Egypt prior to the Syrian invasion. Later, Set was personified as evil, the enemy of Osiris. One of Set’s titles, Set-Hen was adopted by the Jews and became Satan. By using a more ancient name for Satan, the Temple of Set wa s able to escape the accusation that Satanism is merely an anti-Christian religion. The Nine Angles Both before and after the schism wi thin the Church of Satan, there were a number of groups which split off from the Church of Satan. By the 1980’s, there were dozens of satanic churches but the original Church of Satan had become nonfunctional. The reason for this was that, after the COS/TOS split in 1975, Anton LaVey abandoned the grotto system and redesigned the Church of Satan as a business for his personal gain. The Church of Satan continued to sell membership but there was no longer any pretense of an organization behi nd the name. Only after LaVey’s death was the Church of Satan rees tablished and the grotto system reinstituted. Many of the groups which broke off from the Church of Satan or were established during the decade the Church of Satan was non-functional adopted the philosophy presented by Anton LaVey in the Satanic Bible . A few of these groups claimed to be the “true” Church of Satan. One group, however, which did not claim any connection and disavowed any association with the Church of Satan, was the Order of Nine Angles in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 the U.K. The Order of Nine Angl es claimed to be an order of “traditional” Satanists who did not subscribe to the “watered-down” philosophy presented in the Satanic Bible . The ONA shocked many Satanists by supporting “human sacr ifice” or “culling” and encouraging National Socialism as a means to the creation of a new aeon. In the literature of the ONA, Sata n was represented not as a Jungian archetype or as a literal being but rather as an entity which exists in the acausal, outside of the causal three-dimensional reality in which we exist. Initiates of the ONA were encouraged to “presence” the Dark Forces by being “sinister” and therein become “nexus’s” or “gateways” to the “Forces of Darkness”. By “presencing the Forces of Darknes,” and engaging in acts which would chan ge the world towards the sinister, initiates of the ONA sought to further the “sinister dialectic of history”. The Devil’s Ambassadors The First Embassy to the Dark Lord was the creation of Yaj Nomolos, Prophet of the Second Coming. Nomolos, an ordained priest of the Church of Satan, established the Embassy located in Whitehall, PA, known as the Embassy of S.A.T.A.N. (S.A.T.A.N. stands for Survival and the Androgyne Nation.) The Social Realist philosophy espoused by Nomolos was one of predator and prey emphasizing survival of the fittest. Satan, remarked Nomolos, was an androgynous being. In the future, he believed, mankind would evolve into an androgynous race. A New Embassy... A New Aeon The Embassy of Lucifer was established in 1991 CE, by Magus Tsirk Susej, as a political embassy representing the Dark Lord and His Infernal Empire and as the vehicle for the creation of a new aeon. Magus Susej understood at the time only that this new aeon, the Aeon of Lucifer, would begin sometime after the year 1999. In the year 2000, Magus Susej’s magical experiments with aeonics culminated in the discovery of the Word DEITUS as the magical dictum for the Aeon of Lucifer. The year 2001 CE became known as year 1 in the Aeon of Lucifer. Magus Susej had previously been a ppointed as an ambassador of the Embassy of S.A.T.A.N. and been ordain ed as a priest of the Church of"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 Satan. He had also been a member of the Temple of Set, the Order of the Left-Hand-Path, and the Order of Nine Angles. He had studied at length the literature of these and ot her satanic organizations. In the Embassy of Lucifer he brought together the philosophy of all these groups and combined this unified sa tanic philosophy with the system of ritual revealed to him by his “Unholy Guardian Demon”, the spirit Azael. The declaration of DEITUS as the Word of the Aeon of Lucifer can be seen as an indication that the Em bassy of Lucifer is the natural successor to the TOS, COS, and OT O/AA, since the Aeon of Lucifer succeeded the Aeon of Set and the previous Aeon of Horus. Unlike most satanic rituals, which “invoke” de mons as beings or forces alien to the magician, the rituals presented in the Demonic Bible allow the magician to “open the Gates of Hell” and “become one with the Forces of Darkness.” It can now be seen that the Embassy of Lucifer fulfills the ONA’s objectives in “presencing the Forces of Darkness” and “becoming nexus’s or gateways to the acausal” as well as establishing a new aeon and creating a new race homo deitus , (called homo galacticus in ONA literature.) The Embassy of S. A.T.A.N. may no longer exist, but the Social Realist philosophy of Nomolos and the Embassy of S.A.T.A.N.’s goal of creating an independent nation (the Island of Pan- Shaitan) influenced the philosophy and objectives of the Embassy of Lucifer. The Embassy of Lucifer may be seen as the successor to the Church of Satan, Temple of Set, Order of Oriental Templars, Order of Nine Angles, and Embassy of S.A.T.A.N., but Magus Susej has made no claim of exclusivity for members of hi s organization. Members of the Embassy of Lucifer have an obligat ion to further the development and advancement of the Satanic Community by working with other satanic organizations for common goals and objectives. The Law of the Aeon of Lucifer THELEMA, XEPER, DETIUS or “Will to come into being as a God,” gives those who recognize their own divinity the mandate to raise others with the potential to eventually become gods. The Embassy of Lucifer has no program, however, for in itiating members since it is not an organization for followers but rather for leaders. Other organizations already exist which serve the function of initiating neophytes and training adepts. Those who become adepts will find their way to the Embassy of Lucifer. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 Magus Tsirk Susej, Antichrist agus Susej was born in 1970 in British Columbia, Canada. At the age of seven, after his family spent two years living in a “haunted house”, he became interested in the supernatural. His romance with the occult grew and by the age of thirteen he had studied a great many works on the occult and supernatural including many books by researchers of the para normal. He grew disinterested in parapsychology, however, as he found that parapsychologists were more concerned with paranormal events in themselves than with the spiritual reality which paranormal events suggested. He realized that parapsychologists would never find the scientific and rational explanation they sought since they had blinded themselves to the mystic and spiritual reality which was the cause of the very events these researchers witnessed. M"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 At the age of fourteen, he turned hi s attention to mythology and folklore and has said that he “fell in love” with the goddess Diana of Greek mythology. His fascination with my thology quickly combined with his belief in the supernatural and drew him into the study of witchcraft and magic. Where parapsychology sought a rational explanation for occult phenomena, magic offered an answer. As sixteen, he read the Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey. Like many others who have been influenced by Satanism, he did not “become” a Satanist but, rather, realized that he had always been a Satanist. While most authors of books on witchcraft were more occupied with showing how “good” and “pure” and “spiritual” they were and how “un-satanic” the spells they practiced were, Anton LaVey presented magic for what it was. In 1989, while attending the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada, Tsirk began practicing Satani sm. He had already spent close to eight years studying the occult bu t had only previously performed a few rituals. It was during this time that he began writing the Demonic Bible. He claims that a number of strange events occurred (which were witnessed by friends and companions as well as himself.) These events culminated in his being contacted by the spirit Azael which began revealing to him the rituals contained in the Demonic Bible. He performed the rituals and experienced the crossing of the gates in “extremely vivid and symbolic dreams.” In 1989, at the age of 19, he began working for the Atmospheric Environment Service of Environment Canada. Over the next few years his library grew extensively as he st udied Cabalistic magic, Enochian magic, Sumerian/Babylonian magic, Celtic magic, Norse magic, Egyptian magic, Witchcraft, Voodoo, and Satanism. He sought out the LaVey Church of Satan but, at the time, the Church of Satan was no longer active. He instead became involved in several other satanic organizations: the Embassy of S.A.T.A. N., the Temple of Set, the Order of the Left-Hand-Path, the Temple of Pan-Shaitan, and the Order of the Nine Angles. He studied the literature of these Satanic groups while continuing to work with the Demonic Bible and experiment with new rituals. In 1991, he established the Embassy of Lucifer as a “political embassy dedicated to the Dark Lord” and as “a vehicle for the creation of a new aeon”. He did not fully understand at the time what form this “new aeon” would take. He knew only that it would begin sometime after the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 year 1999. The Embassy of Lucifer received some publicity when he attempted to get its name added to the “Churches” sign on the highway outside of his town. Articles appeared in the local paper, the Province , and MacLean’s Magazine . He was also interviewed on CBC radio. Representing the fact that the Embassy of Lucifer was still “underground” and that it would be several years before the “Rise of Lucifer”, the Embassy of Lucifer was also known then as the Order of Anubis. He published the newsletter: the Black Jackal, and presented for the first time the Demonic Bible. The rituals of the Demonic Bible (as it existed at that time) were published in the Black Jackal over a period of five months. In 1996, Magus Susej began work as a Port Inspector & Marine Surveyor for SGS, an international inspection service and in 1997, his daughter was born. By this time, he had settled into the domestic life and had retired from active involvement in Satanism. His role in openly establishing an Embassy to the Dark Lord had, however, gained him a few enemies. Those who sought his downfall waited patiently until opportunity presented itself and then struck. He was falsely accused and, in the later part of 1997, convic ted of sexual assault. While the accusation was not serious in itself, his refusal to accept a plea bargain resulted in a sentence of six months in jail and eighteen months probation. This was not the last time he would spend in jail. Enraged at his conviction, he made the choice to become a criminal. After his release, he committed a se ries of frauds on the Internet. When he was finally arrested a year later and charged with “obtaining money by false pretences” he fled British Columbia and carried out more fraudulent activities in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia while on the run from the police. When he was finally apprehended entering the US at the Maine border (October 30, 1999), he was wanted in three Canadian provinces. He was deported from the US to stand trial. He received another six months in jail and three years of probation. During his run from the police, he claimed to have a metaphysical experience which can only be described as “having passed through an abyss.” He claims to have literally and metaphorically (or metaphysically) died, traveled through a world of the dead, and returned to the land of the living. In that “other place” he experienced, “there was no god, no devil... just an eternal twilight where life lingers”; an"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 ethereal plane if you will just beyond the material realm. Whether this experience was a literal reality or purely subjective, one thing was certain. He was no longer the person he had been. He crossed the abyss and come face to face with his true self... He had become a Magus. Once again he began work on the De monic Bible. He performed the rituals of the Demonic Bible again, the rituals that he had performed many times over the years. This time, however, he spoke the Word which would destroy the universe and all within it and create a new universe... he spoke the Word DEITUS. He understood that by THELEMA and by XEPER, he had “willed to come into being as a god”... he “had attained DEITUS.” In May, 2000 the Aeon of Lucifer began. The articles which make up the first section of the Demonic Bible were written at this time, imme diately following his declaration of the Word DEITUS. Copies of these documents were sent to the Temple of Set for their consideration. He had spoken the Word and, in doing so, become Magus of the Aeon of Lucifer. With this came both the Task of the Magus and the Curse of the Magus . The Task of the Magus is the responsibility of making the Law of the Aeon and the Word of the Aeon known to others. The correlative to this is the Curse of the Magus . The Curse of the Magus is to be perceived by others as misguided. His first act as Magus of the Aeon of Lu cifer was to inform the Temple of Set that a new aeon had begun and that the Aeon of Set (which immediately preceded the Aeon of Lu cifer) was now at an end. He never received a reply. The following year, Magus Susej, r eestablished the Embassy of Lucifer as the “vehicle for the Aeon of Lucifer and the Word DEITUS”. For six months he carried out in earnest the Task of the Magus , presenting the Word DEITUS to the Satanic World. The Demonic Bible and other documents of the Embassy of Lucifer were published freely on the Internet, not for profit or prestige but simply to advance the Aeon of Lucifer. The words THELEMA, XEPER, DEITUS were used together in order to emphasize to Satanists that they must “Will to come into being as gods!” and that only through THELEMA and XEPER can DEITUS be understood. While the Embassy of Lucifer enjoyed great success during the short time it was active on the Internet, Magus Susej felt that most people were simply not ready to accept DEITUS since the Aeon of Lucifer followed so quickly the Aeon of Horus and subsequent Aeon of Set. Most who sought membership in the Embassy of Lucifer"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 did not actually understand the concepts presented... he, himself, did not fully understand the deeper meaning or significance of the Word he had spoken. He needed time to reflect on the significance of this Word and so left the Embassy of Lucifer and went into seclusion. If DEITUS is the Word of the Aeon, he said, it would have its effect with or without his direct involvement. Since his arrest in October 1999, Tsirk has put his criminal past behind him. He now works as a Network Technician and a Consultant in Computer and Network Security. In 2002 he became involved in the Baha’i Faith, a religious group wh ich believes Baha’ullah, a Persian nobleman of the late 19 th century, to be the most recent “Manifestation of God”. He has spent the past four years studying the Baha’i writings and the religious texts of other major world religions. His experience in proclaiming DEITUS as the Word of the New Aeon had convinced him that the prophets of the world’s great religions (Hinduism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, etc.) were influenced by the same Dark God that dictated the Book of the Law and the Book of Coming Forth By Night . Key to this belief in a commonality between Satanism (and other religions of the Left-hand-path) and th e Baha’i Faith (and other religions of the Right-hand-Path) are the words of Anton LaVey in the Satanic Bible who writes that “in an age of Ice god is above and in an age of Fire god is below.” Magus Susej points out that the revelation is the same... it is the individual approach which differs. Followers of the Right-hand-Path humble themselves before a perceived deity in the hope for some material or spiritual reward for their actions while followers of the Left-Hand-Path emulate a perceived deity in the hope for material and spiritual success. In all things there is an active principle and a passive principle... both must exist for there to be balance. Followers of the Left-hand-path need not “worship” God, for they are the very eyes, ears, minds, sinews, and hands of God (the active principle) carrying out His Will within the world. Now, after three years absence fr om the satanic community, Magus Susej has once again returned to lead the Embassy of Lucifer and to promote the Aeon of Lucifer. Soon, he says, man will be ready to embrace the Law of Deitus and accept his place as a god upon the earth . We have seen so many changes in the last few years. Technology now plays a central role in people’s lives. The surface of Mars is being explored. The human genome is being mapped.

There is much more to being a god than merely wielding power over others. We must accept the responsibility of actually being gods and act appropriately.

The ecclesiastical arm of the EoL was known as the Church of Lucifer (COL). The EOL received a small amount of publicity (and caused a minor uproar in a small northern community in British Columbia, Canada) when Magus Susej attempted to have the COL added to the “Churches” sign at the edge of town and placed in the “Churches” listing in the local pape r. Despite concern from the local populace, the COL had less than a dozen members at the time. After the public uproar, the EOL went underground. In honor of the Egyptian Lord of the Underworld, the EOL also became known as the Order of Anubis. Magus Susej began publication of an underground newsletter the Black Jackal and in the dread pages of this tome published, for the first time, his own system of magic The Demonic Bible . The Jackal enjoyed a small distribution for about a year and EOL membership grew steadily over the next few years until it reached about fifty people. By 1996, however, the EOL had become in active. Magus Susej considered the Embassy of Lucifer to be merely the foreshadowing of a much T"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 greater organization... one which would usher in a new stage in man’s evolution. In the year 2000, Magus Susej’s magical experiments with aeonics over the previous decade culminated in the discovery of the Word DEITUS as the magical dictum for the Aeon of Lu cifer. In year 1 AeL, Magus Susej reestablished the Embassy of Lucifer in order to advance the Word DEITUS and promote the Aeon of Lucifer. In the same year, the ecclesiastical arm of the EOL, was also reestablished as the Royal Church of Lucifer (RCOL). Over the next six months, Magus Susej used the EOL to carry out the Task of the Magus and promote the Word DEITUS as the Word of the Aeon of Lucifer. The EOL enjoyed great success under his guidance and grew quickly to include twenty-five consulates in ten countries... several hundred members. With the exception of a few gifted individuals, most who sought membership in the EOL were eager and curious but lacked any serious understanding of the concepts put forth. Magus Susej needed time to reflect on the deeper significance of the Word DEITUS and, therefore, left the EOL to pursue a deeper study of religious history. The International Office of the Embassy of Lucifer was temporarily closed leaving regional consulates to continue on their own initiative. Those gifted individuals who understood th e Law of the Aeon of Lucifer, “Will to come into being as a God,” would apply deitic philosophy to their lives and continue without the guidance of the EOL. Those who did not understand the philosophy would fall away and gain nothing from their experience. Now, three years since the closure of the International Office, Magus Susej has returned and the doors of the EOL have opened once again. As before, the goals of the EOL are multifold. Firstly, to put forward the Word DEITUS as a magical dictum for the Aeon of Lucifer and promote the Law of the Aeon of Luci fer (“Will to Come Into Being as A God.”) Secondly, to unite Satanists throughout the world and thereby become a more powerful force to a ffect change. Thirdly, work with other satanic groups and organizations to promote Unity and Diversity within the Satanic Community . Fourthly, to establish an independent and sovereign state modeled after the city -states of the pre-Christian pagan world with a system of government and law based upon satanic ethics rather than the outdated moral code of Christianity. And fifthly, serve as a diplomatic embassy of this future Satanic State."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 These goals fall into two broad roles which may be summarized as the role of the EOL as a magical and philosophical temple and the role of the EOL as a political and diplomatic organization. As a magical and philosophical temple, the EOL draws heavily from the philosophy of those temples which preceded it (th e TOS, ONA, COS, OTO/AA, etc.) and builds upon the work of Michae l Aquino, Aleister Crowley, and others. The EOL also contributes a new magic (the Demonic Bible) and a new philosophy ( deitic philosophy) with which others may experiment. As a political and diplomatic organi zation, the EOL places itself apart from any particular religious organization. Membership in the EOL does not preclude membership in the Church of Satan, the Temple of Set, the Ordo Templi Orientis, the Masons, or any other fraternal, religious, or secular organization. The RCOL, the ecclesiastical arm of the EOL, has been disbanded due in part to the potential for conflict with certain organizations but also for its irrelevance to the goals of the EOL. As a magical temple, the EOL is open to anyone who shares its philosophical approach. And as a diplomatic organization, the EOL has worked, and will continue to work, in cooperation with other organizations which share similar objectives. The EOL is not a church and it must be stressed that it is not in competition with any other satanic church or religious organization. The political objectives of the EOL bear mention only in passing since they have little relevance to this, the Third Edition of the Demonic Bible. The EOL is only relevant as a magical and philosophical temple which has applied the rituals and ph ilosophical concepts presented by Magus Susej in the Demonic Bible and in its role as the vehicle for the promotion of the Word of the Ae on and the Law of the Aeon of Lucifer. Like the Demonic Bible, like the system of magic presented herein, and like the deitic philosophy put forward by Magus Susej, the EOL is an evolving organism. What it is now, is not what it will be ten years from now. Anything written about the EOL will surely be false a few years hence. The EOL is, for DEITUS, what the OTO was for THELEMA. The OTO embraced much more than the philosophy of THELEMA, but ultimately served as a vehicle for the advancement of THELEMA.

At his me ntal peak, he experiences great clarity of thought and profound realization. And at his low, he experiences depression, anger, or me lancholy. Drugs, chemicals, foods and lifestyle changes may affect his thought processes in various ways. Disregarding for the moment the objective existence of spirits or demons, ritual magic is a way to control the mind. Without the use of drugs or chemicals, the magician cont rols directly his level of conscious awareness. He experiences \"being awake\" mentally, a state which the mundane only experience after large amounts of coffee or other stimulants. The spirits or demons he calls upon exist within his subjective mind and respond to his invocations. As a magician progresses in the Magical Art, he ga ins control over his emotions and experiences more \"peaks\" than \"lows\". The objective existence of spirits or demons does not need to be proven in order to show the effectiveness of magic. Parapsychologists have shown, through years of research and investigation which only the most cynical will deny, the definite existence of telepathy or mental communication. The human brain operates, like a radio, receiving the I"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 brain waves \"broadcast\" by others of similar frequency. For this reason, telepathy is most common among close friends or family members. A magician may be seen, then, as someone who has converted the \"receiver\" of his brain into a \"transmitter.\" At first he may only be able to influence those who are on a simila r \"frequency\" to his own or will have to learn how to change \"frequency\" in order to influence those on different \"frequencies\". But the more powerful his \"transmitter\" becomes, the more people he will be able to influence directly. The quickest and most direct route to the brain is through the optic nerve. Mental transmissions from th e brain are sent through the optic nerve to the eyes and out through the eye cavities. This is the origin of the \"evil eye\" and \"fascination\", as well as the expression \"the eyes are the window to the soul.\" In the Middle Ages, witch-hunters used to remove the eyes of \"witches\" so that they would not be able to look upon them and curse them. Once a magician has acquired control of his own mental states (through ritual magic), and has converted the \"receiver\" in his brain into a \"transmitter\", he is able to \"influence\" rather than \"be influenced\". He may even feel contempt for those who are led around upon rash emotional whims without the slightest balance or direction. Many people carry around with them subconscious masochistic tendencies, causing them to do things which will bring pain or misery upon themselves. In magical terminology, this is called a \"curse\". In its most severe form, the human mind becomes unbalanced, resulting in mental illness, paranoia, psychosis, or schizophrenia. Many people have \"cursed\" themselves or have been \"cursed\" by others, either intentionally or unintentionally. Wishing to place a curse on his enemy, an accomplished magician (someone who has mastered the mental states of his consciousness) may enter into a ritual chamber (enter into a \"waking state\" in which his mind is fully active), invoke a spirit of destruction (create the mental image of the spirit within his subjective mind), and command the spirit to go forth and destroy his enemy (send out the mental \"transmission\" of hate.) It matters not weather spirits exist objectively or no t. They are real to the magician who invokes them and to the victim who suffers the force of the mental \"transmission\". "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 If spirits or demons exist objectively, as actual intelligent beings, then one might think that they would have more important things to do than appear before a \"magic circle\" and serve the whims of mere mortals. One might also think that there would then be one \"correct\" tradition of magic and one \"true\" pantheon of deities. This is not at all the case. All systems of magic use similar technique s and work relatively the same. The fact that magic based on the wors hip of pagan gods has the same efficiency as magic based on the Hebrew Cabala and Christian Gnosticism, shows that it is the techniques used (and their effect upon the practitioner's mind) which accounts for magical powers and not the particular deities or spirits called upon. Many spirits are accredited with givi ng knowledge of \"arts and sciences\". The \"Lesser Key of Solomon\", a book of goetic sorcery, lists 72 demons which Solomon allegedly bound inside a brazen vessel. This Cabalistic tale has its origin in the Babylonian legend of the 72 Lords of the Djinn. The word demon comes from the Greek \"daemon\", an influencing spirit of intelligence. Djinn (or genie) is al so the root of the word \"genius.\" Although the word \"genius\" is often used by the mundane, he who is called a \"genius\" is said to be un der the influence of an intelligence, daemon, or genie. If demons do not exist objectively (only subjectively), then the question arises: how can we explain sudden knowledge acquired through contact with a spirit? Parapsychologists, in the study of telepathy, clairvoyance, and precognition, have only been able to prove the existence of telepathy. The reason for this is that, while there is a great deal of evidence concerning the precognition of future events, it can always be attributed to telepathic communication. The sa me is true of clairvoyance and clairaudience. The clairvoyant who sees the spirit of a woman's dead grandfather standing beside her does not see the actual spirit of the man but, instead, reads the mind of the woman and, from the image of the man in her mind, imagines him as a spirit. In dealing with the question of \"acquired\" knowledge, we may consider that all knowledge humankind has acquired resides in someone's mind. Reading the mind of an unknown subject thousands of miles distant, the magician may acquire instant knowledge of various \"arts and sciences\". This does not prove the objective existence of dem ons, only the ability of the human mind to become a powerful \"receiver\" and \"transmitter\" of telepathic signals. Unlike the mundane, who are influenced continuously by thoughts which are not their own, the magician may \"receive\" the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 information he desires without being c ontrolled by the desires or aims of others. There is an interesting phenomenon which occurs in magic and which involves the creation of thought-forms. The magician can create an image within his subjective mind and \"impose\" it upon the objective world so that it influences the subjective minds of all those individuals who come into contact with it. Objects may be charged with this magical energy and become \"charmed\" or \"cursed\". Within a magical group or coven a group-consciousness de velops and acts as if it were an individual entity. These thought-form s are also responsible for buildings and locations assuming an aura; beco ming \"sacred\", \"holy\", \"defiled\", \"unholy\", etc. Thought-forms were used by Egyptian magicians to guard burial chambers and resulted in the de aths of archeologists thousands of years later. This phenomenon cannot be explained by telepathy but is rather a form of magnetism or mesmerism, concerning which much research has also been done. The question arises: If spirits or demons are invoked by the magician and exist within his subconscious mind, do they also assume an objective existence (as thought-forms) separate from the magician himself? Do gods and deities exist simply on account of man's belief in and worship of them as such? If this is, in fact, the case then the magician may use telepathic (and vocal) communication to communicate with (summon) all manne r of gods, angels, and demons as well as to control the minds of other men. Having given you a completely rational explanation for magic, I must now point out that magic will not work if it is approached from an intellectual perspective. The reason for this is that Magical Art is the domain of the right-side of the brain, the part responsible for artistic talent, and not the left-side of the brain, the part responsible for logic and reason. It is the subconscious mind, the irrational mind, the artistic mind with its dreams, fantasies, and intuitions which is responsible for the \"reception\" and \"transmission\" of these telepathic signals. Beneath the surface of man's conscious mind is a world of fantasy and wonder to which the rational mind is an \"outcast\". As long as the rational mind is excluded from the subconscious, it will question the existence or importance of anything involving the subconscious to which it is not a part. Hence, the skeptic will question the validity of magic even when he is influenced subconsciously by the will of others. Only He who would practice the Magical Art need believe in its power."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 The Dynamic Universe n considering the true nature of God, one must first consider the nature of man and of the universe, for without understanding himself or the universe in which he lives how can man approach an understanding of God? Each man possesses a consciousness independent of any other creature. He is aware of a separation between himself and the world around him. He experiences images, sounds, scents, tastes, and physical forms through what he perceives as his physical body. He also experiences thoughts, emotions, and other phenomena which do not manifest either visibly or audibly but which influence him nonetheless and which he perceives as coming from \"within\" his consciousness. From the earliest times, man has attempted to reconcile this condition of \"separation from the universe\". Early man, in terror of the images and sounds which bombarded him from all directions and of the earth which seemed ready to swallow him once more as if the universe itself realized that it had made a terrible mistake, scared of this thing called \"life\" and yet equally scared of death, began to imagine hideous gods and demons all about him.

As man survived fire and flood, disease and famine, the anxiety he felt concerning his condition lessened. Man learned to live and even thrive in a hostile and evil world. Civilizations rose to power and rose up animistic deities as gods who now demanded worship and sacrifice in return for their beneficence and blessing. The threat was no longer against an individual man but against an entire society. To gain the favor of the gods, these deities had to be appeased or else famine, pestilence, or war might come upon a nation and destroy it. Ultimately, the priests of many of thes e gods decided that their particular deity was the true god, that all other gods were devils, and that the followers of other gods had to be converted or destroyed. Egypt was decimated by the Osirians as they attempted to eliminate the earlier religion of Set. In the Middle East, the Hebrews went to war with the surrounding nations to annihilate th em. Out of the cults of Baal and Osirus, Tammuz and Dmuzi, Mithra and Zoroaster, arose a sacrificial- god religion which would dominate Europe for centuries to come. The age of paganism had ended and the age of theocracy had begun. Long after the purpose of the gods they represented had passed, theocracies used their \"divine\" authority to wa ge religious wars against supposed \"infidels\" and persecutions of non-believers. Many people today have rejected the established religions of the past. This is natural when you consider that, while society has changed, the teachings and doctrines of these religions have not changed in over a thousand years. Many cannot reconcile the values and beliefs of society with the values and beliefs of the dominant religions within society. We are at a point in history where the do minant religions of the past will be displaced by religions whose values are in greater accordance with society's values today. This is why many people have sought out new religions and have turned to Wicca and new age philosophies or to alternative religious cults such as Heaven's Gate and the Solar Temple. While cults devoted to new age mysticism or white light magic and spirituality have had some success among those seeking for \"something, ... anything spiritual\", due principally to Christianity's impoverishment of the ego and starvation of the intel lect, they are ultimately no more relevant to today's society than the religions of the past. The world is"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 searching for a religion which embra ces the scientific knowledge of today, recognizes the psychological nature of man, and perceives the potential of man to achieve far more than he has already, while holding to ethical beliefs and values held by society today, and possessing a willingness to change those values and beliefs in accordance with future changes in society. Despite some individuals who see in Satanism nothing more than anti-Christianity, a depraved religion of blasphemies or an expression for anti-social desires and impulses, the emphasis of Satanism on the ego and the intellect and its recognition of man's ultimate potential have made it th e one religion relevant in today's society. But to return to the question at hand, what is the true nature of God? If, by God, one is referring not to a specific deity man has devised but to a controlling force or intellect within the universe, then it is clear to me that God, like the universe and everything within the universe, is in a continuous state of change and evolution. What I am suggesting is that God, like matter, energy, or consciousness, is \"dynamic\" not \"static\". Descartes said, \"I think therefore I am,\" but is this really true? In that which I perceive as my \"mind\" there is a continuous stream of thoughts which flows through me like a river. But am I my thoughts or am I the thing in which my thoughts manifest? Is the river the water which fills the river, or is the river the rock and dirt over which the water flows? Or is \"river\" simply a name I have give n to that which I perceive from the visual image of water moving over ro ck and dirt? And yet, a river from one moment to the next is not the same river, for the water in the river is not composed of the same water pa rticles, and a man is not the same from one moment to the next, since his thoughts and impressions change with each passing moment. If a man thinks for a moment that he has achieved enlightenment and understanding, the pool of thought he calls consciousness stagnates and, as a cess-pool, breeds worms and stench es like a swamp. The science of today is the superstition of tomorrow and the genius of today the know- nothing of tomorrow, for as the universe evolves towards ever greater levels of consciousness the very concept of truth, enlightenment, or wisdom changes with it. I AM not, but am becoming. The universe IS not, but is becoming. And if I, who possess consciousness, am becoming, then the consciousness which guides and/or controls the universe, from which my consciousness has its source, must also be becoming. The dialectic method of thes is/anti-thesis and synthesis is the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 process by which the universal dynamic evolves. I am not my flesh or my blood. I am not my brain or my body. In realizing that the \"I AM\" of my being is pure consciousness, I realize that I am God; I am the universe made manifest. And that which I call Lucifer, the embodiment of wisdom and enlightenment, is also changing, is also becoming. It is within me, it flows through me, it is what the \"I AM\" of my being is. I am Lucifer. I am Satan. There is one thing common to all gods man has created. Every man- made god is static and unchanging. Yahweh resides in heaven, unchanging, unbending, the creator of the universe and all that it contains. Christ sits at the right hand of God ready to judge the living and the dead. Zeus resides in Mo unt Olympus holding aloft the lightning bolt, his symbol of divine power. The values of society and the structure of its institutions are defined as \"good.\" That which threatens society is defined as \"evil.\" The defini tions of good or evil change from nation to nation and from century to century. God is defined by that which is \"static\" and unchanging. That which is \"dynamic\", a potential threat to the status-quo such as war, re volution, political unrest, or social upheaval, is represented by the Devil. But, if the universe is dynamic not static and consciousness is NOT but is becoming then the devil, Satan, more accurately reflects the true natu re of God than Christ, Yahweh, or any other image of God which man has defined. The Sumerians believed the Dragon of Chaos, Tiamat, to be the mother of the gods. The gods brought order to Chaos, but they were themselves the children of Chaos and subject to its laws and conditions. The devil was not originally a \"rebel\" agains t the order of creation but, the beginning and the end, the source of all creation. \"The dragon sleeps,\" we are told in the texts of old, \"but shall awaken.\" In the alchemical treatise, the Kybalion, it is said that \"the All is Mind\" and \"the Universe is Mental.\" The modern physicist, in accordance with this principle of alchemy that matter and energy are mental phenomena and that \"everything vibrates\", has stated th at the electrons and protons within the atom are composed of waves with various charges and rates of vibration. The Universe is not, but is BECOMING! God is not, but is BECOMING! When Lucifer has risen, when man has become God, then it shall be known that the Aeon of Lucifer has begun."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 Concerning Christianity he earliest Christians approach ed Christianity as a philosophy compatible with other philosophical beliefs. The Gnostic Christians saw no conflict between the Christian religion and the mystery schools of Greece and Rome. Among the Celts, Christianity was adopted by the Druids and was practiced alongside the earlier pagan religion. The Greeks and Romans a pproached Christianity from an intellectual perspective. The scriptures were accepted within the context in which they had been written and were not interpreted as the literal Word of God. The acceptance of Christianity as th e official religion of Rome (and creation of the Roman Catholic Church) signaled the end of this intellectual Christianity and the start of a new authoritarian Christianity. In its rise to dominance, the Churc h proclaimed earlier pagan religions to be forms of devil-worship and condemned millions of innocent men, women and children to death. Various Gnostic sects were among those executed. Intellectual freedom was suppressed and obedience to the Church was demanded. T"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 With the Age of Enlightenment and the eventual separation of church and state, a new emotional Chris tianity took the place of the authoritarian Christianity. The new Christianity espoused faith in Jesus, the person, as the savior of man and the redeemer of the world. The Bible was accepted as the living Word of God by those claiming to be reborn in Christ. In emotional fervor many Christians would take up serpents, speak in tongues, and witness miracles performed by faith healers. This is the Christianity we ha ve been left with today, a religion of blind faith and superstition - in tolerant of all others faiths. Many have rejected Christianity today because of what they see as the utter ridiculousness of its ceremonies and the complete ignorance of its followers. There is much wisdom to be found in Christian scripture, however, if the reader has time to study the many books which have been published in the Bible. It must be born in his mind that many other \"holy books\" have been written which have not been included in the Bible and that, in addition to \"inspired\" writings like the Bible and the Koran, there is much wisdom to be found in the writings of the many philosophers throughout history. Only by accepting the Bible for what it is, a book written by men and not th e \"living\" Word of God, can one approach a true understanding of these scriptures. Read from a \"satanic\" perspective, the Bible reveals itself as a history of Hebrew magicians and sorcerers. In a careful reading of the Bible, the prophets of the Old Testament are s hown to be practitioners of the Black Arts and Jesus Christ, in his stance against hypocrisy and self- righteousness, is revealed as a great Satanic Priest and Black Magician. To the inquiring mind it is clear wh y the Magi of Persia (the Wise Men), were the first to acknowledge the birth of Christ, for through their Magical Art and the practice of Astr ology, they recognized him as a naturally born magician. The eighteen lost years of his life were surely spent in the east studying the know ledge of the Magi. The practitioner of the Black Arts may be the truest Christian and he who would follow the Dark Path set out in this book the truest Apostle of Christ."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 Magical Words ords hold a special significance for the magician. When the magician speaks, he causes change to occur in the atmosphere around him. The vibrations caused by his words take the form of sounds. These sounds may tr avel great distances and attract the attention of others. Thus, invocation is and has always been at the center of ceremonial ritual. A magici an may desire something but desire is not enough to cause change. When he expresses his desire in words, his thoughts are manifested to the world. Cabalistic magicians believed that the Infinite and unknowable Deity (GOD) created the universe by speaking a Word. That Word was YHVH, or Yahweh. This was the Sacred Four-Letter Word of the Hebrews which was only ever spoken in secret and in whispers. The letters YHVH represented the elements Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, thus signifying the physical manifestation of the Infinite Deity.

When Chr ist says that he is “I AM” and the “Living Water”, he equates himself with the Yahweh of the Old Testament which was the physical manifestation of the Infinite Deity. In the Gospel according to St. John is written: \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God... and the Word became Flesh.\" Jesus was understood by the early Christians, and by the Gnostics, to be the manifestation of the Word, or the Logos. Words also held great significance for the Ancient peoples. The Babylonian god Marduk, for example, is given fifty names, powers of his Father Enki, by which he is able to defeat the dragon Tiamat and create from her corpse the earth and sea. Ishtar speaks the commanding words which open the gates of the Abyss when she descends into the earth and appears before the Throne of Ereshkigal, the goddess of death. Many other examples could be given of commanding words and controlling names being used in Sumerian, Babylonian, and Egyptian mythology. It has long been a part of magical init iation that the initiate receives a new name signifying his or her new life as a magician. A name, in this instance, is a word signifying what something means or who someone really is. In the Christian Bible when God fashions man from the dust of the earth and breathes into his body the br eath of life, and places him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it, and names him Adam, God causes all living creatures to come before Adam and Adam names all creatures. Whatever Adam names each creature, the Bible says, that is its name. The Bible's account of this event describes God, the Infinite and unknowable Deity, breathing his own essence into the clay and earth, calling it man, giving it dominion over the earth, the sea, and all things that are contained therein, and then bringing all creatures before man so that he can name them. It does not say that this dominion is over physical things only and not spiritual things. From a mystical perspective, the authority described in the Bible is primarily of a spiritual nature and refers to man being given authority over the spiritual world. Man is given the power to command spiritual beings and whatever man names each spirit that is its name."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 You may be familiar with the Persian version of the fall of Satan. In Persian mythology Lucifer fell from heaven not because of his pride but rather because of his love for God for, you see, he loved God so much that he would not bow down to and serve man whom God had created after the race of angels and who were inferior in every way to God's other creations. In Hebrew mythology, as well, Satan was not the enemy of God but rather the enemy of man. Having been cast out of heaven on account of man, Satan sought to prove man's infidelity to God by tempting him to sin. Hebrew religion, further, describes the \"Sons of God,\" the Nephilim descending to th e earth (perhaps after being cast out of heaven) and intermarrying with the daughters of man and having children with them. The Book of Enoch, one of the apocryphal texts of the ancient Hebrews, describes Azaz el and the other fallen angels teaching the arts of magic and enchantment to the race of man. It is from these ancient exiled beings that all magical knowledge is said to have come. The idea of magical aeons and words of power date back to Ancient Egypt, but has only become popular in recent years. Traditionally, a magician undergoes a period of initiation followed by many years of study before becoming an adept. The adept understands himself and is able to command the forces within and directly around him. The adept undergoes more life-changing experien ces before becoming a Master of the Temple. A Master of the Temple understands the magical universe and is able to affect change in far greater ways. A Master of the Temple may speak a magical Word which changes the magical universe or defines it in some new way. In doing this he may establish a new Law and create a new Aeon, or redefine an existing Law and existing Aeon. The act of speaking a Word is what separates a Magus from a Master of the Temple. Speaking a Word, declaring a Law, esta blishing an Aeon, or changing the magickal universe is an act which is aggressive and more characteristic of the Left-Hand-Path than the Right- Hand-Path. It requires strength of will to cause change within the universe. Since the RHP involves \"becoming one with\" the universe rather than affecting change within it, Magicians of the RHP may not advance beyond the grade of Magister Templi or Master of the Temple. Only a magician of the LHP is able to act independently upon the universe, and thus bring about change within it. Aeonic Words and Laws are, by there nature, Satanic."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 In 1904, Aleister Crowley declared the start of a new aeon, the Aeon of Horus. He claimed that the Aeon of Osirus, a period characterized by Christianity and other life-rejecting religions of the RHP, had come to an end. Crowley’s New Aeon was th e life-affirming Aeon of Horus, the bright conquering child. In Egyptian mythology, Horus is the son of Osirus and Isis, brought to life through the magic of Thoth from the seed of his dead father after Osirus was slain by his brother Set. Interestingly, Christianity would later echo many of the themes in Egyptian mythology. Osirus was slain on the night of the Winter Solstice and spent three nights in the underworld before being reborn (On December 25th) in the form of the god Horus. The title of Isis,\"mother of God,\" was later given to the Virgin Mary. Crowley's concept of the Aeon of Horus as a new life-affirming age seems contradictory in the light that Horus was an early form of Christ until one considers that this contradiction exists only with the mythology of the later period of Egyptian history. Horus was one of th e oldest deities of Egypt and was worshipped before the worship of Osirus had become dominant and Set had become redefined as the enemy of Osirus. The Word which Aleister Crowle y spoke in 1904 was the Word THELEMA, a Greek Word which means \"Will\". The Law of the Aeon of Horus is \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" Entire books have been written on the exact meaning of this statement. What this means to me is that the individual (the microcosm) is a manifestation of the Infinite Deity (t he macrocosm) an d the Will of an individual, therefore, is the Will of God. Or, in other words, Man is God. Many people want things which are in conflict with their true natures.

For starters, this does not mean \"Do whatever you feel like doing when you feel like doing it.\" If this were the case, then a lot of people would go around acting on violent and anti-social impulses. Your Will has more to do with your true destiny or purpose in this world. It represents who you really are, as an individual, even if you do not recognize it at a conscious level. You create your dest iny by acting (or not acting) upon your Will. Following your Will may mean going against everything you have been taught to believe in and surrendering everything you hold as valuable. For example, you may have been taught as a child that materialism is good only to find that possessions make you unhappy. In such a case, giving up your possessions and living a life of poverty will give you greater happiness since it is not your will to acquire material success. T"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 Good and evil are subjective terms. When someone causes you pain or hurts you, you may call him evil. Whe n someone or something benefits you, you may say it is good. Because the world is filled with many individual beings each acting (o r not acting) upon individual Will, conflict is inevitable. It is important to realize that conflict occurs not because one group is evil and anothe r group is good, or because one person is wrong and another person is right, but rather because their individual wills are in conflict. In every situational conflict involving two or more people resolution will only occur when one Will prevails, otherwise there will be a stand-o ff which will prolong the conflict inevitably. The Will acts at a social level as we ll as on a personal/individual level. The majority in our society imposes its collective Will upon society (and the majority of \"national\" wills im pose their collective Will upon the world.) This is why values within a society change with each passing generation. When an individual Will c onflicts with the social will conflict results (viz. imprisonment, persecution, etc.) Courts, prisons, and police forces are the tools used by society to enforce the collective will of the majority within society upon those indi viduals who either do not wish to follow the laws of society or whose individual wills differ from the collective will of the majority. But, if there is no good and no evil, th en the only true “evil” is to deny your will and act against it. Many time s in history, a man thought to be a criminal has become a national hero and a man called a fool has later been thought a genius. How we are judged by society at this point in time may not be how we are judged in a decade or in a century. All you can do is act upon your Will and let others be damned! Love occurs when two beings Will to become one, or when the Will of one is to sacrifice himself for the other. In love, two Wills are brought together and become one. Aleister Crowley compared death to love since in death the Will of the individual surrenders to the Will of the universe. From the moment you are born, your ultimate purpose is to die. Death is, therefore, the ultimate expression of love... love for the universe. \"Love is the Law, Love and Will.\" XEPER is an Egyptian Word meaning to \"become\" or to \"come into being\".

The synthesis of these two ideas becomes a new thesis which will face its opposite, and so on. The world, the universe, everything... is in a continuous state of change. If you remain as you are now you will be destroyed by the force of the universe as it becomes something altogether different from what it currently is. An example of this is finding your knowledge in your chosen profession or field obsolete because new graduates learn more than what you learnt when you were in university. You must be forever learning, growing, evolving into something different than what you are now. DEITUS is a new Word for a new Aeon. It is the realization that man's consciousness is eternal and omnipotent. It is, further, the realization, that the individual Will is a direct manifestation of the Will of the Universe. The Law of the Aeon of Lucifer is THELEMA, XEPER, DEITUS or \"Will to come into being as a God.\" When you attain DEITUS, you become a manifestation of the dynamic consciousness of the universe... you become the very embodiment of God or Satan.

What the sorcerer desires (or thinks that he desires) may not be the thing which his \"higher self\" has truly willed to occur. Expanding upon the Law of Thelema, Michael Aquino conceptualized and proclaimed the Word XEPER, by which the sorcerer may \"become\" and ultimately attain his true WILL and the realization of his \"higher self\".

XEM may be any destination, but realizing that man's ultimate goal is to become God, XEM becomes DEITUS. DEITUS is the achievement of the power of a God. To become a God, man must realize that he is a God. It has been commonly believed that God created the universe. It is actually the universe which is creating God. Satan is a metaphor for man. The rise of Lucifer is the rise of man to his eventual destiny. The Aeon of Lucifer did not utterly destroy the Aeon of Set, but augmented it. Set is the \"dynamic\" of the universe, the source consciousness which - through man - is creating God. \"The Word of the Aeon is - DEITUS - for man has become God, Lucifer has risen, the dragon has awakened, the gates have been flung wide and the heavens have been conquered. The Ancient Ones rule once more. By your WILL alone, the genetic code of man has been altered. By THELEMA and by XEPER, you are now DEITUS! A new race, a superior race, has been born.

DEITUS could not have been procla imed as an Aeon enhancing word within the Aeon of Set since it changed this relationship between man and the universe. The Aeon of Isis was a time when man lived in close harmony with the natural world and the dominant religions involved the worship of nature (the pre-Christian pagan world.) The Aeon of Osirus, which followed it, was a time when man rejected the natural world, accepting self-denial and sacrifice of the flesh and body as the ideal.

This was followed by the Age of Satan which began April 30, 1966 when Anton LaVey spoke the words \"Indulgence instead of Abstinence,\" thus breaking the power of Christianity over its followers. Wi th the Age of Satan, man was once again free to celebrate his carnal ex istence. The Aeon of Set began June 21, 1975 when Michael Aquino, Mag us of the Aeon of Set, spoke the Word XEPER. In the Aeon of Set, man would seek to attain full realization of his \"higher self\". The Aeon of Lucifer began May 5, 20 00 with the declaration of the word DEITUS, an event coinciding with extensive research being conducted in genetic manipulation and increasing international cooperation between scientists on the \"human genome project\". In DEITUS, man need no longer \"seek\" his higher self for by THELEMA and by XEPER he has \"attained\" it. DEITUS depends upon THELEMA and XEPER just as XEPER depends upon INDULGENCE, THELEMA and RESTRICTION. Man must pass through each preceding aeon in order to reach the current aeon. DEITUS does not involve the dissolution of man's consciousness into \"universal consciousness\". By dissolving his consciousness into the \"universal consciousness\" he would be unable to act separately and distinctly upon the universe and would thus be unable to ever attain DEITUS. DEITUS does not represent the end of \"becoming\" or the end of XEPER and REMANIFEST. To believe for a moment that he has reached the end of the road, that he has become a God, and that his journey is over, the sorcerer would be making a terrible mistake. The Aeon is itself \"becoming\" within the un iverse and the universe is itself expanding. By attaining DEITUS, th e sorcerer realizes that man is \"becoming a God” and “accepts his place as a god upon the earth.\" His consciousness expands to the limits of the current aeon and he then continues to XEPER and REMANIFEST in direct relationship to the universe. The sorcerer realizes that his consciousness and his will are a manifestation of the universal dynamic, which man calls SATAN."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 Having attained DEITUS, man becomes the very embodiment of SATAN.

If ever a man was not conscious he should still be unconscious. The order of the universe suggests the existence of a god but what created God? If energy cannot be created or destroyed then there is a finite amount but what created energy? The universe should not exist. Life should not exist. There is no logic. The reason for this is that the universe we experience is not the true reality... It is no more than a dream. Consciousness alone exists. A single consciousness alone exists, isolated in a void of nothingness. There is no God. There is no other consciousness be sides that of the One. It sleeps. It dreams. As it awakens from one dream, another dream begins. There is no reality for it to awake to. There is nothing outside of consciousness.

This is why man sees himself in others. What he hates in others is what he hates most in himself. What he fears in others is what he fears most in himself. What he loves in others is what he most wants to possess. How he treats his fellow man is a reflection of his true feeling towards his own consciousness. Those who worship \"God\" are fools, for they deny the reality of the one which exists within them. Those who fear \"God\" are frightened of shadows for there is nothing beyond consciousness. Descartes said, \"I think therefore I am,\" but what is thought? Why should man give more credit to the pound of organic matter he calls his \"brain\" than he does to rock or dirt? Can matter or energy produce consciousness? Can nerve cells within the brain \"think\" any more than stones upon the ground? If this were true, then man would be nothing more than a robot following out his \"programming\" as designed by nature. That which decays and rots in the ground is not the source of consciousness. Consciousness animates the material but it is not governed by it. The source consciousness is all that exists. The one is all that is real. A man's life is a river but what is a river? Is it the water which flows over rock and dirt, changing from moment to moment, or is it the riverbed over which the water flow, which changes also but over a much longer period of time. If the water is divert ed, the river dries up and a new river is formed. Can that which never existed die? Can it spend eternity in bliss or in torment? Can it be reinca rnated in another form? It cannot be said to die if it never existed. Only the consciousness which enlivened it exists. When consciousness is cut off by the end of flesh, it is diverted elsewhere creating new life. There is only consciousness and it is without end. The mystic says \"deny the ego, su rrender yourself to the universal consciousness.\" This is folly for by rejecting one's own consciousness, the universal consciousness which animates the individual is also rejected. If I am God made manifest, then my thoughts are the thoughts of a god and my actions are the acti ons of a god. My desires are the desires of a god and my will is the wi ll of a god. If I am \"good\" or I am \"evil\" then I am a god of goodness or a god of wickedness."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 The sadomasochistic nature of the universe becomes evident as one considers that the source consciousness which animates all things manifests as both predator and prey.

There is no sin in any action which is in accordance with one's will and desire.

While this is rarely the case due to the obvious danger that such acts entail, anyone who has studied the nature of magic will understand the rationale behind such deviant practices. The magician who engages in this sort of activity is not a common sociopath or child molester who derives pleasure from torturing or killing an innocent victim. Rather, the magician in question draws on magical energy released by the emotionally charged victim and directs that energy to affect the world in some wa y. Aside from the legal dangers, the level of energy raised by such a ritual is too great for any but the most powerful wizard (or group of wizards) to control. It is all too common to hear Satanist s say things like “A Satanist would never kill a living creature.” These statements, made by those who want to promote a positive image of Sata nism, are clearly erroneous and are based on a Christian morality.

"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 DEITUS he purpose of this thesis is to elucidate upon the meaning and significance of the Word of the Aeon of Lucifer, DEITUS, and the Law of the Aeon of Lucifer, THELEMA, XEPER, DEITUS or Will to Come Into Being as a God. In so doing, I will also discuss the Demonic Bible, the system of magic revealed to me by my Unholy Guardian Demon, the spirit Azael, and the Embassy of Lucifer, the vehicle for the advancement of DEITUS as the Word of the Aeon of Lucifer. This thesis may, therefore, serve as a commentary on the Demonic Bible as well as an exposition on deitic philosophy and magic. As stated in the Preface to the 2 nd Edition, the Demonic Bible is not a “work of fiction” but is rather the foundation of what is now known as deitic magic. The roots of deitic magic lie in thelemic (as practiced by the O.T.O./A.A.) and setian magic (from the Church of Satan/Temple of Set tradition), but is also heavily influenced by the septenary system of the O.N.A. It is only by THELEMA and XEPER that one can attain DEITUS. An understanding of thelemic and setian philosophy is therefore necessary for an understanding of many of the concepts presented in the Demonic Bible. This thesis will address thelemic and setian philosophy as it relates to an understanding of DEITUS. Let us begin, then, by considering the basic precepts of satanic belief. The start of satanic enlightenment is the realization that all gods are T"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 created by man, all religions are esta blished by man, all “holy” books are written by man, and all temples are built by man... there is nothing spiritual, there is nothing holy. It ha s been said that man creates God in the image of himself and the devil in the image of his enemy. God is, it is remarked, a projection of man’s ego. The Satanist says, “Why worship a god someone else has created, and which represents someone else’s ego, when you can recognize a god of your own creation... a god which has your best interests at heart.” The Satanic view considers Satan as an archetype, a symbol of carnality as opposed to spirituality. The Satanist realizes that it is the overpowering fear of death which causes man to create heaven and hell, reincarnation, and all of the other fairy stories which deal with life beyond death. There is only the flesh. Satanists, therefore, delight in the pleasures of the flesh and in the joys that this world has to offer, and scoff at those who reject what they have been given for the hope for some illusory reward beyond death. Satanically speaking, churches are businesses which offer their followers the promise of “salvation.” In order for this con-game to succeed, a church must convince its followers that a) it is the only viable path to salvation, and b) without its service, they are going straight to hell. Churches have, therefore, attempted to suppress the human ego by making their followers feel guilt and shame for every natural inclination and suppress the human intellect by demanding blind faith and obedience. By suppressing the human ego, a church makes its followers feel inferior and remain in thrall to the institution. By suppressing the human intellect, a church keeps its followers from questioning the logic of its dictates. The Satanist asks, “Why should I feel guilty for that which is natural and healthy? Why should I not feel pride in that which I have accomplished? Why should I not question the logic of what I have been told?” Satanism encourages the de velopment of a healthy ego. Only when a person has a healthy ego, can he truly afford to treat others with respect and consideration. Satanism also encourages the development of a healthy intellect. Nothing shou ld be accepted without question; all things must be put to the test. Satanists are not devil-worshippers. There is, in fact, no form of worship in satanic ritual. Since all gods are created by man, Satanists"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 refuse to treat their creations as superior to themselves. The Satanist may call upon the names of various gods , and may even treat them as his equals, but he recognizes that they exist to serve him. The Satanist is his own god and his own redeemer. Just as he knows that there is no other god beyond himself, he knows that it is useless to pray for the things that he wants. He is ultimately responsible for his own success or failure. He must work hard and stri ve for the things which he desires. To accomplish his goals, the Satanist may choose to use magic in the performance of a satanic ritual. Ev ery religion has had some form of magic ritual or ceremony associated with it, but the Satanist realizes that magic represents the ability of the human mind to cause change in the natural world. In the Magical Art , I discuss the use of telepathic “transmissions” to influence others. Magic also involves magnetism, psycho kinesis, and the release of emotional energy from the magician. Satanic rituals are performed to focus the mind and direct the flow of energy. It has often been said that Satanist s perform human sacrifices or engage in other criminal acts such as molest ing children or killing animals. The rationale behind this is that the en ergy of the emotionally charged victim is released in the performance of the rite and directed within the ritual to accomplish the will of the magician. These types of crimes are very rarely ever committed by a Satanist for an obvious reason which has nothing to do with moral or ethical beliefs. A Satanist cares about what is best for him and would not engage in acts which would jeopardize his freedom or safety. The occasional deviant may commit some horrific crime in the name of Satan, but the Satanist is no more responsible for the crimes of the sociopath or chil d molester than a Christian is for those of a deviant priest or minister who does the same. While self-interest keeps the Satanist from breaking the laws or cultural standards of the society in which he lives, a Satanist may question the definition of good and evil and the values and ethics which his society has determined to be correct. “What is good and what is evil?” the Satanist asks. “If you kill for your country you are called a hero, but if you kill to avenge a wrong which has been done you are called a criminal.” Questions like this are common among Satanists for the Satanist realizes that the definition of right and wrong, of good and evil, changes from decade to decade and also from nation to nation. There is no absolute good or absolute evil. There are only man-made laws and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 codes of conduct. These laws and di ctates are written and rewritten to meet the demands of the society we live in. Occasionally, these laws are based on beliefs and values which ar e no longer accepted and must be changed. The Satanist questions all that he has been taught to believe. He realizes that history is written by the victors of every war... the winner becoming the hero and the defeated the villain. The values of the dominant society are the prevailing values of the world and it is by these values which the past is judged and the world’s future is determined. The Satanist recognizes that all id eologies, all political systems, all economic systems, and all governments are equally flawed. Once men went off to kill or die for their King and their God; now they do the same for “democracy” and “liberty.” But what is “liberty,” the Satanist may ask, “for those who must be killed to be “liberated?” All things are subjective and, therefore, nothing can accurately be judged except by its own standards and ideals. The Satanist condemns the Christian, not for his offences but rather, for his hypocrisy. All men will do what comes naturally to them and so the Satanist is not surprised to see th e Christian having sex, drinking, gambling, and engaging in other “sinful” pleasures. The Satanist does not even think badly of the Christian for doing such things. But the Satanist can only feel contempt fo r someone who preaches against the pleasures of the flesh and condemns others to eternal “damnation” while continuing to do these things himself. These men are out drinking and lusting after women on Friday night and then in church Sunday morning asking God to forgive them for their “sins” when they know they will be back out the followi ng weekend doing what they have always done. The Satanist rejects them because they are hypocrites, and judges them by the standards they have set. Why, you may ask, does the Satanist call himself a Satanist if he does not believe in the literal existence of the devil? The Satanist, of course, recognizes the importance of ritual and ceremony to satisfy certain human emotional needs. He sees no thing wrong with religion, and in fact considers it essential to human behavior, but recognizes that churches have used religion to manipulate the masses into obedience to their will. The Satanist chooses his own god, one which will not make him feel guilty for being human, one which will not condemn him for all his actions... the Satanist chooses a god who represents the very carnal"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 being who has the power to create a god in the first place. Every society has invented a deity who represents the carnal; in this particular society this being is called Satan. The Satanist does not worship Satan, but he chooses Satan as an archetype of carn ality. The god of the Satanist is within his own flesh and bone, within his skin tissues and muscle fibers. He is the god of life and the god of the flesh... he is the Dark Lord, Satan. The gods and demons which the Satanist may invoke, in the performance of satanic rituals, are archetypes associated with the “dark side.” These beings represent carnality rather than spirituality, life rather than death, and indulgence rather than repression. In the Magical Art, I make brief mention of the magician’s ability to impose a thought-form onto an object which can influence anyone who comes in contact with it. I suggest that this form of magnetism or mesmerism which is responsible for a place or object developing an aura makes it possible that a god or demon will take on an id entity, apart from the magician, as a thought-form. This is essentially a subjective existence, rather than objective existence, and the spirit is fundamentally archetypal in nature, but through the magician’s subconsci ous mind the spirit may assume an identity separate from the magician who summons him and act independent of the magician’s will. It is for this reason that certai n repressed individuals who have experimented casually with the “occ ult” have had horrific experiences and, abandoning further experimentati on, fled to the nearest church to seek forgiveness for their sins. The demons they encountered were the product of their own repressed emotions and fears of the unknown. If faced, with courage and fortitude, th e demons would have vanished and become once again shadows. The Satanist has no need for ouija boards or spirit cards since he has exercised the shells embedded in man’s subconscious. Neither does the Satanist require protective pentagrams and “Names” of God to protect him, or call upon the lesser minions of Hell for fear that the greater deities are too powerful to control. The Satanist calls brazenly upon the very Gods of Hell and Lords of the Abyss, realizing that they can in no way harm him for he is the master of his conscious and subconscious mind. Aleister Crowley defined magic k as “the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.” Anton LaVey took this definition farther by defining magic as, “The change in situations or"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 events in accordance with one’s will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable.” Magic is the effect of the human mind to change events or situations in accordance with one’s desire. The success of magic depends upon an unbending will, intense emotional desire, and absolute faith in the outcome. It also depends upon the proper timing, imagery, ba lance, direction, and secrecy about magical activities. Many books have been written which give spells or rituals to acquire love, wealth, and power, but the ability to use these spells effectively cannot be taught. In some it may come more naturally than in others, but magic is an art which can only be developed through experience. Satanists do not burn candles of va rious colors for various wishes, or sing “ring around the rosy” while dancing clockwise in a circle holding hands. Those who want to practice magic but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma attached to the practice of witchcraft and sorcery, call themselves “white witches ” and base eighty percent of their philosophy on the guild-ridden doctrines of Christianity. The Satanist looks with contempt upon these hy pocrites who denounce Satan with one breath while attempting to practi ce the very art which historically has been attributed to the Dark Lord. The Satanist recognizes that magic is magic, be it used to help or to hinder. The last page of the Demonic Bible is a diagram entitled the Map of the Spheres . The spheres illustrated are essentia lly archetypal. They have been described countless times in grimoires and magical treatises. In the physical world there are four elementa l spheres: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. There are also the four grea t watchtowers: North, East, South, and West. Above the earth are the seven planetary spheres: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Beyond the planetary spheres are the Fixed Stars and the Primum Mobil, the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and the heavenly spheres. Beneath the earth lies the land of the dead (Hades), the Tartaran Abode (Hell), and the realm of the abominations of Chaos. All spirits, demons, angels, and other beings of an archetypal nature are said to reside in one of the archetypal spheres. There are, for example, many ranks or orders of angels such as Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Powers, Virtues, Archangels, etc. Each angelic choir is said to reside in a particular heavenly s phere. Similarly, the fallen angels may reside in Earth, Air, Fire, Water, or in the Tartaric Depths. Spirits which"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 dwell in the planetary spheres are often called Olympic spirits. These include lunar, mercurial, venereal, so lar, martial, jovial, and sanguine spirits. Traditionally, all spirits may be invoked or summoned to appearance by the magician using certain formulas of invocation or evocation. Magicians of the Middle Ages would fast for many days and go without sleep or rest. They would also abstain from sexual intercourse and idle conversation in order to focus all of their attention on their magical art. They would pray to God fervently fo r the power to command the spirits and would then summon or invoke the spirits with threats and warnings to appear “peacefully and affably” ready to serve the whim of the magician. The grimoires warn that the magician dare not leave the circle of protection without discharging the spirit or err in the performance of the ritual or else the spirit will seize the magician and kill him or else drive him insane. Ironically, the magician would have to be insane to believe that the Great Adonai would grant him the power to command spirits in order that he might destroy his enemies, obtain great treasure, and fulfill his sexual desires with young virgins or that the demonic lords he calls upon would be so easily intimidated by his threats. If the magician sees a spirit appear within the triangle of evocation it is simply because his mental state from fasting, fatigue, and fervent prayer has brought him in the point of delusion. If the spirit appears but refuses to speak with him or to sati sfy his demands, the magician must continue his fast and make even more fervent prayer to God. To any sane mind it is clear that the formula of the grimoires can only lead to the ruin of the operator. When the magician reaches the point of total insanity he will finally hear the voices of the spirits and enjoy the treasures he has longed for, but he alone will hear the voices and his gold pieces will be bottle-caps and his diamonds rocks from the ground, and the demons will laugh him to scor n for his greed as he dies alone and miserable, a wretch of a man. The rituals of the grimoires are a trap to ensnare the deluded. They set the magician upon a downward cycl e of self-destruction. The flaw inherent in every grimoire is that the magician is instructed to command the spirit to appear visibly and to satisfy his demands. In order for the operator to see the spirit visibly, he must re ach a point of total insanity. If the spirit does not appear visibly, then the spirit has failed to satisfy the first demand of the operator, an d it is unlikely anything the operator"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 asks of the spirit will come to pass. As I have said, the success of magic depends upon will, desire, and faith. Every time a spirits fails to appear (as the operator has not yet become delusional) it will chip away a little at his strength of will and faith in his ability thus acting against the magician. The Demonic Bible provides invocations for many demons. These spirits are treated, however, as archetypal forms and no attempt is made to force the spirit to appear visibly or to speak with the operator. Neither is any demand made of the spirit. If you lust after a certain woman and call upon a particular dem on to bring her to you, you may very well enjoy that which you have asked of the spirit... at least for a time. But my experience has been that most relationships do not last. People change, grow, improve themselves, and they move on to new and greater experiences. It may happ en even that you do not get the thing you demanded of the spirit. Failure in this matter is not an option. The magician must have absolute certainty that everything he asks for will come to pass or in a moment of doubt lose everything he has so carefully worked for. By the practice of magic, the magician may develop great power but this power should not be used lightly. It should not be wasted on things of little importance. The magician may fi nd that every time he mentions to a friend or an associate that he needs or wants a particular item that the thing comes to him. He may also find that he has much greater confidence and is able to influence people in subtle ways without them realizing that they are being influenced. As his ability grows, the magician begins to exercise his will in the world in, at first, minor ways and then in major ways. This, however, is what is, traditionally, called “Lesser Magic” since it involves the direct application of the Will rather than the performance of a ritual or ceremony. “Greater Magic,” magic involving the invocation of spirits, should not be abused. Rather than commanding the demon to bring you the woman you desire, learn from the spirit and attempt to become more like it. Eventually you will become a living demon of lust and will enjoy the pleasure of many women. I say, ther efore, that ritual magic should be used only for the invocation of spirits and for increasing your knowledge and power (through identification with the spirits that you invoke) and not for the conjuration of lust, compassion, or the destruction of your enemies. This is a general rule and there may be extreme occasions"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 when it is absolutely necessary to perform a ritual of destruction or a ritual of compassion. A ritual may be performed to enhance the operation of “Lesser Magic” but must never be used in place of “Lesser Magic.” If the magician performs a ritual to obtain his desire and then does nothing himself to make his wish a reality, expecting the demon to bring it about independent of his own actions, he will surely fail in his endeavor. Near the end of the Demonic Bibl e is an invocation entitled the General Invocation for Calling any of the Spirits and a listing of the archetypal devils, demons, and dark gods I have invoke d using this formula. The wording of the invocation is not important and sigils, or seals, for the spirits are not necessary. A name when written is a word composed of letters each signifying a sound. The syllables (and sounds) which make up a name identify a particular being which religion, metaphysics, mythology, demonology, folklore, or legend has said to exist. Each name represents a unique archetypal being which the magician may identify himself with, bringing about various changes within his psyche. Even where different names have been given to the same archetypal being or where one name is derived from another, each name is a unique creation. Some of the archetypes may be similar in nature and others may be wildly different, but each is unique. Asmodee, Asmoday, and Asmodius; Astarot, Astaroth, Astarte, and Ishtar; Satan, Shaitan, Shiva, and Set are each unique archetypal forms. The archetypal spheres and archetypal spirits I have described thus far exist (subjectively) because man has de fined them to exist. Some will argue that these gods and demons are real beings who have revealed their existence in the past and that the knowledge of these beings together with the knowledge of the as tral planes on which they dwell has been passed down in religion and mythology. It is more likely, however, that these beings take on an appare nt existence because people believe in them. The psychologist Carl Jung, fascinated with metaphysics, alchemy, and dream interpretation, considered that gods and demons existed as symbolic forms in the subconscious mind. Further, he suggested that there was a collective subconscious shared by all humanity and that symbols in dreams had universal meanings. With this in mind, the spheres described in the Map of the Spheres may be seen as planes of consciousness on each of which the symbols share a common theme. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 The Map of the Spheres shows the Aeonic Sphere as being beyond the heavenly spheres. The Aeonic Sphere could be described as a circle surrounding all of the spheres since it is closest to the universal subconscious. Traditionally, a magi cian begins as a novice or neophyte and over time becomes an adept. The adept continues to advance in knowledge and eventually becomes a Magister Templi (or Master of the Temple). This process is called “Initiation” and, in magical orders, is marked by various membership degrees and the performance of rituals or ceremonies intended to signify that the magician has entered a new stage in his career. The Magister Templi may ultimately “cross the abyss”, come face to face with his true self or “Holy Guardian Angel,” and become a Magus. The Magus sp eaks a “Word” which creates a new “aeon” or changes an existing “a eon”, and establishes a “Law.” It may be more accurate (but less poetic), however, to say that the magician views the tide currents of the Aeonic Sphere and codifies what he sees as a trend or theme into a pa rticular Word or magical dictum. In truth, all aeons are one aeon... they differ as waves of an ocean. The ocean in this analogy is the universal subconscious... the source consciousness from which conscious thought arises. The aeons affect all humanity since they exist in the universal subconscious. Like waves of the ocean, each aeon causes new aeons to form. We may speak of a particular cycle in which many aeons come into existence. The ocean of the universal subconscious has tide currents of its own. When the tide is “coming in” the cycle is one of restriction and when the tide is “going out” the cycle is one of expansion. The number and frequency of aeonic words is greater near the start of a cycle because of the change in the current from one of restriction to one of expansion. It is for this reason that the Aeon of Horus, Aeon of Set, and Aeon of Lucifer have followed so quickly one upon another. All of these aeons have the same theme and are part of the cycle of expansion which began in 1904 CE. The difference is that each aeon builds upon the previous aeons. We may see the creation of a new aeon within the next decade but eventually the current of the cycle will be entirely one of expansion no longer affected by the past cycle of restriction. When this is the case, centuries will pass between new aeonic words. In another two-thousand year, the cycle of expansion w ill have ended and humanity will experience another cycle of restriction. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 Aleister Crowley made reference to the Aeon of Isis, a time when man lived in harmony with the natural world and the dominant religions involved the worship of nature. He was referring, of course, to the pre- Christian pagan world. This was followed, he said, by the Aeon of Osirus, a time of restriction in which man rejected the natural world and in its place chose denial of the ego and mortification of the flesh. He believed that a new Aeon, the Aeon of Horus, had begun. In Egyptian mythology, Isis was the goddess of fertility, Osirus was the god of death, and Horus was the god of rebirth. The period of restriction, he said, had ended and the life-energies had returned to the world. The pre-Christian pagan world was more, however, than simply a time of nature worship. Men lived in greater harmony with the natural world than they did during the cycle of restriction which followed, but they also celebrated the carnal, exalted the ego, and explored deep philosophical thought. This was the time of the mystery schools and the philosophers of Greece. This was th e time of the great empires of Babylon and Rome. This was the time when men discovered Astronomy, Mathematics, and Scienc e. The Aeon of Isis was not a single aeon but a succession of aeons in a cycle of expansion. The religions which rose during this time involved the worship of fire or of planetary bodies: the sun, the moon, and the stars. 2100 years ago, the previous cycle of expansion ended and the cycle of restriction, which Crowley calls the Aeon of Osirus, began. Like the Aeon of Isis, the Aeon of Osirus wa s not a single aeon but a succession of aeons in a cycle of restriction. The fact that the Aeon of Osirus was not a single aeon with one Law is evidenced by the fact that there were many religions established during th e cycle and many sects within each religion. There were also many different concepts as to who God was and what was expected of man from God. It may be said that the Law of the Aeon of Muhammed was “There is One God and Muhammed is His Prophet.” It may also be said th at the Law of the Aeon of Christ (or Aeon of St. Paul) was “Only through the Son can you approach the Father.” The significance of this is that all aeons established within the cycle of restriction had a common theme: rejection of the natural world, denial of the ego, repression of huma n needs, mortification of the flesh, and obedience to church and state. Crowley identified that a new cycle of expansion had begun and the cycle of restriction had ended. He re fered to this cycle as the Aeon of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 Horus but the Aeon of Horus was only the first of many aeons within the cycle he had identified. The god Osirus had passed through the land of the dead and was now reborn as Horus. The bright and glorious child was reborn and now sat upon the throne of his father. This fit beautifully into Crowley’s Egyptian schema but the doctrine of Thelema failed to transform the world as he believed it would. The religion of Crowley-anity attracted few followers at the time but the child grew and was weaned. And in 1966 it went out to play with its friends. Anton LaVey referred to a cycle of expa nsion as an Age of Fire and to a cycle of restriction as an Age of Ice. The Age of Ice had ended, he said, and a new Age of Fire had begun. LaVey’s Age of Fire was Crowley’s Aeon of Horus and LaVey’s Age of I ce was Crowley’s Aeon of Osirus. It was another way of expressing the same truth. The Age of Fire began in 1904 with Crowley’s revelation in the desert but 1966 marked the beginning of the second aeon within the cycle of expansion... the Aeon of Set. The period from 1966 to 1975, often called the Age of Satan, was a transitional period between the Aeon of Horus and the Aeon of Set. The Age of Satan represents the time during which both aeons were active. In 1975, the Aeon of Hor us had finally ended. The Aeon of Lucifer, similarly, began in 1991. The period from 1991 to the year 2000 was transitional. Both the Aeon of Set and the Aeon of Lucifer existed simultaneously during this time. The Aeon of Set ended in the year 2000. The bright, glorious, and unconquere d child had been reborn. It had grown from an infant to a child and then into a teenager. Crowley celebrated its birth. LaVey sent the child out to play with its friends. Aquino called the child in to study for its finals. The years of the Church of Satan were a carnival, followed by those of the Temple of Set and its focus on intellectual pursuits. At the end of the 20 th century, the child approached manhood. The year 2000, and the declaration of DEITUS as the Word of the Aeon of Lucifer, marked the beginning of the child’s adult years. The focus now is no longer on intellectual development but on personal responsibility and the pursuit of power. A child thinks only of itself and immedi ate gratification of its needs. A man, however, considers his role within a society and satisfies his needs through the setting of long term goals. The Aeon of Lucifer is a new aeon, the third aeon in the present cycle of expansion. It builds upon the two previous aeons and shares a common"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 theme with all other aeons of the cu rrent cycle of expansion. The Law of the Aeon, THELEMA, XEPER, DEITUS or Will to Come Into Being as a God incorporates the Words of the two previous aeons with the Word of the current aeon and forms a single statement identifying man’s purpose in this aeon. The Word DEITUS completes an Unholy Trinity: the Will, the expansion of conscio usness, and personal divinity. To understand the Law of the Aeon means to reject any supra-personal deity and recognize oneself as a god. Th is is also the essence of Satanism in all the forms it has taken. The universal subconscious often is called “God”. Since the universal subconscious is the source of nearly all conscious thought, I say with St. Thomas “God is within you,” and with Nietzsche “man is God,” and also with Christos Beest, “man is God and man is Lucifer.” The sad state of most of humanity clearly reveals that the universal subconscious suffers from a variety of neuroses. “God” is certainly a sadomasochist and sexual deviant. Why this is so could be a matter of endless debate but millennia of isolation has cause d the universal subconscious to create endless worlds populated with countless beings which fall upon one another and devour each others flesh. The universe is not static but chan ges over time. During a cycle of restriction, the universal subconscious is more introspective. It withdraws into itself and becomes st agnant. Its thoughts and behaviors become neurotic or even psychotic. During a cycle of expansion, the universe seeks growth and challenge. It influences men to create, explore, discover, learn, and produc e. A cycle of restriction does not, however, undo all of the gain made during a cycle of expansion. The universal subconscious is progressively becoming healthier through each new cycle of expansion. It may seem strange that I say a cycl e of expansion (a Satanic Age) is healthy and a cycle of restriction is unhealthy. One need only compare, however, the world of today with that of Europe in the Middle Ages. In a time when the Church was the center of men’s lives and religion superceded personal freedom, people were being flayed or burnt alive, drowned, or stoned for the mildest of offenses. Today, we value individual freedom and expression of thought and place the needs of individuals before the laws of religion. In this Satanic Age society considers the status of women, the righ ts of children, the plight of the poor, world peace, racial unity, arms reduction, economic free-trade, etc."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 What a far cry it is from burning people to death for spitting on the cross or renouncing God. It has been suggested in the past that there is a universal consciousness. If this is the case, then the relationship between the universal subconscious and the universal consciousness is similar to the relationship between the conscious and subconscious mind within our own psyche. To avoid confusion, I will refer to the universal consciousness as the dynamic consciousness within the universe. I prefer this definition since the word universal implies a commonality. The universal subconscious is universal since it is shared by all humanity. Conscious thought, rather, is not shared between separate individual beings. If the universal subconscious is compared with an ocean, then the dynamic consciousness may be seen as a river. Our subconscious may be linked with the universal subconscious and our consciousness may be a manifestation of the dyna mic consciousness but there is no direct link between one manifestation of the dynamic consciousness and another manifestation of the dynamic consciousness. In the Dynamic Universe , I compare the life of an individual to that of a river and I ask the question, is an individual the water (thought) which fills the river, and which is continually changing, or is it the riverbed (physical body) over which the water flows, which changes more gradually over time and will eventually dry up. This concept is at the center of deitic philosophy and will explain the influence of “spiritual” forces upon man. The question one may ask is, “where do my thoughts come from?” The answer the magi of the past have traditionally given is that an individual’s thoughts come from the influencing geniis and daemons which surround us. An individual of exceptional thought is, therefore, called a genius and an artist is said to receive inspiration from his muse. In the river analogy, the spirits are lakes and tributaries which may serve as a source for many rivers. During a cycle of restriction, the universal subconscious is dominant, and during a cycle of expansion, the dynamic consciousness is dominant. Together, the dynamic consciousness and universal subconscious create a balance between the active and the passive. Many people (passives) are highly influenced by their subconscious minds and therefore by the universal subconscious. They have little will of their own and simply respond to things they see happening. Individual consciousness is, however, a direct manifestation of the dynamic consciousness of the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 universe and a few individuals (actives) are strongly gifted with a greater amount of the dynamic consciousness. Just as a river flows into the ocean, the dynamic consciousness vi olently penetrates the universal subconscious. What is traditionally called magic is simply the application of active upon passive to cause change. In the Dynamic Universe I state that this dynamic consciousness which guides and/or directs the universe is dynamic not static and is, therefore, best described as the Devil, Satan, ra ther than as God. All gods (and devils) are created by man, but God represents the laws and dictates of society while the devil represents th at which threatens the status-quo. Whatever name man may give to these forces, the devil is a more accurate depiction of the dynamic consciousness. Allegorically, the universal subconscious is God, and the dynamic consciousness is Satan. Anton LaVey hesitates to state the exa ct nature of Satan, other than to say that Satan is the force behind revolution and change, but he refers to God as the “balancing factor in nature,” and “unconcerned with human suffering.” Michael Aquino goes a step further in defining Satan (or Set) as an “isolate intelligence within the universe” which bestowed upon mankind the gift of consciousness. Aleister Crowley says “The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs,” and again “I, Hadit, am the complement of Nu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is the name of my House.” The goddess Nuit, described in the first part of the Book of the Law, represents the universal subconscious. The god Hadit, described in the second part of the Book of the Law, represents the dynamic consciousness in a non-active state (Horus) and the god Ra- Hoor-Kuit, described in the third part of the Book of the Law, represents the dynamic consciousness in an active state (Set.) During a cycle of expansion, the dynamic consciousness is active. During a cycle of restriction, the dynamic consciousness is inactive. The universal subconscious remains inactive at all times, being acted upon by the dynamic consciousness. It is the action/inaction of the dynamic consciousness which causes the universal subconscious to change and which is responsible for the expansion/restriction of the universal subconscious. “The Khabs is in th e Khu, not the Kh u in the Khabs,” means that the dynamic consiousness is within the universal subconscious but the universal subconscious is not within the dynamic consciousness. Just as a river flows into the ocean, the dynamic consciousness penetrates the universal subconscious."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 The Word of the Aeon of Horus was THELEMA. This Word refers to the true will of the magician, the will of his higher magical self or his “holy guardian angel.” It is usually true that those people who don’t get what they want really don’t realize what it is they actually want. Every person is being guided by the dictates of his higher self. Those who ignore this magical will, struggle dail y against their inner nature in an attempt to be something they are not or to achieve something that they never really wanted in the first place. This leads to misery on their part and sometimes on the part of others. Crowley says, “Every man and every woman is a star.” This means, essentially, that each person has a unique course set out before him. From the moment of his birth, he must follow the course determined by his magical will. A planet cannot stop in its orbit to question the validity of its path around the sun. It simply follows the path which has been set. “Do what thou will shall be the whole of the Law.” By questioning our actions or the effects that thos e actions have upon others, we cause more hurt than by simply acting upon our will and not worrying about the consequences to others. “Love is the Law, Love under Will.” It is the nature of man to love and to seek union with another. When the will of two beings are joined in love, it is as two stars forming a binary system. By will, love is purified and then there is rapture in the heavens. The Word of the Aeon of Set wa s XEPER. This Word means to “become” or “to come into being.” It refers to the continual expansion of consciousness to new levels of awareness and understanding. XEPER is continuous and extends through all cycles of expansion. The dialectic method of thesis/ antithesis/ synthesis is the process through which XEPER occurs. At any moment, a person manifests the synthesis of all that he has experienced previously in the causal phenomenal world. An individual is, therefore, never the same exact person he was previously nor can he imagine exactly what he will become. The Word RUNA, spoken during the Aeon of Set as an Aeon- enhancing Word, signified the dist ant, unknown, world beyond the horizon of man’s conscious understand ing. With the expansion of one’s consciousness to new limits, the horizon of his understanding changes accordingly. RUNA remains constant since it is always the unknowable and never the known. The Word REMANIFEST, another Aeon- enhancing Word spoken during the Ae on of Set, signified the synthesis"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 of all previous knowledge and experien ce, the final stage of the dialectic method. The expression “XEPER and REMANIFEST” was often used by members of the Temple of Set. From what I have said previously, this should be clear. At any poi nt, an individual (re)manifests the synthesis of all that he has experienced previously. Thus, REMANIFEST is also a constant since it is always the immediate and never what has been or what will be. In the Aeon of Lucife r I make a brief reference to XEM, stating that “XEM can be any destination but realizing that the ultimate goal of man is to become God, XEM becomes DEITUS.” For anyone unfamiliar with Setian philosophy, this statement requires some explanation. The Word XEM was spoken during the Aeon of Set and immediately received great popular support within the Temple as a “Word of the Aeon.” XEM means, essentially, “to be .” Or, in another context, it means “I AM” or “I have become.” While it was meant to be an Aeon- enhancing Word, it actually had the potential to end the Aeon of Set prematurely and even possibly bypass the Aeon of Lucifer to the next Aeon which will follow. There was some dispute within the Temple of Set as to the validity of the Word XEM since “I AM” seemed to contradict the Word of the Aeon, XEPER or “come into being.” Eventually, the Temple of Set dropped its support of the Word XEM. XEPER takes on a greater significance when united with THELEMA. The meaning is no longer simply “to become,” but rather “Will to Become.” Together, it refers to the application of the magical Will to the process of expansion of consciousness. It is through the application of the magical Will that the process of “becoming” may be sped up. A man may say, “I have willed to come into being.” But what, you may ask, is the ultimate aim of this expa nsion of conscious awareness? Is it simply to expand indefinitely withou t end? Is there not a goal or a destiny for which man should strive? Having an objective in mind does not nullify the significance of the journey but, rather, makes it all the more meaningful. And when that goal is attained, there is still RUNA, that which is beyond the limits of understanding... and therefore new goals to be set. The Words THELEMA, XEPER, DEITUS, when taken together, refer to the applicatio n of the magician’s magical Will to the process of expansion of consci ousness with the ultimate aim to REMANIFEST as a God, when the magician can finally say, XEM, DEITUS, or I AM GOD. Then a new Aeon will begin, a new Word will be spoken, and a new Law dictated."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 I have said, “The Word of the Ae on is DEITUS for man has become God, Lucifer has risen, the heavens have been conquered, the Ancient Ones rule once more...” The meaning of this is as follows. Lucifer is a metaphor for man. The rise of Lucife r represents the rise of man to the status of a god. Heaven is an archetypal sphere which man has defined as the abode of the gods. Since man has become a god, the heavens have been conquered. Man is now a resident of the archetypal heavens and the earth will become man’s paradise. The Ancient Ones are an allegory to the ancient primordial power which exists within man. For it was said by the Sumerians, the blood of Kingu, leader of the armies of Chaos, flows within the veins of man, and also, the Ancient Ones (man) will once more rule. All of these st atements are therefore symbolic and refer to the rise of man as a God. The realization of DEITUS is the recognition that man has become a God. There is within man, however, a great dichotomy between light and dark, god and beast. In order to assume our place as “gods upon the earth,” we must recognize the reality that we have already become gods. We must put aside the religi ons and ideologies of the past, and the moralities of the societies of the past, all of which have hindered us from assuming our rightful place as heirs of creation. We must then assume the responsibilities which come with recognition of being gods and begin to act in a manner that reflects the wisdom, enlightenment, beauty, power, and majesty which is within us. It is not required of us that we become “pure” or “blessed,” or that we become “all-loving” and “charitable.” These concepts are Christian corruptions. We must become, like the gods of the ancient world, unique, powerful, and glorious beings... an Apollo, an Artemis, a Zeus, or an Aphrodite. I say that such beings as these cannot be judged for they are governed each by their own laws alone. They set their own values and move in their own spheres. I have said that man has already become a God, but this knowledge is not yet fully realized and will not be fully realized until the end of the Aeon. The Law of the Aeon of Lucifer is “Will to Come into Being as a God.” Once we have fully accepted the reality that we are god and assumed our place as “gods upon th e earth” then we will say XEM, DEITUS."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 Concerning the Rituals he Demonic Bible is written upon parchment made from human flesh in ink made from human blood in a strange alien script, the language of the daemons, dark gods from a time before the creation of man. This dark book co ntains the magic of the Ancient Ones. Many of its rituals involve hu man sacrifice, cannibalism, rape, and torture. The Demonic Bible has been re vealed, at least in part, to those sorcerers and magicians throughout history who have walked the Dark Path. These magicians have translated passages from the Demonic Bible into various languages, often changing certain words in order to hide the true nature of the work. The Grimoire of Abramelin the Mage, the Clavicula Solomonis, the Book of Shadows, and the Necronomicon are among the many books transcribed from the dread pages of the Demonic Bible. The Demonic Bible was shown to the magician John Dee. Dee translated eighteen of the \"demonic\" keys from the strange demonic language in which the Demonic Bibl e is written. When Dee translated his Keys from the Demonic Bible he named them the Enochian Keys. They are not, as is commonly believed, named for the Enoch who \"walked with God\" but rather for Enoch, the son of Cain. Cain was the T"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 first man to perform the rituals of the Demonic Bible and he murdered his brother as a sacrifice to the Ancient Ones. His son, Enoch, was given to the serpent from birth. This demonic language revealed to Dee during his scrying experiments is wri tten in an ancient script which has been passed down for centuries by practitioners of the black arts (many of them unaware of its origins). This script has been called by various names, but is most commonly known today as the \"Theban script\" or the \"witch's alphabet\". The formulas in this book were revealed to me in part by my Unholy Guardian Demon, the spirit Azael, and also in part by Astaroth, Asmodeus, Moloch, and Beelzebub. This book includes many of the formulas given in the Demonic Bible but is not the entire Demonic Bible, the unholy book being thousands of pages in length in its entirety. When originally revealed to me by th e spirit Azael, this work included only the crossing of four gates, corresponding with the four \"Princes of Hell\", and an extraneous book dealing with the invocation of the dead. I performed the rituals and experienced the \"crossing of the gates\" within extremely vivid and symbolic dreams. Since then the spirits have revealed additional rituals to me. This book has been a work in progress. It has evolved over the last sixteen years as I have progressed along the Dark Path. Rituals which enhanced the work have been added while rituals which did not have any noticea ble benefit have been discarded. Having performed the rituals in this book countless times, I have been able to perfect the formula whereby the magician may attain knowledge and power beyond description. Rituals dealing with the invocation of spirits of the dead and resurrection of corpses as well as magical seals, charms, and spells have been omitted from this book in order to avoid such things being used foolishly by those who have no interest in magic beyond the acquisition of wealth and the satisfaction of vain ambitions. If you desire it the spirits will reveal to you all manner of sorceries whereby you may attain that which you desire. This book prov ides the key to crossing the Gates of Hell and becoming one with the Forces of Darkness. Rather than give you spells, charms, and seals for material benefit, this book provides you with the means to acquire these things yourself. Initial to performing these ritu als, you must take a \"Bath of Purification\", a bath in salt water. The reason for this is that salt is a universal purgant. Taking a bath in salt water will eliminate any psychic"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 influence, either \"positive\" or \"negative\". This will remove any curse or blessing and temporarily banish any spir it or demon. Fill your bath with hot water, throw a cup of rock salt or sea salt into the bath, and then enter into the water. You must submerge your entire body in the water to ensure that all psychic influence is eliminated. Once done, you will be in a \"neutral\" starting position from which to begin these rites. It is important that you only do this once, preliminary to performing these rites. If you take another \"Bath of Purification\" later you may have to begin the rituals over again. On the same day that you take a \"B ath of Purification\", you must also wash the sheets and blankets from yo ur bed, wash your clothes, and clean your ritual chamber and sleepi ng chamber. Quitting the bath, you must dry yourself with a clean to wel and put on clean clothes. This initial process of \"Consecration\" is in accordance with all of the ancient grimoires involving ceremonial magic or the invocation of spirits. You must avoid, however, the temptation of becoming fanatical at this point concerning cleanliness. According to the Book of Leviticus, \"if you touch anything that is unclean, sit upon anything that is unclean, or eat anything that is unclean you will become unclean.\" It is not absolute purity which is required but simply a washing off of external vibrations which may negatively influence these rites. The question of whether or not anything is every psychically \"clean\" is an interesting one to consider. The moment you step out of the bath, psychic influences will begin to attach themselves to you. If you are psychically attunes, you may be more aware than usual of these influences. Any \"guardian\" spirits or intelligence's you have acquired through previous rituals may even be outside your bath awaiting your return. You may ask, what then is the point of the \"Bath of Consecration\"? External influences may never be completely neutralized; however, many influences will be eliminated, including those unwanted influences which are prone to hinder the operation of your rituals. The bath also serves as a separation between your old life and new life. As a new born infant emerges from the fluid of the womb to a new life, so will you emerge from th e waters of Leviathan to be reborn in the image of Satan. These rites do not require an altar, sword, dagger, bell, gong, robe, wand, or any other ritual implement. Although not essential to these rites, you may choose to burn candles and incense. If this is done, only black"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 candles should be used. Any \"dark\" or \"evil\" incense may be used in these rituals but I recommend patchouli or sandalwood. You will require a piece of paper, a pen, and a plate on which to place the burning parchment on the night you burn the pact giving your body, mind, and soul to Lucifer. You will also requi re a bowl of water on the night you perform the baptism (this is \"unholy\" water). You will further require a small jar of oil for your anointing on the night you receive your ordination (this is \"unholy\" anointing oil.) You may use any glass or cup as a \"chalice\". You may use any liquid as an \"elixir\" (I have often used coffee rather than liquor since coffee is a stimulant which I found enhances the work more than alcohol.) If you do not have a robe, you may wear any clothing, although you may prefer to at least dress in black. Each ritual builds upon the previous rituals. Each alignment you make requires that previous alignments ha ve been made. Each gate you cross requires that previous gates have been crossed. You must perform these rites in the order they are presented and you must not perform them outside of the context in which they are here given. If you are an experienced sorcerer, you may choose to perform one ritual each night, \"Renunciation & Proclamation\" on the first night, \"Lord's Prayer backwards\" on the second night, \"Pact giving body, mind, & soul\" on the third night, etc. If you are less experienced, you may find it more beneficial to spend an entire lunar month crossing each gate and forming each alignment. If you cannot perform a ritual on a particular night, then continue where you left off on the following night. This is not a simple ritual which is perfor med within a ritual chamber for a determined length of time, but rather a magical operation which will take months, even years, to complete. You may, therefore, choose to begin these rites on a night of special magical significance such as Walpergisnaught (April 30) or Ha lloween (October 31). Or you may simply choose to begin around the full moon or the new moon. The rituals can take any form you choo se. It is not essential to shut out all outside light sources unless you are prone to distraction. You may adapt the rituals to your liking but they must be committed to memory. For this reason, I have left the invocations simple and repetitive. You will have no problem memorizing the invocations and can easily add your own embellishments when you enter the ritual chamber. The following is an example ritual working which a novice practitioner may wish to employ:"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 * Set myself apart to the Dark Lord. * Become celibate, abstain from drugs and alcohol, eat less. * Study the occult every day, perform ritual every night.

This differs from all other systems of magic involving the invocation of spirits. White magicians stand insi de protective pentagrams wearing protective amulets to shield themselves from the forces they call upon. In the Satanic Bible , Anton LaVey mocked the hypocrisy of those who attempted to protect themselves from the forces they called upon for aid. Satanic priests have known that the \"Forces of Darkness\" could be invoked (or \"evoked\") into the sorcer er's body, but rituals of this type have not before been made available to the aspiring wizard because of the inherent danger involved. In other Satanic rituals demons are invoked as external forces (friendly, perhaps, but external to the magician) which may be directed and controlled by the Satanist. Many less-experienced practitioners still fear these forces which they call upon as something alien to themselves and \"evil\". The adept practitioner realizes that these forces are not ex ternal (existing within the objective universe) but internal (existing within the sorcerer's subjective mind). What will become apparent to the practitioner of these rites is that Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviatha n are aspects of the human psyche, archetypes which exist within the subconscious and sub rational mind, not external beings which can in any way influence the magician to good or evil ends. The objective of this sy stem of magic is not to \"invoke\" Satan to physical appearance (for that would be mere hallucination) but rather to become Satan (or to actua lize that aspect of the psyche which is called \"Satan\"); not to \"invoke\" Lu cifer but to become Lucifer; not to \"invoke\" Belial but to become Belial; not to \"invoke\" Leviathan but to become Leviathan. The goal of this magical system is to achieve power, knowledge, and enlightenment by st imulating those parts of the brain which have been called the \"Forces of Darkness\". Scientists realize that the average human being uses less than 10% of his brain. If a grimoire such as the Goetia of Solomon or the Grand Grimoire says that the spirit Dantalian \"will declare the secrets of all Arts and Sciences\" then by stimulating the area of brain called \"Dantalian\" you will understand things previously unknown to you. Just as many animals pass their \"knowledge and experience\" to their offspring through their genetic code, human beings may have the ability"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 to access genetically transmitted knowledge. If a grimoire says that the spirit Seere \"will provide True revelati ons of things stolen or lost\" then by invoking the spirit Seere an area of the brain largely responsible for psychic ability will be stimulated in the sorcerer and he will experience prophetic dreams. If a grimoire says that the spirit Sitri \"enflameth the love of women\" then the invocation of the spirit called Sitri will stimulate an area of the brain re sponsible for personal magnetism and charisma, making the sorcerer more attractive to members of the opposite sex. Rituals from other systems of magic may be incorporated into the Demonic Bible, however, the rituals of the Demonic Bible may not be performed within another system of magic or within a group whose members have not all performed thes e rites and advanced to the same level. The reason for this is that the rituals of the Demonic Bible have a profound psychological impact upon the psyche. Improper use of these rituals can cause \"demonic possession\", \"mental illness\" or abnormal psychological states. Proceed cautiously through these rites taking each step in turn. If you are unsure that you have successfully formed an alignment or crossed a gate then continue to perform the same ritual until you are confident that you are ready to proceed to the following ritual. Do not be alarmed if you have extremely vivid and horrific dreams (or experience lucid dreaming) unless you begin to have recurring nightmares. It is not uncommon to have nightmares when you first begin these rites as your subconscious mind reacts with horror to the \"evil\" it is witnessing. These dreams should be cathartic and act merely to purge the subconscious mind of any inherited guilts and inhibitions. Recurring nightmares, however, are a sign of deeply held fears and anxieties which could, through continued ritual activity, evolve into some form of neurosis. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 Concerning Changes to the Rituals he Demonic Bible presents an independent system of magic which can be easily adapted to function with rituals from other sources. The magician could, for example, extend the Invocation of his Unholy Guardian Demon so that it takes place over a six month period of time beginning immediatel y after Easter as described in the Grimoire of AbraMelin the Mage, or he could replace the rituals for crossing the seven planetary spheres with the rituals described in the Necronomicon. While carrying out these rites he might also perform rituals from the Satanic Bible , the Satanic Rituals , the Crystal Tablet of Set , and other satanic texts, or might simultaneously perform the pathway working of the ONA Septenary System. It is possible that the magician may dedicate a lunar month to formin g each of the alignments described in the Demonic Bible. The magician may adapt the Demonic Bible as he feels is appropriate so that it is harmonious with his past magical workings and comes naturally to him. The rituals of the Demonic Bible are similar to those of the Necronomicon or the Sacred Magic of AbraMelin the Mage in that, unlike a mere book of spells for love, power, wealth, or the destruction of one’s enemies, the Demonic Bible presents a series of ri tuals that the magician can use to T"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 “initiate” himself. All of the ritual s in the Demonic Bible form a single ritual working which the magician may spend a lifetime performing. The goal of the working is to symbolically open the Gates of Hell and become one with the Forces of Darkness. These “dark forces” may or may not have an independent existence apart from man’s belief in them but, whatever they may be, these “forces” exist in an acausal non spatial reality apart from the causal world in which we usually function. This ritual system allows the magician to become a “nexus” or “gate” to these acausal forces. Whether these forces have an independent existence or exist as archetypes within the huma n psyche, the effect is the same. Once the magician has completed many of the rituals described in the Demonic Bible, he may wish to assist another to do the same. Or, the magician may wish to begin the rituals from the beginning working with a partner. In either case, the ritual s will take one of the two following forms. Working with another can be beneficial or it can be detrimental depending on the nature and personality of the individual. It should be stressed that while the formula given he re involves sexual contact it is the energy raised through the sexual ac t rather than the act itself which is integral to the ritual. If either participant is motivated by objectives other than the ritual, the energy raised will be directed elsewhere. Initiatory Style Ritual 1. Dress for ritual and make any preliminary preparations. 2. Enter ritual chamber; shut out all outside light sources. 3. Celebrant lights candle(s). 4.

The rituals of the Demonic Bible ma y be undertaken by a group or coven. If this is the case, each participant chooses a Dark God/Goddess as his personal archetype. The High Priest performs the rituals to Cross the Gates of Hell and become the Devil Incarnate. He then adopts the name of a particular archetype, such as Satan or Lucifer, and is known from then on by that name within the coven. He then initiates the High Priestess so that she becomes the manifestation of the Dark Goddess. She assumes the name of a particular archetype such as Hela, Hecate, or Diana. The other priests and priestesses are then initiated by the High Priest or High Priestess (as appropriate) and become the manifestations of various Devils and Dark Gods. Members of the congregation are then initiated either by a priest, a priestess, the High Priest, the High Priestess, by several members of the group, or by the entire coven depending on the exact nature of the initiatory rite the group adopts. I have stated previously that ritual paraphernalia is not required for the performance of the rituals descri bed in the Demonic Bible.

It should be understood by the practitioner that these names are used as symbolic archetypes for the powers invoked and that the rituals are performed in a particular order which corresponds with other magical systems. The names invoked do not necessarily represent unique beings. A careful study of the names for the Dark Lord will reveal that most are simply titles or designations much as a ruler may be called King, Lord, Emperor, Your Highness, Your Honor, etc. Satan is a title which means literally “adversary”. Lucifer is Latin for “light bearer.” In Hebrew, Belial means “wicked one.” These names, and many of the others, are titles given to the Dark God or Dark Goddess. The original and “true” name for th e devil is that used by the ancient Sumerians. In her original form, the Devil is female. She is the Ancient One, the Serpent of Chaos, Tiamat, mother of the gods and the abominations of chaos. Most of the names for the devil are titles of honor addressed to her. The devil is thought of as masculine in form T"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 because centuries of Christian dogma converted the Dark Goddess/female serpent into a Dark God/masculine dragon. While most of the names for the Devil are simply titles, some are actual names such as Astaroth, Kali, and Lillit h. In studying the names for the Devil you will find that most can be traced to ancient goddesses who represented various aspects of Tiamat , either as goddess of the earth, goddess of fertility and pleasure, or goddess of death. Astaroth is a form of Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of pleasure who descends into the underworld to conquer her sister Er eshkigal, the goddess of death. In this ancient myth, both Ishtar and Er eshkigal are forms of Tiamat. The Dark Goddess was also often depicted carrying a phallic object – a severed penis. The Egyptian god Se t was originally a female deity and was identified with Isis. The go ddess Set carried as a talisman the severed penis of Osiris. Isis and Set, like the Babylonian Ishtar and Ereshkigal, represent life and death and are both aspects of the Dark Goddess of Chaos, Tiamat. It was often said that witches of th e Middle Ages gathered in covens of twelve women and one man, the High Priest, who assumed the form of the Devil and had sexual intercourse with the women. It was also said that his penis was unusually large and that his semen was cold. The truth of the Witches’ Sabbath is that all of the participants were female. The High Priestess wore a large phallus strapped to her waist not to represent herself as the Christian de vil Satan or as the Pagan goat-god Pan but rather as a form of the Da rk Goddess who severs the penis of God, symbolizing both fertility and death. The Dark Goddess, Tiamat, chooses her lovers from among men. It is for this reason that the greatest magi cians and sorcerers of history (as well the prophets of all the major religions) were men. While women are most similar in nature to the Dark Goddess and may have a more natural affinity for magic (and ce rtainly have practiced witchcraft through the ages), it is men chosen as lovers to the Dark Goddess who have been the most powerful magician s of legend. The greatest of these men were worshipped after their deaths as gods. The prophets of every major religion were magicians, practiti oners of the Black Arts, and lovers of the Dark Goddess.

I have said that the Devil is fema le, not male. How then can a man become the Devil Incarnate if the Devil is female? I have also said that the names Satan, Lucifer, Belial, etc. are titles for the Dark Goddess. How can the magician cross the “G ate of Satan” or the “Gate of Lucifer”? I have said that the key to understanding DEITUS is the realization that man is a God and yet the first ritual of the Demonic Bible is a renunciation of all gods. There are many apparent fallacies in the Demonic Bible. I came to realize the fallacies after many years of performing the rituals. I have left the rituals as they are, however, for the benefit of the novice practitioner. Just as a child learns to call a creature “cat” then later learns it is not a “cat” but a “feline”, so will the magician who performs the rituals of the Demonic Bible begin by renouncing all gods; then invoke the names of all the gods; realize that there are no gods; then declare himself a god; and finally re nounce himself. I have left the rituals in the form that I myself performed them. The experienced magician may find some of the rituals trivial for he will have already progressed somewhat along the path through other rituals he has performed.

I later came to believe that there were nine locks (not eight) and that thes e locks corresponded with nine Lords of the Abyss. I declared the Nine Lords of the Abyss to be Paimon, Amaymon, Asmodeus, Belzebub, Asta roth, Oriens, Magot, Moloch, and Dagon. As you may note, I changed the list slightly and adopted the more common spelling for several of the name s. I retained the name Leviatan (instead of Leviathan), as one of th e Four Crown Princes of Hell for a particular reason which relates to the dreams I had when first performing the rituals of the Demonic Bible. I had initially used the name Leviathan in the rituals and was told in a dream, “It is Leviatan, NOT Leviathan!” Without thinking, I had used the name given in the Satanic Bible for the fourth Crown Prince of Hell, the common pronunciation, and had offended the God/Devil who I sought to invoke. Referencing the Grimoire of AbraMelin the Mage (LaVey’s source for the Four Crown Princes of He ll), I realized that it was in fact Leviatan... not Leviathan. I vowed not to make the mistake again and have never refered to Leviatan as Leviathan since that day. Since the first edition of the Demonic Bible was released, I have come to believe that the Invocation of the Eight Sub-Princes has a place in the formula of the book after the opening of the gates corresponding to the Four Crown Princes of Hell and before the rituals to open the Nine Locks of the Abyss. There is perhaps some redundancy in this, since some of the demons are listed as both Sub-Princes of Hell and as Lords of the Abyss, but the Invocation of the Eight Sub-Princes uses the classical names for these demons rather than the common names used today. It seems to me now that there are actually twelve “Gates of Hell” corresponding with the 4 Crown Princes and 8 Sub-Princes of Hell. The first 4 Gates are elemental gates (f ire, air, earth, and water) and the other 8 are angular gates (south, south-east, east, north-east, north,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 north-west, west, and south-west.) The 9 “Locks of the Abyss” may be seen to represent angles above the earth from the southern horizon to the northern horizon at increments of 20 degrees (making 180 degrees from the southern horizon to the nor thern horizon). Multiplying 8 by 9 (to get the number of angles created by the division of the eight cardinal points with the nine angular points) gives a total of 72, the traditional number of “Lords of the Djinn”, powerful spirits of air and fire described in the Goetia of Solomon as bound by Solomon in a brazen vessel but later freed by the Babylonian s. These 72 demonic spirits rule over the angles of the earth, and therefore over all the spirits which dwell upon the earth.

The 72 Lords rule over the 72 divisions of the earth. Invoking these 72 Lords gives the magician power over all the demons which dwell upon the earth but not the demons which dwell in the firmament, in the tartaran abode, or in the abyss of chaos... power over these spirits is gained by entering the underworld, crossing the planetary spheres, and finally descending to the depths of chaos. The descriptions which follow are taken from a very old Grimoire known as the Goetia or Lesser Key of Solomon . These descriptions are provided so that the magician may note the fear with which medieval sorcerers appr oached the invocation of demonic spirits. Surely, a being with the powers described would be able to destroy the magician (despite the grea test precautions on the part of the magician) for having the audacity to invoke him to physical appearance. And surely the magician’s God would abandon him to his fate for having sought wealth, sexual fulfillment, and the destruction of his enemies rather than having faith in God’s will. Ironically, the magician fasts and prays to God for power over the spirits but enters the cabalistic circle of invocation to hi s own ruin... for every demand from the spirit is a statement of greed, lust, envy, or anger. The magic circle, hazel wand, triang le, pentacles, and seals herein described are not necessary to the invocation of these powerful beings. Each of these beings is a Lord who ru les over many legions of inferior spirits. By crossing the Gates of Hell and becoming one with the Forces of Darkness the satanic magician makes himself a friend and an ally to these beings. Without the need for th reat or coercion, they will visit him in peace and assist him in the performance of this work. If the seals are used, they should be written upon the hand or elsewhere upon the magicians flesh as a sign of the magician’s desire to become one with the Forces of Darkness. (1.)

In either case, the ritual will be followed by a consummation of the marriage. To experience sexual union with non-physic al entities you need only lie on your back in your bed with your arms at your side. You should be in a position in which you are completely relaxed and comfortable since you will have to remain in the exact position for several hours without moving. After ten to fifteen minutes without moving you will begin to feel the touch of non-visible hands. You will find that you are able to communicate with the non-physical entities in your mind. As you have intercourse with these beings, you may experience the feeling that you are \"moving\" although your body is still. This is a form of trance and the feeling of \"moving\" out of your body taken to the extreme of astral and physical separation is commonly called Astral Projection. ] Ordination as a Priest of the Dark Lord I have given myself as a sacr ifice upon the altar of Satan.

You will find that these rituals are easily adaptable to your particular situation. Where the male practitioner says, \"I have crossed the Gates of Hell and have become the Devil Incarnate: I am Satan, I am Lucifer, I am Belial, and I am Leviathan,\" the female practitioner will say something similar to: \"I have crossed the Gates of Hell and have become the Goddess of Darkness: I am Astaroth, I am Ishtar, I am Hela.\" The distinction between male and fema le entities need only be made, however, in the symbolic marriage to the \"Forces of Darkness\" and the male practitioner should not fear calling both male and female beings into his body. As a spiritual being, the sorcerer is neither male nor female. Only in the form which his physical body has taken is sex a consideration. Through transmigration of the spirit, the sorcerer may choose incarnation in bodies of vario us races and sex. Many spirits and demons also choose to take male and female forms. For example, Astaroth (a male demon) is also Isht ar (a female demoness, originally the goddess of Babylon). The devil has been personified in art and in literature as an androgenous being, with both the breasts of a woman and the erect penis of a man. To attain union with the \"Forces of Darkness\", the sorcerer will summon both male and female beings into himself. The marriage should be in the form of a male/female union, however, regardless of the practitioner's sexual inclinations since magical marriage follows a natural balance (yin/yang, anima/animus) which exists in the physical world. ]"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 163 Crossing the Planetary Spheres Preliminary Statement I have crossed the Gates of Hell and I have become the Devil Incarnate.

His breath is the stench of dung. HUMWAWA is the Da rk Angel of all that is excreted, and of all that sours. And as all things come to the time when they will decay, so also HUMWAWA is the Lord of the Future of all that goes upon the earth, and any man's future years may be seen by gazing into the very face of this Angel, taki ng care not to breathe the horrid perfume that is the odour of death.

If the “dark gods” or “demons” invoked in these rituals have a literal existence apart from the subjective reality of the magician th en it may be said that these spirits exist in the acausal outside the causal world. Having symbolically crossed the “Gates of Hell” and opened the “l ocks of the Abyss”, the magician may be seen as being influenced, to a certain degree, by what is traditionally called the “demonic”. This influence generally occurs at a subconscious and subrational level and may be experienced mostly in dreams. Crossing the Nine Spheres is a way for the magician to look into the Abyss (look beyond the causal and witness the acausal.) To perform these rituals properly, the invocations must be recited while staring into a mirror. A mirror may be placed on the altar beneath the chalice or on the wall behind the altar. Be warn ed however, that to look into the abyss is to see oneself... this ritual will consume/destroy the deluded.

The first and highest order is Seraphim, the second is Cherubim, the third is Thrones, the fourth is Dominions, the fifth is Virtues, the sixth is Powers, the seventh is Principalities, the eighth is Archangels, and the ninth is Angels. These orders abide in the upper heavens (th e lower heavens being the planetary spheres and fixed constellations.) Within each order exists, both superior and inferior, spirits. The ei ghteen keys are calls to the superior and inferior spirits in the nine angelic orders. The first and second keys call the superior and inferior spirits in the Order of Angels; the third and fourth keys call the superior and inferior spirits in the Order of Archangels; the fifth and sixth keys call the superior and inferior spirits in the Order of Principalities; and so on. By reciting the Keys you will be, in effect, waging war on the heavens and making these spirits subject to your control. This is followed by the Call of the 30 Ayres. The Ayres are spirits which preside over the divisions of the earth and heavens. The Ayres exist beyond all that we comprehend as time and space and have, therefore, the power to change what we believe to be reality. By calling upon the Ayres, the magician may work dir ectly upon the Aeonic Sphere itself. The magician who declares a law or speaks a \"Word\" which changes the current aeon or brings about the creation of a new aeon, becomes a Magus. The First Key Anton LaVey writes: The first Enochian Key represents an initial proclamation from Satan, stating th e inception of the laws of temporal theologies and of the lasting power which resides in those bold enough to recognize earthly beginnings and absolutes.
