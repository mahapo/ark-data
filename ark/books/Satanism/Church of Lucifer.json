[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"   Chris tian Toy s By Rev. Frederick Na gash Throughout the annals of history, Satanism has been a huge controversy, even in today's society. Until now, I vie wed Christians and all weak minded people as toys, put here for the Left Hand Path's amusement. As a member of the Left Hand Path, I believe we are not even of the same species of humanity as a Christian. We have far surpassed Christianity and all other philosophies and theologies in mental capacity and strength. Now back to my toy philosophy. I sometimes watch TV evangelists for a good laugh or watch the news for a chuckle, and throughout all the bad things in the world, these fools still cla im their God will get them through it. The shock of a traumatic experience can sometimes cause temporary delusions, I’ve heard. Christian toys have tried to brainwash the world with their superior right wing rhetoric about how they're God's chosen people, and we are murdering vile creatures who will burn in Hell. I can no longer stand by and let our movement perish by the hands of these weak minded non-individuals. Chris tianity - Orga nized Crime ? By Edebran T.R. What is organized crime? Organized crime is crime with an organized structure behind it. Obviously the most recognized organized crime structure is the Mafia. So why do I say that Christianity is organized crime? What the Christian church does is not necessarily illegal, but should be. What does the Christian church do that should be illegal? Let's start with \"tithe\". According to popular Christian belief it is n ecessary to give \"God\", or the church 10% of your weekly income. Some may say there's nothing wrong with supporting what you believe in with financial support. Perhaps not, to an extent. So why is \"tithe\" wrong, or even stealing? Shall we begin with the countless Christian sermons centered on \"tithing\"? The sermons created with such perfect brainwashing technique. \"If you don't give your tithe, you are stealing from God.\" And what \"God fearing\" Christian would want to steal from \"God\"? \"Your tithe is needed to keep the church going.\" No what you mean to say is \"Your tithe feeds my family.\" What else does the Christian church do that should be considered illegal? Maybe the creating of a mindless person is not recognized as illegal. \"Place your whole heart and life into the hands of God and allow him to lead you.\" What? Give you my last 25 bucks, th en you want me to be led too? The sad thing is many are taught from birth to follow this example. And few of us recover from such programming. On a daily basis I se e Christian drones doing their \"deeds\". Should they all be locked away? No. Many of these people have a brain; it is ju st overwritten with a lifetime of programming. What they need, in my mo st aggravated opinion, is to be de-programmed and allowed to choose their own lives. One final word. I have covered only a minute portion of the faults in a so-called \"perfect\" religion.

Farewell, in chaotic peace, may you continue to challenge the authority that so binds us to a simplified ignorant society. Elitism vs. Common Logic By Rev. Frederick Na gash Elitism is a hot topic among occult groups, with this group claiming to be only for \"the best\" and another group claiming to be \"only for real Satanists or Luciferians\". The COL has, at times, has fallen under the stigma of elitism b y those who were rejected for membership. This article will explain why we do not consider ourselves elite, nor do we run the Church of Lucifer as an elitist organization. This will so und harsh, but, for every ten applications we recieve, one person becomes a member. This is not due to elitism, b ut due to how thorough one fills out his or her application and answers the simple questions we pose in the post-application interview. Before one even considers joining a religious organization of any type, they should at least read the literature. We recieve applications daily from people who seem oblivious to the real occult, yet want to join an occult order. It's kind of like deciding one day, \"Hey, I wa nt to be a Muslim\", but never reading the Quaran. Why do people do such assinine things? A need for acceptance? A belief that religion will ma gickally turn their lives around just by joining and putting forth no effort? It takes little effort to read a couple books and the entire website of the group one wishes to join. However, most believe they can \"get by\". In some groups, this may be the case. We would like all of our members to know, at least, the basic tenets of Luciferianism or Satanism before submitting an application, where half of the answers are either \"I don't know\" or \"none\". Askin g that the applicant know what they are joining is not too much to ask, nor do I think anyone could label us as elitists o r snobs because of it. It is highly suggested that if someone is rejected from the COL to wait three months and read up on at least the basic tenets before requesting another application. If someone is contemplating joining the COL, make sure to read the entire website and to pick up a few books on the subject from authors in the occult movement.

The Great Seal of Ame rica By Rev. Maskim Xu l It's base is the triangular seal of mind, body, and soul with all that it embodies lying within it. In this case it is th e third eye that sees all...just what the American Government tries to do. It tries to see and control all but it can't control all...just see it. As fo r the Latin words, Novus Ordo Seclorum roughly translates to, \"new world order\"; E Plu ribus Unum is, \"from many entities\"; and Annuit Coeptis is roughly, \"declare beginning\". The entire phrase could be construed as, \"Declaring the beginning of a new world order from many others.\" THE MOST HIGH TRIUMVIRATE OF THE L IVING CONTINUUM Amah-Ushumgal-Anna [Ama Usum-Gal An] translates to, \"great mother-dragon of heaven\". This can be referenced to Tiamat, the Babylonian serpent of creation. Habsu is a variation of Apsu, the Sumero-Babylonian fresh water seas beneath the earth. Chthhulhu (aka Kutulu) was a Necronomicon/Lovecraft creation representing the underworld, \"He who lies, Dead but Dreaming\". \"I am, I will, I cre ate\" is the basis of the Living Continuum...the motto of the existence of it, that which sustains itself. The symbol in the center is a commonly known glyph representing infinity, me aning that The Living Continuum is in finite, with no end and no beginning. It was, is, a nd shall be. It is th e Alpha Omega, it's way in itself complete. Trey Azagthoth, the assumed creator of this triangular symbol, described it as this: \"The Living Continuum is th e principal force and form by which all manifestation is possible. It is b oth 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the active willful ability to create as well as the materials to create from.

Frederick Na gash Hmmm, a dead son of a God on a stick, th is would seem to sound a bit abrasive but it is h owever a truth. Christians have twisted the story of Christ around so much there is no one story that has not been manipulated about the Lord of the fools. In reality the Christian Church would not tell you Jesus there so called pure son of God had sex with Mary Magdalene in the original uncut un-manipulated Bible. Hundreds of pages have been torn out of or rewritten in the Bible to make it seem there Bastard son and his father could do no wrong. How could a fully evolved human being believe in all that rubbish that he died for us and for our sins I say thanks but I need no salvation from my sin s. They treat him like a God because he supposedly died for our sins, but if he could save the world why couldn't the fool save himself? If someone in today's society were to claim to be the son of God they would be mocked and called a lunatic so why is it p ossible then and not today? Christianity is a blinded closed minded faith of death and perversion, and I will d efend all of my accusations. First off ask a Christian why he believes in God and Jesus Christ and he will not be able to give you a solid answer he may tell you because the Bible tells them so but the Bible was writte n by man you might as well worship something from a Stephen King novel then. Christianity is clo sed minded to all other philosophies and religions and I have experienced this first h and, Just take a buss and wear a noticeable Baphomet or Inverted Pentagram and watch all the little Christians stair at you like a murdering freak. Christianity is a death worshipping faith as they all live to please a God whom they have no physical proof of to go to some kind of cloud filled wonderland of joy which they have no solid proof of. And finally Christianity is a religion of pure perversion as in the Bible it states man was put on the earth to reproduce and yet the Christian Church would tell you pre-marital sex is wro ng, but I ask why is it wro ng? Suppose you were to marry someone then find out you are not sexually compatible then what? Christians can have there little beliefs if yo u even wish to call them that for they really have nothing to believe in but if they ever chose to bash the Satanist I simp ly ask them why are they a Christian and leave them stumped! Of Ha tred and Hy pocrisy By Fra ter Akuma Most people say that it is wro ng to hate. Everyone is taught to love one another. If you have this mentality, you belong to the herd. In my opinion, it is h ard to love everyone than to curse or hate someone. You cannot force yourself or try hard to love all. If yo u do this, you're suppressing your true feelings and your true nature. I know a lot of people who 'try to fit in' or 'trying to be liked' by doing things for others or pleasing others. They hide their true feelings like hatred, angst, or frustration because someone might caught him/her acting furiously or venting negative emotions that might be a turn-off for most people. Some would rather shut their mouths and be kind to their enemy instead of teaching the other a lesson not to mess with him/her. If you really hate someone, show them your fury. Throw them a curse (magickally, verbally or mentally), so that they'll soon realize that you're not just someone they can pick on. On arguing with someone, there are things to consider. Make sure that you're fighter over an important matter or subject. Fighting about nonsense things is just a waste of energy, and you'll end up like a childish freak. Being true to yourself and following your own instincts is in dividuality. If yo u have doubts about your religion or belief, dare to question. If you're not happy with what you see or with your fellows, or 'brothers', leave that church or group. It is b etter to be alone than hanging out with a bunch of stupid people. Ever since I was a kid, I feel the hypocrisy a nd the self-denial in people when I attend mass on Sundays. I ca n see how stupid people really are when I see a healing crusade on television. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Hatred is part of human nature.

People are Strange By Rev. Frederick Na gash In today's culture there is to much labeling by the appearance of another human being, if someone wears a particular article of clothing or has tattoos ect., it d efines how others perceive them and is enough for most feeble minded humans to say what that person is. In reality I ma y wear all black, have tattoos or piercing, but this does not mean I am stupid or am a particular type of person. In reality, someone can wear the same clothes I do, and even wear the Baphomet and inverted crosses which symbolize Satanism and not be a Satanist. But, because they look a particular way, they would be considered a Satanist in the public eye. If you were to ask me, I would tell you the people that try hard to fit into society and dress in the \"so called\" proper way just to suit another person, is the true weirdo. I encourage everyone I meet to dress how they, and I stress “they” want to dress and not to please the mass media. Psychic Vampire s By Rev. Frederick Na gash I am here to warn you of a different type of vampire. These vampires do not suck blood or sleep in coffins. These vampires drain you of your mental energies by manipulating your thoughts. You may still not understand what a Psych ic Vampire is, but I must warn you. You may even know a Psych ic Vampire without realizing it. The full definition of a Psych ic Vampire is one who uses another to gain something by manipulating you into thinking your there friend. They may buy you nice gifts and small trinkets of so called affection, but they are no friend of yours. They are trying to buy their way into you mind by making you feel sorry for them or having pity or in some circumstances even protect them. You may not know it yet, but you may have a so called friend out there feeding off of you by buying your friendship and making you think your their closest friend. In reality, these Vampires are more devastating than movie Vampires, as these Vampires will d ispose of you once your usefulness is gone, causing emotional scars which this is wh y they are called Psych ic Vampires. They will ma ke you feel depressed, weak and sometimes suicidal. If you discover a Psych ic Vampire in your midst's, treat him or her cruelly and with contempt. Think long and hard, has this person been a true friend to you, or have they been more of a burden as giving you there problems on a silver platter to solve for them. Ask yo urself, who has been there through tough times and fun times and has tried not to burden you with problems or emotional scars which need your healing. Now you may be deep into thought about your true friends. I have realized it is better to have many enemies and few real friends then have a lot of people call you buddy and feeding off of your mental energy. Question everyone and trust no one unless you are certain they are real friends. Tell no one everything you do or know that later, they may try to use it against you. Psych ic Vampires look just like you and me. They come from all walks of life and are everywhere in the world. So, as I said, evaluate your so called friends as the Psych ic Vampire plague is everywhere. Sick Chris tian Soc iety By Fra ter Akuma Christianity's tremendous hold in our society has great effect in the minds of the mediocre masses. Because most people are fed with christian morals and dogma, the non-christian individuals and groups (pagans, atheists, Sa tanists, etc..) are having a hard time dealing with society especially the neophytes. One of the problems that Satanists, atheists, and pagans are facing is discrimin ation. We, of the Left Hand Path had always been judged by narrow-minded people as 'wicked' , 'bad influence' , and other things that alludes to negativity and perversions. Some self-righteous Jesuits and morons warn others and our 'would-be friends' that we belong to Satan and we bring chaos to mankind. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We are condemned and cursed just because we don't believe in god and because we are not christians.

We don't need their attention, praise, nor understanding. Their 'Holy Bible' already burned us in hell. WE ONL Y WANT TOL ERANCE. WE DEMAND RESPECT. The Abyss By Rev. Maskim Xu l To start off with, here is a comparison.. Da'ath: the abyssous sephira, knowledge (QBLH) Nammu: the sea that birthed everything (Sumerian) The Da'ath is the invisible Sephira, the abyss on the Tree of Life. Now, you must ask yourself, what is the abyss? Well, lets look at this from the beginning. You have five elements: energy, earth, air, fire, and water. Everything is either made up of these. Living creatures are most commonly, though not all the time, made up of water, earth, air, and energy; though one could debate that they are made up of all of these, in some form or another. Well, what would the abyss be then? Some see it as a literal part of the ocean, which would make it water. Some say it's a fiery pit, making it earth and fire. Finally, some believe it to be a \"hell\", making it pure energy. For this, we'll go with the \"Hell\" theory. So, if the abyss is p ure energy, that would put it as one with anything else with energy, i.e.. everything. The Sumerians saw the abyss as the Nammu aka Ama-Tu-An-Ki (\"mother who gave birth to heaven and earth\"). Nammu is the primeval source for all things. Acco rding to evolution, everything evolved from oceanic life. Now, somehow the Sumerians knew this...it's too much to hope that the concept of sea being the primeval source is a coincidence. Everything came from this abyss, it is th e birthplace, the source of all things. Have you ever wondered just why our emotions are referenced by the heart? Its an organ that pumps our lifeblood and is essential to our existence...but what made it correspond with emotion? Well, emotion is imp ossible without thought, though thought is possible without emotion. What is though? Well, it's link to wisdom is ve ry strong. Wisdom? \"Sea of wisdom\"? On the Sephiroth, the Da'ath correlates to the heart, when compared physically (Ma lkuth- feet, Yesod- groin, Tiphareth- solar plexus, Kether- head). So, this Da'ath, the heart, the abyss, it a ll connects. Fro m that, it wo uld make sense to see the heart, the organ that pumps our lifeblood, as the link in our soul to it's source.. to our maker. And since this abyss is th e primeval source.. why claim any other maker than the obvious? This is the product of the \"sea\" [and this all goes without mentioning that water comprises an immense percentage of our body's makeup], the Da'ath, the Living Continuum. It is re ceived through our heart, Da'ath, the producer of our very lifeblood \"when you gaze long into the Abyss, th e Abyss also gazes into you..\" -Friedrich Nietzsche Yes, Neitzche, the abyss does gaze back into you.. for when you look into yourself, that is who you see. The Invisible War By Rev. Asta roth de Infernum In general, a war takes place either on the ground, on the water or in the air. Other wars are fought in the deepest part of each human, but there are also wars which are being fought unofficially, not realized by all those who think that a battle can always be seen. What I am talking about is the so-called \"invisible war\" we all are currently fighting. A fight against the 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Christendom and any other hypocritical religion that doesn't take place at a special location but which is fought in other ways, ways that I want to explain to you : Each one of the outstanding dumbasses think that the goal of us Satanists is to collect as many fellows as possible and then march into the final and decisive battle against all their brainwashed puppets ! Last week I got a message from a guy whose name is not worth to be mentioned here, but he really thought that we are willing to gather us somewhere, take our arms and start walking, burning down every church that is on our way and killing every Christian that tries to block our path ! \"What a foolish idiot\" was the first th ing I thought. Well, how can this idiot really think that we are going to fight this way ? This would finally bring us nothing, really nothing. Barbarian times are over and I think no one of us wants that the modern Satanism gets more burdened with prejudices than it already got before. Additionally, we never want to act like the Christian puppets while some puppet players draw the strings securely hidden in the background . . . ! Fact is th at we aren't going to slay for our beliefs while the glare of burning churches lightens our actions. That's all complete nonsense. We have more power than everyone of these lying suckers may imagine and we may reach our goals without any acts of violence ! We don't need to slay indiscrimin ate and justify th ese actions afterwards by telling that we have done this in the name of our God, neither we burn people on the pyres who don't follow our ideology. Time has told that especially this is the wrong way. No, we have other ways to reach our aims. Sa tanism laid on the ground once and still has to fight for being accepted as a real religion and a way of life. All this was made possible by our High Priest Anton Szandor LaVey when he founded the Church of Satan on Walpurgisnacht of the year 1966 and declared year I A. S. . Sin ce that time, Satanism and its influences grew year over year and today, 31 years after this historical day, I see the dawning of a new age for us. People like Anton LaVey, Peter H. Gilmo re, Blanche Barton on the one side and us on the other side are the proof that we will reach our goals sometimes in the near future. When I count all the sites in the Internet that deal with Satanism or have a look at the books who handle this topic, I realize that people stop thinking that Satanism is ju st a game of silly a nd misled kids, but a religion with future. Our political power will grow as well as our reputation and each one among us is wo rking for that aim. You may ask yourself how I draw all this conclusions and take the right to predict all this, but that's really simp le : Satanism is th e only religion where one may live, think and act four himself. Many conclusions I also draw by some numeric syste ms : Ma ny christian hypocrites predict the apocalypse when the century turns into a new era where all misle d people (all those who doesn't follow God) get punished for their sins. This is one of the greatest jokes I've ever heard to. The next century will sta nd under the sign of a new Satanic age and it will b e not our apocalypse, but the beginning of the Christian one. All of those Christians should take care that their own weapons doesn't struck them down, but time will finally tell . . . ! Th e other thing bases on other numbers : All p reparations for the next century will really start with the beginning of 1998 where the number of the beast (3 x 666=1998 ) triples. Also you'll find the reversed 666 in the number of 1999. Although we are working until death for our aims yet, the real Satanic age will sta rt in 2* years and I hope that each fellow has already realized this fact and does the best to ensure all this . . . I want to dedicate the last words of this essay to all those who haven't realized yet that the invisible war has already begun and that we still don't need any weapons ! Beware... The True Trinity of Time By Rev. Maskim Xu l Time has commonly been perceived as cyclin g in Aeons. Many see these as astrologically represented: Age of Pisce s, Age of Aquarius, etc. There are many ways to look at it, all personal to the viewer. This is but one of many views. No te, the dates are very rough, no exact date can be put on a slow process. 7000bc - 1000bc Pre-Judaic 1000bc - 2000ce Judaic 2000ce - ? Post-Judaic Why do I revolve it around Judaism? I do so because in our time, that has been the most prevalent religion, dominating the world. That time is now done. More and more people are breaking away from the constraints of the Judaic pantheon of religions and belief syste ms. Fre e-will is th e ruler of this new age!

Pre-Judaic The organization of life, the beginnings of culture. Various peoples begin forming communities and religion begins. Tools are discovered, cultures developed. Judaic Borne from Semitism, Ju daism dominates the planet. Its offspring, Christianity, begins assimila ting various cultures and forcing people to change and conform to its doctrines and laws. Civiliza tions begin and man develops still, e ven under this growingly vicio us tyrannical hand. Many versions of it are developed, some more vicious than others Post-Judaic People begin moving away from Christianity and fighting back.

The Trus t Factor By Rev. Frederick Na gash \"Question all things that you've been told\" - Rev. Thomas Thorn This is so mething I believe in 100 percent, as it builds an invisible barrier of protection around you. If you trust someone 100 percent, you are setting yourself up to burned so to speak. Such as, if yo u were to entrust someone with all of your Occu lt knowledge and you and that person have a fight, he or she can use your own power against you!!! I truthfully only trust a few close friends and family members which even they had to earn my tru st. Eve n those whom I trust, I do not trust with 100 percent of my being!!! The Truth About Da rkness By Rev. Satrinah Nagash Darkness is so mething that some believe is a facet of the Left Hand Path. For some groups, this may be true. For the Church of Lucifer, it is n ot. Lucifer, the Morning Star, stems from Latin, this is the full definition: LIGHT: L ucifer -fera -ferum [light-bearing , light-bringing]; m. as subst. [the morning star]. Now, being a part of the Left Hand Path, one seeks for knowledge and creating their own personal reality via magick. When studying magick, you study yourself. The end goal is en-LIGHT-e nment. What is so dark about that? Also, I have been told, in passing conversations, that the WILL will sta gnate without darkness. Now, within darkness there is nothing. In this same conversation, I was told to look at a midnight sky a nd experience the darkness. When I looked at the midnight sky, I sa w not darkness, but millions of points of light. Stars.. The Left Hand Path practitioner seeks out these points of light, these tid bits of knowledge, shining bright within the darkness, illuminating it. Knowledge is light, ignorance is darkness. Now, concerning those who are confused. There are many, many occultists out there who are quite knowledgeable. But it tends to be an incomplete knowledge. To know something and applying it, are two completely different things. For example, I know someone who was a member of the Temple of Set. (I mu st note here that this article is in no way of a defamatory nature to the Temple of Set.) He got as far as receiving the Crysta l Tablet, The Book of Coming Forth by Night, Ruby Tablet, the Diabolicon and a few others that I cannot remember at this time . Then, he started analyzing the ideals of the Temple of Set, and its Setian Philosophy. I do know that he once stated to \"higher ups\" within the Temple of Set that Xeper will le ad to the demise of Set. I am not commenting as to whether or not he is right or wrong, and that is not the point of this article anyway. Not long after that, he left the 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Temple of Set. His o ver-analysis of that which is spiritual belief, was his way to find an exit, whether or not he was right. Before that, he had studied LaVeyan/Modern Satanism, and left that as well when he felt that he \"knew\" everything about it. I don't believe he was a member of the Church of Satan, but then again, this article is not about the COS e ither. Then, he joined the Order of Shaitan. Upon hearing the inane ramblings of the now defunct Order of Shaitan's High Priest, he left them and came to the Church of Lucifer. His tu telage in magick, he had learned some of our magickal principles and Luciferian Philosophy. Rev. Frederick Na gash and I explained to him what we are all about. In recent conversation, he has tried to analyze the Luciferian Tradition. No matter how many times he was told, he constantly and consistently clung to the ideals of darkness. In later conversations, he told me that he will not refer to magick as being \"black\" or \"white\". Which is good, that is breaking from the christian ideal. However, he did mention the Lord of Darkness, which would imply \"black magick\". Also, he mentioned the \"Black Flame\" which, I do give credit to the Church of Satan for, since they are the ones who created the term, and use it as the title of there Newsletter/Magazine. And then, he mentions his \"Black Heart\". Now, the heart is an organ that is within one's body to pump blood. If a heart was truly black, one would not be alive. He tends to use these \"darkness\" aspects, but refuses to use the term \"black magick\", which is a total hypocrisy. No w, over the past few weeks, this person has left the COL, stating that we are not Free Thought. Well, he wanted to learn about my personal beliefs, which is Luciferian. He wanted to become as such, and utilize the magick, however, he kept mixin g the stigmas of previous learning, and mixed it with traditional Luciferian belief. It doesn't work that way. That is why it is Tra ditional, there is a way of doing things, that have been that way for many many years. So, in this, he left, but he didn't have to. I would not have treated him any different than before. I will n ot condemn someone for their beliefs, (as long as they don't twist th e truth of what it is, e ither through translation or what have you), for not everything works for everyone. Either way, we wish him well on his journeys. Back to the story... It seems that he just couldn't handle any other ideals than the stupidity that the christians have imposed upon mankind. That is that any other belief other than Christianity is darkness, and that they are the only religion/spiritual belief that is light. Now, you can see how Christianity has brainwashed mankind. There are millions of people who have this belief and cannot be break free from it. Th e Left Hand Path practitioners that fall into this category, no matter how many books they read, no matter how many teacher they have, their belief in darkness will limit th em as a magickian. They will n ever amount to anything magickally, ever. Darkness, by terms of meaning evil, bad, or wicke d, is a christian ideal. Darkness, in reality is ignorance. Light is me rely knowledge and knowing. Shedding \"light\" on the subject is adding knowledge to your brain, as opposed to staying ignorant and in the dark. This is the truth about darkness. What is Reality? By Rev. Frederick Na gash Truly, what is reality? Some may think that I'm crazy for asking this question, other may think I'm philosophical. But anyhow, it is a question which I have asked myself many times. The term reality can be defined in many ways some say it is th e real world others say it is th e true Hell, but in any case no one really knows. Th rough all the thinking and studying I have arrived at the notion that no one will truly know what or where reality is. Fo r instance, what we call reality could simply be another's dream. I have dreamt of other places and they have seemed real enough! Not one single Occult or Christian scientist or philosopher can truthfully tell you what the true reality is o r in that fact where it is. He re is an instance: Once I had a dream that someone very close to me died, I woke up and was actually crying but found that person did not die. In this instance it proves my p oint, if we can dream such horrors and hardships could we not be another's dream? There are other places outside of this plane called Reality such as the Astral plane which one could travel to from this plane, so is it not possible that there are other realities that other people believe to be real, and that they could be right? Wicca the Weak Religion By Rev. Frederick Na gash The philosophy or Religion, as it should be called of Wicca, is just as weak if not weaker then Christianity. They claim to be against religion. But, in the very sense of the word they are just 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"organized Religion With female Gods. Their altruistic Ch ristian attitude is just as idiotic as their Goddesses.

They are accepted in Wicca only because they accept a strong feminine-like posture on life.

I cla ss the Wiccans as low as Christianity because they place their spiritual nonsense above the real world. They have no real concept of what reality is a nd cannot deal with the fear of dying. These Christian Wiccans need to wake up. They're not against religion, they are religion, and it is th em that need to wake up from their spiritualist bullshit. I have spoken with a lot of these Wiccans. I have listened to their nonsense, then tried to explain Satanism to them, but it seems they think they know what Satanism is b etter then a Satanist (They are wrong). They are against Christianity but they believe what the Christians tell them about the Satanist (They are Christianity). I sa y they need to stop condemning the Satanist. We were not the ones who took their heritage and perverted it, and we are not the ones who burned them for being what they are, Christianity is!!!!! So I say, we, as Satanists need to view Wiccans as Christians, not even as an occult theology. You figure both spout Ignorance, both so called “Love everyone”, both believe highly in their spiritualism over the natural being, and both worship Gods and Goddesses! Sounds like the perfect match to me! They both also believe in a Heaven like afterlife, so why not call your self what you are Wiccans, “Christians”? Wiccans are MORE Da ngerous than Chris tians By Deacon Vorphalack I always thought (as most brothers and sisters do) Xtianity is th e most dangerous Religion for the Satanic Community, but I was wrong. It's Wicca!! You may ask why, how could it be that this few weak FemeDoms out there will be more dangerous to us than the big amount of Xtian's telling lies about Satanism? Short answer: They are Fanatics! Long answer: I've talked to many people in my sa tanic life, including Saturn People, Pagans, Celtics, Thelema and many more. They all didn't know what Satanism is, so I explained them and they said: „That's Satanism? I didn't know that, it's not my wa y of Life, but it's Cool!\" And whenever I talked to Xtian People they where scared about me (love that ;) ), a nd after starting to explain what Satanism is in Reality they became great listeners which accept my wa y of life, they still don't like the word „Satanism\" but they accept what I am. But when it comes to talking to Wiccan's I can't explain what Satanism is, th ey knew it better than me, they call me liar, because Satanism ca n't be that way. So I asked: „Why?\" and they said: „We KNOW , we Know everything\". I tried to explain them how my Ma gic works, and they said: „You can't be a Magickian, you don't use a Circle!\", and I said: „I don't need a Circle\". After that they replied: „Your magic doesn't work, We KNOW , we Know everything\". I tried to get them at their assess and asked them: „Yo u said you don't harm anyone (anything), right? But you use the energy of the elements without asking them if they want to give it to you, you harm them in that way, don't you?\" They replied: „ We don't need to ask, they want give us their energy, We KNOW , we Know everything, we don't harm them!\". At least I said: „But you harm me, if you're telling lies about me and my Re ligion!\" „We don't harm you, cause you are the liar, what we say is the truth, the only truth, we KNOW , we Know all about you, we Know everything!\" they answered in their self-righteous, narrow-minded way. And that's the fact that makes them more dangerous then Xtians, you can talk to most people out their with various belief syste ms and they will liste n to you. OK th ere are fanatics in each religion, but in Wicca there are only fanatics, th ey lie to themselves to feel „Good\" and say that all others are wrong. And if all other Religions will b e gone Wiccan's will still sta te that we are child molesters and killers, and if Xtian's will a ccept us as what we are Wiccan's will still sta te that we rape thousands of Women each year, that makes them dangerous, cause most people out there would belief their lies. Even Xtians can change their mind, Wiccan's can't, cause „They KNOW , they Know everything. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Wierdos, Psychos and Nutc ases By Rev. Satrinah Nagash Weirdos, psychos and nutcases. The internet is fille d with them. In the six years I have been on the internet, four of which in some official capacity, I h ave run into many people that fit in this category. These people are classified as the parasitic psi- vamp. Here are a few examples of what I call them. These people claim they have experienced everything from being \"raped by Satan\" to being the \"Dark Evil On e from the Abyss\". In the passing times, I have found more wackos than regular people who do not fit in the social norm. Th ese parasites who like to, and try to play on one's emotions to get something from you. It could be sympathy, pity, frie ndship or attention of some sort. Sympathy Psi-Va mps These particular types have more problems than ten people! It could be anything from having numerous, concurrent health problems to magickal \"attacks\" on them. They try to get help from whomever they can tell these problems to. However, no matter how much you reassure them of our stance, their parasitic wa ys never cease! Pity Psi-Va mps These people are quite similar to the sympathy psi-vamps. The only difference is that the pity psi- vamps are in a constant state of depression. They think everything is so hopeless that they have given up. Then you feel sorry for them. BAM! Psi-va mp at work! Friendship Psi-Va mps This is the type that feels the need to be important. To do this, they surround themselves with people who they feel are \"important\" or are leaders. Here is one example: There is this one person I know, who would only talk to Rev. Nagash or myse lf. This person would never really talk to anyone else, even if they were referred to someone different. This is wh at goes through their mind: \"They like me more that you. I am more important to them than you are.\" Attention Psi-Va mps These are the most common psi-vamps that there are. These will sa y anything to get attention. These things that they say, vary so greatly, that it would take me at least two hours to list them all. However, I will give a few examples. 1. They have \"seen\" or have been \"raped by Satan\" in the dreamworld, then feel it necessary to be a \"Satanist\" or whatever, because they were told to. 2. That the \"devil\" is their \"Holy Father\" and that they must appease him so that they don't incur his anger. 3. That the LHP is th e \"dark\" side, when in reality it is e nlightening, and about learning. 4. That they are controlled by Satan and must do his bidding. 5. Any belief in sacrifice of animals/children etc. to reach their means. (You do not need to kill in order to obtain in magick.) These are only a few traits that define a wacko, psycho or nutcase. Beware who you talk to, befriend and associate with. You will sa ve yourself problems in the long run! YHWH - The Bigge st Sinne r of All By Guyver Cernunnos O.k., su pposedly 'God\" gave humanity certain rules to live by which would assure one's place in Heaven. However, when one compares these rules with YHWH's actions as writte n in the bible, the illusion of a perfect deity shatters like a cheap novelty-store clock! These rules of which I speak are the well known \"7 Deadly Sins\" and \"The 10 Commandments\". Lets compare action to rule and you'll see what I mean. The Seven Deadly Sins PRIDE- It' s said that \"God\" created man in his own image right? So he obviously takes pride in his 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"own self-image; also, if he can look at us and see himself, doesn't that sound like Narcissism? Lastly, many people have said that \"God\" takes pride in his creations (the earth, nature,etc. as stated to me by ministers) Enough said! GLUTTONY- YHW H wants EVERYONE in the world to worship him and forsake all other religions. Now I've always had a theory that deities get a good portion of their power through our worshipping them, loving them, and praising them. Come on! NO ONE n eeds THAT mu ch love and praise! Meaning: Gluttony! SLOTH-Slo th is said to mean laziness right? O.k. th en- \"god\" created the earth in 6 days, then created humanity.....la ter,in biblical times, he created a few mira cles and disasters (such as the 'great flood'), but where is he lately? All of the 'miracles' that have occurred in resent times have been attributed to jesus or the \"virgin\" Mary. The guy's done less than a year's worth of work in how many millennia? \"GET OFF YER ASS YA L AZY BUM!\" GREED- Ag ain I must state that \"God\" wants everyone in the world to worship only him. O.k.,h e wants every possible worshiper he can get his hands on? He wants every church and temple in the world to be dedicated to him and no one else? How greedy can a person get?!? LUST- O.k., I' ll admit that this one is a bit of a stretch. According to myth, \"God\" impregnated the \"virgin\" Mary so that she could give his son life on earth. One thing, SHE W AS MARRIED AT THE TIME, SHE' S AN ADUL TERER! In my min d that's close enough! ENVY- Ag ain I'll have to admit that this one's a stretch. \"God\" had a son to teach humanity how to live and that son turned into such a trouble-making jerk that the Romans did us a favor and condemned him to death. Now priests and ministers say that jesus died for our sins and that we should all try our best to live our lives by the same standards as jesus. Almo st everyone in the x-tian community aspires to be just like the \"son\" of \"God\". YHW H has caused people to envy his \"son\". Guilty as charged! WRATH- An easy one to prove. Remember the \"flood\" that supposedly lasted 40 days and nights? The \"destruction\" of Sodom and Gommorah?(on a side note: if all the morally perverse people were destroyed, how come I -a gay man- am still h ere?!?) Many people in the x-tian community say that \"God\" will punish people for their wicke dness, and who hasn't heard of the \"wrath of 'God'\" In a word: GUILTY!!! So much for the \"7 Deadly Sins\", if you're still not convinced we'll now compare deed to rule in... \"The 10 Commandments\" I:\"Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me\"-What about all those statues of the \"virgin\" Mary? She is the one who has appeared the most often in visions to ordinary people. And then there's his \"son\" jesus who can be found hanging on crosses over the altar of every x-tia n church! Jesus has appeared in certain people's visions as well. If \"God\" wants us to worship only him, then where is he and why hasn't he punished x-tians for loving his \"son\" and the brat's mother more than him?!? II:\"Thou Shalt Not Make Unto Thee Any Graven Image\"- Again I must mention all those statues of jesus and his mom as well as all the paintings and sculptures and pictures Millio ns of people were crosses and stars of David and pendants of Mary Magdalene; how many millio ns or billions of dollars have been made on the sale of these albatrosses? Everyone how has made or purchased these fallacies has yet to be punished!!! III:\"Thou Shalt Not Take The Name Of Thy Lord Thy God In Vain\"- How many people have said \"God damn it!\" or \"Jesus Christ!\" and are still sta nding? YHWH, yer slacking off! IV:\"Remember The Sabbath Day And Keep It Holy\"-I have to agree with Ninazu Xul on this one; if you're truly holy,why would you need a specific day to worship and not worship EVERY d ay? I've yet to see \"God\" punish anyone for missin g church-hell, I misse d church ALOT as a kid and I'm still h ere! V:\"Honour Thy Mother And Father\"-Personally, my d ad abandoned us as a kid and never paid a dime in child-support and my mo ther is a mentally unstable control freak! Why should I honour them? I had to disown my mo m for my sa nity's sake. They caused me nothing but grief! I see no point in honouring that! And what about orphans who never even knew their parents? Why should they honour someone they've never even known? No one's been punished for that one yet either! VI:\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\"-YHWH's personally guilty of this one too. Remember that \"great flood\" that killed everyone that \"God\" didn't like? The destruction of Sodom and Gommorah that occurred because \"God\" didn't approve of their life-styles? And the woman who looked back even after having 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"been told not to and was turned to salt as punishment? All this simp ly proves that YHW H is a cold blooded murderer!!! VII:\"Thou Shalt Not Commit Ad ultery\"- The impregnation of the \"virgin\" mary-A MARRIED W OMAN!!! Guilty again! 'Nough said! VIII:\"Thou Shalt Not Steal\"- O.k., so it's wrong to take items or food and such, right? But it's o.k. for YHWH to steal people away from their native religions and traditions? It's o.k. for his followers to steal the lands, ceremonial places, languages,rights,and even LIVES fro m those who don't worship YHWH? What an asshole!/jerk! IX:\"Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness Against Thy Neighbor\"-What about all those people who falsely accused their neighbors of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials? And what about all those televangelists wh o put most of the money they collect in their own pockets?!? Not to mention all the lies the x-tian church has been spewing for centuries? All this proves once again that x-tianity is a religion based on lies and hypocrisy! An d they're all getting away with it? Where's \"God's\" wrath when it's needed?!? X:\"Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbors House, Nor Thy Neighbors Wife, Nor Anything That Is Thy Neighbors\"- But it's o.k. for YHW H to covet \"Thy Neighbors\" worshiper?(of other religions?) or \"Thy Neighbors\" holy places? or \"Thy Neighbors\" traditions? or \"Thy Neighbors\" language,etc.,etc.,etc. ........YHW H \"covets\" everything and everyone that's not already his! Guilty again!!! As you can see, YHW H has either directly or in-directly broken or allowed to be broken without punishment every Sin and Commandment he gave humanity to fallow. In x-tian thinking, isn't it a crime not only to break any of these laws, but to stand by while they are broken without taking action to prevent the act, or to not punish those who have broken the laws? Modern law punishes swiftly wh en the law is broken- the guilty person(s) are pursued and brought back for punishment as quickly as possible. Then shouldn't YHW H be the same about his laws? He isn't because if he does exist, he knows how guilty and hypocritical he really is! He has broken or allowed to be broken every law he made! This makes him the biggest \"Sinner\" of all time! And people say \"God Damn!\"? Why not say \"Damn God!\", I do. Try it o ut and you'll see how much more appropriate it sounds! The Seven Spheres of Re-Creation By Rev. Frederick Na gash This is the guide through the Seven Spheres of Re-Creation. This in a sense, is a book of becoming yourself on a higher plane than just humanity. Nothing in this world may prevent your will (n o matter how hard they try)!!! Th is book will a ssist yo u in the occult universe as well as in life. The first is th e Sphere of Life. From the day you are born, you perform an act of will. As yo u exit the womb you begin breathing, which is the will to live. Will=Magick. Un fortunately, everyone passes through this sphere. The second is the Sphere of the Satanic Baptismal or Initiation. The Baptismal is a formal ritual, which the one being Baptized, enters the order and accepts his/her Magickal name and number, instead of their earthly one! The one being Baptized now realizes they are above the normal humanity and passes through the sphere. The third is the Sphere of Fate. The sphere in which one realizes they create their own fate and can take control over their own life. When he/she begins to attain their goals through their own workings and own magickal powers, then they may pass through the sphere. The fourth is the Sphere of Knowledge. The sphere in which one studies his occult knowledge at an almost obsessed rate. When he/she has begun performing high magick and even conjurations, then they may pass through the sphere. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"This fifth is the Sphere of Power. The sphere in which one commands his words and demands power within them. In this sphere, one begins to awaken his inner god even further and can obtain almost anything they desire through his/her words. (Eve n a slave to their every word without them realizing it!) Then they may pass through this sphere. The sixth is the Sphere of Joining the Infernal Kingdom. The sphere of the self-sacrifice (Spiritually not physically). Th is is wh ere the you will perform a specific ritual of destruction on yourself!!! Afte r the ritual, if you survive you have passed through this sphere. This sphere is a test of power, to make sure you have fully dedicated yourself to the philosophy and have no reservations. The seventh is the Sphere of the Magus/Universe. The sphere of re-awakening your Inner God, 100%. This sphere is the most difficult to attain. All of the other spheres must first b e crossed. You MUST kn ow even the highest forms of magick. Yo u MUST be able to create and perform rituals flawlessly. Yo u MUST b e a powerful Magickian and have attained most of your Magickal and spiritual goals.

Cracking the Code of the Deity of Slavery By Deacon Maskim Xu l Note: to view this page properly, you must have Schuelers TT Enochian Font.

If so, the Enochian would be reversed, so to make this sound it would have to appear as: • hs * As to how this helps you, that's up to you. for me, this sure would be fun for blasphemic-type rituals and such. Christian Satanists By Rev. Frederick Na gash During the recent influx of budding your Satanists, I h ave seen the Satanic currents twist. I re ceive e- mail daily and am a part of on e-group, to be left unnamed. What I have read from these supposed 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Satanists ma kes me sick. I h ear all about their peace, love, tolerance and respect to all. My sto mach turns. What the hell has happened to Satanism? Thelemites calling themselves Satanists, wicca ns and even the occasional kabbalist. What the hell is that? Christianity seems to have become satanic, as they too, supposedly believe in peace, love, tolerance and respect for all. We are a group of Free Thought Satanists, however, satanist is th e dominant word here. Any satanist of any beliefs are welcomed here. However, they MUST b e a satanist, not an xtian. Peace cannot be, until we are truly free to do our will, wh ere ever we are. Love is given only to the few who deserve it, not to the masses. Tolerance, NO ONE to lerates us, so to tolerate others is to turn the other cheek, which is a xtian ethic. Respect, like love, is only given to the few who deserve it, not the masses. To respect all, is to be xtian, wicca n and thelemite, not satanic. It seems that the hippy revolution of the mid-1900's is risin g again, as the next wave of Satanists. When the hippy fad wears off, we will still b e here, and always be Satanists! I th ought being a Satanist meant embodying Satanic Thought? With the rest of the xtian/hippy satanic movement, it is n o wonder why so many get confused about Satanism. On e site has real satanic thought, and another saying love, peace and happiness. I me an, do these wastrels bother to ever read real Satanic Literature, or do they just like the title? I can call myse lf a Buddhist monk, however, my sa tanic thought would shine through. They can call themselves a Satanist, however, their hippy/xtian foolishness will sh ine through. It is up to every Satanist to read as much as possible, to weed out these frauds for what they are. The true Satanic Movement shall rise as a swarm of locusts, and devour the false Satanists. Hail Satan! Hail Lucifer!

It is so mething that has grown and grown. The 'movement' is so large, that there are a plethora of groups, that one can pick and choose from. And within these groups, some have banded together, while others remain silent. Also, you have to include the groups are magickally active, and those who are not. Unity, a term of alliance. But what most fail to realize, it that unity can be a double-edged sword. There are good and bad things that come with it. From what I have found, those who wish to 'unify' are the same who want satanism to become a household name. This is bastardizing satanism as we know it. This is the direction of the 'movement'. However, it is a pipe dream. There are too many people in high places of government that will not allow this to happen. They would cause nothing but problems. Th ey fear us, for they don't understand us. They never will. It' s as simp le as that! However, we do exist and live our own lives as we see fit. No one can change that in the privacy of your own home. We live our words, rather than merely preach them. There are too many who say 'this' and 'that' on their websites. However, upon other findings, they state, \"We are not really like that!\" That is total hypocrisy. No w, unity, as in the unifying with those of simila r beliefs can be a good thing. For example: Group rituals, exchanging ideas and views, etc... Satanism is a bout ego. It is se lf serving, first a nd foremost. There are groups out there who deem it as the role of a satanist to inform the community of various wrong-doing of the government, or other agency. What we are has nothing to do with politics, n or is a satanist, or any that I know, care about what the government does (Unless it directly affects themself, but other than that...). Th ere are elected officials who do that. Again, we are not the community watchdogs. Magick and Satanism. Th is varies from group to group. Some satanists say that magick does not exist and some say it does. Free Thought Satanism allows the use of any magickal form. On e entity/spirit may work for one person, and not someone else. Every form of magick is u seful, once you erase the control tactics placed on magick. Th ree of the most popular control tactics are: The Three-Fold Law, Do what thou wilt and harm none, and my personal favorite, Love Peace and Tolerance. Now, there are also other things, that can constrain a satanist, and I see these quite often. This is wh y most satanic groups/individuals fail or only have percentage success: • The Leaders of most groups have Magus-itis. (The full definition of Magus-itis is in Condensed Chaos, by Phil Hine. Chapter 3.) • They don't know the basic principles of magick, let alone the universal principles. It is a possibility that some will know most of the principles, but without all of them, and the knowledge to apply them, failure or percentage success will happen. • These groups/individuals take everything from one source. Now, knowledge is everything, and if someone reads only one book and makes the judgement that it is the best magick ever, they will falter. After all, not all books on the subject of magick are completely true, nor will they contain everything you need to know. These individuals also fall under the Magus-itis category. • The use of only one doctrine and following that to the letter, a.k.a. HERD MENTALITY. The satanic movement has changed. There are those who identify with satanism, and there are those who live it. If yo u are someone looking to join a group setting, be sure to realize this. Realize who you are yourself, after all, satanism is a bout the self. Remember, those who merely identify, will p ortray themselves as being. Choose wisely your associations, and be intelligent....BEW ARE o f HERD MENTAL ITY...it is e verywhere, in every circle . 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Why I am Not A Christian...

Frederick Na gash By definition Luciferianism co uld be construed as the worship of the deity or arch-type of the energy named Lucifer. Luciferianism is o ften misrepresented in the public view and often mistaken for Satanism even though true Luciferians will te ll you Lucifer is separate from Satan. Luciferianism and Satanism sh are some very simila r views and attitudes but are separate entities unto themselves. There are two aspects to Luciferianism one being Deistic and the other being anti-Deistic both being acceptable as Luciferian aspects. Within the different sects of Luciferianism there are underlying principals which both adhere to, based on principals of the four kings of Hell. Living a life based on the principals of the four kings we achieve self-deification. First I' ll start with the Lucifer principle than continue on to the others. The Lucifer Princ iple By Rev. Frederick Na gash Lucifer's number is nine, nine being the number of pride as any number nine is multiplied into returns to itself. (Exa mple: 9x5=45 - 4+5=9) Lucifer also being known as the \"Angel of pride\". This represents being proud of all things we do! Lucifer's color is blue, blue being the color of the sky and water representing that Lucifer is all around and within us. That Lucifer is the prime element/energy that motivates and cultivates our world. Other colors Lucifer is associated with are white and silver, so accordingly altar pentagrams mu st be surrounded by blue with a silver/white pentagram with a black border (Shown on page ). Lucifer's element is air, air being that which allows us to speak his words of truth as his manifestation on Earth. Lucifer's direction is the east, east being where a lot of the sacred wisdom and the great wars will come from. It wa s once stated to me by a Germanic Luciferian that \"a wise Magickian from Persia an Arab will co me and bring with him the aeon of Lucifer\" or in lay-mans terms the Antichrist. Lucifer's human element is wisd om or applied knowledge, with time, study and practice it is believed that man can attain the Lucifer state, this only through applied knowledge or wisdom. Lucifer's altar element is incense, incense being a representation of air, known to Luciferians as \"sweet air\". Lucifer's planetary element is Venus, Lucifer being known as the morning star or first sta r of morning, otherwise known as Venus. Venus, known as the \"Planet of love\" represents the beauty of Lux Ferre (Latin for light bearer/bringer or Lucifer). Lucifer's consort/Female aspect is Lilith, Lilith being the first wife of Adam before becoming the queen of the damned. It is sa id Lilith comes from the mud and the dust and is queen of the Succubi/Luciferic Witch. When Lucifer and Lilith mate they equal the androgynous being known as \"Baphomet\" or the \"Goat of Mendes\" also called \"God of the Witches\". Liliths number is two , also known as the number of the eternal female. Lilith is considered an equal to Lucifer to some, and the feminine aspect of Lucifer himself to others. Lucifer's highest manifestation is through understanding of oneself, this being the goal of the Magickian/Luciferian to begin with, being as Lucifer himself, total awakening of the human god-form Lucifer. Without knowing the self one cannot hope to achieve any real understanding of anything else. Applied knowledge in action is a prime example of Lucifer's manifestation! The Satan Princ iple By Rev. Frederick Na gash 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Satan's number is six, six b eing the number of \"the beast\" representing mans carnal nature being set free. Releasing the wolf within if you want to call it so. Sin no longer exists, n othing is sinful but to deny yourself of pleasure in your Utopia. Satan's color is red, red being the color of emotion, Satan being the guardian of lust, anger, happiness, sadness etc...being released. Satan's element is fire , fire being an appropriate representation of emotional outburst or ritual. Destruction and lust are the two prime elements of fire and Satan. Satan's direction is south, south representing the dissension from God-hood to the ascension to God- hood. Creation of ones Utopia. Satan's human element is anger, lust and primal emotion, representing the release of emotion through sex or anger and crushing of ones enemies. Satan's altar element are the candles, Candles representing holding the flame of Satan or emotion, primal man. Satan's planetary aspect is Ma rs, Mars being the planet that represents justice. Due to the biblical story of Satan punishing the sinners Satan was at times called the \"Avenging Angel\" or \"Angel of Justice\". Satan's highest manifestation is through (wo)mans full release of the carnal will, se lf explanatory. The Leviathan Princ iple By Rev. Frederick Na gash Leviathan's number is three, three being the number of Chaos as three can go into six and nine but doesn't have the stability of the number one. Leviathan's color is blue, blue being the color of the wild oceans untamed, (wo)mans carnal side overcoming him/her, chaos. Leviathan's element is water, water being that which our human forms are primarily cre ated of. This represent the unity of matter and anti-matter, chaos and order, yin with yang. Leviathan's direction is west, west being used to represent chaos and disorder. Leviathan's human element is chaos, chaos meaning manifestation of order from the chaos of the nothing. No longer controlling ones actions, words etc... and not remembering fragments of time due to anger or lust are prime examples of this principal. Leviathan's altar element is water, used in the chalice as a sacrament to or as Leviathan. Leviathan's planet is ma n or micro cosm, representing the bond between man and his own lost natural self. Leviathan's highest manifestation comes from man realizing his own deification, Just as God can create and destroy so can we. Just as water is unpredictable and can be calm one moment and crashing another so are we. That's the gift of/from Leviathan! The Belial Princ iple By Rev. Frederick Na gash Belial's number is one, one being the number that represents earth and remaining firm to ones convictions. Bullheadedness in a good way! Belial's color is black, black being the color of the primordial chaos before the Earth. Most Luciferic sigils have black in them in some form representing the Earth. 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Belial's element is Earth, Earth being the element that sustains humanity. The carnal laws of man are dictated by the laws of the Earth. Belial's direction is north, north being the representation of constantly strivin g forward and upward changing and recreating our Utopia bigger and better. Belial's human element is remaining firm to ones own beliefs, not dancing around in pools of religious feces. Finding a philosophy which is your own and stickin g to it. Belial's altar element is the incense coal, representing Earth and (Wo)mankind holding the flame of Lucifer. Belial's planet is Earth, previously explained. Belial's highest manifestation is through understanding and living the natural laws of our carnal self, self explanatory. Introduc tion, c ontinue d. By Rev. Frederick Na gash To the Luciferian nothing comes before the self and its development and progress into the new or \"manifested self\". We constantly strive to improve our-self and our \"Utopia\" to live the only life we'll have to the fullest and spit on those who do little yet expect big things to happen. We eliminate all whom are parasites from our utopia, deeming them dead and forgetting their existence. Luciferians are by nature very solitary even when within a group such as the Church of Lucifer. Group activity primarily consists of lectures on traditional Luciferian magick and religion as well as the occasional ceremonial ritual held on holidays. It is b ecause of our solitary nature and individuality that we do not expect every Luciferian to \"Love thy brother\" as the Christians, Wiccans and even some Luciferic and Satanic groups do. Even a few Luciferians are real \"A$$-Holes\" who even I can't stand, let alone love like a brother. I'll leave the \"sacred brotherhoods\" to the Christians, Masons, Wiccans etc... In my Utopia very few and select are worthy of love, more are worthy of my hate, I find brotherhoods in the L.H.P a ridiculous notion based on a need for acceptance and a \"Thrill or adventure\". Luciferian philosophy is very anti-outsiders, select family and friends are all whom make up each individual Luciferian family. Frie nds often being more like a member of the family ra ther than an acquaintance or someone of use. Everything in your Utopia is a manifestation of your own will, fo r good or bad. If you let someone use or take advantage of you, don't complain about it later, eliminate them like the parasite they are. Tell them you no longer will le t them feed off of you and you don't want them around you any longer, erase them from your existence. If you want more money get a better job, or higher education to be paid more, the weight of your own existence is in your hands. This total responsibility of the creation and maintenance of your Utopia is what frightens off most people, we're not most people! Luciferians come from all walks of life, from blue to white collar workers strivin g to make their own lives more fruitful and pleasant and who don't mind stepping on toes to get there. We do not believe in apathy, self-destructive behaviors, loving everyone, killing (Physically) in the name of the COL, Satan, Lucifer or something else self-delusional. We are after all simply, Social Realists and Utopians. \"Manifested self - The self once all Luciferian principals are adhered to, the manifestation of a/the spirit through the self or a higher self\" \"Utopia - everything that is around you that has some form of impact on you or your life. We create our Utopia by keeping the select few around us who are worthy of our love, getting your ideal job and or accomplishment or recognition of ones natural skills. Simp ly living the life we most desire and dream about\" Luciferianism: Re ligion of Libe ration By Rev. Frederick Na gash 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The term religion, is well misunderstood by most. Religion is simp ly philosophy in practice, in everyday life. Religion is often also known as being spiritual. Luciferians are spiritual, even if they don't believe in a manifested spirit. Spiritualism co mes from the Self-Realization and responsible action, as all things in your universe are a manifestation of the will. Luciferians are responsible Social Realists, which shows a root within a spiritual compound. Morality and spirituality are what Luciferianism is a nd was founded on. Morals will va ry from person to person. However, whatever fulfills one spiritually or internally, is in deed a work of their morals. Liberation is the cornerstone of Luciferianism. Liberation of the entire self. Liberation of the spirit, will a nd mind, total freedom of the self in purest form of Luciferic expression. While all other religions deny liberation, we are the embodiment of it. Re sponsibility mu st also be stressed when speaking of liberation. Responsibility is le arned once one realizes all things, bad or good, that happens in one's life is his own doing. There is no retarded \"three-fold law\" or \"leash\" to chain us down like dogs. However, if one needs money, get a job. If one is unhappy at work, change jobs to something more pleasing. Never blame others for problems in your life. The acknowledgment of the ego in magick is re ally the only difference between supposed \"black Luciferic\" magick and white magick. In reality, wh en a white Magickian heals someone, they feel good inside, hence, why they do it. Eve n if white magickians deny it, they also use magick with ego. Magick is just magick. To label it \"black\" or \"white\" is folly. Ma gickal Law, much like human nature, is universal. Luciferianism focuses on Self-Realization, Self-Deification and Self-Cultivation, and is by nature, solitary. Though Luciferianism is so litary, group practice is encouraged, so one can meet others in the same religion and learn from one another. Lucifer, being a bringer of wisdom, would best be represented through others who have a constant thirst for knowledge. A burning passion for life is what drives us toward our studies and magickal perfection. Through solitary practice, I've learned more about myse lf and am able to see myself for the first time . Through group practice, I've learned much more about religion and all forms of magick. Being a Luciferian is much, much more than a title or a label. It is to wards the totality of all forms of liberation. It is th e intentional act of Self-Accu sation and final perfection. There is a life long dedication to the self and to wisdom for one to be called a Luciferian. False emotion and martyrdom must be eradicated, as well as false egotism fo r one to be called a Luciferian. Finally, the term Luciferian can never be given to one with the following attributes: Someone who speaks with out action. Someone who blames others for their own faults. Someone who has no thirst of life or knowledge. Someone who cares little about them self. Someone who is afraid or hesitant of total liberation. Someone who thinks Luciferianism is th eir way or no way. Luciferianism and Luciferic Thought should never be systematized or standardized to the point of alienation of individual thought. Someone who thinks that they're \"evil\". Evil a nd Good are creations of Christianity, not of individual thought. Someone who feels as though they need to talk, act or dress a certain way. Someone who feels the world treats them so horribly so in turn they adapt the I don't care about anything attitude \"Apathy\". The Luciferic Hurric ane By Rev. Frederick Na gash In the new mille nnium, our country will h ave witnessed the undoing of organized religion as the world floods, burns, and rapidly depletes into a more original primal state and Christianity falls as people realize they cannot be saved. The world has already witnessed many of these things over the past few years and they will co ntinue to worsen and grow more fierce as time passes. You may ask why I bring 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"this to your attention? The answer is simp le, as the world drifts into there more survivalist state they will realize there is no caring, forgiving God guiding them and those that still do cling to the cross are fools! A wa r is currently being fought and has been fought for centuries now, the war is going on around the world, it has many faces and many names, my fa vorite is urban blithe. As our world moves more towards an industrial environment and as the o-zone depletes more rapidly by the day the storms and floods will co ntinue to get worse. As our world moves more towards a home like city atmosphere the crime rate will rise to an all time high, this is wh at I call the \"The Great Luciferic Hurricane\". Why you may ask? Once again the answer is simp le and right in front of your face, the very essence of Luciferianism the foundation of it is b ased around survival of the fittest. This is wh ere Luciferic ethics will re ign and the so-called \"Good Christian Ethics\" will prove useless. Christianity is only in place to protect those to weak to protect themselves, with there love all attitude and \"forgiveness is divine\" crap that has no place in our worlds future, yet many will d isagree and call it the \"Judgment day of God\" in reality it is a \"Great Luciferic Hurricane\" taking place where your very life may depend on Luciferic ethics, not the weak Christian teachings. Heed these words for as the time grows nearer to the due date you will need to look back and realize what was right all along, and what was force fed into your minds by your parents and the Jew/Christian controlled mass media on the old boob tube. Some may say I'm a bit paranoid and they are correct but if you look at the news paper or watch the news you will se e everything I have told you is coming true right before your very eyes, this sounds a bit more like concerned then paranoid if you ask me! The fall of Christianity is obvious and the rise of a new Luciferic age is upon us, stand forth and speak your mind for now is the time to prepare for the silent war!!!!! $alvation for $ ale By Rev. Frederick Na gash Yes you to can be saved for a small donation to your local Christian Church, or this is wh at the hypocritical Christian Priests will se ll you. There are T.V evangelists everywhere you look now a days talking about how your soul can be saved and how they can heal your illnesses and all they ask for is a donation to the Church. In reality they have no real power and it has all been a ploy to make those weak minded enough, to give up their hard earned money to that particular Church or organization. I have witnessed this first h and, for starters there are Benny Hinn, Oral Roberts, R.W Schambach and countless others that will se ll you your salvation through your television set and claim the money you send will only go to help there Church. Have you ever seen a T.V evangelist with a shabby home? I ask why if mo ney is the root of all evil do they so long for this evil, even beg for it? They claim they are a Church so that they are tax exempt and can keep all the money they take from weak minded Christians, yet if the Church of Lucifer were to try to become tax exempt it would be laughed at, I say why, we are a Church? Tax them all than!!! Actually the answer is simp le, Christians keep to Christians and only do for Christians it is re ligious discrimin ation but the government will ca ll it something different or claim we are a cult not a Church because the government is a cesspool of one huge Christian pile of dung. No thinking, rational, intelligent human being would buy there salvation so to speak, also no rational human would believe in the garbage preached by these self-righteous idiots! But than again, most Christians believe in a big old man in the sky pulling every ones strings and having \"magickal sex\" with virgins where God actually has a \"magickal child\" who can walk on water and who died to absolve every ones sins! Sounds like a story I wo uld have made up as a child and not something I would expect grown adults to adhere and believe in. Four Sphe res of the Elements By Rev. Maskim Xu l This is so mewhat of an elemental balancing. It requires a good deal of visualization and is meant to be more of a psychological effect; to give a feeling of balance. You must visualize each element as a sphere of itself and take it within. You can say aloud the writings below concerning the spheres or you may just visualize them. Whichever works best should be done. The Earth Sphere is to the North and is ruled by Ki. Ara Ki! The Air Sp here is to the East and is ruled by Enlil. Ara Enlil! 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Fire Sphere is to the South and is ruled by Gibil. Ara Gibil! The Water Sphere is to the West and is ruled by Nammu. Ara Nammu! There is and could be no sphere or control of Energy, which is Chaos. It is wh at the Spheres of the Elements revolve around and it permeates them all. You must feel the base of all things permeate yourself and everything around you. When you feel at one, take a deep breath and you are done. Magick By Rev. Frederick Na gash Magick cannot be condensed into merely one volume of work, it has a broader perspective than that. Yet, I will ke ep this essay short, just to give the initiate somewhat of an idea of our workings. Our magick has a deep base in Draconian/Astral workings. Initiates of our Order will fin d the basics of our magick mo re difficult than some of our high magick due to a singular point: The beginning of any ones magickal journey is a rocky one, to say the least. The initiate must be able to control his/her mind and body completely before he/she can move any further. To properly perform any type of magick, the initiate must have strong mental focus, devoid of any distractions or emotions but the desired effect. For magick to be worked properly, the initiate must not have mental problems, or the end result could be horrifying and damaging to both the initiate and the Order. \"Black Magick\", as it is co ined, has the sole purpose of self gratification, as opposed to \"White Magick\", which is used in the gratification of others. The Magick of the \"Left hand path\" is a form of Black Magick and \"Torelian Magick\" is a form of the Left Hand Path. Torelian magick is n ot the only spectrum of the occult universe we study, but it is o ur primary focal point. \"Torelia\" is a plane of travel I found during astral projection. It is mu ltifaceted in it's use. I have performed conjurations with 100 percent clarity, wh ich is something I had been struggling with for some time. I have awakened my inner god, and I have spoken with the spirits of the dead (Necromancy). The occult's uses are in tact for the primary use to seek vast knowledge, or just knowledge of one's self. It is a vast universe filled with many obstacles along the way. After these hurdles, so to speak, are jumped, the world is yours to explore. And what a fascinating place it could be!!! The Altar By Rev. Frederick Na gash In this text, you will fin d the basics of setting up a proper altar and what the specific ite ms on the altar represent. You can also customize your altar to specify your particular deity's) or philosophy, as well as adding a personal touch. Find things which represent you and incorporate them to your altar as well. Candles-Candles are used to represent the element of fire, and if the proper colors are used, can also represent the four elements of nature as a whole: • White - Air/Purity • Red - Fire/Carnal Emotion • Black - Earth/Solidness • Blue - Water/Inner God Incense-This one is up to you or your tradition. Some use scents for specific needs or rituals. Incense represent the element of air. The Altar Bell-The bell is used to show power at the end of a quote. It is u sed to generate the Magickal Atmosphere Dagger or Wand-The wand is used when ever the dagger cannot be, such as in public rituals. Both are used to cast your energies out to a specific point and to dispel forceful or angered spirits. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Salt-Salt is used only to represent the element of earth. Water-This ones self explanatory of what it represents The Chalice-Filled with wine or another pleasing beverage (Non-Carbonated) is used as a sacrament. Sigil or Symb ol-Specific symb ols are used in certain rituals to represent the goals of the ritual taking place. Your main sigil above your altar should represent you, your religion or philosophy, and should be something you identify with (Pentagram, Hexagram, Quadragram etc..) Sulfur-The sent which when burnt is pleasing to most spirits and deities, and should be sprinkled on top of ritual offerings Bowl-Use d to place offerings, divination and to burn sulfur. What is Demonology ? By Rev. Satrinah Nagash Demonology is the study of demons. This entails many aspects, in which research is essential. The more resources one has, the more you can learn. However, reading books is not the only way to learn. When using book references about demons, you must remember that the attributes of the demon, can and will va ry. Each author had different experiences with them, and notated these experiences. Each demon does many things, not just one thing in particular. When researching various demons, there are a few books that imme diately come to mind with most people are \"The Keys of Solomon the King\" and \"The Goetia: The Lesser Keys of Solomon the King\". These can be good references, but they are not the only ones. Remember, there are many religions out there that have their own pantheons. A lot of people tend to ignore these other groups because they are still blinded by the xtian ethic of what a demon is. Demonology is the study of demons; that means all demons, no matter where they come from. To further one's study of demons, and their nature, is to work with them. Gra nted, various texts give detailed information about these demons, but the only way to truly know is to work with them yourself. Demons have been around longer than xtianity. The Sumerians even had demons and they predate xtianity by at least 4000 years. The Basic Theories of Magick With Re v.

How to Make a Bowl for Flame Tasks By o.n.m -i.s.i.s.i.o - Saskatulsaa 47 t 0 Personally, I prefer to use clay since I am an earth symbol. But, metal can work (ouch hot!), wood (flammable), glass (hot once again), so like I said clay will wo rk. I ma de mine from hand and kilned it myself on a outing into the forests. Yo u can inscribe sigils and what have you on it. These all will a dd up to the desired effect so make sure you inscribe good ones. Procure some parchment paper, its expensive yes, but it burns good. Procure a candle, preferably black or whatever color if your personal favorite. Get some cool incense you just love or really repulses you. Now, take some of the parchment and burn it, like 3 pieces is good. Just put all the ashes in the bowl and crumble them up. You may want to write sigils on there. Now, this is the part that you have to do right. Have a half piece of paper ready in your hand, and the candle and start to really pour the wax into the ashes, remember try and keep the wax there hot don't let it solidify.

Chaos Magick by Rev. Satrinah Nagash To have success in chaos magick, it is a ll dependant on your degree of mastery of the magickal trances and metamorphosis. Initiate chaos magick includes three ways, ritu al, sigils and dreaming. Ritual - This is a combination of the use of talismanic weapons(magickal weapon, dagger, wand, etc.), gesture, visualized sigils, word spells and magickal trance. One thing that is essential for beginners in chaos magick is to have an effective banishing ritual. A good banishing ritual will prepare you for magick concentration more rapidly than any of the magickal trances alone, however, you do need to utilize or know the technique of magickal trance before doing banishing rituals. The reason for this is that, if your mind doesnt know what to do when requested, at a more rapid pace, you will not reach the magickal trance. This also enables the magickian to resist obsession if problems are encountered during dreaming or sigils becoming conscious. It also protects you from hostile occult influences that may be present. To develop the Banishing Ritual, you will need a magickal weapon. To do the ritual, these are the suggessted requirements. First, d escribe a barrier about yourself with the magickal weapon (gesture). Also, strongly visualize this barrier, three dimensional barriers are preferred, however it is yo ur preference alone on how you describe it. Next, you focus your will on a visualized image, for example, the magickal weapon, or third eye, or a ball of light inside your head, etc. A so und concentration can be used additional, or alternatively. Third, the barrier is reinforced with the magickal weapon. This could be a 5 pointed star or pentagram, or the eight pointed star of chaos, or any form, also, you can use words of power as well. And finally, you stop thinking, to enter the magickal trance. That is a simple yet effective Banishing ritual. Sigils - Th ere are three parts to operating a sigil. The sigil is constructed, the sigil is lost to the mind, the sigil is charged. In constructing a sigil, the idea is to produce a glyph of desire, stylize d so it doesnt immediatly suggest the desire. It is n ot neccessary to use complex syste ms here. One way by word method, write down a sentence, and delete all repeated letters. Rearrange letters so that they are connected in a picture, to give a pictoral sigil. Pictu re method, draw your desire the best you can, but simple. (no coloring, no shading, just lines) and then you can straighten out the lines making geometric shapes from the original picture, so that you cannot tell what the desire originally was. This will then lose it to the mind if you let it. To successfully do this, you need to banish it from waking consciousness. Sometimes the sigil can be burnt, buried, or cast into the sea. The sigil is charged at the moments when the mind is has achieve pure concentration through magickal trance, or when high emotionality paralyzes its normal function. Then concentration on the sigil in the mind as long as possible, it is wise to banish it by evoking laughter. To move on in Chaos Magick, one needs to have some sort of mastery in the Magickal Trances. This section will co ver ritual, sigils and dreaming. Also, it is n ecessary to make yourself familiar with at least one system of divination, however the system you choose should not involve too much randomness. (Astrology is NOT re commended) Whatever symb olic syste m or tools you use, they are merely tools to amplify or act as a receptacle for your inner ability. Th us, one person may choose the Thoth Tarot Deck, and another chooses the Rider-Waite Deck. Each person is doing the exact same thing with these deck, however the symbolism ma y be different, the card are performing the same act for each respective magickian, within that magickians' symbolic syste ms. Ritual is a combination of the use of talismanic weapons (daggers, wands), gesture, visualized sigils, word spells and magickal trance. Before moving to sigils and dreaming, you must have an effect Banishing Ritual. The Banishing Ritual has the following effects: It p repares you for magickal concentration faster than any trance exercise you may do, and it also enables one to resist obsession if problems with various experiences occur and it protects you from any hostile occult influences that may occur. A ma jor part is the magickal weapon. It should be something that is imp ressive to the mind, and also represent one's aspirations. It is a major advantage to make your own magickal 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"weapon, or find one in some odd or strange way. To develop a banishing ritual, you need a magickal weapon. You need to describe the barrier around you and visualize it within your mind. You can add sound concentration at this time as well. Finally, the barrier is reinforced with symbols of power. Words of power may also be used. Then the magickian voids, by stopping thought. Sigils Sometimes, you need something that cannot be gotten through normal channels. It is so metimes possible to bring about the required coincidence by the direct intervention of the will provided that this does not put too great a strain on the universe. The mere act of wanting is rarely effective as the will becomes involved in a dialogue with the mind; therefore magickal ability becomes diluted. What happens then, the desire becomes part of the ego complex and then becomes anxious of failure. The will not to fulfill desire arises to reduce fear of failure. Then, the original desire is a mass of conflicting ideas. Ofte n the wished for result only happens when the desire is forgotten. This is wh at makes sigils and most forms of magick work. Sigils work because they stimu late the will to work subconsciously, bypassing the mind. Magickal Trance helps in bypassing the mind. In using sigils, there are three parts. 1. The sigil is constructed, 2. The sigil is lost to the mind and 3. The sigil is charged. When you construct a sigil for use in chaos magick, you are producing a sigil of your desire, but stylize d to not imme diately suggest the desire. Complex symb ol systems are not necessary. Words, images or sounds can construct these sigils. The subject matter of the spells is arbitrary and not recommended. To successfully lose the sigil, both the sigil and the associated desire must be banished from waking consciousness. On e way to achieve this is by forceful turning of attention to other matters. The sigil sometimes may be burnt, buried or cast into the ocean. Word spells can be lost by constant repetition. This eventually empties the mind of the associated desire. The sigil becomes charged when the mind has reached the peak of magickal trance, or during high emotionality paralyzes its normal functioning. This is wh en the sigil is concentrated on, as a mental image, mantra or drawn form. Time s when sigils may be charged: during magickal trance, great elation, fear, anger and/or embarrassment. After holding the sigil in the mind, banish it with laughter. A record of sigil work should be kept, but not in a way that could cause deliberation or thought over sigilized desire. Metamorphosis The transmutation of the mind to magickal consciousness has often been called the Great Work. Its far reaching purpose is to find the True Will. Metamorphosis is a n excercise in willed restructuring of the mind. All attempt to reorganize the mind involve a duality between conditions as they are, and the preferred condition. Religions are based on the lie that one can or ought to have one or the other, say, joy and sin, according to them you can have joy without having sin, but the duality in nature proves that wrong, that is why everyone is a sinner! Anyway, High magick recognizes the dualistic co ndition but does not care whether life is bittersweet or sweet or sour; rather it seeks to achieve any perspective at will. Any state of mind might be chosen for transmutation, but there are specific virtu es to the ones given. The first, b reaks the tension, and clears the air after magickal trance, which is Laughter. The second is a specific agains obsession with the magickal practices in the third section, that is non-attachement and non-disinterest. Attaining these states of mind is accomplished by a process of ongoing meditation. One tries to enter the spirit of the condition whenever possible. You want to utter feel the spirit of the emotions or thoughts. And you think of the desired result at other times. By th is method a new mental habit can be established. Laughter is the highest emotion, for it can contain any of the other emotions, from ecstacy to grief. Crying is only an underdeveloped for of laughter. The trick with laughter is, to laugh at all things, even in neutral and ghastly events. Though at first, it ma y be forced, however one can learn to smile inwardly at all things. Non attachment and non disinterest best describes the magick condition of acting without lust of result. It is ve ry difficult for most to decided on something, then do it purely for its own sake. Yet it is precisely this ability wh ich is required to execute magickal acts. On ly single pointed awareness will d o. Attachement is both positive and negative, for aversion is its o ther face. Attachment ton ones personality, ambitions etc. will p rove limiting in time. On the other hand, it is fa tal to lose complete interest in these things, for they are ones symb olic syste m or magickal reality. By d enying the hand that spoils and touching the magickal reality lightly, then you will gain enough freedom to act.

Satrinah> Lucifer beyond Lucifer Satrinah> Lucifer is an incarnate being of many cultures and beliefs. Manifestation of Lucifer can said to have taken place in almost all cultures of ancient society. Pan the God of the Pagans, The Nature god is also a great spirit whom came to be known as Lucifer. Marduk, the great slayer of the ancient ones, the anciet ones whom were the first of all gods Marduk defied. Marduk has come to be known as Lucifer. The point im tryin g to get at is in magick. Satrinah> no matter what deity one uses or calls on for assistance there is that spark of Lucifer. You conjure the oldest of spirits and it is Lucifer so in fact the use of any other spirits in ritual can be most helpfull as they may hold certain attributes which the Lucifer incarnate does not have currently.. Satrinah> any questions?. Esos_the_Great> where does god fit in? * |XUL| looks at own ass |XUL|> not here Satrinah> god doesnt fit in. Satrinah> god was not even mentioned.

Satrinah Nagash Mind Control When learning to control your mind, and to reach a magickal trance, you need to be able to control the rest of your body so that you can make your mind do what you need it to do. The best way is to start off by training your body to be completely motionless. Some may think that this is ve ry easy, however, it is not. It is o ne of the more difficult things you will have to do. The benefits of this are not only helpful to your mind, but also good for your body as well. It is like being able to relax your whole body at once. The method of accomplishment this is as follows: Arrange your body in a comfortable position, this could be any postition, be it sittin g, standing or what have you. Remain in that position for as long as possible. Try not to blink or move any of your body at all. Do not let the mind wander with long trains of thought. Observe yourself passively, so as not to make you think about what you feel or see. What appeared to be a comfortable postition may become agonizing in time, but persist with it! Set time aside each day to do this excercise. If you can do this 15 times in a row, on separate days, for over 5 minutes each, it is time to move on to the next excercise. Breathing, a very important body function. To do this you need to be able to do the motionlessness excercise, they go hand in hand, in a way. The aim with this excercise is to use the full capacity of your lungs without any added muscular effort or strain. This is also a good excercise for smokers...He lps you breathe! The method is as follows: Stay as motionless as possible and begin to make your breathing slower and deeper. The lungs can be empty or full, and you can hold it, to lengthen the time between breaths. When this can be done for 30 minutes, you can move on to stopping thought. The motionlessness and breathing techniques help prepare you for not thinking or stopping thought. Stopping thought is the beginnings of magickal trance. This trance is what you will need to call on will, whenever you want when you perform magick. Th e method is as follows: While motionless, and 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"breathing deeply, begin to withdraw the mind from thoughts that may arise. The attempt to do this will show you that your mind is full of activity. On ly determination can win even a few seconds of mental silence, this is good, even if only a little bit at first. It is p rogress. Aim fo r complete control over arising thoughts and try to lengthen the periods of total silence in your mind. Like physical motionlessness, the mental motionlessness, it n eeds to be practiced every day, preferably at set times. This is a continuing excercise that one should do, no matter the level of magickian. Orgasmic Invocation by Rev. Xul The goal of this essay is to outline and explain the bases behind invocation through orgasm brought on by sexual intercourse or self-stimu lation. Sex Magick has been a well-known type of ritual for a long time and is popular among many different types of mystics fro m Chaos Magickians to Hermetics. It's attributes will b e described herein. Basic Prin ciple The basic principle behind sex magick is simp le. The feelings induced by sexual acts and the subsequent orgasm(s) p ut off a great deal of energy. When two people engage in sexual intercourse, their energies intertwine and become as one. This act in itself doubles the amount of energy output and when focused on a certain goal enhances the rate of success in a ritual greatly. Org asms are the climax of this union and act as a supreme outletting of energy, whether creational, pleasureable, or both; and when focused, can invoke almost anything. Singlular Sex Magick (aka masturbation), though not as powerful, can still be just as effective, because of the increased ease in focus. Whether or not the goal is focused on throughout the process of sex or masturbation, invocation can still be attained with an extremely focused orgasm, this being the strongest output of energy in the act. Common Uses The most common use of Sex Magick is in the conjuration of lust, a ritual aimed at attaining sexual relations with partner of choosing by sending the sexual energy to that person in hopes of influencing their sexual drive in your direction. In this sort of ritual, the person will ma sturbate to a depiction or thought of the intended goal, or will so metimes act it out. When orgasm is a ttained, the person will concentrate all of the energy from it into the goal, thereby sending the energy to the person to influence the goal. Another use of Sex Magick is in vocation. The intense energy put-off in a sex act and orgasm can be used to invoke various spirits, demons or even events1. In this scenario, the person will perform a ritual in a manner pertaining to the goal (ie. invoking a spirit to perform a duty, invoking a thunderstrom, invoking the inflow of cash, etc.) and climax the rite with a sex act, thereby putting an extreme amount of energy into the goal. Creational Sex Magick Though this particular kind's success is re ally dependent on the magickian's beliefs, it ca n be applied to any kind of situation. The common use of Creational Sex Magick is to use a sexual union to create either a concept or spirit-child, the product of the two souls intertwining. The rites to these are very dependent on the person and really only work well when written wholly by the people involved. The Personalization of Ritual By Re v.

Preliminary Explanation of the Four Princes of Hell By Rev. Frederick Na gash The Four Crowned Princes of Hell Lucifer Satan 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Belial Leviathan The Four Corners of Evocation Lucifer - Dire ction=East, Number=Nine, Element=Air, Co lor=White. Satan - Direction=South, Number=Six, Ele ment=Fire, Color=Red. Belial - Dire ction=North, Number=One, Element=Earth, Color=Black. Leviathan - Direction=West, Number=Three, Element=Water, Color=Blue. Attributes of the Four Princes Lucifer - The light bringer, guiding our way to wisdom from the darkness of false truth. The air we breathe, from the east. Who's number is nine, as nine is the number of the pride as any number nine is multiplied into can be added to form nine (Example....9x5=45...4+5=9)! Satan - The south, whom represents the element of fire which burns inside of us in the form of unbridled emotion (Love, Hate, Rage etc..). W ho's number is that of six as six is th e number of the Name Jesus six hundred sixty six to be exact (Jesus=18=6+6+6). Belial - Who holds power over the north, who's element is the very earth which represents staying firm to your beliefs, solidness, not straying from your goals. What number better represents firmn ess then one, the number that is the base of all other numbers? Leviathan - The dragon of the waters, who shows the sign of mans true godhood. Just as water can create and destroy life, so can man! Leviathans number is Three the number of unpredictability as it can go into the numbers of Satan and Lucifer yet not Belial which represents mankind's wild streak, not always being so solid. Leviathan resides over the powers of the west. Purifying The Chambers By Re v. F rederick N agash This is a small, short ritual to puri fy t he airs and dra w on t he magickal forc es of t he particular ri tual chamber.

Xul I must first a dvise you in why this is su ch a short essay. It is me ant to be basic in its construction to allow one as much space needed to utilize the template for personalization. Normally, I wo uld not feel the need to state this beforehand, but there is an amusing but often unproductive trend on occult and satanic related websites these days that demands this statement's inclusion: the need for preconstructed rituals. Though some of these \"to-the-detail\" ritual templates can be helpful, they leave little or no room for personalization, one of the very mso t important things in a ritual. It mu st come from you to be the utmost fruitful. With that all said, here is the guide. The first th ing you need is a purpose. There is no point in doing a ritual just for the sake of doing it. It is not something to practice, it's something to utilize when needed. A tool, not a show. Common purposes are: Love, Protection, Lust, and Destruction. The majority of these listed are with a positive polarity; wh ile destruction falls into a negative catagory. Many will te ll you that these come back on you and karma will co me for you. This is generally false and only true if you believe it to be so. When you project energy believing that it will co me back on you, you are assigning yourself to the goal as well as the intended target, thus pulling it back on yourself. The main reason I'd assume this comes from would be the inclusion in many cultures of god-fearing and the stripping of nature's laws of survival. Ignore this, for the only true laws are that of nature. The second thing to consider is me thod. The most basic consists of a depiction of your target and you doing whatever is neccesary to project the feelings and energy upon that depiction. Other more common practices include Evocation and Invocation. Evocation is channelling your energies to force a spirit into a specified area and thus commanding it to carry out your goal. It can be commonly found in Goetic and Enochian texts. Invocation is channelling energy to call a spirit to where you are and asking it to carry out the request. The ways of going about this vary from person to person and should be entirely up to you. I suggest reading be done on all methods before deciding what you would like to utilize and how you would go about it. Here are some things to consider for a ritual. Location - Where would you like to carry out your ritual? it is sa id often that a quiet place where you will absolutely not be disturbed is best, as concentration and focus are vital to a successful working. Setting/Mood - This should be defined by the goal. Whatever assists in attaining the maximum output of emotion pertaining to your goal is best. Incense, Candles, Music, and Oils are all commonly used. Well, I hope this could be of some use to the newcomer and even give maybe a bit of insight or grounding to the adept. Alwa ys remember, you have to want your goal to happen or it won't. The Ritua l of the Enoc hian Pra yer By Rev. Frederick Na gash Before Before I go further, I must inform you that this is the first plane of Outer Torelia. This is a ritual of praise or hymn. During this ritual, offerings or sacrifice may be made. This is the perfect ritual to increase spiritual connection with both Torelia and your Deities. Attire A ritual robe is required to perform this ritual. The Ritua l Purify the Chamber! Envision your god(s) being conjured for about 10 minutes. Next, draw out a sigil for the Deity being called upon and put it in your bowl. The Creative Step 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Write a poem or song for the Deity. Recite Caosgi, Vovina, Oxiayal! Action Ring the bell! Turn off all lights and ignite the candles and incense. Envision just the sigil of the Deity being conjured for about 2 or 3 minutes. Now recite the Enochian Prayer to Zorabia and ring the bell! You may now make sacrifice or an offering to your Deity and say: \"Zorabia\" Ring the bell! Banishing To allow the Deity to leave and return to it's realm once again, simply sprinkle sulfur over the sigil in the bowl and ignite it while saying: \"It is done\" Ring the bell! Ritua l Mechanics by Rev. Xul The act of the ritual is simp le and there are two basic types. The two basics are as thus: 1. making a request to a certain spirit or deity, which involves either invoking or evoking the spirit or deity and then outputting the emotion for the request, or 2. sending the energy to the person directly through means of extreme emotional output such as masturbation, self-mutilation, laughter, cryin g, etc. to influence the person towards the goal. For example, when a ritual requesting something of Lucifer is commited, it is b asically sending the emotion you evoke to him to do one of three things: put forth the will of Ab-Zu to make this request come about, call upon legions or specific sp irits to carry out the request, or to carry out the request himself. The main basis and continual factor behind all of this is emotional output. The release of energy by this is essential to the success of the ritual. Emotion, feeling, will... a ll forms of energy, which is that which makes up your spirit. Within your vessel of flesh lies energy, which is called soul, spirit, chi, ka, feeling, emotion, sentience, etc.; and that is the key to ritual success. Rituals By Deacon Vorphalack This tends to be a more than one Answer thingy, 'cause many of you would now say \"Rituals are necessary for success\", others would say \"Rituals are totally Obsolete\", and some would say \"I like them, but I don't need them\". Different answers for different views, as always, so I would like to tell you what I think about that question..... Are Rituals Obsolete? First An swer: Yes! Second Answer: No, they are necessary! 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Long Answer: I think this will co nfuse you, right? Fine, that is how it should be. Let me explain... If you are alone, why do you do a ritual, 'cause you would change something., but thinking straight forward, the ritual only helps you to direct your will in to the right way. So, if it only helps you, you can learn to gain the same goal without the Ritual by directing your will by yourself. If there are more people, trying to reach a goal together, there applies the same as by a single person, but it can be very difficult to get their energies together, and here is a Ritual a real handy thing, because all involved persons will p ut their energies together without big problems. As you can see, a Ritual is still n ot necessary, but is getting more important, so when will a Ritual became necessary? When the Person and/or Group is not just doing it to accomplish a goal, but also tries to get Self awareness, Fun, and that special feeling only a Ritual can give. A Ritu al is necessary if you do it for the Ritual itself, not just to success in something, and that is something every Magickan/Witch should do from time to time, 'cause it gives you a good feeling and makes you stronger. 01.31.2000 - Secrets to Successful Magick By Rev. Satrinah Nagash There are many things that you learn in magickal texts...Ho w to set up an altar. What implements you may need. Ingredients for various rites, and etc. They tell you everything you need to know about how the rite works. Eve n though you may do everything that that book may say, but you still dont succeed. No one can figure out what they did wrong. Well, there are something things books will n ever tell you. And that is what this class is about. These 'secrets' are within yourself. Your ego and your confidence. Books will n ever tell you how to use these things, nor will th ey tell you that they are essential. It is th e main Secret behind successful magick. Have you ever talked to someone who is very successful? Dont they seem to be conceited? I know I have run into that many times. That is their confidence at work. But confidence can hurt you too. But first, I will e xplain what good confidence is, and then how over confidence can hinder you. Good Self Confidence. It is wh en you are not afraid of anything, when you dont doubt yourself, or anything you do. It is th e part of you that says \"You can do it\" and it drives you towards your goals no matter what they may be. Now, some people may seem like they have good confidence, but in reality, they inwardly doubt. These are the magickians with a 50/50 success rate. Their self esteem on the outside seems good, but inside, they still d oubt. Those will low self confidence and low self esteem are those who's magick will n ever work. This is because they dont see themselves highly, nor do they think that they can do it. Ove rcoming this is a major part of magickal development. How to achieve this varies from person to person. But to start, you must believe in yourself. You must know that what you are doing is going to work, and never doubt that in your head. The Daily Ritu al of Reawakening is a good start for building your confidence, for in that right, you are proclaiming that no on shall remove you from your throne. Now how overconfidence works against you. When you are over confident, you think that you are invincible. Magickaly speaking, there is always someone better than you in the world somewhere. There is a point however, when you are almost indefeatable...by that, it me ans that the one you are warring with, will re cieve damage, but so will yo u. And that weakens you. If you keep that up, you will weaken youself, even though you think you are strong and powerful...then you try a rite, where you have to be in full strength, then you hurt yourself really bad. This goes many ways. Confidence is good, over confidence is detrimental. As far as ego is concerned...It is simila r to the confidence thing. However, ego most time s is bad. To big of an ego will ca use you to lose more than win. Xtians have that problem with their self-righteous bull. Wicca is the same way. They do magick, and they are white light so that gives them an ego that they are \"Good\". The satanic ego, which is different from every other ego there is. This is because we are considered not like everyone else or freaks, our egos must be different. We have to have an ego, 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"yet still be approachable. I think that explains itself. Another secret to successful magick that I did not mention, is the accentuation of various parts of the ritual. The words, how it is wo rded, etc. For example, when doing a Black Mass, you need to make sure that the Four Crown Princes hear you, know that you are paying a tribute to them for their services, even tho you commanded them to do so. Respect is a major aspect of the accentuation. This also applies other types of rituals. Such as healing, you want to make sure the person or yourself gets healed, you need to accentuate that. Or if yo u are trying to attain something, be it spiritual or material. You need to accentuate your goal. Accentuations also include pronunciation. IF you are working in magickal languages, such as enochian, or sumerian, etc, you have to say them right for it to work. If yo u dont, then the spirit or entity you are talking to or commanding will not understand you, therefore, not complete what you are asking. These are the little known secrets of magick and what makes it successful. The Self Baptismal into the Glory of He ll By Rev. Frederick Na gash 00* You must send proof that you preformed this rite to one of the Tribunal members for the Church of Lucifer to recognize your Magickal name and official rank. Proof may be audio or video of the ritual taking place. Before- Before the ritual you will need to have the proper altar as well as the knowledge of how to purify the Chambers. This should be the first ritu al you ever perform with the C.O.L . in Magick. Attire - Straight black clothing or a ritual robe is required. The Ritua l- Purify the Chamber! Place your hand over a candle and say: \"By Satan, be blessed by fire\" Wave air in your face and say: \"By Lucifer, be blessed by air\" Sprinkle salt on your head and say: \"By Belial, be blessed by earth\" Moisten your brow with water and say: \"By Leviathan, be blessed by water\" \"Zorabia\" Now raise your left arm and hit the inside of your forearm with the \"FLAT END\" of the blade from your ritual dagger and say: \"I now bear the invisible mark of the Church of Lucifer and always shall, Zorabia!\" Ring the bell! The Basics of Tore lian Magick By Rev. Frederick Na gash 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Torelian Magick encompasses the basic laws of astral travel, yet applies them differntly. Torelian Magick utilizes the 3 main human elements- Min d, Body, and Sirit as one microcosm. Also \"Torelians\" use the 4 basic elements of Alchemy-Ea rth, Air, Fire , and water as well as the added Universe or Macrocosm. To relia has 6 planes of travel broken into 2 sections of study, the Outer plane and the Inner plane. The Outer plane is an initiate period to this realm and into the higher state of being, where as the Inner plane is \"Torelian High Magick\" and encompasses that past the physical realm. The three Outter planes are: • The Plane of Hymn or Praise • The Plane of the Inner Gods Reserrection • The Plane of Minor Zorabia 2-4-5-7-8 The Three Inner planes are: • The Plane of Spirits (Necromancy) • The Plane of Dreams • The Plane of Major Zorabia 1-3-6-9 Outter Torelia, while being lesser magick is ve ry difficult, The Plane of Hymn or Praise can only be crossed once you can obtain spiritual connection between the selves and the God form. By g iving praise to the god form, you are in return giving praise to yourself. The Plane of the Inner Gods Ressurection, can only be crossed once Gnosis can be controlled and used at any given point for the effect of superiority over all other living things, both spiritual and physical. The Plane of Minor Zorabia (Zorabia meaning Demons)involves the construction and conjuration of lesser demons or beings for a variety of esoteric matters. The Lesser being conjured may also be one which you have researched and know everything about such as Baal, or Phul etc... The Three Inner Planes of Torelia can only be seen and crossed once the outer planes have been crossed. The Plane of Spirits involves some extreme Necromantic rites to summon the spirits of the dead to physical form for various Occu lt reasons. The Plane of Dreams is a plane unlike any other, most people have been to the plane of dreams but how many can say they can control and completely discipher the dreams true meaning? Lastly the Plane of Major Zorabia, or the conjuration of greater spirits, in volves ceremonial offerings, extremely long ceremonies, and a very hightened state of gnosis. Gre ater Gods or Devils are called on when no other will do... \"Torelians\" must fully dedicate almost all of their spare time to practice, this is wh y my Ord er is so selective of it's members. It is n ot enough to read and comprehend, you must apply the techniques. Zorabia is something I recieved during evocation on the Torelian Plane. I summoned Mammon and ask for wealth, instead I recieved Zorabia. I did'nt know what Zorabia was until I began useing it in ritual. Through (Hebraic) Numerology I found Zorabia contains all of the numbers of the Four Princes of Hell. I choose to no longer use Shemhamforash (A word comprised of all the Hebrew names of god as one) as I now use the more fitting Zorabia! As you can see \"Torelians\" must be fully dedicated to the occult and are not closed minded to any facet of occult studies. My stu dies of Torelia have assisted me far beyond my normal constraints of mundane Magickal practice. Welcome to Torelia!!! Zorabia Staring into the Dragons Eye By Re v.

Torelia By Rev. Frederick Na gash Torelia is a plane unlike most would encounter on the astral plane. I have written all of the Orders' Magickal practices while in travel to Torelia. Torelia has three outer planes: • The Plane of Hymn or Praise • The Plane of the Gods (Resurrection of Ones' Inner God) • The Plane of Zorabia Minor 2-4-5-7-8 Torelia also encompasses three inner planes: • The Plane of Spirits (Necromancy) • The Plane of Dreams • The Plane of Major Zorabia 1-3-6-9 The three outer planes are traveled through mental preparation and training, while the three inner planes are traveled once the three outer planes are mastered. Through Zorabia, we learn magick must always move forward and never linger, or it can become boring and repetitive. For this reason the Order will co nstantly evolve into more then just a singular facet of studies. We will be searching for \"Magickians\" with the title of Magus in our Order to form new sects of the Order based on varied occult studies! All \"Torelians\" are encouraged to study Torelian Magick as well as any other facet of the left-hand- path. Torelian Magick involves using the four basic elements of alchemy-Ea rth, Air, Fire , and Water as well as Universe, Will, Energy, and Imagery. Eve rything in Torelian Magick represents and has reason for being there, the altar being the prime example of this fact. The Mind, Body, and Spirit being all encompassing as the microcosm and the universe being vast and unexplored as the macrocosm, are another thing represented and used in Torelian Magick, this is wh y training is needed. After the student reaches the rank of \"Apprentice\", they become just that under one of the \"Magus\" of one of the sect. of the Order or directly under Rev. Frederick Na gash 0*. The Order hopes to bring back the true occult traditions of the world and eradicate the mass perception of it. Through this facet of Magick we hope to accomplish this! Hail Torelia!!! Zorabia!!!

Vampirism Class on #colucifer By Rev. Satrinah Nagash This is the log from #colucifer. <Satrinah> How many people actually believe that drinking blood makes you young or immo rtal? Well, first of all, blood drinking is not what actual vampirism is. Th at is something Hollywood created. True Vampirism is n ot an act, but is intentional...and anything intentional is a magickal act...Vampirism is magick... <Satrinah> Every intentional act of magick you perform, is a form of vampirism in one way or another. <Satrinah> For example...when you do a healing or destructive rite...you are manipulating energies. Depending on how you manipulate those very same energies, is wh at distinguishes you from being a vampire or a magickian <Satrinah> Note that 'Being a Vampire' does NOT me an you suck others blood, are immortal in a physical sense, Nor does it have to do with fangs. I am sure most know this...but lately...there seems to be more people who don't <Satrinah> any questions? <Kreep-> none so far <DcnXul> nope not here <Satrinah> When using energies, you use either passive or active. Rev. Nagash had a class on that, a month or so ago. <Satrinah> When you use the passive energies, these energies are not vampiric. Active energies are vampiric, wh ich is found in the human both mentally and phyisically, the earth and the spirit. These are the energies used in invocation and evocation. The active/vampiric energy is wh at gets magick accomplished. Negative energy falls under the category of blood, which is a passive energy. It sta ys within <Satrinah> . It sta ys with in to sustain itself. Were as the active energy is positive energy. <Satrinah> any questions>? <Necro666> NOOOOOOOPPPE 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"<DcnXul> so far none here <Satrinah> Why is vampiric energy a positive energy. This is because positive energy is something that you can take from everything around you, and manipulate it to do your will. W hat is a vampire again? A being that takes energy for its personal use. <Satrinah> When one uses this energy, one is being vampiric for taking the energy and using it as one wishes, but can be utilized for healing or destruction. Vampiric ma gick, is th e magick of everyone who uses this energy every day, but there are always exceptions to the rule. Vampirism is n ot merely magick though, it is a lso a state of mind, or a philosophy. It is th e predatorial nature of man. A survival of the fittest type philosophy. <Satrinah> . It is th e predatorial nature of man. A survival of the fittest type philosophy. However, the vampire is also made up of three prime elements of human nature. Social, Taught, and Carnal. They have learned true evolution by not denying any facet of their nature. <Satrinah> any questions? <Kreep-> nope doing great satrinah <Satrinah> The Social Nature of the Vampire is this, in dealing with people, knowing how to handle various situations without fail or regret. It is simp ly interaction with others. <DcnXul> so is an Akhkharu really a vampire or just what Hollywood would call one? <Satrinah> Akhkharu, is the Sumerian equivalent of the vampire... <DcnXul> it sucks the blood of a man so as to become a man but it never really becomes one, right? <Satrinah> In all the Sumerian texts I have access to..the vampire(Akhkharu) was never referred to as a blood sucker, but as one who takes energy <DcnXul> k <Satrinah> and all vampires really are, are those who take energy and uses it for their own gain, which is very satanic as well <DcnXul> to become a man, which is its o wn desire to use them for...k I g ot it <Satrinah> exactly <Satrinah> any other questions <DcnXul> k <DcnXul> none here <Satrinah> The Taught Nature of the Vampire is what you're brought up as, and what your parents teach you as values. <Satrinah> Now some people may think that means if they were raised xtian, that those are the values taught. This is not true, you have to be able to separate the actual values from religion. Such as, for example, Thou shall not steal. Well we all know that is not a good idea, because we would go to jail. Common sense. Stealing and religion have nothing to do with each other. Common sense, is something some ppl are <Satrinah> Common sense, is something some ppl are born with and others develop, and then there are the few who never have common sense. <Kreep-> no q's here| <Kreep-> good point <Satrinah> The Carnal Nature of the Vampire is just that. All ca rnal, natural instincts and emotions are the carnal nature. This would include love, hate, violence, survival, etc. The carnal nature is the instincts are the result of the Social Nature in a way...If so meone provokes you in a bad way, your carnal nature takes over to kick th at persons ass. 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"<Satrinah> . Another example, when someone says hi to you nicely walking down the street, that is not threatening, and the carnal nature does not react, because your Social Nature knows that that is not necessary. <Satrinah> Those are the three elements of the vampire. But one is a vampire only when the three elements are mastered and one has full control over them. <Satrinah> Ok, does anyone have any questions on the Three elements <Satrinah> ? <DcnXul> all set here :) <Kreep> nope well explained satrinah <Satrinah> Now, does anyone know how to use those elements....? <Kreep> hmmm <Drakon> ave <DcnXul> well really they can be used in everyday life <Kreep> all the time? <Satrinah> yes all the time <Necro666> I think so <DcnXul> i think you described it well on that end <Drakon> what is the subject on tonight? <Necro666> Mind Manipulation? <Drakon> k <Satrinah> True Vampirism, d rakon <Satrinah> Nec, in a way... <Kreep> is it used for survival? <DcnXul> yep <Satrinah> yes, it is je sse <Satrinah> ok, in the survival aspect... <Satrinah> you get stranded somewhere, your hungry... <Satrinah> what do your instincts tell you to do>? <Kreep> find food <DcnXul> eat, defend, find or make shelter <Satrinah> yes... <DcnXul> hunt <Satrinah> the carnal nature of the vampire, will do whatever it takes to get that food... <Satrinah> you see all the beggars outside, beggin for money <Satrinah> they are using their ability as a vampire to get what they want, they know how to get ppl to 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"pity them and give them money <Kreep> will-to-power? <Satrinah> will to power, yes <Kreep> cool <DcnXul> ive done that while bored waiting for a ride to come get me lol <Kreep> LOL <Satrinah> but in essence, you have to know how to use them abilities... <Satrinah> you have to know what will ma ke ppl give you what you want <Satrinah> lol <Satrinah> observation is a very good tool <Satrinah> when using your vampiric abilities <Satrinah> always know your surroundings, watch the ppl around you... <Gigim_Xu|> kinda like your circle <Satrinah> gig, as in the ppl you know? <Satrinah> every friend is a potential enemy, remember that... <Kreep> the closer you get to them, the greater the threat they become? <Gigim_Xu|> well if you expand your circle the more you control right..? <Satrinah> kreep, not always... <Kreep> with of course the exception of a selected few ><Satrinah> gig, sometimes, but to feed off of someone like that, it not always a good idea... <Gigim_Xu|> true <Satrinah> you see, as far as control goes, yah, controlling things is good, but the main thing you should be concerned about is controlling YOUR sp ace... <Satrinah> Your World. <Satrinah> not everyone else's, unless they really deserve it <Gigim_Xu|> that's what i meant <Gigim_Xu|> not to control others <Satrinah> yes, but by observation, you will kn ow who is what, and who to look out for <Kreep> shouldn't you question everyone? <Kreep> even those you know well? <Satrinah> i question ppl when they give me a reason * Satrinah is easy going like that <Satrinah> if you question too much, they could be wary of you, and that is they're carnal instinct <Drakon> couldn't it be the other way around as well? <Drakon> as the vampire, asking a lot 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"<Satrinah> yes drakon, it does work like that <Drakon> in order to get something <Drakon> k <Satrinah> everyone has vampiric qualities, it is ju st that some are better at using them than others <Satrinah> and some, even, don't know they even exist <Drakon> what about when it comes to relationships? <Satrinah> relationships are based on trust... <Drakon> isn't there a give and take factor? <Kreep> very true <Drakon> i agree <Satrinah> but, with relationships, you have to really know the person to trust <Kreep> yeah you do, and even then sometimes they can pull a fast one on you <Satrinah> sometimes...not everyone is fool proof all the time... <Drakon> comp is acting up <Drakon> sorry <Satrinah> wb everyone <Satrinah> thats okie <Necro666> Satrinah... are you a Master Vampire? <Satrinah> Nec...lets just say i know the subject quite well <Satrinah> well, does anyone have any other questions? <Drakon> hmm... <Kreep> I cant think of any right now <DcnXul> im set <Gigim_Xu|> so would you say a vampire is the true satanist... <Satrinah> in a sense, but it is mo re like the vampirism is mo re of an attribute of the true satanist Zorabia By Re v.

Frederick Na gash I - Princ ipia Magicka Magickal practice should not be confined to simply ritual or ceremonial it should be made very personal and not solely defined by one man or women’s perception. Magick should become a tailored art to fit personal lifestyles and individuals and should never be boring or repetitive. Certain forms of traditional magickal practice exist solely in the human subconscious and can not be put into words. Certain daily rituals we perform every morning can be considered magickal such as certain people need to drink coffee to feel complete in the morning and some may need to get washed and dressed before even stepping outside of the bedroom all of which make a day feel or seem complete. Magick should not be confined to a ritual chamber either, it should be where ever you see fit, me ntal or psychic magick should and is performed everyday sometimes without you realizing it. The Evil eye which makes others feel uncomfortable is one way of using magick with out using magick. Ch aos magick is a complete system of magickal practice, yet so is what ever one creates him/herself. For magick to be accomplished “properly” one need only look at their accomplishments and realize that magick has played some key role in it’s development. Once true magickal potential is realized there is no stopping the unstoppable force within you. II - Ma gicka Extremis Magick is a n art form with in itself, and within every art form their is the artist. Yo u play the key role in how far you take your magickal progress, only you can define you. Using certain elements from daily practice can lead you to ritual magick later in the evening. Such acts are “perfect” if done whole heartedly and without doubt. Every day of your life a ritual is performed, you wake up, start your day, wind down in the late afternoon than sleep at night. To break such rituals is ye t another magickal act known as “Metamorphosis” by drawing from this rite it may lead you to yet another facet of magick, Gnosis. Gn osis is u sed as a form of trance like state the magickian can move into when depravation of certain kind happens. Going days with out sleep is one way to reach the state of Gnosis, going days with out eating is another. Also Gnosis can be reached at any point in which pain becomes unbearable. To reach gnosis simply concentrate on nothing and completely clear your thoughts, like passing through the head of a needle. The two methods combined equals the state of gnosis. Cle aring your mind of all things is the most difficult of all things in magickal practice, your mind races day to day with a million thoughts and stopping them is hard and takes practice. Meditation can also lead to Gnosis by someone whom is very experienced in it, as can some forms of chemognosis (Bu t chemognosis is h ighly un- recommended). Also a deep understanding of concentration is needed to perform magick acts. Yo u must be able to focus, Visu alize and concentrate without looking. This too is a very difficult task but becomes second nature in time, it has been called many names throughout history but my fa vorite is the evil eye. III - How to De liver the Evil Eye The evil eye is probably the most important component to the Sorcerer or Witch. The evil eye allows one to perform almost anything at the blink of an eye, from the greatest destruction ritual in less then 10 seconds to the most elaborate ceremonial rituals (Mentally) once again in about 30 seconds. The evil eye should be used to make others feel disturbed in your presence. Also a good use for the evil 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"eye is if a confrontation is to ensue it will in stantly strike fear in those whom would wish you harm. Th e best way to learn the evil eye is to sit with your hands in your lap in front of a mirror with one lit black candle in front of you. Stare through the flame of the candle into the mirror and through your own eyes without blinking. Now allow yourself to think solely of something which will enrage you but stay calm and continue to stare. Focus hard on your pupils then attempt to zone out or reach the gnosis state, when you reach this state of nothingness you have stared through your own eyes. In time you will gain the instant power to use the evil eye at will. Yo u must be careful on how you use it as you may strike down someone you don’t want to harm that much. In all things in magick being careful and responsible are the two prime laws. IV - Bla ck vs. White To the true Magickian magick has no limits o r boundaries and cannot be classified under any one practice. White magick is su pposedly magick done without ill intent and never for the gratification of solely oneself. I ask you by performing a healing ritual to some it may be white magick however you also are gratified in the knowledge that you helped someone therefore the theories of White Magick are without a doubt “Black”. Bla ck Magick is su pposedly magick done with an ill intent and for the sole purpose of gratifying ones self. I ask again if conjuring a demon to protect your family fro m the greater evil of humanity or to destroy someone who would hurt you or a family me mbers, is th is evil or is it truly white? I purpose we as strong willed powerful incarnate should not concern ourselves with black and white only what is in our heart. If ma gick is d one from the heart, It will n ever fail and will be as pure as the driven snow weather dealing with demons or a god. It is u p to the magickian on what he studies but there should be no limits o n what is black or white or evil and good. We are pure beings during magick we are purified in the image of our own divinity and therefore if we do our “will” ca nnot be harmed and our magick will p ure. V - Te rminology I call myse lf a Sorcerer or Male witch, some have asked why I choose not to use the term Warlock or Pagan and well the answer is simp le. Warlock was a term given to male witches during the “Burning Times” it lite rally means “Oath Breaker”, all true Magickians will n ever break a bond or oath and therefore are loyal to one another and themselves. Pagan was another term given derogatorily to all witches meaning “Country Dwe ller” I will n ot recognize the term Pagan either as it was given in a derogatory manner by the uninitiated. The Term “witch ” is not simply a female term, a witch is simp ly one whom weaves magick same goes with sorcerer, magi and magus. I perform all forms of ritual and magickal practice so I personally use the term Magus or sorcerer. VI - Luc ifer beyond Luc ifer Lucifer is an incarnate being of many cultures and beliefs. Manifestation of Lucifer can said to have taken place in almost all cultures of ancient society. Pan the God of the Pagans, The Nature god is also a great spirit whom came to be known as Lucifer. Marduk, the great slayer of the ancient ones, the anciet ones whom were the first of all gods Marduk defied. Marduk has come to be known as Lucifer. The point im tryin g to get at is in magick no matter what deity one uses or calls on for assistance there is that spark of Lucifer. You conjure the oldest of spirits and it is Lucifer so in fact the use of any other spirits in ritual can be most helpfull as they may hold certain attributes which the Lucifer incarnate does not have currently. VII - Zora bia Zorabia shall be our secret word, Torelia our secret place and the earth our home while in our mortal bodies. Zorabia translates from the Hellish Language to Spirit or pure being, so from this day forth I am known as Zorabia. The four Princes of Hell also form Zorabia and the very word should be treated as holy or of their word. The First of the Scrolls of Ain – Of Virtue s by Rev. Frederick Na gash 1. Harm none, lest they harm you. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"2. Show kindness to all, even your enemies! For they are less likely to suspect your secret workings agains’t them. Be sinister in private and merciless magickally! 3. Reflect on your words before you say them. 4. Refuse not your woman or man if they will. 5. Teach in children the virtues given. 6. Never impose upon anothers will. 7. Reflect on your deeds before you do them. 8. All things of this world are yours. 9. Love the few, but love wholly. 10. Hate any, whom would impose upon thy will. 11. Preach only to those who wish hear it. 12. Preserve thy religion of the divine truths. 13. Trust is not blindly given, everyone must earn your trust first. 14. Hate with as much passion as you love! The Second of the Scrolls of Ain – Liber Furv us Ain De us by Rev. Frederick Na gash 1. We are literal godforms, cre ation, destruction, love and hate are at our disposal. In our being we strive towards the Magnum Opus to create for ourselves the new self. We are the rulers of our own destiny, manifestation of our will dictates this to each and every one of us. Everything in our world is a manifestation of our own living will! 2. Humanity is much more than just another animal, we are spiritual beings capable of mass creation and manifestation, that is what seperates us from the animals. To accept the theory of evolution while it has missing components is to blindly accept it. We came therefore we are! 3. Ain is the highest law, anything below Ain is lower in nature to it! Ain is the microcosm that came from the macrocosm to forge a unity between the “stars” and the earth. 4. Gharb I Mutlaq is the absolute void, the great mind that performs the magnum opus. Through the Gharb I Mutlaq, egrigor and phantasmata as well as all forms of deities may be created with the assistance of the will and visualization. These deities come about from the aethers or ignis leonis, fire of the lion. All cthonic spirits come about from the aethers as well, this including Saytan. 5. Altered states of consciecness are the means to achieveing true personal and magickal power, this comes about through the abosolute knowledge of the self. Self-Realization, Self-Actualization and Self-Creation should be any magickians highest goals, if it is not that person cannot call himself a worthy magickian. 6. False martyrdom, pity and false hope are tools of mental enslavement and weakness. If someone has a problem, it is just that, their problem! Only they can change their current situation and make it better for themselves! Those 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"whom confide in you with their problems should not be pittied but should be given the knowledge to change themselves and their situation for the better. Pity leads to ruination of the self, pity none and you will save yourself first and foremost! 7. Deny no facet of the self be it Carnal or social, Instinctual or taught! You must find the balance inbetween the two selves and live within them, this is known as walking by the eclipse. Pure anger and hatred towards everything is unhealthy as is pure love and joy. Love the few, Respect the few, Trust the few! 8. One must be able to control his/her emotions, with control of ones emotions (s)he can better fosuc their emotion towards the intended working and have a greater success ratio. In dealings involving emotion anger often comes up, blinding anger is representative of the Dragon breathing fire upon an enemy and should not be repressed. 9. There is no heaven or hell unless you make your life of one! We worship life and laugh in the face of death, all member of our order have previously died and have been reborn unto the splender that is life. You will find more information on this in Chapter II. 10. Good and Evil, right and wrong are solely perceptions of Christian thinking and are in fact a Christian invention. We have no, nor do we wish to have a concept of good or evil for to do so would be to acknowledge Christianity as a whole. 11. One must strive to be great in all things (s)he does, giving little energy or effort towards a goal is to not even acknowledge the facet of will. Will is the driving force behind magick and without an iron will one cannot be a magickian. Work hard towards your goals, selfishly devoting as much time as you can towards total achievement of them. 12. Test yourself constantly for weakness for only than can one overcome them. Once all weaknesses are gone begin testing your own strengths and attempt to strengthen them as well. 13. Fear is another tool of the strong, make yourself as a Satan to your enemies only than will you be free of them. Keep your workings hidden and obscure to others or they will cheapen your tradition and teachings. By keeping your true self hidden from others, you keep an air of mystery about yourself, what people don’t understand they fear! 14. Work always at becoming a warrior, forge for yourself a warrior’s credo and stick to it. Study a form of hand to hand combat as well as weapon combat for a minimum of at least one-year. Magick is the other form of combat one must have a crede about. To study various forms of combat is to gain self-respect, self-discipline and a sence of security in your own abilities. 15. Others deities are tools towards various workings of the self, when given enough energy from the magickians will and the aether these egrigor and phantasmata may take on an almost sentient being all their own. Through magick even mythical beings and deities may be used, evoked, invoked and the like. 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Third of the Scrolls of Ain – The Scroll of the Blue Ange l of Ain by Rev. Frederick Na gash 1. Lesser magick is th e manipulation of certain universal laws or properties to focus energy(ies) upon the Magickians' will to change something in the natural world. The will is th e prime and only factor in whether magick works or not! 2. Everything in this world is a manifestation of our own will, wh ether it is fo r better or worse, we are solely responsible. 3. Knowing that we control our own destiny, leads to control of the self, which leads to control of the will, wh ich leads to control of the natural world. 4. To use the will to alter the natural world you must utilize magickal practice. Through magick, the mind, body and \"Divine Spark\" become as one. 5. At birth you perform your first a ct of magick, you show the will to live. Any and every willfu l act, is a magickal one! 6. Through magick one will achieve: · Self-Realization · Self-Actualization · Self-Creation · And eventually Self-Deification. 7. Of all creatures on the earth, we are graced with what I call \"The Divine Spark\" and what others call a \"Soul\". Having the divine spark is wh at separates man from the other animals on the earth. 8. Both men and women share in this divine spark, it is u niversal. To acknowledge the magickal self is for the first time , feel the soul/divine spark. 9. The divine spark works as the fuel for the will to perform the magick. All o f the magickians' energies, whether they be magickal energies or what have you, they are fueled also by the spark. Lesser magickal workings require very little energy and that's the reason why most magickians have never experienced the spark, as most never really move past lesser workings. Greater workings have a much deeper power radiating directly fro m the divine spark, hence why it causes such great change The Fourth of the Scrolls of Ain - Good a nd Ev il (The farce extreme) by Rev. Frederick Na gash 1. Good and Evil are perceptions, not definite realities as reality is a lso solely a perception. Magick has nothing to do with \"Good\" and \"Evil\" and those who would say otherwise, say so because of their own faulty egotism and self-righteousness. 2. Egotism is th e true evil! For one to find true inner peace, false egotism mu st be eradicated from the self. 3. Prayer and Worship are not facets of true spirituality. Go d is formless and mindless, and it is th ose whom worship him who dishonor him and are evil. We do not worship what others think is Go d, so they consider us \"evil\" and by their perception we are. However, for us to say yes, we are evil and dark, is to agree with their perception of God. 4. Good and Evil being perceptions and not truths, have no part in the lives of any real magickians. There is no truth! The Fifth of the Scrolls of Ain - The Duality of Huma nity by Rev. Frederick Na gash 1. The dual nature of all things lies in knowing the opposites of ones self. The Yin and Yang, the equal yet opposing force, the male and female, all of which are dualities. We all can rest assured in knowing that everything has an exact opposite. Fire and water, black and white all of which forms a certain balance between chaos and order, life and death. 2. The \"self\" is a mere shadow in form compared to the true \"selves\" that we are. Our duality lies in 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"our nature. Our very core of being is our duality. Th e great strength and iron will of the magickian is even of dual nature. We deny no facet of our selves and are therefore, open to learn life's myste ries. 3. Human nature can be broken down into four sections: Social, Instinctual, Taught and Carnal. The \"social\" nature of man is his identifying marker of where he lives. A person from the city wo uld react different socially to a cow giving birth than someone from the country. 4. The \"instinctual\" nature of man is that which is not taught but \"willed\" and known without knowing. All four facets of mans nature can be forged into one duality. Th e social and taught can be combined to form what I call artificial behavior (S+T=AB). Th e instinctual and carnal can be combined to form infinite possibilities (I+C=IP). 5. The duality can now be combined to form infinite, metamorphic possibility. Be ing able to define and change these possibilities in our nature makes it easy for us to adapt and become anything at any time (EXTREMEL Y USEFUL IN MAGICK). 6. Metamorphosis is th e highest magickal tool any \"would be\" magickian could ever utilize, as through metamorphosis one can use and know all magick for they can become the magick! The Sixth of the Scrolls of Ain - Mud Re ligions by Rev. Frederick Na gash 1. The mud-religions include, in no order: Muslim (All fo rms), Ch ristianity, Wicca and Jewry. By mu ds, I mean of spiritual and intellectual depravity they want you to see their gods' infinite love or DIE! 2. Even if man has the divine spark, it does not mean they are all ready for god-hood. A god is a creature of infinite manifestation. Most of the muds I have met could hardly find Waldo. Our natural world is of jesters and fools; yet, our children are forced to idolize incompetence. What will be of a world run by those who cannot control their urges and will, are to lead us onward? I believe in my utopia! 3. They cannot sustain themselves or their own realities. They need help to simply exist in the world in which we thrive. They feed on their own people. They rob from their own family and attack of their own supposed beloved. For they know no love, they know not the feeling of a gentle touch and the words of a tender love, or what these things can do for their kind. Love to them is attachment and a bond forged in material deeds and not the most intimate emotion and highest magickal working that it is to us. They give their love wholly to their God and therefore cannot share the joy of love fully with another. Their reality is vile , obscene, violent and utterly unintelligent. 4. Those of whom feel pity for these mud people are, of course, no better than the muds. We are strong! We are iron made flesh! We are the highest embodiment of life and infinite manifestation in all its forms. W e are gods and they are mongrels, beasts, and inept raunch from the bowels of an impure mud-religion. 5. To hell with those who have little in mind and little future to look forward to. Oh how they take up space in which I could roam! Oh how they take up air that I could breathe! They are a plague upon the strong and a parasite upon the earth our mother! We are dragons, we are wolves, they are merely sheep and maggots and the only cure to the parasitic problem is th rough the strongest pesticide there is, STRENGTH! The 11 Tenets of Ain by Rev. Frederick Na gash 1. Thou shall indulge in all things which bring you pleasure. 2. Thou shall feel no pity, nor be a marytr to the weak ones who cannot sustain themselves in reality. 3. Thou shall seek vengeance for vengeance is the rightful path of the strong. 4. Thou shall feel no guilt in anything you do, if you make a mistake feel no guilt for it, but learn from it, 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"so you don’t make that same mistake again. 5. Thou shall worry about the self first a nd foremost in your life. All others you love come after the self. 6. Thou shall worship life and shun death and anything that is considered harmful to your life should be eradicated. 7. Thou shall strive to serperate truth from lies and try always to seek out new experience. 8. Thou shall accept no concept of Heaven and Hell, we are living in Hell and only we can make a Heaven out of it for ourselves. 9. Thou shall feel pride in all things you do and in what you are. 10. Thou shall use greed to motivate you towards achievement. 11. Thou shall acknowledge no sins, sins are a facet of our carnal self and are embedded in our nature. Sins are natural impulses that lead to pleasure, pleasure being our iron willed goal. Other Aspects of Ainism by Rev. Frederick Na gash Ainists are also magickians, we study Ainic Draconian magick as well as Ainic vampirism. Ou r magick comes from with in us and from with in the aethyrs. Ain ic Draconian magick is a form of both Lesser and Greater magicks wh ich use various methods to change the Aspirant into a greater being or dragon. Ainic Vampirism in corperates a lot of the teachings of Ainic Draconian magick yet delves deeper into various states of being. The prime focuses of Ainic Vampiric stu dy are in no order: 1. Immortality 2. Mental control over others 3. Lycanthropy 4. Draining vital life force from others 5. Zap magick or instant use magick 6. Invisibility Once one has mastered both forms of Ainic magick they will have an absolute grasp of the total Ain. Magick is the main focal point of all in the O.A.D and of all whom are Ainists. A lot of people have inquired about magick and magickal practice of the O.A.D however they believe magick is nothing more than a bunch of garbled nonsense. The reason most believe this is because of the level of mystical mumbo jumbo most associate with magickal workings. Another reason most disregard magickal practice is due to the validity of most so called magickains proclaiming to have had contact with various godforms etc... Most who lay these claims are dabblers and are not really serious practioners of the magickal arts. Magick should closer resemble science than a bunch of kiddies lighting candles and saying a few words to conjure Satan to physical form. It’s because of these dabblers that most think magickal practice is linked to devil worship and the cult histeria had begun to begin with. Kids cutting the heads off of dogs and cats in the name of Satan, that is one of the magickal movements greatest enemies. Real magickians do not harm animals or people in ritual!!! I’ve received over 200 e-mails in the past five years of kiddies proclaiming themselves high magickians and claiming to have spoken to Satan at length etc..etc..etc... If they are good for anything it is a good laugh! Another misconception i’ve noticed is people not knowing magickal laws or how magick works and asking for “Get rich quick” rituals, these again fall under the dabbler category. Ainists are not dabblers nor do we have time for them! 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Who is an Ainis t? by Rev. Frederick Na gash You may be an Ainist! If yo u’ve identified with what is writte n in this sma ll tome you yourself may be an Ainist. However Ainism is n ot a game, this is ve ry real and not just for those whom identify but for those whom live it. Ainists come in all shapes and sizes, from all walks of life and from every country in the known world. There are no requirements for dressing or acting in any matter contrary to yourself. If yo u believe and live the Ainic philosophy as laid out in this book feel free to further your knowledge of Ainism via our official website at http://oad.cjb.net [no longer active] if you find you are an Ainist feel free to join the O.A.D. As a precautionary measure I have taken the liberty to trademark the following terms: Ain ist, Ain ism, Ordo Astrum Draconis, Ainic Draconian, Ainic Vampiric, Ain ic. Why you might ask, simp le I’ve seen multiple other philosophies and religions groups formed under the guise of Satanism and they were the furthest thing from Satanic. I don’t want everyone and their mother to begin proclaiming themselves “Ainic Masters” and starting faulty groups based upon perverted principles of Ainism. On ly members in good standing with the O.A.D ma y use any of the mentioned terms. Kutulu a nd Ma n: The Kutulu Princ iple by Rev. Frederick Na gash Mankind, the great micro cosm, ca pable of a million thoughts per second, yet, cannot consciously comprehend 99% of them. The subconscious mind works independently from the conscious mind. Fear, hate, pain, love etc... are all products of your subconscious. These we can semi-comprehend, however, cannot change without learning how to work with in the subconscious. Dreams are another product of the subconscious, hence, why even when remembered they cannot fully be explored or explained, only interpreted. One problem that arises in the subconscious mind is the fear of death. The fear of the unknown is what drives humans to latch onto religion. Religion offers a quick fix to this problem, however, anyone with half a brain would question their supposed unearthly paradise. Even with religion, death seems to frighten people subconsciously. Th is is because even the most religious don't fully believe in the conception of heaven. Heaven and hell solely exist in the mind. People back up their claims of this heavenly paradise with hundreds of near death experiences and those people claiming to have \"seen the light\". This heavenly light doesn't come from some otherworldly source, but, from the subconscious mind. At the point near death, the conscious mind shuts down, leaving the subconscious mind to show whatever the \"Near-Deather\" wants to see. No Xtian really believes (s)he is a bad person and they've been told throughout childhood their going to go to heaven and meet God, it's what they want to see and do. This is wh ere the ancient Sumerian demon Kutulu comes in. Kutulu literally means \"Man of the underworld\". This can directly tra nslate in what I call the \"Kutulu Principle\". I use the term Kutulu principle to explain this theory, as it is sa id Kutulu is dead but dreaming. It is kn own that at death, the mind shuts down. However, nothing is ever mentioned of the subconscious mind. Man at death is very much like Kutulu in the fact that man is dead, yet, subconsciously dreaming. In the course of human development, man experiences little in the way of new mental experience. Only through exploration of new experiences of the mind can one achieve the great change and control his subconscious mind and therefore, control death. So the O.A.D strive s towards new experiences and expressions of the mind. For one to control death, he must first ma ster life. For one to master life, they must first ma ster the Ain! The goal of this article is not to fully explain death as a mind set, but to help others experience life for the first time ! veni, vidi, vici - Ju lius Caesar What is the Ain: Q&A with Re v. Frederick Nagash 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"What is the Ain? Ain literally translates to self or the absolute self. Knowing the Ain, and working with it are prime components to the OAD ma gickal system. Eve rything revolves around the self, rather than having a basis in the material world. This may seem selfish to some, however, it is a ll a part of the great change and mental development needed to usher in the great aeon. How doe s one work with the Ain? Mentally, mo reover, through the subconscious we can manipulate the ain to become and do whatever we want it to be. Basically, if th ere is something someone doesn't like about oneself, like having a bad habit, they can literally destroy it. Th is comes about through knowing ones own weaknesses and strengths and learning not to fall into self deceit. Through these methods, one can literally do, become, or think up whatever they want to be at any given point in time. How doe s one come to know the ir weaknesses and strengths ? Weaknesses are a subconscious act. Kind of like being told something and without you realizing it, it has some form of effect on you. Weaknesses can be anything from false egotism to giving away love too freely. Stre ngth, also, from the subconscious, can be defined as anything which is emotionally, spiritually or mentally empowering, something that you know in your heart of hearts that you know you have some form of mastery over. Finding your strengths and weaknesses are as easy as finding out what you are afraid of or problems wh ich lead to bigger problems. An d to find your strengths, it is th e same, but in reverse. W h y i s w e a k n e s s a n d s t r e n g t h a s u b c o n s c i o u s a c t ? Weaknesses and strength stem from emotion. Emotion is a subconscious act. By finding your strengths and weaknesses, you can hardly conceive how to change them using the conscious mind. While using the subconscious mind, the change comes easily. You'll find that most weaknesses that you have are from a past experience that has hurt you emotionally. Just as things in the past have strengthened you emotionally.

The subconscious mind works on levels the functioning mind can not fathom. Through the subconscious mind, you're able to change almost anything about your self. While, the conscious mind can hardly remember dreams from the subconscious. The great change comes about when one can pinpoint the exact occurrence that changed them and gave them that weakness.

Hypnosis is a prime example of this. Certain forms of meditation, deprivation and reaching certain states of mental attunement allow you to access the mind on a subconscious level. This is what shamans have been doing for years, with sweat lodges, and one-pointedness, also referred to as Gnosis.
