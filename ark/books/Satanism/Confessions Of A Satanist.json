Its practitioners are from all walks of life. Although marginal types and those with predisposing personalities have always and will always be important to Satanism and its leaders' ends, they are merely tools. Their antinomian influence is now so pervasive as not to be readily noticed. \r \r Amongst the highest echelons some are politicians, medical doctors, high ranking police officers, lawyers, advertising gurus, decorated military men, media personalities, fashion models and social workers. Amongst the lowest (usually temporary) ranks are prostitutes, minor drug dealers and a number of High School students. Some operate from the mists. Their victims are drip-fed straight amnesia by an assortment of mind control measures and psychological torture tactics that would leave any normal person numb with the dawning apprehension that things are not as they seem - and they have not been for a long, long time. \r \r The most talented amongst them have lifestyles maintained on crime, but lacquered with a thin veneer of respectable professionalism and knowledge. \r David Icke Website http://www.davidicke.com Powered by Joomla!

Often their personalities have a force that distorts the contours both of judgement and of everyday perception. I cannot mention every name, but I will drop enough clues. The doctors refuse to say exactly how long I have but ... \r \r I became involved in the whole sordid business in the 1970's, a decade noted for little beyond sartorial bad taste and crushingly optimistic fatalism. The decade that began as a drug-crazed carry-over of the 1960's soon bequeathed androgynous glam-rock, the Watergate scandal and the shallow opportunism of 'Rollerball'. Science fictionism stalked the streets with a rejected furtiveness bred of cowering beneath the backdrop of the Cold War and dancing with the resurrected agonies of another Asian based imperialistic conflict. \r \r I fell through a crack in reality, having deliriously wandered amid the human wreckage and reached certain spiritual conclusions. In short, I do not know how I got there, but I know why. The 1970s were a dismal, incense-fuelled time that only those who lived through it can appreciate. The comprehensive dismissal of values and the adoption of pornography as the aesthetic standard by which all endeavour was to be categorised left its impressionistic fingerprints on everybody's imagination, mine included. I guess that I analysed and reacted differently. That is how I escaped the mundane - through one of western society's fault lines. \r \r Credo quia absurdum! \r \r I began dabbling in the black arts as an alienated university student. It was 1971 when I attended my first meeting - only to be led into an existence of happiness, sexual excess, acquisitive arousal and comfort. Within a week of meeting my Luciferian mentor I was operating a number of travel businesses in Sydney and flying to international destinations at least four times a year. I had a Jaguar, city apartment, holiday home in the country, access to a yacht on Sydney harbour and women. I was young and considered to be an up and coming star within the shadowy twilight of the Satanic infrastructure. The nether world was at my patent leather-soled feet. My suits were hand-make Italian; the cravats and neckties, Chinese silk and my nymphomaniac maids, French. (They dressed like French maids and would often wake me with a lesbian show.) \r \r At that time the United States based Church of Satan was the very public face of a movement that had begun almost a century before and had culled its adherents from the renaissance of magic, which had begun in Germany and flowered in England since the dying years of the nineteenth century. The Church of Satan was one of the front organizations for an ancient body whose very existence had never before been imagined. If you want more information on some of its past and most influential members you could do worse than study the late J.P. Morgan, Drs. James McDonald and René Hardy, the Kennedy's (including Jackie), Irving Berlin, Groucho Marx, Elvis Presley, Garner Ted Armstrong, Sammy Davis Jr., Ronald Reagan, Edward Heath, Thomas Plantard de Saint-Claire or a search amongst the bushes. \r \r I learnt and reflected the glamour of the black arts: divination, dark meditation, sacrifice, sexual vampirism, talismans, voodoo dolls and sex magic. My life was one of calculated excess and dazzling fulfilment. I smoked handmade Partagas Cuban cigars. I had a personal secretary who was happy to engage my every whim and find like-minded others if I wanted a change or had a colleague I needed to impress. I finished every day with a restaurant meal, bottle of French Champagne and Black Mass orgy of unforgettable and unspeakable delight. \r \r David Icke Website http://www.davidicke.com Powered by Joomla!

The American Intelligence Services were still involved in funding the occult but their influence was more ingratiating than dictatorial. In any event, many of America's high ranking military men were members of various Satanic Lodges or kindred organizations. Often sensitive materials and powerful figures - who operated from the comfort, safety and anonymity of the dark velvet shadows - were transported on U.S. and Australian Navy ships. Oil tankers were another favourite. Materials (and indeed, people) have been concealed and lost on oil tankers for years. Remember, this was in the Seventies when America's organized crime syndicates were establishing the narcotics markets of the Western World, Australia included. \r \r I knew her as Lilith, a High Priestess of an ultra-secretive Black Order of Typhon. Hers was the easy smile of a true neurotic and the body of an Angel. Her long cruel fingernails were enamelled in the chic and expensive titillations of her victims and their fantasies. Urolagnists worshipped at her feet and obeyed her every sadistic command. They were not the only ones. Her clientele included the top-end of town and she frequented the boardrooms and bathrooms of power with an essence of mystery, wealth and alluring sluttiness that won her the attention and influence of very many. \r \r I had first met her at a stately home in an inner Sydney suburb at one of the regular Black Masses held to strengthen the bonds of lust, occult knowledge and perversion. There she was indulging the Devil's faithful, teaching and being videoed for the 1970's black-market that existed in underground extreme porn: bestiality, paedophilia, body wastes and pain. After her services \"to the Dark Lord\" she told me over a reefer and through exhaustion that she was only seventeen and had met the Master. He had given her a mission. \r \r Lilith was a child from one of Sydney's more self-conscious suburbs. Private school educated and with a future in her father's business, she sacrificed herself to help establish what is considered today, by those in the know, to be the most powerful and important Satanic organization in the world. That group comprises some of the most educated, wealthy, corrupt and corrupting people that have ever existed. And they operate out of Sydney, Australia - but their influence is international. \r \r It transpired that she had been flown to the United States to be tutored and initiated into what was at that time, Anton La Vey's underground Satanic sisterhood of professional women with an aptitude for carnality and a conscience to match: the Ordo Cave Lupam. Her high school teacher - an Adept in the Black Arts - had spotted Lilith while she was still only a schoolgirl. Like all Satanists, he believed that truth and salvation could be found through the exploration of repressed human needs; that pornography gave joy and joy gave strength. Through his dedication and perverse ability he had secured her co-operation to begin her new education for her assigned task of political intrigue and influential debasement. \r \r After completing her 'education' with the O.C.L. Lilith was tutored by an English gentleman who I knew as Pindar [I have highlighted this 'man' in several of my previous books]. I never met him but I worship the true father of the statutory heir. His were the 'Irish' mysteries of degradation and when his name was ever mentioned Lilith would often laughingly sing, '...the rosy red cheeks of the little children'. \r \r Lilith procured children to satiate the debased lusts of many Satanists. These were taken from single girls by promises, for a fee or occasionally, simple stolen. Babies were bred for their various purposes by 'Broodmares' - young unemployed girls who were paid to hand over their 'produce'. Sometimes this magical pornography was filmed; sometimes children died. Once you have seen a young child crucified or a baby kicked to death you are and can never be the same again. The most disturbing aspect of the Black Masses held in Sydney was and remains the ease with which victims were and continue to be obtained and the lack of any effective interest by the police (although a number of Police Commissioners from various States were members of the Order). This is not to suggest that Satanists are simply perverts or child killers. David Icke Website http://www.davidicke.com Powered by Joomla!

Demons were evoked and dispatched; sigils made and sacrifice and the letting of blood encouraged. In this regard, many who bask in their own limited knowledge believe that Aleister Crowley is the father of modern manifestations of Satanism, but this is incorrect. Perhaps Crowley is the grandfather of modern left hand path groups, but their stepfather is Peter James Carroll, the founder of the Chaos Magick School. There are a number of reasons for this and the various Black Lodges within Australia have developed from their early twentieth century reliance upon recruiting from fringe Masonic groups, through High Magick in the nineteen twenties, Low Magick in the nineteen sixties and seventies to their current prospective candidates from amongst Chaos Magick practitioners (who are generally young, ambitious, enthusiastic, energetic and destined by their lifestyle choices to the shadowy world of Satanism). \r \r A number of up-market Escort agencies in Australia and elsewhere are operated by Black Magicians. Yet brothels and pornography comprise only a small financial part of the International Satanic Empire. Most of the money comes from drugs (the C.I.A.), sophisticated blackmail, money lending and currency trading. Satanists of the highest order are behind a number of wealthy Conservative, New Right Christian Churches and organizations in America. These are some of contemporary Satanism's best cash-flow enterprises (mostly indirectly) and allow mass indoctrination and networking. \r \r The aim of the Alpha Lodge remains illiteracy rates in the western world of at least sixty-six percent by 2010 and the destruction of at least seventy percent of the globe's population by the year 2030. All governments count on their sheeple to respond in typical infantile fashions, including unconsciously identifying with a more powerful force - even if it enslaves, brutalizes and humiliates them. Most Australians perform so badly in the role of adult that they rarely achieve complete satisfaction from this process. It is the weak who must tell you they are strong. In this regard, the infiltration of the United Nations by Satanists - which began in the 1970s - has paid off extremely well already, as has the career of Henry Kissinger. It was Henry Kissinger who preposed the use of fundamentalist Christianity to bring about war, firstly in the Middle East and then globally. In this he was aided by a number of American Presidents subsequent to Richard Millhouse Nixon handing over the reins to Gerald Ford - who was always one of ours! \r \r As the Headquarters of International Satanism is Sydney, Australia it is not surprising to learn that Norman Lindsay - a former Magus of the Order - is considered a Satanic Saint [Norman Lindsay (1879 - 1969) was a famous Australian artist and writer]. Indeed there are a number of flourishing secret shrines dedicated to him and his memory throughout Australia and the United Kingdom. Every Equinox there are human sacrifices dedicated to him and the subtle but perverted influence his painting and children's literature continues to have. (Similar shrines exist in America under Henry Kissinger's authority but he has altered both the structure and subtle ethos of the American Alpha Lodge Shrines.) It was Lindsay who taught that every political solution leads to more complex and involuted problems. \r \r He counselled that the public is not concerned with satanic manipulators but only with petty criminals and little issues which affect their insignificant lives directly. As the status quo is maintained by the masses, it gets heavier the deeper it sinks and the greater its fears. The people cannot succeed or achieve and so must sink deeper and hold on more strongly! The fact that for most people the days repeat endlessly until death relieves them speaks volumes about the (sub-) human condition! \r \r Kissinger refined Hitler's 'Terror Technique' into the more subtle and powerful 'Tension Technique': building tension in society and then finding a scapegoat. Dark Path adepts do this in insignificant ways until they have the power and ability to move and direct people to more gross and hideous behaviours. In Australia recently, the Business Activity Statement for taxation purposes and the 'immigration debate' have worked exceptionally well. The 'War on Terror' has also been of incalculable international influence (even more so than La Vey's Satanic Bible continues to be). The rhetorical façade for George's Presidency may be Christian, but the plan is otherwise!

This is true of all the capital cities of the combatant nations.) \r \r If you doubt the influence of Satanism in the modern world consider the following issues: According to the World Bank, Australia is the wealthiest (or second wealthiest, after South Africa) nation on Earth. No one knows the full extent of Australia's natural resources and yet the living standards of Australians is getting worse each year and while Australians are amongst the most highly taxed people in the world we are quickly heading towards third world nation status. Who owns and controls the Reserve Bank of Australia (hint, it is the same people who own the American Federal Reserve and the Bank of England)? \r \r Why do overseas-owned companies pay so little taxation in Australia and why does the Australian government (of whichever political persuasion) allow overseas mining conglomerates to rape our environment and give Australians back next to nothing in return? \r \r Why was fluoride put into Australia's water supply and why is it impossible to have it removed? \r \r Are you seeing a pattern here? \r \r Why is the media of the 'Free World' so heavily controlled and their shamefaced relationship to government so symbiotic? \r \r Why have the educational standards of the Western World been forced to 'dumb down' (a process accelerated in the 1980s by both Spielberg and Lucas at the instigation of the Australian Alpha Lodge)? \r \r Why has multiculturalism been foisted upon the 'First' World (with the exception of Japan)? \r \r And who was behind the September the 11th operation? \r \r Which country's 'Intelligence Agency' supplied the W.M.D. story which 'caused' the Iraq invasion? (Hint, it was not a Christian or Islamic nation) \r \r The fact is that Alpha Lodge politicians (or political advisors) appreciate that if they pretend to respect the rights of sheeple and fain interest in their concerns, even though most realise that this is a ruse, they will go along with the programmes and policies because it is the line of least resistance. The democratic process allows them to express some of their frustrations, reduces the pain of their pent up depression and aggression while ensuring that nothing changes. You can see the same Representative Democracy political system everywhere it has been implemented. David Icke Website http://www.davidicke.com Powered by Joomla!

It is only a matter of waiting for the media to generate the slogan that 'the government should do something' and the governments - everywhere and of all political persuasions - always will. \r \r Australian Satanists have always been at the forefront of high quality videos and D.V.D.s devoted to 'kiddie-porn'. Sheeple are such that although they scream about the importance of 'justice', it is of no interest unless they are in some way harmed! Their morality is that of the herd, for the more that sheeple feel isolated yet together, the easier it is for Satanists to reign. Provide the subjects with the forbidden and they feel fragmented, weak, guilty and often worthless - all of which the Master Satanist employs for their own ends. In Australian produced paedophile entertainment certain Avon guard features predominate: sexual frenzy, degrading treatment, filth, coprophilia [getting turned on by shit], torture, rape and death. \r \r All of this is carefully crafted and augmented by aphrodisiacs and violence. Often the women involved are far worse than the men - little boys agonised by the cruel fingers, long tapered fingernails, teeth, cigarettes and perversions of ravishingly beautiful and debased female practitioners who are without restraint and have been maddened with heartless pride. Genital torture and castration are a constant theme. I will never forget the heartfelt sobs, desperate pleas, blood, tears and screams induced in many little boys by the agonizing use of alligator-clips, the application of the strap, whip, dildo, knee and the torment of electric shock! \r \r Often Satanists advertise in free youth culture Street newspapers. This provides them with a constant supply of young teenage hopefuls to recruit or exploit (or both). Often Street-kids are taken in, used and discarded. It is only another missing teenager! Coffee shops, city entertainment complexes and even evangelical youth based churches are still used to this day to lure the innocent and not so innocent, their hearts full of broken dreams from broken homes. (Thank you Lionel.)\r Often members who have reached a certain Grade, whose task and Ordeal it is to establish and maintain Outer Temple Teaching Orders as a recruiting ground for the Traditional Satanic Lodges, do so with dazzling results. Candidates are accepted and accessed over the required time for character, imagination and intellect - in that order. \r \r Debauchery as a science is taught and maintained by programmes - strict in nature and observance. \r \r Rituals are conducted, thought-patterns established, relationships destroyed and dependencies enhanced. Psychopaths are studied and emulated. \r \r Some of the deadliest, most effective and disarming assassins are women. Within the Alpha Lodges they are worshipped as embodiments of the Dark Goddess - who is known by many names and is virgin still!

A number of the President's men in Australia were quietly celebrating as the clock struck midnight on the 11th of November 1975. Both Intelligence Agencies had relations which were still trespassed by the ghost of Dr. Ward. Both reacted to these events because of Australian Satanism, in the first case because H.R.H. Queen Elizabeth II would be saved embarrassments and in the second because Gough Whitlam was not one of them. On this point I am in no doubt, Sir John did his duty to the Princess and Inner Head of the Alpha Lodge Australasia.

The same could not be said for Harold and his parties and the fact that people were noticing and indeed, Sir William was invited. \r \r You have little if any idea of the history, connexions and the network of Australia's Sinister Lodges, the Temples within them or their adherents and puppets. Why are some politicians spectacularly successful and others dogged at every step? How was the New York based public relations firm paid by John for doing such a good job in the ... elections?

But then again, he liked to play around and a number of our special people were happy to accommodate him, for a price. He craved respect and understated admiration and received both from us for the efforts he expended. \r \r I left the Alpha Lodge - as best as one can - and tried to reclaim a more mundane if no less ingratiating lifestyle. I operated a media company publishing anti-Christian tractates, political pamphlets and pornographic videos, working for a number of organizations internationally. The extreme rightwing of Britain had recently been infiltrated by a very old and isolated left hand path tradition and this sinister development augured well for the Alpha Lodges (although today, David Myatt is considered more of a Prophet than a representative of the Hebdomadry Magickal System). \r \r (While the Order of Nine Angles pursues a more open approach in the United Kingdom and increasingly in the United States of America, in Australia we still work just out of view). \r \r The strength of International Satanism continued to increase as its oldest families continued to wither. In the real world, money gives power and those best placed to dictate the money market always win, yet their magnetism and glamour have faded and their futures are more tenuous than at any other time. Their collective days may be drawing to an end. Their most enduring legacies will be the power structures they created and the relationships facilitated. Their funding of diverse groups dedicated to the destruction of Christianity is a story never to be told! (Their most successful recent social campaign was the \"Please God, don't let the Priest rape me again!\" effort in the late 1980's to date and the promotion of 'Lilac Seminaries'.) \r \r Modern post-1980 Satanism is the result of some hard learned truths and well-practiced procedures. Everyone knows that we are becoming more obvious - there are decreasing reasons to hide. The World of High Fashion - always a glittering ephemeral chimera - became an overtly successful recruiting ground for 'sweet young things' with a daring and glamorous nature. Multi-Billionaires increasingly sought the spiritual comfort and insider information the Satanic Alpha- Lodges could provide. What most people do not realise is that Satanism is a ritually based practice and that this repetition has - over time - left strong impressions upon the Morphic Field! This reinforces security and comfort within the left hand paths true adherents! \r \r Politically, the libertarianism of Twain that permeated Satanism gave way to the realization that the sheeple do not want freedom.

Another group long ago bought the American Congress, so the Alpha Lodges concentrated on the Republican Party and this has paid some very high dividends. Currently the U.S. federal government dances to our tune (a couple of steps removed, if you know what I mean)! \r \r Within the left hand path, Satan is the Supreme Prince (the Hierarchy of Hell begins with The Prince). He is 'The Other', the bright Fire Giver and Illuminator! He is the only God who cares! Satanism is a spiritual Darwinian theory based on predation. Devoted Satanists dedicate themselves and their sex acts to their Dark Lord. Prayers are said, Chants intoned or Invocations recited all as the basis of obtaining the blessings of Hell. \r \r Unknown - if not always unsuspected - Infernal Temples exist in every major city throughout the world - Vatican City included! Every hour of every day and every night people are knowingly engaged in Satan's service. Human sacrifice - whether ritually and quicker or slowly and degradingly over time - is all harnessed to specific ends. \r \r Politicians are introduced by a carefully graded set if criteria and situations that enable them to accept that their victims will be, \"Our little secret\". Young children sexually molested and physically abused by politicians worldwide are quickly used as sacrifices. In Australia the bodies are hardly ever discovered, for Australia is still a wilderness. \r \r Overseas, cremation is the favoured method and although the Satanic Alpha Lodges of Australia have access to crematoria when needed, this is surprisingly rare. Believe it or not many bodies are 'dumped over the side' every week in a number of isolated bush land settings. \r \r The emerging set of Satanic leaders is young, savvy, competent and heartless. They are masters and mistresses of their emotions and their intellect. Many are involved in business, politics, the legal profession and the arts. They are affluent, mobile and stylish examples to the next generation and therefore to the next generation of Satanists that power is glory, lust is nobility and liberty is the highest ideal of the new world man and woman. They use debasement of their victims as a ritual of power to themselves and their Deities. Often their victims are made to suffer in any number of situations. All of them are dedicated 'to creating the new men and women of the future' and 'to surpassing the Old Ones'. \r \r Beginning in Sydney in the late 1980s was a now International Underground Sadomasochist society founded by Satanists. Victims are abused to death in grotesque rituals held in secluded chambers throughout the global metropolis and never-ending suburbs and bewildered housing estates. Although many who attend are unaware of anything except their ability to fulfil special needs and cultivated tastes, all of these gatherings are Satanic in nature and magickal in purpose. This dark, ultra-secretive society has been used to corrupt and destroy; to distil fear and ensure petrified silence! (Remember 'The Family' of South Australia?

Allow their children no real prospect of success, inhibit their natural drives - particularly their sex drives; limit their options, coarsen their choices and society (such as it still is) quickly falls apart into pre-determined categories. No families, just weak individuals free to do as they are told. Satan is a wonderful 'systems man'! \r \r Already there are rampantly individualistic spiritualities spreading throughout the world.

Her inviting, natural sexual aroma interplays with the civet incense and dancing candlelight. The congregation stands in silence as infant children re-enact the pornography they have been taught. Upon the Altar the young woman lays with gaping legs and delicate droplets of urine upon her pubic hair. As the children finish their pre-arranged aping pantomime of degradation, the chanting to the Dark Gods and Dark Goddesses begins. \r \r The Altar is always a human body - male, female, alert, drugged, alive or dead. In every case, the Altar is fresh and young. The mechanics of a High Satanic Black Mass are the same as in any theatre designed to re-open psychic gateways, inculcate dedication, glorify, rarefy and idealize spirituality. Only the aims differ. In Satanism, sodomy is preferred because of its magickal effects. The sacramental nature of Ezekiel 4:12-13, II Kings 18:27, Malachi 2:2-3 and Isaiah 16:11 are only fully understood by Satanists. Even abstinence from all forms of satisfying and normal sexual congress is used to enable the destruction and replacement of old beliefs and standards. Merely to sidestep conventionality still leaves the neophyte with a mass of prejudices, idiosyncrasies, identifications and preferences that give comfort and definition to the personality. By pushing wider the parameters of being and expanding ideas, Satanists experience the inherent transience and contingent nature of all things. The Black Mass - whether High Satanic or Low orgy - achieves this. \r \r Any form of bizarre sexual congress is explored and encouraged because atrophied tastes need stronger stimulation. Children, the elderly, the mentally retarded and desperate are used at satanic ceremonies throughout the world. The left hand path caters for all tastes and responds to all needs. In Australia and throughout what used to be the Soviet Union, Downs Syndrome pornography is an expanding market and an acquired taste. \r \r Approximately one new D.V.D. - like The Gangbang of Mary Mongoloid Series (1998-2001) or Downer Syndrome Follies I-II (2001-2003) - hits the underground market every couple of months.

With the reform and application of the mercantile system to the Western World the opportunities for well organized crime and well-placed puppets burgeoned! \"Brothels are built with bricks of religion; Prisons with bricks of law.\" \r \r By misunderstanding the nature of Satan and His spirituality the True Adherents are safe to openly declare their allegiance to the world - which they do! Why did so many of the important people appear to have had well-planned excuses - if not escape routes? Wheels within wheels! To every Temple a God! \r \r Since Norman Lindsay's time, the Alpha Lodges have maintained well-organized political affiliations. Senior 'public servants', career bureaucrats and the diplomatic service have been used to integrate the coming Satanic age - just ask Sir A.G. (Name removed)! Most people are more comfortable asserting their 'independence' than being correct, effective, well off or powerful. They believe, because they have no or very few facts and because their beliefs offer them comfort - mostly the comfort of moral superiority. They use logic, reason, history, law; indeed anything at all to help them follow their prejudices and fulfil their desires. \r \r Governments everywhere cater for those people who would rather live on their knees than die on their feet. Politicians did not invent the human condition; they only take advantage of it. The Satanic aristocracy sees the masses as tools; means by which the ends envisioned may be achieved - individual suffering is irrelevant. The ends are all that matter; the means are chosen based on totally utilitarian and logical decisions. Corruption is endemic but accepted. That Queen Elizabeth II is claiming ignorance of her own governments' laws while disdainfully hiding behind her advisors and masquerading her interests behind complex business structures apparently bothers no one. Although the secret 'selling off of the farm' in Australia was thorough it was not slow. People assist their governments to push them to the side of their own lives - Always have, always will! \r \r It's the War against Terror; it's the same everywhere. Yet everyone agrees that the streets of the world's major cities are more dangerous now than they were throughout the Second World War! But who cares? History is replete with stories that never get told. How many people know about General Douglas Macarthur's 40 pages Memorandum of Saturday the 20th of January 1945 to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt or the names and rank of the Port Arthur killers? And whatever did happen to the Frogmen of the 19th of December? \r \r Viable, truly spiritual Satanism is becoming more overt. This is because of those who went before. And as the schedule works itself, the Alpha Satanic Lodges are growing ever more public. I will not mention names, front-organizations or interests. The time is when these will announce themselves - just like Disneyland! We infiltrated then built the modern media, created porno-film empires, turned 'Snuff' into art and liberated young people. \r \r Ours is the obsession of the mystery of darkness! \r \r This is our age: The Age of Satanas! \r \r Internet sites full of the grossest vulgarity and operated out of Israel are mostly founded upon left hand path philosophies.

Provided their bellies are full, their minds empty and their time consumed with frivolous entertainment, Satanists are free to triumph. It took less than sixty years to turn the Western world from war heroes to poofters; from bold, adventurers to crybabies; from devoted couples to divorcees and although never afraid of work in the past, now everyone has a Doctor's Certificate. Chronic apathy bolstered by cynicism litters the economic cul-de-sacs of our society. Literacy is almost gone, television is almost irrelevant, public infrastructure is heritage protected and most are crushed by the foreboding knowledge that tomorrow is another day. \r \r The Wand must be bedaubed.( \r The Cup drained.( \r The Sword dazzling.( \r The Disc penetrated. \r \r With Fire the Tunnel is penetrated.( \r With thirst the Cup is dazzled.( \r With Air the Sword is drained.( \r With soil the Disc bedaubed. \r \r Within the temple in the temple( \r Find here the Mysteries of the mysteries( \r The back passage is the shortest way( \r Turn Water into wine. \r \r On the 21st of July 1913 Franz Kafka observed in his Diary, \"Don't despair, not even over the fact that you don't despair\". People exist as robots within a world of no win politics fortified by political structures that have either outgrown their usefulness or graphically and tragically proved their inherent inadequacies. By old religious traditions that subverted a message of denying Church by preaching the personal and interior nature of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the State and family by advocating a higher allegiance to individual conscience continue as unabashed as if nothing had happened at all. And in answer, nothing changes. Anton La Vey noted that, 'There is nothing inherently wrong with fascism, given the nature and needs of the average citizen ... Now it's not so much a case of avoiding fascism, but of replacing a screwed up, disjointed, fragmented and stupefying kind of fascism with one that is more sensible and truly progressive.' \r David Icke Website http://www.davidicke.com Powered by Joomla!

He also opined that the best street cleaner was a riot-gun and there are few that would quibble. Turning against themselves they live alone and vicariously with others. They have allowed themselves to become prisoners in our mythological penitentiaries amid the bright-lights and dark corridors of their cheap and nasty psyches. \r \r If viewed objectively, Satan does not need to buy souls. The crowds are drip-fed belief systems, pointless choices and hollow opportunities. From radios, televisions, print media, billboards and the accepted agenda of the day, they exist in a constant state of boredom. \r \r Fashion experts assist psychopaths in both politics and big business. Words as empty as the hearts that speak them, hardly affect the masses any more. They exist in a universe of suspicion. Their jobs are tenuous; their comatose lives as artificial as their prejudices and their alienated futures mostly short-term. \r \r Its not that the true nature of what has and is being offered has changed or wasn't obvious all along. Just get another beer, turn down the lights, heat your packaged dinner and watch the flat-screen colour and movement of compliant simplicities. Your parents 'could not think of a number so they gave you a name.' But the State has assigned you a number for your pettiness and you will work until you drop! Samuel Adams said it best at the Philadelphia State House on the 1st of August 1776, \"If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.\" Nobody listened then either, except initiates of the precursor to the (Satanic) Alpha Lodges. \r \r We believe in the law of the Aeon, which is sacrifice and in the letting of blood. It's the only doctrine to which the masses have ever been faithful, that and the aesthetic of disgrace. A disguised post-modern Satanic Eugenics rests on the superiority of those who know that they are above 'the herd', which they view with revulsion and is reflected in the indignation of their policies for any form of commitment to anything wider than themselves - to the point of trivializing life itself. One wing of the Hospital helps infertile couples; the other unit terminates foetuses. Cloning is not required - as a trip around any Metropolis will prove. The condition of admission is an old school tie, a proper handshake, mobile phone, a credit rating and some proof from the government that you exist. \r \r The herd continues a hallowed tradition of pious fear - both of life and death. They light candles but they never really kiss. It is not hard to find them refracted through the stained glass grotesque caricatures of spirituality, the sound-byte vomit of politics, the mathematical facelessness of plastic statistics or in the quietest moment of the night. \r \r Their politics rest on tribalism, their social systems resemble a clique of High School Prefects not an open system where a vote actually means something. Next time you are standing in a queue imagine a world where the government operates everything; where Committee delegates organise everything; where the information is edited, cutting through the lines of least persistence and where equality of outcome ensures the finality of its long-term results. It's not that hard. We continue to organize it!
