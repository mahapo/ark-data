We look to the True Creator of the religion now known as “Satanism” and the Creator is Satan, himself. For far too long, enemies and outsiders have been free to define Satan and Satanism to fit their own agendas. Satan has rarely ever been allowed to speak for himself and reveal who he really is and what he is really about. Satan is a real being. He has interacted with many over the past several thousand years and he has left us his doctrines of the Al Jilwah, the Qu'ret Al Yezid and other manuscripts. He is the original Horned God. Satan does not in any way fit the Judeo/Christian or Muslim descriptions that have falsely defined him for so long, nor does he conform to the character depicted of him in Anton LaVey’s “Satanic Bible.” In order to really know Satan, one must go to him personally, without prejudice or expectations. One will find he does not conform to this or that denomination’s conceptions of “evil” which have been foolishly and thoughtlessly heaped upon him for centuries. Unfortunately, looking for answers from outside sources has been a common theme in Satanism because so much knowledge has been systematically removed and destroyed by the Christian Church. The Christian Church invented a false history to conform to their agenda, which is keeping spiritual knowledge and power in the hands of a few to the detriment of humanity. Some of the articles on this website are obsolete in light of more knowledge. Satanism is knowledge and I am endlessly involved in further research and study to uncover ancient knowledge that has been suppressed. I do my best to update this website whenever my time permits. Joy of Satan Ministries does not acknowledge or recognize Judaism, Christianity, or Islam as legitimate religions. These are in fact programs to replace spiritual knowledge with lies and corruptions, while extorting trillions upon trillions of dollars, and psychic energy, along with exploiting human misery and suffering to keep untold wealth, and spiritual knowledge and power in the hands of a \"chosen\" few. Judaism and Christianity are also extremely new, though they try to claim otherwise, with the latest major “religion” being Islam, which manifested itself less than 1,000 years ago. We find these programs have their foundations built upon stolen, corrupted teachings and practices of the older religions and have nothing of their own. We take the same stance where “Wicca” and “Neo-Paganism” are concerned as well. Both of these are latecomers (both manifesting in the 20th century) and are corrupted versions of the original religions, that conform to the Judeo/Christian agenda of enslaving the world through the removal of true spirituality. Our objectives are to enlighten people to the truth and expose all of the lies these recent so-called \"religions\" have created regarding Satan, Satanism, and Satanists. We do not recognize or acknowledge groups who characterize Satan or Satanism by Judeo/Christian concepts, or those, who like the late Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan members, do not acknowledge his existence as a real being. The information on this site is the result of much research and the personal interaction of many disciples with Satan and his Demons who have guided us and instructed us as to the truth concerning the origins of real Satanism. We encourage you to read and study freely and with an open mind. Only when one’s mind is completely free and deprogrammed, can true enlightenment and learning come about. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Satan 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"For too long, so many lies and so much misinformation have been spread about Satan. Many of us have seen him, have conversed with him, and have even been astrally touched by him. Nearly all of us who know him agree concerning his appearance. RHP religions have for far too long, written the book on how they believe him to appear, how they believe Demons to look and these are nothing but blasphemous lies. He is not red with horns and a tail, nor does he look like a Halloween monster. He does not have flaming red eyes or rubbery wings. These depictions are intended to insult, denigrate, and blaspheme him. (There are some lower orders of Demons. They are protectors and messengers who serve the higher-ranking Demons). Here are images of how Satan appears to those of us who have seen him. Contrary to Satanism being labeled as \"darkness,\" Satan appears wearing a long white robe identical to what he is shown wearing in the images below. Many of us see him often and have a very close relationship with him. He is beautiful. His appearance is almost exactly like in the pictures, other than he rarely appears with wings. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Many people have asked what Father Satan's Sigils look like: 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" • His Day is Monday. • His Colors are Blue, Red and Black He is the Sumerian God EA, also known as ENKI which means \"Lord of the Earth.\" He is also known as Melek Ta'us. • Animals that are sacred to him are the Peacock, the Serpent, the Goat, the Dragon and the Raven. • His numbers are 2 and 11 and 4. (666 is symbolic of the Age of Aquarius when he will rule again). • His Zodiac Signs are Aquarius, the Water Bearer and Capricorn, the Goat. • His Planets are Uranus and Venus (the Morning Star). • His Directions are both South and East • His most Important Day of the year is December 23, when the Sun is one degree into Capricorn. Capricorn is the 10th sign of the zodiac and the first degree of this sign makes eleven.

We are aware of the existence of Satan/Lucifer as an actual being. We are not atheists! In spite of major discrepancies, the Church of Satan, founded 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, presently takes an atheistic stance as far as external deities are concerned, and views Satan as only an “archetype.” In light of new knowledge based upon hundreds of hours of intense and in-depth research, we have discovered the following: 1. Satan is our True Creator God. \"YHVH\" otherwise known as \"Jehova\" by the deluded, is a false entity. \"YHVH\" stands for the four elements and corners in the popular Jewish systems of magick that are available to the public. 2. The character \"Jesus Christ\" is fictitious and was stolen from some 18+ Pagan legends of a God hanging from a tree, such as Odin, then being resurrected, and is another description of the alchemical operation of transforming the soul- death and then resurrection. The nazarene is and has never been anything more than a tool to remove all true spiritual knowledge and disarm the populace of their spiritual powers. Humanity has paid to the tune of trillions upon trillions of dollars, and with sickness, misery, and suffering due to the removal of this knowledge. Spiritual knowledge was systematically destroyed, twisted, and corrupted to SPIRITUALLY AND FINANCIALLY ENSLAVE US ALL. By force-feeding the populace that the Nazarene is a real entity, those at the top have maintained control and have reaped untold wealth and power. 3. True Satanism preceded Christianity by thousands of years and is based upon total transformation of the soul. Christians are deluded into \"accepting Jesus Christ\" and \"living saved\" which is all false. Everything in the Christian religion is false and we prove this beyond all doubts. The Christian \"saved\" hoax is based upon stolen and corrupted knowledge of alchemy, where one truly works spiritually to transform one's soul into godhead. Many Traditional Satanists worship Satan/Lucifer. Some acknowledge him as a friend and do not worship. We respect individuality and personal choices. One's relationship with Satan/Lucifer is up to the individual, as Satanism values free thought and individuality. Satan is the bringer of knowledge. The goal of Spiritual Satanism is to apply this knowledge and transform our souls into godhead, as was originally intended by our Creator God Satan. Unlike most religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages one to question everything. Being one's personal best and exceeding limitations are the essence of Spiritual Satanism and this begins with using one's brains to their maximum potential. Spiritual Satanism does not in any way conflict with science. We strongly encourage and support all scientific knowledge and enquiry. We are well aware humanity is dangerously behind in scientific knowledge and understanding due to centuries of oppression by Christianity. We believe that all spiritual and paranormal phenomena can be scientifically explained in a rational manner; scientific knowledge has not yet progressed far enough to comprehend or explain much of the so-called \"supernatural.\" There are no mediators in Spiritual Satanism. We strongly encourage our people to interact one on one with Satan. The ministry is here for guidance and support only. One's relationship with Satan is between that individual and Satan. We take the stance of \"responsibility to the responsible.\" We place no limitations on knowledge or personal power and do everything we can to make all knowledge available to EVERYONE- not just a select few who are a self-appointed \"elite\" as with other religions. Satan encourages self-study, learning, direct experience. Most Spiritual Satanists make a commitment to Satan. The commitment is very important because Satan protects us as we work to advance our powers. Those who go it alone or without any spiritual 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"protection often meet with disaster. Once one makes a commitment, Demons often guide us and work with us to help us advance. Unlike right hand path religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages action. Satan wants his people to live life to the fullest and to evolve. Satan is always there for us, but as we progress, he expects us to handle things, as we are able to, for ourselves, using our own powers. Christianity and its cohorts deliberately make cripples out of people. Christians forever rave about how their Nazarene has healed people. These people remain as slaves because they are never taught how to, nor are they required to heal themselves or others. The Nazarene archetype stands for slavery, servitude, and enduring endless abuse in order to program humanity to be the perfect slaves in a new world order. The Nazarene places total emphasis on the \"afterlife\" in order to create the mindset that the life we are now living does not matter. This frame of mind is essential for enduring all kinds of abuse for the benefit of a few. \"It has served us well, this myth of Christ\" -Pope Leo X (1475-1521) As for the so-called \"miracles\" connected with Christianity, any healings have been very few and far in- between. These are also based upon allegories related to transforming one's soul. Any human being with spiritual knowledge and power can accomplish all of the feats attributed to the nazarene in the bible, and more. Most Christians are unaware that they are dealing with nefarious aliens (enemy Nordics also known as \"angels\" and greys), who put up a show every now and then to give credibility to the lie. With the New Age practitioners, many call upon angels for assistance and learn nothing. The same theme of human ignorance and powerlessness prevails. Satan/Lucifer is the True Creator God of, and the great liberator of humanity. He does not fear humans having spiritual power and knowledge because he is truthful and has nothing to hide. Satan gives us the knowledge to become independent and free. He directs us to be masters of our own lives and destinies. Satan and his Demons are always there to help us when there are things we cannot yet handle. Satan keeps his promises; he is consistent and loving with his own. Satan stands for freedom, strength, power, and justice. Satan shows us it is NOT OK for us to take abuse. He shows us that we are deserving of pleasure, happiness and a better life. He created us through genetic engineering, the same as scientists are now creating clones and working with genetics, but only on a much more advanced level. Many people disregard so-called “occult” power, they do not take it seriously or are otherwise completely ignorant concerning it. The truth is, occult power has been in the hands of a few for centuries. Christianity has been their tool for removing this knowledge from the populace. Following the removal of knowledge, a fictitious past was invented to keep people from knowing the truth. People who do not understand or are unfamiliar with these skills are at the mercy of those who have them and who are adept at using them. Thousands of years ago in Ancient Egypt, this power was well known and most of the populace knew how to use it. With the arrival of Judeo/Christianity and Islam, knowledge was systematically destroyed wherever it was found. Cities, libraries, and any other sources of knowledge were destroyed in an attempt to annihilate all knowledge of the Original Gods [who are extraterrestrials] and the powers of the human soul. The Gods who interacted with, intermarried or befriended humanity were cursed and banished. Humanity has been cut off from our True Creator God Satan and has devolved ever since. The abuse of children, animals, careless destruction and disregard for the environment, the earth, and other living creatures are some of the effects of spiritual degeneration. Thousands of years ago, long before the coming of Judeo/Christianity, humans lived side by side with the Gods in the era known as \"The 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Golden Age.\" Satan is the Sumerian God known as \"EA\" or \"ENKI.\" He is a GOD, not an angel! He has been denigrated and slandered through the centuries with falsehoods and lies. Most people do not know Satan. They believe everything they are told about him without question. Fear is a powerful tool that has been used for centuries to keep humanity away from Satan. Satan is the most brilliant and powerful of the Gods. He is symbolized by the Water Bearer of the sign of Aquarius, the 11th sign of the Zodiac. Aquarius is the sign of humanity, technology and genius. One of Satan's numbers is 11. Satan/Enki established the Ancient Egyptian Order of the Serpent, also known as \"The Brotherhood of the Snake.\" Through the millennia, the teachings have been corrupted and no longer resemble the original doctrines. This Order was to bring humanity godly knowledge and power and to complete the Great Work of transforming our souls. This knowledge has been kept in the hands of a few and abused to the detriment of us all under the direction of the enemy gods. People are told if they are given this power, they will abuse it. This is another lie created and spread by those who deliberately use these powers for nefarious ends under the direction of the enemy extraterrestrials masquerading as “jehova” and company. To reveal these well-kept secrets to the average person would assure that those in control would no longer retain their power. The Gods are an extra-terrestrial humanoid race of beings. In the Christian bible, they are referred to as the \"Nephilim.\" These beings are very evolved, highly advanced, and immensely knowledgable and powerful. They genetically modified their DNA, so they do not age. In the Simon version of the Necronomicon (this book is based upon Mesopotamian/Sumerian mythology, even though classified as a work of fiction), the phrase: \"When the Great Bear hangs low in the sky\" refers to the constellation Ursa Major, part of the Big Dipper. When the planets align a certain way, it opens up a travel line for space travelers. People are always looking to the sky for when the Gods will return. Humanity’s sole purpose was for use as slave laborers in the mines for the Nephilim. We were to be destroyed after the gold mining project was completed. Satan, along with many of the Nephilim fathered children with human mothers. These offspring were known as \"Demi-Gods.\" Satan is incredibly strong, brilliant, and powerful. He refused to admit defeat. He lost a battle, but not the war. SATAN/LUCIFER STANDS FOR FREEDOM FROM TYRANNY! DOES SATAN REALLY EXIST? Yes. He interacts with his Disciples and followers. Many of us have seen him, we have witnessed the so-called supernatural, and we have been given abilities way beyond that of the average person. When we ask, we get answers. Unlike other religions, where followers have to go searching for their gods, Satan/Lucifer comes to us. He lets us know of his presence. Demons, as opposed to all of the Christian lies, are friends of humanity. Demons, who are the Original Gods, give us much individual attention and protection, once a strong and trusted relationship is established. When we are close to, and under the protection of Satan, he gives us good Demons to work with. Their Sigils contain very important designs of alchemical symbols related to the opening of the soul. Satan is not \"evil,\" nor is Satan responsible for the multitude of illnesses, diseases, or anything else that afflicts humanity. These afflictions are due to the removal and destruction of ancient knowledge that was replaced with the Christianity programs. Satanism stands for the balance of spirituality with technology. Without this balance, civilizations 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"eventually collapse. “Hell” is not a burning lake of fire. Hell is not inside the Earth, as some foolish Christians claim in order to frighten people. The Christian concept of Hell is very ludicrous. Some of us, who are close to Satan, have seen “Hell.” We all seem to have had the same experiences. Some places in Hell are dark and illuminated by a blue light, and in other places, there is daylight. One of Lucifer's colors is blue and Demons often appear with a blue light. Blue is a very spiritual color. I saw people sitting around a table in a bar in Hell, playing cards. The room was smoke filled, these people, already being dead, could smoke to their hearts content. These people were in spirit form. Some visit the earth to help humans who are on the Left Hand Path. This is where Satan keeps his own people until we can reincarnate and evolve into godhead. \"Hell\" and the \"Lower world\" are also allegories for the three lower chakras; \"Hell\" representing the base chakra. The reason for this is the fiery kundalini serpent lies coiled beneath the base chakra and when roused, it can be scorching hot. As opposed to hysterical Christian claims, Satanism is not in any way about blood sacrifice. All kinds of murder and living blood sacrifices can be seen all throughout the Judeo/Christian bible. The serpent/ snake, which symbolizes Satan, represents the kundalini at the base of the spine, also the DNA. The serpent represents life. When this force is activated, we are healed and enlightened. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Satanism for Newbies 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Spiritual Satanism for New People If you are new to Satanism, we encourage you to read everything on this website. Some of the articles are outdated. We are working on revising these, but most of the information is self-explanitory. Membership in the Joy of Satan is open and free. Thanks to donations, we are able to make knowledge openly and freely available while we do research. We keep everyone posted as to new knowledge and material. Once you have studied this book, if you are serious about wanting to make a commitment to Satan, this will be your initiation to Spiritual Satanism. After you have performed your commitment ritual, you should begin a power meditation program. Power meditation is the foundation of Spiritual Satanism. You will find help in the e-groups with any questions you may have concerning meditation experiences and such. Many brothers and sisters in Satan in the groups are knowledgable in these matters. Here are some answers to questions that frequently come up in the groups concerning Spiritual Satanism: 1. All consenting sex in Satanism is free- straight, gay, bi-sexual, group sex, etc. Your sex life is your own personal business. This also includes those who choose to remain sexually inactive, or who are a- sexual. Your sex life, however you choose to live it is your own business! 2. Recreational drug is your own business and your own judgement. Responsibility to the responsible. Spiritual Satanism advocates empowering the soul without the use of artificial stimulants or mind- altering substances, but this is up to the individual. 3. Satan does not demand slavish worship. He does not expect us to be \"sorry.\" Satan gives us knowledge and expects us to apply that knowledge in advancing our powers and our soul. Satan wants for us to grow, evolve and become independent. 4. Satanic prayer is sending energy. For example if a loved one is sick, we would send him/her healing energy. To commmunicate with Satan and his Demons, we do this telepathically. This sort of thing will come with power meditation and opening your mind. Satan DOES hear us when we communicate to him. 5. Weekly rituals are great for new people in opening the soul to Satanic energy which is very beautiful. 6. People coming here who were former Christians, need to read through Exposing Christianity. By reading through the articles, you will see the truth. The world has been indoctrinated and force-fed lies for centuries through Christianity and its cohorts. Christianity is a lie and nothing more than a program to remove spirituality. In coming to Satanism, you will find the spirit world and your soul are very real. Few have experienced real spirituality, empowering the soul and so forth, due to centuries of lies. Through learning and empowering oursleves, anxieties and fears are banished and we become strong in wisdom and knowledge. Most Satanists are spiritually confident and capable and do not fear the so-called \"supernatural\" or death. 7. If you are under-age and living in a Christian home, Satan understands. Do the best you can until you are of legal age and can practice your religion freely. Satan wants his people to be safe. Satan states in the Al-Jilwah: \"Do not mention my name nor my attributes, lest ye regret it; for ye do not know what those who are without may do.\" 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"For Those Who are New Unfortunately, the Christian Church has prevented much in the way of freedom of the press and free speech, especially for those of the left hand path over the years. Satanism is a major threat to many who wish to retain control and power as Satanism places this control and power in the hands of the common man/woman. Satanism has been deliberately suppressed and followers have been severely persecuted. Enemy religions have been free to promote their own lies and horror stories about Satanism to keep people away, using a lack of knowledge and fear. This has lead to much ignorance and confusion concerning Satanism and has had a most unfortunate effect on many who have had misunderstandings or no one to answer their questions when seeking the left hand path. Satanism is a VERY spiritually intense religion. For those of you who were raised in Christian homes, or were atheists, this intensity of spirituality can be surprising or even come as a shock. Other religions are spiritually dead; in other words, nothing happens, and on the rare occasion something does, it is of a weak nature. Most right hand path religions are based upon stolen and false practices. As opposed to Christians who pray and keep praying with no answers, Satanists get blatant answers and I don't mean twenty years later! Many of us have had similar experiences as Spiritual Satanists, but as we are all individuals, experiences will vary, and what one person may experience, another may not. For those who are new, here are some of the things you can expect: • Strange and frequent coincidences, usually of a positive nature. • Voices that may give you good advice or inform you of something you didn't know or something that will happen. • Vivid dreams, especially if you have been studying a lot about Demons. Usually these dreams aren't negative, just vivid and intense. Many things happening early on can be stimulating and exciting. Remember this is something new and can take some getting used to, as you are establishing strong, permanent spiritual relationships that will help you immeasurably. Now, at some point, usually when you are feeling somewhat confident, Satan will more than likely show you what is wrong with your life. Satan knows everything about us and where we are headed by our actions, lack of initiative or whatever the case may be. If we are doing something that will have a detrimental effect on our lives down the road, he will let us know, BLATANTLY. This can be bewildering and even downright frightening to some, especially with all the lies and false horror stories spread by the enemy for centuries. There is no cause for alarm. He is only getting onto you because he cares. Sometimes he will send a Demon to direct us, as he did with me and I am to this day, deeply grateful. The Demon might get strict or do whatever will get you to listen up and change. NEVER WILL SATAN OR HIS DEMONS TELL YOU TO DO ANYTHING HARMFUL OR DETRIMENTAL TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS! These kinds of experiences come from Christian angels and other entities that have nothing to do with Satan or any of the Demons. Always remain open. If you are having problems understanding something or are confused, you can ask Satan to help you and he will. Remember, ALWAYS show respect and reverence for Satan and our Demon friends and they will reward you with much wisdom and knowledge that outsiders will never 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"have. The so-called \"supernatural,\" is a part of our daily lives as Satanists. This is something positive. Satan will reward you with a sense of spiritual and inner strength that will pull you through anything. Psychic gifts begin to open to us more and more, along with confidence and deep understanding. In finishing, it is important to keep a strong positive attitude and don't listen to bullshit stories told by those who know nothing about Satan, or Satanism. Dark blessings and may your journey on the left- hand path be rich and rewarding. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Satanic Sacraments People have asked me why I advocate making a commitment to Satan. Making a commitment to Satan is a sacrament. It changes your life for the better and also opens a door to knowledge, wisdom, the spirit world and friendly communication with the Demons that is inaccessible to outsiders. Making a commitment shows one's intentions and dedication to Satan. This is where he takes us seriously. Unlike sacraments in other religions, Satanic sacraments are real and true. In other religions, the sacraments are false. This is proven by the fact that those who receive them can just walk out or \"backslide\" and leave at any time. They have no power or bond. They are in reality, worthless. When we make a commitment to Satan, he takes us and our word seriously. This is real and permanent as it should be. The initiation ritual also represents a test of character. Strength is so important. Our character is tested when we give our souls to Father. Here we take one of the most courageous steps of our lives. Many of us go up against everything we have been indoctrinated with throughout our lives with bold defiance. Here we show our true character, that we are not manipulated by fears, threats and things we truly do not understand. This is a huge spiritual step in liberation of the self and soul and prepares us for the intense inner growth and spiritual evolution that comes with being a true Satanist. This shows we are truly dedicated to Father and we mean what we say, as total honesty is extremely important to Satan and the Demons. In return, we are rewarded with knowledge and wisdom beyond anything known to outsiders. Also, when those of us make a commitment to serve as clergy, this is a serious lifetime appointment. Father takes us up on this. He frequently makes his presence known in the lives of his disciples even when we have our minds on something else. This is the way it should be. Father's relationship with us is a two way street. He meets us more than half way. Outsiders are known as \"those who are without.\" Many who have dabbled in the occult, magick and even Egypt; (as Egypt and all of the occult are of Father Satan) outsiders have had their share of negative experiences and hard luck as they have not made a commitment. I have found outsiders can only go so far in these areas. When we make a commitment, we become part of the Family of Satan and are welcomed to learn, grow and evolve. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Powers of the Mind and Soul The esssence of TRUE Satanism is completing our Creator God Satan's work upon humanity. Satan was prevented from finishing his work on humanity: that of the human soul into the godhead. The \"godhead\" is spiritual and physical perfection and immortality, along with godlike powers, wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. This is the underlying message of all of the legitimate occult disciplines, such as alchemy and the legends of the Gods which are all allegories containing this powerful message. At first mention for those who are inexperienced with witchcraft (using the powers of one's own mind and soul to obtain one's desires), images of old hags with pointed black hats, broomsticks, bats, cauldrons, frogs, toads, amulets, sacred stones, symbols, etc., pour forth in one's mind. The powers one uses are the powers of his/her own mind and soul, to begin with. The above mentioned, many are just useless props, such as a cauldron. Others, such as amulets, rings of stones and so forth amplify energy. Covens (groups of witches/warlocks) can be extremely powerful in amplifying energy, as many gifted people work together to apply these powers, many in the case of where one working alone could not accomplish certain workings. Raising energy and direction of that energy in obtaining desires, whatever they may be, is what witchcraft is all about. We often see circles along with astrological glyphs and other occult symbols in the movies and such. Astrological timing of raising and directing energy is often critical to the success of a working and greatly amplifies the powers. Witches and warlocks [mages](those who use the powers of their minds and souls and have this knowlege) use whatever means they can to amplify their powers. This is important. Demons and spiritual assistants often use frogs, toads and other animals called \"familiars\" to assist mages in their work, and communicate through the medium of an animal, which is always very well cared for and close to the mage; a powerful bond is formed. The familiar also offers protection and is a gift from Satan. Summary: 1. True Satanism is working to advance one's mind and soul and personal powers. 2. \"Witchcraft\" is using these powers, which are of the mind/soul. Symbols, amulets, stones and other props act to amplify the energy, either directly, or indirectly for those who prefer to use imagery to intensify their powers. 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Three Steps of Witchcraft This article is basically for new people or a getting back to basics. While there is no \"three-fold law,\" (Click here to read about The \"Three-fold Law of Return\" Exposing This Lie and its Origins) there are three basic STEPS to working magick. 1. You raise the energy 2. You program the energy 3. You direct the energy. When you begin directing the energy, you should continue to program it, while you visualize it doing what you want it to do. Let's begin with step one. First, you have to have energy to work with, the stronger, the better. The stronger your own energy, the more energy you will naturally be able to raise, direct, and handle. The more experienced you are, the easier this becomes. All of this is like working a muscle. The more you work with it, the stronger it becomes. For white magick (this is best to work with for newbies, black magick requires more experience and skill) you will more than likely want to use your own energy and connect with the working. Using Runes and vibration is one of the quickest and most powerful ways of raising energy. Other ways are using the foundation meditation or through just visualization. You raise the energy and should feel it strongly, throughout your entire body. With Step Two, you must program the energy. By \"program,\" I mean you must tell it what you want it to do. Energy all by itself is pretty much neutral and inert. With step two, you must use what are called \"affirmations.\" \"Affirmations\" are short, to the point phrases in the present tense that are repeated to program the energy. The present tense must be used because energy does not have the reasoning power to understand \"will happen.\" \"Will\" can be at any time. For example: You don't want to say \"_____ will come to me.\" Instead, you want to say \"________IS coming to me.\" Energy does not have the reasoning power as to *HOW* what you want is coming to you. Energy takes the path of least resistance, unless it is programmed. For example, many of you want more money. Don't just affirm \"Money is coming to me.\" This could manifest, if undirected, say on a job where you handle money, like a cashier for example, or through your paycheck, as usual. That is the easiest way. You have to further affirm: \"Large amounts of free and easy money are coming to me.\" \"This money is all mine to keep and spend as I wish.\" You also should affirm \"in a very positive and happy way for me.\" You don't want a loved one to die and leave you an inheritance or get the money in a way that would be unpleasant. So your affirmation would go something like this: \"Large amounts of free and easy money are coming to me, This money is all mine to keep and spend as I wish. This money is coming to me in a very positive and happy way for me.\" Affirmations should be repeated with intent, five to ten times or more, in your mind. You can also visualize energy as with step three, throughout the day and state your affirmations a few times to reinforce the working. ALWAYS REMEMBER: ENERGY TAKES THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE AND DOES NOT 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"HAVE THE ABILITY TO REASON. Another example is weight loss. You don't want to wind up getting seriously ill, as this is one of the easiest ways to drastically lose weight. Your mind can do it for you when properly programmed, for example affirm: \"I am losing weight in a very positive and healthy way for me.\" With step three, you direct the energy. You do this through visualization. Energy using white magick should be visualized as a white-gold light, shining brilliant like the Sun. You need to visualize this brilliant energy either around your entire self and/or around whatever it is that you want. Visualize in your mind whatever it is OCCURRING NOW and visualize the energy lighting it up. For example, with attracting money, you would want to visualize the money (your wallet full, or whatever), even *feel* and *smell* the money, touch it; the more realistic and the more astral senses you use, the more effective this will be, and infuse it with as much energy as you can, the more brilliant, the better, using your visualization. Feel happy emotions. For health, direct the energy to the afflicted organ, and visualize yourself as healthy and happy. Again, FEEL happy, while you are doing the working, as if it is already so. Now, forget about the working and try to think of other things. This can be difficult in desperate situations, but do the best you can, because worry and obsessing over a working can undo the energy you put into it. Just let it go and know it is working. The only exception to this is, I already went over in the above: You can also visualize energy as with step three, throughout the day and state your affirmations a few times to reinforce the working. Just don't obsess over it, as this is a lack of faith in your own power and can dilute the energy or ruin the working. This sort of thing takes practice like anything else. Now, for black magick, you do not want to come into contact with any negative energy you raise. Those who do not have knowledge do this sort of thing and suffer many times for it. The answer to everything is knowledge. Now, I am speaking from my own experience here. Most popular grimoires and such will tell you to use black energy. In my own experience, I have found grey energy to be the most devastating. Grey energy is also death energy. It causes illnesses and all sorts of negative things. For example, a death spell. I speak from experience here. Take the death energy from a cemetery or anywhere there is death and pull it out of the ground, using visualization. Program it, as in step two, for example, \"The grey death energy is killing_______.\" Do this while you are putting it on the individual you wish to do away with. I have also found through direct experience, this must be done many times on a regular basis. I also want to add, most popular writings will instruct you to raise as much emotion, such as anger and hatred as possible. Again, this is ok, but not necessary. What is necessary are the strength of your own soul, your will and directing the energy. On a lesser note, those who deliberately try to do you harm in your life, simply direct their own energy right back to them, using the grey tones. Sit back and watch them suffer and revel in it. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Ritual Tools for Those Who are New The ritual tools are representative of the 4 elements; fire, earth, air and water. The ATHAME or \"ritual dagger;\" \"black handled ritual knife\" is used to point at the 4 directions and invoke the 4 crown princes of Hell. It is used to direct energy and the will. It is associated with the element of AIR. It symbolizes the male energies of the rite. The BELL is used to signal the beginning and end of the ritual. The ringing of the Bell clears the air in preparation for ritual. It is rung in opening by turning widdershins (counter-clockwise) and at the end of ritual by turning deosil (clockwise). BOOK OF SHADOWS aka SPELLBOOK aka GRIMIORE is your own private journal of ritual and magickal workings; their outcome, what you did and when and how you did it, spirit communications and manifestations. A private record you can keep and refer to recording all of your experiences in detail. The BURNING BOWL should be made of stainless steel or silver. It is of the element of FIRE and is used to burn papers that contain written prayers/requests during ritual. A seperate bowl is not necessary, but can be used to burn poppits, personal belongings or effigies of a hated on for use in destructive (Black) Magickal workings. I always keep seperate ritual items for Black Magickal workings. The reason for this is because when we practice Black Magick, we are using very negative and destructive energy. This energy can contaminate your every day ritual items. Black magickal tools are best kept seperate. In time, they will develop a powerful energy of their own. CANDLES are representative of the element of FIRE. Candles for standard ritual should be black, but if black is unavailable, blue or red can be used. When summoning Demons, it is important to use the color related to the Demon (see \"how to summon Demons\"). *Due to xtian control, places where black candles can be purchased are becoming scarce. Do the best you can- remember, what is in your heart and what your intentions are is more important thean the color of your candles. The INCENSE BURNER is used to perfume the air and to make for a favorable atmosphere for ritual and magickal workings. Incense is pleasing to Demons. One should always have a sample burning of new incense. This is because once a ritual has begun, it is too late if the incense is substandard. Cheap or foul smelling incense can be a major embarrassment and can also be insulting to the spirits one is trying to summon. The Incense Burner is both of the element of FIRE and the element of AIR. RITUAL CORDS are not necessary, but can be used in binding spells or with spells that require knot magick. 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CRYSTALS are not necessary, but can be used to intensify ritual and magickal workings and to store energy. The RITUAL CHALICE represents the element of WATER. It is used to drink wine or some other beverage during a formal ritual. It should be silver or stainless steel. It symbolizes the female energies of the rite. PENTAGRAMS are not necessary, but can be used to represent the element of EARTH. They should be of silver or stainless steel. *Everyone should have a BAPHOMET symbol somewhere on their altar. The WAND is a standard ritual tool used by mages and sorcerers of the Right Hand Path. I strongly discourage the use of a wand. It is also called a \"BLASTING ROD\" and for centuries has been used to abuse and exploit Demons in the name of the enemy god. This is not wise if one wishes to establish relationships with Demons as wands are very offensive to them. Wands are representative of the element of fire.

The Yezidi people originally came from Southern Iraq and migrated north to Mount Lalish. It is believed they are descendants of the Assyrians who sought refuge after the fall of Nineveh in 612 BCE. ¹ Eridu also known as “Enkidu” was an ancient city in Southern Iraq. This was Father Satan's (Enki’s) city. The valley of Baten El Ghoul which is right over the buried ancient city is now known as \"The Devil's Hole.\" \"Belly of the Beast.\" The Jordanians and many others consider it to be haunted. Demons have been seen by many who have spent the night there, mostly soldiers in bivouac (camps). Those who have been there for any length of time claim it has a powerful energy which RHP people label as \"evil.\" Those who have spent the night there also claim the entire area is \"bathed in a strange bluish grey light.\" \"Apparitions\" are also seen. (The above information was taken from the book \"Psychic Warrior\" by David Moorehouse). The author was a US Army soldier who was hit in the head by a mortar shell while camping with his platoon in that valley and experienced psychic phenomena and abilities he never had before the incident. He was eventually assigned to the US Army Psychic Warfare Dept. Iraq has many ancient artifacts and evidence of Satan. Mount Lalesh is near the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh and along a three hundred mile stretch are the Ziarahs; the Seven Towers of Satan with the center tower on Mount Lalesh. The \"Seven Towers or Power houses -a high white cone shaped structure with bright rays flashing from its pinnnacle.\"² Each tower is topped by a brilliant heliographic reflector, and was intended to serve as a power house from where a Satanic/Yezidi Priest could beam his will to influence events in the world. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" The Yezidis have often been described as a secretive people who are not permitted to reveal their religion to outsiders, they keep their real beliefs hidden. Modern Yezidism has changed somewhat from the old ways due to outside interference. The Yezidi people have been severely persecuted and are very suspicious of outsiders. It is obvious their doctrines have been altered to conform to xian beliefs as in the Qu’ret Al Yezid, Satan dictates he is a God and in other places it reads he is an “archangel.” Satan dictated the Al Jilwah directly to Yezidi prophet Sheik Adi in the 12th century. The Al Jilwah is the most important doctrine in Satanism and every Satanist should be familiar with its teachings. I asked Satan if the Al Jilwah was from him and he confirmed it was, but stated that the Muslims altered some of the Yezidi doctrines. The Yezidis have been victims of mass murder and genocide at the hands of others, mainly of those of the xian and muslim religions. In the year 1415 CE, Muslims desecrated and burned the tomb of Sheik Adi, ransacking his grave and removing his bones and burning them in front of the Yezidis. “Some of the Yezidi multitude they took as prisoners and made slaves of them, others they murdered. “Badr al- Din further ordered the execution of two hundred members of the sect and had Sheik Adi’s bones disinterred and burned.” ³ In 1892, Farik ‘Omar Pasa invited several Yezidi Chiefs to Mosul. His agenda was to collect 20 years back taxes and to try to convert them to Islam. A few xians were present at the meeting. He began to 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"tell them that “if they would give up their Devil-worship, they would be rewarded with high place and rank, and would please the great Allah.” When they refused to answer, Farik threw them into prison, marched on their village and “slew about 500 of them.” 4 Most Yezidis are illiterate and the few doctrines they have are passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. In order to avoid persecution, the Yezidi people have purposely deceived outsiders concerning their beliefs and doctrines. This explains why there are so many conflicting accounts of their faith. The Yezidis have very few scriptures; in the Al-Jilwah, Satan instructs: “I lead to the straight path without a book.” ”Melek Ta’us taught “first by oral tradition and secondly by this book Jilwe. ” 5 The Yezidi people are forbidden to say the name “Shaitan.” They refer to Satan as “Melek Ta’us.” Melek means “King.” He is known as the Peacock Angel because of his beauty and pride. He is the “Proud One” and “Ruler of the Earth.” He is a God of light rather than of darkness and is concerned with the destinies of the world. 4 The Yezidis represent Satan by both the peacock and the snake. “The peacock represents the beauty of the worshipped God and the snake represents his wisdom because he is both beautiful and wise.” Their holy relic is the copper sanjak, an image of the peacock. 6 They play the flute and tambourine at their festivals and dance; “a worship which led to every excess of debauchery and lust.” 7 ”The Jalwah and the Resh are the authentic holy scriptures of the Yezidis. The Yezidis not only acknowledge the loss of many copies of their scriptures but also Shaikh Hayder’s recording of the Book of Resh. The latter no doubt the Resh scripture was set down from memory.” The Yezidis indeed avoid mentioning the very name ‘Satan’ or any of his attributes; have kept themselves aloof for centuries and their books a mystery. They also are forbidden to wear the color blue as this is the sacred color of Satan. 8 The Yezidis sometimes use the name “Ankar” for Satan and the name Angar-Manyu for Ahriman in Zoroastrianism. 9 The Mishaf (Scripture) Resh (Black) the Yezidis believe was written by Shaikh Hasan al-Basri has been called “Black” because the word Satan is covered in it. Some believe it was the Quran with the words for Satan covered by wax. It measures 28 x 21 cm. and has a leather cover. The Yezidis also have a reputation for being adepts at black magick. 10 ¹ The Yezidis, their Life and Beliefs by Sami Said Ahmed 1975 ² Adventures in Arabia: Among the Bedouins, Druses, Whirling Dervishes & Yezidee Devil Worshipers by W.B.

There is no place in the universe that knows not my presence. I participate in all the affairs, which those who are without call evil because their nature is not such as they approve. Every age has its own manager, who directs affairs according to my decrees. This office is changeable from generation to generation, that the ruler of this world and his chiefs may discharge the duties of their respective offices everyone in his own turn. I allow everyone to follow the dictates of his own nature, but he that opposes me will regret it sorely. No god has a right to interfere in my affairs, and I have made it an imperative rule that everyone shall refrain from worshipping all gods. All of the books of those who are without are altered by them; and they have declined from them, although they were written by the prophets and the apostles. That there are interpolations is seen in the fact that each sect endeavors to prove that the others are wrong and to destroy their books. To me truth and falsehood are known. When temptation comes, I give my covenant to him that trusts in me. Moreover, I give council to the skilled directors, for I have appointed them for periods that are known to me. I remember necessary affairs and execute them in due time. I teach and guide those who follow my instruction.

I place my affairs in the hands of those whom I have tried and who are in accord with my desires. I appear in diverse manners to those who are faithful and under my command. I give and take away; I enrich and impoverish; I cause both happiness and misery. I do all this in keeping with the characteristics of each epoch. And none has a right to interfere with my management of affairs. Those who oppose me I afflict with disease; but my own shall not die like the sons of Adam that are without. None shall live in this world longer than the time set by me; and if I so desire, I send a person a second or third time into this world or into some other by the transmigration of souls.

Christianity has been at liberty to dictate without any opposition, what they CLAIM Satanism to be. In order to accomplish this, the truth had to be destroyed. The Catholic Church (the original Christian Church, from which all Christian sects have evolved), heinously tortured to death and mass-murdered millions of innocent men, women and children in what was known as \"The Inquisition.\" Some children who were burnt to death in what were known as \"witch houses\" were as young as two years of age.¹ Christians forever rant and rave concerning the \"one world order\" where all identities, cultures, personal privacies, and liberties will be lost and humanity, after being systematically bar-coded, will be lumped into a one-world slave state. What they fail to see is how their own so-called \"religion\" and bible have always been and are the roots of and blueprint for this regime. Everything in the Judeo/Christian Bible has been stolen and corrupted from religions predating Judaism, Christianity, and Islam from hundreds to thousands of years. Through Judaism and its tool of Christianity, all of the original spiritual teachings from around the world, (which are CONCEPTS) have been stolen from, lumped together into the \"one,\" and corrupted into Jewish archetypes and characters and fictitious places. This has given the Jewish people as a whole a false history, political power and \"spiritual\" authority to which they are not entitled. The bible is a very powerful subliminal tool to control the masses. One can see this is a man-made work as there are endless contradictions. The bible has been systematically drummed into the minds of the populace from a very early age. A lie must always be enforced as opposed to the truth which can stand on its own. Because spiritual knowledge and occult power have been removed and kept in the hands of a \"chosen\" few, the unknowing populace has been helpless against it. The agenda here is to create a one-world slave state with the \"chosen\" few ruling at the top. The perpetrators of course blame Satan to create a necessary distraction, while they use occult power to accomplish their ends. They have a history of stealing from and blaming their enemies for everything they really are and do, while always holding themselves in the highest esteem and innocence. The original religions now known as \"Satanism\" (by the way, \"Satan\" means \"enemy\" in Hebrew), were all based upon what is known as the \"Magnum Opus\" or Great Work. The one known as \"Satan\" is our True Creator God. He was prevented by the other Gods from finishing his work on humanity, that of the godhead. The godhead is physical and spiritual perfection. Now, if you continue to read on, I will 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"prove this. The serpent is seen everywhere in ancient relics and structures. The serpent was held sacred in all areas of the ancient world. Satan is the God Ea, aka ENKI, one of the first of the Nephilim to arrive on this planet and establish the first civilization. In Sumerian mythology, Enki's symbol was always the serpent. The serpent represents the DNA, the life force and the kundalini and has survived as the emblem of the American Medical Association and Veterinary medicine, where it is symbolic of life and healing. Only with the coming of Judeo/Christianity, has this sacred symbol been desecrated and blasphemed. Nearly all of us are familiar with the term \"fallen.\" This word has been used copiously by Christian clergy to refer to Satan and his Demons. In truth, \"fallen\" pertains to the kundalini serpent (which has always been associated with our Creator God Satan), which has fallen in humanity as a whole and now lies dormant at the base of the spine. Because of this, humanity as a whole is on a very low level of spiritual understanding. Thoughtless abuses of children and animals, senseless wars, brutality and endless corruption are the results of the fallen serpent. The \"Tree of Life\" which was stolen from the ancient Pagan religions and found its way into the biblical book of Genesis, was seen in many parts of the ancient world in friezes upon walls of ancient temples and in some tombs. The \"Tree of Life\" is actually a map of the human soul. The trunk is the spine and the branches are the pathways for the chi (bioelectricity). The serpent is what empowers the soul, bringing the all-knowing state of super consciousness known as 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"\"samadhi.\" The \"Sun-God\" in truth is the ball of condensed chi (bioelectricity), which is visualized and circulated through each of the chakras (Gods) to empower and cleanse the soul, using specific meditations. This is stage one of the Magnum Opus. The stolen accounts in the Judeo-Christian Bible of humans living for hundreds of years or more were taken from the objective of the Magnum Opus. This is where all so-called \"witchcraft\" leads to- alchemy of the soul. This is the highest and most profound working of the human mind, that of accomplishing the godhead of which is our birthright given to us from our Creator Satan. The halo seen in many paintings is the witchpower of the risen kundalini. The Christians stole this concept from the original religions, both east and west. The Buddha is seen with a halo as are many of the Hindu Gods for one example. The era in which the original religions reigned was known as the \"Golden Age.\" Some 10,000 years ago, the Gods left us. This article is not to go into the details as to how or why. This will be covered in a separate article. The Gods are an extraterrestrial race of beings. As a matter of fact, there have been several different alien races that have lived here on planet Earth, and have taken an interest in human beings, either as friends, enemies, or neutrals. The main Gods who interacted with humanity and are our creators (through genetic engineering) are the race of Gods known as the Nordics. They live throughout the galaxy in several different solar systems. They are highly advanced in knowledge, intelligence, and in spirit. Some are helpful to humans as are Satan and the Elder Gods who have been labeled as “Demons.” Some are neutral and others are and have been working for our destruction. The background concerning the creation can be found in more detail in separate articles on this website. There has been a war over humanity in which Satan and his Demons wish to give us the knowledge to elevate ourselves to spiritual and physical perfection, while the enemy wishes to keep us spiritually ignorant in order to use our life force (souls) as a free energy supply. In many writings of a spiritual or occult nature, the term \"God\" or \"Gods\" was also used to describe the seven chakras. Due to centuries of persecution of those who had spiritual knowledge, doctrines contained many allegories and code words. The number \"seven\" is repeated endlessly in the Judeo/Christian bible. This is a corruption of the seven chakras of the soul. The original cross was equal armed, as seen in many of the Demon Sigils, with the points (representative of the chakras) flaring out. Other well- known examples are the Nazi Iron Cross and the Bikers' cross. In truth, this is the shape of the human soul, and represents the four elements (fire, earth, air and water) of which the human soul is comprised. The number four was stolen and corrupted in the Judeo/Christian Bible as with the number seven, the most blatant example being the four gospels. The Tarot, which originated in Egypt and is based upon the constellations (Egypt was the center of 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy) has evolved into a deck of cards, of which modern playing cards originated after the trump was discarded. The Tarot has a hidden message and instructions for performing the Magnum Opus. From the Tarot, the Jewish invented \"Torah\" was stolen, with the original teachings being thoroughly corrupted. The Jewish \"Torah\" is also known as \"The Five Books of Moses\" (another fictitious Jewish character based upon Sargon and Thutmose) or the \"Pentateuch.\" The five books were rip-offs from the five suits of the Tarot: Wands/Rods (the element of fire), Pentacles/Coins (the element of earth), Cups (the element of water) and Swords (the element of air), with the trump being the aether or quintessence. All five elements form the essence of the human soul (the fifth element of quintessence holds the four together) and are employed in the working of the Magnum Opus. Each of the Jewish characters and archetypes in the Bible are imposters stolen from Pagan Gods. \"Jesus\" is NOT a real being, but a CONCEPT. For those deluded Christians who believe they have experienced \"Jesus\" in reality, they are communing with nefarious extraterrestrial beings. Aleister Crowley while in a trance state, drew a picture of what is known to be \"Jehova\" (a corruption of \"YHVH\" another rip-off of the four quarters and elements, making the 'name' pronouncable) and drew a grey. At that time, knowledge of ET's was not widespread and photos of them were non-existent. These same beings are said to have made a deal with the Vatican: souls in exchange for wealth and power in the hands of a few. To accomplish this end, all spiritual knowledge had to be removed. No scam can succeed if the victim has knowledge. In order to be effectively victimized, one must be unknowing. Satan is the bringer of knowledge and enlightenment. He has nothing to hide. Getting back to the nazarene, the crucifix of which I might add was not seen in any place of worship until after the ninth century and is another rip-off of the four quarters, the Jewish archetype \"Jesus/Yeshua\" is a CONCEPT. The 33 years he was said to have lived represent the 33 vertebrae of the human spine of which the kundalini ascends. The crucifixion symbolizes the Magnum Opus: the torture, the death, and the resurrection. Origins that symbolize this work include the Egyptian phoenix (born again from the ashes), the Egyptian God Set, who was crucified on a furka, the tale of Isis and Osiris, where Osiris was mutilated into some nine parts and was resurrected by Isis. The Jewish \"Virgin Mary\" is a corrupted imposter of Astaroth. Michael the archangel is the same and was stolen from Marduk. Archangel \"Gabriel\" was stolen from the Egyptian God Thoth, Raphael was stolen from Azazel and Uriel from Beelzebub. Again, another rip-off of the four quarters. For further information, links are provided at the bottom of this article. Human sexuality has always been severely regulated and frowned upon by the Christian Church. This is because sexuality and orgasm as the life force are essential to spiritual advancement and the raising of the kundalini serpent. Because the church could not supervise sexual activity, they enforced a doctrine of extreme terror. The populace, stripped of all knowledge and spiritual power (ignorance= fear) fell victim to lies. “Hell” emerged on the scene. The word “Hell” was stolen from the Norse word “Hel” representing the Norse underworld. In truth, \"Heaven\" and \"Hell\" are code-words for the base and crown chakras. Every attempt was made by the church to replace any spiritual associations with these numbers and any significant numbers that were related to the human soul such as 144,000, which is the number of nadis within the human body to channel the life force. The number two became synonymous with Satan. The second chakra is sexual in nature and controls human sexuality, so of course any association with two was evil. Blockages in the second chakra keep an individual completely enslaved spiritually as the life force remains completely dormant in the first chakra. With fear, human beliefs and thoughts can be controlled. Humanity was led to believe this omnipresent and “all-powerful” “God” could know their every little thought and action. Through fear, people began to monitor their own thoughts and actions. The seven sacraments (another rip-off of the seven chakras) of the Catholic Church enforced strict control over every stage of an individual’s life. The most control 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"was exercised through the so-called \"sacrament\" of “confession.” Through confession, the church had even more control, that of knowing the deepest secrets of the frightened population. This enabled the ruling clergy to have power over kings, queens and other secular monarchy. Satan tells us in the Black Book (The Al Jilwah), that many writings and texts have been altered. Upon researching the origins of various myths and religions, I find many authors are at a disagreement, both religious and secular. This is due to the Christian Church's systematic destruction and removal of ancient knowledge. To make matters worse, many of the remaining original documents that escaped destruction have been altered. The Gods left us the truth, inscribed in stone. The pyramids (the pyramids are in the shape of the chakras) have stood against time. It is apparent these ancient monoliths were constructed for future humanity, left to us by the Gods who knew of our fate. These monuments speak for themselves. They were built to reflect the movements of the stars and act as a calendar for beginning the all-important work of the Magnum Opus. The Magnum Opus is normally commenced in the spring, when the Sun enters the sign of Aries, which is known as the \"Vernal Equinox.\" The precise time for beginning this work is at 3 am, which is the hour of Satan. This is the true hour. The fictitious nazarene was said to have perished at 3 pm. 3 pm is actually 15:00, not three and is thus false. The \"Horned God\" originates to Sumeria. The Sumerian Gods wore headgear with horns. This predates Judeo/Christianity by thousands of years. Pagan religions were known for their worship of the Horned God. Only with the coming of Christianity, were they repeatedly stamped out, but continued to resurface and survive. Again, the Horned God was maligned and labeled as \"evil. The Horned God is a symbol of the the chi, the bioelectrical life-force. This is represented by Mercury, as it is fleeting, until fixed through the Magnum Opus. The glyph for the planet Mercury has the horns. The carvings and the hieroglyphics on the Temple walls and the pyramids still remain with us today, as evidence of the truth for those who have enough spiritual knowledge to interpret them. This is why the Gods imprinted these into stone. Satanism is based upon the Magnum Opus. All of the Satanic symbols, the emphasis on witchcraft and knowledge; all of these represent the achievement of the godhead. The Magnum Opus is what Satanism is all about: humanity reaching physical and spiritual perfection. 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Temple of Solomon Now, for those of you who think Modern Freemasonry is of Satan, think again. Modern Freemasonry, which was originally a Gentile order, has been infiltrated and taken over by Jews. Here is an excerpt from the book “Rule by Secrecy” by Jim Marrs, © 2000, pages 58 - 59: “ This secretive banking dynasty was begun by Mayer Amschel Bauer, a German Jew born on February 23, 1744, in Frankfurt...” “Young Mayer studied to become a Rabbi. He was particularly schooled in Hashkalah, a blending of religion, Hebrew law, and reason” “The death of his parents forced Mayer to leave rabbinical school and become an apprentice at a banking house. Quickly learning the trade, he became court financial agent to William IX, royal administrator of the Hesse-Kassel region, and a prominent Freemason. He ingratiated himself to William, who was only one year older than himself, by joining his interest in Freemasonry and antiquities. Mayer would search out ancient coins and sell them to his benefactor at greatly reduced prices. Considering his rabbinical training, coupled with his serious searches for antiquities, he surely developed a deep understanding of the ancient mysteries particularly those of the Jewish Cabala. It was during this same period that the metaphysics of the Cabala began to fuse with the traditions of Freemasonry.\" The Jews infiltrate every source of Gentile power they can. From the inside, they either gain total control or they seek to rot it out and destroy it, through corruption. Modern Freemasonry is now geared to the rebuilding of the \"Temple of Solomon.\" Anyone who knows about the biblical construction of this edifice knows our Demons, namely Asmodeus, were viciously abused and coerced into constructing it against their will by the Jew \"Solomon\" aka \"Shlomo.\" As quoted from \"Legends of the Jews by Lewis Ginzberg, Asmodeus was \"in chains.\" As most of us already know, the Goetic (Gothic) Demons (Gods of the Gentiles) were bound and degraded for centuries. Asmodeus explained much to me and answered most of my questions. The Jewish \"Temple of Solomon\" is an allegory and the underlying theme of the Judeo/Christian bible. The entire bible is a subliminal tool using the directed psychic power of the masses, and reinforced with occult power and magick. It goes like this: Solomon had unimaginable vast wealth. The \"Temple of Solomon\" symbolizes the Jewish people (Israel) as a whole. • 1 Kings 4: 1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 20 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 22 And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. 25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. 29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. 30 And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. 32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. • 1 Kings 10: 21 And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. 24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. \"Solomon\" also had several hundred wives and an overabundance of everything else. Ok, now what becomes of the Gentiles? Read on... • 1 Kings 9: 20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, 21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. 22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. The Gentiles who were not \"UTTERLY DESTROYED\" by the \"Children of Israel\" were made into SLAVES. GET IT?????? The Gentile Gods enslaved by the Jews and viciously abused, following with the mass murder and enslavement of the remaining Gentile people. Asmodeus explained to me that the \"Temple of Solomon\" is the \"empire of the Jews.\" The Nazarene is another allegory where the 12 apostles represent the 12 tribes of Israel and he unites them.

The above biblical scriptures say it all. The Nazarene is also said to be a direct descendent of \"Solomon.\" The theme of the entire Christian program is one of debt and owing. \"Adam and Eve\" \"sinned\" so humanity must pay. This is just one of numerous examples. Everyone’s got to be sorry and pay up. So there is the subliminal on debt and owing. Everyone’s got to be sorry.

The traditional colors of black and red used in Satanism, date all the way back to Ancient Egypt and are symbolic of spiritual transformation. The ancient religions were based upon completing our Creator Satan's work: that of transforming the human soul into that of a god and achieving god-like power and immortality. Satan's Kingdom was stolen from him. The Judeo/Christian Bible is a corruption of stolen material that has been used to spiritually enslave humanity. All of the legends of the Gods are allegories. The Vatican and its cohorts have gained wealth, power, and control by forcing people to believe these allegories are literal places and characters. The completion of the work, what is known in alchemy as the \"Magnum Opus\" has its foundation in the kundalini. The kundalini serpent lies coiled at the base of the spine. Through meditation, the fiery serpent ascends. This is what is known as \"Raising the Devil.\" There are 33 vertebrae in the in the human spinal column. We often hear the term \"33rd degree Mason\" or that the fictitious nazarene lived 33 years. The kundalini serpent ascends the 33 vertebrae of the spine. The seven chakras are also very important in the work. When the kundalini ascends, it must pierce through each of the seven chakras. This is why there is so much emphasis on the number seven in many ancient spiritual texts and also what has been corrupted in the Judeo/Christian Bible. Christian leaders mislead their followers through deceiving them into believing the stolen legends in the bible are real. Through this deception, the Vatican and Christian churches have obtained unbelievable wealth and power. This power is not only in the material world, but in the spiritual as well. All spiritual knowledge was systematically removed with the Inquisition. Those at the top are adept at black magick and have advanced to spiritual power, while the rest of humanity suffers under their control. Many ancient paintings we are told are of the nazarene, \"virgin mary\" and related are really of the Original Gods, such as Marduk (Amon Ra) and Astaroth. The Magnum Opus begins ideally in the spring when the Sun is in Aries, thus the man standing with the lamb. The halo is the ascended kundalini and the vibrant aura of witchpower. The Catholic Church stole this and has been passing it off as their fictitious nazarene. The glyphs for the sign of Aries can be readily seen in Astaroth's Sigil: (All of the Demon Sigils are designs of important alchemical symbols). The story of the creation in the book of genesis is another allegory: \"God' creates the universe in \"seven days,\" \"On the seventh day he rested.\" Those of us who are educated know once the kundalini serpent has ascended through the 6 chakras and passed through the three \"knots\" (trinity), the seventh is effortless. In truth, \"Heaven\" is a code word for the seventh chakra. We have all heard the term \"Seventh heaven.\" \"God\" is a code word for ourselves and also the word \"Gods\" is a code for the chakras in many ancient texts. \"Hell\" is a code word for the base chakra, aka \"the lower world\" where 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"the scorching hot kundalini serpent lies dormant. The tree in the \"Garden of Eden\" in the bible was stolen from many different religions predating Christianity and symbolizes a map of the human soul, the trunk of the tree representing the human spine, with the branches symbolizing the \"144,000\" nadis. \"Adam and Eve\" symbolize the Ida and the Pingala, where the two meet and become one. With the ascended kundalini and the fusion of the ida and pingala at the 6th chakra, gnosis is obtained and one's spiritual eyes are opened. This was originally symbolized in the Egyptian \"All-seeing Eye.\" The separated capstone atop the pyramid symbolizes our Creator Satan's unfinshed work.

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. \"Without form and void\" represent what is known as the \"chaos\" stage in the magnum opus. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. The light is where one creates what is known as the prima materia, the foundation of the philosopher's stone. This is done by condensing the bioelectricity/chi into a ball of light. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. This is a first step and foundation, thus \"the first day.\" 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. The above verses regarding the \"two great lights\" symbolize the heart chakra, where \"heaven\" and \"earth\" meet. As we can see in the downward point of Satan's Sigil, the Satanic Pentagram, and Baphomet, light descends through the crown to the base chakra. 20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"\"The elixir of life, the blessed waters, penetrate down to them [the metals/chakras] and rouse them from their sleep.\" This is what is known as the \"dew\" that is secreted by the pineal gland as a result of power meditation. Birds are also very important symbols in alchemy. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. From the above, again the ALLEGORY is perverted and twisted. The \"sixth day\" is the sixth chakra where the male and female ida and pingala meet. 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work, which God created and made. Here is another alchemical allegory that was stolen and twisted. When the alchemist has completed his/ her work, he/she rests. \"God\" = OURSELVES! The genesis saga continues, all of it stolen and corrupted from religions predating xianity. Genesis 3: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. There is the stage in alchemy where one undergoes a death of the prima materia. This is known as \"nigredo\" \"black stage.\" • \"The initial, black stage of the opus alchymicum in which the body of the impure metal, the matter of the Stone, or the old outmoded state of being is killed, putrefied and dissolved into the original substance of the creation, the prima materia, in order that it may be renovated and reborn in a new form.\"¹ Here is where the fictitious nazarene was also invented. The nazarene was stolen from some 18+ Pagan Gods who were \"crucified\" on a cross or hung from a tree. All of this is an allegory, for example: The Norse God Odin hung from a tree and experienced a death of sorts to obtain knowledge. Through being reborn, he obtained gnosis. The cross represents the all-important four quarters. This is also the meaning of the hanged man card in the Tarot. The Egyptian phoenix has the same meaning- rebirth through fire. The eclipse said to have occurred during the supposed \"crucifixion\" of the nazarene also symbolizes the nigredo stage of blackness. This stage is also symbolized by the black crow and the Black Sun. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: The kundalini serpent transforms, but does not kill. 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. This is the gnosis that the Christian Churches and their nefarious cohorts have relentlessly worked against. Once our eyes have been opened, we can no longer be deceived by ANY lies! 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. Nakedness is another allegory of rebirth. Everyone is born naked. Now, we get to \"Noah\" and the ark, which was stolen from the Sumerian epic of Ziusudra. • \"Noah's flood is a symbol for the 'dissolution of the Stone's matter into the prima materia during the nigredo. At this stage of the opus, the cold, moist, feminine principle (Luna) is said to dominate the hot, dry coagulating male aspect of the opus (Sol).\" ² 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The water element is feminine, while the fire element is masculine. This stage of the opus is symbolized by a flood of energy which is symbolized by the flood of waters. The flood is another allegory of death and regeneration. The ark itself is symbolic of the human body. The allegory of the crow not returning to the ark is symbolic of the stage is not yet completed. The \"dove\" symbolizes the white stage aka the \"albedo.\" • \"The albedo occurs after the blackened matter, the putrefied body of the metal or the matter for the stone, lying dead at the bottom of the alembic, has been washed to whiteness by the mercurial waters.\" ³ It is readily apparent how this allegory has been corrupted into an assumed actual event, complete with characters. 4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. AGAIN, the number seven and \"rest.\" This symbolizes the seventh chakra, which is effortless bliss and the \" mountains of Ararat\" symbolize the completed work, which was STOLEN from the meaning of the Egyptian pyramids- the apex point at the top which has its foundation at the four quarters. Now, I might also add here- to the fools who have been attacking Enili/Beelzebub with drowning humanity- GET A LIFE!!!! Knowledge comes from Satan. 13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. The \"bow\" is the rainbow, the iridescent colors that indicate another higher stage of the magnum opus has been completed. THIS STAGE, I MIGHT ADD IS ALSO SYMBOLIZED BY THE PEACOCK. THE PEACOCK IS A SYMBOL OF AND IS SACRED TO SATAN! Verse 13 reads: \"a covenant between me and the earth.\" \"God\" is another alchemical code word for the crown chakra, aka \"heaven\" (the top three chakras are also symbolic of 'heaven') \"paradise\" \"bliss\" and the earth is the lower world, symbolized by the three lower chakras. This indicates \"heaven\" and earth have been merged at the heart chakra. The following biblical books are the fictitious history of the Jewish people. The \"torah\" was STOLEN and corrupted from the Egyptian Tarot. The \"Torah\" is also known as the \"Pentateuch,\" the five books of \"Moses\" (another fictitious character). One can see this was stolen from the five suits of the Tarot- the wands/rods (suit of fire); the pentacles (suit of earth); the cups (suit of water); and the swords (suit of air) and of course the trump, representing the element of the quintessence. • \"The nigredo stage ends on the surface of a starry aspect, which is likened to the night sky which told shepherds and kings that a child was born in Bethlehem.\" 4 AGAIN, this is symbolic and indicates another stage of the work, when one can 'see' the light of the chi stone in the black void, when one's eyes are closed, during meditation. The \"three\" magi represent the three stages of the work. The fictitious nazarene- the stone (which was born from the work). • \"There are three stones, or three works, or three degrees of perfection, within the work.\" 5 Here we go again with twisted allegories in relation to that fictitious nazarene – the \"crucifixion\" – two others were crucified with the nazarene, making three. 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"I could go on and on and on, citing biblical verses and revealing how they were stolen and corrupted. The character of the nazarene, which was invented from an allegory has: 1. Acted to remove all spiritual knowledge and replace it with bullshit. The \"Jesus saves\" crap (ad nauseum) and the \"born again\" have been twisted and incorporated into this fictitious character. in other words, deluded ones have been deceived into believing this character will take care of everything spiritual as long as they conform to the agenda. 2. The \"Jesus\" character has acted as the thought police for ultimate control. Wars have been fought repeatedly over beliefs and ideas. Control what is in the mind of humanity and you will control humanity. 3. Since the nazarene is fictitious, he can be anything to anyone which those in powerful positions in the xian program dictate. He can change with the times and conform to any agenda. It is time everyone wakes up to the spiritual corruption that has played humanity to the tune of trillions and trillions of dollars, souls and everything else these parasites have taken their followers for a ride with.

This power was forcibly removed from the Gentiles through the Jewish tool of Christianity, where the Gentile Gods were all replaced with imposter Jewish characters and archetypes, leaving the names and characters of the Original Gods to be blasphemed as hideous Demons and insulting monster images. Gentile legends were stolen, twisted and corrupted and perverted into Jewish literary trash. Sacred texts which contained the wisdom and teachings of the Gentile Gods, designed to help and give to humanity the knowledge to advance the soul and to reach a higher level of spirituality were systematically replaced with Jewish literary filth and meaningless rabbinical drivel that fills up the Talmud, the Torah and the Judeo/Christian bible. The so-called \"Torah\" is really a perversion of the Egyptian Tarot. The same as with the Kabalah. This is why the Judeo/Xian Bible contains to many dire warnings to keep Gentiles from accesssing occult knowledge. \"Yeshua\" which is \"Jesus\" means \"May his name be blotted out.\" It is so obvious who they are referring to here. That worthless king of slaves hanging off a cross is a fictitious imposter, another Jewish archetype designed to replace the Real Gods, namely our Creator God who is SATAN and erase his existence from our memory (May his name be blotted out). This is not only a huge slap in the face for Gentiles, but an abombination to our Gods. The more I study, going deeper into the occult, it is glaringly apparent SATAN is GOD. What is left of the original texts which were altered is nothing but Jewish literary trash, rabbinical bullshit writings and other Jewish garbage. Modern occult teachings have been infested with Hebrew letters, Jewish angelic archetypes and are based upon the Jewish version of everything. Blatant examples include (King James version of the Bible): 2 Kings 18: 27 \"But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?\" Job 20: 7 \"Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?\" The story of Job was stolen from \"The Story of Keret.\" The original story of Job, was written in the Ugaritic language (Cuneiform Script), composed circa 1400 BCE by \"Ilimilku The Scribe.\" This epic involves \"Keret\" and the God \"El.\" NOT Job and fictitious \"Jehova.\" In the original tale, \"Satan\" never even entered into the picture. Other Gentile legends that compose the Job epic include: • The Sufferer and the Soul • The Farmer and the Courts • The Sufferer and the Friend Writings concerning excrement were not in the original texts. More rabbinical filth includes: Proverbs 26:11 \"As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.\" 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Isaiah 19:14 \"The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.\" Isaiah 30:22 \"Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.\" Jeremiah 4:4 \"Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.\" Jeremiah 8:2 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. The above is just a tiny sample of the endless Jewish literary filth that fills the bible, which was designed to deceive and enslave the Gentiles. This is what the teachings of our Gods have been replaced with. This sick garbage has been indoctrinated into Gentile children and force fed to the Gentile people throughout their entire lives. It is no wonder so many have such a negative view of spirituality. Few people are familiar with the Egyptian Kabalah. The True Kabalah is an instruction of four dimensional meditation of which is very powerful; using specific chants, tones and vibrations and applying these to different aspects of the soul. The original kabalah was based upon the runes of which are based upon the constellations, like the Tarot. This is only a very brief summary as the instructions are complex and require much study. What the Jews have done with this is again, they took it out of circulation, keeping this knowledge in the hands of the top Jews for world control (why they have so much wealth and power), and used their tool of Christianity to murder the Gentiles who had this knowledge, such as the Druids. Pretty much all that is left in public circulation is remnants of sacred knowledge that have been desecrated, corrupted and defiled, of which only few twisted and distorted scraps remain, such as the \"gematria\" which is a corruption of and used as a distraction from the real texts and that Jewish story about the \"golem\" of which is based upon the elements and their corrupted \"tree of life.\" Fictitious Jewish \"YHVH\" and Jewish angelic archetypes are always held in esteem while Gentile Gods are relegated to the \"qlippoth\" of death, filth and excrement. 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The White Chapel Go to the bottom for an explanation with interpretations.

It appears to be a combination of two Greek words baphe and metis meaning “absorption of knowledge.” Other authors claim it is a corruption of “Mohamet” (Mohammed), but the first definition seems to be more accurate. Baphomet has its origins in the “Goat of Mendes.” Baphomet was also one of the aliases of Aleister Crowley. Baphomet has also been called the \"Goat of Mendes\" and the \"Black Goat.\" The goat also has to do with fertility and is symbolic of the Magnum Opus of alchemy when one's energies from kundalini increase. Spiritual alchemy is of Ancient Egypt and is the transformation of the human soul into the godhead. This is completing our Creator God Satan's work. The most famous historical account of Baphomet began with the Knights Templar. The Baphomet at the time of the Templars was believed to be an idol, represented by a human skull, a stuffed human head or a metal or wooden head with curly black hair, or sometimes a black cat. The idol was said to be worshipped by the Knights Templar in their latter days as the source of fertility and wealth. The Knights Templars also known as the “poor knights of christ” was founded in the year 1118 by Hugh de Payens of Champagne France. The order began with nine or eleven men who were sent to the Holy Land to dig beneath the \"Temple of Solomon\" for several European families of wealth who had claim to certain artifacts buried there before it was destroyed in 70 CE. The order took on the oath of asceticism, celibacy, devotion to the Catholic Church and poverty. They were forbidden ownership of any personal property. Any wealth accrued by the order was to be shared in common. When excavating beneath the temple, the knights discovered gold and ancient relics, and also many scrolls. Shortly thereafter, magnificent cathedrals and other buildings sprung up all over Europe. Most of the Goetic/Gothic Demons are known for their expertise in architecture and there are legends claiming many bridges and buildings in Europe were built by Satan and his Demons.² The true meaning of the \"Temple of Solomon\" is the TEMPLE OF THE SUN. \"Sol\" \"Om\" and \"On\" are all words for the Sun. \"Sol\" is the Latin word for the Sun and is close to the English word \"soul.\" \"Om\" is a name given by the Hindus to the Spiritual Sun and \"On\" is an Egyptian word for Sun. The symbolism of the Temple of Solomon was stolen and made into an actual character, as with the fictitous nazarene and nearly everything in the Judeo/Christian Bible. For more information: The Removal and Desecration of the Original Gentile Religious Texts Exposing Spiritual Corruption: Spiritual Alchemy & The Bible The Templars were eventually appointed to protect the Holy Land and keep it from the Moslems during the wars of the Crusades. The order grew into the thousands and groups were organized throughout Europe, but France remained their stronghold. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Their seal depicts two men riding one horse because in the early history of the order, the knights could not afford a horse each. During their journeys to and from the Holy Land in the Middle East, they encountered many different peoples. It is possible, they learned of the Goat of Mendes as the Moslems kept records and had knowledge of the history of Ancient Egypt where the Goat of Mendes originated. The Templars grew in both size and wealth, reaching their peak in the 14th century. The ending of the wars of the Crusades did not have any impact on the order as they used the opportunity to travel and enter into commerce and money lending. They established a very profitable business relationship with the enemy in times of truce. The order accumulated vast wealth and power. They eventually became the victims of both the greedy Catholic Church that was aware of their forbidden knowledge and King Philip IV of France who was said to be heavily in debt and owed the order a considerable sum. *From what I have researched, it appears the real reason the Templar order was persecuted by the Catholic Church was for their occult knowledge and power they obtained from excavating beneath the Temple at the Dome of the Rock. This power brought them vast wealth as it is supposed to do for those who have it and the knowledge on how to use it. Philip IV plotted along with Pope Clement V to destroy the order. October 13th 1307, Philip IV had Grand Master Jacques de Molay and 140 other knights arrested in the Paris Temple. More arrests followed throughout France. The Templars were subjected to torture en masse. The Catholic Church with its inquisitors, accused them of Devil worship, blasphemy, sodomy, and idolatry. There was secrecy surrounding their meetings and wild rumors spread concerning bizarre initiation rituals that did much to promote public suspicion of the order. Under torture, members of the order admitted to renouncing the nazarene, spitting, trampling and urinating on the crucifix, engaging in intercourse with Demons, indulging in “sexual perversity” and to worshipping the idol of Baphomet. Many of the Templars were burned at the stake and murdered by the inquisition, the most noted being Grand Master Jacques de Molay. After being imprisoned and tortured for seven years, he was burnt alive at the stake. The Shroud of Turin was of the blood and body fluids of Jacques de Molay as he was laid on a soft feather bed to recover for more torture from the Catholic inquisitors. Upon close examination, it is obvious given the position of the body (the top part is shown below), there is no way this was the Nazarene. The shroud was also inspected by several diverse scholars who proved beyond any doubt, given the material and constituents, the item was no older than the 12th century. The Catholic Church being the prolific liar that it is, continues to scam people to this day 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"I would also like to add in revising this article in light of new knowledge, Christianity appears to have manifested with the Inquisition. It is nowhere near as old as the \"two thousand years\" they claim it to be. History is and has been rewritten with lies, while being destroyed at the same time. A very blatant example is what is now and has been occurring in Iraq. What we have been indoctrinated to believe in history class is not necessarily the truth. Ancient relics and architecture speak for themselves. In addition, history was written and told by the winners of every war. Remember, there are always two sides to every account. ONe side is usually the only one that is heard along with permissible opinions only. Along with the \"Shroud of Turin lie (the Nazarene is fictitious and was stolen from an alchemical concept of a working which had its origin in some 18+ PAGAN Gods, such as Odin, who hung from a tree and Set who was crucified on a Furka, Osiris who died and was resurrected, etc.), many PAGAN Gods have been passed off as the Nazarene such as Apollo Images by the hundreds of Pagan Gods are now labeled as the Nazarene. This is no different from the Christianization of Pagan holidays, such as Easter (of Astaroth), the Yule (which originally had nothing whatsoever to do with the fictitious Nazarene) of which xian fundies are now weeding out the Pagan traditions and replacing them with lies, as they have done with Pagan Temples which were destroyed and had xian churches built directly over them. Before he was murdered at the stake, Molay cursed both the Pope and the King and predicted the death of both within the year. (Both did die within that time period). The Baphomet evolved over the centuries. The most widely known representation of the Baphomet is the drawing by 19th century French magician Eliphas Levi called “the Baphomet of Mendes.” Levi combined the images of the Tarot Devil card and the he-goat worshipped in the city of Mendes in Ancient Egypt. It is unclear whether the Ancient Egyptian women had intercourse with the goat during religious rites for fertility, but the Catholic Church claimed this and this is more than likely where the notion that the Devil had intercourse with his witches came from. Levi’s famous drawing of Baphomet depicts a male/female image representing the dualistic nature of life. Female breasts and the phallus, one arm masculine, the other feminine, one arm pointing up and the other pointing down representing the Hermetic principle of “as above, so below.” 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Levi Baphomet is very similar to the Egyptian Akhenaton, which is both male and female (note the male and female features of the body and the serpentine facial features which symbolize the serpent kundalini) portraying the hermaphrodite which is symbolic of merging the male and female aspects of the soul, the ida and the pingala and achieving the godhead. The \"monotheism\" is another allegory, as the \"gods\" are in many ancient writings, code-words for the chakras of the soul and when one works to achieve the godhead of the Magnum Opus, all of the chakras are transformed and united into gold. Yoga is a branch of alchemy and the word \"Yoga\" means \"union.\" This is the unification of the soul. His illustration combines the goat headed Devil of the Witches Sabbats, the God of the Templars and the Devil in the Tarot cards. In Levi’s view, this image represented the power of the universe depicting both good and evil influences. The image continued to evolve over the years. Anton LaVey spotted an illustration in the book “A Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural” by Maurice Bessy © 1961, English edition © 1964. This was the first known published work where the goat headed pentagram was surrounded by two circles and included the Hebrew letters reading “Leviathan.” The names “Samael” and “Lilith” were also included in this depiction. \"Leviathan\" also known as \"Cthulu\" is a name for the kundalini serpent Anton LaVey eliminated the Samael and Lilith and decided this particular symbol best represented the Church of Satan and made it the Church’s logo in 1967. Because of the Hebrew lettering and the circles which are highly offensive to Satan and his Demons, JoS Ministries has removed them and replaced them with cuneiform script reading “Satan.” The sign of Capricorn, symbolized by the goat represents the new winter sun being reborn again as the days get longer. The goat is one of Satan’s sacred animals. In the fifth century BCE, Herodotus reported that the people of Mendes in the Nile delta venerated all goats, particularly male ones. For the Greeks and Romans, the goat represented virility. Goats are fertile and known to be lusty. The city of Mendes reached its cultural peak when the Ram-God was worshipped, whom the Greeks later equated with Pan. Pan was known as a \"satyr.\" Satyrs had the horns, legs, hooves, and beards of goats. Pan’s symbol was the phallus and he was invoked for the fertility of the flocks or an abundant hunt. He tended flocks and danced through the woods, playing his panpipes, which he invented. As the lusty leader of Satyrs, he 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"chased the Nymphs. The goat (sometimes a ram was used) was the master of fertility and was celebrated as “copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes,” where women were blessed with children. During rituals, women danced naked before the image. The Order of Nine Angles claims another perspective to Baphomet. 7,000 years ago a civilization known as Albion had various rites associated with a Dark Goddess who was known as “Baphomet.” References: ¹The Second Messiah : Templars, the Turin Shroud, and the Great Secret of Freemasonry by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas.

Christianity, which began with the Catholic Church, was invented to physically enforce the above and also, to destroy and to replace the original religions. The original religions centered around the reverence for the serpent. The serpent is the symbol of the kundalini. The \"Tree of Knowledge\" is really the map of the human soul. It is seen in nearly every ancient religion pre-dating Judeo/Christianity. The trunk symbolizes the spine, and the branches symbolize the chakras and the kundalini pathways. There are 144,000 nadis (channels for the kundalini life force) within the human soul. The Buddah sat beneath the \"Bo Tree\" and achieved enlightenment. \" Bo means serpent, as in Bo-A or Boo-Ta.\" ¹ The Christian Church stole, twisted and corrupted everthing they could from the original religions. The fig tree was known as \"The Tree of Wisdom\" Ficus religiosa. ² The xian church corrupted this with the placing of fig leaves over the genitals of Adam and Eve. 3. \"Satan\" in Hebrew means \"enemy\" and \"adversary.\" Now, the word \"Satan\" goes back much, much further than the Hebrew definition.

All variations of the name \"SATAN\" mean TRUTH in Sanskrit, which is one of the world's oldest and most ancient of languages. All of this has to do with the kundalini life force (the serpent) within us. \"Jacob's coat of colors\" in the bible is the aura. The number seven is the chakras. The interpreters of the old grimoires have it all wrong about the \"seven planets.\" The ancients knew much more than given credit for regarding astronomy. Anyone familiar with Chinese medicine and advanced martial arts is aware of the chi (the life force, same as the kundalini) and how it is more active in certain pathways in the body on certain days and hours. I uploaded a chart to the meditations section for this. The authors of alchemy texts in those days put their writings in codes in order to escape persecution by the church. The sun was another object of veneration for the original religions. This was because of the pure, raw power it bestowed and as it is the source of all life. Drawing down the moon or absorbing energy from the stars is nothing compared to what can be done under the sun, given the knowledge and training. JoS clergy members know this. Holes in the aura are healed and the life force is amplified as with no other source of light. \"Lucifer\" was also given to our beloved Father as a name. Lucifer was originally a Roman God with no connection to our Father Satan/Ea. The prefix \"Luc\" has to do with light. The soul needs light. The morning star, Venus, was a source of light for the ancients as its rising preceded the all-important sun. Venus also rules the important heart chakra. Father Satan (I prefer to call him Satan, personally), told me he has no problem with people calling him 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"by the names he has been known by for centuries, even though they are inaccurate. I call him Father Satan whenever I communicate with him or thank him for something. To me \"Satan\" will always mean \"adversary,\" adversary to the enemy lie of Judeo/Christianity. The Catholic Church knew the original religions had to be replaced with something else and this is where all of the stories in the bible came from. They are all rip-offs from the originals, which had their origins long before Judeo/Christianity ever reared its ugly head. The Virgin Mary stole from and replaced Astaroth, who was bound, as \"the Lady of Heaven.\" Astaroth was the most popular Goddess in the pre-Christian world. Fictitious Jehova ripped off from Enlil/Beelzebub/Baal, who was the most popular God in the pre-Christian world, and then there is our beloved Creator Father Satan/Ea who wound up as the Serpent and the Devil. Sexuality, which is the primary aspect of the life force, automatically came under intense scrutiny by the church. Orgasm directly stimulates the kundalini serpent the base of the spine. The creative energy needed to produce another human life can be used to revamp one's life force which advances and empowers one's soul. Obviously sexual activity could not be prohibited, so fear was used to place it under strict regulation. In the xian religions, especially the Catholic Church of old, all sexual pleasure was sinful and prohibited by the church. Intercourse was only to produce children and nothing more. Nakedness became a sin because it led to lust. Masturbation was another \"mortal sin.\" Anything that had to do with the raising of the kundalini was severely attacked by the church. The sole purpose of the Christian Church was for the removal of knowledge and nothing more. While the masses have been stripped of this knowledge and power, a select few who have worked to remove this knowledge use it liberally to enslave the unknowing world. The Jesuit assassins of the Catholic Church are known to even levitate as they draw off of the psychic power from the prayers of their unknowing vicitms. ¹Cloak of the Illuminati by William Henry, 2003 ² Ibid.

What happens when I make a formal commitment to Satan? Satan looks out for his own. Satan gives us an inner strength and we become very strong in spirit. Unlike right hand path religions, where adherents are forever praying and searching for their god, Satan comes to us on his own. Many times, we can feel him. He comes to guide us when we get down, worried, or are experiencing problems. He snaps us into line and directs us as to what we need to do to be focused and happy. The foundation of Spiritual Satanism is in our finishing Satan's work upon humanity. This is the goal of the godhead, and is accomplished through power meditation. Humanity is currently at a very low level spiritually. When we begin to meditate, we experience profound positive changes within our lives. Satan and his Demons (The Original Gods) protect us and look out for us as we transform and achieve personal power. With Satan, we have protection that outsiders do not have. We can advance in the powers of the mind and soul as far as we wish. For outsiders, this can prove dangerous. Satan also gives us knowledge. \"I lead to the straight path without a book.\" As we transform and grow, our lives change for the better and we are much happier. We learn through Satan how to take control of our own lives and destiny instead of being at the mercy of fate. We learn to heal ourselves, and to fulfill our own desires, using the powers of our mind and soul. In making a commitment, we engage a formal ritual. This is done out of free will. We are making a choice, as opposed to being dragged off to some Christian church, and reciting canned prayers (stolen and corrupted from Eastern mantras) in front of a bunch of idiots. With knowledge and research, we can prove beyond all doubt that the nazarene, \"jehova\" and ilk are all fictitious characters, stolen from and corrupted concepts to remove all spiritual knowledge so that a \"chosen\" few can rule the world using powers of the mind and soul. For further information, please visit www.exposingchristianity.com Because so many have been forcefully indoctrinated with these characters, and what they stand for (Enemies of Satan), we renounce them permanently in the dedication ritual. This proves to be psychologically healthy and liberating. The initiation ritual is very personal, unless you decide to have friends participate, or are doing it as part of a group. You will need: • 1 or more black, blue or red candles (as many as you like) • A sterilized needle or razor • A piece of clean paper, large enough to write the prayer below • A dry pen, where you sign your name in blood (dip the ip of the pen in your blood) Write the following prayer: Before the almighty and ineffable God Satan/Lucifer and in the presence of all Demons of Hell, who are the True and the Original gods, I, (state your full name) renounce any and all past allegiances. I renounce the false Judeo/Christian god Jehova, I renounce his vile and worthless son Jesus Christ, I 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"renounce his foul, odious, and rotten holy spirit.

Take the needle, prick the index finger of your left hand, squeeze some blood out. Sign your name in blood.

Satanic rituals are real and binding. The ritual should only be done ONE TIME! Question: I performed the ritual. I could barely get any blood on the paper, is the ritual still valid? Answer: YES!! The amount of blood does not matter, this is only a formality. What is in our hearts and what our intentions are, are much more important than the amount of blood in our signature. Question: Can I reverse the ritual at a later date? Answer : Satanic rituals, unlike the rituals in other religions, are real and permanent. I received a very small number of letters from people who were confused and harassed by Christians. One person performed a reverse ritual and Satan left him. Totally. Satan does not push himself on anyone. Christians are deceived. They believe their \"God\" to be \"loving\" and \"forgiving.\" In truth, this monster is a spiteful, hateful attacker of human beings. When one is with Satan, one is always under his protection. He looks out for us and we enter a new life where we no longer have the worries that others endure. Things are not perfect, but they are always much better. Satan does not punish people who reject him, he simply leaves and one is left all alone to endure the torments of the enemy. These people wrote to me because after several months, they were begging for Satan to take them back. The enemy did absolutely nothing for them. All were extremely regretful they ever left and very desperate to come back. 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Question: I am under-age and my parents would cause me serious problems if they ever caught me doing a Satanic ritual. Answer: If there is absolutely no way you can perform the ritual without placing yourself in danger, you can perform it in your astral temple. You can do the above ritual when you are older. Performing the dedication on the astral is every bit as valid as doing it physically. Satan is very understanding concerning teens who are forced into accepting Christianity while living at home and being underage. Question: I am underage, living in a Christian home and my parents force me to go to church and participate in Christian sacraments. Can I still do the dedication? Will Satan be angry with me? Answer: Yes, you can still perform the ritual. Satan understands. As long as you are loyal to him in your heart, he will not be angry with you. Those of you under 18 are not free. There is no need to reveal your allegiance to Satan to anyone. What is in your heart is more important than anything else. Satan advises us in the Al-Jilwah not to reveal our religion to outsiders if it will cause us harm in any way, this is especially important for teens. Just renounce the Christian \"God\" in your mind if you are forced to participate in any of his garbage. Satan understands it can be downright dangerous, and in some cases even life-threatening for teens living in Christian homes to reveal their allegiance to him. 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Satanic Symbols 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"It is a sad fact that few Satanists know the real meaning of our symbols.

Every Satanic symbol represents powerful spiritual meaning in regards to humanity reaching the godhead of spiritual and physical perfection and immortality. Most if not all Satanic symbols pertain to the soul. The Point Down Pentagram symbolizes energy entering our crown chakra from above.

They are NOT monsters. Many are well known and popular EGYPTIAN GODS. For centuries, they have been spiritually abused using enemy god names, nine foot circles and a plethora of blasphemies and insults. This is the reason many appeared as monsters. The Demons are all of the Pre- Christian Gods; the ORIGINAL GODS. - High Priestess Maxine Dietrich, May, 2003 THE DEMONS ARE NOT EVIL! Because of the perversions of good and evil by the mainstream religions and society in general, many people are confused. (Read my sermon on \"freethought\"). There is no reason one should fear Satan's Demons. When treated with respect and approached with honest intentions, they are truly wonderful. Their greater purpose is to teach humanity. As for purposes of revenge and the punishment of enemies, this is a part of learning, as justice is essential. Turning the other cheek creates true lawlessness, chaos and the eventual collapse of civilized society. Revenge and justice are necessary, for without correction; offenders only continue in their abusive behavior and freely abuse others. When we make friends with the Demons, they often visit revenge upon those whose intention is to wrong us, and they also watch our backs. I have seen my enemies and the enemies of my loved ones punished before I even had to ask. Many of the Demons specialize in the teaching of ethics. This right here attests to the reality that Demons are not evil. Responsibility to the responsible. Honor and truth are VERY important to Satan. Satan looks with hatred upon those who are cowards and are too weak to take responsibility for their actions. Satan represents the strong and the just. The Demons are the Nephilim, (the Original Gods) the ancient extra-terrestrials who came to Earth to mine for gold thousands of years ago. They are very intellectually, physically and spiritually advanced. Many took human wives/husbands and were cursed for this by other Gods who opposed anything that would educate or elevate human beings above that of an animal. Human beings were intended to be slaves and when the mining project was finished, they were to be destroyed. The Demons befriended humans and wished for us to become as the Gods, just as Father Satan attempted to bring humans godly knowledge and power. For this, they were cursed and punished. The Demons are very human friendly. I have had the privilege of having them work with me and teach me. I have established true friendships with several Demons who have helped me in so many ways. I have learned so much from my Demon teachers. Given the destruction of ancient libraries and centers of learning by Xians, so much knowledge has been lost forever. Sometimes Demons can be strict in encouraging us to better ourselves, but this is for our own well being and development. Satan states in the Al Jilwah: “I lead to the straight path without a revealed book.” The popular grimoires and occult books available in the mainstream bookstores are a major source of trouble. The grimoires were written by rabbis and Xians. The Demons are NOT \"empty shells\" as kabbalists claim. They are not the \"qlippoth.\" The Demons I have worked with have very powerful, positive energy and are very much alive. Since we performed energy work on them, they have drastically increased their power. Many of them now have very bright auras. Concerning vampirism and the \"qlippoth,” the Xian \"God\" exemplifies both, as most Xians are spiritually depleted. Look at the Catholic Pope- he is an empty shell. The doctrines of the right hand 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"path religions advocating asceticism, self-denial and other anti-life practices harmful to human beings are representative of \"qlippoth.\" The teachings concerning the qlippoth are another way the enemy denigrates and slanders our Gods.

When we summon the Demons, they sometimes manifest themselves through astral projection. Normally, they communicate with us telepathically. 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"How to Summon Demons *For people who have had problems in getting a Demon to appear, click on the link at the bottom of the page The most important thing you can do is forget everything you have been taught about Demons from sources that are hostile to Satanism. There is nothing but misinformation from most of the readily available and most popular writings. Following the instructions written in most grimoires is not only wrong, but can be very dangerous. My own experience with various Demons is that they are very proud and being respectful is very important. Recently, several High Priests and High Priestesses performed energy work with many different Demons including all of the Demons of the Goetia. All 72 of the Goetic Demons have been freed and many more. We found the true identities of most of these Demons. Many have used different aliases in order to avoid being viciously abused. These Demons, unlike the descriptions given in many of the old grimoires are not monsters. They are beautiful, popular, and important Gods. ASMODEUS TOLD SOLOMON: \"SO ASK ME NOT MANY THINGS; FOR THY KINGDOM ALSO AFTER A LITTLE TIME IS TO BE DISRUPTED AND THY GLORY IS BUT FOR A SEASON, AND SHORT WILL BE THY TYRANNY OVER US.\" Demons are immortal; a “season” is but a few thousand years to them. The Christian \"God\" is losing power. Father Satan has informed me that our side has won. We warn everyone: using the spiritually abusive methods of the old grimoires is not only foolish, but will inevitably result in personal disaster. The Demons must always be approached with extreme honesty and respect. The days of using enemy \"God\" names, nine-foot circles, threats and other destructive and abusive methods are over. Don't say you weren't warned.... When we are new, most of the Demons are willing to help us. The goal of Satanism is to become as a god. This means self-empowerment. As we progress through our own efforts, we become more and more adept. We should be able to rely upon our own powers instead of the powers of others outside of us. The Demons are best when it comes to imparting knowledge and wisdom, so that we may learn and advance our own powers. As we progress, we should be able to be competent in all aspects of magick and be able to influence others and our environments on our own, without any outside help. Although, even with an adept, there may be circumstances where issues can be overwhelming and the help of a Demon is needed. For spiritual guidance, the Demons are here for us at all levels, from those who are new, to those who are advanced. From my own experiences, I would highly recommend to those of you who are serious in progressing spiritually, to establish a close and strong relationship with a Demon who is willing to work with you and guide you along the left hand path. This can be a very rewarding experience to say the least. 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"How to summon: Always treat the Demons with honesty and respect. Never command, demand or try to exploit them in any way. THE CORRECT METHODS FOR SUMMONING A DEMON: 1. Know the Demon you intend to summon. This website lists the attributes and available knowledge about different Demons. All of the Goetic Demons are human friendly, as we know from experience. 2. It is important to have a specific purpose; know exactly *why* you are summoning a particular Demon. 3. When we ask assistance from a Demon, it is only proper to offer something in return. Be prepared to give something in return. This is something both you and the Demon should agree upon. Remember, the Elder Gods value one’s word, honesty, integrity and one’s honor as the utmost importance. NEVER agree to anything you know you cannot follow through on. 4. Know the method you plan to use to communicate with the Demon. One of the most important steps in the summoning of a Demon you are not yet familiar with, is to go through Satan. The reasons for this are serious. Not all Demons are friendly to humans, nor are all Demons of Satan. Satan has authority over all of the Goetic Demons. Most Demons are friendly when treated with respect and summonings result in a positive experience. I have found many Demons that have caused outsiders problems are often friendly to a confirmed Satanist. I have learned much through my own interactions with Demons and through the many experiences of others, both the laity and the Ministry. Experience is, as always, the best teacher. There are different levels of experience when one establishes contact with a Demon: 1. The Demon speaks to us through our thoughts (telepathy). With telepathy, the words of the Demon come to us through our thoughts. In the beginning, it can be difficult for those who are not as sensitive or lack psychic ability to differentiate between the communication from another entity and their own thoughts. With power meditation and experience, this becomes much easier over time. 2. We see and hear the Demon. This is with people who are more psychic and open. 3. We invoke the energy of the Demon. This is powerful and electrifying. We are engulfed in a strong aura. During this time, we will often hear the Demon speak to us and we may in addition, see the Demon. 4. During an actual summoning, the Demon appears and speaks to us through scrying into a mirror, in the smoke of the incense, or in some other manner. This is best for those who are new. With scrying, if we are sensitive enough, we can often feel the Demon touch us if he/she chooses to do so. 5. Tangible contact; objects in our rooms are moved, there is actual physical evidence of the Demon having been present. There are accounts in popular books concerning extremely powerful energies encountered when evoking a Demon. To my knowledge, no one using the methods outlined on this website has ever experienced anything negative or overwhelming. I have invoked Demons many times (see Invocation & Evocation ) and the energy was never beyond anything I couldn’t handle or in any way 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"uncomfortable. Methods: Copy, print out or draw the sigil of the Demon you wish to summon on clean paper. It is important that you be left alone and not disturbed in any way. Close your eyes and visualize the sigil in your mind as best you can. It is ok to open them and look at the sigil again ( as many times as needed) to get a clearer image. While visualizing, recite, or chant the name of the Demon repeatedly either in your mind or aloud. Recite the following prayer: Lord Satan, by your grace, grant me, I pray thee the power to conceive in my mind and to execute that which I desire to do, the end which I would attain by thy help, O Mighty Satan, the one True God who livest and reignest forever and ever. I entreat thee to inspire__________(name of Demon) to manifest before me that he/she may give me true and faithful answer, so that I may accomplish my desired end, provided that it is proper to his/her office. This I respectfully and humbly ask in Your Name, Lord Satan, may you deem me worthy, Father. The Demon can manifest in different ways. • Through a mirror as in \"scrying.\" You will see the Demon in the mirror. • Through the smoke of the incense • The Demon appears directly, when one is sensitive enough and in a deep meditative state. Prepare your area. Your first summoning rituals should be performed at night. The reasons for this are the energies are different at night from those during the day and it is easier to be alone and free from distractions. When one has established relationships with certain Demons, it is no longer necessary to perform a formal summoning ritual. The Demon can appear to us night or day and all we need do is concentrate to contact them through telepathy. You will need: • A quiet place where you will not be disturbed. • Quality incense with a pleasing fragrance. I strongly recommend when working with any new incense to try it out before the actual ritual or summoning as cheap stinking incense is insulting to the spirits and can be embarrassing in any ritual. See INCENSE • One or more black or blue candles. Black is choice, but blue is ok for a substitute if you cannot obtain black. Also, if available, the candle color of the specific Demon you wish to summon. (These are listed on this website). • Your paper containing the Demon’s sigil. When finished with the sigil, find a safe place to store it, preferably in your own black book or journal. ALWAYS treat this paper/sigil with extreme respect and NEVER burn it! The sigil can be reused. There is no need for a nine-foot circle. Demons *hate* circles and there is no need for a “license to depart” as both are offensive and insulting. Treat the Demons with respect and in turn, you will receive the same. After the petition to Satan, you should feel his positive energy. This is a good sign and a go-ahead. If for some reason the Demon doesn’t answer, try another time. Many times the Demon does appear, but those who are new to summoning are not psychically open enough or experienced to sense him/her. 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Most people have had to perform the summoning ritual more than once for the Demon to manifest. Often, the Demon does answer, but many are not aware. Look for coincidences and things out of the ordinary. Awareness here is everything. Always offer a token of appreciation and gratitude in return for his/her services. Some ideas are publicity for the Demon, working against Christianity, working to advance Satanism or any service that you both can agree upon. **I have received many personal e-mails and many posts have been made to the Joy of Satan e-groups concerning the summoning of Demons and the trouble some people have with seeing, hearing and sensing the presence of a Demon. People come to Satanism with differing levels of psychic ability. Psychic ability is when one's soul is open enough to sense things that most others cannot. This is the goal of Spiritual Satanism: empowering humanity spiritually. Human souls have been sealed up, so little if anything other than the material world can be accessed. The judeo/xian churches always have been and are a tool for removing spiritual knowledge and replacing it with lies and total materialism. The effect has been that through the centuries, humanity has experienced generational atrophy of the soul and spirit. People who have had psychic experiences are often at a loss to explain or even understand them. Some of us who have been with Satan throughout many reincarnations are more psychically open. This also applies to anyone who worked in any of their past lives to develop their souls and psychic powers. There are plenty of people who have not developed their powers in their past lives or in this life and as a result, they are unable to sense the presence of Demons when they summon them. Many of these people feel they are being ignored or they may feel disillusioned. There is no need to feel this way as psychic senses and abilities can be developed at any time through power meditation, which is the foundation of Spiritual Satanism. For those of you who are having problems, please be patient and try working on yourself for a while with a meditation program. Later on, you should try again to summon a Demon. Awareness is also important as well. Look for coincidences or answers to your questions and concerns. Do not limit yourself, as answers can come from many different sources and in some of the most unusual ways one would never expect. If you tried summoning for several times with no luck, you need to meditate regularly. Every Spiritual Satanist should meditate on a regular basis, regardless of present ability. 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Daemon So much has been distorted, warped and perverted by enemy religions. Here is the original meaning of Daemon/Demon- Daemon: \"In Greek myth, an intermediate spirit between men and Gods. Daemons such as the one who guided Socrates act as councilors and guardians to human beings.\" Another defintion: Demon and daemon were once used interchangeably. The former came to English from medieval Latin, while the latter was from classical Latin. The earliest use appears to have been in the phrase daemon of Socrates, which was his \"attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; genius\". That was in the late 14th century. It was a short time later that the term demon came to refer to \"an evil spirit\" by influence of its usage in various versions of the Bible. The Greek form was used to translate Hebrew words for \"lords, idols\" and \"hairy ones (satyrs)\". Wyclif translated it from Greek to English fiend or devil. This is how the evil connotation arose. By the late 16th century, the general supernatural meaning was being distinguished with the spelling daemon, while the evil meaning remained demon. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Magickal Evocation and Invocation There are basically two ways of summoning an entity or working with energy: \"Evocation\" and \"Invocation.\" Spiritual evocation is summoning an entity whether it be a Demon, spirit, deceased person, or elemental and the being appears outside of the operator. When working with energy, the energy is always on the outside of the operator and never inside his/her body. With evocation, there is never a direct tie or connection. Invocation is taking the spirit into one’s self. The being actually enters the operator’s body. An example is invoking a Demon and the Demon speaks through the operator using his/her voice to communicate. Often when this happens, one’s voice may change, becoming deeper, raspy, or different in some way. During séances, often the medium is able to produce a substance called \"ectoplasm\" to provide a luminescent material in order for the evoked spirit to manifest itself visibly. This is a form of invocation as there is a direct connection with the spirit and the medium. There are many different beings. One thing I have learned is with Satan’s Demons, when they enter us; they never harm us in any way. We are always conscious and fully aware. When they are speaking through us, we are aware of what they are saying and rarely is anything ever forced. One doesn’t experience gaps or \"missing time\" as those who invoke angelic beings have. Angels often masquerade as Demons. There are entities that are NOT of Satan and when they are invited in (usually these are angels or related ilk) they will take over and cause harm to the person who invoked them and the individual will not have any memory of the event. They will have missing time and more than likely other lingering problems as well. Satan is the bringer of knowledge. He has no reason to cause anyone to forget something or have lapses in memory in order to hide something. People who dabble with angels and other astral entities of whom they are not familiar with can experience these problems, and then of course, through ignorance and foolishness they blame \"The Devil.\" Some Demons come around and like to play. One time when was at work, a coworker showed me a photo of his girlfriend. I felt a Demon enter me and he said to me \"go ahead.\" I began reading her. The co-worker was surprised at my accuracy. Of course, this was my Demon friend speaking through me. Most available texts on spells and magick, due to a lack of knowledge (spiritual and magickal knowledge was removed and obliterated by the Christian church), not only give wrongful instructions, but instructions that can also be very dangerous when working black magick, using death energy and other destructive forces. There is a great difference between evocation and invocation. When we invoke energy or spirits, we create a link to the energy or spirit through ourselves. Obviously, if one is using destructive or death energy, this can be very dangerous. Invocation also includes building up energy within one’s soul and discharging it through one’s aura and/or chakras. This creates a tie to the victim. Most black magick spells that go wrong do so because of errors on the part of the mage. There are other reasons for a black magick working going wrong such as the victim having a powerful aura that is able to deflect negative energy; the victim is under powerful spiritual protection (If one is under Satan’s protection, nothing can touch him/her) or bad timing on the part of the mage. There can be other reasons, but the above are the most common. Even white magick where healing is concerned can pose problems to the mage who invokes the energy before applying it. Any time energy is invoked, a powerful connection is established. Obviously, no one 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"in his/her right mind would want to connect with a disease. If the mage is working on money, personal power or some other positive application of energy, then invoking is desirable. This also goes for love spells and workings of lust. One must know the difference when working a spell, as ignorance or misapplication of the above can result in a spell backfiring or other undesirable outcomes. For Example- Evoking Death Energy: The advanced mage should be familiar with this energy. Death energy is prevalent in mortuaries, cemeteries, places where wars were fought, where massacres occurred and other places of death. The energy is grey, dismal, and depressing. The mage should go into a trance, surround him/herself with the energy, but *NOT* take it into his/her body. The mage should direct the energy using his/her will and visualization into a ball or other form. The energy should be condensed tighter and tighter into the ball or form for power. The formed energy can then be expanded or contracted according to how the mage intends for it to be delivered to the victim. If delivering to the victim’s chakras, the energy should be tightly compacted, and exploded, or expanded upon entry into the victim's body. If the energy is to collect and adhere to the victim’s aura, the energy should be expanded to envelope the entire aura. Variations can be used according to one’s individual preferences. 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"FAQ About Demons I performed the ritual, but the Demon didn't show up Answer: I have gotten many e-mails from people who, after several attempts at summoning, the Demon finally appeared and after this, all summonings went fine. The reasons for this are one is new and/or not psychically open enough to sense the presence of the Demon. Persistence and patience pay off in results. Satan is strong on one having patience. How do I know if the Demon heard my summoning? Answer: Again, this is probably because you are new. Look for subtle signs like candles and/or incense flaring up, sizzling during the ritual, sometimes if you are open enough, the Demon will physically touch you. Demons often wait to come to us in our dreams. Objects can be moved, doors can be open or closed, breezes out of nowhere, feeling the Demon's energy and so forth. Just be open and aware. Look for coincidences. What if I can't find candles in the right color? Answer: Do the best you can to come as close to the color as you are able to. Because of xian control and pressure, many places where black candles and other colors used in Satanic rituals are sold are becoming scarce. Your desire and what is in your heart and mind are more important than the candle color. Can Demons be summoned only at night? Answer: The first time you summon, ideally, should be done at night. Nighttime is usually quiet and more conducive to psychic workings. The right (psychic) side of the brain is by nature more active during the hours of darkness. Once you establish a relationship with a Demon, you can summon him/her telepathically at any time by concentration alone, unless the Demon feels otherwise. He/she will let you know. If the Demon is busy, which is often the case; he/she may acknowledge you at a later time, usually within a day. Do I always have to perform a full ritual when summoning a Demon? Answer: No. After a relationship is established, just concentrating on the Demon and contacting him/her telepathically, with or without his/her sigil should be enough for him/her to show up anywhere or at anytime, provided you are extremely respectful and never demanding. Sometimes a Demon won't show if he/she has a reason, but will appear later. *When summoning an unfamiliar Demon, you should always perform a ritual. After summoning a Demon and having close contact/invoking, I felt achy, tingly, extremely powerful energy, etc. Answer: Demons have much greater amounts of bioelectricity than we humans do. Often close contact results in an excess of bioelectricity that remains with us after contact. Because our physical systems are not used to this, we may experience a heightened energy level and in some cases physical discomfort, for a short time after the Demon leaves. When we build up our own bioelectricity, we are able to handle more intense and intimate contact with Demons and not feel anything unsettling. 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Demons and Bioelectricity Demons have powerful energy, way beyond the average human. When we invoke them or have close intimate contact with them, a variety of effects can happen. The Demon's bioelectricity merges with our own. We are all individuals and our life force is individual, operating on different levels of intensity. What one person may experience, another may or may not. This depends on many different things, such as previous levels of the energy of our soul. The more powerful your own energy, the more energy you can withstand, with little or no unsettling effects. One’s present physical strength and constitution also determine the amount of energy we can handle. People who are built up or stronger physically can withstand more from their own workings or that from an outside source. People who do regular and intense physical exercise will find they are able to handle higher energy levels and progress faster in increasing their own bioelectricity. All of this takes time and patience. This is like climbing a mountain, where you have to camp at certain heights for a period of several days to a month or more, to acclimate yourself before moving upwards or otherwise experience some very unpleasant and sometimes life threatening effects such as severe altitude sickness. We are all individuals and must move at our own pace. Common sensations after invoking a Demon/ess are skin sensitivity, tingling, your insides vibrating or tingling; aching in the joints (for those with lower levels of bioelectricity), feeling like you are glowing and/or floating, sometimes anxiety, feeling heat or cold, exhilaration, intense dreams, feeling hyperactive or nervous, insomnia and others. The lower your own levels of life energy, the more effects you may experience. None of this is anything to be concerned about, as it will pass. The above also depends on the closeness of contact with the Demon/ess. Plain telepathic communication rarely produces the effects having sexual intercourse does. I invoked Demons several times and my skin tingled for a couple of days afterwards, feeling like a sunburn without the pain, just the sensitivity. Invoking Demons before sleep can cause insomnia, as the energy of the Demon/ess can keep you awake, as it is intense and powerful. With self-empowerment and increasing our own bioelectricity, we will always be able to feel a Demon and have some after effects, but they will be minimal as we become stronger. Feeling a kundalini surge when one is not meditating often indicates a Demon/ess is present. Demonic energy feels much like our own. This takes experience in determining whether a Demon/ess is present or whether we are just feeling our own energy. This comes in time and with repeated contact with the Demons. - High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Pantheon of Hell High Ranking Gods and Crowned Princes of Hell There are four great God powers who rule Hell; Satan, Beelzebub, Astaroth and Azazel.

Sippar was one of the first cities to be established by the Gods. \"Ellasar's Sumerian name is given as Ararwa, apparently for Arauruwa, 'light-abode,' which, in fact, is the meaning of the ideographic group with which it is written.

Like most of the principal cities of Babylonia, it had a great temple-tower, called E-dur-an-ki, 'house of the bond of heaven and earth.' The temple of the city bore the same name as that at Sippar, i.e. E- babbar, 'House of Light,' where the sun-god Samas was worshipped.

The name is commonly explained “Lord of Flies.” True, there is no Semitic analogy for this but Pausanias tells us of a God who drove away dangerous swarms of flies from Olympia, and Clement of Alexandria attests the cult of the same God in Elis and we may, if we will, interpret the title “A God who sends as well as removes a plague of flies.” Let us however, look farther. Bezold thought that in an Assyrian inscription of the 12th cent. B.C.E. “Baal-Zabnbi” was the name of the one of Zebub. Baal-Zebub was a widely known divine name, adopted for the God of Ekron. The restoration of the final syllable, however, is admittedly quite uncertain, and the reading Baal-Sapuna (see BAAL-ZEPHON, I) seems much more probable. Winckler, therefore, suggests that Zebub might be some very ancient name of a locality in Ekron (no longer to be explained etymologically), on the analogy of Baal-Sidon, Baal-Hermon, Baal- Lebanon. No such locality, however, is known, and Ekron, not any locality in Ekron, was the territory of the Baal. It is, therefore, more probable that Baal-Zebub, “Lord of Flies” (which occurs only in a very late narrative, one which has a pronounced didactic tendency), is a contemptuous uneuphonic Jewish modification of the true name, which was probably Baal-Zebul, “Lord of the High House This is a title such as any God with a fine temple might bear, and was probably not confined to the God of Ekron. “High house” would at the same time refer to the dwelling-place of the Gods “mountain of assembly” in the far North. There is some reason to think that the Phoenicians knew of such a dwelling-place. The conception is implied in the divine name Baal-Saphon, 'Lord of the North' (see BAAL-ZEPHON), and in the Elegy on the king of Tyre (Ezekiel 28 ) ; and the Philistines probably knew of it. At any rate, the late Hebrew narrator or, if we will, an early scribe may have resented the application of such a title as '”Lord of the high house” (which suggested to him either Solomon's temple or the heavenly dwelling of Yahwi, to the Ekronite God, and changed it to “Lord of flies,” Baal- Zebub.

In Egypt that tree was the palm-tree; in Rome it was the fir; the palm-tree denoting the Pagan Messiah, as Baal-Tamar, the fir referring to him as Baal-Berith.\"¹ \"The Christmas-tree, as has been stated, was generally at Rome a different tree, even the fir; but the very same idea as was implied in the palm-tree was implied in the Christmas-fir; for that covertly symbolised the new-born God as Baal-Berith, \"Lord of the Covenant,\" and thus shadowed forth the perpetuity and everlasting nature of his power, not that after having fallen before his enemies, he had risen triumphant over them all.\" ² 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" In Egypt they worshipped Nimrod as a palm tree, referring to him as the Messiah \"Baal-Tamar.\" Among the most ancient of Baals, he was known as Baal-Bereth, “Lord of the fir-tree.” He evolved into Baal-Berith, “Lord of the Covenant.” In Ancient Rome, where they also worshiped the fir tree, they called him \"Baal-Berith.\" The 25th of December, was observed in Rome as the day when the victorious God reappeared on earth, and was held at the Natalis invicti solis, \"The birth-day of the unconquered Sun.\" Now the Yule Log represents the dead stock of Nimrod, known as the Sun-God, but cut down by his enemies; the xmas- tree represents Nimrod- the slain God reborn. The ancient practice of kissing under the mistletoe bough, most common to the Druids, was derived from Babylon, and was a representation of the Messiah, \"The man the branch.\" The mistletoe was regarded as a divine branch --a branch that came from heaven, and grew upon a tree that sprung out of the earth. Nimrod, the God of nature, was symbolized by a great tree. But having been cut down and killed in his prime, he was now symbolized as a branchless tree stump, called the Yule Log. Then the great serpent came and wrapped itself around Nimrod (the stump). Miraculously, a new tree appeared at the side of the stump, which symbolized Nimrod’s resurrection and victory over death.

The Temple of Baal-Berith had a treasury from which the citizens made a contribution to Abimelech. It was there that Gaal first came forward as a leader of the rebellion, and within its precinct the inhabitants of the tower of Shechem (the 'acropolis,') found a temporary refuge from Abimelech at the close of the revolt.\"³ \"Baal-Berith was also known as \"God of the Community.\" Below are photographs of the ancient remiains of Baal-Berith's Temple: 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" The remains of Temple of Baal-Berith are a round-ended, land-filled platform on which a massive temple once stood.

It had one entrance to the east, in the middle of which was a column to support a roof, and on each side of the entrance was a massive tower. The eastern tower included a stairway that might have led to the second floor. Inside the main hall were two rows of columns. On the semi-circular platform in front of the temple, part of a sacred pillar or standing stone was found (seen on the right side of the above photo), Archaeologists believe it marked the temple entrance.\" BIFRONS • Zodiac Position: 15- 19 degrees of Scorpio • November 7th-12th • Tarot Card: 6 of Cups • Candle color: Light purple • Plant: Basil • Planet: Jupiter/Neptune • Metal: Tin/Neptunium • Element of Water • Rank: Earl • Bifrons is a Night Demon and governs 60 legions of spirits Bifrons teaches astrology, geometry, mathematics and other arts and sciences 141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"He reveals the values of herbs, woods and stones He can move corpses magically and coerce spirits of the dead to assist in magick, and/or to answer inquiries.

High Priest Salem Burke relates his experience with Shax: Shax is a good Demon. He has a totally good \"work ethic\", and will do a task specifically very enthusiastically.

But he walks along \"pointed\" angles with great ease -- something Goetic Demons do not tend to like. If you ask him several questions he will totally ignore the ones not related to the task at hand (i.e. love, etc. during an attempt to get a promotion), and not for any other reason than because his energy will be uselessly diminished. This is likely because (judging form his character) he is accustomed to \"human interaction\" -- he is a people Demon (but still a professional, and a good capable one, seriously -- he packs a good punch), and works immediately to fulfill the dominant and most likely task -- usually and in my case about money, and/or about catching a thief. Japs snatched my ATM card, and Shax had him locked away in a matter of minutes, just like he said. I have no doubt as to his answers, he answers quickly and accurately, and would not be the sort of Demon anyone would wish to cross. He is very powerful -- his residual energy was very helpful. Inevitably my innermost concern became for Japs. I asked Shax once, \"You will make absolutely sure you do not terrify him, or cause him permanent harm -- scare him -- and by this I do not mean like the others (as one is disfigured and the other paralyzed -- long time ago)?\" He answered very quickly and confidently, and powerfully. He said Japs would call me but would not admit it -- and that he had been restrained. Now Japs steals cars like I take taxis, and has never been busted for a GTA. Until, of course -- now.

These are the Demons with the glowing red eyes, rubbery wings and some even have fur. Up close, many of these Demons have the most beautiful eyes, like glowing rubies, deep and rich in color. They are originally from different planets, but many live with Father Satan and the other Demons. Pazuzu The lesser Demons are protectors, such as the Sumerian Demon, Pazuzu who is a protector of children and also women in childbirth. Pazuzu got a bad rap in the 1973 movie \"The Exorcist\" written by Catholic \"William Peter Blatty.\" This was the Christian retaliation against the 1968 movie \"Rosemary's Baby\" which depicted Satan in a positive perspective. \"The Exorcist,\" frightened many away from Satan and pushed the belief in Demonic \"possession.\" AGAIN, fear is used as a powerful tool to keep people spiritually enslaved and ignorant. Unlike the Christian \"God\" and his ilk, Satan and his Demons do not use coercion, nor do they push themselves upon anyone. Satan respects free will and people come to him willingly, not through fear or use of force. Many of us have invoked Demons (let them inhabit our bodies) and let them speak through us; no harm has ever come to anyone. Angelic beings on the other hand are notorious for this sort of thing and of course, like everything else, it is blamed on Satan. Bes Bes is another example of a lesser Demon.

I prefer to work the board alone, as another person is a distraction and prevents any real intimacy with the spirit contact. For those of you who are new to this, make sure the board is on a completely level surface. It is important to enter into a trance when using a ouija board. Place your fingertips lightly on each side of the planchette. Soon it will gently begin to pull. Just relax and let it work. It can take a few minutes to get going. It is important to be free from distractions and not to be disturbed. My experience is I sort of go into a trance. Like when scrying or invoking spirits of the deceased, everything else in the room is blocked out. My total focus is on the board. It is sort of like an aura around all of the edges of the board and my attention is completely locked in and nothing else outside of me, exists. This is just my own experience, we are all individuals, so some of yours may be different. I am finding more and more, the higher ranking the Demon, the more energy you will feel. I have a Demon who is close to me and last night I conversed with him, using the board. I don't remember how long I was using the board. This was for quite a while. He asked me to say something specific out loud. When I did, I really felt powerful energy light up lke a flame inside of me. When we have very close contact or invoke Demons, we can feel their energy. My skin still feels sensitized, like when I have a fever or sunburn, only no pain, even this morning. Their energy is electrifying. Father's energy is different, as I'm sure many of you have experiencd during and after rituals. Calming and beautiful. Demons come to us through telepathy and astral projection. It is my experience that Demons project differently than humans. With humans, you can see the connecting strands and when they leave, they snap back out quickly. Books say they are silver colored. The ones I saw were copper. I have never seen strands with Demons, but I know the higher ranking ones physically exist in another world. There are some Demons who can stay with us at all times, to protect us. These Demons are lesser as they are in spirit form. The more you use a Ouija Board, the better you will become in working it. When we establish a close relationship with a Demon, all we have to do is tune into them and they will usually come to us. Each of us is individual and will have slightly different experiences in using a ouija board and receiving messages: 1. The automatic method - In this case, the planchette moves automatically, without the operator knowing what the spirit concerned is going to say. Messages in foreign languages will also be received, even in languages the operator does not know and has never heard before. 2. The inspirational method - this is the most common: here the messages will be given in a sort of thinking aloud inside or outside one's mind. In this case, one practically knows beforehand what the spirit is about to write. By frequent repetition this inspiration will become a loud thinking and listening in the passive communication. One will perceive messages from the one's mind or from outside of the self. This is sort of like dictation- the words come into your head and then your hands move the planchette. 3. The intuitive method - where you have the feeling as if you moved the planchette yourself. Any 191"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"questions will be answered instantly. This is a kind of clair-knowledge. The planchette spells out words and sentences in full consciousness, without the operator hearing anything or being inspired in any way. The methods also can appear in a mixed kind, for example half automatic and half inspirational or intuitive and inspirational or all together. Which of the methods will be the dominant one will only be known after a long period of exercising. Each of the methods is good and reliable, provided you are using it honestly and candidly.

I do not believe in telling others how to think or what they should or how they should believe, this is up to the individual, but one important thing everyone should be aware of is- Satanism is very different from other religions. Satanism is different in that it does not mix. Mixing Satanism and Christianity for example is like mixing water with electricity. I have seen and read accounts where certain people who had an interest in Satanism, still had sympathies with Christianity. There were still strong unconscious ties to the Christian religion, most resulting from intense indoctrination. Most of us come from Christian backgrounds and for many there are lingering issues and hang-ups. Christian programming is very intense and given the extremely large amounts of psychic energy that have gone into it through centuries of Christian prayers and belief, there is a lot of power one must overcome to be totally free. People who are uncertain of their beliefs and who still have strong ties to Christianity or other related religions, either consciously, or in many cases subconsciously, are setting themselves up for some very frightening and negative psychic experiences. Calling upon Demons and going deep into the occult can bring up some very unexpected negative encounters for dabblers. This is the work of enemy alien entities that use fear to keep humans away Satan. In most cases this works, as it instills terror in the dabbler and he/she usually goes running back to the nazarene and blames Satan. I strongly suggest those who wish to go this far, first become strong in Satan. Very, very few, if any, progress in power unless they have a powerful protector. When one who is serious in developing the powers of the mind advances to any formidable level, or has any serious ability, he/she will be approached by powerful entities asking him/her to take sides in the spiritual war. The truly gifted who walk alone usually don’t live very long on this earth without the protection of a higher power. I feel it is important to warn those who are undecided or lukewarm to stay away from calling up Demons or trying to contact spirit entities until they are spiritually ready. Everyone is welcome here, from the dedicated to the curious. Knowledge should be open and available for everyone. There are some things, though that are advanced and one should wait before getting involved in these practices. At some point, it is a very important step in Satanism to cut all ties with any and all other religions. To avoid doing this is inviting disaster. This must be done from the soul in that there should be no indecision or mixed feelings. If there are mixed feelings, then one should wait, as this is a permanent step. For those of you who have already performed dedication rituals, you are fine. You can get into the advanced practices, but it is still important to deprogram yourself from any Christian teachings. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Using a Pendulum Pendulum Practice: Everything takes practice, patience, and above all persistence, in the psychic realm. Most pendulum adepts have worked with their pendulums for years. When one is advanced, a pendulum can reveal practically anything. For those of you who are serious about becoming proficient with a pendulum, I suggest you start out with asking the pendulum several unimportant questions at the beginning of your day, questions that pertain to events you know will occur during your day. For example: Will it rain today? Will I receive money today? Will I get off from work early today? Ask easy questions that are not of any great importance, as emotions and desires very much affect the answers we receive and this is where inaccuracy can step in. Record the questions in your black book/book of shadows/journal. At the end of your day go through each question and write the answer and note whether the pendulum was accurate or not. You can also use your pendulum for finding lost or misplaced items. Always record the accuracy in your black book. After several months, you should notice a lot of improvement in your accuracy. If you want to advance further, try asking the pendulum questions using a map. When recording your work in your black book, it is often helpful to note the time of day, the moon phase, the weather and other phenomena. For ladies, including your time in your menstrual cycle is also very important. I have found this affects us more than most are aware of as it has to do with the moon. Remember, it is always important to be as relaxed as possible when working with a pendulum as to access the right/psychic side of your brain, which operates through the pendulum. Using the Pendulum: Sometimes, we need easy answers to things. A pendulum is usually accurate, easy to use and takes little time. Begin by taking something like a small crystal, pendent, ring or other small lightly weighted object and attaching it to a necklace chain, string, ribbon, or some other kind of strand. This should be only kept for divination purposes and not for other uses. Hold the strand with your fingertips and let the weighted part hang. For those who are new and or inexperienced with using a pendulum, it is a good idea to place yourself into a trance when working with a pendulum. Once you are confident in obtaining correct answers, you no longer need to be in the trance state. Now ask a question you know the answer to, like what day it is. Start out by asking yes or no questions. See what the pendulum does and get a feel for it. I have found swinging right/left, like shaking ones head to imply no, means no and forward/backward like a nodding of the head means yes. When it goes in circles, the answer is uncertain. The wider the swing of the pendulum, the more accurate the answer. Pendulums can also be asked questions regarding how much, how many. The pendulum will swing, stop, swing again, and continue to do so a number of times before it completely stops. For finding lost items, take the pendulum around the area and ask it if you are near the lost item. Spirits can also communicate to us through pendulums. We can concentrate and focus on the name of the spirit 194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"or Demon we wish to contact. The pendulum is an excellent way to communicate with Demons. With Demons, the pendulum can be placed over a drawing of or copy of the sigil and asked questions. THE VARIOUS USES FOR A PENDULUM: Pendulums are an excellent means for communicating with the spirit world, checking the accuracy of other readings and divinations and many other different things. TO FIND SOMETHING LOST: In a Room - hold the pendulum and ask where the object is located. The pendulum will swing in the direction of the lost object. In a House - Ask the pendulum, room by room, i.e., is it in the kitchen? yes/no, bathroom and so on until you narrow it down. Then go into the room and section it off. On a Map - Start by asking if the missing person or object is in the area of the map. (For missing persons, it is helpful to have a photo and an item he or she has touched or worn). Hold the pendulum in the hand you normally use to divine with it and a pointer or pencil in the other. Point to places on the map, until you arrow it down and go from there. Outside: Ask - \"Am I facing the right direction to find... If the pendulum swings foreword or backward, you are moving in the right direction. In circles, move with the circle slowly, until it swings foreword and backward. You can also draw a floor plan of a house or building and ue the map method. OUTDOOR RITUAL SITES: Try using a map at first to pinpoint a good area. Places where Ley Lines and other energies on the Earth grid intersect, are powerful spots to perform all kinds of rituals. The pendulum will circle so fast when positioned over these areas, it will nearly be parallel to the Earth. The stronger the energies, the faster the pendulum will spin. PAST LIVES: You can write dates on separate small pieces of paper or cards and space them out, evenly on a table. Ask about your past life and the pendulum will swing in the direction of the paper with the accurate date. You can keep going back this way in time. You can do the same with continents, narrow it down to countries in which you lived. People you now know and their relationship to you in a past life. Put on separate pieces of paper- lover, friend, spouse, family member and so on. Name the person and ask the question. HEALTH: Ask about each area of your body or ask the aura of someone you want to know about. Keep narrowing down the questions with each answer you receive from the pendulum. GAMBLING: Be careful here, as mistakes can be costly, but you can take the pendulum to a casino and ask if this is a table or slot machine, you can win big at quickly and easily. The same can be done when betting on horses and so on. *It pays to be real experienced before you start going for the money. RELATIONSHIPS: A pendulum can tell you all sorts of things about other people. A photo or personal item of the person in question is a big help, but is not necessary. Just hold the pendulum over the item and ask questions. PLACES TO GO TO SHOP OR GET REPAIRS DONE: Just open the phone book and ask where is the most inexpensive and the best quality place for what you 195"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"want. Name places and the pendulum will answer yes/no. A pendulum can also be helpful in diagnosing car trouble before pulling everything apart or taking it to a shop. RITUALS: Ask what kind of incense to burn, the best time to perform the ritual, the best place, candle colors and so on. DEMONS: For simple contact of a Demon, place the pendulum over the Sigil of the particular Demon and begin asking questions. TAROT CARDS: Lay out several Tarot Cards as possible answers to a question. Ask the question and the pendulum will begin swinging in the direction of the card with the answer, until a yes is reached when it is placed directly above the card. Any yes or no questions can be accurately answered with a pendulum. Small cards or papers with names of people, places or things can be lined up from left to right and the pendulum will start swinging in the direction of the card or piece of paper with the answer. The pendulum should swing widely, as this is a definite yes or no. Circles are uncertain and a small swing is not so sure. 196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Incubi and Succubi: Sexual Relations with Demons Spirit sex is real. It requires some psychic work in order to open your mind to senses not normally accessible to the average person, but the way to do this is much easier than with other methods and a lot more pleasureable. Demon friends and lovers are wonderful for those who are in prison or incarcerated in any way. Many of us have experienced actually being physically touched by a Demon. The feeling is just like that of being touched by a human hand. This can go much further into actual sexual intercourse and lovemaking. Sexual intercourse with a Demon is blissful ecstacy. Because Demons come to us in etherial/astral form, they are able to penetrate our bodies and stimulate areas not easily accessible by other humans. Male Demons have no trouble finding and stimulating the G-spot in their women partners. Female Demons can get right to the prostrate gland in their men, resulting in a full deep orgasm. HOW TO BEGIN: First off, it is important to perform a ritual to Father Satan, stating your needs, whether they be just sexual, a love/sexual relationship, an open relationship, where you are free to have other sexual partners without any jealousy on either side; be specific. Some Demons are monogamus, in that they only have one partner and this goes both ways. These Demons take monogamy VERY seriously and if a relationship is violated by a human being, the partner of the human being could in the worst of cases wind up dead. Demons are known like humans to become very jealous. If a human is in an empty marriage and is just having sex with their spouse out of a sense of duty, Demons can be very understanding regarding this and will often overlook it, provided, in monogamus sexual love relations, your Demon is always #1. Keep in mind, once a commitment is made it will last a lifetime and beyond, so don't take this lightly. Your Demon will remain monogamus, also. You should find a Demon who is compatable with you. Remember, if you want a free, open relationship where you are free to have other sex partners, you must specify this in ritual. After your ritual, YOU MUST BE RELAXED AND OPEN, more than likely, your Demon will come to you when you are lying down and relaxed in bed. This will feel like electrifying energy and like kundalini, it feels exhilerating. Now, for people that are new to this, to begin this and open up, just begin fantasizing about having intercourse with your Demon. Most Demons are very physically attractive as opposed to all of the trash written in the grimoires and the horror stories. Ask your Demon to show themselves to you. Relax, close your eyes and tune in. You should see an image of your Demon in your mind. Even if you can't, you can picture an ideal lover for an image your Demon can inhabit to start with. When you begin to fantasize and do this a number of times, your Demon will feel this on the astral and enjoy it as well. You can masturbate yourself to orgasm in the beginning, until a full physical manifestation takes over. When you do this, your Demon will have an orgasm, as well. This will take time so be patient and persistent. The fantasies, done night after night will begin to get much more vivid and before you know it, you will feel your Demon and even see your Demon as you would another human being. Your Demon will work with you to open your psychic channels, as opposed to just plain fantasizing on your own. 197"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Your Demon will more than likely come to you each night when you lie down to go to bed. Demons enjoy sex very much and they can wear out a human being. One man actually had to push a female Demoness off of himself in the morning in order to get up for work after having all night sex. She didn't want to stop. Pleasure is way beyond anything with a human being and spiritual sex can become addictive. Chances are, no longer will human sexual relationships be desired or satisfying. In addition, one does not have to worry about contracting sexually transmitted diseases or experiencing unwanted pregnancies. A Demon lover will also be protective of you. They are wonderful with listening to any worries, concerns or problems and are often helpful in punishing enemies and taking care of things for you. When the proper psychic channels are open, two-way conversations can take place. This is an enormous help in spiritual empowerment and advancement. They will tell you things, teach you and in some cases, even contact other Demons for you. Intense contact with Demons involves an energy exchange. The Demons, being on a higher spiritual level than humans have much more energy and extreme closeness can produce effects in us humans that feel like sunburned skin and/or oversensitivity, until we get used to this or advance our own energy levels, which is the goal of Spiritual Satanism. 198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Help from Gods When one is a newly dedicated Satanist, Demons will usually offer their assistance.

EVENTUALLY I CUT THE CIRCLE OUT. THE SECOND BOARD WAS “AUTO” CUT WITH AN EXACT-O KNIFE (PER AUTO-WRITING), AND CAME OUT IN A TRAPEZOIDAL SHAPE.\" \"I DO NOT RECOMMEND PLACING A CANDLE ANYWHERE ON THE ACTUAL BOARD. \" - High Priest Salem Burke A close friend of mine and myself were working a Ouija Board. She asked if there was a Guardian Demon for her. The planchette spelled out G-U-S-I-O-N. Later on, Gusion appeared to her in a dream. A couple of weeks later, I drew his sigil, we took it to the tattoo shop, and she had it tattooed on her arm. She has made some major improvements and things have been going well for her. My Demon is not a Goetic demon and I had some trouble finding his Sigil, but I found it and did the same. I also had his name tattooed on my arm under his sigil. We don't have to have tattoos to get in touch with our Guardian Demons. There are several methods for contact. One method is to use a Ouija Board. We don't have to have another person working a Ouija Board with us. I work my board alone most of the time. When there are two or even more people working a Ouija Board, this can create distractions and this can cause the board to give inaccurate answers. in addition, there are many times when one wishes to ask personal or private questions. This is best when done alone where one can relax into a trance, which is so necessary for operating a Ouija Board. When I was new, my Demon first communicated through letters. U R (you are) C U (see you) for goodbye. This way, I definitely knew this was for real, as I expected words. Another interesting thing, I have the planet that he rules over, ruling my house of partnership. He also rules an astrological point and that planet is exactly on the point in the sign that he rules. This is not the norm, though as I found later that he and I were extremely close in a past life thousands of years ago. Another method of finding out who your Guardian Demon is, is to use a pendulum. You will need a decent pendulum and a wide mouthed glass jar. Start out by asking how many letters are in his or her name. The pendulum will start to circle, then stop, then circle again, then stop and again make circles until it completely stops. Count the number of times it makes circles and here you will have the number of letters in your Demon's name. Dangle the pendulum, holding it between your thumb and index finger in the glass jar, keeping your hand outside of and directly over the jar. Begin with the first letter and ask the pendulum if it is A, B, C and so on. When the pendulum hits the side of the glass jar, write down the letter and continue on to the next letter in his or her name, again going through the alphabet. Make sure you are completely relaxed and preferably in a trance for an accurate reading. Using a Ouija Board is also an excellent way of establishing contact and getting answers, especially for those who are new to Satanism. Those of us who are experienced normally communicate with our Demons telepathically. 200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"My Demon definitely wanted to make contact with me.

What is known as \"Satanism\" is humanity's original religion. The holidays listed below precede Christianity by hundreds to thousands of years. Because the Christian Church could not murder everyone, the original holidays were taken and Christianized in attempts to convert as many as possible. The fictitious nazarene has nothing to do with xmas. Xmas coincides with the Winter Solstice and the Yule season, the shortest day of the year. December 25th is the birthdate of the Persian God Mithra, and the Roman Holiday of Saturnalis. The tree, the decorations, baking, gifts and celebrating have NOTHING to do with the nazarene. These are carry-overs from original Pagan celebrations. \"Easter\" was stolen from Astaroth. Originally known as \"Ashtar.\" This holiday coincides with the Vernal Equinox of spring when day and night are of equal length. Known as \"Eastre\" to the Anglo- Saxons. As the Goddess of fertility, she was associated with rabbits and eggs. The Christians stole this holiday and twisted its meaning. Other names include: Easter, Eastre, Eos, Eostre, Ester, Estrus, (Estrus is when an animal goes into heat; mating season) Oestrus, Oistros, and Ostara. Again, the \"Lamb of 208"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"God\" was stolen from the Zodiac sign of Aries the Ram which occurs every spring. \"All Saint's Day\" corresponds with \"Halloween/Samhain.\" \"Assumption Day\" coincides with \"Lammas Day\" of the \"Summer Solstice.\" For more information see The New Testament and Christian Religion and Exposing Christianity YULE/WINTER SOLSTICE December 22nd-23rd Although the Solstice begins on the 21st-22nd of December, the 23rd is a very special Personal Day for Father. The Sun enters the sign of the Goat which represents Satan. The Night of December 22nd- the eve of December 23rd is the Highest Satanic Holy Night of the year. (This was dictated from him personally). It is the day after the longest night of the year. Again we look foreward to beginnings, as the days will begin to get longer as the year goes on. This is a time for intense celebration and devotion to Lord Satan. Indulgence, decorating the home, family celebrations and get togethers. The Night of Dec. 22nd should be spent in dedication to Satan. This is an excellent time to focus on planning for the year. If one wishes to make personal resolutions this is a good time to do so. At the high point of a ritual or offertory for a Black Mass, personal resolutions can be written on paper and burned. Father is always there to help us in having the strength to carry through with our intentons. After the rite, intense celebrating should take place. The Yule holidays for Satanists are times of indulgence and taking pleasure in the physical and material aspects of life. Actually, xmas trees and wreaths are Pagan in origin, so there is no reason not to celebrate this holiday with our families. Gift giving, baking, decorating. This is what the TRUE Yule season is about, not the filthy nazarene.

THIS TRASH COMES FROM XIANS. IT IS USED TO BLASPHEME, DENIGRATE AND RIDICULE HIM. THE SAME GOES FOR HIS DEMONS. For many of us, Halloween is a favorite holiday. I, myself love horror movies and such. The point here is how these have been twisted to portray a false and insulting image of Satan and the Original Gods (Now labeled as \"Demons\"). Ask yourself how you would feel if people put on hideous masks and went out as either you or a family member of yours or a loved one. Father Satan should be respected on this date, not mocked by those who believe in and honor whatever xianity dictates he is. How long do you think someone would last going out dressed as the nazarene? Chances are, they would be attacked by some fundie xian. Or, if Hollywood was to produce a movie depicting the nazarene and his ilk as hideous monsters. Halloween is a great time for costumes, monsters and ghouls, images of death and such. A time to be creative and indulge. It is one of our major holidays, but the negative images denigrating Father have to go. He is tired of it and has let the clergy know he does not approve of these insults. For far too long, too many Satanists have gone along with the XIAN ideas of Satan and his Demons; what the XIANS allege them to be and what THEY claim our religion is all about, instead of seeing Satan for WHO HE REALLY IS without all of the xian false and twisted overtones. ABOUT SAMHAIN: The holiday known as \"Halloween\" was originally called \"Samhain\" a Celtic word meaning \"Summer's End.\" In ancient times, religions were based upon nature, where humanity lived in tune with the earth, the change of seasons and the changes in the stars in the sky. This is the essence of Satanism; what is natural. The major cycles of the year and the crops were important times for festivities, rites and celebrations. Samhain was a time of harvest and the end of a year, a time of preparation; storing crops and preparing for the dead of winter. The eve of November 1st was the eve of the Celtic New Year. This holiday was a time of harvest, a time of endings, death and dying, as plant life died and the cold set in. Samhain was 210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"also a time of honoring the dead. The Druids built huge bonfires, which they considered sacred, in honor of the Celtic New Year. There was a prevailing belief in the existence of a Celtic God of the dead known as 'Samhain\". With extensive research and study accomplished by many scholars, nearly all agree this God was non- existent. Nearly all of the sources mentioning a diety of death known as \"Samhain\" are XIAN and they have (as usual) NO legitimate references to back up their claims. Samhain was celebrated for centuries before the xian takeover of Pagan holidays. To the intruding xian religion, any Gods of the old faith were considered \"evil\" and therefore especially unwelcome at a time of \"danger\" for the \"soul of any good parishioner.\" This was why xtians suppressed the deadly rite and replaced it a day later with 'all soul's day.'\" Trick or treating originated in Ireland as beggars went door to door on October 31st, asking for handouts. The gifts were for \"Muck Olla\" a God who was said to destroy the house of anyone who was not generous. Jack-O-Lanterns also had their origin in Ireland; named for a man named \"Jack.\" The story goes that Jack was a miser and when he died, he was not allowed into heaven and he also played jokes on the Devil, so he was not admitted into Hell either, but was doomed to walk the Earth forever. He only had a litle lantern to light his way and this is why he came to be called Jack-O-Lantern. Of course, the spooks, vampires and ghouls were associated with this holiday because of the natural human fear of death and Samhain was a holiday of death. 211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Satanic Rituals Standard Ritual Please read this entire page as there are explanations at the bottom. Satan/Lucifer represents the common people. Unlike the xian churches and all of their vast wealth, pomp, and ceremonial show, Satan does not expect his people to have expensive items for ritual. If all you have is yourself, this is fine with Satan. He understands. Satan, who is our True Creator God has given us everything we need within ourselves. Satan represents and stands for self-efficiency and personal empowerment to where we can control our own lives and destinies without having to slavishly worship or rely upon something outside of ourselves. Satan gives us the knowledge we need to access the power within. • It is a good idea to always bathe before ritual. This shows respect. • Light your incense and let it burn 10-15 minutes to fill the room. • Write any prayers, thanksgivings and/or requests out on clean paper • Light your candles. [If you are using candle holders, they should be silver] • Fill your chalice with wine or some other drink [your chalice should be silver] • Dress for ritual. If you don't have a ritual robe, try to wear all black, if possible. Make sure your clothes are clean. THE RITUAL Ring the bell, turning counterclockwise, invoke the Four Crowned Princes of Hell. You can do this with your athame [if you have one] OR just point your left index finger and visualize a stream of electric blue light entering the tip of your index finger and filling your entire being.

Begin with Satan/Lucifer, facing east and then turn to the north for Beelzebub, west for Astaroth, and south for Azazel, keep charging yourself with the blue energy at each turn: • SATAN/LUCIFER TO THE EAST • BEELZEBUB TO THE NORTH • ASTAROTH TO THE WEST • AZAZEL TO THE SOUTH 212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Then, recite the Invocation to Satan: INVOCATION TO SATAN: In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas, Luciferi Excelsi.

At the end of your ritual close with a HAIL SATAN!! Turn clockwise and ring the bell. *Due to the monetary and political control of the xtian church, places where black candles can be purchased are becoming scarce. For those of you who are unable to find black candles, there is an alternative. Lucifer's color is blue. Electric blue. Demons also show up in a blue aura. Those of us who have seen Hell, agree that it has a blue aura. USE BLUE. For black magick spells, use red (anger) or navy blue (blue or black) Dark brown works well, also. This is just an attempt by xtians to try to stop us from practicing our religion, and is especially targeted towards teenagers and young people. Satan understands this and alternatives are alright with him. For kids and teens who are unable to obtain any ritual items and for those who are financially underprivilaged, the ritual can be performed in Your own private Astral Temple *\"Prayer\" in Satanism is very different from what the populace has been indoctrinated to believe, given the xians and other enemy programs. Satanic \"Prayer\" is: 1. Telepathic communication between ourself and Satan and/or his Demons 2. Another aspect of Satanic Prayer is vibrating a mantra, word/s of power, Enochian or the Runes.

Fold the paper loosly. Light a tip of the paper in the flame of one of your candles and place it in the burning bowl to burn. During this time, meditate on everything Father has done for you. Open your heart, let Father feel your gratitude and love. Take as long as you like.

Adepts use more techniques that are advanced and in many cases, a formal ritual is not needed. The strength of your mind, aura, will, focus, and hatred determine the outcome of any destruction ritual. When one is new, Satan and his Demons often grant favors, but the essence of true Satanism is self-empowerment. The Destruction Ritual begins with the Standard Ritual. After invoking the Four Crowned Princes of Hell, you should read a prayer that you have written by yourself in your own words asking for the destruction of your enemy. Work on only one enemy at a time, unless you have a specific agreement with a Demon/ess in exchange for services you both agree upon. Attempting to punish more than one enemy at a time will only weaken your energies, as they will be dispersed. Energy should be directed like a laser to do its job. Included in the prayer should be the name of the offending one, the severity of the punishment you wish to see inflicted, and how they offended you and your feelings about being victimized. It also helps to have either a small personal possession of the offender's or a photo of them, but is not necessary. Either read the prayer aloud or silently to yourself, then push the tip of your athame through the paper and light it with the flame of one of your candles and place it in the burning bowl. Now this next step is extremely important. The following is a good cathartic that can be a lifesaver to one's mental health and psychological well-being. This is the meditation step and is highly recommended in cases where there is an extreme amount of pent up anger and hatred: Here is where you visualize the person as clearly as you can and just let loose until total exhaustion. This ritual is best done while the offender is sleeping. Visualize the offender clearly and inflict all of the mutilation, injury, and pain you can imagine upon them. Beat them, stab them, torture them, and torment them. You can repeatedly recite their name over and over again in your mind. Release all of your hatred and anger in any way you wish. Just do it in your mind. Some people hate someone so hard they cry- this is fine, this is a cathartic and a very intensely emotional release. You must continue on and on until you are literally exhausted. T he most important thing here is to stay focused. You should also feel very justified. Any lapse in concentration or feelings that creep in where you feel you are not 100% in the right and completely may not only destroy a destruction ritual, but can be dangerous. Now, close the ritual by giving thanks to Satan and any Demons you may have called forth that the offender will be rightfully punished. Ring the Bell, turning clockwise and say HAIL SATAN!! Either silently to yourself or aloud. Take the burned remains and you can flush them down the toilet or dispose of them in some other degrading manner. NOW THIS STEP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Take all of the time you need with this and then some. You have just dealt with some very negative and destructive energy. You should clean your aura and chakras. This is done by continuously placing a white light or cleansing fire around your aura to clean and burn off negative energy residue. Then proceed to place the light or fire around each of your chakras one by one. Then proceed to spin your chakras- say to yourself \"speed of light\" for each one. See it spinning until it turns a brilliant white like the Sun. Stand up and visualize a flat disk like table surface above your head, shining a brilliant white. 219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The surface will descend upon your head and all the way down through your body and past the bottoms of your feet, pushing and expelling any negative residue from your being. Repeat this exercise at least two times. You should also keep cleaning your aura for several days following the working. It is important that you put the experience behind you and do not dwell on the offender or concern yourself with hopeful anticipation over their punishment. Let the working do its job. Banish the offender and the incident from your thoughts. This working can take up to a month or more. **The ritual can be varied, using a POPPET 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Banishing Ritual A banishing ritual should be done on a Saturday when the Moon is waning. Use a standard ritual and write on a piece of paper asking Satan to bless the area. Place the sigils of Flauros (Havres, Haures) and Orobas on your altar during the ritual. These two Demons work to keep unwanted spirits out. Ask that they be blessed and empowered, and for Satan to send these Demons to you to protect your area. When you burn the paper, meditate strongly and imagine a strong electric blue light, like a flame, run it along the ceiling, in the corners, down the walls and the floor. If you can get your friends to help in the ritual, your combined power will really do the job. Everyone should focus the blue light. Thank Satan and the Powers of Hell for blessing your area. Make sure the sigils are well protected. I put mine in a CD case. Any spirits or negative energies in the area should be banished.

This ritual is extremely powerful. The ritual is based upon what is called a \"niding pole.\" Centuries ago, people in the Northlands raised niding poles against the invading xian clerics and missionaries. The pole acts as a magnet for earth energies that are used to continually deliver curses at the selected victim. Runes are of the most ancient symbols and have incredible power. The runic symbols can be seen in Ancient Phoenician letters which are based upon the constellations. The TH runes destroy the spirit and the I runes bind the destruction. This ritual can also be used to vent at local churches and xians. Do *not* place the pole on church property, though as this is illegal. It is best if the pole is in view of the home or building of the recipient of the intended curse, but not necessary. Just make sure it is in an isolated and secure area where it will not be disturbed. 225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Truth Concerning the “Shemhamphorash” There are many Satanists who mistakenly believe \"shemhamephorash or its variant spelling \"shemhameforash\"\" is \"Hail Satan.\" This is stupidity. The word \"Shemhamephorash\" is not Satanic. \"Shem,\" \"Ham\" and \"Japheth\" were sons of the biblical \"Noah.\" Any idiot can see the connection. Genesis 5: 32 gives Noah's sons in the exact order as the wording of the \"Shemhamphorash.\" \" And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\" (Taken from the King James version). Like everything else in the bible, the story of \"Ziusudra\" was stolen, corrupted and with this corruption, the name \"Noah\" replaced \"Ziusudra.\" The name \"Noah\" is false and represents the enemy \"god.\" Also, we can see this is another \"trinity.\" \"Shemhamephorash\" \"The 72 part name of God.\" A divine name of 216 letters derived from Exodus 14: 19-21. Each of the three verses used contains 72 letters which are then arranged in boustrophedon to produce the 72 syllables of the name.\"¹ Shemhamephorash was eventually condensed to YHWH- the tetragrammaton*- meaning the judeo/xtian \"god.\" 14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. To obtain the name- the three verses are written in Hebrew with alternating lines in opposite directions, giving 72 columns of 3 letters each. These 72 three letter names are regarded to amplify the powers of the tetragrammaton and are divided into four groups of 18, each division ruled by one of the four letters of the name YHVH.² Coming from the Hebrew rabbis: Hebrew for tetragrammaton, which in Greek means \"the four letters\"; YHVH- those constituting the mystic name of God.\"³ The name of \"god\" in the jewish religion is deemed so holy and sacred, it is not to be spoken and it is kept secret. Its pronunciation is considered in the jewish tradition to be an unforgivable sacrilege. YHVH- the English equivalent of the Hebrew letters Yod He Vau He. Outside of the temple, it is pronounced \"Adonai\" (Adoshem-'my lord'). 4 Xtians, most of whom have an inadequate knowledge of hebrew punctuation and vowel phonetics, substituted for it, beginning with the year 1518, a distorted form of yahveh; namely \"jehova.\" 5 Other aliases of this \"god\" include: • When he sits in judgement on the human race: \"Elohim\" • When he \"wars\" on evildoers: \"Zebaot\" • When he recalls man's sins: \"El Shaddai\" • My lord: \"Adonai\" • Most High God: \"El Elion\" 226"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"• Creator: \"Ha-Boreh\" • God of Israel: \"Elohe Yisrael\" • God the strong one/God the hero: \"El Ha-Gibbor • Yaweh, the god of armies (in English- the lord of hosts): Yahveh Elohai Zebaot • Holy one of Israel: Tsur Yisrael • The place (omnipresent): Ha-Makom • Infinite one of the kabbalah: \"En Sof\" *The tetragrammaton is the \"holy ineffible\" name of the xtian \"god.\" YHVH also yaweh, jehova. The name YHVH literally menas \"he is.\" 6 The reason I have gone into so much detail is people need to get educated about this. KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BEFORE YOU SAY IT! Instead of saying \"Hail Satan\" one is, when saying \"shemhamephorash,\" saying \"hail yaweh.\" \"Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.\" 227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Enochian Explanation Most Satanists know the Enochian Keys through the Satanic Bible, written by Anton Szandor LaVey. Many use the keys during ritual and in prayer. Unbeknownst to most people, Anton LaVey never revised the keys in Enochian, though he changed the English words in most, but not all of them, to conform to Satanism. For example: Asha, Baeovib, Gahoachma, Iabes, Iad, Iadpil, Iadapiel, Iadanahe, Iaida, Iaidon, Idoian, Idoigo, Ioiad, L, Mad, Mada, Oiad, Piad, Zilodarp, Zirenaiad and many more are all the names/aliases of yaweh/jehova. These names are entirely left intact throughout the Satanic Bible in Enochian. So unbeknownst to most Satanists, reciting these keys in Enochian, one is praising and praying to the xian god. There are also several of the keys LaVey did not bother to alter in English. For example: The Fifth Key, page 186; at the end \"Our Lord and Master is the All-One!\" This is an alias of jehova \"the all one.\" Satan's number is TWO. Page 192, bottom of the page: \"and the praise of your God in your creation.\" This is rather blatant. This has never been changed from the original calls and in Enochian, guess what it says? It sure does not imply Lord Satan in any way, shape or form. Page 204, the Eighth Key is very blasphemous: \"the dragon doth sink\" The Dragon is a sacred symbol of Satan and symbolizes the spiritual power (kundalini) within us all. Page 252, \"the God of stretch forth and conquer\" is not Satan, but jehova. This is obvious in both the xian bible, where he personally directed the mass murder of millions with his bloody rampage following the encounter with the Hebrews in the desert. Zilodarp is his name in Enochian and is translated into \"the god of stretch forth and conquer.\" Page 258, \"whose God is wrath in anger\" everyone familiar with xianity knows about the \"wrathful\" xian god who is forever punishing and throwing curses at humanity. Nearly every key in Enochian, LaVey left as is. The Enochian keys were taken from the original Enochian calls. These 19 calls are intended to bring upon the Apocalypse/Armageddon and ensure the victory of the yaweh/jehova aliens and their ilk. Left as is, they are nothing more than praises to jehova and insulting blasphemies to Lord Satan. The keys on this website have been revised BOTH in English and in Enochian and reworded to blaspheme yaweh/jehova and praise Satan and ensure HIS victory. The keys contain words of power, especially when recited in Enochian. Given the revisions and the experiences that several of us have had with them, the JoS Ministry strongly advises any who uses these keys in ritual or in prayer, to have already performed the dedication ritual as they may otherwise be dangerous for the uninitiated. To further add to the blasphemies against Satan with the keys in the Satanic Bible; the book \"The 228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Goetia; The Lesser Key of Solomon the King; Clavicula Salomonis Regis; translated by Samuel Liddell and MacGregor Mathers; edited with an introduction by Aleister Crowley; illustrated second edition\" © 1995, pp 97- 124 contains the petitions to yaweh/jehova and the enemy angels used to threaten and coerce the Demons of Satan into a triangle using a nine foot circle and all of the enemy props, all translated into Enochian. All of the Enochian names of yaweh/jehova are contained therein. The Enochian names of this enemy alien god, used to abuse the Demons and blaspheme Satan are all intact within the Satanic Bible; praising him. Due to the length and effort that has gone into this project, I will not go into the details concerning the angelic visitations to Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly who received the original translations from angels. I provided links for further study below. In closing, I am aware of many people who mistakenly believe that Dee and Kelly were not visited by angels, but Demons. After studying the background in depth and having experienced revising the Enochian Keys, I am thoroughly convinced beyond any doubt; the visitors were not Demons, but angels. I met with incessant obstacles while working on the keys and the worst of the problems came with the keys that contained the curses directed against jehova. I had inexplicable bad luck, power outages with no explanation that required me to redo work I had previously finished, computer problems, and many other unusual occurrences of a very negative nature. Others who are close to me and clergy members were affected as well. Father Satan came to visit me a couple of times during the revisions and told me he was very pleased and this was long overdue. He also stated that most of us are unaware of the power of the keys. Enochian is angel magick; used to summon angels. Below are links for further study as to the background. I posted these are for educational purposes only.

The course of her, let it run with pleasure, And as a handmaid let her serve Satan. One Season, let it confound another; and let there be no Creature upon or within her the same. All her members, let them differ in their qualities; And let there be no one creature equal with Another. The reasonable creatures of the Earth, Let them vex and weed out one another; and the Dwelling places. The works of the followers of Jehova and his pomp, let them be defaced. The buildings of he who sits on the holy throne, Let them become caves for the beasts of the field; Their iniquities shall be known. For why? I regret Their creation.

Out of control, emotions can be detrimental to one’s health and well-being, and at worst can be lethal. In a situation where panic takes control and gives way to terror, where fear is completely out of control; one can freeze up when immediate action is called for and wind up dead. Out of control, emotions interfere with and even prevent rational thought. Here the panic/terror takes over one’s entire being. Control of emotions and having a calm mind can mean the difference between life and death. Worry does nothing to change a problem. It drains energy and can cause serious health problems. Again, the mind is out of control, as the same thoughts compulsively repeat themselves over and over, accomplishing nothing but upset. Bad situations and problems need to be rationally thought out for possible solutions and then let go. Constantly rehearsing a bad incident over and over isn’t going to solve the problem. This will only create other problems. Stress tears down the body and mind. Mental and psychological pain can be just as bad as physical pain. A strong mind can refuse this pain. When the mind is calm, often solutions will present themselves and problems can be worked out. We are also more open to the spirit world when we are calm, often we can find help here. If we calmly ask our mind for answers regarding a certain problem before we fall asleep at night, we will usually have answers when we awaken, or sometimes answers will come to us in a dream. Out of control emotions are the result of an out of control mind. Void meditation helps with detaching from negative emotions. When unwanted emotions arise, relaxing one’s mind and detaching one’s self from the feeling can be difficult at first, but with persistence, control can be established. Try softening around the emotion or focusing attention on the emotion/feeling, relaxing and letting go. Empty the mind. This can also be helpful in cases of depression. Focus on feeling calm and relaxing inside. When mastery over one’s emotions is established, (this can take years), being able to keep calm in crisis situations can prove invaluable and can be life saving. Animals will rarely, if ever attack someone who is not in any way afraid. Having a calm orderly and powerful mind comes from the regular practice of void meditation. This also strengthens our thought power for magickal practice. The next time you feel unwanted emotions; try to focus on detaching and relaxing. This can be difficult at first, but will come with time. We must completely master ourselves, for this is the path to becoming a god. There are times when we have to just let go and vent. This can be done during a ritual. Father Satan always listens to us and sometimes it is a good thing to let it all out and get it all out, so that one can be at peace and not have to feel suppressed in any way. If extreme worry or other emotions cannot be brought under control, venting during a ritual is the often best way. Mastering one’s emotions, as well as the mind is something that needs to be worked on every day. In time, a sense of calm and confidence will take over and remain, so that the mind can be free for spiritual development and the fulfilling of one’s desires. Curses of the Gods Much has been publicized concerning the 1922 Tutankhamen discovery and the numerous and 262"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"mysterious deaths that were more than mere coincidences. Atheistic scholars are at a loss to come to a realistic explanation, as they are concerning the construction and design of the Egyptian Pyramids. When the tomb of Tutankhamen was opened in February of 1923, a clay tablet was discovered, written in hieroglyphics warning of the curse of a violent and untimely death, should one disturb the tomb. The archeologists ignored this warning and concealed it from the native Egyptian laborers. Strange and inexplicable occurrences soon followed. Howard Carter, the leader of the expedition, had along his pet canary. A cobra swallowed the bird the day the tomb was opened. Lord Carnarvon, a wealthy English Earl and financier of the expedition, soon fell ill with a high fever and a mysterious \"mosquito bite\" on his cheek. Forty-seven days after the opening of the tomb, at 57 years of age, on the date of April 5, Carnarvon died. Two days later, on April 7 (again, the number 7), the mummy was examined. A blemish was found on the mummy's left cheek (the same side and spot as Carnarvon's mosquito bite). At the time of Carnarvon's death, all of the lights mysteriously went out in Cairo, all in unison. At the same time, thousands of miles away in England, Carnarvon's pet dog stood up on its hind legs, howled, fell over, and died. The staff was disturbed and said the howling was strange and deathlike. The famous American financier, Jay Gould, also visited the tomb. He awoke the next morning with a high fever, and was dead by nightfall. American archeologist, Arthur Mace, who assisted in opening the tomb and pulled out the last stone blocking the entrance to the main chamber, soon began to feel weak and exhausted. He fell into a coma and never recovered. Arthur Mace died at the same hotel as Lord Carnarvon. Richard Bethell, Howard Carter's secretary on the expedition was found dead, four months after the discovery of the tomb, from heart failure. His father, Lord Westbury, distraught over the death of his son, leapt to his death from a seven-story window. He was over heard by several people before he took his life, saying to himself \"the curse of the pharaohs\" \"I cannot stand the horror any longer.\" The hearse carrying Westbury's body to the cemetery ran over a small boy, killing him instantly. Radiologist, Archibald Reid, thought to be the first person to cut the bindings on the mummy, (unraveling was necessary to x-ray the body), soon experienced the same exhaustion and fatigue and soon died. There were many more strange coincidences and related deaths. Howard Carter, a staunch atheist and skeptic lived for close to seventeen years following the discovery and opening of the tomb. It is said that Carter was plagued by extreme depression and paranoia. The Goetic/Gothic Demons- many are well known and popular Egyptian Gods. Many humans from Ancient Egypt, specially the Priesthood and the Pharaohs had immense spiritual knowledge and powers and did not approve of their tombs being dug up and exploited for money and fame in the hands of a \"chosen\" few. Many of the relics and ancient artifacts removed from the tombs were hoarded, placed in private collections and continue to bring their greedy owners misfortune. Where is Satan? I have received e-mails from several people who claim they cannot feel Father Satan in their lives. Here is something you can do: When you have some piece and quiet (I know how hard that can be for some of us) relax and think of all of the things that have happened in your life after you came to Father. Write them down in a journal, if you have to. 263"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"I personally keep a journal and write down everything Father has done for me. I do this for several purposes; one- I do many thanksgiving rituals and we humans are so quick to forget and two- whenever I am upset or feeling out of sorts, I turn to the journal to remind me of the positive and for inspiration. I usually have something to write every day. Getting back to the above, go over your life. Take a good look at the difference inside and out of where you are now, as compared to say whan you were an atheist, xtian, agnostic or whatever. See and note the difference. This is Father. Sometimes things aren't all that apparent, until we are aware of them. Last week I had an incident. I was searching for some info on the web. Now we all know this can be a road to nowhere. Obviously, I didn't find it. A Demon came in my head and told me to go to the drugstore, as I should look to a certain magazine. Needless to say, I was in a lousy mood (the whole day went bad). I thought I had more money in my checking account than I did. I called the automatic teller. I went to the drugstore, no magazine. I was running late to work, this was a Saturday night. To make a long story short, Father saved my ass. I had a bunch of checks out, small ones. When they all would have hit the bank, Monday, I would have had a huge sum in overdrafts due to my own mathematical errors (not paying attenion to detail while trying to do several things at once). Not only this, but I asked Father for money and I was given more than enough to cover the off amount and extra left over until pay day. Here is one of the many instances many call luck, but I know better. I thanked Father Satan in a ritual. He was looking out for me all along. I never would have called the bank, had I not gone to the drugstore. As for getting blown away after every ritual, it just doesn't always happen. We all know that beautiful ecstatic aura we have after most of our rituals, sometimes stronger, than at other times. All of us can become more aware of Father's workings n our lives. I recommend keeping a journal. Just becoming aware will open a door. Reverence and Respect I have learned much, directly from Satan and his Demons. Everything I posted on this website about contacting and establishing relationships with Demons came directly from the Demons themselves. I did not obtain this information from reading a book. Everything read from books concerning Demons was wrong information. Most of the information about Demons in popular books was taken from the old grimoires written by Jewish rabbis and a few xians. Azazel came to speak to me and he told me the Demons are really upset about the disrespect Father Satan has received, even from his own people. They are not impressed with LaVeyan “Satanists” (most are atheists) and those who attempt to use Father Satan like some sort of servant. Unfortunately, many people come to Satan after experiencing the negative and spiritually destructive influences of other religions. We do not always have to do a full ritual every time we want to contact Father Satan. I pray to him every single day and thank him for all he has done for me. He always hears me and responds to me. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of establishing a very close relationship with Satan, for here is where you will learn and grow. The closer I become to Father Satan, the more I am inspired and in awe 264"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"of him. There is so much spiritual richness and fulfillment when we make Satan the center of our lives. Regular rituals are also very important. For those who are new, it is important to put aside everything of your past and get to know Father Satan without any assumptions. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Demon Friends Due to the false teachings of enemy religions, there are those among us who do not take our religion as serious as they should. The spiritual growth, liberation, and power that are available to us as Satanists are often beyond the awareness of many. There are times we may have trivial issues or instances where we could use some correction, enlightenment and spiritual assistance. When we establish a relationship with a Demon friend, we have someone who will patiently guide us, direct us, and work with us one on one. Many see Demons as magickal assistants who will help in avenging enemies, securing money, love, success, and so forth. The Demons are there to help us out in our external affairs when we are new, but another very important area is also that of spiritual growth. In the area of advancing spiritually, many are unaware of the help a Demon friend can be. The goal of Satanism is self-empowerment and spiritual self-sufficiency. Through my relationship with my Demon, Azazel, I have learned much more about Father Satan and our religion. All of this has been very enlightening and positive for me and I learned many things I never knew before. There are those of us who have issues, questions and blocks that would benefit greatly by working one on one with a Demon. For those of you, who are new to Spiritual Satanism, when you feel ready, perform a ritual where you ask Father Satan to send you a Demon to work with you, personally. This in truth is what the Demons are for; helping us to become as Gods in a literal sense. Write your request on a piece of paper, asking that Father Satan send you a Demon for you and at the height of the ritual, read it aloud and then burn the paper. This is just a suggestion, as many of us have our own way of performing rituals. You will receive signs soon afterwards. Remember to be patient, open and aware. You will recognize your new friend. I cannot begin to tell you the further enlightenment I have received and how I have improved and become much stronger in Satan. Life is an opportunity to improve and advance. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich The Egyptian Pyramids To this day, atheistic scholars and scientists are at a loss to explain the megalithic structures and extremely advanced civilizations that existed in ancient times. These structures still stand today after thousands of years. After the flood, much of the landscape was eroded. A landing base was needed for the Gods and the 265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"twin pyramids at Giza in Egypt were built to replicate the twin peaks of Mount Ararat.¹ Measurements were taken from the skies. The Gods also used the Pyramids to do ritual work, for magickal ceremonies and initiation rites.² There are 365.24 cubits in the pyramid's base. This corresponds exactly to the solar year. The sum of the base diagonals gives an approximation of the number of years in a total precession of the equinoxes. (Just short of 26,000). The pyramid's apex corresponds to the North Pole, the perimeter is equivalent to the equator, and its four plane surfaces accurately represent the four quadrants of the hemisphere. These measurements parallel the ley lines and magnetic fields of the Earth. The exteriors of the great pyramids were originally covered with limestone and they shone in the Sun. The limestone has been picked off over the centuries. The Gods placed crystals inside of the pyramids. The power of the crystals produced a beam that reflected up to the sky. To this day, the electrical current at the apex of the pyramids is so powerful it has knocked men unconscious. The pyramids also reverberated from the inside to serve as a landing guide. The Gods called them the \"lofty houses of eternity.\"³ The pyramids were built in the Age of Leo, according to what was written by the Gods. This is the reason for the Sphinx, which has the body of a lion. The face on the Sphinx was originally that of the Egyptian God Thoth. Due to rivalry between brothers Thoth and Marduk/Amon Ra, the face was eventually changed to that of Amon Ra. 4 Satan/Enki was given the \"Lower World.\" These were the lands beneath the equator. This included all of Egypt, though Egypt is north of the equator. 5 In 1904, Aleister Crowley spent the night in one of the Pyramids. He claimed a purple light lit up the entire area inside of the pyramid. Archeologists and Egyptologists who have explored the Pyramids are at a loss to explain the absence of torch marks at a time when they believed electricity and other means of light were not yet invented. Napoleon, in the year 1798 entered one of the Pyramids. When he came back out, he was pale faced and in awe. He would never reveal what he saw as he claimed no one would ever believe him. Ancient Wisdom The original religions were quite different from the false religions of today. The original religions taught self-reliance and strength of mind and spirit. Thoth wrote, \"A soul's outcome in the afterlife is based upon knowledge.\" \"Knowledge of past lives can be acquired by breathing exercises, which recall the memory of the soul.\" Breathing exercises empower the aura and stimulate the Kundalini. Kundalini knocks down walls in the mind. All of the original religions placed great emphasis on the serpent. The serpent is symbolic of the force known as “kundalini” that lies coiled at the base of the spine. The serpent is also symbolic of healing and of life. Thoth said, in the afterlife, the question that lay ahead was \"How well the deceased person had established truth in his or her lifetime, against the powers of evil.\" We all know how xianity and its cohorts promote lies and strive to keep people ignorant and deprived of true spirituality. Victims of these religions are cut off from the spirit world and any gifts they might have. How many can astral project their soul from their body to actually experience the astral? The astral is a place they will surely go when they die. Many Satanists have this ability and are 266"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"knowledgeable and familiar with the astral. This is a gift from Satan and a definite help when one leaves one's body permanently. Satan is the bringer of knowledge. Truth is looking at life with your own eyes. We learn the truth for ourselves, while outsiders remain ignorant and cut off from any spiritual guidance. Another question of Thoth was, \"Did the deceased embrace life enough to be able to live again in death?\" Life is for living, learning and experiencing to the fullest. Judeo/Xianity and its cohorts, again, work to prevent this. The more you live, learn and experience, the more competent you become; Satan wants us to become self-sufficient. \"Did the deceased develop a strong enough character to continue his or her personality?\" Strength is so important. Our character is tested when we give our souls to Father Satan. Here we take one of the most courageous steps of our lives. Most of us go up against everything we have been indoctrinated with throughout our lives with bold defiance. Here we show our true character, that we are not manipulated by fears, threats, and things we truly do not understand. This is a huge spiritual step in liberation of the self and soul. \"Is the heart of the deceased truly open spiritually?\" Again, as Satanists, all of us have proven we are open spiritually. We have not cut ourselves off as those of other religions have who refuse to question or explore anything outside of what they have been taught. Thoth said, \"Knowledge gives the power to act in truth and causes life, while ignorance blinds the sight and causes death.\" \"Death is the result of ignorance, alone.\" \"A human being needs a map to travel both in this lifetime and beyond.\" \"How can you travel in life, after death without knowing the way?\" \"The wickedness of the soul is ignorance and the virtue of the soul is knowledge.\" \"Live your life and you will never die.\" Father Satan and his Demons share this knowledge. Look back at how you have grown spiritually, since coming to Satan. Mastery of all areas of magick is essential. With black magick, we learn how to defend ourselves and exact justice, psychically. This is the most difficult to master and the most rewarding, as we become liberated and fearless. We become confident in our own abilities, as we can be formidable enemies. We no longer have to take abuse. The Demons are all the Original Gods, most were very friendly with and spent much time with humans. Considerably outnumbered, they were hated, banished, and cursed by the other Gods for sharing knowledge with humans. Many ancient tablets and libraries were burned, destroying all information and in attempt to sever any human contact with the Old Gods who promoted wisdom and learning. Most of the Old Gods were made into monsters, Demons and every nefarious image imaginable in an attempt to destroy any and all relationships with humans. As many of you are finding, your Demon guides are very friendly and open to contact with you. They wish to help you learn and grow spiritually and become strong competent Satanists. Thoth also wrote: \"Human beings must become enlightened in order to find their way in the dark. Becoming enlightened means becoming smart travelers, who acquire knowledge of the way, an understanding of the local language and friendship with other travelers. We are all travelers in eternity.\" 267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Father Satan and his Demons are willing to help us. We should be very thankful. Those Who are Without Last night at work, I got to talking with a man who comes to work out regularly. (I work in an athletic/health club as the overnight attendant). This man, I found is very gifted. Our conversation focused on the occult and mysticism. The strength of this man's aura was incredible. He said he practiced frequent meditation, visualization and other psychic disciplines. He revealed that his life is in the shambles and pretty much out of his control. He has so much potential and with all this potential, he is down, dejected and depressed as his problems have reached the overwhelming stage. Regardless of the raw power an individual may have, when one is on their own, he/she will only go so far and that's it. Talent is useless if one does not know how to apply it, use it, and know how to work to advance it. Satan gives us all of that. He shows us the way to becoming. Each one of us has unique abilities. Father Satan works with us individually to bring these out in us and to show us how to use these abilities to transform our lives for the better. There are many involved in Occult studies and disciplines. Only when one makes a sincere commitment to Satan will knowledge and its applications be given to them. We Satanists are much more evolved than the rest. HAIL SATAN!! - High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Keeping the Faith In the years 2001-2002, I put my efforts into study, as this is what Father Satan wanted me to do. Money was short, but Father Satan took care of all of my essential needs. At the health club I worked at, there was a woman who was a member. She offered to take me to the store and buy me a pair of shoes. The shoes I was wearing were shot to say the least. I had bad feet and the old shoes were comfortable. The problem was, this woman was deep into xianity. She proselytized incessantly. She knew I had no interest in her religion and I told her not to pray for me, ever. I am friendly to people and outgoing and she and I had been friendly towards each other. I got to thinking, this is getting too friendly. She is too xian and she talks to others about going to church and taking part in other xian activities. I remembered what Father Satan stated in the Al Jilwah about his not allowing friendly association with xians and people who are against him. In addition, I have repeatedly seen and read of serious problems whenever one of us associates with xians. I love Father Satan more than anything and in no way will I do anything against his wishes. I said to myself, NO, right there. I don't care if my shoes have holes in them. I don't even care if I am barefoot, I won't go against Satan. 268"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Several hours later that night, I found a brand new shoe box. Inside was the nicest pair of athletic shoes, VERY expensive and exactly my size. I put the shoes on and they fit perfectly. I thanked Father Satan for the shoes. I don't know where the shoes came from, as they weren't there before. I have seen Father Satan's miracles before. HAIL SATAN!! -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Secrets Satanism is the path of knowledge. The closer we become to Satan, the more he reveals to us and the more we learn. With knowledge comes understanding. We build on the knowledge we have. In the Al Jilwah, Father Satan tells us to keep his secrets; he reveals knowledge to us when we are ready. Father Satan has given me tests; tests of my faith. I didn't know it at the time, but I passed these tests and my faith is stronger than ever before. For me, these tests involved playing upon fears. At the time, I was afraid, but I continued on, regardless. I chose to have faith in Satan, no matter what. This was some time ago. Satan also states, \"When temptation comes, I give my covenant to those who trust in me.\" Trust is important as is keeping the faith and staying strong in the face of adversity. The rewards are great and priceless. We all have a free will. When we show Father Satan our dedication to him, he rewards us greatly. It's like passing on to another level where the weak are left behind and the strong remain to continue on. Here is where we learn directly from Satan and his Demons. The answers to some of those tests are now given. When we reach this level, we can only continue. With the knowledge and enlightenment we have, we will never regress, but continue to grow. Knowledge makes regression impossible. This is where everything ties in and begins to make sense and form a picture. Each level of Satanism is another revelation in truth and a test where the strong and fearless survive the weak. With knowledge, when we walk through a door, it is permanently slammed shut behind us and the only direction to go is to continue forward. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Sermon on Halloween Halloween *is* the Devil's Holiday. People are dressing up in costumes, going to parties, indulging in treats and candy, watching scary movies and having an over-all great time, in contrast to Xmas, where the numbers of suicides top those of the rest of the year. Xmas would be completely miserable if it were not for Santa Claus, Yule trees, gift giving and New Year's partying. The damper on Xmas is the Nazarene. How many of those Xians would rather stay home than go to their churches like the slaves that they are? In truth, everything connected with the Nazarene is very negative and draining. Halloween is fun because it has no place for the Nazarene. Everything connected with Father Satan is FUN!! 269"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"HAIL SATAN!! “Witchcraft” Satanism is a religion of the mind. Nearly 100% of all Satanists, past and present have practiced and taken a serious interest in witchcraft, magick, and the occult. Witchcraft has always been synonymous with Satanism. \"Witch\" means \"wise one.\" Because of persecution, most sorcerers and practitioners of the magickal arts/powers of the mind, years ago worked in secrecy. The Gods are all extra-terrestrials. In nearly every authentic account of direct human interaction with aliens, the aliens displayed advanced powers of the mind. Telepathic communication took place, even with humans who had no previous experiences with this. Levitation, telekinesis, healing, performing a mind wipe (Where one forgets everything that occurred), and other powers of the mind, deemed extraordinary by humans are commonplace for the majority of these beings. Witchcraft is nothing more than attempts by human beings at attaining powers of the mind that are our birthright. For centuries, the Christian Churches, and their cohorts have done everything in their power to frighten people away from attempting to use the power of which other beings in the universe have full access. The sole purpose and objective of Christianity has always been to remove all spiritual knowledge and prevent people from accessing the powers of their minds and souls, so this power can be kept in the hands of a \"chosen\" few world domination. Humanity has been held dangerously and purposely back by Christianity. This not only places us as a whole in a seriously vulnerable and defenseless position, but also damns the soul that is at the complete mercy of other beings with power. The enemy extraterrestrials, which outnumber the friendly ones, look upon humanity as beasts to be exploited. Their goal is to use the energy of our souls after we die, for their own purposes. The only way they can succeed is through humanity’s spiritual ignorance and lack of spiritual power. This is one reason I strongly encourage people to perform the dedication ritual to Satan. When we make a commitment to Satan, he protects us as we advance spiritually. Many, who go it alone with sorcery and advancing their souls, meet with disaster. This does not come from Satan, but is from the enemy who uses fear and negative experiences to frighten and discourage people from attaining any real power. Those who reach a certain level, stand out on the astral. There are numerous Yahoo groups on the internet, those who are without, who discuss kundalini and other psychic empowerment phenomena and the negative experiences these people have are rampant. I subscribed to several of these groups some time ago and read many messages concerning negative experiences with astral entities and anxiety attacks and other intrusions where these people suffered attacks they had no explanation for. One woman permanently lost all of her hair after performing a spell. As the illustration in the text used in the movie \"The Nine Gates\" warned, \"Venture too far and danger can descend on you from up above\" this is true to reality. Many so-called \"spooks\" are in reality extraterrestrials, including the cyclops, fairies, elves, gnomes, and others. Fairies, gnomes, and related are elemental beings that only have one or two elements to their souls, where human beings have four: fire, earth, air, and water. These beings are also adept at astral projection and other feats, which explain much of the \"hallucinations\" experienced by those who open their minds up enough to \"see\" them. Non-conformity is a major part of Satanism. Those who conform are sheep and will never have the strength to think for themselves enough to see the truth and evolve to a higher level. One cannot 270"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"conform if one wishes to empower one’s self. One must completely know one’s self in order to evolve and effectively practice magick and not follow the herd. Every problem can be solved with the right kind of knowledge. Knowledge also eliminates fear and is the key to power. Earth Day When I was new to Satanism, I had many blatant spiritual experiences. One night, I was walking into the parking lot where I live, and I had just finished a cola and as usual, I threw the bottle. This was a habit. As most of you know, I was an atheist before Satan came into my life and I didn't care about a thing. I felt something tap me in the back of the head and a voice came into my head and warned me to \"pick that up!\" I immediately got the picture. Later on I was reading where the Yezidi Devil worshippers of Iraq would not even so much as spit on the ground, because the Earth belongs to Satan. From these experiences, it is obvious that Father Satan is concerned about the Earth. At work, I had access to recycling. It was my job to clean overnight. When doing the garbage rounds, I took the plastic out (most of the stuff was clean and I had gloves) and put it into the recycle bins. I did the same with aluminum cans. This pleases Father Satan. Many may ask, what difference does it make? A LOT. EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS!! Don't worry about others, just take care of you and yours. Littering and desecrating the Earth is showing disrespect to Satan. We don't have to go out of our way, just take care of our own messes. Satanism is a life loving religion. We are alive on this Earth; this is Father Satan's place for us. By each of us doing our part, we can help make this a better place and set an example for others. Finding Things for Yourself In the Black Book, Satan instructed his followers to memorize the teachings he dictated, because so much is \"altered.\" There is hardly any truth remaining anymore. I have found as many of us have in my relationship with Father Satan, he is totally unlike any of the widespread teachings would try to have us believe. The Demons are not evil. Many specialize in the teaching of \"ethics.\" Ethical beings are not evil. There are many Demons. The Demons are the Original Gods, of whom Satan is the most powerful and important, as he is our Creator God. Satan and the Original Gods were cursed and condemned for giving humanity knowledge. The aliens who pose as the judeo/xian “God” seized power and incited their chosen ones to mass murder and destroy anyone who worshipped the Original Gods. Entire cities and peoples were wiped out and temples and shrines were destroyed, along with any written records. As a result, we know very little, if any truth concerning the Original Gods. Nearly everything written about them is from the enemy. Here is where humanity lost all connection to spirituality. The spiritual emptiness of mainstream religions followed and ruled through terror. When the control of organized religion weakened, many 271"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"turned to atheism out of futility with what they mistakenly believed to be spirituality- emptiness and nothingness. This is why it is important to find things for ourselves, and if possible to share with others. This way we can learn from each other. There is so much more to Satanism that has remained unexplored. Many times when non-Satanists attempt to find things pertaining to our religion, they are misled by lies. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Spiritual Satanism Last night, I was working on some Demonic sigils, making larger copies by hand for a project. After a while of working on these (it wasn't easy) I began to notice much positive energy and that the sigils gave me an elated feeling. It was 2 am and I was tired, this surprised me. I got to thinking of all of the lies that have been pushed upon people and how Satanism has been so suppressed. There is so much spiritual beauty and bliss in Satanism. The closer we become to Father Satan, we find how positive and wonderful he is. Many times, he has filled me with extreme joy. There is nothing wrong with making Father Satan the center of our lives, if we choose to do so. Becoming close to him, for me, has been an experience beyond words. Each and every day he fills my spirit with strength and joy. I am proud to be a Satanist. Within the \"religiousness\" of Satanism, is where we find inner freedom and liberation. The closer we become to Satan, we find we fear nothing. People fear because of a lack of knowledge. Satan gives us knowledge. I have an altar where I pray to Father Satan every day and do regular rituals. Through this interaction, he has given me much enlightenment and spiritual understanding. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Excuses Christianity becomes more and more sickening every day. One of the main reasons this virus has thrived as long as it has is the rationalizing and making of excuses by most of its followers. The latest I heard is \"you can't blame the Christian \"God\" for what his followers do.\" THIS IS A TOTAL LIE! This is the excuse of the uneducated cop out. Each time a priest says mass, he invokes the Nazarene. The \"body and blood\" of the Nazarene are also symbolized in the communion host and the wine. The congregation also invokes the Nazarene, but on a much lesser level. Look at what they do. There are many well-meaning individuals who come of age and enroll in the Christian seminary to enter the clergy. Through ignorance and deception, they believe they are doing the right thing. We can all see what becomes of them. There is a big difference between who they were when they went in and what they become. The effects of years of invoking the Nazarene are apparent: child molesting, preaching lies, confusion, and exploiting their congregations; the inquisitors who mass murdered millions of their fellow human beings through torture; endless extortion and other criminal means of obtaining money. The elderly have been bilked out of their life savings and the lives of billions have been ruined. Many fools attempt to twist the Christian bible and its teachings to suit their own purposes. They are too weak to stand against it and see it for what it is for. They are afraid of going against the herd. They 272"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"can't look at it for what it really says. Then all these fools never agree with each other and wars begin over this garbage. Because the Christian Bible is a compilation of stolen legends, characters and twisted and altered writings, there are enough contradictions to where one can have it fit anything. Every single person I have ever known or heard of that has evoked angelic beings has met with misfortune to say the least. These angelic beings, like their “God,” have an insatiable and relentless hatred of humanity. They are always bringers of bad news/omens and destructive prophesy. They prey on and bring death to little children. They also refuse to relate any real knowledge to humans, unlike Demons who are friendly and open with enlightening humans. True spirituality is always here for us Satanists and we don't have to go to any elaborate practices to tap into the spirit world. The spirits come to us freely. When someone has to go to the lengths to contact the spirits, there is a real problem. The Creation of Humanity When we look to the Black Book of Satan; The Al-Jilwah, we find in Chapter IV, Father Satan says: \"I have allowed the creation of four substances, four times and four corners; because they are necessary things for creatures.\" This is a description of the DNA molecule! Anyone who is familar with the composition and structure of DNA knows the molecule is spiral shaped, and coiled like a SERPENT. The DNA also has rungs like a ladder. The rungs of the ladder are made up of FOUR compounds, called bases. The bases are adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. (Abbreviated A, C, T and G). These FOUR nucleotides can combine in pairs, in sequences of limitless variety and are bound into place. DNA IS THE BASIS OF LIFE! Without DNA, life would not exist. The Serpent is the symbol of healing for both the body and the soul. The Serpent is also the symbol of medicine. The medical caduceus has two serpents entwined around a staff. This can be seen in nearly every doctor's office and symbolizes the kundalini, which is of Satan. The Serpent is also a symbol of wisdom and knowledge. THE SERPENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SYMBOL OF SATAN AND REPRESENTS WISDOM, KNOWLEDGE, HEALING, AND LIFE. Father Satan also states in the Black Book: \"None shall live in this world longer than the time set by me.\" Satan created us and determined our life span, as humans. When he attempted to make us as the Gods and give us immortality, the other Gods stopped him. The teachings of the false alien \"god\" warp, pervert and malign everything that is good for us. The xians have attempted to turn the Serpent into a symbol of horror. If it wasn't for xianity, medical science would already have cures for just about every disease or medical condition there is, including aging. Fun with Demons Once we establish a close relationship with our Guardian Demon, he/she can help us to astral project and accompany us when we visit places on the astral. We can have beautiful experiences, learn, and have fun. After knowing your Demon friend for a while, find out more about him or her. What he/she likes/dislikes. They are all individuals as we are. 273"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"There are many beautiful and interesting places in Hell. Be patient. Sometime, if you are open, your Demon may take you there. There are many fun and pleasant experiences on the astral. The more we astral project, the easier it becomes. Our Demons take us when we are ready. Backwards The reason for the inverted crucifixes, pentagrams, and reversed symbols in Satanism is to convey a very important message: THINGS ARE BACKWARDS! The Judeo/Christian religion and its cohorts are all false religions. They are the true evil, though they masquerade as benevolent. Their real purpose is to stop humanity from advancing spiritually and to keep spiritual knowledge and power in the hands of a few who have abused it for centuries. Humanity has suffered greatly as a result. The Christian \"God\" had nothing to do with our creation, this entity and ilk hate humans and only wish to torture and enslave us. Satan is our True Father and Creator; THE TRUE GOD IS THE LIBERATOR OF HUMANITY, THE ONE WHO FREES US. The \"God\" that the Christians, Jews and Muslims worship is the enslaver; the Prince of Lies. In truth, God and the Devil are backwards. SATAN is the TRUE Father and Creator of humanity. Christian Greed Money is the only thing keeping the insanity and that evil institution going. Do you realize just where we Satanists would be if we owned radio stations, prime time TV slots, buildings taking up entire city blocks, book stores, printing presses, publishers, and the list goes on and on. We'd have the world in 6 months or less. The typical xian preacher has diamonds dripping off the fingers, snake skin belt, lizard skin shoes, $3,000.00 silk suit, tennis courts, Olympic size swimming pool in the back \"yard,\" private chauffeur, limo, $1,000,000.00+ mansion. It's about time these corrupted individuals pay! Xianity is pushed relentlessly. There are very few, if any alternatives. Any other viable alternatives that are a threat to the xian religion, which is really a program, are maligned, vehemently discouraged and kept in the dark. Money has power. The xian churches are worth trillions and trillions of dollars. Centuries of tithing, extortion, looting, frightening people into donating their life savings, and so forth are the foundations of xianity. What is done with all this money? It is used for CONTROL. Christianity, Judaism and Islam are the three major religions that run the world. The Christian and Muslim religions are especially threatening, because their doctrines espouse violent annihilation of all opposition. Xian bibles, books, literature are printed out copiously. Xian bookstores are plentiful. Money is never at a shortage for building their places of worship, funding their ministries, televising their evangelists en masse, buying radio stations in order to broadcast their plethora of lies and keeping the human populace from true spirituality. The Vatican operates an assassination and hit squad controlled by the Jesuits. The Vatican also has one of the largest libraries in the world. Over hundreds of years, this institution worked vigorously to confiscate all spiritual texts and knowledge of which it has either kept from public circulation or systematically destroyed. Centuries of spiritual writings are kept under the most strict secrecy and vault like security, and are only open to a few \"trusted\" clergy in high positions. It is obvious they have plenty to hide. Did you know that some of these top cardinals and clergy have turned to Lucifer? They 274"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"know the truth concerning \"YHVH\" being a fictitious \"God.\" In their studies, they are finding that Lucifer is the True Father and Creator of mankind. Christians have a history of burning libraries and any knowledge they can get their hands on. These libraries contained knowledge of the truth. The truth of where we really came from. The truth about the \"Gods,\" and their relationship to humanity. The level of corruption and lies is staggering within the Christian Church. Many people are lost and as a result are open to the enemy. No matter what we are involved in, it always helps to have guidance and knowledge. Guidance and knowledge have been withheld from many of our people for far too long. Many find themselves totally alone, with the enemy religions forever being forced upon them. They have no support from friends or family, no place of Satanic worship to go to and find themselves all alone. They are labeled as being \"evil,\" told they will \"burn and burn\" in Hell, told they are \"wrong,\" \"lost,\" and continually face extreme and fierce opposition. They are told Satan is \"evil,\" and that he \"hates humanity,\" \"causes human suffering\" and all other kinds of lies, when in truth it is the xian churches and their false \"God\" who are to blame. They just can't leave us alone can they? With literally trillions of dollars and power and they still have to keep pushing it. You know, somehow, it's hard to believe we are all so unaware of xianity. So unaware, that they have to compulsively and continuously attempt to jam it down our throats. In the end, it has been written, the truth will come out. Father Satan is the true God and Father of humanity. The REAL prince of lies is not going to go for the small stakes, the Christians, Muslims and Jews all worship him and sing him praises. Yes, they are sheep. They have been fooled. We all know what happens to sheep. This is the ultimate hoax. These people know nothing of true spirituality, how to advance, defend or save their own souls. They will be helpless victims in the face of real spiritual alien opposition. Their numerous and shameful scandals speak for themselves. Each time an xian priest or minister says a mass or service, he invokes the nazarene. The spirit of the nazarene influences his behavior. (Pedophilia). \"YE SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR WORKS\" The TRUE God is the LIBERATOR of humanity, the bringer of TRUTH and light. \"THERE IS NO GOD BUT MYSELF\" \"KNOWING THIS, WHO DARES WORSHIP THE FALSE GODS OF THE KORAN AND BIBLE?\" -SATAN FROM THE QU'RET AL-YEZID Old Age Life can get very lonely for the elderly, those who are serving prison sentences, and others who are isolated in some way. One only needs to look at a nursing home to see how the enemy alien god has abandoned his people. When we are with Father Satan, he sends us Demon friends who will befriend us and look out for us. Relationships can be spiritual, physical or for friendship, or whatever one needs. My mother, who is very old, has a Demon friend who gives her important advice, acts as a close friend, 275"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"and is very caring. Her Demon fills her with happiness.

Having Father Satan and a Demon friend to talk with is a great help to many. Unlike the enemy spirits, our Demon friends answer back, talk to us, and let us know we are important and that they are there for us. Fighting Religious Discrimination Last night, my family and I went to the local Wal-Mart to get groceries. I openly wear my Baphomet at all times. When we got to the checkout, the woman behind the register said \"Jesus.\" I don't know why, probably a Demon in me, I automatically said \"Satan.\" Then she said \"Jesus\" again. This went on back and forth about four times. The woman was also rude. My husband left after we had our groceries rung up to look for the kids. I had to go to work and I was debating what I should do. I stood there waiting and sure enough, I turned around and this guy who works for the store was practically in my face. I asked him for the manager and he said he was the manager. I complained about the woman and how she treated me because of my religious symbol. I politely explained that \"This is America.\" I also politely added that I could call the A.C.L.U. and file a law suit. I said I had to go to work and the woman \"upset my entire night\" (this is grounds for legal action). I also explained that the woman is \"clocked in on the job.\" The manager apologized and said he would take action. Father Satan was telling me something here. The coincidence that my husband left to look for the kids (I had to wait), and the manager just happened to be right behind me in a huge store. Tolerating insults and discrimination against Satan, as an adult in a situation that is not life threatening is turning the other cheek and is an insult to Satan. If I hadn't said anything, I would have been stewing all night at work and even the next day. Complaints should be handled politely and in a professional manner, but should never be avoided. This discrimination has to stop. Only through us can this stop and Satanism can be open and free. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Satanic Love With all the New Age hype, there is this emphasis on love, love, love. Love is an emotion. Yes, it is essential to human happiness and one's well-being, but all of this emphasis on \"love\" has cheapened it and made it to be something it is not. ALL emotions are equally valid and essential. The truth is- love is something everyone must earn. Of course, there is misplaced love, as in situations where one becomes infatuated or even obsessed with another person and the love is not returned. These are emotions out of control and can be something very ugly and painful. Satanism is about being free and living with nature. Love for love's sake, or love that is wasted on 276"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"ingrates is abuse of this emotion. Foolish xians are taught to love their enemies. This teaching is suicidal. How long would our bodies last if our immune systems turned the other cheek so to speak and loved invaded viruses? These sick twisted teachings regarding love can land one in the psychiatrist's office. This is where so many of these people end up going at certain points in their lives. Abuse of love, like the other teachings of the nazarene, leads to confusion and chaos. True love is something that is earned upon a foundation of mutual empathy, kindness, trust, and goodwill between two people. Love is a two-way street. Loving enemies, illnesses and anything and anyone just for the sake of love is unnatural and very unhealthy. Father Satan loves those of us who come to him with an open heart. He does not waste his love on xians or other deluded fools who reject him. Satan takes care of his own. This is the true meaning of love. Love is a two-way street. As for self-love, this is definitely something like self-esteem, which one earns. When you excel or exceed and you know you are the best you can be, you will be proud of yourself. True pride and self- love go hand in hand. I am not talking about mindless arrogance, just recognition of one's self and one's efforts for a job well done, and a sense of accomplishment. People who work to better themselves in one way or another will reap rewards. The rewards are personal pride and self-love. Those who do not bother with themselves have nothing to be proud of and more often than not, these people have low self-esteem. All of these false New Age teachings with their focus on love are detrimental to one's mental health, emotional health, and worse. One should focus on reality. \"Loving\" everything and everyone only sets one up to be a victim, to have low self-esteem and places one upon the path of delusion. These people only go so far as ALL true \"occult\" is of the Devil and one must give the Devil his due to advance. Others are merely trespassing. Satan does not look out for them or love them. Why should he? True love is a two-way Street. Dabbling My purpose for writing this sermon is because I feel this issue is something important for people to be aware of. I do not believe in telling others how to think or what they should or how they should believe, this is up to the individual, but one important thing everyone should be aware of is- Satanism is very different from other religions. Satanism is different in that it does not mix. Mixing Satanism and Christianity for example is like mixing water with electricity. I have seen and read accounts where certain people who had an interest in Satanism, still had sympathies with Christianity. There were still strong unconscious ties to the Christian religion, most resulting from intense indoctrination. Most of us come from Christian backgrounds and for many there are lingering issues and hang-ups. Christian programming is very intense and given the extremely large amounts of psychic energy that have gone into it through centuries of Christian prayers and belief, there is a lot of power one must overcome to be totally free. People who are uncertain of their beliefs and who still have strong ties to Christianity or other related religions, either consciously, or in many cases subconsciously, are setting themselves up for some very frightening and negative psychic experiences. Calling upon Demons and going deep into the occult can bring up some very unexpected negative 277"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"encounters for dabblers. This is the work of enemy alien entities that use fear to keep humans away Satan. In most cases this works, as it instills terror in the dabbler and he/she usually goes running back to the nazarene and blames Satan. I strongly suggest those who wish to go this far, first become strong in Satan. Very, very few, if any, progress in power unless they have a powerful protector. When one who is serious in developing the powers of the mind advances to any formidable level, or has any serious ability, he/she will be approached by powerful entities asking him/her to take sides in the spiritual war. The truly gifted who walk alone usually don’t live very long on this earth without the protection of a higher power. I feel it is important to warn those who are undecided or lukewarm to stay away from calling up Demons or trying to contact spirit entities until they are spiritually ready. Everyone is welcome here, from the dedicated to the curious. Knowledge should be open and available for everyone. There are some things, though that are advanced and one should wait before getting involved in these practices. At some point, it is a very important step in Satanism to cut all ties with any and all other religions. To avoid doing this is inviting disaster. This must be done from the soul in that there should be no indecision or mixed feelings. If there are mixed feelings, then one should wait, as this is a permanent step. For those of you who have already performed dedication rituals, you are fine. You can get into the advanced practices, but it is still important to deprogram yourself from any Christian teachings. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Learning The occult sections in most bookstores are full of misinformation and lies. If we are open enough, Satan and the Demons will teach us. The key is to have an open mind, and aside all past programming. Prayer is when we communicate, silence is when we listen. I pray every day. After I pray, I remain quiet and open. Answers come in the form of guidance or revelations. If your third eye is fully open, you will be able to see the Demons as they speak. There is no need to go through the procedures of summoning. The closer you get to Satan; Demons will come to you on their own. This is beautiful, as they are our teachers and our friends. What has been written in the grimoires sickens me. Like everything else the enemy has been into, these writings show one how to destroy true spirituality. You don't ever disrespect or show arrogance to your teachers. This is one of the greatest opportunities to learn, that is offered to us, and is sacred. If you ever summon a Demon, there is no need for a \"license to depart.\" Let them come to you, teach you, and guide you. Don't waste their time. Put the learning into action to better yourself. We can do our Demons friends a favor, by fighting against spiritual ignorance and stupidity. Let others who are misguided by popular occult book garbage know how wrong this is if you ever run across them or see posts on the internet. I always speak up. Much of what I have learned has been through experience. There is nothing like experience. Books that are properly written can only be a guide. The biggest obstacle in learning is what you already assume or have been taught to assume. Look at things the way they are, much knowledge is in front of our faces, we just don't see it, because we've been taught not to. 278"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"When we make friends with the Demons, many things in our lives are taken care of, without the asking like justice for instance. For centuries, humanity has been closed off from spiritual help because of the enemy religions. We have remained spiritually ignorant and in the dark. The Demons have waited in silence. The time has come to aggressively dispel all of the ignorance and helplessness that have enslaved us for so long. When humanity bridges the gap with ancient spiritual knowledge, the human race will progress as a whole. The Catholic Pope The Catholoc Pope is the epitome of the xian religion. What does he do? He sits, and sits. Like an empty shell. He has no personality. He is just a waste of a human being who just sits and sits. This is the epitome of an xian “saint.” People really don't need to go to the bother of carting these deadbeats around. One just needs to bring their picture and prop it up where it can be seen. This saves a lot of time, trouble, energy, and it serves the same purpose. The same goes for these so-called \"saints.\" They say nothing. A perfect slave has no personality, whatsoever! This is the complete opposite of spirituality. Spirit means life, feeling, motivation, essence, and purpose. True spirituality is not characteristic of one who moves about as if they have a motion sensitive bomb strapped to them, or one who stares into space like a catatonic. One with spirit lives their life to the fullest. The xian pope and company are prime examples of the anti-life and anti-spirituality of their death promoting religion. The appearance of the Catholic Pope is much like that of dragging around a rotted corpse. There are reports that the top clergy in the Vatican at one time made a pact with the alien greys- souls in exchange for wealth. The greys harvest human souls in a mass of energy they call “The One.” The xian religion has no spirituality. It is all material and dead. Last year, when the pedophilia scandals were finally out of the Vatican’s control, the Catholic Pope addressed Satan as \"His Infernal Majesty.\" It can be seen in front of the world that this Pope of theirs has really gotten a spiritual beat down. Helloween There have been reports of hysterical mothers ranting how a teenager of theirs, got involved in \"role playing games\" which led to \"occult activities\" which further led them to \"Satanism,\" and they ended up committing suicide. As for those role-playing books, the contents in some are sick beyond belief and have NO relation to Satanism whatsoever, other than from a warped, twisted and sick xian point of view. These troubled kids, who are too young to think critically, who have been brainwashed with xian sickness in seriously dysfunctional homes, who have no positive alternative outlet and believe these lies, take this stuff literally. \"Infernalism: The Left Hand Path of Screams,\" by White Wolf was one of the worst fabricated diatribes on Satanism I have ever seen. This is one of the many direct, slanderous, and negligent attacks on our religion where the author(s), should be held accountable in a court of law for writing this crap. Unfortunately, Satan is the one who always gets the blame. These maggots who make money off of these slanderous lies, should be held accountable for their actions. Hopefully, some day, they will. This also brings to mind another matter. Halloween is a fun time where kids and adults alike, party, dress up in costumes and have lots of fun. This is a good thing and should always take place every year, 279"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"as it is a positive thing. What is NOT positive is how people don hideously ugly masks with horns, etc., making a mockery of Father Satan. There is an infinite variety of characters one has to choose from without having to resort to making a mockery of the God we worship, revere, and hold sacred. Let's turn the tables here. You know if the nazarene wasn't such a sorry joke, with all the blood and gore, he is actually scary. For starters, a lightweight wooden cross, hollowed out on the inside can be equipped with a small sliding door where candy and other treats can be inserted. In addition to acting as a candy receptacle, the cross can be used to defend against thugs who, through laziness would rather rob legitimate trick- or-treaters of their hard earned candy than go door to door like the rest. A neon crown of thorns can be wired to a nine volt battery, blinking on and off, followed by lights circling around the head in different colors. Another battery can supply a small, though loud, speaker booming out church organ music, every so often intercepted by- \"have you heard the good news?\" \"His pain, your gain\" \"have you been saved?\" \"Jesus loves you\" \"this is my son in whom I am well pleased.\" This way, one can hear the nazarene coming for blocks and get the basket of candy ready at the door. A placard can be attached to the back of the trick-or-treater, advertising: \"CALVARY OR BUST!\" Fake blood tubes can be hooked up to the palms where they can squirt stingy people who refuse to insert treats into the door on the cross. Fake blood must also be applied to resemble the stigmata and other gore. If one really wants to get elaborate, a whip can be included. As for year round, the kiddies shouldn't be left out on the fun. Here's where a Jesus action figure would come in handy, coming with his own toy cross, hammer and nails, holes in the hands and feet where the toy nails can be inserted, providing a good vehicle for developing hand/eye coordination, release of frustration after being told \"no\" or disciplined. The action figure should be flexible enough to go from the cross to the \"pillar\" where a toy whip can \"scourge\" the nazarene for his sins against humanity. (Pillar and whip come with nazarene). The INRI\" at the top of the cross can snap on and off, providing a variety- \"his pain your gain,\" \"Pepsi-Cola,\" \"pedophile on a stick.\" A variety of funny faces/accessories is also included. Various heads can be snapped on and off. Some of you who are old enough might remember \"Kool-Aid’s\" rival who had packets of funny faces- \"Goofy-Grape\" \"Berry- Berry.\" These characters would quite fitting. Enough said? In closing, most role-playing books are based upon the occult and the powers of the mind. Angels work to keep humanity from accessing or knowing of the powers of the mind, usually through ugly experiences that create fear or worse. Angels incite suicide in those who are susceptible, NOT Satan or his Demons. Those of us who have made a commitment to Satan are under his protection. Those who are without are on their own. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Christian Psychic Attack When xians pray either alone (those with a strong mind) or in groups, they can cause those they are trying to coerce into xianity to have nightmares or feel confused. This is nothing more than plain psychic attack and it will eventually go away. Those of us who are strong in Satan are immune to it, although we can still pick it up, as most of us are psychic. Remember, xians always use fear tactics in some way. Their negativity shows. They have thought energy like everyone else. Some of those fools will single a non-xian out and hit him/her hard by 280"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"having an entire congregation pray for him/her for a whole month- so much for their lies and hypocrisy concerning free will. I received a personal e-mail from someone who wrote that they were troubled by bad dreams and xian thoughts. I picked up on this also, this is why I am writing. Azazel told me an xian mass was said against this e-group.* Obviously we are really a threat. This always gives me more motivation. Remember, many of us become victims of xian prayer. If you are ever feeling confused or distraught, just pray to Father Satan. Xians know they cannot post to the e-groups, but like they do with many other Satanic e-groups, they spy on us. Fuck them! We will win in the end. Father Satan will punish them. I am psychic and can always sense xians. In time, when one becomes really strong in Satan and knowledgeable, the attacks will no longer have any effect. Knowledge defeats xian lies. Knowledge is what you see for yourself every day- it requires no explanation or interpretation, it stands alone. The same thing with the planets revolving around the Sun; the earth is round- once you know this, no amount of lies or psychic attack will convince you the universe revolves around a flat earth. You know the truth. Also, you can ask your Demon for help to punish those deluded idiots. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Letting Go I have found in my relationship with Father Satan, it is important to just let go. Satan says in the Black Book, \"I exercise dominion over all creatures and over the affairs of all who are under the protection of my image.\" Having faith can be very trying for many of us. There are those of us who have been abandoned and abused spiritually by the teachings of the enemy, those of us who have been repeatedly screwed over by other human beings, those of us who have witnessed both in seeing it done to others and loved ones, the sorry list goes on and on. It's called reality. Someone was upset with me a while ago and said \"You don't trust anyone\" I said back \"that's why I am still alive.\" In this world, we can't fully trust others, unfortunately. Father Satan is different; he works with us to heal our psychological wounds and to establish trust. I have learned not to worry; just to let go and let Father Satan handle my affairs. He does every time and everything works out for me in a positive way. He has never let me down and has ALWAYS been there for me in my time of need. * The same goes for working magick, using our minds and influencing people. When we completely let go and just focus, this is when our workings are most effective and powerful. When we worry, are distracted, or are overly concerned with what we are doing, we defeat ourselves. In life, we find we cannot trust in this world, but things are different with Father Satan and he proves this to us, all we need is time. Faith in Father Satan is very important. He is the only one I completely trust, along with my Demon, Azazel. HAIL SATAN!! -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich *I wrote this sermon several years ago. Since then I can only say the same. Father Satan has always been there for me, and he is true to his word. He has never let me down. I have never known a more wonderful being.

Yule Season The Yule season is a season of enjoyment and indulgence. • Cooking • Baking • Gift giving • Decorating • Building snowmen and winter sports in places where there is snow • Tree decorating • Blue lights in honor of Lucifer • Partying • Santa Clause for the kids • Shopping and more. The Nazarene as you can see has no place in the Yule season. December 25th is actually the Persian diety Mithra's birthday. The Yule was stolen from the Pagans and incorporated into the Xian religion as Xmas. We need to take back our holiday!! Celebrate and Indulge!! HAIL SATAN!! Baal-Berith, Father of the Yule Thinking for Yourself Here is an excerpt from the book \"Hoaxes\" 1940: \"A coin about the size of a fifty cent piece was passed around a class of 48 boys from 14-17 years of age with instructions to examine it carefully. At the end of the class period, the instructor asked each boy to draw a picture of the coin, indicating the position of the hole in it. Although there was no hole, all but four of the forty-eight indicated one, some even drawing two holes. Of the four, only one, the bad boy of the class unaccustomed to obeying orders, was positive that there was no hole.\" Those who are disobedient and do not conform are always labeled as \"bad\" \"a problem\" \"evil\" and so forth. People are indoctrinated not to think for themselves. People who cannot think for themselves are often sent to their deaths or worse in obedience. Satan and his Demons have been trying to get through to humanity for centuries. Widdershins, inverted crucifixes, everything is backwards. We save our own souls by thinking for ourselves. Everything *is* backwards spiritually. 282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The enemy teaches nothing but lies. In order to be scammed, one is discouraged from questioning or thinking for one's self. Conformity is of strict importance in enslaving and damning the herd. These people are fools. They are so blinded to the lies of their own \"god.\" They have a wall up. Some people wake up through personal tragedy and many turn to atheism. The xians rant and rave “slavery”, “low self-esteem”, “death”, “suicide”, “confusion”, the “Prince of deception and lies\"... What they cannot see is that is their own \"god.\" Their own god is the master deceiver. Everything is backwards. The Satanic symbols are more than just representing the elements, their message is very important for the few who will listen. Always think for yourself. Feeling Confused? Occasionally, many of us feel a little psychically thrown off balance or experience some confusion. My own personal experience in having this problem usually comes down to one source, some stupid xian(s) is praying for me. I remember one time when I was experiencing thoughts of the enemy invading my head, which I promptly cursed; this xian woman was bold enough to admit to me that she was praying for me. When I explained that I had signed my soul over in blood to Lucifer and that I was happy, the mild psychic upsets stopped. Usually, if one tunes into this and knows what it is, the offending xian will be exposed. Everyone has thought energy, even xians. I usually experience their prayers as a psychic nuisance or annoyance, an unwelcome invasion. As for the act of the xian attempting through \"prayer,\" to coerce their offensive and odious beliefs on someone who rejects them, I find this insultingly rude and disrespectful. At any rate, knowing what it is and where it is coming from usually solves the problem. Thoughts have energy, regardless of where they are coming from. This can vary from person to person, depending on one's intensity and the strength of one's aura. Some people are born with a stronger energy field, regardless of religion. This is one of the reasons the xian bible tells followers to \"have faith.\" Many times, through prayer groups or extreme concentration, they can make things happen, and then they believe it was the nazarene. Satan doesn't need a prayer group. He hears and answers us one on one. So much for the hypocritical xian teachings of \"free will.\" -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Blame Shifting By now, everyone is aware of Andrea Yates and how she murdered her five children. The news stories are full of reports that this woman claimed she was \"possessed by the Devil.\" She even went as far as to state she had 666 on her scalp (obviously from watching one or more of \"The Omen\" movie series). There are also numerous news reports that the family was heavily involved with fundamentalist Christians. What most people fail to realize is, looking deeper into this insanity, at the root, AGAIN, we find 283"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Christianity. Christian teachings are chock full of this kind of ludicrous garbage, \"Demonic possession\" and all the rest of that insanity! All this is again is LIES. LIES to keep people away from and terrified of Satan and his Demons; the only ones who are willing to help humanity. The real reason these people get so hysterical is because of a lack of power and knowledge. Christianity has stripped humanity of psychic understanding and power. It is and always has been nothing more than a tool to remove knowledge. Mental institutions are full of Christians, many of whom believe they are possessed by Demons. Mental illness is rampant within the Fundamentalist Christian population. Children raised in Christian homes are often indoctrinated with fear. Doctrines of eternal damnation, evil, torture, self- blame and self-deprecation, spooks, and the like are drummed into these children at an early age, creating life-long hang-ups and this often leads to insanity. Christianity is to blame for the crimes committed from these sick teachings. Christianity sets people up mentally, physically, psychologically, and spiritually for this insanity. Education and this foul religion do not go together because Christianity’s entire foundation is based upon lies. The Christian is warned never to ask any questions, as this represents “a lack of faith” and is a “sin.” Christians are taught not to think, only to “have faith.” Fundamentalist Christians are indoctrinated against having any physical pleasure. They are taught to condemn themselves for any physical expression, to repress their sexuality, and to suffer for \"their sins.\" Psychologically, fear is an ever present factor. Low self-esteem, a lack of self-confidence and every other ugly thing goes along with these suicidal teachings sets one up for insanity. Spiritually, Christians are weak. Most have never experienced or will ever understand true spirituality. With all of the above, we have a walking time bomb. Tell a male dog not to raise its leg when it takes a piss or like Christians would do, punish it; tell a tiger not to eat meat, a duck not to paddle in the water, a boa constrictor not to squeeze and this sets the stage for psychosis. Humanity has been living under these alien anti-life rules for centuries. One is taught to hate one's self and feel shame for being human; for being alive. These very religions set these people up to do what they do, then like cowards, they blame Satan instead of taking responsibility for their own actions. Satan has nothing to do with them or their actions. They are the products of their sick religion. Who put these sick teachings into their heads? Who imposed unnatural alien standards into these peoples' lives for them to live by? Satan has nothing to do with any of these sick teachings or laws, but whenever someone reacts from a lifetime of being steeped in this insanity, Satan gets the blame. LOOK TO THE SOURCE! Blame shifting is glaringly apparent in the story of \"Faust\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Faust sells his soul to Mephistopheles. Again, looking closely, Mephistopheles did no wrong. The Christian Church was the one punishing and condemning everyone in the story; punishing people for being human. The Christian alien \"God\" and his religion have an intense hatred of humanity and anything human. In the end of the story, again, Satan is blamed. This is so typical. Father Satan is the only one who understands humanity and accepts us as we are. He doesn't try to make us into something we're not. People who follow the Christian teachings of the alien enemy, condemning themselves for being human are a threat to themselves and society, as history and the tragedy above, so blatantly illustrate. Only when these sick alien religions are completely destroyed, will humanity ever be able to succeed. 284"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The Truth About Human Sacrifice Christianity has a long track record of blaming and accusing Satan and Satanists of everything they themselves do and promote. The nazarene is a human blood sacrifice they repeatedly celebrate during every Christian mass or service. The Catholic Church being true to its mission of destroying and removing all spiritual knowledge went on an all out rampage of mass murder and torture unequaled in all of recorded history. See \"Inquisition,\" and Malleus Malficarum; also known as \"The Witch’s Hammer.\" Examples include: Christians proved that a human being, skinned alive can survive until the skin is removed to the waist. Many innocent people were slowly boiled to death, to prolong the torture. This hideous list goes on and on. Extreme pain can cause anyone to do or say anything. Unfortunately, many \"confessions\" obtained under extreme torture are to this day assumed to be valid and used by the Christian Church as a tool to frighten people and enforce their lies. So much knowledge of a spiritual nature was systematically removed, cutting humanity off from its origins. This knowledge was replaced with false doctrines that incited fear and worked to turn everyone against the truth. Elaborate horror stories and sick twisted information became the norm as these were deliberately heaped upon any religion outside of Christianity. Racial and cultural memory is a fact. Those who look to alternatives find little if anything of a positive nature concerning Satan. Anything that does not conform with the Judeo/Christian concept of Satan is vehemently suppressed in the mainstream bookstores and media. Misinformation concerning living blood sacrifice, mutilation of self and others, drug abuse and self-degeneration is easily and readily available. People, who believe this sick garbage often commit so called \"occult crimes.\" See Christian Censorship. Christianity is responsible for all of the \"occult crimes,\" NOT Satan or his Demons! As one can see with the inquisition, the torture was severe enough to force one into saying anything. Slavery, gang rape, genocide, cannibalism, sexual perversion, eating of feces, are all a major part of the Judeo/Christian Bible. One heinous accuser and interrogator of \"witches,\" Benedict Carpzov, read the xtian bible \"53 times.\" He also authored a manual \"Practica Rerum Criminalum\" advocating the use of extreme torture for \"suspects.\" It is more than obvious to see where all these sick ideas come from. Ancient spiritual texts given to us from the Gods were destroyed and replaced with this sick, meaningless, literary filth, designed to keep psychic power in the hands of a select few. As for sacrifice, this applies to time, effort and creativity. The joy of serving Satan is well worth any sacrifice. The more we do for Father Satan, the more he does for us. The stigma of human sacrifice must be removed from Satanism. This does nothing but make Satan look undesirable and perpetuate the stereotype of our people being looked upon as loonies and psychos, when this is so far from the truth. Occult crimes are not a part of Satanism. Satan, himself referred to the small percentage of fools who do this as \"lunatics.\" \"Living Sacrifice is not a part of Satanism\" -Erzulie-Freda-Dahomey -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 285"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"With Satan Again Many people who are new to Satanism are concerned about whether they belong or whether Satan will accept them. I have found many of us have been with him before, in previous lives. He has placed many of his people here at this time because the earth is reaching the end of the Age of Pisces.* Major transforming changes will take place. I look back through my life, even my early pre-school years and I can now clearly see I was always of Satan. I was born with a mark, an unusual birthmark. I was drawn to the occult from an early age. A strong interest in the occult and Satanism can indicate one has already set foot on the left hand path in previous lifetimes. We were somehow different and never really fit in. Other religions do not work for children of Satan. My daughter was harassed by xians when I was living apart from her up in Mpls. She told me one day she tried praying to the nazarene (she was only nine years old at the time) and she noticed bad things began to happen. When she went to Father Satan, she immediately had her prayers answered and was happy. Contact with Demons also extends into past lives. They will usually make contact again with us in this one. Some of us go back many, many lifetimes in the service of Satan. *I wrote this article several years ago. Since then, Satan has reincarnated every soul that was in Hell, here to earth to do battle. All of these souls are of Satan and will fight for him in the coming years against the enemy. Satan accepts most of the people who come to him. He does not accept those who are dishonest with him, think they can try to use him or come to him for alternative purposes. Satan is very strong on honesty in that anyone who goes to him must be honest with him. People who think they can lie to him, show him and his Demons disrespect or use him in some way are in for a rude awakening. Magickal Practice Back in 1534, Benvenuto Cellini, an Italian Renaissance painter wanted to experience a \"magickal operation.\" He met with a Sicilian priest versed in the art of ritual magick, a friend Vincentio Romoli, a 12-year-old boy, and a second magician, accompanying the priest. Cellini wanted the love of a woman. Of all the places to choose for a ritual, they went to the Roman Coliseum. They cast a nine-foot circle and after an hour and a half, some spirits showed up and communicated to the group. They related that Cellini would have his love within one month. Then something went terribly wrong. More and more spiritual entities kept coming and then began getting aggressive. Within a short time, \"there were too many spirits present.\" The 12-year-old boy screamed, \"They were all being menaced by a million of the fiercest men they had ever seen.\" \"Four giants, fully armed, were trying to force their way into the circle.\" The child cried out that \"the Coliseum was on fire and that flames were rolling towards them.\" The group huddled together in terror, the magician threw more asafoetida on the fire in piles, and after a while, the spirits left in a fury. The group stayed huddled until morning and only a few spirits 286"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"remained \"and these at a distance.\" Upon leaving and running home, a couple of spirits chased them.

A proper environment with energy that is in tune with the goals of the ritual is important, obviously unwanted influences can affect a ritual or magickal operation for the worst. Music, thoughts, recalling past experiences or fantasies are important as well to creating a mood and environment supportive to the goals of the ritual. There are No Meditators in Satanism I am writing this sermon in reply to a letter posted to the Teens for Satan e-group concerning someone who was using Satanism and a feigned relationship with Satan to manipulate other people. The victims were young and unknowing. THE SATANIC CLERGY IS HERE FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT ONLY- NO ONE COMES BETWEEN US AND OUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH SATAN IN ANY WAY. THERE ARE NO MEDIATORS IN SATANISM! All it takes is one person who has a little intelligence and manipulative ability than the average person. Manipulative ability can be obtained while doing prison time. The ex-con then gets out and looks for those who are young or vulnerable to prey on. He/she more than likely uses drugs, although less than his/her followers who he/she remains in control of and with what these individuals advocate, if they haven't already been to prison, they will more than likely wind up there. Drugs are part of the control. Charles Manson learned this in prison and applied it to his followers. He did lesser amounts of the drugs while his followers got stoned out of their minds. This was one way he manipulated them. Most are now spending the rest of their lives in prison. Another letter was posted in the Teen group today. A girl is a virgin. She is comfortable with this. Her friend was wondering whether she would have to \"lose her virginity in order to become a Satanist.\" THE POINT IS- REMEMBER TRUE SATANISM IS ABOUT BEING YOURSELF AND BEING FREE. NO ONE IS EXPECTED TO DO THINGS THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH OR ANYTHING THAT IS NOT A PART OF THEIR NATURE. There are books written about magickal practice, I believe some by Aleister Crowley. These teachings instruct the readers that they must do certain things to break down barriers. This is utter bullshit and I equate it to walking out in front of a large truck in order to see what it feels like to get run over (if one survives). I am adept. I have never had to resort to any of this misinformation and garbage. Neither should anyone else. There are many different ways of empowering one's self and overcoming limitations, both physical and psychic, without having to resort to harmful actions. For example, advanced martial arts training gives one an enormous amount of power. This, when properly directed and applied can accomplish all kinds of feats. Most martial artists do not have the knowledge of how to apply this power outside of physical combat. We Satanists do. People who use kids or claim to have an \"in\" with the Devil in order to manipulate others and feed off 287"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"their energies are in reality very weak. The ONLY initiation one needs is between one's self and Satan. No \"High Priest/ess\" or anyone else should have any control or power over another person. Satanic clergy offer guidance and support- that is it. Members of the Satanic priesthood are gifted people who can act as mediums in imparting knowledge, BUT IF YOU ARE EVER IN DOUBT, GO TO SATAN YOURSELF. IF SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT FOR YOU, THEN DON'T ACCEPT IT. REMEMBER, AS A SATANIST, THE ONLY ONE WITH AUTHORITY IS SATAN HIMSELF. WE DO NOT ANSWER TO ANY HUMAN BEINGS. The Truth About Satan One of the most important things we can do as Satanists, is to establish a strong relationship with Satan. Many people look to books, writings, and other information about him. This opens a door, but instills many mistaken assumptions, that later upon meeting him and getting to know him, we find are false and confusion ensues. There have been so many lies, slander, and so much misinformation written and presented about Father Satan. Nearly all, if not entirely, this has been invented and spread by his enemies, people who don't know him, people out to make a fast buck and people indoctrinated with xian or other right hand path teachings. These lies have shaped many of our views concerning Satan. I receive many e-mails from people who have been misinformed and expect Satan to be a certain way. Take the Satanic Bible and the advocation of greed. I can tell you from experience, Satan is not greedy. We can easily see how greedy the xian churches are. Much of what the false enemy god is, is blamed on Satan as a distraction. True Satanism is not a trip through Disneyland. True Satanism is about personal evolution; becoming and evolving into a god. Satan helps us out in our lives with whatever we need, but in contrast to the many stories, he does not bestow extreme riches, fame and fulfill every wish in exchange for one's soul. When we give our souls to Satan, he assists us along the left hand path, bestowing upon us much knowledge, wisdom and personal power that will enable us to evolve and advance to godhead. When we die, we will no longer be just a spirit, we will emerge much more powerful and if we reincarnate, we will be born into a higher existence. In advancing to become a god, one's life will change for the better. One will no longer have to tolerate injustice as one will have serious power and understanding, way beyond that of the average person, with the ability to heal one's self and affect one's environment, influence and even control others. One advances by living life to the fullest, pushing one's self past physical, psychological, mental and spiritual limitations and overcoming boundaries. Inactivity and abstinence lead to degeneration. The human body is a perfect example. Muscles that are unused, atrophy. A mind that is unused becomes dull and stupid. The same can be said for the human soul. Idiocy I wrote this sermon a long time ago when I was new. Much has happened since then. This sermon 288"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"concerns spiritual abuse. The Demons are no longer bound. Five dedicated priests of Satan performed energy work on each of the Demons by connecting our souls to theirs over a four-month period. The Goetic Demons are not monsters we found, but important and popular Gods, many of which are Ancient Egyptian. Anyone who is foolish enough to call up a Demon using the abusive methods taught in the popular grimiores such as the \"Key of Solomon\" will be in for a rude awakening. There is so much literary trash filling the bookstore shelves concerning the occult and magickal practice. Many so-called esoteric societies and orders are nothing more than xians as they honor and work directly with Jehova’s angels, use xian and Hebrew symbols and practice spirit abuse. I read one of these books written on Goetic evocation.* In preparation to \"calling up a Demon,\" the author who is nothing more than an abusive sorcerer describes in grave seriousness all of the senseless daily rituals, prayers to \"YHVH,\" special diets, sexual abstinence, ritual bathing and fumigation. In addition, this foolish individual is terrified of the Demon he is so intent upon abusing. After the abuser’s repeated and exhausting attempts, the Demon finally appears, some months down the line and roars, scaring the holy shit out of the abuser and his partner. \"Thou Fools!\" the Demon roared. This author is so stupid and spiritually ignorant; he can't even see that the Demon is toying with him. The spiritually abusive author trembles in the confines of a 9-foot circle, along with his partner. The book reads on and after repeated attempts using coercion, threats, and so forth, the author is able to secure a few more visits and becomes bold enough to demand financial assistance. The Demon replies that he is \"unable to come through,\" as he has \"no power over the economy in this day and age. All the author got out of the experience was lies, double talk and much wasted energy. The author said the experience \"took everything out of him,\" aging him physically, mentally and spiritually. He got what he deserved! These fools never stop to think that in death, there is no protective 9-foot circle and when one's soul leaves one's body permanently, the Demons they have made enemies of will be waiting. The energy of a human spirit is nothing compared to the power of a Demon. I know because I have invoked both Demons and deceased human souls. When we go to Satan with a pure heart (total honesty), we are rewarded with knowledge and spiritual wisdom that few are ever able to receive. Demons appear to me on my altar, speak to me at various times, and give me advice and support very often. They just come to me. I don't even have to ask, NOT TO FORGET TO MENTION MONEY! I don't know how many times I have found or walked into money. I have never gone without. It is also comforting for me to know I have real spirit friends who look out for me. I will be happy meeting them when death comes. I always treat the Demons with extreme respect and always try to give something back in gratitude. I have found in my relationship with Father Satan, one of the most important things to him is honor. Satan hates phonies, hypocrites, liars, weakling cowards and people whose word is no good. Satan is strong on commitment and above all, honesty. You make a promise to Father Satan and he will take you up on it, keeping his end of the deal as well. I was surprised to have Demon friends I never even met or summoned, offer their assistance when I was having problems. Andras, who has a reputation for killing those who try to summon him, appeared to me and offered to help me. The reason he has been upset is because of the extreme disrespect and spiritual abuse he and other Demons been shown for centuries by idiots, such as the author of the above mentioned book. In addition to the Demons who suffered horrendous abuse (worse than the above), at the hands of this scum for centuries, these abusers extend their abuse to other beings such as elementals, pixies and other astral beings. Abusive sorcerers are hated everywhere and in death and their next incarnation, they will pay. Satanism is the only way to true spirituality. In finishing, I would like to add, there is little or no need for props, OTHER, than of course, those shown out of respect, such as incense to sweeten the air, candles, an altar and other tokens of respect. I always bathe before a ritual out of respect to Father Satan and wear a clean robe. 289"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Demons don't need \"a license to depart.\" This is as insulting as the 9-foot circle. Remember, we are Satanists and the Demons are our friends. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich *Goetic Evocation: The Magician's Workbook Volume 2 by Steve Savedow, second printing, 1999 The author wrote of his experience in summoning Bim/Bune. Many Satanists have met Bune. She is friendly and helpful when shown the proper respect and summoned through Satan. The sad thing is these Demons are friendly beings and they have been viciously abused for centuries under the direction of those alien angels and the related alien entities that operate as the fictitious Jehova, and who work through right hand path sorcerers. Knowledge There is overwhelming evidence the humanity has been the victim of an alien race for thousands of years masquerading as “Jehova.” Unfortunately, most people have a blind spot to this as most of the world is under the spell of xianity, Judaism and Islam. We have advanced in technology and science, but as far as magickal and spiritual power go, we are nowhere as knowledge of the spirit world has been systematically and vehemently suppressed and controlled for centuries in order to keep this power in the hands of a few. The enemy religions have succeeded in preventing humanity from developing and evolving spiritually. Our knowledge and application of mind power and magick are minimal. If one helps a hatching chick from its eggshell, or an emerging butterfly from its cocoon, they will be damaged forever. The muscles and coordination used to work their way out at this critical stage enable the creatures to become strong and healthy. The enemy religions preach to \"have faith.\" In other words, don't do a thing! Don't question, just \"have faith.\" Father Satan teaches us to stand on our own two feet and to become strong and question everything. Only through doubt can we learn the facts. True witchcraft and Satanism go together as the word \"witch\" means \"wise one.\" Satan teaches us how to empower ourselves spiritually and he grants us the knowledge to use this power. We are aware that humans can throw a curse but just think of the power behind a God throwing a curse, or many Gods for that matter. In spite of technological breakthroughs and advancements, the human race is nowhere in regards to mind/spiritual power and the use of real magick. The enemy religions have done a job, seeing to it that we don't advance or evolve in this area as they condemned witchcraft and turned most of humanity away from the only one who is willing to help us, Father Satan. By preaching helplessness, self-sacrifice, denial, doing NOTHING, being a victim, suffering for so- called \"sins,\" punishment and all of the suicidal teachings that go along with this, they have set us up for doom. The survival of a species depends on the ability to DEFEND itself and THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY FIGHT BACK AND DESTROY ITS ENEMIES! The human race as a whole is completely helpless when it comes to psychic and spiritual warfare. Satan and the Original Gods have been trying to help us. Only through Satan, can we truly advance spiritually. Satanism is the ONLY religion that does not preach helplessness. One can never be strong enough. Forget about where other people are at in regards to inner strength. Most are damning themselves. Weak people only drag us down if we let them. Both eastern and western religions alike destroy the human spirit. They preach self-blame, self-loathing, shame, self-mutilation, pain, atonement for \"sins\" and other destructive ideologies that are designed to kill and corrupt the human spirit. By 290"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"following these false religions, people damn themselves while Gabriel and his alien ilk laugh with hatred at humanity, and reap energy from souls. Much of the information available today in the form of \"New Age\" teachings has been infested with the same suicidal anti-life teachings. Wicca is a corrupted version of the old religions with the same message- just be a victim! Any attempts to take any self-initiated action are met with warnings about “karma,\" \"the threefold law of return,\" \"the ten fold,\" and other teachings of fear used to create slaves. People who preach this garbage fall right into the hands of the enemy that works through them to set others up as victims who believe this insanity. The sorry reality is humanity, as a whole knows nothing about spiritual empowerment and the use of magick. Due to centuries of not using any of this ability, we are not evolved. We cannot defend ourselves spiritually and this is serious. We have been indoctrinated to be helpless. The enemy religions have also done a job at destroying spirituality, turning it into something ugly on the one hand and something of a sorry joke on the other. The atheistic scholars scoff and laugh at the occult, leaving out a very important key to the advancement of humanity. These religions are a stepping off point to atheism. This is what the enemy wants. Atheists can be easily manipulated using psychic powers, as they don’t believe in the astral world. This way, power can be kept in the hands of a few human beings who make slaves out of the rest of humanity. There are reports concerning how the Vatican made a deal with the alien greys. They deliver the souls of the deluded Catholics in exchange for wealth and power. The greys use the souls for energy. We Satanists are very important, we know the truth, but knowing isn't enough. We need to keep learning and applying what we learn. The more we do, the more we can do. Study, learn, and apply what you learn, the Satanic way, without fear. The fight is not over. The enemy religions are the funeral wreath of humanity and must be destroyed. Most of us know natural law- the strong survive the weak. All of the technology in the word won't save our asses, if we can't fight back spiritually. All aspects of magick are essential; develop your mind and the ability. Putting a curse on another human is one thing, try going up against a god. Limitations are not a part of Satanism. Sorry for What? A Catholic priest took out a 12-year-old boy, whose father had just committed suicide, for ice cream. The priest used the opportunity to rape him. All we hear from the xians is excuses, excuses, excuses... Their own bible reads: \"Ye shall know them by their fruits.\" Not one good thing has come out of xianity or the xian church. Things that appear to be good are always tainted in some way. Everything that has to do with xianity is negative and the xians can't hide it. As for so called xian \"charity,\" the Red Cross, United Nations and Social Welfare departments, to name a few, have done much, much more, without the obsessive proselytizing and the demanding of one's soul in return for basic survival needs. We hear horror stories of how people turn to the nazarene. There is nearly always fear, near death, desperation or some other negative factor involved. Their prophets and angels always bring ill omens and messages of misfortune. Angels are notorious for preying upon children, then the children wind up dead. The Fatima incident is just as bad with the alien virgin bitch predicting the destruction of humanity and an early death of one of the three children there. * 291"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Satan came into my life when things were going good (they still are) and I was happy. He has always been and is a very uplifting and positive presence in my life. To this day, I don't have so much as one negative thing to say about him. All of his works are positive, helpful, and loving.** The same thing I can say for the Demons I have established relationships with. I was walking down the street some time ago, thinking about the worthless xian religion. Anyone who knows Father Satan knows he has a sense of humor. Father Satan said to me in my head sarcastically \"Everyone always has to be sorry.\" This made me laugh. The professional victim nazarene always expects everyone to be so sorry. In truth, it is the nazarene who should be sorry. There are things I have done in my life that I regret, but I am sorry to those of whom I committed the wrong acts against, *not* the stupid nazarene and nefarious alien company! What I had done at that time was done because of a lack of knowledge. I wouldn't do anything like this now because I KNOW BETTER. Who's responsible for the ignorance of humanity? Who is responsible for depriving mankind of knowledge when Satan wanted us to have knowledge?? In the end, who is really responsible for all the suffering and crimes and misery? Not humanity. When we have regrets about the past and how we should have done some things differently, the main reason is because we didn't have the knowledge at the time. If we did, none of this would have happened and things would have worked out all right for everyone concerned. - High Priestess Maxine Dietrich *The aliens who are behind the program of xianity are part of a movement called “The Intergalactic Federation.” The IGF’s agenda is one of “non-interference.” They plan to stand idly by while humanity blows itself to smithereens with nuclear weapons. The visit from the virgin bitch is typical of the IGF. There is a theme of negative prophesy while the sadistic aliens stand by and watch, not lifting a finger to help. In most cases, children are involved and preyed upon. The alien greys and enemy Nordics (angels) who have an insatiable hatred of humanity work with the IGF. Satan and the Original Gods are from Orion. The IGF is at war with Orion. The IGF works through many of the “New Age” people and mystics. The IGF aliens do not bother to help their human lackeys when they are having problems and in addition, they are sadistic and tell them of their misfortunes before they occur. Gifted humans such as Franz Bardon who worked for the IGF are prohibited from using their powers freely, even if this means saving their own lives or the life of a loved one. Upon their death, they are absorbed into “the light.” The light is also called “The One” and is a mass of harvested human souls used by the alien greys. There have been reports the Vatican made a deal with the greys- wealth and power in exchange for souls. This explains why the Catholic Church works relentlessly to suppress human spiritual advancement and is nothing but dead materialism devoid of any spirituality. Satan and his Demons do not give negative prophesy. If you ever experience an entity telling you something bad is going to happen, you can be sure this is not Satan or any of the Demons. Satan does not stand by and watch us suffer needlessly. He saved my life literally more than once. He, himself stepped in for me. Whenever I experienced severe attacks from angels, Azazel appeared immediately and chased them away. All of us experience setbacks as this is life, but when things get serious, he is right there for his disciples. I had an astrologically devastating year in July 2004- June 2005. On the night of April 30th of 2004, Satan spoke to me at length during my ritual. I expressed my concerns about the coming year. I had seen this year coming for over ten years. It was the year I was to 292"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"die as I can predict death astrologically. He informed me that he would be handling the energies for the coming year and not to worry. He said I would experience some setbacks and “not to lose heart.” The setbacks were quite minor given the magnitude of my planetary aspects and in many respects, the year turned out to be joyous for me. This was a miracle. I am grateful to him beyond words. ** I wrote the above sermon several years ago. To this day, Satan has always been very positive in every way for me. He is the most lovable being I have ever known. Satanism Popular fiction literature, movies, and media have about as much understanding of Satan and Satanism, as do the xians. One of the most widespread misconceptions is that upon making a commitment to Satan, one can expect all kinds of free goodies, like a trip through Disneyland, so to speak. People who believe this are in for a rude awakening. Satanism is the elite of religions. Like Special Forces in the military, we are those with special abilities, those who are feared and respected by everyone. The end goal of Satanism is that of becoming a god. Unlike all the other religions that repress the human spirit, Satanism liberates and empowers the soul. After we perform the dedication ritual, Satan begins investing in us. We discover talents and creative abilities we never even knew we had. We become much stronger and more confident through striving to put these to use and in bettering ourselves. Contrary to what Anton LaVey wrote in the Satanic Bible, Satan does not approve of sloth, laziness, apathy (not caring about anything), drug abuse, and being unmotivated. LaVey, himself worked hard. This isn't to say we aren't free to do as we please in our off time, but Satan expects us to make something of ourselves. Anyone who has been a Satanist long enough knows that making Father Satan angry with us is most unpleasant to say the least. Satan is a good Father to his children. He gets on to us when we are doing something destructive or detrimental to ourselves. He motivates and guides us to be the best we can be. Inner strength and confidence come from knowing one are able to defend ones self and not have to rely on others. Being an adept at all aspects magick takes time, effort, and dedication. Controlling our own minds, instead of our minds controlling us is not easy. Our minds were designed to undermine us. This is obvious. Our minds are structured to keep us ignorant and as slaves, preventing us from becoming as the Gods. Our plethora of unstructured thoughts dissipates into nothing and we are amnesiacs when it comes to former lives. The education and talents we once had in previous lifetimes are lost and we must be relearn everything again, over and over. An uncontrolled mind can drive one to unnecessary worry, stress, disturbing thoughts and in the worst cases, insanity. Weak people suffer more in the long run. Fears, insecurities, and uncontrolled emotions are free to torment us day and night. Those who refuse to better themselves are at the mercy of fate. Fate can be cruel and unforgiving. \"Today is NOT the first day of the rest of your life.\" Every action you have taken up to this point has established a foundation and pattern in your life. This isn't to say this is permanent, as everyone can change, but change will not come without plenty of effort. Unlike those who are without, we have Father Satan to direct and guide us. Father Satan knows everything about us, inside and out and where we are headed. He is all-knowing, and can save us from 293"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"making some very serious mistakes, but those who do not care and make no effort to better themselves can find themselves without. Father Satan is always there to help and guide those of us who make an effort to better ourselves. Satanists are encouraged to live life to the fullest, to grow and become and to empower ourselves. This is true spirituality, unlike the other religions that destroy the soul by advocating their followers do nothing and abstain from life. As a result, they become nothing. Free Thought Everyone knows free thought is the ability to think for one's self, but how many people actually apply this? Only when you can completely free your mind, will you be able to come into your own and know yourself. How to think, what to think, what to believe, what our likes, our dislikes, our concepts of right, wrong, good and evil are, are constantly being programmed by the media, peer pressure and those in power. Those in power can refer to the government, parents, family, educational institutions and textbooks, the system, the medical association and so forth. Many live their lives by the values of others and as a result, they never come to know themselves. People are TOLD what to think and believe. The television is a good example. Canned laughter implies something is supposed to be funny and it's OK to laugh. Background music lets the viewer know when he/she should get scared or anticipate something. Emotional scenes lead some people to tears. Life is much like this. One is supposed to obtain some form of approval for any and every thought and/or action. Take a look at the xian church. Everyone is repeatedly told this nefarious enemy of humanity is something \"good.\" In spite of the continuous and blatantly obvious signs to the contrary, most people actually believe this to be true. The xian bible is called the \"good book.\" This \"good book\" is full of mass murder, slaughter, torture, gang rape, prostitution, cannibalism, infanticide, mutilation, blood sacrifice, curses, feces, hatred, and every ugly thing know to humanity. It has incited war, slavery, bloodshed and destroyed the lives and mental health of billions. When we come to Satan, he opens the door to our spiritual cages and gives us a hand in getting out. The rest is up to us. He is always there for guidance and support, but above all, he wants us to be free. Satan, who is the True God, is the liberator of humanity. Ask yourself; what do I think? How do I feel? NOT how *SHOULD* I think, or what would someone else think, or what does everyone else think. We are all individuals. We all have different preferences and tastes. Just because someone else likes or dislikes something, that doesn't mean you as an individual should feel the same way. Whenever presented with a dilemma or something new, ask yourself the above questions. Satanism is free thought in the extreme, yet, so few are able to actually think for themselves. Now, of course, those in power are dead against free thought. Sheep are easily controlled. Personality tests are given to determine those who are a threat (think for themselves and don't conform). Though unaware, how we should think is drummed into our heads from the time we are born. Very few people really know themselves, in spite of living with themselves 24/7. This is really sad. It's not all that hard. Just remember to always and frequently ask yourself to start out with; do I think this is right or wrong for me? How do *I* feel about this? What is *my* opinion? There are no right or 294"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"wrong answers here. Just get to know yourself. This may take time, but in the end, you will experience the bliss of being free. Start completely deprogramming your mind today. All of us are programmed to greater or lesser degrees and most are not even aware of it. The Importance of Rituals As Satanists, rituals are one of the most important things we can do. When I was new, Satan impressed upon me the importance of regular rituals, as he is now doing with a close friend who recently converted. We have the best God there is and it is very important for us to let him know we appreciate him. Rituals are our personal time between Father Satan and ourselves, and are very good for the soul. Regular rituals can also provide an emotional release, or a time we can talk with Father Satan about concerns we have in our lives. He always hears us and he is always there to listen. Rituals also strengthen our relationship with him. I try to do rituals at least once a week. Most of my rituals involve much thanksgiving and worship. Father Satan always takes care of me and makes me very happy. Many fortunate things happen to me quite often and I am grateful. Many times, during the solitude of meditation, Satan will speak to us. I can feel his beautiful presence in my life every day. Ritual is also the best time to ask for something we need. Father Satan knows our deepest thoughts, feelings, and desires. He is probably the only one we can totally open up with in our lives and completely relate to as our total selves. He is the only one who completely understands us, as no other human being can. -High Priestess Maxine Answers Last night, I heard the song \"My Sweet Lord\" by ex-Beatle George Harrison on the radio. The focus of this song was \"Lord Krishna\" A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Many extremely wealthy and famous people have searched and searched for answers to the meaning of life. Harrison, in spite of his millions was not given any priority by Krishna Guru A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, thus the song. This is nothing new, as many are lost. Satan gives us knowledge and understanding. I know more now than I ever thought possible. This knowledge makes me feel secure, even though there is much more for me to learn. Knowledge itself is infinite. Knowledge is the key to everything. Understanding life, feeling confident along with a sense of direction is very important for both personal and spiritual evolution. Many yogis, martial artists and others have power, but they do not have the knowledge concerning how to use it. Without the knowledge, it is useless in many areas except for walking on hot coals like fakirs or breaking boards and bricks. 295"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Satan guides us to grow in power and shows us how we can use this power and be the best we can be. Most people do not have any spiritual answers. Life becomes confusing and meaningless. Depression, drug and alcohol abuse, confusion, insecurity and apathy are the condition of many, regardless of material wealth and fame. Satan is the giver of knowledge. We learn when we are ready. I have found Demons are the best teachers. What they can teach us is way beyond that of what any human knows. Time and patience are needed. We learn as we go along, are ready, and are open. Satan and his Demons are always there with answers to our questions and to help and guide us. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Life in the Fast Lane Most people, especially here in the USA, live life in the fast lane; fast food, high-speed cable, quick service, “I want it five minutes ago” and so forth. The spirit world does not work like this. I have to keep re-emphasizing: PATIENCE, PERSEVERANCE, and DEDICATION. I didn't see Demons or communicate with them until several months following my dedication ritual. I remember seeing Furackus and Elyth on my altar. This was some six months or more after my dedication. I didn't meet Azazel until nearly three months following seeing these two Demons. Azazel is my Chief Guardian Demon and I am very close to him. I never knew Lucifuge Rofocal was one of my Guardians either. He has a unique voice and slight accent. I remember he spoke to me when I was new, but I had no idea of who he was other than he was a Demon. Satan is strong on patience. He and his Demons have waited thousands of years for humanity. One does not just perform a ritual and here comes the Demon at the snap of ones fingers. Relationships are built up slowly, with patience, perseverance, and dedication. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich “Evil” There are people who talk the talk and want to play at being \"bad\" and \"evil.\" These people are intent on going on about how \"evil\" Satan is, yet they don't know him. Their ideas of so-called evil are nothing more than cultural concepts. Few have understanding of the meaning of the word “evil” and are simplistic in their thinking. Satan transcends \"good\" and \"evil.\" These individuals firmly adhere to the xian teachings concerning Satan. Deep down, they are really xians, not Satanists, as they follow the teachings of xianity. They rigidly live their lives according to their own specific cultural taboos. True Satanism is freedom, not living according to the restrictions of the xian teachings of what is *supposed* to be evil. They lack perspective and understanding. What is perceived as “evil” in one culture may be considered favorable in another. Satanism is deep, transforming spirituality that transcends the human concepts of good and evil. People who are hung up on Halloween, the boogey man, corpses and monsters have no understanding of Satan 296"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"or true Satanism. In order to be free, one must deprogram one’s mind. Only when one is able to see life through one’s own eyes, can one ascend to a higher level of understanding. Too many people are still carrying around the values society has programmed into them rather than seeing things through their own eyes and being their own person. When we give our souls to Satan (for those of us who choose to do this), a door is opened. This is a major step beyond the conformity that has been heaped upon us by society. This is where we transcend the black and white simplistic thinking and begin to see things through our own eyes. Music The Devil has always had the best tunes; this has been known for centuries. Along with literature, theatre, and art, the xian church has always regarded music with great suspicion, when it wasn't completely under their strict and oppressive control. Satan is master of the violin and flute. 18th century Italian composer Giuseppe Tartini was inspired when Satan appeared to him in a dream. He heard Satan playing the violin. He said it was the most beautiful music he had ever heard. It was \"indescribably beautiful.\" He immediately awoke and tried to write it down to copy it, but it never turned out the same way. He did the best he could to duplicate it. He published it and named it \"The Devil's Trill.\" 19th century violinist Niccolo Paganini came under intense suspicion of \"collaborating with the Devil.\" In other words, no one could write or play anything so beautiful without help from Satan. Here the xian church indirectly admits that the beauty of Satan outshines what they worship. Modest Mussorgsky composed \"A Night On Bald Mountain.\" The music portrayed a witches’ sabbat. In the original piece, Satan reigned triumphant at the climax, but this was too much for Mussorgsky's xian contemporaries. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov revised it, ending the piece with the ringing of a church bell. Satan also inspired Carl Orff in his dreams when he wrote \"Carmina Burana.\" This music is best known from the soundtrack of the movie, \"The Omen.\" Orff told his wife that he saw Demons many times in his dreams when he composed the music. Jazz is synonymous with Satan. The rhythmic beat, the dances the music inspires, and of course, it opened the door to rock and roll. Music has always been a great friend to humanity. Music is a tension reliever, as it relaxes the left (logical) side of the brain so that the creative right side can manifest itself in new ideas and solutions to things, in the same way meditation helps us. Satan can speak to us through the music. Music makes any activities more pleasant. Work becomes easier, a fast beat can get one going, a soothing beat can calm one's mood, and sexual intercourse to music can be blissful. William Blake once stated that all true poetry was the \"work of the Devil.\" Satan inspires creativity. He works to bring out creativity in all of his disciples. With Satan, we learn and grow as individuals. Each one of us is unique. The enemy wants everyone to be clones, drones and drabs. Take a look at the women under the Taliban, the xian Quakers, the Amish and the Hasidic jews with their strict rules on how to dress. There is no room for any personal creativity whatsoever. These religions desecrate and kill the human spirit, while 297"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"they enslave the soul. Satan stands for freedom and individuality. Islam Islam is an offshoot of xianity. This religion has brought untold suffering, wars, and misery upon the human race. Upon close examination, we find the same nefarious alien characters. The xian angel \"Gabriel,\" appeared to Mohammed and heaped on more of these anti-life teachings in the form of \"Islam,\" designed to further enslave humanity and to create more conflicts and wars. In contrast, Satan's angels, the Demons, teach and help humanity (if they are treated respectfully). \"You will know them by their works.\" Women are treated lower than animals in Islamic countries. I recall seeing a most horrendous photo of a small woman in Yemen with a tow truck chain pounded through her arm. Her \"crime\" was that she ran away from her abusive Islamic husband and was caught. Afghani women have to wear heavy garb covering their entire bodies. They look out of a little net. If they accidentally expose any skin, they are beaten with clubs by Islamic men. Islamic women must walk three feet behind their husbands on the streets. Only in times of war are they forced to walk three feet in front as there are land mines. Islamic women eat the leavings from the dinner plates of their husbands and any men guests their husbands have in their homes. They are treated lower than dogs. It is no wonder these people are so eager to kill themselves through suicide bombings. What kind of life is this? To treat significant others so heinously under the direction of a blood thirsty monster they call \"allah.\" They get to where they have to blow themselves up- where it this \"Allah\"? The Commandments of Satan Satan dictated the Al Jilwah directly to Yezidi prophet Sheik Adi in the 12th century. The Al Jilwah is the most important doctrine in Satanism and every Satanist should be familiar with its teachings. I asked Satan if the Al Jilwah was from him and he confirmed it was, and stated that the Muslims altered some of the Yezidi doctrines. I memorized the commandments some time ago, and they have always been of great help and comfort to me especially when I have experienced confusion. \"ALL MY TEACHINGS ARE EASILY APPLICABLE TO ALL TIMES AND ALL CONDITIONS.\" \"I TEACH AND GUIDE THOSE WHO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTION.\" \"I EXERCISE DOMINION OVER ALL CREATURES AND OVER THE AFFAIRS OF ALL WHO ARE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF MY IMAGE.

He snaps us into line, guides us, and directs us to what we need to do to be focused and happy. When we dedicate our souls to him, we are always under his protection and he is always there for us. Satan has ALWAYS been there for me. There were times when I was having problems and Father Satan came to me before I even had to ask and helped me out. It is very important to trust in Father Satan. He works with every one of us to establish trust. He is honest, truthful, and consistent and he keeps his word. He meets us more than half way. \"I ALLOW EVERYONE TO FOLLOW THE DICTATES OF HIS OWN NATURE, BUT HE THAT OPPOSES ME WILL REGRET IT SORELY.\" Satan wants us all to be happy individuals. We are all free to indulge our fetishes, personal tastes, preferences, and so forth. This is one of the many reasons we are happier than most. \"NO GOD HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MY AFFAIRS, AND I HAVE MADE IT AN IMPERATIVE RULE THAT EVERYONE SHALL REFRAIN FROM WORSHIPPING ALL GODS.\" Those who worship other Gods end up confused and are open to all kinds of influences. It is important to stay focused. As Satanists, our God is Satan and there is no need to call upon other gods. Demons act as protectors and direct us to be strong in Satan. They can also act as mediators as they work with us closely, but we do not worship them. \"WHEN TEMPTATION COMES, I GIVE MY COVENANT TO HIM THAT TRUSTS IN ME.\" Temptation usually comes in the form of fear. Some, mainly out of fear, have turned to the enemy. The enemy serves no purpose whatsoever in a happy life and should be avoided at all costs. \"I DO NOT ALLOW FRIENDLY ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE.\" As for associating with those who are without, how many times, just in this e-group* alone, have we read about or have been direct recipients of problems with Christians? Most Christians will try to convert us, especially if they know we are Satanists. Very few if any, will have a live and let live attitude towards a known Satanist. Nearly all will pray for us and this invites psychic harassment that can be more then just annoying. As for hard core Muslims, their practice has been if they cannot convert someone, they resort to murder. Many Yezidis have been murdered en masse by Muslims. \"NOR DO I DEPRIVE THEM THAT ARE MY OWN AND THAT OBEY ME OF ANYTHING THAT IS GOOD FOR THEM.\" Satan knows each and every one of us intimately and what is in our best interests. Most of what we ask him from him, he gives to us and we are happy. Satan is our Creator God and he can see things we cannot. He can see if someone or something is bad for us or will do us harm. Trusting in him is very important, he has all of the facts; we don't. \"I APPEAR IN DIVERSE MANNERS TO THOSE WHO ARE FAITHFUL AND UNDER MY COMMAND.\" 300"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Individuality is very important to Satan and he wants for each of us to grow and develop our own uniqueness. He wants us to be ourselves. All of us are very important to him in our own special way. With Satan, what one individual may experience, another may not and visa-versa. Over all, most of us have had many similar experiences, spiritual occurrences and have seen the same things. \"I LEAD TO THE STRAIGHT PATH WITHOUT A REVEALED BOOK; I DIRECT ARIGHT MY BELOVED AND CHOSEN ONES BY UNSEEN MEANS.\" Satan comes to us. We don't have to spend our lives pouring over reams and reams of material, trying to make sense of it, in an attempt to find \"God.\" Satan interacts with every one of us in his own way. He guides each of us and directs us so we can have fulfilling and rewarding lives. \"THREE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME AND I HATE THREE THINGS.\" These three things are the Christian trinity and the three religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. All three of these religions condemn and preach against Satan and replace him with their false “God.” Misfortune comes in threes. These three have told lie upon heinous lie about Satan and his Demons who are the original Gods. They have heaped untold suffering and misery upon humanity and the earth. They are our enemy! \"THOSE WHO KEEP MY SECRETS SHALL RECEIVE THE FULFILLMENT OF MY PROMISES.\" Because Satan appears to us in diverse ways, he may reveal some of his secrets to us as individuals. We will know what they are. He has done things for me and has revealed things to me. There are certain secrets he has entrusted to me to keep to myself. Remember, Satan treats us all as individuals. Keeping his secrets is very important. If you are ever in doubt concerning whether or not to reveal something, just ask Satan and he will either tell you or you will receive a sign from him. \"IT IS MY DESIRE THAT ALL MY FOLLOWERS UNITE IN A BOND OF UNITY, LEST THOSE WHO ARE WITHOUT PREVAIL AGAINST THEM.\" Satan wants all of his people to work together and unite. We must put aside our personal differences and work together as a team. The Christian “God” and company work to create conflict, discord, and division among Satanists: Mark 3: 26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. Unity is of paramount importance, “One alone, together strong.” Satan does not approve of infighting between his people. Those who experience conflicts with a brother or sister in Satan should go to Satan concerning this and he will handle the situation. Those who throw curses at or slander other Satanists will invite the wrath of Beelzebub. Beelzebub handles those who create problems and disunity and the consequences can be quite unpleasant. \"REJECT ALL THE TEACHINGS AND SAYINGS OF SUCH AS ARE WITHOUT. I HAVE NOT TAUGHT THESE TEACHINGS, NOR DO THEY PROCEED FROM ME.\" As for rejecting the teachings and sayings of such as are without, the saying “Garbage in; Garbage 301"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"out,” describes this perfectly. One only needs to look at the Christians, Muslims, and company to see how lost and unbalanced they are spiritually. Beneath the Christian smiley mask, there is misery inside, regardless of how they may try to deny it and lie. The teachings of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others of the RHP are anti-life, devoid of any true spirituality and lead their adherents down the path of spiritual impoverishment, lies, loss, and confusion. \"O YEA THAT HAVE BELIEVED IN ME, HONOR MY SYMBOL AND MY IMAGE, FOR THEY REMIND YOU OF ME.\" When I was new to Satanism, I was reading Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible. At the time, I had hardly any furniture and I would line my books up against the wall, on the floor. I did this with my Satanic Bible. Something would not let me go to sleep and kept on nagging at me to get the Satanic Bible up off the floor. I got up and put it on a shelf in my closet. Since then, I purchased several bookcases. We must ALWAYS treat sacred books, jewelry, or anything else that symbolizes Father Satan with the greatest care and respect. Early on, Father Satan impressed upon me, the importance of the Al Jilwah. I memorized much of it and it has helped me immeasurably. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich *Many sermons on this website were first posted to the Joy of Satan e-group. BACK TO SERMONS People in Our Lives We Satanists are a small group as far as numbers go, but we are growing more and more every day when compared to the mainstream religions. Unfortunately, there are people in our lives who are thoroughly indoctrinated with xian and other enemy teachings. Holidays, family reunions and other get-togethers can be trying times for many of us. Xians feel strong in a group of xians to back them up, but when they experience a confrontation alone, few are brave. I have seen these people fold when lacking the necessary support. They are so weak and dependent. More than one xian has quit a job because of me. They create conflicts they can't handle. Most talk the talk and that's about it. I was an atheist for over fifteen years. I hated xianity and its teachings much more than the average atheist, though. My \"blasphemies\" would literally make people cringe. Several years ago when I worked third shift at a 24-hour restaurant, a wimp would come in and sit at the counter. One night this wimp butted in on a conversation between a LaVeyan Satanic teenager and myself that did not concern him. I gave him a piece of my mind and left, as my shift was over and he shut up. As soon as I was out the door, (my son also worked there as a waiter) the xian wimp approached him and started up about \"god.\" My son shouted, \"FUCK GOD!\" The guy right away got scared. Most xians are weak, whether they are co-workers, family, or whatever. Rarely will you ever see one stand alone against several of us. Of course, when xians are in a group against one person, many times the situation is different. I had three xians threaten physical violence after they accosted me outside of a public library. I told them what I thought of their nazarene. Of course, a heated verbal exchange ensued and all three kept parroting the same inane phrases repeatedly with no logical or rational argument. The 302"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"only thing they had to offer was potential physical violence and nothing more. One of these clowns was a pastor. I found this later when I recognized him on a TV commercial advertising his church. I refused to back down and when they saw the confrontation would lead to more, they left. I have argued with enough of them, leaving them with nothing to say every time. They start arguments they can't finish. Most of these xians are going nowhere. Satan gives us strength they don't have. I look at them and see how weak most of them are, how they are needy and dependent on the approval of others. This sort of thing leads them to xianity in the first place. Satan, by his nature walks alone. There is no petty ass kissing or conforming to the \"expectations\" and standards of others. We are an elite group. We bow to no one. We have the power to tear them up and spit them out and they know it too. Xians tell me they will pray for me, I tell them I will pray for them in return, and then they get worried. I've seen firsthand what has become of the fools who have been stupid enough to \"pray\" for me. Satan and the Demons punish those who harass us, not always right away, but just give it some time. For those of whom we really care about and love, remembering them in our rituals can work wonders. As for those we are indifferent to; who cares? Who needs them or their petty foolishness? They don't even exist as far as I am concerned. They are so weak the silence bothers them. It leaves me in peace. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich The Truth About Aliens When I was new, I asked Satan during a ritual \"Who are you?\" I had no clue. I believed him to be some sort of spirit, but the voices in my head and my interaction with him indicated he is a real being. Very soon after in less than 24 hours following the ritual, I came across the Luciferian Liberation Front. I knew this was an answer to my question. I have spent years studying a variety of occult subjects. In addition, I have had many experiences and have learned from the experiences of others, both clergy and laity. The evidence of alien extra- terrestrials is overwhelming. In the Egyptian images and monoliths, the pyramids are spaced and directed towards the constellation of Orion and the spaces between the pyramids correlate with the distance of the stars in the belt of Orion.¹ The Judeo/Xian Bible is chock full of BLATANT UFO activity. Many deluded individuals believe the xian \"god\" to be a perfect force, above the comprehension of any human being. The truth is- the Judeo/ Xian bible REPEATEDLY describes a jealous, wrathful, spiteful and hateful being- Yaweh/Jehova, with emotions no different from that of humans, though more negative in comparison. The indifference to suffering indicates cruelty. The alien entity is aware of the human emotions of wrath, anger, hatred and jealousy resulting in wars, murder and genocide that most human beings strive to avoid. The concept of \"love\" here is not understood and is missing. To the xian entity, it is merely a word used for control, nothing more. The entity, is obviously devoid of any sublime emotions, does not understand the concept of \"love.\" On one hand, the entity claims \"love\" for his followers, and on the other hand, with the slightest offense, this \"love\" can damn one to eternal burning and torture in a \"lake of fire.\" This is very alien to say the least. The Old Testament books, especially Genesis and Exodus are chock full of crimes against humanity such as the mass murder this entity perpetrated even against his own on a whim. It is a given, that everyone familiar with UFO's and aliens, knows greys and reptilians are devoid of emotion. Also, it is recorded in the xian bible, when Moses asked to see \"god's\" face- the alien replied 303"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"that no one could see him face to face- (Exodus 33: 20-23). Obviously, this being does not resemble a human being. Many of us have seen Satan. He has nothing to hide. Satan and his Demons, (as well as some of the \"angels\" of the xian bible and their cohorts) are of the aliens they call \"Nordics.\" Aleister Crowley's \"Illustrated Goetia\" published by DuQuette, Hyatt and Wilson, second edition, © 2000, has numerous illustrations. The illustrations of \"Lucifuge Rofocal\" and \"Vassago\" show beings with large bulbous heads. Now Lucifuge Rofocal is one of my Guardian Demons. I have seen him. He has a large bulbous head. He is obviously a hybrid of grey. He is friendly and has emotion, as a hybrid mix is unique. Valefor also is a Grey/Nordic hybrid. He has the large head, with greenish complexion; Clistheret who is a female is the same. I have never seen Vassago, but the illustration in the book supports what many of us have seen. Nordics are frequently seen accompanied by greys. These Nordics are those who are normally hostile to humanity. Azazel told me \"they are abominable\" (referring to the greys, when I asked about them communicating with him on a Ouija Board). I strongly suggest those of you who are skeptics to read: \"The Day After Roswell\" by Colonel Philip J. Corso, US Army, retired ©1997. The author exposes the entire story, with names, dates, facts and documents released under the freedom of information act. He was personally in charge of the Roswell files under the Army Research and Development at the Pentagon directly under Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau and was actively involved in the planning of project HORIZON. Corso explains the reality behind the \"Cold War\" where the USA and the USSR amassed nuclear weapons capable of destroying the Earth five times over. If either side employed these, mutual suicide for the entire planet would be the result. The truth is- both world powers were well aware of the alien threat, which in reality is a hostile one that threatens the life of everything and everyone on this planet. This is the reason human attempts to establish any meaningful contact with these entities have met with evasion. Both the USA and USSR worked behind the scenes to develop defense technology, not to be used on each other, as the media falsely claimed to shape public opinion and to delude the masses, but to be used in defense of the Earth from a potential alien attack. This was also the main reason for the Apollo Moon Mission in 1969. This mission was not just space exploration. The defense dept was interested in establishing a base on the Moon that would act as a reconnaissance post for the Earth. The large number of satellites orbiting the Earth serves the same purpose, that of protection. Corso concludes the book with documents. He explains how the technology recovered from the crash landing of the alien spacecraft in Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947 was salvaged and clandestinely distributed by the US Army to various civilian laboratories who employed top scientists. These scientists used reverse engineering to develop the high level of technology we have today. This technology enabled the building of the \"stealth bomber\" and other high tech military weapons used to deter the aliens from invading the Earth. The point is- we were successful in deterring them physically, but not psychically. Their strong telepathic influence is felt. The Christian religion and its cohorts provide these entities with the psychic energy they need. Close examination of the Roswell craft and the autopsies performed on the five greys who piloted the delta shaped UFO revealed their parasitical nature. The description of the entity called the \"ALL\" in the book \"The Watchers\" by Raymond E. Fowler, also supports the parasitical nature of these creatures that are devoid of emotion and how they thrive on the energy of souls. These creatures have tampered with genetic engineering and alteration to where they no longer have any genitals, sexual procreation, emotions or physical strength. The examination of the alien craft revealed no controls, no on/off switches or visible circuits within the 304"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"craft, only indentations shaped as the aliens' hand prints, like a hand print in wet cement outside of Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. These were where the aliens placed their hands, becoming an integrated part of the craft. They navigated the craft by using their own bioelectricity, powerful telepathy and telekinesis. The adjustable bands they placed on their heads to navigate the craft acted as thought amplifiers. Army officers upon examining them, placed them in position on their heads and the devices induced vivid colors, hallucinations and resulted in \"searing headaches.\" In addition, they found that these bands stimulated various areas of the brain. \"The Watchers\" by Raymond E. Fowler is very revealing concerning the grey involvement in the xianity scam and exposes \"the one.\" *See \"Jesus of Borg\". Most people are not aware of the higher purpose of Satanism. The Earth has been the target of a soul farm.² Satan is the \"Liberator of Humanity.\" Xianity and its cohorts are a hoax. Satan and his Demons are here to help us get out from under the position of being used as energy livestock in a slaughterhouse for alien consumption. The enemy Nordics who saw no use for humanity, following the completion of the mining project, sought to follow plan and have us all destroyed. Nephilim that \"took wives\" and taught humanity, such as Azazel and Set, were banished, cursed and condemned. (The above illustration depicts Set teaching a human how to use a bow and arrow). We are dealing with entities that have more psychic power, technology, intelligence and knowledge than we do. They don't age as we do; they have the knowledge and technology to have modified their DNA. Satan is over half a million years old. One can only imagine that to continue learning, experiencing life and empowering one's self for even 1,000 years, the level of knowledge and ability that would be reached; combine that with extremely advanced technology. For those of you who believe in spooks and are skeptic, I strongly suggest you read the above books, along with \"Extra-Terrestrials Among Us\" by George C. Andrews. \"The Day After Roswell\" reveals everything from the cover-up, to the promotion of yellow journalism stories to the real truth behind the \"Star Wars\" of the Regan Administration and the \"Cold War.\" This was largely a distraction and an excuse. Why would two world powers manufacture hundreds of nuclear warheads that would obliterate the entire Earth and result in mutual suicide? For many years, these ignorant spiritually deluded new age idiots have been crowing on and on concerning the \"sins\" of humanity and how we are a threat to the universe with our nuclear weapons and our aggression, while all those extra-terrestrials are so goddamned wonderful. They claim they 305"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"scout our military and weapons bases out of a altruistic concern for all life in the universe as we have become a threat to them resulting from our sinful ways. WRONG. These aliens have kept our defense systems under surveillance to see where we are at and just how vulnerable we are to a mass invasion. The USA and Russia both know this. These aliens have continually and aggressively acted to prevent us from space exploration, jamming our launch vehicles, satellites, causing mechanical problems and even preventing a few from being thrust into orbit. They have acted to jam our signals with buzzing and other electronic intervention. Their shooting across our radar detectors, creating blips and encouraging our air force to tail them; they are testing the speed of our aircraft and our maneuverability. They want to know exactly where we are technologically. These greys played cat and mouse games, and edged ever closer until there was a response. They have also attempted to disrupt worldwide communication and our defenses through electrical and magnetic field interference. Their employment of night vision devices would have been an advantage. The defense dept now has these and many other military technologies that are a threat to them. The USA and Russia planned in case of an alien attack, only half of the Earth would be sacrificed, if one nation was knocked out, the other could cover. General Douglas McArthur remarked to the New York Times in 1955 that the threat comes from out there. \"The nations of the world will have to unite for the next war will be an interplanetary war.\" An alien base was seen on the Moon by astronaut Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 fly-over and landing. Mercury 7 astronauts as have many others been tailed by UFO's. \"They didn't just shadow or track our aircraft in orbit; they buzzed us and tried to create such havoc with our communications systems that NASA more than once had to rethink astronaut safety in the Mercury and Gemini programs.\" The Apollo moon-landing program was ultimately abandoned because there was no way to protect our astronauts from alien threats. \"The alien spacecraft were also aggressively buzzing our frontline defenses in Eastern Europe, either looking for blind spots or weaknesses; probing our radar to see how quickly we responded.” While never disclosing it publicly, military intelligence analysts supported the view that Earth was already under some form of probing attack by one or more alien cultures that were testing both our ability and resolve to defend ourselves.\" \"Our only successes in defending against them, back in the 1950's and 1960's, occurred when we were able to get a firm tracking radar lock. Then when we locked our targeting radars on, the signals that missiles were supposed to follow to the target, it somehow interfered with their navigational ability, and the vehicles flight became erratic. If we were especially fortunate and able to boost the signal before they broke away, we could actually bring them down. Sometimes we actually got lucky enough to score a hit with a missile before the UFO could take any evasive action, which an Army air defense battalion did with an anti-aircraft missile near Ramstein Air force base in Germany in May of 1974. The spacecraft managed to crash-land in a valley. The craft was retrieved and flown back to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The Roswell crash was different. There was much speculation that it was a combination of the desert lightening storm and our persistent tracking radars at Alamogordo and the 509th that helped bring down the alien vehicle over the New Mexico desert in 1947.\" The new age focus on love, love, love and three fold bullshit and everything else. This is nothing more than a close relative of xianity that renders those who are stupid and deluded enough to follow it, helpless. Satan and his Demons are trying to help us. The greys possess tremendous telepathic ability and the devices to amplify it. The xian and RHP religions are a fraud.

We have survived centuries without all of the wealth and materialism of the enemy religions. A gathering in the forest, on the beach, in the home of a friend, Satan's followers are here because we want to be. We have made a choice. We come to worship out of love, NOT coercion, threats, indoctrination, peer, or family pressure. In the end, Satan has won. Even solitary rituals are done out of free will and devotion.

HAIL SATAN!! “Occult Crimes” This morning on CNN news, the anchorwoman reported that certain animal shelters no longer offer black cats for adoption two weeks before Halloween as several have been found dead after being used in \"Satanic\" sacrifices. This is few and far in-between and the media sensationalizes whatever they can. * There are many kids and teens out there looking for Satan. Due to the suppression of books, media, and literature that provide knowledge about true Satanism, people look to what is easily and readily available. Anton LaVey wrote about this in his last book “Satan Speaks.\" He complained justifiably that he was given little or no airtime in contrast to xians who were given prime slots and endless time to spew forth their lies. As a result, some people, especially the naive youth, turn to and believe what they see and are able to purchase. The misinformation about Satanism authored by fools who have no real knowledge or information is prolific and deliberately promoted by the enemy. These xian, new age and out to make a fast buck writers are the ones DIRECTLY responsible for the occult crimes and should be the ones who are brought to justice for lies, negligence and slander against our religion and corruption of the youth. Those of us who are close to Satan know how ludicrous these acts are. They have nothing whatsoever to do with true Satanism.

For far too long, xians and the enemies of Satan have been given free reign to speak for him and represent Satanism according to their own warped, distorted, sick, perverted standards, and have profited well in doing this. Many books in the new age/occult sections of bookstores promoting lies and misinformation are cheap and readily available. A blatant example is \"The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Spells and Magic.\" For $9.95, this book goes into detail about \"Making a pact with the Devil\" and how this requires \"drinking the blood of murdered children,\" human sacrifice, mutilating and torturing animals and every other ugly thing. Unfortunately, books like this are all over the place and the scum who write and promote this sick garbage should be heavily cursed. This is where our religion has gotten a bad rap, FROM LIES! In every Catholic mass, the priest says \"eat my body; drink my blood\" This is where this kind of misinformation originates. The enemy takes hold of those who are lacking in knowledge and of course, Satan is blamed. We must put a stop to this. *Animals and children are sacred to Satan. People who abuse animals and children are an abomination to him. Cats were sacred and held in very high esteem in Ancient Egypt and many Demons are symbolized by appear in the form of a cat.

You are minding your own business, not bothering a soul; maybe you are even feeling very happy. All of a sudden, regardless of all the blatantly visible \"No Soliciting\" signs, the \"Do not Disturb\" signs, or anything else posted to deter unwanted visitors, there is an urgent knock at the door, or the doorbell is ringing like there is a serious emergency, interrupting you, disturbing you without any respect for your privacy or any consideration as to what else you may be tending to or engaged in, in your own place of residence, whatsoever. Door to door, peddling the Nazarene. You are sleeping, resting, AGAIN, minding your own business. Maybe you are even expecting an important phone call. The phone is ringing and ringing.

The absolute WORST of this is what they do to our children. They stalk them and prey upon them, corrupting their innocence and instilling hang-ups and psychological problems where there were none before. They use all kinds of scare tactics to frighten them with their lies. They work to turn them against their non-xian parents and destroy their lives, coercing them towards living for their death and throwing their lives away. The schools are full of them. Freedom fighters and the government are constantly battling the xian church that is forever a continuous threat to the lives and liberties of others. Once children are ensnared, they are abused, raped, molested and psychologically destroyed, and in some cases, even mutilated and murdered. In the least, they will never live up to or acknowledge their full potential. Xians are forever trying to wrest control of the legal system, perverting it, like they do everything else, using it as another instrument to deny ALL of us our freedom, to enslave everyone, destroy lives and ruin what others have sacrificed everything for. When they seize control, through whatever means, legal, illegal; however, makes no difference to them, they work diligently to maim, torture, murder and destroy anyone who is even suspected of disagreeing with their sick doctrines. Their reign was during the \"Dark Ages\" To find out if something is good or evil, all one has to do is give it power. Here, the xian religion speaks for itself! They continuously PUSH themselves where they are not wanted. They are compulsive and obsessive. They are not a joke and will not just go away or mind their own business. They would gladly resume their murderous ways if only given the opportunity. Anything that has helped humanity- medicine, communication, literacy, modern conveniences, sciences that help us understand the world around us, anything that gives life more meaning or makes it pleasurable, they have worked overtime to slander and destroy. Yet, they make full use of everything they have contributed NOTHING to, working every step of they way to destroy. They make use of modern conveniences to spread their malignant virus around the world. There IS NO room for tolerance here. This is total fucking WAR!

People rationalize, make excuses, focus on the small percentage of xians that are polite and mind their own business. This is what keeps them going. There are many who lack the education concerning world history, the INQUISITION, and the church's control of life and government in the dark/middle ages. These people know next to nothing of the truth. They believe what they are told and are too unmotivated or lazy to research for themselves. Knowledge is everything; this is why xians prey on the ignorant and illiterate. 309"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Past Life Amnesia; How it Affects This Life Many things are fated with one’s being in the wrong place at the wrong time, with the wrong people, again at the wrong time, accidents, illnesses, missing something by a day or minute. All of this is the result of a lack of knowledge. Reincarnation is a fact. When we enter a new life we bring ourselves with us. This includes past hang-ups and former conditioning, mistaken beliefs, grief, pain and so forth. When we enter a new existence, we do so under amnesia. There is information available concerning certain experiments. Many of these have been kept from the public because of their cruel nature, studying the effects of artificially induced amnesia on both animal and human subjects and how it directly affects the feedback circuit in the brain. With self-awareness, one can exercise control, but on the other hand, when the feedback circuit is blocked through amnesia, one is prevented from reforming problem programming in one's mind. Russian psychologist, Ivan Pavlov conducted a series of experiments on dogs. Most of us are familiar with the theory of conditioning, taught in Psychology 1001. Dogs were given food after a bell was rung. The bell, after several times, caused the dog to salivate (anticipate food), whether or not the food followed. The sound produced hunger in the dog. Two separate stimuli, applied within seconds of each other will create an involuntary response in the brain. Many of his experiments went beyond the conditioning. He was able to produce nervous breakdowns in dogs and other animals, again, by association. The hungry animal would go for the food and he would apply painful shocks, extremely loud noises, blasts of scorching heat or other stimuli creating a survival verses fear/pain situation. This created neurosis and mental illness in the animals, in the same way the xian church has ruined the mental health of billions by enforcing the abstinence of sexual intercourse and denying other normal and natural needs. Sexuality is equal to the life force; abstinence creates neuroticism. The enemy gods know all about the human mind and how to destroy it. Another Russian scientist, A R Luria continued Pavlov's experiments, but this time on humans. (The CIA does this as well, although much has been kept from the public). Luria found that humans, being able to remember, were able to resist the programming and restore their minds through rational thought and the application of will. Luria, (along with the CIA in later years) induced amnesia in his subjects through electric shock treatments, and drug induced trance states where 99.9% of humanity can be hypnotized and reprogrammed. Electric Shock treatment (EST) has been used to treat and control mental illness. EST causes retrograde amnesia. Memories are destroyed, corresponding with the intensity and frequency of the shocks. With high level EST, one is unable to remember one's name, identity or past. The subject becomes extremely clam and focused in the present. The 1975 movie, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is a good example of the effects of EST especially in the ending where the character, portrayed by Jack Nicholson, was shocked into irreversible brain damage with no memory of his identity or past. Disturbing thoughts and false memories can be implanted in subjects' minds by the operator's regressing the subjects into early childhood or infancy. At this stage, the mind becomes defenseless and helpless. The operator is perceived as and assumes the role of a parent figure. A prime example of this was where false memories were implanted by an xian psychiatrist in the subject of the book \"Michelle Remembers.\" Inducing neuroticism usually, though not always, requires the operator to regress the subject and implant false memories, such as the rape of the child by a parent. One hundred percent of the time, amnesia must be suggested to the subject so the subject will have no recall of the session or implanted suggestions. Reprehensible false memories, fears, and all kinds of psychological problems can be 310"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"implanted by suggestion in the subject’s mind such as the murdering a loved one, irrational fears, shame, and guilt. Amnesia prevents the subject from understanding the hang-ups and dealing with them. The subconscious mind retains them and acts on them. The subject is unaware of them, other than having strange, irrational feelings, unexplained neuroses, and abnormal behavior. Regardless, the problems are still there and affect the subject's future behavior. This is what happens when we experience amnesia concerning past lives. We have more experiences than we know hanging around in our subconscious minds and affecting us in this lifetime. We don't understand why bad things happen and we are powerless in many cases to prevent or stop them. The movie, Hannibal, is an example of what can be done to someone in a drug induced trance state, where psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter offered Mason Verger a popper (amyl nitrate), and suggested to him to peel off his face. In this fictitious case, there was no amnesia. We can begin to really know ourselves and take better control of our lives, by accessing past lives through self-hypnosis, learning, and understanding as much about them as we are able to. We all should take the time to enter our own trance states and explore our own minds, childhood memories, and past lives. Because of the curse of amnesia and the lack of knowledge, there is so-called \"karma.\" Karma can only be overcome and defeated with knowledge. Knowledge is the key to everything. Knowing everything about ourselves, past lives and so forth will set us free. Satanic Healing An author wrote about his interactions with angels. He asked them for help in healing himself. The angels gave him no knowledge or information other than telling him his problem was \"emotional.\" The truth is, most physical ailments are not emotional, but nutritional. Satan himself told me what to take for a couple of problems I was having. The problems are now totally under control. Satan and his Demons are very open and helpful when it comes to giving us information and knowledge. I do have another problem he wants me to heal on my own; he told me how and my Demon gave me some good advice. Most people who go to angels come out with nothing but self-deprecation and blame. The angel usually tells the sorry individual they are in some way responsible for their situation and they need to be more \"loving\" or that they \"shouldn't have any hatred or anger.\" Denial of one's feelings is definitely not good for emotional, physical, or mental health. By repressing our so-called baser emotions, we actually set ourselves up illnesses. Another token of angels is the refusal to share any worthwhile information. Thanks to Father Satan, two major problems I had are now gone. What he told me, I could have never known myself. HAIL SATAN!! ABOUT HOLES IN THE AURA By practicing power meditation every day, you will strengthen your aura and this will in turn give you the needed power to manifest your directed thoughts and desires into reality. A powerful aura will also result in a strong immunity and the healing of various physical problems. True Satanism is about becoming, growing and evolving. In the beginning, Satan and his Demons give us a hand up. The goal of Satanism is for us to empower ourselves. This is analogous to a child 311"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"growing up and becoming independent of his/her parents and having the strength, knowledge and confidence to act on his/her own as a healthy and well balanced adult. Ideally, one should become strong, confident, independent, and take control of his/her own life, fate, and direction. The enemy wants to keep us ignorant and bound. A good example is an author exalted and praised the work of angels who would come into him and help to heal his clients who were suffering from illnesses and injuries. He bragged how both he and the client would feel the hands of the angel and \"their wonderful healing ability\" going to work on problem areas. First of all, what is this *really* doing? It is making a dependent cripple of BOTH the client and the practitioner. No knowledge is given. No higher level of personal power is reached to do this alone, by one's self. IT IS IN REALITY, DAMNING THEM BOTH TO AN EXISTENCE OF DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNAL ENTITIES; BEING AT THE MERCY AND WHIMS OF SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THE BOTH OF THEM, CALLING ALL OF THE SHOTS AND TAKING THEIR ENERGIES IN THE FORM OF PRAISES FOR SOMETHING EACH ONE COULD DO ALONE GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE AND APPLICATION THEREOF. The nazarene was famous for this. Society and everything else collapsed as a result. The reason I have been focusing on the power meditations so much is they are necessary in building one's energy field and psychic abilities. Without the power behind the directed energy, nothing will manifest. Many problems are due to holes and leaks in the field of the aura. These can be brought upon by childhood trauma either physical or emotional where one was victimized in some way, or even as an adult; from surgery or accidents. Holes in the aura can open the door to unwanted entities, illnesses, and health problems. The hieroglyphics and carvings in many of the Egyptian temples and pyramids are there to tell us something. The classic pose with the arms crossed over the chest is for a reason- to protect the heart chakra. The heart chakra is where humans are most vulnerable, EMOTIONALLY. Human beings thrive on love and acceptance. An infant deprived of love, often will not thrive and if they do, most will be impaired for life, mentally, emotionally, and even physically. Love is an essential part of our makeup. Entities who wish to destroy us, know this. The deluded New Age movement's focus on \"unconditional love\" (there is no such thing in reality, regardless of how they rationalize and lie to themselves), is VERY dangerous and opens those who take this advice, making them ready victims for all kinds of entities. This is the scheme of the Nazarene parasite that is nearly always depicted with open arms, exposing the heart chakra, encouraging victimization. Love comes from the heart chakra. Psychic vampirism in most cases feeds off emotions. The heart chakra is exploited. Sometimes there are certain family members who are abusive and others who we know are bad for us, yet we allow them to abuse us or manipulate us because of an uncontrollable emotional vulnerability we have towards them. One is open and vulnerable and allows them in. They attach, connect, and control. We have opened our hearts to them in some way. The Nazarene and other unwanted entities gain entry the same way. A small child taken to church and Sunday school is continually coerced into \"loving Jesus.\" We are told, \"God is love.\" The same lies about the Nazarene. This opens up the MOST vulnerable part of a human being so that he/she can be controlled by these unwanted and harmful entities. The love energy is exploited and used by these entities as a parasite uses its host to its demise and sucks it dry. As you all can see, these entities gain control of and work through many of the new age people. 312"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"A weak aura with holes leaves one vulnerable to all kinds of things. Remember, negative entities feed on FEAR and other human emotions. This is another reason for the xian doctrines maximize the emotion of fear indoctrinating their followers with threats of eternal \"hellfire\" and damnation. This makes it much easier for these parasites to attach unknowingly to these people's auras and use their energy. All of this becomes a vicious cycle. To seal holes in the aura, one must first have a strong energy field. Most often, after becoming competent with power meditation, one can sense where the holes are located. By repeatedly directing the energy to the holes and expanding the aura in and around the areas of the holes, in time they will seal. The Brotherhood of the Snake Teachings of Ancient Egypt The pyramids served many purposes. One purpose was that of initiation and ceremonial rites, both for humans and for the magickal workings of the Gods. Many hieroglyphics depict the Gods tuning their chakras with a rod-like instrument. Satan gave these energy centers to humanity, they are known as the breath of life, breathed into us by God (Father Satan). There are seven primary chakras and many minor ones. The hook and the flail were tuning tools for the primary chakras along the spine. A mural on a wall at Abu Simbel depicts Horus holding a rod to the back of Osiris' head, at the point that is the primary doorway to the eighth chakra (above the crown of the head). The hook is moved up and down the rod to tune the chakra. Osiris is standing with an erection. Sexual energy is a paramount component in the rite of resurrection and immortality. Kundalini is sexual; the life force. Sexual energy is that of the life force, as it has the power to create life through another human being. The sexual energy runs up and down the spine during the tuning process. The Egyptian Ankh symbolizes eternal life and eternal life is linked to the breath. The Ankh is also linked to sexual energy. One of the key teachings was the overcoming of fear. Only when one surpasses all personal fears, can higher levels be accessed. Fear is the main emotion that prevents one from advancing spiritually. Fears must first be overcome here on Earth. To reach this goal, the Egyptians built special temples along the Nile. There are 12, along with the great pyramid making 13. 1+3=4. All of the verses in the xian bible referring to Satan and his Demons given certain mathematical applications, come out as 13. Four was Satan's original number. The Temple at Kom Ombo represents the second chakra, and is dedicated to polarity/duality; the basis of sexuality and two Gods are associated with it- Sobek, the Crocodile God and Horus. The Ancient Egyptians would create experiences in these temples that would push initiates past their fears to become strong and competent in experiencing the unknown. There was a water hole full of crocodiles. The initiate, taking only one breath would dive under water not knowing what to expect and the test was to emerge from the water in a different location from where he/she went in. Initiates were unaware that the crocodiles were fully fed. They had to remain calm and in control to navigate the water. ¹ The sarcophagus in the King's chamber was used for the adepts as one of their final tests. The pyramids were built precisely along powerful earth energy lines known as “ley lines” and used by the Gods in their ritual workings. Beneath the great pyramid are the Halls of Amenti, the womb of the Earth. The adept would lie in the sarcophagus in the correct position so a powerful beam would hit the third eye chakra. The adept would then begin a specific type of meditation and the experience would be so blissful, some never returned. Part of the initiation was the conditioning of the student to remember to return to their bodies after the experience. The final initiation also was held in the King's chamber. This 313"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"4-5 minute ceremony took place in the center of the room.

Supporting References: The Illustrated Egyptian Book of the Dead : a new translation with commentary by Ramses Seleem, 2001 Christian Mind Control Methods One technique xians have used for centuries is that of mind control. Those who attend xian services or masses subject themselves to being programmed. One naturally becomes bored and begins mindlessly daydreaming, or even half-nodding off to sleep. This is when one is most susceptible to their subconscious mind being programmed. This is even worse for in the case of small children and even babies whose minds are open and susceptible. In colonial times, church masses lasted all day long. The church usher would carry a long steel pole with a ball at the tip to crack those who nodded off on the head. Church attendance was compulsory, resulting in fines or public humiliation such as confinement to the stocks for a specified period of time if one did not comply. All of this is a conspiracy. The xian church masses and services are meant to be boring in order to induce a passive and receptive state of mind where one can be programmed without their knowledge. Those who control the xian program know all about the mind and how to program the populace. They are nothing but a bunch of the worst criminals. All of this is done deliberately to create a slave state. The slave state is the goal of xianity. The xians who walk around with the pasty artificial smiles as though in a trance are those who continuously subject themselves to this indoctrination. More and more church attendance and reinforcement turns them into conditioned robots. This is one reason many who are in the process of breaking away from xianity have a hard time, experience confusion and sometimes fear. People are unaware they are actually being hypnotized. Studying the truth will eventually result in deprogramming one's mind. The fear, doubt, and confusion will eventually give way to reason. Xian “Prayer” I'm sure most of you have heard the latest news concerning the recovery of Elizabeth Smart of Utah, who was abducted several months ago. The xian family raved on and on about \"The Lord,\" and quoted bible scriptures in front of the press, following her return. 314"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The point is- there were many, many xians praying for the girl non-stop for these past months. Even the worst of idiots, who for months keep applying \"prayer\" which amounts to psychic energy, as part of a group who is doing the same, will achieve something. Then they go on to praise the \"Lord.\" They don't realize all along, it was their own efforts. When we go to Satan, we go one on one and he hears us. We don't need multitudes of people and psychic energy to receive help in our time of need or to receive answers, nor do we have to wait months and months; even years or in many cases, never; to be acknowledged. The above is obvious. It took several months of \"prayer\" (applied psychic energy) for these people to achieve their ends. In most cases, xian prayers are futile and it stands to reason when there are groups of people applying the energy of their minds to a specific goal, there can be success. Fools are taken in by this sort of thing. Familiars A familiar is an animal that is a gift from Satan to one of his disciples. This animal forms an extremely tight and loving bond with the owner. The animal is different from other animals in that he/she is inhabited by a Demon. The bond is usually so close, should the owner fall sick, the animal often will feel ill as well. Dogs, cats, birds, rodents, and reptiles can be familiars. A witch can have several familiars. One will find they are looked after and protected by helpful Demons who will see to their well-being. These animals are gifts from Father and should be treated very well. Witches were said to take great care of their familiars. Familiars are highly protective. They can help in magick as a partner. Witches who do not have familiars can send out a psychic call to attract the right animal. Familiars are known to be sensitive to psychic power and are welcome partners for the raising of power, the casting of spells, scrying, spirit contact, and other magickal work. They also serve as psychic radar, visibly reacting to the presence of any unwelcome or negative energy. The pet dog of a High Priest viciously growled and snarled, with his hair bristled when the presence of an angel was detected and warned his owner of this unwanted presence. The protection goes both ways. The owner will also be psychically protective towards his/her familiar. The bond here is a strong as parent to child. In contrast to all of the enemy claims and horror stories, Satan holds animals in high regard and wishes for his people to treat them with much respect. In the Al Jilwah, he states, \"The beasts of the earth, the birds of heaven, and the fish of the sea are all under the control of my hands.\" One of the reasons for the rampant spread of the bubonic plague (Black Death) in Europe during the 14th century was the xian church declared cats to be of the Devil and people killed them en masse. This left the rat population to explode at an alarming rate and the fleas that were common to rats spread the plague. 315"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Important Points I received a personal e-mail today that brought up several important issues that I feel need to be addressed to everyone. Due to compulsory xianity in many homes in the USA, Europe, and in many other countries worldwide, most of us come from xian backgrounds. Remember, once you make a commitment to Satan, you enter a new life. The past is dead. Don't dwell on your former experiences with past teachings and religions. Forget them. Satan accepts you; he understands. Some people feel because they come from an xian, even fundie background, or were involved in activities where they blasphemed Satan, he is angry with them. The most important point here is with Satan, we realize our past error and come to him of our own free will, free from coercion. We renounce our past, the enemy god and everything connected with him. We renew our lives through Satan. The past is dead- PERIOD. Another point is often, people expect drastic changes immediately following a commitment ritual. This does not usually happen. When I did mine several years back, I didn't know what to expect. I expected nothing. I had little to go on and no support or direction whatsoever. I found within two months, Father Satan blessed me with something nice that I did not expect. Be patient. We are all individuals and he rewards us in different ways. Most of these will be subtle to begin with, but over time, you will see where your life has really improved. Those who have no expectations and just go on about their lives will find themselves pleasantly surprised. All of us get sick or experience problems at times. Everyone has his/her Saturn so to speak. Father Satan looks out for us and gives us the strength and his support to make it through rough times. The longer you are with Satan, the stronger you will become. I would also like to comment on impatience. Many, especially teens are very hard on themselves and too self-critical. Becoming an adept does not happen overnight, nor does it happen in a few months. Improvement can be seen when one works on this, but with working a Ouija Board, divining the future or spirit communication, this takes time. It has taken me over 25 years to master astrology and some other disciplines, although I was an atheist for many years and less than committed. Be patient with yourself. In closing, the planets are really bad concerning world affairs. I strongly encourage everyone to empower yourselves NOW, DO NOT WAIT! Your aura will protect you. Remember, we are NOT those who are without. Don't put this off or wait. Do the Awakening exercises and empower your aura/chakras. This builds when done every day and can save your ass where others fall into lethal circumstances. It is against my purpose here to go into any politics, but I will tell you, the transiting planets and the messages those of us who are very close to Satan have been getting are indeed ominous. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich Patience When people are new to Satanism, one of the first things many want to know is who their Personal/Guardian Demon/ess is. This is a good thing, but I recommend people get to know Satan first.

I have learned the most directly from Father Satan and my Demons. I have even had Demons enter into me and help me out with a psychic reading for fun. The bond we have with our Demon/ess is one of the strongest we will ever know, it just takes time.

There is no way Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly had any knowledge of this in the 16th century. The \"Vision of the Round House\" is identical: Humanity was created by extra-terrestrials who needed slave laborers in the mines. By taking the ovum from a Cro-Magnon/primate and using artificial insemination with a sperm from one of the Nephilim, we were created. The one known as Satan created us and designed us. He intended to bring us knowledge and make us as the Gods, but he was prevented from doing so and cursed by some of the other Gods. We did not evolve naturally, as did animals who have overall better health and immunity. Satan wished to bring us to perfection, but some of the other Gods wanted for us to be destroyed after the mission was over, and since we were becoming an issue, they attempted to let us all drown in the flood. During early development an embryo enters a stage. This stage under a microscope looks just like an APPLE. This is known as the \"Torus Stage.\" The shape is called a \"Morula.\" Every single form of life goes through this stage. This is the \"apple\" that was written about in the Garden of Eden. This is where Satan went against the other Gods and gave us more advanced genetics. The \"breath of God\" is the soul. The chakras are the psychic energy centers that are activated by BREATHING in certain ways to enable the Kundalini to ascend. When the Kundalini Serpent ascends, enlightenment/Godhead is achieved. The Tree of Life is Ancient Egyptian in origin. It is actually a pattern of the human soul. It plugs into the Flower of Life that has been inscribed upon so many walls in Egyptian temples and also in the pyramids. The Flower of Life is the blueprint for every living thing. 317"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Fools claim Satan is a \"Christian invention.\" All of the Old Gods were made into Devils and Demons in order to destroy their relations with humans. These Gods have been present throughout the history of the human race and have attempted to give us knowledge and to help us in our times of need. Cities were destroyed, libraries and other places where books were kept were burnt and destroyed. Every culture, such as the Philistines, that worshiped other Gods was made war upon and genocide of the populace soon followed. The Philistines worshiped Beelzebub, he was the God of the Philistine city of Ekron and Zebulon. (Baal [Lord] Zebulon). There are few if any traces of the truth left concerning these Gods. To replace the knowledge that was destroyed, the Christian Church invented a fictitious past and history of religion. The Old Gods have remained as Devils and Demons just to survive. The Judeo/Christian \"God\" wishes for the destruction of humanity. This can be seen in the Inquisition, and the anti-life teachings, especially where the abstinence of sexual intercourse is concerned, to stop us from procreating and the plethora of crimes against humanity. Moses went on a rampage of war and slaughter when he descended from the mount under the direction of Jehova and the incident at Fatima where the virgin bitch revealed the alien contempt for humanity in the hopeful anticipation of our blowing ourselves to bits with nuclear weapons, are just two of thousands of examples. With the opening of the watchtowers a small increment (Aleister Crowley 1904), humanity has been flooded with knowledge in the last 100 years that has been unparalleled in the whole of history. We have not had time to adapt. This was the sole intention of the angels who communicated the information to Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly. That the knowledge would act to destroy humanity within a short period of time. One hundred years is nothing to the Gods. With the coming of the enemy \"God\" Jehova, humanity was oppressed with an artificial mode of time that is contrary to how the universe runs. With this artificial time, the enemy has programmed fated events to occur that are detrimental to humanity. The fact that they were angels is portrayed by their arrogance and condescending attitude towards the two men. Demons are very friendly and understanding when treated with respect. I have never known Demons to be arrogant. Most people either study physical science or the occult knowledge. Not very many study both. This is where people would benefit, by studying both, for in the end, it all comes together.

In order to really know truth, you must become acquainted with both sides without prejudice. The Christian Churches have worked overtime to keep humanity horrified of and as far from the one known as “The Devil” for centuries. The truth is because they have plenty to hide and this involves where your soul will be going. The truth is these Churches have been abusing occult power for centuries and this is the foundation of their power and their wealth. Your spiritual ignorance depends upon it. Due to centuries of systematically destroying knowledge, the Christian Churches have been at liberty to dictate what Satan and Satanism are all about. The movie, \"The Possession of Emily Rose\" is another scare tactic by the Catholic Church and the alleged true story behind it is a horrific example of Christian Ritual Abuse, which is alarmingly prevalent, but like the recent exposé of the pedophilia scandals, these have been suppressed by the media, given the wealth, power, and control of the Christian Churches. Victims of choice are children and young people. It is claimed the victimized girl’s knees ruptured “due to the 600 genuflections she performed obsessively during the daily exorcism.” The Catholic “genuflection” was stolen from the Ancient Egyptians. This can be seen in the hieroglyphics and the truth be known, everything in the Christian religion has been stolen and corrupted from religions predating it by hundreds to thousands of years from all over the world. I am a High Priestess of Satan and I am very close to the one known as \"Satan.\" I know Satan and his Demons as real beings. I also happen to know Satan is our True Creator God and I can prove it if one takes the time to read along and study the material provided by links at the bottom of this article. Allegations of \"possession\" are always directed at Satan. Upon closer examination and evidence from those of us who are close to Satan and have been Satanists for many years, we can state with confidence the one the Christian Churches call \"The Devil\" has nothing to do with “possession” whatsoever. As a matter of fact, if one would think with a clear head and apply some logic, it becomes very evident who is really behind it all. In addition, that movie was chock full of subliminal messages to frighten people. Let us examine some key points of the movie: The reason for the possession in the movie, was for \"God\" to let humanity \"know we have a spiritual side.\" Ok, now what kind of way is this to let anyone know they have a spiritual side?? Everything in the Christian religion smacks of negativity: fear, terror, physical mutilation, ignorance, unknowing, cannibalism (Jesus is the living blood sacrifice) and the petrified human is left helpless, unknowing, and told he/she \"must suffer.\" I would also like to add upon studying the planetary positions (I am a professional astrologer) in this now deceased young woman's date of birth, she was at extremely high risk for mental illness and irrational fears with a very pronounced Neptune; Saturn/Neptune conjunction, exact Venus/Neptune conjunction and other astrological factors that contributed. Anneliese Michel was not a stable personality and given her life-long intense indoctrination with Catholicism, it is not surprising these problems came to the surface. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Spiritual Satanism, Satan shows us we have a spiritual side through power meditation and knowledge in a positive sense. This is true spirituality. The spiritualism in Christianity is false. Christianity, namely the Catholic Church has been a tool to remove all spiritual 319"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"knowledge from the populace and replace it with practices and legends that have been stolen, twisted, and defiled from other religions around the world that existed from hundreds to thousands of years preceding it. This is a fact and with enough research it has been proven. The goal is and always has been to keep spiritual knowledge in the hands of a few who run the world think they are God. (See reference links at the bottom of this article). Those of us who are close to Satan and refuse to worship the false gods of the Koran and the Bible fear nothing. We also have the spiritual knowledge and the spiritual authority to deal with psychic attacks and to understand where they are coming from. Satan who is the True Creator of humanity, gives us the power, self-confidence, and the strength to be resistant against such things. Those aliens who represent the false “God” idly stand by and sadistically watch the utter horror and torment of their hated ones- innocent human beings. These entities cannot hide their true character from those of us who can see. Everything they are and do is ugly and negative. The “Virgin Mary” appeared to the girl in the movie and sadistically encouraged her to suffer. Now, logically, think for a minute about this so-called \"possession.\" What is the objective of so-called \"Demonic possession\"? What does this accomplish? What would this sort of thing accomplish for Satan and his Demons? This sort of thing has left people so frightened of Satan; few have ever been able to know him without prejudice. On the other hand, it is plainly clear what this does for the Christian Church. This sort of thing spreads terror and that terror is based upon the spiritual ignorance and helplessness of the majority of humanity. The Catholic Church mass murdered, and tortured to death millions of innocent human beings who had spiritual knowledge, burned and completely destroyed hundreds of libraries where spiritual knowledge was kept. Some of this is hoarded in the Vatican Library of which certain sections are only open to the top clergy. 1. Lukewarm Christians and others who do not regularly practice are frightened into returning to church on a regular basis and this gives the churches more material wealth and power and above all, the psychic energy they need to channel into their goals of enslaving the world. 2. Spiritual power is kept in the hands of a few to the detriment of all. The Jesuits who run the Vatican, unbeknownst to the average Christian are fully capable of spiritually harming another human being, especially their own devout Catholics who tie into the beliefs (sympathetic magick). This order is adept when it comes to black magick and the average person is helpless against it. This is shown through all of the wealth and power they have. Protestants enjoy pointing the finger at the Catholic Church, yet they refuse to look at their own who are every bit as guilty and tie into the same lies in the bible (a book comprised of corrupted material stolen from religions around the world predating it), and upon close examination is a hoax infused with occult power with a very sinister objective for those who believe in it. This is a classic case of sympathetic magick where a connection must be made at some level. The connection to the original religions is in everyone's racial memory. Satan, who is our True Creator God does not contradict himself. 3. They forever rant and rave how “The Devil deceives and is the ‘Master of Lies’” yet for any scam to be successful, the victim(s) must be unknowing on some level. Spiritual knowledge comes from Satan. Christian Priests and ministers alike are lost as to giving answers and solutions to many problems that face humanity. In contrast, Spiritual Satanists have the ability to heal themselves and loved ones, astral project their souls at will (this enables one to navigate the astral and be familiar with it so upon death, he/she will neither be lost nor spiritually helpless), obtain the necessities and comforts of life through power meditation, to spot spiritual problems and to heal them in him/herself and others. Satan has given us knowledge of the anatomy of the soul and how to maintain the soul and keep it healthy so 320"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"problems like the above never happen. 4. These are gifts from Satan who is our true God and Creator. There is nothing spiritual about the Christian churches. Christians are under a powerful spell of catastrophic proportions and those who do not wake up will face their own damnation through a lack of knowledge. It is sad they picked upon Belial and accused him of such things in that film. Belial has done much to help those who are under his protection and guidance to advance spiritually. Belial would never allow a disciple of his to suffer needlessly and when a dedicated Satanist is in trouble spiritually (yes, we get attacked by the same angels who are behind these possessions that are blamed upon Demons) other Demons and at times even Satan himself will come to the aid of the victimized human and see to it no harm comes to him/her. In closing, the Demons were bound for centuries. Anneliese Michel (the real name of “Emily Rose” was supposedly “possessed” in 1968. I can reassure you the Demons including Belial were bound and it was not until very recently were they released. I know because I was involved in releasing them. Only now are they able to come forward and defend themselves and reveal the truth to those who will listen. It is said “In the end, the truth will come out and many will want to join on at the last minute, but it will be too late.” Read on and learn the truth before it is too late... - High Priestess Maxine Dietrich The Truth About Biblical Prophesies I have received a several e-mails, one from a Christian preacher and a few others who lacked knowledge; mostly from Christians who use the predictions in the biblical book of Revelation/Apocalypse as an excuse to adhere to Christianity (Again fear is used ad nauseum). I posted an article some time ago in regards to the Jehova’s Witnesses and how for the past 150+ years, they have been predicting “Armageddon” to occur either within the coming year or within the next five or ten years. When they are proven wrong, of course they blame it all on “the Devil” and make other stupid excuses. It really gets to be a pathetic joke. In truth, we are in the last days of the Age of Pisces and there will be drastic changes. Exactly what these changes will be remains open. The Age of Aquarius will not be upon us though, until the middle of the next century. Now, concerning these prophesies. There have always been earthquakes, famine, pestilences and such. Only in the past century, have sciences such as geology, chemistry and physics advanced to where determinations of the magnitude and epicenter of earthquakes, the intensity of tornadoes and calculations of other natural disasters can be made. With the capabilities of mass media, it is now possible for these occurrences to be reported worldwide within minutes. 1,000 years ago, a massive earthquake would have only been recorded locally, and would not have been reported around the entire world, as there was no media to report it. Obviously, TV’s, newspapers, and radios did not exist in those times. There are many arguments concerning the supposed “end.” Now, Satan tells us in the Al Jilwah that the Judeo/Christian Bible was the product of input from the “other gods.” This can be easily seen as the entire book is made up of myths, legends and characters stolen from other religions around the world that pre-dated Judaism and Christianity by hundreds to thousands of years. 321"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Most of these prophesies were written for one reason and one reason only- to create fear in an unknowing humanity, and through that fear, enslave and enforce the obedience of human beings. Biblical prophesies are not based upon clairvoyance on the part of these gods, but upon information. Humanity has been stripped of ancient knowledge due to centuries of Christian control and remains ignorant, falling victim to believing these threatening forecasts. Let me explain. Yes, there have been signs in the sky, such as the grand sextile, which has never been seen before in all of recorded history. The grand sextile is a six-pointed star. Its origin is the Hindu “Star of Vishnu.” The Hebrew \"Star of David\" was stolen from this. The Star of Vishnu predates the \"Star of David\" by thousands of years. At any rate, when one has knowledge, one can make predictions that have a very high probability of occurring. This is no different from when a Medical Doctor makes a prognosis or when a meteorologist predicts a hurricane’s path because they can see it from satellite images, and where it is heading. Both examples are the result of having enough data, knowledge, and experience. The same can be said for the Gods. Beings who have a life span of thousands and even millions of years, some like Father Satan and his Demons who are immortal, obviously, have seen much, much more than any human being, given their life span and advanced technology, knowledge and intelligence. They have seen the planetary line-ups, and how the solar systems these have occurred in were affected for thousands of years. For example, a tight sixty-degree planetary line up (stellium) preceded the Bubonic Plague in the 14th century. This line-up occurred one year before the outbreak of the first major plague in 1348. This same type of line-up also occurred in 1982 and with this AIDS came on the scene Both have taken a multitude of lives. The Gods mapped out the Ley Lines when they lived on the Earth. This was done in order to accurately predict the magnitude and location of future earthquakes and other natural disasters. The Gods were much more advanced than our present day seismologists are. The information from the Earth grid also provided enough knowledge for accurate prediction of the shifting of the poles and other potentially catastrophic events. These predictions were not based upon clairvoyance, but upon knowledge and ultra-advanced technology. Christopher Columbus knew of an impending Lunar Eclipse and the date the eclipse would occur. He was taken prisoner by natives on a Caribbean island and obtained his release by stating that he could make the moon disappear. This frightened the natives knew nothing about eclipses and when they witnessed the disappearance of the moon, they immediately let him go. Remember a lack of knowledge= fear!! Fear= compliance, obedience and eventual enslavement. An insect who lives only 2-3 months during the summer season will never know winter, but winter occurs anyway. We know this from experience as we have lived through many, many winters. A lot can be done to manipulate the ignorant. Take the truth and mix it up with lies and you will have them believing the lies as well. This is what the enemy has done. So next time you are faced with some frightened and enslaved Christian who rants and raves about how the apocalyptic predictions are happening, be aware of how and why these were made. Remember, the Christian is taken in by these lies due to a lack of knowledge or just plain stupidity. With enough data and experience, accurate predictions are not hard to make. Add in the lies about Satan and they run to the Nazarene out of fear. 322"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"The All Many people who call themselves \"Satanists,\" and this particular point of view is very strong in the Church of Satan, believe they are already \"Gods.\" Some people even go as far as to claim that humanity is \"God.\" Well, \"God,\" then why is humanity in such a mess? Do you know your future, EXACTLY? What will happen tomorrow or a year from now? Can you accurately foretell the futures of your loved ones? Do you have the power ALONE to determine your own destiny? Can you heal yourself? Can you stop yourself from aging or from feeling pain? Can you move or levitate physical objects or yourself for that matter? Thanks to Father Satan, we all have within ourselves, the ability to achieve Godhead, but how many people REALLY know how? Extreme discipline and dedication every day are required. Unfortunately, humanity misses the boat in this matter. Most humans, thanks to xianity and other RHP religions are at square one. Few have enough REAL knowledge and power to determine their own destinies by themselves. Once a decision is made, or an action is taken, one has no real control over the outcome or result. We can often choose our actions, but not the results of those actions. We are also at the mercy of others actions and reactions, governments, acts of nature, our physical selves, and so forth. Most people have not empowered their third eye, crown chakra and other psychic centers to see and experience the astral realm and the beings that dwell therein. There is much we do not experience through our five senses that directly influences our lives and the world around us. As a professional Astrologer, psychic and Tarot card reader for over 25 years, I am VERY familiar with \"fate.\" An atheist walks a very lonely road; I did so for 15 years. Although I practiced mind training and attempted to influence matters by myself, the results were always less than what I had expected. Fate always intervened in one way or another. A friend of mine, who was also into the occult; we got to talking one day- \"well, why is it that things are hit and miss?\" No explanation, \"we don't know.\" He was an atheist also. Life was meaningless and unpredictable. Futility and depression were always on our tails so to speak. Oh, I fought back and hurt some of my enemies on sheer willpower and mind control alone, but this did nothing to improve my life, other than provide me with some pleasure in knowing that they got what they deserved. I don't know how many times, we hear the word \"force.\" There are many different \"forces.\" Light is a force, composed of tiny particles called photons. Then we have x-rays, gamma rays, infrared rays, and so on. An earthquake or volcano, or tornado, generates a tremendous amount of \"force.\" Then there is the \"life force,\" bioelectricity, this is also a \"force.\" These \"forces\" do not think, feel, have emotions, or make decisions by themselves. A \"force\" is impersonal. No \"force\" is a separate living being with reasoning, emotion, decision-making capabilities, nor does it act in various manners according to conscious choosing by itself. Any idiot with even a vestige of extra-sensory ability knows Satan and the Demons are not \"forces\" but real beings. Here I sit, dumbfounded again. Two Days ago, my eldest son came to me worried sick. He lost his job unjustifiably over two months ago (the manager who canned him is REALLY paying for this, Thank you, Father Satan!! He is thousands of dollars in debt and making only half of his former salary. It was early in the morning, after 7 am (we both work third shift). Needless to say, I was worried sick- utility shut offs, etc. I got down on my knees before the altar I made for Father Satan; I was still in my street clothes. I asked him to help and told him I trusted him to work it out in his own way. My son now has several thousand dollars cash in his hand, more than enough to pay all of the bills in full. All obtained 323"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"legally, no payback expected. The first religious book I read was the Satanic Bible. I did this out of extreme upset the xtians caused me. Where can I get away from these totally inconsiderate and harassing idiots?? I was still an atheist. One night on the internet, while visiting a Satanic website, I read- \"light a candle, sit and ask is Satanism for me?\" I was an atheist, I didn't light a candle, I just said it in my head. Things started to change all right. Over this time period, Satan has worked to establish a strong, trusting relationship with me. Satan is NOT \"just a force.\" He is a very compassionate, caring, loving and benevolent being with those who are dedicated to him. Satan has shown me love, He is the only one I have found I can totally trust. I have seen his miracles. He has calmed me when I was upset, comforted me. I have felt his beautiful love. I came home chilled one morning. This was nothing new. Going to sleep, normally I would warm up gradually. He put a warm aura all around me, head to toe as I was going to sleep and I felt his warmth and love. I have had so many experiences, too many to mention here. Satan is a literal being; he is NOT a \"force.\" There are very highly evolved beings in this universe, they are known to us as “Gods. Under the direction of Yaweh/Jehova, knowledge of the original Gods and the methods for humanity to achieve equality with the Gods was destroyed. Many ancient libraries, millions of scrolls, tablets and books were burned. The xian church has worked overtime at suppressing the truth, through intense indoctrination and through resorting to torture and mass murder when proselytizing and coercion failed. Humanity is nowhere near Godhead. These religions have prevented us from evolving in the area of mind ability and power. Most extra-terrestrials are highly adept and they have us over a barrel. Very few people have the ability to manipulate their environments using only the powers of their mind. The human race has a major disadvantage that renders us helpless against other beings and entities that are highly evolved and adept in the uses of their brains. These skills can only be achieved through guidance from Satan and his Demons who are the original Gods. We all have a long way to go. What really upsets me is how many of our own people treat our God, Satan. We have the strongest, most beautiful, loving, generous, and caring God there is. Xians create beautiful churches, cathedrals, sing beautiful hymns, Muslims bow down before \"Allah\" 5 times a day, Buddhists construct beautiful elaborate temples, worship and burn incense. What do these \"gods\" do? The xian \"god\" shits on all of his followers, as does Mr. \"Allah.\" Buddha does nothing. Here we have with Father Satan- many psychically incompetent people claim, \"Oh, he's just a force.\" We have very little praise and thanksgiving rituals of worship. It's always me, me, me! I want this! I want that! People receive things of which they ask from Satan and they never even stop to say thank you. They foolishly make demands and commands. These teachings come from the old judeo/xian authored grimiores that have been for centuries, advocating the abuse and extremely disrespectful treatment of Satan and his Demons. Some fools go as far to try to \"conjure\" Lucifer. Some ignorant next to nothing in importance, tries to summon him like a servant to fix a sorry love life. This extreme disrespect has gone on for centuries. Like the character in the movie, \"The Ninth Gate\" said- \"Orgies of aging flesh, conducted in the Master's Name.\" On a video tape of an Anton LaVey ritual, a woman rubs her genitals on a religious icon. Anyone who calls himself or herself a Satanist should be long past acting out sexual hang-ups. Save the orgies for afterwards. 324"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Satan appeared to a journalist in 1960 and stated that he did not like the way he was being worshipped. He went on to mention \"a lunatic in his basement with the shades down.\" He stated that he had already won the fight for the earth. There are things that need to change in the way people relate to him. He and the Demons have been subjected to such insulting and disrespectful treatment that has gone on for centuries. \"Oh, he's just a force.\" As for those people who believe they are already \"gods and do little or nothing to empower themselves,\" try doing your magick as a total atheist, by yourself. I find it so hypocritical how so-called \"Satanists\" who refuse to acknowledge Satan as a real being call upon him and his Crowned Princes of Hell in their rituals. The Truth About Satan's Power I don't know how many times I have heard Christian claims concerning the Nazarene or his angels banishing Satan from an area or \"casting out Demons.\" My own opinion regarding this is the \"Demons\" aren't really \"Demons\" but angels impersonating what Christians believe to be \"Demons.\" Why? Because it makes Satan appear to be under the control of the Nazarene and in many cases frightens those who lack knowledge. Fear is used to control. I was watching the movie \"The Exorcist.\" For those of you who are unfamiliar with this 1973 flick, the plot concerned a 12-year-old girl who was possessed by the Mesopotamian Demon \"Pazuzu.\" This movie topped the charts for years, designated as the ultimate in frightening the public. There have been few actual claims concerning cases of \"possession.\" Accounts included sketchy reports of victims \"vomiting objects\" and performing other senseless acts. Everyone knows souls are important to Satan; humanity is his creation. When we dedicate our souls to Satan, we become a part of a massive vortex of energy that we can tap into to accomplish our desires and objectives. The additional energy not only benefits humanity, but also benefits Father Satan and the Original Gods, and gives everyone concerned more power. (The Christian churches have exploited souls and their energy for centuries). Now, as we know souls are important to Satan, why would he or his Demons do anything to frighten people away, or make people try to avoid him at all costs? When looking at this analytically, one can see the truth, as there is a motive behind nearly everything. The only motive here is the greedy entity Jehova and ilk frightening ignorant human beings back into his energy bank of souls. Of course, Satan and his Demons are blamed as usual. Since Christians are forbidden to practice any magick or become knowledgeable in the occult, this ends with Jehova and ilk having a full supply of energy all to themselves to use as they see fit. For people who use the traditional methods of summoning spirits as instructed in the popular grimiores, which use the names of Jehova and his angels, how do they really know exactly who or what they are contacting? Everyone I ever heard from who went through Satan directly to summon a Demon respectfully has had positive experiences. I know I have. The followers of the Christian god and his foul Nazarene are forever crowing that this entity has power over Satan. In reality, this is not true. When I was new to Satanism, (this was before I performed the initiation rite), I experienced much confusion. I was very upset one night and COMMANDED the foul holy spirit of Jehova to leave my body forever IN THE NAME OF SATAN/LUCIFER. I felt a weak, battered energy leave me through my feet. Afterwards, I felt a deep sense of peace, and much of the confusion and turmoil I was 325"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"experiencing was gone. When I was twelve years old, Satan came to me in a Catholic Church, when an important Christian sacrament was being performed. The Christian \"God\" was powerless to stop him. On the other hand, I will bet one will never see Christian entities visit a Black Mass. A couple of years ago, I initiated a friend in a city park at 4 am, because as no privacy for a religious rite at home. Driving there, she was fearful and hesitant about dedicating her soul to Father Satan. When I was reading the prayers, afterwards, she told me, she saw a foggy white apparition that was an enemy spirit. Some Demons promptly appeared and chased it away. These Demons I might add were on the lower end of the Demonic hierarchy. They were the ones with the red eyes, gargoyle like with rubbery wings. This order of Demons mainly carry out tasks as messengers and protectors. I saw them quickly clear the path when Azazel approached the area they were in, out of respect. It didn't take much to get rid of the enemy spirit, afterwards, my friend felt much better. When Satan approached the Nazarene in the desert, HE DID NOT APPROACH HIM AS AN EQUAL, BUT AS A SUPERIOR. We do not worship an equal or a lesser being. Satan's offering to the Nazarene, right there, blatantly indicated that he had much more power than the Nazarene fool. He talked down to the Nazarene. Most Christians are fearful of Satan. Satanists can blaspheme foul Jehova, his worthless \"holy spirit,” and his pedophile son,* but few Christians will actively invite the wrath of Satan. Many are even fearful of us- so much for their faith in a cowardly impotent \"God.\" -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich *We believe the Nazarene to be a fictitious character, created from various myths and legends predating Christianity from hundreds to thousands of years. The sole purpose of this entity is to create a distraction. Unknowing followers are fooled into believing \"Jesus Saves\" when in truth, we save our own souls. Human beings have the power to heal and perform many other spiritual feats dubbed as \"miracles.\" The Nazarene has been used over the centuries to strip humanity of all spiritual power and knowledge. This has placed humanity as a whole at the mercy of advanced enemy beings to be viciously exploited and victimized. A weak soul not only experiences physical illness, but also is spiritually a pawn both in the hands of fate and in the hands of the enemy (The Christian entity and ilk). The Truth About so Called “Practices” Anyone who has studied Ancient Sumerian/Mesopotamian Mythology knows how distorted these legends became when they ended up as the foundation for the Judeo/Christian Bible. Much of the practices of the Knights Templar were also twisted into bizarre stories in order to convict and murder members of the Order on the grounds of heresy, along with so many others in their day. The Knights Templar originated in 1119 supposedly to “safeguard pilgrims” on their journeys to and from the Holy Land. There is a lot of controversy concerning this notion because there were only nine knights to begin with, and it has become known, they had specific instructions to dig beneath the Temple of Solomon. This became their primary center in Jerusalem on the site that is now occupied by \"The Dome of the Rock.\" Within a few decades following the excavation, the Templars grew into several thousand, and traveled extensively. Through this, they were initiated into various esoteric teachings, beliefs, and practices that survived outside of Europe and the control of the Christian Church. 326"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The Order grew from the founding number of nine to number in the thousands, and within a short period of time because of certain stipulations, they became very wealthy and influential, holding a large number of properties and banking houses both in Europe and abroad. What the original members discovered beneath Dome of the Rock is open to much speculation. Most scholars agree the Templars unearthed many ancient documents that revealed the Nazarene as a ficitious character. Other accounts and historical evidence point to the excavators further discovering that the Judeo/Christian \"God\" is the real \"Devil\" and that \"God\" and the \"Devil\" were reversed. Historically following this event, grimoires and so-called \"black books\" manifested in an illiterate Europe. From my extensive studies and research concerning the Knights Templars and the history of this period, I have come to the conclusion the excavators discovered documents containing instructions for spirit abuse. It is more than obvious the Catholic Church made ample use of these, exploiting Demons in erecting a plethora of ornate Gothic (Goetic) cathedrals and other structures that defy all rational explanation, given the widespread ignorance and illiteracy of the times. The order soon acquired extreme wealth. Many scholars attributed their advancement to their worship of the gilded Head of Baphomet. The idol was believed to have the power of creating wealth, causing trees to flourish and the earth to become fruitful. They were accused of anointing the head with \"the fat of murdered infants.\" THIS WAS NOT FAT FROM MURDERED INFANTS AS THE CHURCH PERVERTED, AND TWISTED THE INFORMATION. THIS \"FAT FROM 'MURDERED INFANTS'\" WAS SEMEN. In the Judeo/Christian Bible, when a man \"spills his seed,\" he is accused of murdering [potential] children (GEN 38: 9-10). Semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, blood, and other body fluids were traditionally used in ancient religious rites as standard procedure. These fluids contain the life force, and when used by knowledgeable practitioners or priests, energy can be directed and applied to accomplishing specific objectives in the material world. The Catholic Church's sole purpose was to remove any and all knowledge of the Ancient Gods, and religions that pre-dated Judeo/Christianity. A fictitious past was invented and to ensure this past would survive, anyone with knowledge of the truth was labeled as a \"heretic\" and condemned to torture and death. Accounts of ancient religious rites were perverted and warped by the Catholic Clergy to justify mass murder and to create an atmosphere of terror that is so necessary for control of the populace. The Christian Church twisted the ancient religious uses of body fluids into “murdering infants in the name of Satan.” This is false and has like so many other lies, evolved into taking on a life of its own, bringing accusations, murder, and slander upon Satanists and Pagans. Because most ancient knowledge was removed, warped and twisted, the church was at liberty to dictate what Satanism was all about to an unknowing populace. This sort of thing over the centuries has driven certain people who could no longer tolerate the sick anti-life religion of Christianity to apply the cultural concept of \"evil\" to Satan and engage in occult crimes, believing this to be of Satan. The church has made ample use of these accounts over the centuries to further their agenda of lies. The Knights Templar leaders did worship the Baphomet and renounce the Nazarene. In all probability from extensive travels in the Middle East, they more than likely learned the truth through interaction with the Yezidis and other peoples who kept the ancient ways. The magickal practices involving the regular use of body fluids and the use of semen in anointing the head, were acquired by the Templars from eastern sources of sex magick and tantric worship. Christianity had not yet infested these areas to remove the knowledge and replace it with lies. 327"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Another area these stories originated later on and grew into a life of their own was from some of the old grimoires. These writings would instruct the mage to \"sacrifice a kid.\" A \"kid\" is a young goat, NOT a human being! These grimoires are NOT of Satan. They are tools that were used to exploit the Original Gods who lost a battle in a war and had their powers taken from them. Warfare between advanced civilizations is spiritual and involves the soul. Charges against 231 knights ranged from blasphemy and Devil worship to sodomy and other so-called \"sins.\" Because of the wealth and power retained by the order, they had become a threat to the Catholic Church. King Phillip IV of France owed the Templars a considerable sum of money and was facing financial devastation. He conspired with the pope to arrest Grand Master Jacques de Molay and many other members of the Order. A significant number of members escaped and took up residence on pirate ships or remained as fugitives. Their underground organization of fraternal aid in keeping members of the Order alive and hidden form the Inquisition evolved into \"Freemasonry.\"¹ Both the Christian church and Phillip IV were able to confiscate the property and holdings of the Templars following the arrests and murders by the Inquisition and the disbandment of the remaining members of the order. Grand Master Jacques de Molay, burning at the stake, cursed the Catholic Pope and Phillip IV, that both would die within a year, they both did. Lucifer's New Aeon We are going into a new aeon, the Age of Aquarius. Aquarius is the 11th sign of the Zodiac. This is the “Aeon of Satan.” Here are some of the signs: • 1999, inverted, is 1666 (one-666). 666x3=1998. • 2000, in numerology is number 2; 11, (1+1=2) Two and eleven are the chief numbers of Lucifer. • 2000 was Year of the Dragon (the Dragon is one of the symbols of Satan) which marked the commencement of the 21st century. • 666- 6 x 6 x 6 = 216. 2,160 years is the approximate time it takes for the synetic vernal point to travel backwards from one constellation to another. Aquarius, the sign of a man (the water bearer) represents the coming new age. Ea/Enki also known as Satan is symbolized by the Water Bearer of Aquarius. The Gods placed much emphasis on the movement of the planets, stars, and constellations. They left images in stone, as seen in the Egyptian Sphinx, which was constructed during the age of Leo (10,500 years ago). The scarab, representing the ancient Egyptian sign of and the Age of Cancer, the rows of ram's heads (Age of Aries) and the monolithic sculptures of the twins (Gemini), are seen in numerous places throughout Egypt and Middle East. In 1962, the planets lined up- Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn all in the sign of Aquarius and ushered in the computer age, which emerged worldwide 28 years later following the Saturn cycle. Technology has advanced at an unprecedented pace in the past century. Atheist, Dr. Madalyn Murray O'Hair succeeded in removing the xian bible and compulsory prayer from the public schools in 1963.

Catholic nuns and priests gradually shed their vestments. Today, the wearing of formal vestments by the Catholic clergy in many parts of the world, especially in the United States is rare. The Catholic clergy has dwindled to where the lay people are taking over the former duties of Catholic priests and nuns. The remaining priests, most of whom are aging, are being exposed and brought to justice for the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and other revolting crimes that have occurred for centuries. The resulting lawsuits and scandals are breaking the Catholic Church. The Protestants have their share of crimes against humanity as well. We are now in the age of information and communication, which will result in many of these xian sects being exposed along with the Catholic Church. The 1970's band \"Black Sabbath,\" paved the way for heavy metal, death/black metal. The metal scene openly blasphemes the xian \"god\" and Satanic lyrics are very popular, especially among the youth. Look around you- Satanic music, movies, books, role playing games, video games, the internet with thousands of Satanic websites, Satanic t-shirts, Baphomet jewelry, and more. Satan is becoming very popular. Satan has the youth. During the 1990's, thousands of xian churches were burned worldwide. The xian churches are rapidly losing their credibility and reputations; as a result, many are lost and looking for answers. The xian religion was built upon murder, lies, injustice and appalling crimes against humanity and it is now facing the consequences. Knowledge is readily available and the lies and promises of the right hand path religions are no longer as effective as they once were. In the Al-Jilwah, Satan states that those who are without \"do not know the state of things that is to come. For this reason, they fall into many errors.\" We are reaching the end of the age of Pisces. It has been written that in the end, the truth will come out and many will want to join at the last minute, but it will be too late to do so. Yaweh/Jehova, the REAL \"Prince of Lies\" is not going after the small stakes, because he has had the judeo/xian/muslim religions for centuries. The bible bangers are in for a rude awakening. 329"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"330"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Meditations 331"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"What You Should Know Satanism and the Kundalini Serpent Bioelectricity, what it is and what it does: Bioelectricity is also known as the life force, the chi, the body electric, prana, the aura, the spirit, witch power, etc. There are many different names for this energy. Our bodies run on bioelectricity. Thoughts are electrical impulses in the brain. The brain runs on bioelectricity. When this electricity becomes imbalanced, one has seizures. The amount of bioelectricity an individual has, determines the degree of their physical, psychological and spiritual health. People, who are ill or depressed, have lesser amounts of bioelectricity. Depression all by itself, is a symptom of too little bioelectricity. Bioelectricity increases our energy, our immunity to disease, our charisma, instills a positive outlook, and strengthens our thought power. With increased bioelectricity, our thoughts (electrical impulses) become stronger and are more able to manifest themselves in reality. Some examples of bioelectricity include: • Buddhist monks, who sat motionless in the street, (protesters), were soaked with gasoline and lit on fire. They continued to sit still and burn to death. • Martial artists: busting through concrete with their fists, knife hand \"karate chop,\" enduring major, crushing, and lethal blows, unharmed. • Dim Mak: the deadly martial art of inflicting light specific blows to chi (a variation of bioelectricity) meridians (acupressure points of bioelectric energy flow) during specific times that can cause delayed death, sometimes up to five months later. • When the mind, through fear, panics, or when one is in a life and death situation, this sometimes enables an individual to lift extremely heavy objects, for example, back end of a car, that under normal conditions, would be impossible. • Telekinesis- The ability to move objects with the mind • Pyrokinesis- The ability to set things on fire with the mind • Electrokinesis- The ability to control objects, such as computers that run on electricity • Levitation- Some martial arts and yoga masters have the ability to levitate their bodies into the air. The strength of one’s bioelectricity is the foundation of all magickal success. Old spells with strange ingredients have little or nothing to do with the success of a magickal working, the success depends upon the strength of the mind and the aura (the bioelectrical field) that with proper focus and direction, will affect one's environment and others. Those known as the Gods (very powerful and advanced extra-terrestrials who have genetically modified their DNA so they don't age), have much of this very energy. Lucifer is known as \"the shining 332"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"one.\" Many of these Gods \"known as Demons\" are radiant with this very energy. The hieroglyphs on the walls in the Egyptian temples, tombs and inside the Egyptian Pyramids explain how important this energy is in becoming a God. Reaching true Godhead is difficult and requires consistent hard work and dedication. Mastery of the mind is essential. The spirit, as long as you are alive, is a part of the physical self. Yes, many of us can astral project (leave our bodies at will), BUT, the physical self acts to empower the soul as long as we are alive. My experience with the dead is they do not evolve in power any more, beyond what they had when they were alive. A spirit remains a spirit until they reincarnate physically. Only through the strength of the soul (powerful bioelectricity), will one ascend into godhood. Kundalini and the chakras: Kundalini is the highest form of yoga. It is a god thing. All of the tenets of Yoga, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc., and the western religions, preach helplessness, instruct one on how to be a total victim and try to make sure the results obtained from these disciplines are kept under strict control, if obtained at all. Sacred writings (hiero means \"Holy\" and glyph means \"symbol”) left for us in Egypt (one of the original centers of True Satanism) are instructions for becoming a god. The objective of mainstream religions, both east and west, is to keep humanity enslaved and powerless. These religions use fear is used as a tool. \"Karma\" this, and “Karma\" that. Satanism does not preach helplessness. Satan is brilliant, fearless, incredibly strong, and defiant. He rebels against limitations placed upon freedom. The Chakras There are seven chakras located along the spine that are the most powerful. These are the \"seven seals,\" written about in the Christian bible book of “Revelation.” These are \"The seven lamps of fire that burn before the throne of God.\" They are referred to as \"seals\" because the enemy aliens sealed them in humanity to prevent our acquisition of godly power and knowledge. We have been cut off from spirituality and the astral world. Thousands of years ago, we were as the Gods, until the earth was attacked and there was “war in heaven.” Our being sealed has caused the human race to degenerate. Imbalances in this energy and blockages, along with holes in the aura cause drug and alcohol addiction, depression, a lack of concern for the feelings of others and other forms of life, abusive behavior and many other things that plague humanity. Kundalini The SERPENT OF FIRE is the symbol of kundalini. It lies dormant, coiled at the base of the spine, beneath the Muladhara chakra. The objective is to ascend the serpent (powerhouse of energy) from the base of the spine, through all the seven chakras and out through the crown chakra at the top of the head. In order to do this safely, all seven chakras must be completely open and unobstructed. In order to handle a large amount of bioelectricity safely, one's body must be strong and all of the seven chakras must be fully open. Kundalini is the life force and is very sexual in nature. This is the reason the Christian church and other RHP religions ban masturbation and all forms of sex. Sex is the creative power; it is one’s use of the life force to create another human being. When one is trained and adept, the use of this force can be applied to many other objectives. Hatha (physical) yoga can be a big help in stimulating and opening the chakras and very recommended. By increasing our level of physical flexibility, the life force flows easier. One only needs to look at the stiffness of old age and the ill health that accompanies it, old age precedes death. 333"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"There are many different methods of awakening this power. Some of these include: • Chanting- Vibration is very powerful. The power of sound can break glass, weaken steel, and cement structures. Vibrations cause the chakras to open and stimulate the kundalini at the base of the spine. • Controlled Breathing (pranyama) - Different methods of controlled breathing are specific to each chakra. We are all aware how important the breath is to the life force. The Egyptian God Thoth has said many times \"Life is in the Breath.\" • Visualization and concentration- Through visualizing and focusing our minds on each chakra, we can open, close and control them. • Revamping the bioelectricity ideally, should be done slowly and gradually. One’s physical and spiritual self is accustomed to operating on a certain voltage of bioelectricity. Increased Bioelectricity: • Can induce intense bliss. • Strengthens and intensifies the aura. • Gives a feeling of lightness, floating, glowing and assists in astral projection (where one wills one's soul to leave one's body and return safely). • Opens one's mind for spirit contact and telepathic communication. Will enable one to resist disease and also provide the power to heal one's self. • Protects the immune system. • Provides the power to work magick- true magick without props- empty handed. This is the art of the true adept. Ceremony is unnecessary. LIMITATIONS ARE NOT A PART OF SATANISM. 334"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The Kundalini: Transformation Through Power Meditation There are some things I feel I should mention concerning power meditations. Unfortunately, in life, rarely, if ever, does any serious transformation occur without pain. People who want power- so called supernatural power- will find in most cases, they will have to go through pain in order to achieve this. Our bodies and minds are used to running on a certain amount of life force. When we begin to make some serious alterations with this very life force, certain nasty side effects can crop up. This is a given and is also individual. The life force, like any electricity is HOT, BURNING HOT. There are different physical responses to extreme heat within the body. Some which are quite unpleasant. Inflammations, eruptions, burning sensations and so forth are the most common. Knowledge is everything- to know what can be expected is to understand. One clergy member found his metal pendant that he always wears has become so hot it burned a mark into his skin. This sort of thing passes, though it can take anywhere from a week or two, to a few years. Once the physical self adjusts, the soul has been completely transformed. This is no different than strength and mass building through weight lifting. I remember when I first began working out- there were times I couldn't even get out of bed I was so sore. It took a few years, but the bone density and body strength/mass I have are permanent. Remember, in meditation, the same thing. Unlike physical exercise, once you enter a point, there is no turning back. You can only move foreward. Stopping can be disastrous in some cases. One may lighten up, but this will do little as a certain point has already been crossed. ****Very few, if any articles or materials contain any contraindications concerning the effects of advanced meditation. 1. People who are epilptics or have had any siezures, should either take it EXTREMELY slow or not at all. You are increasing the electricity within the body and the brain- enough said? Even in normal people, physical adjustments to the increase of electricity can cause mild siezures. 2. Everyone should ALWAYS make sure the air they are breathing in during meditation is clean. Deep breathing is no different than aerobic exercise such as running/jogging and will affect the lungs and system accordingly. Cold air can cause pleurisy, inhaling polluted air, lung problems. Keep this in mind. Signs the Kundalini is about to ascend: 1. Spontaneous physical/electrical energy surges can cause jerks, twitches, shaking, energy waves and even convulsions. 2. Increased sensory awareness- heat, cold, sounds, strong tastes, odors, heightened sense of body image or absence of such, feeling a strong burning aura, disturbing thoughts (this is why void meditation is necessary to banish them as is a strong mind). 3. Sleeplessness, insomnia. one woman did not sleep for 5 months 4. On the upside- increased understanding, much easier communication with demons and the 335"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"6th sense is increased and enhanced greatly. feelings of extreme bliss, peacefulness. 5. The external environment does not have any affect- people getting angry, you remain calm. This is the awakening stage of the Kundalini. Much wil depend upon the individual. Ones health and any former meditation done in the past. The stronger you are in every respect, the less problems. Kundalini/bio-electrcity is hot like molten lead. A warm sensation at the base of your tailbone- some of us have felt a pulling upward- sometimes spinning sensation. This indicates your kundalini has been activated. All of the chakras must be completely open and unobstructed. The serpent of fire willascend piercing through each chakra. for some people, this is as hot as a glowing iron. One must stay focused and direct the energy out the crown chakra. The kundalini will sometimes crackle and roar as it flashes like blinding white lightening as it hits the 6th chakra. This can be brightness beyond anything you have ever experienced or seen in your life. This is where calm, complete control comes in. Kundalini is individual for everyone. What some people may experience, others may not. Thoth wrote that the greatest obstacle to true spirituality is FEAR. This is where the strong survive the weak. One must have no fear. Father and your Guardian Demon will guide you. They will also push you when necessary. People talk that they want extra-normal ability ad power- this is the way, but nothing comes without pain in this life. Many talk the talk, erroneously believing they are \"already a God.\" For most, this is just a legend in their own minds. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 336"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"The Effects of Awakened Kundalini on the Mind Kundalini and the energy of the chakras is bio-electricity. Our brains run on bio-electricity. This can be seen when some people have seizures. Our thoughts are electrical impulses. When we revamp our bio- electricity, we stimulate areas of our minds that have been and are normally dormant. Kundalini can kick up old fears, unpleasant thoughts and all kinds of things that have been buried in our minds. This is just a stage. Void meditation and the ability to banish thoughts at will, is a definite help here, as negative thoughts serve no real purpose and tying into them is a waste of time, unless it is for a specific reason, as one wanting to deal with them. This is just a stage and will pass in time. Ignore any negative thoughts if they surface and they will go away. As we can see, by focusing our attention to our chakras, we empower them. Focusing on and turning our attention to anything can give it power. Ignore something and it will wither away. People who have or have had a tendency to seizures need to be extra careful with kundalini stimulation. People run the gamut with different experiences. What one does not experience, another will. Remember to take it slow and stay close to Father for guidance. Less is always better, with these exercises, but regardless of any experiences, one should go FEARLESSLY. The weak, usually those of the RHP who practice yoga and are not evolved, when they run into problems, they become fearful. This lack of character and control completely fucks them. Remember, FEAR is NOT a part of Satanism. If you ever get overcharged, just laugh it off and don't take it seriously. 337"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"The Fourth Dimension The Fourth dimension is what we experience when we astral project, enter a portal to another time, or experience in an altered state. When someone breaks a limb, the limb is placed in a cast. When the cast is removed, the limb is withered, shriveled, and needs rehabilitation in order to retain its former range of movement and strength. Meditation opens a part of our mind that is defunct. Centuries of xian religious control have made most of us unaware of the fourth dimension, both psychically and scientifically. As humans, we can only see a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Insects can see ultraviolet light. Certain animals can sense many things that a human cannot. Just because someone cannot see or hear something, that does not mean it doesn't exist, as with ultraviolet light, X-rays, gamma rays and other forms of energy. When we open our minds, it takes time for us to adjust. I have had a lifetime of being psychic. Even though I was an atheist, I always had another sense, though I tuned out the spirit world. In coming to Satan, the so called supernatural increased 100 fold in my life. What is a typical day to many of us would completely freak out the average person. People had a hard enough time just being around me at work, as they began to \"see\" things (nothing really psychic, just enemies getting punished and so on). To me, this was just another typical day. One time a bottle of cleaning fluid half way down the aisle flew off the shelf and in spite of having a screw on lid, the thing was open and running. The guy who was working with me (he knew I am a Satanist) freaked out. Hearing voices and seeing things are the most common manifestation of opening up our minds. This will pass eventually and come under control. This is like exercising. At first, you are sore. Then, things come together. With performing power meditations for given any length of time (they should be done every day), you will experience some serious power. You will no longer need props, spells, or rituals to get what you want. I was reading where this CoS member wrote where LaVey advised people to use props in order to \"amplify\" emotions and energy. For those of us who do these mediations, this is totally unnecessary. Your intentions will not need to be amplified. If anything, you will find your emotions and personal power will need to be controlled and toned down. You will see what I mean if you are doing the meditations consistently. Those who are lacking in power need the crutch of props. These people are helpless whenever something happens out on the street as they have to have material objects they rely on to perform any ritual or working. For an adept, just looking into someone's eyes will often do the job. This is where intensity needs to be controlled and toned down, unless one is seriously offended or threatened in some way. You will feel your own intensity and power and also feel the reactions of others to it. Science has not progressed to explain the fourth dimension. This is where we interact astrally, and where our Demons are at when they come to us. I was confused about the fourth dimension. Azazel came to me and lied beside me. I asked him about this and he told me, even though he is physically elsewhere, his consciousness is beside me. 338"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Concerning Encounters with Undersirable Entities When we open ourselves to astral, there can be times when we experience unwelcome intruders. People who are impressionable, emotional, and overly sensitive can have these problems more than the average. A strong mind and the ability to banish thoughts are important. All of us should have the ability to defend ourselves psychically, if necessary. Sometimes strong unwanted encounters and influences can come from other human beings. Christian prayers and thought forms directed at us, can make us feel ill at ease, cause us confusion (especially for those who are new) and throw us psychically off balance. Knowing the source of unwanted influences is a formidable part in defending ourselves. Spirits can be unwelcome intruders. Unlike other religions, Satanism exposes us to many different experiences, so that we may become strong, knowledgeable, independent, and confident in our own abilities. Outsiders who have little or no experience with the astral are completely at the mercy of any entities they may encounter, because of a lack of knowledge, preparation, and experience. Having a strong mind is of extreme importance in *any* dealings with the spirit world, being able to banish unwanted thoughts at will and having control over emotions. Any weaknesses can be exploited by an unwanted entity with more power. Being able to cut someone or something completely off, at will in one’s mind is the first step in psychic self-defense. Unwanted entities feed off fear and our giving them our attention. It is important to focus our minds elsewhere and totally ignore unwanted or bothersome entities. Without a steady supply of psychic energy, nearly all will leave. Void meditation should be done every single day. This can be done anywhere, anytime. Just empty your head of all thoughts and concentrate on the here and now. Impressionable people who live in their own fantasy worlds and dreamers have the highest risks for psychic intrusion along with an inability to effectively deal with it. This also includes those who abuse mind altering substances. When a link is established, it is a psychic feeding line for the intruder entity. With unwanted entities, the link forms where one is weakest. This can be fear, loneliness, a lack of knowledge or any other area where one is insecure . Now, I am talking about *unwanted* intruders, *not* Demons or entities with whom we have a healthy spiritual relationship. Since all spiritual relationships thrive on interaction and emotion, the way to deal with an unwelcome entity is to completely cut it off and starve it of any and all psychic energy. In addition, if you pretend to yourself that the spirit does not exist and refuse to respond to it in any way, it will wither away. This may take days or weeks, but indifference is the most effective weapon against spirit intruders, they will eventually leave. Other effective methods of psychic self-defense include grounding oneself. Get physical, indulge yourself physically, watch something funny and lighthearted on the TV, and just turn your mind away from magick and the occult for a while. It is also a good thing to meet with friends- anything to focus on the physical world and forget the astral. When our minds are preoccupied and focused on something of interest, even the most determined spirit will have a hard time getting through. Avoid right side of the brain activities, like listening to music, artwork, video games, and mentally drifting. Being adept at controlling thoughts, emotions, and minds is very important if you ever wish to invoke spirits as a medium and let them speak through you. You control the spirit; you are in charge, not the spirit. When I am finished invoking a spirit and letting it speak through me to others, I turn it off 339"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"completely. Over the past several years, I have come under attacks from angels frequently, given I am directly involved in spiritual warfare. I experienced quite an ordeal when freeing the Demons as this took several months and angels would harass me, at times relentlessly. They would attack me, even physically, beating on my legs in the middle of the night. When things got real bad, I called on my Guardian Demon who had been freed and he chased them away. I never conversed with any of them, in spite of their threats and at times, there were some who even tried to bribe me. I would only respond to them with ‘You are wasting your time.” This was all I would ever say. When we got started in freeing the Demons, a few were extremely desperate and tried to bribe me into freeing them immediately. The energy drain was intense as we connected our souls to the souls of the Demons and transferred our life force at the chakras. I told them that I only take orders from Satan and they would have to go through him, according to the order he wanted them to be freed. I just stayed extremely focused. The others who worked with me on this project experienced a lot of the same. In closing, one of our High Priests had experiences with greys. He related that the energy and mind power these buggers have is monstrous and they are on the warpath. He survived them because he is highly adept. Remember, if anything ever gets beyond your control- call upon Satan himself or your Guardian Demon. The above situation is rare. Those of us who are the biggest threat to the enemy are the most attacked by them. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 340"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"The Number Seven I have studied many different writings and occult teachings. I have come to my own conclusions regarding what I have read. The old grimiores and occult writings, along with Enochian magick all emphasize the number 7. Many authors interpret this to correspond with the 7 planets. It is a well known fact that ancient (B.C.E.) peoples knew more about the solar system and universe than modern science gives them credit for. They knew of 12 planets, not 7. The significance of the number 7 is not within the planets, but within the 7 major chakras. In Egypt, there are numerous heiroglyphs depicting the Gods using Ankhs and metal rods to tune their chakras. Initiation into the Ancient Egyptian Priesthood required one's opening all of these chakras with the methods I have been and will be writing about. The 7 chakras are the powerhouses of the soul. Open these the correct way and empower them and you are indeed on your way to achieving equality with God. Father Satan breathed the breath of life into the body of man. This is where he met with serious confrontation and opposition from the other Gods. We were never meant to have these chakras. They have been sealed. All high magick must have power. This power comes from the chakras. These Awakening exercises are not very well known and are very effective for opening and empowering your chakras. With the first exercise, if you have done this, you should feel a pressure or a knot in the middle of your forhead. This must be done 3 consecutive days, 24 hours apart. This is extremely important. You should never have to do it again after this. Once and it is a done deal for nearly everyone. **There is a very small percentage of people who have their pineal gland so atrophied, they must do the exercise again after a waiting period of 2 weeks, but this is extremely rare. You will know whether or not you opened your 3rd eye because you should feel it. Pressure in the middle of the forehead, headache at the forehead, feeling a knot above the brows. These are all signs your exercises are doing what they are supposed to be doing. It can be immediate or up to a month or more before you notice a powerful change in your psyche. The opening of the 3rd eye seal will enable you to have a lot of power normally dormant in outsiders. It is my belief that the number 7 has to do with the chakras; \"the seven lamps that burn before the throne of God\" SATAN IS GOD. -High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 341"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Concerning the False Philosophy of Yoga The ego is the self. \"As above, so below,\" we need to work as a unit in order to advance. The Sanskrit word, \"yoga\" means \"union.\" In my work as a medium, I invoked many spirits of deceased humans. On the astral, deceased souls stagnate and do not change or evolve. One needs a physical self in order to advance the soul. Due to the right hand path teachings, many practitioners of the eastern disciplines have little knowledge of how to use their powers. The teachings of selflessness, sacrifice, asceticism, denial, ignoring the physical self and chastity (absence of sexual relations) are for the purpose of preventing humanity from accessing any mind power. One needs the physical self in order to advance the soul. Mastery over the physical self is another matter. An adept should be able to transcend pain. Mastery over the physical self and ignoring/neglecting the physical self are two very different things. When one neglects the physical self, one creates disunion. Yoga in this case is no longer a concept. The same goes for ego and desire. We should not let our desires dominate our lives, but without desire, life itself becomes meaningless. Our wants and desires are what make us unique individuals, and give us the personalities we have. Without desire, we stagnate and have nothing. Desire motivates us and our ego is our self. By denying the essential parts of ourselves, we break up the union. The practice of yoga or any other disciplines would not even begin without desire. Without desire, we have nothing. Strong desire, along with a strong mind and will is what makes magickal workings successful. When the life force is strong, there is a strong desire to live. Absence of desire is death. When we no longer have desires, we stop living. Most of us will agree, upon meeting and uniting with Satan, he brings us together spiritually. We have a feeling of wholeness that we didn't have before. The popular yoga teachings are here only to deter us from power, like all of the teachings of Christianity and the other related religions. IGNORE THEM. Only use the physical techniques. There are stages one goes through in the activation of the chakras and kundalini. Some of these stages are a lack of sex drive and lust. This is because the kundalini is sexual and when we begin power meditation, this energy is directed into different areas of the soul. People have also reported having much more intense orgasms once the kundalini is stimulated. Orgasms are much more intense and pleasurable with more bioelectricity. Sex should, if possible, be an addition to kundalini awakening. Kundalini is the life force and very sexual in nature. There are murals on the walls of the pyramids and temples in Egypt. These murals are of the Gods tuning their chakras. The male Gods are always shown with a full erection when undergoing this process. The life force and sex drive are the same. By centuries and centuries of preaching the lies of abstinence and self-denial, these teachings have kept humanity enslaved both physically and spiritually. When the life force is strong, one does not experience depression, apathy, futility, or hopelessness. 342"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"More About the Philosophy of Modern Yoga As Satanists, we are all well aware that good and evil have been inverted by the enemy. The teachings of the xianity and its related religions are chock full of spiritual abuses and suicidal advice in order to create easy victims. Most victims are ignorant of the truth. Knowledge is power. Most eastern teachings have one sole purpose- to enslave. The few, who have knowledge concerning the workings of the mind for the past several centuries, have perverted and abused spirituality in order to keep and maintain power. When we access altered states with our minds, through meditation or even involuntarily, and when we go to sleep, our brain waves slow down. In this state, we can access the astral and we become very open to suggestions. Those who are without and adhere to the behavioral shaping teachings of yoga, Wicca, and other metaphysical disciplines are opening themselves up to the worst kind of victimization. They condition their minds to be receptive, more so than the average person. With the doctrines advocating destruction of the ego, the absence of desire, rejection of materialism and the physical self, and adherence to unhealthy dietary laws, these people are just waiting to be enslaved and programmed by the enemy. When one is not grounded, one is just waiting to be controlled, manipulated, and made into a slave. Subliminal messages, media mass mind control and other influences have a ready victim, easily manipulated. Rejection of the material leaves all of the money and material wealth in the hands of a few, without having to lift a finger. The people who believe and do what they are told screw themselves. The teachings of reincarnation have been perverted and distorted in order to make life meaningless, with unquestioning obedience, self-denial (while those in power get richer); the message is don't fight back, just be the perfect slave. Many, these days, are into the disciplines of yoga. Anyone who is aware of the science of criminal hypnosis, as the special agencies of the world powers are knowledgeable in mind control, knows they are creating an army of mindless robots, absent of desire and under their control. These people open up their minds to all kinds of influences and suggestions, work at eliminating their personalities and everything else that makes them human and know nothing of how to use the power they work at obtaining, leaving it as a tool to destroy themselves, as it is undirected. Only through Satan, can we obtain the knowledge to make full use of our powers. We must remain grounded and down to earth, while we work to empower ourselves. By empowering ourselves as a spiritual/physical unit, our will, our individuality, our desires, our egos, our personalities, we obtain the benefits of the exercises, while others are misled down a false road. There are tons of books sold and thousands of websites, almost all of them promote the abuse of spirituality; turning those who mindlessly believe these perverted teachings into victims of their own making. The end product is the mindless, robotic slave who is a lost soul. Yoga means “union” and its origins are Satanic. The spiritual cannot exist without the physical and visa versa. What the enemy is teaching is not true yoga. Without desire and will, one is nothing. Yoga is a threat to the enemy as it endows practitioners with spiritual and physical power. Because it cannot be completely suppressed, the enemy works to control it with false teachings for those who practice, and for those who don’t, there are powerful subliminal messages to frighten the ignorant away.

The meditations I have posted are EXTREMELY powerful, especially when done consistently and combining them. You must have all of yur chakras open as these meditations can stimulate the kundalini at the base of the spine and cause it to rise. Signs that can alert you that your kundalini is about to come up are: 1. A warm feeling in the base of your tailbone or your ass. 2. A spinning, pulling sensation in this area, like a pulling up. 3. A strong feeling of energy that draws your attention to this area 4. Feeling like you want to rock back and forth or more so, doing this involuntarily You must be prepared for this both physically and mentally. If you are experiencing any of the above and feel you may not be ready, take this seriously. All you have to do is stop meditating for a few days or better yet, concentrate on making sure each and every one of your chakras is wide open. You must be strong both physically and mentally. If your kundalini begins to ascend, it can literally be as hot as molten lead up the spine. You must not lose your concentration at this time, but concentrate intensley on directing the energy out your crown chakra that will act as a vent. When it hits the 3rd eye, it can flash like lightening and roar. A strong mind that is in control is everything here. Warning signs of chakra blockage: 1. Extreme heat during meditation in any area of the chakras. This indicates blockage. 2. Pain in the above. The meditations, especially the Egyptian meditation, when combined with a couple others is very powerful for prematurely raising the kundalini. This will raise your life force 100% or more and a strong physical body is needed to handle it. People who have a backround in strength training or athletics are better able to handle this energy. Above all, should this happen, regardless of your present physical condition, your body will adapt, but it can be most unpleasant and take up to a year. Mastery of all emmotions is essential. Fear is OUT. Whenever doing ANY spiritual work, one must NEVER let in any fear. FEAR = FAILURE . For those who are new and/or inexperienced, if you cannot control fear, replace it with laughter. 344"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"The Mind Physics of the Soul There is a sub-atomic particle, discovered in 1956, called the neutrino. This particle, because of its extremely tiny size, and elusive behavior is difficult for scientists to study. The missing 9/10ths of the universe is thought to be comprised of neutrinos and neutrino-like particles. Although neutrinos have mass, they pass right through physical matter. It has been estimated that a neutrino from the sun would stand a good chance of penetrating a thickness of lead stretching from Earth to the nearest star without colliding with anything. Recent developments in physics, astronomy, and neurology provide an unexpected breakthrough into the understanding of psychic and paranormal phenomena. The atoms of our physical bodies contain the much finer and faster vibrating neutrinos and neutrino-like particles. These finer and faster vibrating particles compose the substance of the soul, that is joined to our physical body by a magnetic cord that breaks at the moment of death. The soul breaks loose from the body when the body is no longer able to function as a home for it. When one applies one's self to consistent power meditation, one's chakras vibrate at faster speeds. This takes training, preparation and readiness, but through the higher speeds, approaching the speed of light, one is able to access other dimensions at will. Humanity currently resides in a lower dimension. This has much to do with our earth and its position in space. In higher dimensions, colors, shapes, sounds, and thoughts are more vivid. One can see through walls and have the sensation of omnipresence. Telepathy is extremely enhanced and other senses become much stronger and more open beyond anything most people have experienced. 345"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Brain Waves There are four main types of brainwaves: Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta. Beta waves characterize the conscious waking state at 14 cycles per second and up. The conscious mind does not take suggestion very well. Reasoning, logic, thinking and putting into action what it already knows is mainly what the conscious mind does. Higher cycles of beta waves are used in rituals where a lot of active energy input is needed, as in revenge. A good example is in building a circle cone of power. The more excited one becomes, the higher the cycles per second in the brain. The alpha state operates at a lower cycle, 7-14 per second level. This is the trance state when the body can no longer be felt, and sounds may become painful. This is the meditation and sleep range. Deep meditation descends into the theta state. In the alpha state, one is open to suggestion as the conscious logical mind is subdued. The conscious defense barrier is down. Hypnosis takes place on this level. When in the alpha state, we can program our own and/or the minds of others. The deeper you go into alpha, the closer you get to theta. We can influence others when they are asleep or in the alpha state. This is one reason most mages prefer to do their spell work at night when most people are asleep. Talking to someone who is sleeping will act to program his or her mind. This can be done, even at a distance with intense concentration, visualizing the individual, and directing thoughts into his/her head. This may have to be repeated several times. The strength of your mind and aura will determine your success. Make sure the thoughts you place in his/her mind are commands, as in telling someone something you want them to do for you. Be calm, but firm and persistent. It may take a while, depending on the strength of your mind, but in time, results will manifest. Psychic experiences can happen in the alpha state. Both daydreaming and sleep dreaming occur while in the alpha state. The theta state is 4 - 7 cycles per second. This is where all of our emotional experiences are recorded and is of the subconscious. The theta level opens the door to descend even deeper into the psychic/astral world. While it is possible to have psychic experiences in the alpha state, the most profound experiences occur at the theta level. At this level, one is able to experience astral travel and psychic communication, achieve enlightenment, and enter into other dimensions; this is where past lives can be accessed. Brain wave activity in the delta state ranges from 0 - 4 cycles per second. This is total unconsciousness, coma. When in the alpha state, visualizing our desires, as if they are real and actually happening will make them manifest in reality, especially if affirmations are included. In theory, it is said the subconscious mind believes what it is told in this state to be true. Affirmations must be stated in the present tense. The subconscious mind does not understand the word “will” as it is in the undefined future tense. “Will” never happens. Make sure the wording is exactly what you want and look at every aspect, or something unexpected and fated could cause things to go wrong. Wording is important and must be planned carefully. One woman wished to win a contest. She repeatedly told herself she would be the best and went through the entire mental exercises. It turned out she was the best, but because of the biased judges, she lost the contest. The more intense your visualizations, the stronger your mind/thought output will be to act in attracting what you desire. Becoming proficient with descending into the Alpha level is usually necessary before you can easily descend into Theta at will. This can be achieved through self-hypnosis. 346"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"The Location of Occult Power in the Brain The pineal gland is the part of the brain that empowers what is known as the \"sixth sense\" and other paranormal abilities. It is also the center of bliss sensations. The pineal gland is defunct in the average person. A defunct pineal gland is analagous to a severed spinal cord where the brain cannot send messages to move the body parts beneath the area that has been severed. The only difference is it affects the soul. Through the centuries, because of Christianity and its related \"religions,\" humanity has devolved and degenerated spiritually. This is why the human race as a whole is psychically powerless. The goal of the Christian Church always has been to keep humanity without knowledge, and without power. Any time the Christian Church took control of an area, the ancient records were removed and/or destroyed. The church then replaced the knowledge it removed, with lies and a fictitious history. This is why the human race is where it is at today spiritually. Depression, illness, misery, helplessness and ignorance are the results of the loss of this knowledge. The average person only uses 5-10% of his/her mind power. This is analagous to a limb that has been immobilized in a cast and is stiff and withered, only worse. Humanity has been denied access to psychic powers through a generational lack of use and has all but lost them. In order to activate the pineal gland, power meditations must be must done regularly. It takes time to empower this gland and to activate it and use it. The pineal gland works in conjunction with the pituitary gland. Both of these glands are stimulated through the opening of the crown meditation. The Pineal and Pituitary adapt and lower the frequency of bioelectrical currents. They are psychic energy transformers. Psychic energy enters through the higher chakras, and descends down through the crown chakra where it enters the pineal gland in the brain. As it enters the brain, the rate of vibration is slowed down. An active pineal gland acts as a transformer that further slows down the energy to a 347"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"lower frequency. The energy then enters and moves from the hypothalamus region of the brain into the pituitary gland. The pituitary further transforms the energy to an even lower frequency so that it can be assimilated and read by the brain. Humanity as a whole is operating on a low frequency. Power meditation and spinning our chakras speeds up this vibration to a higher level where we are psychically open and aware. A higher vibration also protects us against illnesses and negative energy. The Corpus Callosum works to exchange information between both hemispheres of the brain. Most humans do not use the right side of the brain, as we live in a left-brained world. Void meditation silences the left side of thinking and logic, and opens us to the right side, which is the intuitive/psychic side. Light is essential to the soul. So much negativeness has been associated with light because of the abuse of RHP religions and the new age movement. Light is connected with lightening which is symbolic of the creation and is an age old symbol of Satan; the lightening bolt. We can travel on light and use light for our own purposes. Unlike other religions, Satanism and science work together. We experience, we see and we understand. Satan explains things. 348"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Clairaudience (Psychic Hearing) Clairaudience is the term for psychic hearing. With the increased sensitivity that comes from a consistent program of power meditation, one can open one's mind to hear sounds on the astral. In the early stages of opening one’s mind, astral sounds can be heard inside of the head; the same as with thoughts. When one progresses, sounds can be heard outside of the head and are much more powerful. Clairaudience usually begins with hearing astral sounds inside of one’s mind. In the beginning, at least with my own experience, the things I heard outside of my head were nonsense and had no value. These occurred when I opened my crown chakra. Like everything else, clairaudience takes time, meditations to open up the psychic ears and major chakras to be able to access this dimension of astral sound. When one advances, celestial music can be heard. This is most beautiful. Father Satan visited musician Giuseppe Tartini in a dream. He heard Father play the most beautiful violin music, “indescribably beautiful.” He awoke and wrote down what he could recall, but he could never duplicate the beauty of the music. He named the piece “The Devil’s Trill.” All frequencies of energy have their own sounds. The entire universe runs on vibration. One of the most interesting experiences in clairaudience is hearing the sounds of the cosmos. The more psychically open one becomes, the more likely he/she is to encounter different sounds. Anything from bells to ringing, buzzing (this is the bioelectricity; in Ancient Egypt, the bee was a sacred insect. Tutankhamen’s rear headdress (coffin) has a bee stinger attached in gold), flute sounds, roar of the ocean and others. Certain sounds can be annoying, but these symptoms will fade away as one’s system gets used to the heightened level of the life force. The Seven Ears relate to the seven chakras. By focusing ones awareness on them during meditation and opening them, the ability of clairaudience will manifest. To open them, visualize a star opening up for each one and shining brightly. After this, increase the brilliance and diameter. Opening these energy points will enable one’s mind to hear the astral and unlock pathways for healing energy to circulate. This can be helpful for people who have problems with bad eyesight, hearing, headaches and other problems. Meditating on both the psychic eye and ear points is very powerful for receiving messages from the astral. Remember, if you ever hear anything you don’t like, just tune it out and shut it off. 349"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Errant Thoughtforms and Meditation The most commonly known example of a thought form is the “haunted” house. For a place to have an energy about it, a very emotional event took place, usually a violent death or a murder. The fear, anger, and destructive emotions are so powerful they leave behind an essence most people (even the average person) can detect. There is no greater energy than that given off at the time of death and if the death was violent, the entire area can reek of it for centuries. Thoughtforms create a mass of energy. They are the result of intense emotions and thoughts. Their lifespan is determined by how much energy is put into them. Continually dwelling upon something over a period of time gives the thought/emotion energy which takes on a form of its own. Every individual is different according to the strength of his/her aura and thoughts. Some people are born with a naturally strong mind and aura owing to previous lifetimes. Most people have thoughtforms attached to their aura. The results of daydreams, fantasies, anger, hatred, desires and so forth, when repeatedly dwelled upon, form permanent thoughtforms. Thoughtforms can be either positive or negative. Either way, they can interfere with a person’s thought processes. When we meditate, we increase our energy. The thoughtforms we have, feed on this energy. Power meditation is a sort of cleaning house process. We can tune into and remove these, same as we can do with others who have attached themselves to our souls. Removing these will bring clearer thoughts and peace of mind. It is a healing process. 350"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Hypnosis About Hypnosis We all have a right side and a left side brain. The left side of the brain is our conscious mind that we use every day to make conscious decisions and use logic. This is the active masculine side of the brain. The passive side is the right side of the brain. This is the receptive feminine side. The right side of the brain is highly suggestible and the side we access in both meditation and hypnosis. In order to access the passive right side, the active left side must be subdued. This is analogous to turning off the electricity in a home or building in order to access the wiring. If the electricity is not turned off, a shock will prevent accessing any wires. The mind works the same way. The more subdued the active left side is, the deeper the trance, the deeper the trance, the more receptive the passive right side is. In order to effectively hypnotize yourself, you must be deep in a trance. To hypnotize another person, you must put that person deep into a trance- the deeper, the better. In order to hypnotize someone, the operator must establish some sort of rapport. People who are highly suggestible, impressionable, and gullible make the best subjects. Those who are nervous, cynical, and uncomfortable with being hypnotized are difficult to work with. The CIA and other unethical professionals use barbiturates to put resistant subjects under. They use just enough so the mind will still be receptive to suggestions. If too much is used, the session will prove futile. The success of the session depends upon how set the mind is regarding the suggestions. Chronic and longstanding problems, deep seeded hang-ups, and mental blocks require many sessions to overcome. The suggestions and affirmations must be repeated and repeated to break down walls in the mind. With hypnosis, the operator is in control. The extent of this control with a professional is equal to the subject turning his/her entire life over to the operator who can command him/her to do anything. There have been numerous reports of psychiatrists putting their patients under and having sex with them. The patient was told during the session she would not remember the incident upon awakening. This is a common example. When you allow another person to hypnotize you, you are literally putting your entire life in their hands and with each session, you become more and more under that person’s control. In order to prevent any other person from hypnotizing you, you have to program your mind that you will never be hypnotized by another person. This creates a block. Hypnotists have been known to place their own blocks in the minds of their subjects. Some have placed several. The most common is the subject experiencing total amnesia concerning the session. Other blocks used by unethical hypnotists include the subject only being able to be hypnotized by the operator and no one else. These involved court cases where the operator used the amnesic subject to commit crimes. The human mind can be programmed to experience amnesia given any situation. Determining the Depth of a Trance The light trance state: • The subject is physically relaxed 351"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"• The subject's eyelids may flutter or twitch • Sounds may become painful Light to medium trance state: • The subject's limbs feel heavy • The subject's breathing becomes slower and deeper • Intense feeling of deep relaxation (the subject does not feel like moving, speaking or thinking) • The subject feels detached from his/her surroundings Medium trance state: • The subject is aware of the trance, but cannot describe it • Suggestive state (For example, the operator suggests the subject has an ant on his/her arm and the subject can actually feel it crawling, even though there is nothing there or the operator suggests there is smoke in the room and the subject smells it, though there is no smoke) • Catalepsy: A condition characterized by lack of response to external stimuli and by muscular rigidity, so that the limbs remain in whatever position they are placed. Deep or somnambulistic trance state: • The subject can open eyes without affecting the trance • Fixed stare and pupil dilation when eyes are opened. • Complete amnesia • Systemized post-hypnotic amnesia • Uncontrolled movements of eyeballs • Sensation of lightness, floating, swinging or falling • The subject experiences a distortion of sound • The subject can control his/her involuntary body functions- i.e., heart rate, blood pressure • Recall of lost memories • Age regression • Visual hallucinations • Auditory hallucinations • Total Anesthesia Methods of testing the depth of the trance: The operator must establish the depth of the trance in order to remain in control of the session. This is done by testing the subject for their receptivity to the operator’s suggestions. The most common method used is where the operator tells the subject he/she cannot move his/her arm. Example: ”Your arm is stuck to the chair, you cannot lift it, and when I count to five, I want you to try to lift it. If you have cooperated, you will find that the harder you try to lift your arm, the more it remains stuck to the chair.” 352"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The operator then counts to five, saying after each number, “Your arm is stuck to the chair.” When five is reached, if the subject cannot move his/her arm, they are in a trance. If the subject can move his/her arm, he/she has not accepted the suggestion. The operator must start all over again and explain he/she can do nothing without the subject’s cooperation. It is always important to secure the trust of the subject. The next stage is where the operator deepens the trance and again checks to see how deep the subject has gone. The operator tells the subject he/she will stroke the back of the subject's hand and he/she will feel an increasing numbness and loss of sensation in that hand. After a few minutes of stroking, and speaking, the operator pinches the back of the subject's hand and then does the same with the back of the other hand that has not been stroked and asks the subject if he/she can feel any difference. If the subject replies that there is a difference, this stage of trance has been achieved; if not, the operator explains to the subject that further work on deepening the trance must be done. More sessions will be needed to take the subject deeper and deeper. The next stage the operator tests is an even deeper stage. If the subject has advanced to this stage, he/she will be amnesic. The operator tells the subject to imagine that he/she is standing in front of a blackboard with a piece of white chalk and instructs him/her to take the chalk and write three words on the board. \"Now I want you to take the chalk and write the following three words on the blackboard: First, tree; next grass and lastly cloud. Raise your arm when you are finished writing the three words.\" When the subject has signaled he/she is done writing the words, the operator instructs him/her that there is an eraser on the ledge of the Blackboard and says \"I want you to take the eraser and erase the words tree and grass, leaving only the word 'cloud.' As you erase the words, I want you to also erase them from your mind, so that all you can think of now is 'cloud' 'cloud.' You are going into a deeper and deeper sleep. You are in a deep, sound sleep and all you can think of is the word 'cloud.' Now, what were the three words you wrote on the blackboard?\" If the subject is able to remember the three words, he/she has not yet reached the amnesic stage of trance. If not, the subject has reached this stage of deep trance. The operator should then say \"When I count to three, you will then remember the three words and repeat them to me.\" The subject should then be able to remember the words and repeat them. In order to be able to place the subject in this stage of trance the next time the operator performs the hypnosis, he/she should tell the subject before bringing him/her back \"From now on, whenever I put you into a trance, you will have reached the same depth of trance as you are in now by the time I have counted to ten.\" The operator then brings the subject out of the trance: \"I am now going to count up to five. When I reach five, you will be wide awake and feel refreshed and fine.\" Self-Hypnosis For self-hypnosis, you need to get yourself into a deep trance. The following is an excerpt from \"A Treatise on Astral Projection\" by Robert Bruce: How To Enter A Trance Relax and calm your mind through breath awareness. Imagine you are climbing down a ladder in the dark. Don’t visualize a ladder; just imagine you can feel yourself doing it. On the exhale, feel yourself climbing a step or two down the ladder. On the inhale, feel yourself holding still on the ladder. What is needed is a mental falling effect inside your mind. This changes the level of brain wave activity from the awake level (Beta) to the asleep level (Alpha) or the deep sleep level (Theta). Once your level 353"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"of brain wave activity reaches Alpha you will enter a trance. Keep doing this for as long as it takes. The time it takes to enter trance will vary, depending on your experience with deep relaxation and mental calmness. Note: Once you get the heavy feeling, stop the mental falling exercise. If you don’t like the ladder, imagine you are in a lift [elevator], feel yourself falling on the exhale and holding on the inhale. Or, Imagine you are a feather, feel yourself floating down on the exhale and holding still on the inhale. As I stated above, you need a mental falling effect to lower your level of brain wave activity. This mental falling effect, when combined with deep relaxation and mental calmness, will cause you to enter the trance state. Feel free to use any scenario you are familiar with to bring about this going deeper feeling. A trance feels like: Everything gets quieter and you feel like you are in a much bigger place. There is a very slight humming feeling in your body. Everything feels different. It feels a bit like putting a cardboard box over your head in the dark, you can feel the atmosphere change. It’s like everything goes fuzzy or slightly blurred. Any sharp noises, while in trance are painful. Deep Trance The level of trance you achieve depends greatly on your relaxation, concentration skills and will power. To enter a deeper trance, i.e., Theta level and beyond, you have to concentrate much more and for much longer, on the mental falling sensation aided by breath awareness. The first level of trance, i.e., when you get very heavy, is quite deep enough for projection. I strongly advise against forcing yourself deeper than a light trance, until you have plenty of experience with the trance state. How can you tell if you are entering a deep trance? There are four very noticeable symptoms: 1. An uncomfortable feeling of cold that doesn’t make you shiver, coupled with a steady loss of body heat. 2. Mentally, you will feel very odd and everything will feel extremely slooooow. Your thought processes will slow down as if you had been given a strong pain killing injection. 3. You will feel disassociated from your body, i.e., a strong floating sensation and everything will seem far away. 4. Total physical Paralysis. Note: These four things, ALL TOGETHER, signify you are entering a deep trance. Do not mistake the mild floating sensation you sometimes get with light trance, i.e., as you astral body comes loose. Or the slight loss of body heat from sitting still for a long time and the mild paralysis, i.e., the heaviness, for a deep trance. The sensation of deep trance is quite uncomfortable and unmistakable for what it is. It is very difficult to get into the deep trance state, as you need highly developed relaxation, concentration and trance state skills plus lots and lots of will power and mental energy. You will not accidentally fall into it. If you are worried you are going too deep, remember this: You CAN pull yourself out of it at any time. Concentrate ALL your will on moving your fingers or toes. Once you can move a finger or toe, flex your hands, move your arms, shake your head, i.e., reanimate your body; and get up and walk around for a few minutes. Falling into a deep trance should not be a problem with these exercises. Energy Body Expansion At some point after entering the trance state, you will feel a mild paralysis come over you. This will soon be accompanied by a deepening vibration and a buzzing feeling all over. You may also feel like you are huge and swollen. The paralysis, vibrations and the huge feeling are symptoms of the energy body expanding and the astral body loosening. This is part of the normal sleep process. The energy body expands and opens in order to accumulate and store energy. During this, the astral body drifts 354"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"free, slightly out phase with the physical body.\" [End of Excerpt] Some people use a tape recorder and listen to the talking through and statements. The drawback here is when in a deep trance state, sounds can become painful and jar the nervous system. Everyone is individual and one should experiment to find the best individual methods. What works for one person may not work for another. While in this state, you can regress into a past life, by walking through a door or \"portal\" in your mind. The deep trance state is the time to make repeated affirmations to yourself to program your mind. Self- hypnosis is much like hypnotizing others, with the exception, you make the statements to yourself. Again, several sessions may be necessary. Bring yourself out slowly and gradually, as you would do in returning from the astral Hypnotizing Others It is important to read all of the articles in the hypnosis section so you know what you are doing before hypnotizing another person. In order to effectively hypnotize another person, that person must be completely and deeply relaxed. The person should be sitting comfortably in a reclined position. When lying down, the subject is likely to fall asleep. You must stay calm and in control at all times. Begin by talking the subject through total body relaxation. Start at the feet, have the subject tense them up and relax them; then the ankles, the calves, knees and so on, working your way to the subjects face and head. When the subject is fully relaxed, tell him/her to remember a happy event that took place in their past. Ask him/her questions about it, where it took place, who was there, how he/she felt, what was in the room or area the event took place and so forth. This is done to activate the intuitive right side of the subject’s brain and the subconscious mind of memory. When you are finished with the above, tell the subject you are going to count backwards. With each number, he/she will become more and more relaxed: • “Ten; you are becoming more and more relaxed than before.” • “Nine; you are drifting down deeper and deeper into total relaxation” • “Eight; your body is totally relaxed; you can barely feel your body. • “Seven; you are completely relaxed and feel very peaceful” • “Six; with each breath, you are relaxing more and more with each exhalation.” • “Five; we are going all the way down into the deepest level of relaxation.” • “Four; relax... three, two, one You want to determine the depth of the trance at this stage. If the subject is new to hypnosis, more sessions are usually needed before he/she is able to enter a deep trance. To deepen the trance: 355"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"• “Ten; you are becoming even more and more relaxed than before.” • “Nine; you are descending and drifting down deeper and deeper” • “Eight; your body is totally and completely relaxed • “Seven; with each breath, you are relaxing more and more with each exhalation.” • “Six; we are going down further and further into a deeper and deeper level of relaxation.” • “Five, four; relax...three, two, one.\" Again, you want to determine the depth of the trance at this stage. If the subject is new to hypnosis, more sessions are usually needed before he/she is able to enter a deep trance. Repeat the steps directly above this paragraph if the subject is still not at the desired level of trance. Here is where you will program the subject’s mind. Make short to the point statements that deal with a specific area or problem. Only work on one problem per session and make sure the problem is resolved before moving onto another. Make all statements to be in the present tense. \"Will\" never comes and the mind does not understand the future tense. For past life regression: Put the subject into a deep trance and say: “I am going to count backward from 10-1.” \"With each number, you will enter a deeper and deeper state of relaxation.\" “When I reach one, you will be standing in front of a door.” Slowly count backwards. “You are standing in front of a closed door. I am going to count backwards from ten to one and when I reach one, I want you to turn the knob and open the door.\" “....3, 2, 1.\" Now ask the subject if he/she opened the door. If not, he/she is not deep enough into the trance for this session to be effective. Either put him/her further under or bring him/her out of the trance and end the session. If he/she opened the door, then say: \"I now want you to walk through the door. You are now in a previous life.” “Look around you, what do you see?” “What is the current date” “Who are you?” Continue talking him/her through the experience When you are ready to bring the person out- “I am going to count from one to five.” “At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, alert and feeling fine.” “1...2...3...4...5” \"Open your eyes.\" If you wish to do a mind wipe, where the subject will not remember anything from the session, be sure to tell them at the end of the session “When you awaken, you will remember nothing of this session.” “Your last memory will be coming through the door.” (Whatever happened before the session). With professional hypnosis, a mind wipe is often necessary of the subject experiences trauma during a regression. Examples: Attracting wealth- 356"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"“You are attracting more and more money.” “Your life is filled with wealth and you have everything you want.” (Similar statements for money) For Healing: Have the subject to visualize a bright ball of light like the Sun. Tell him/her to visualize this light on the afflicted body part. \"The light is healing energy, that is healing your______________. Say to the subject: “Visualize a ball of bright light, like the Sun. Do you see the ball of light?\" The subject should answer, “yes.” “I want you to place the ball of light on your (name of body part).” “Completely surround (name of body part) with the ball of light, feel the warm energy healing your_____.” “The light is full of healing energy that is healing your (name of body part).” “Your______is becoming normal and healthy” Keep talking the subject through this healing process. This may have to be done several times, especially if the problem is chronic. Hypnosis is useful in many areas. It can be used to strengthen concentration, improve intelligence and memory, rid one's self of phobias, and bad habits, establishing good habits and so on. Power Hypnosis Power Hypnosis is a form of self-hypnosis that is extremely effective. With standard self-hypnosis, one enters into a trance and makes repeated affirmations to modify behavior. With power hypnosis, one breathes in the energy of a specific color that corresponds to the desired goal. The results are much more extensive and powerful than just plain self-hypnosis. With power hypnosis, we work with our aura. Here is an example of power hypnosis: Say you want to attract money: Breathe in as you would for the energy wave; from all sides of your body at the same time, the color green. A bright, rich vibrant green. This should be done while in as deep as a trance as possible. While breathing in the green and brightening your aura with it affirm: \"I am breathing in powerful energy that is attracting me a lot of free and easy money in a very positive way. This money is free and all mine to keep.\" Say this several times with intent while you breathe in the green. The green is the color of Venus and the heart chakra which rule money. It really works, but has to be done every several days to keep the money coming. Afterwards, breathe in vibrant white light to blance your aura for several breaths. Say you want to lose weight: You would want to use sky blue to speed up your metabolism and affirm: \"I am breathing in blue energy that is speeding up my metabolism in a healthy way and causing me to 357"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"lose excess body fat.\" You have to repeat this several times anywhere from 5-10 and continue breathing in the blue energy. This will have to be done daily until you see results and repeated whenever necessary. Always make sure you say \"in a positive\" or \"in a healthy\" way. Mind workings always take the easiest route and you don't want to get thin through disease or obtain money through the insurance claim form the loss of a loved one. Be sure to cover all your bases when working with your mind. Bioelectric Technology and the Black Arts of Hypnotism Each of us has an electro-magnetic field around our bodies. This is what we know as the aura. Our thoughts and the activity of our brain form a circuit within that aura. Since thoughts and brain activity are electrical impulses, they can be decoded and read. The world powers are well aware of this and with advanced computer technology, are able to decipher a person's thoughts, where they can be received by a special device and the out put is much like when satellite signals are formed into a picture on our TV sets. There are also microchips that can be used as implants along certain neural pathways to send electrical impulses to the brain, stimulating certain thoughts, feelings, beliefs or implanting certain memories. Although this technology has a way to go, there are now actual thought reading machines, which, like everything else in time, will be perfected. A device is placed upon a subject’s skin at certain points that reads the bioelectrical output and decodes these impulses to where they can easily be read with a special computer. During the 1970's the world powers acquired major advances and breakthroughs in mind control technology. Hypnosis has many positive applications, such as healing or breaking certain habits. Most \"professional\" hypnotists agree that when under a hypnotic trance, the subject will never act against his/her own will or perform acts contrary to his/her own nature. This, in reality is bullshit. A trained and confident operator can impel a subject to do anything he/she commands him/her to do. 20% of the population is perfect subjects for hypnosis. Above average intelligence, the existence of an imaginary playmate in childhood, a strong tendency to daydreaming and fantasy, and the will to comply make one a desirable candidate. In the black arts of hypnotism, the hypnotist and subject form a master/slave relationship. The subject must be isolated from friends and family and spend much time alone with the operator, where a rapport is established, as in government experiments or sometimes as one does with a cellmate in prison. An emotional rapport is very important in establishing trust and obedience. The operator must come across as a good listener and show supposed genuine interest in the subject. The subject is made to feel comfortable around the operator and can be open with him/her. The initial hypnotic induction is the most important, as it breaks through into the subject's mind and opens a door to the hypnotist. When in the alpha state, the logical mind is inactive, and one is open to all suggestions. The operator gives the subject the suggestion that he/she will become deeply hypnotized again whenever the operator gives the induction cue. This can be in words or a signal. Each session induces a deeper hypnotic state where the subject slips under the complete control of the operator. With deeper trances, the subject becomes more and more powerless against the operator. Artificial amnesia (also known as a \"mind wipe\") is induced by the operator suggesting to the subject that he/she will not have any conscious knowledge of the session. Further important suggestions 358"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"include that the subject will not in any way be able to be hypnotized by anyone else and that he/she will act in a trance, just as if awake. Once the subject is easily hypnotized by the operator, the mind and personality can then be conditioned. Childhood playmates are often extensions of one's personality, especially in those who are of weaker character and would not fight back personally or defend themselves. The imaginary playmate can fight back and get angry, where as the child cannot. Often, there is an abusive parent, to whom the angry thoughts and actions of the playmate are directed against. During the initial conditioning phase of the session, the operator regresses the subject into childhood. Regression plays a very important part in establishing control over the subject. An operator who works for the government as in producing spies, will look for the most aggressive of the imaginary friends, in attempting to artificially split the personality. The most aggressive aspects of the personality are the ideal in destroying all inhibitions. Artificial splitting of the personality occurs where the imaginary playmate is brought out in the subject and the subject becomes the playmate on cue. The playmate usually emerges through one of the subject's chakras. The operator informs the subject that \"playmate's name\" will come through subject's stomach, third eye, throat, etc. The subject is further told again that he/she will not remember anything of the session or the emerging personality. In actual cases, the emerging stronger personality is conditioned through programming and suggestion to be hostile to the root personality of the subject. This aggressive personality in nearly all cases is stronger and can take more abuse. The world powers use the subject as robotic spies. Extensive programming is instilled in the aggressive personality, so that they will never divulge certain information, even under torture. The root personality, who is amnesiac of the entire experience is often the one who endures systematic torture, with no memory or recall of the information the interrogator is attempting to force them to reveal. Through repeated sessions the personality is brought out more and more and becomes much stronger, completely splitting off of the root. The subject, due to being programmed not to remember, has no knowledge, only gaps in time and missing pieces in the memory. Much time slips by unnoticed and is unaccounted for. Further conditioning sessions, while under, include talking the subject through an experience completely abhorrent to their nature, where the subject is made in his/her mind to do something he/she would never consciously do. The subject actually experiences what the operator says. Through repeated sessions, all inhibitions are overcome and the personality is shaped into whatever the operator wishes. This is where the subject, for example, can murder ANYONE without hesitation or do anything else the operator commands. Like anything else, repeated programming is instilled and maintained in subsequent sessions. Barbiturates can be injected into a stubborn subject that will render his/her mind open to whatever suggestions the operator wishes to instill. This is known as \"Military Psychology.\" Charles Manson was known to take less drugs and to be more in control and aware than the other members of his family. This is how he put many under his control, without their knowledge. People on drugs are extremely easy to control either psychically, as a skilled mage would do, or in an actual clinical setting. He learned these methods in prison and applied them. Drug use also puts holes in the protective aura that can easily be manipulated by an adept. Electric Shock Treatment works to destroy memories and can be used to wipe the mind clean by agencies within the world powers. The mind is then reprogrammed, beliefs, ideas, thinking patterns, and habits are instilled, usually through trance induction by drugs, until the new personality takes hold and the drugs are no longer needed. This is known as \"brainwashing\" and can be done for all purposes. 359"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Most people are unaware of what can be done to their minds by those who have more knowledge and control. Self-hypnosis is useful in where we, ourselves, program our own minds. We can program our minds to be resistant to all unwanted influences. In addition, others will not be able to influence our minds or establish control over us in any way. 360"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Past Life Amnesia; How it Affects This Life Many things are fated with one’s being in the wrong place at the wrong time, with the wrong people, again at the wrong time, accidents, illnesses, missing something by a day or minute. All of this is the result of a lack of knowledge. Reincarnation is a fact. When we enter a new life we bring ourselves with us. This includes past hang-ups and former conditioning, mistaken beliefs, grief, pain and so forth. When we enter a new existence, we do so under amnesia. There is information available concerning certain experiments. Many of these have been kept from the public because of their cruel nature, studying the effects of artificially induced amnesia on both animal and human subjects and how it directly affects the feedback circuit in the brain. With self-awareness, one can exercise control, but on the other hand, when the feedback circuit is blocked through amnesia, one is prevented from reforming problem programming in one's mind. Russian psychologist, Ivan Pavlov conducted a series of experiments on dogs. Most of us are familiar with the theory of conditioning, taught in Psychology 1001. Dogs were given food after a bell was rung. The bell, after several times, caused the dog to salivate (anticipate food), whether or not the food followed. The sound produced hunger in the dog. Two separate stimuli, applied within seconds of each other will create an involuntary response in the brain. Many of his experiments went beyond the conditioning. He was able to produce nervous breakdowns in dogs and other animals, again, by association. The hungry animal would go for the food and he would apply painful shocks, extremely loud noises, blasts of scorching heat or other stimuli creating a survival verses fear/pain situation. This created neurosis and mental illness in the animals, in the same way the xian church has ruined the mental health of billions by enforcing the abstinence of sexual intercourse and denying other normal and natural needs. Sexuality is equal to the life force; abstinence creates neuroticism. The enemy gods know all about the human mind and how to destroy it. Another Russian scientist, A R Luria continued Pavlov's experiments, but this time on humans. (The CIA does this as well, although much has been kept from the public). Luria found that humans, being able to remember, were able to resist the programming and restore their minds through rational thought and the application of will. Luria, (along with the CIA in later years) induced amnesia in his subjects through electric shock treatments, and drug induced trance states where 99.9% of humanity can be hypnotized and reprogrammed. Electric Shock treatment (EST) has been used to treat and control mental illness. EST causes retrograde amnesia. Memories are destroyed, corresponding with the intensity and frequency of the shocks. With high level EST, one is unable to remember one's name, identity or past. The subject becomes extremely clam and focused in the present. The 1975 movie, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" is a good example of the effects of EST especially in the ending where the character, portrayed by Jack Nicholson, was shocked into irreversible brain damage with no memory of his identity or past. Disturbing thoughts and false memories can be implanted in subjects' minds by the operator's regressing the subjects into early childhood or infancy. At this stage, the mind becomes defenseless and helpless. The operator is perceived as and assumes the role of a parent figure. A prime example of this was where false memories were implanted by an xian psychiatrist in the subject of the book \"Michelle Remembers.\" Inducing neuroticism usually, though not always, requires the operator to regress the subject and implant false memories, such as the rape of the child by a parent. One hundred percent of the time, amnesia must be suggested to the subject so the subject will have no recall of the session or implanted 361"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"suggestions. Reprehensible false memories, fears, and all kinds of psychological problems can be implanted by suggestion in the subject’s mind such as the murdering a loved one, irrational fears, shame, and guilt. Amnesia prevents the subject from understanding the hang-ups and dealing with them. The subconscious mind retains them and acts on them. The subject is unaware of them, other than having strange, irrational feelings, unexplained neuroses, and abnormal behavior. Regardless, the problems are still there and affect the subject's future behavior. This is what happens when we experience amnesia concerning past lives. We have more experiences than we know hanging around in our subconscious minds and affecting us in this lifetime. We don't understand why bad things happen and we are powerless in many cases to prevent or stop them. The movie, Hannibal, is an example of what can be done to someone in a drug induced trance state, where psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter offered Mason Verger a popper (amyl nitrate), and suggested to him to peel off his face. In this fictitious case, there was no amnesia. We can begin to really know ourselves and take better control of our lives, by accessing past lives through self-hypnosis, learning, and understanding as much about them as we are able to. We all should take the time to enter our own trance states and explore our own minds, childhood memories, and past lives. Because of the curse of amnesia and the lack of knowledge, there is so-called \"karma.\" Karma can only be overcome and defeated with knowledge. Knowledge is the key to everything. Knowing everything about ourselves, past lives and so forth will set us free. 362"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Power One does not need props or other ritual items to cast a so called \"spell.\" The power meditations, done long enough are more than effective in one's ability to influence one's environment and others. When one's field is strong enough, it is easy to put thoughts, feelings and other projections into the minds of others. Some people are stronger than others and projecting can be met with some resistance, of course depending upon how strong YOU are. The stronger ones, though, have their defenses lowered considerable when asleep. Weak people are easy to deal with anywhere and everywhere. Just going into a mild trance of focus and concentration and you will notice if they are where you can observe these people, the obvious effects of your projections. Always remember, it is very important to learn to control anger. When one reaches a certain level, offenders, whether they are outsiders or loved ones will meet with misfortune. This can be very upsetting when a loved one gets into an accident or comes down ill as a result of your anger. This comes with power and should be controlled. When one's energy field is powerful enough, it does not take much. We must always be sure we intend for offenders to get punished. Unintentional anger, then the offender apologizes and the hard feelings are gone and then the person meets with disaster, this can cause much regret. I cannot overemphasise the power behind these meditations, when done long enough and with consistency- every day. For certain specific things, like binding, props can be used as a point of focus. Most of the time, just dwelling on something with will, focus and desire will make it manifest, provided it is not worried about or dwelled on in a doubtful or desperate way. 363"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Absorbing and Directing Energy Once you are advanced, you no longer have to actually breathe in energy; you can just direct it with your will, using your mind.

Just let go and a falling sensation should manifest. For inexperienced meditators, this might make you dizzy. If you feel real uncomfortable or dizzy, just focus on the front of your body to stop the free fall. The deeper you free fall, the deeper your trance state and the easier it is to work with your mind. When you have reached a deep trance state, visualize yourself walking towards a door in your mind. As you walk towards the door, tell yourself when you walk through the door, you will enter into your past life. This should be the life that preceded your life now. Walk through the door, look around at your environment. To go back several lifetimes, just visualize the door and tell yourself you are going back to whatever year you wish to regress to. To go forward in any past life, will yourself forward by asking your mind to take you to a specific stage of your life or year. Take the time to look around and ask your mind questions. To regress further through each past life, will yourself backwards by telling your mind to take you back further until you can regress no more, and again, walk through another door, telling yourself you are entering the lifetime before this life you are observing.

By this, I mean things most average everyday people disregard. Natural telekinesis, pyrokinesis, extreme clairvoyance, way above average perceptions, clairaudience, the ability to put thoughts in or will the minds of others, the ability to use one's bioelectricity to shut down, disable and/or affect sensitive electrical equipment- computers, televisions and other abilities are all examples of extraordinary ability. These gifts can also result from power meditations. If you find you have these abilities, keep them to yourself. Unbeknownst to many, the CIA, NSA, and other world powers have programs where they use people with these abilities.* People who have these abilities are a serious threat to the powers that be, because they cannot be controlled. The movie \"Hearts in Atlantis\" though a work of fiction, has much basis in fact. Gifted people who are under their thumb are able to sense others with the same abilities. There aren't too many people with extraordinary abilities just walking around freely out there. For those with abilities, you know what I am saying- when you come into contact with another person who has these abilities- they could be in the drugstore, supermarket, restaurant- you can sense them and they can sense you. You are aware of each other. This is because you both have an open energy field. You must program your aura (which is usually very large) to go about undetected if you wish to maintain your privacy. You can also program your aura not to affect electrical equipment unless you intend it to do so. You do this simply by telling it to stop doing what you don't want it to do. This may take several times, but should be effective. The same goes for thought reading. You program your aura so others cannot pick up on your thoughts. Of course, one with a much stronger energy field can overpower someone who is weaker, regardless of programming, but programming to go undetected should serve its purpose here. The USA, world powers, even China have programs where they employ psychics and those with abilities that one only sees in the movies. These people do not have freedom. They are used and many times murdered when they no longer serve a useful purpose to their employers.¹ Father Satan works with and protects those who have abilities. He protects us and when we are ready, he works to show us how we can empower ourselves to our fullest extent. Those who are without go it alone and their lives usually end in disaster. Those in power deny the existence of this kind of thing, making public statements that it was a \"failure\" and so on. This is not true.² For those of you with exceptional ability (very few in this group- you know who you are) I strongly encourage you to dedicate your abilities to Father Satan in a ritual. He will protect you, work with you, and guide you. This can be a lonely road, as others freak, are shocked, and/or become frightened. When others know our secrets, they have power over us. Remember this. Keep your secrets and you never have to worry. Above all- to the kids here- learn to develop control. Don't ever brag or show off. You can come to the attention of the wrong people.

Electrical equipment can gather and read the electrical fields generated on the skin (the aura) and translate sub- vocal speech into text. A body can become disabled by sending disruptive signals into a person's motor cortex; affecting motor control. \"To send a thought into a brain, it is necessary to decode the resonance frequency of each specific brain area.\" 6 Science has progressed to where they have deciphered the brain signals.

In time, suppressed emotions will be cleaned out and the soul will be able to advance and be much more free. One will find inner balance and peace. Learning is another thing. Satanism is intense and for many, embracing Satanism is a first time of coming into one’s own. When one acknowledges the years spent as a spiritual slave, without personal rights and is aware of years of unnecessary abuses, one may experience intense anger and other emotions.

TECHNIQUES 1, 3 AND 4 ARE EXCELLENT FOR BEGINNING MEDITATION OR TO GET INTO A TRANCE. Technique #1 1. Inhale slowly through your nose and visualize and focus upon energy being drawn into your base chakra and with the inhale, draw this energy up through all of your chakras to the crown, illuminating each one. 2. Hold for a count of four for new people, for an average, a count of ten and for advanced meditators, however long you feel comfortable. This should be the same count throughout the meditation. 3. Exhale slowly through your nose and visualize and focus upon energy being drawn into your crown chakra and with the exhale, direct this energy back down through all of your chakras to the base, illuminating each one. Technique #2 Breath of Fire (also known as Kapalabhati) Contract your abdominal muscles, forcefully, creating an exhale, by pumping your stomach muscles in and out hard and fast, but controlled. Air will enter the top part of your lungs by itself. Use the rapid contractions of your abdominal muscles to inhale and exhale with this exercise. The contractions should be rhythmic. 2. Practice a few times, and get a feel for it. 3. Do 20 in a row, in and out, using your abdominal muscles in rapid succession, and at the end of the 20th breath, exhale, inhale and fill your lungs, contract your anus, lower your chin to your chest, hold your breath as long as you comfortably can- DO NOT PUSH YOURSELF! 4. Exhale slowly. The above constitutes one round. The exhalation should be brief, and the inhalation should be passive and longer. Rounds are increased by adding the number of pumpings with your abdominal muscles. First, try doing three sets of 20 pumpings and then after some time, increase to 30, then 40 until you are doing 60. 370"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"What this breathing exercise does: 1.

The active left side of the brain blocks out any attempts to access the passive right side where the seat of the unconscious is. This is analagous to turning off the electricity to a room or a building in order to fix the wiring. The right side of the brain is where we can program our minds to manifest what we want in reality. To get into a trance state takes practice. Remember, each of us is individual and some may find this easier than others. The important thing is to be persistent and patient with yourself. Persistence and consistency are everything here. Performing breathing exercises before trance is highly recommended, as this will naturally calm the nervous system. 1. Sit comfortably. Do not lie down because you might fall asleep. 2. Breathe in for a count of six, hold for a count of six and then exhale for a count of six. Do this breathing until you are completely relaxed. Ideally, you should no longer be able to feel your body. 3. Imagine you are climbing down a ladder in the dark. Don’t visualize a ladder; just imagine you can feel yourself doing it. On the exhale, feel yourself climbing a step or two down the ladder. On the inhale, feel yourself holding still on the ladder. 4. Now, let go of the ladder and free fall backwards. If you get dizzy or disoriented, just bring your attention to the front of your body and this will stop. This mental falling effect, when combined with deep relaxation and mental calmness, will cause you to enter the trance state. What is needed is a mental falling effect inside your mind. This changes the level of brain wave activity from the awake level (Beta) to the asleep level (Alpha) or the deep sleep level (Theta). Once your level of brain wave activity reaches Alpha you will enter a trance. Once you get the heavy feeling, stop the mental falling exercise. If you don’t like the ladder, imagine you are in a lift [elevator], feel yourself falling on the exhale and holding on the inhale. Or, Imagine you are a feather, feel yourself floating down on the exhale and holding still on the inhale. You need a mental falling effect to lower your level of brain wave activity. 5. Keep doing this for as long as it takes. The time it takes to enter trance will vary, depending on your experience with deep relaxation and mental calmness. A trance feels like: Everything gets quieter and you feel like you are in a much bigger place. There is a very slight humming feeling in your body. Everything feels different. It feels a bit like putting a cardboard box over your head in the dark, you can feel the atmosphere change. It’s like everything goes fuzzy or slightly blurred. Any sharp noises, while in trance are painful. 6. To bring yourself out of the trance: Concentrate on moving your fingers or toes. Once you can move a finger or toe, flex your hands, move your arms, shake your head, i.e., reanimate your body; and get up and walk around for a few minutes. 374"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"What this exercise does: In order to advance in psychic power, we must train our minds. When we are in a trance state, our brain waves slow down considerably. There are two sides to the brain- the left logical/intellectual masculine side and the right creative/intuitive feminine side. The right side is the seat of the subconscious. This is the area of the mind that is open to suggestion and programming and the seat of our astral power. When the left side of our brain is active in thinking, the right side cannot be accessed. Trance states shut off the left side so we can access and program the right side (subconscious). It takes training to be able to induce a deep trance state. Deep trance states are not always necessary, but for specific workings, they are very important. Once we train our minds to go deeper and deeper into a trance, this becomes easier and easier and takes less and less time as we become adept. The mind is like a muscle and for most people, this exercise will be an introduction to a part of the mind that has never even been accessed before. It is *very* important to never be startled out of a trance state, especially a deep one, so make sure you are in a room or area where you are left alone and the phone is turned off. Being startled and pulled out of a trance the wrong way can be extremely painful and the pain can last for days, especially if you are doing energy work in this state. It is normal when in a trance state for any sounds to be very painful. This is because in this state, our senses are extremely heightened. An adept can place themselves in a deep trance within seconds at will. In closing, it is not necessary to always go into a deep trance to work with your mind. The trance state is used to train your mind. With very important or difficult workings, a deep trance is often necessary. 375"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Opening the Chakras (Awakening Meditations) Opening your soul will open your spiritual eyes and lead you to see the truth and obtain enlightenment. In addition, you will discover many so-called \"supernatural\" powers within yourself when you empower your chakras. When the chakras are correctly aligned and empowered, healing of both physical, and mental ailments will often occur miraculously. Azazel who is a Master of Spiritual Alchemy worked with me in detail on each one of these meditations. 7/21/07, several have been revised in light of new knowledge. These meditations are extremely powerful and often, the effects can be felt hours later. It is important to follow instructions and if you are new to power meditation, to go slow. If you have already done the former meditations, it is fine to do these. Quite a few people reported little or no effects from the former meditations that were taken from books. There are a certain number of repetitions for each exercise. If you find you are getting over stimulated, it is advised you end the exercise and back off. The exercise can be resumed at a later date while you give your nervous system time to adjust to the increased life force. It is strongly recommended to give yourself a few days or more between each exercise. People who have problems with seizures/epilepsy, or who are on psychiatric medications should not perform any of these power meditations, with the exception of void meditation, unless given the ok by their physician. They are highly effective in opening the chakras and stimulating the kundalini. These new meditations are filled with Satanic energy. Those who have not dedicated or are outsiders should give this consideration. For dedicated Satanists, the effects should be very positive in opening and empowering the chakras and in increasing personal power. These meditations produce very rapid results. Standard kundalini meditations of the New Age variety can take years to have a pronounced effect. These meditations, like Satanism are the real thing. Void meditation is highly recommended in order to control the thoughts and mind that will be stimulated by the opening of the chakras. There are a certain number of repetitions for each exercise. If you find you are getting over stimulated, it is advised you end the exercise and back off. The exercise can be resumed at a later date while you give your nervous system time to adjust to the increased life force. The meditations are performed with specific chants for each chakra. Each chant is based on the Yogic Humming Breath. With this breath, you inhale to fill your lungs and with the exhale, you vibrate the chant until you are out of breath, then you breathe in and fill your lungs as before. This breath is normally used with the throat chakra; 1. Inhale through your nose, filling your lungs 2. Exhale on one long vibration, this will draw out the exhale 3. Breathe in again and repeat. Some of the chants/vibrations are based upon runes. Runes are based upon the constellations and are the most ancient of alphabets. They are the original form of writing and the cuneiform script was derived from them.* Many of the runes can still be seen in the cuneiform characters. The runes have 376"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"always been an abomination to the xian church, more so than with any other form of magick. For the first through fourth chakras, it is necessary to apply what is known as the \"Jalandahara Bandha.\" This is where you nod your head and press your chin firmly, but gently against your chest. This greatly facilitates the effects of the chants in the lower chakras. Mudras (hand positions) are used as these connect certain circuits within the fingers and redirect the life force to the chakra being opened. Some of these are difficult, especially if your hands are larger. These mudras are helpful, but not necessary. If you find any of these hand positions difficult, just leave them out. You should focus on the chakras in the middle of your body. Extensions are along the spine and in the front of the body. Opening and empowering these are more advanced and specific meditations are given in the advanced meditation volume. Too much stimulation right away is undesirable. Everyone comes to Satanism on different levels. Those of us who empowered our souls in past lives will be much more sensitive to the meditations. This is inborn, but anyone who performs the following exercises will eventually open their chakras. * From Azazel 1.Opening the Third Eye This exercise is done with a specific tone and chant. You need to do this exercise for 4 days in a row. Regular meditation on the third eye should follow to completely open it up and establish an energy uptake. This exercise only gets it going. Further work is needed and must be consistent to reap maximum results. 1. Sit with your back straight. 2. Place your hands in the position as shown in the photo. Your for people who are right handed, your right hand should make a fist around your left index finger; for people who are left-handed, your left hand should make a fist around your right index finger. The thumbnail should press on the side of the finger as shown, at the spot where the cuticle ends. When you feel a very faint electrical shock, you will know you have the correct spot. Don't get discouraged if you cannot find it. It should be apparent in those who have naturally stronger auras. What this does is redirect the flow of energy to the third eye. 377"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"This mudra can be used at any time during regular meditation on the third eye. Keep this position throughout the meditation. 3. Breathe in through your nose and on the exhale vibrate \"Thoth.\" Thoth is the Moon God and the ruler of the 6th chakra and third eye is the moon. Release your breath slowly through your mouth and vibrate: TH-TH-TH-TH-OH-OH-OH-TH-TH-TH in one long exhale (vibrate the sound one time per exhale, as with the Yogic \"humming breath\"). Now this is important. Keep the TH and OH sounding at the same time. You should be making the TH sound all throughout the exhale. Your tongue will be vibrating between your teeth. It may take a few seconds to adjust this to where you feel it in the middle of your forehead (3rd eye), don’t worry, just keep on going. Try to get it to the correct vibration where you can feel it in your forehead. This can take some experimenting. Just do the best you can. You may have to try as many as ten to fifteen times or more to get it right. 4. Do the above 4 times in a row and then relax. 5. Now, align your third eye correctly by visualizing it point end facing inside as illustrated at left. The color of the third eye is brilliant white, like a miniature sun. 6. It is very important the above exercise be done for FOUR consecutive days, preferably 24 hours apart. Then it is a done deal and you will have performed the initial step of opening and activating your third eye. 7. After you are finished, it is important to meditate on your third eye to get the energy flowing, this way it will fully open. Just close your eyes and \"look\" at the 3rd eye in the middle of your forehead. It is important to relax and not to strain your eye muscles, even though your eyes are closed. At first, there is usually just blackness depending on how active your 3rd eye is, then possibly swirling colors and shapes like a kaleidoscope. Like scrying into a mirror, the colors and shapes will give way to images when you do the meditation long enough and regularly. Remember to keep your gaze soft and relaxed. Feeling pressure here or a knot is normal after the above exercise is completed. This usually diminishes in time. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT: 1. One of the first experiences is a headache or pressure in the center of the forehead. This sensation may also feel like it is originating from within, usually an inch or more beneath the surface of the forehead as it affects the sixth chakra. This is a positive indication the pineal gland is awakening and beginning to function in a healthy manner. You may also find you can feel this ache or pressure whenever you focus your attention on your third eye or meditate on your third eye. This is perfectly normal and eases with time. *Some people can experience a migraine lasting several hours. The severity of the side effects will depend on how atrophied your pineal gland is to begin with. 378"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"2.Opening the Crown Chakra and Awakening the Pineal Gland In order for this to work properly, you must have already performed the Opening of the Third Eye. The effects of this exercise are extremely pleasurable. A feeling of lightness should follow. Some people may feel energy or tingling inside their heads, or completely covering their heads; a slight pressure in the crown area and intense euphoria. The pleasant light feeling is what makes astral projection and astral travel easy. The bliss state can occur hours and even days later. When done properly, this exercise will stimulate the pineal gland and crown chakra. By continually stimulating the pineal gland, it will grow and become active. The pineal gland is the psychic seat of the soul. With this revised meditation, the chant is much more powerful and effective. It is based on the Björk rune.* Opening this pathway is also very healing for drug addicts as it naturally induces extreme pleasure. This exercise should be done only to initially open your crown chakra and stimulate your pineal gland. The vibration is very intense and effective, but produces quite a headache which can occur the following day. If your crown chakra is open, you will feel a lightness and a sense of bliss. If you do not experience these indications after a period of 4-5 days, you can redo this exercise again as many times as needed to open your crown. After this initial exercise, there are different meditations you can do to activate your pineal gland and stimulate your crown chakra further. I will be adding these to the meditation section and also link them on this page. 1. Breath in deeply and hold your breath for a count of 4; do this 5 times. This helps you to be relaxed, focused and enter into a trance state. Then focus all of your concentration on your 3rd eye. You should begin to feel a slight pressure sensation or awareness of your 3rd eye. 2. Now, place your hands in the position shown at left and take a deep breath as you did for the awakening one exercise and hold it for as long as comfortable- (do not push this) and release your breath vibrating b-b-b-b-b-b- b-b (vibrate with a deep, soft hum with the lips almost closed) The vibration should sound like a bee. The bee was sacred in Ancient Egypt and many other ancient cultures for this very reason. It is ok to adjust your pitch. You should focus on and feel the vibration in your third eye, then focus on your pineal gland. You should be 1/3rd the way through of your drawn out vibrating exhale and feel the vibration in your pineal gland. Then focus on your crown chakra and feel the vibration in your crown chakra and continue to extend your exhale as long as you are able to. Breath in again, repeat this 4 times. This exercise is extremely powerful, much more powerful than the former version. Now, VERY IMPORTANT- Remember to concentrate on your forehead (3rd eye area), then your pineal gland and finally your 379"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"crown chakra. You should regulate the exhale so it evens out. This is done for the duration of each chant. Summary: 1. Breath in 2. Begin to exhale, vibrating b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b 3. Concentrate on and feel the vibration in your 3rd eye 4. Concentrate on and feel the vibration in your pineal gland 5. Concentrate on and feel the vibration in your crown chakra Repeat 3 more times for a total of 4 times. Now align your crown chakra by visualizing it point down as illustrated at left. The Björk rune bestows intuition, protects energy, gathers and directs the powers of the four elements, is healing and revitalizes the life force. 3.Opening the Throat Chakra To activate the throat chakra, fold your hands together as in the photo, thumbs touching side by side- do not fold the thumbs. **This hand position is difficult. For those of you with larger hands, it can be skipped. It is best to be relaxed and not in any pain or discomfort while performing these exercises. Take a deep breath; hold as in the other awakening exercises and then vibrate: \"Nebo\" until your breath is fully released. N-N-N-N-EH-EH-EH-EH-B-B-B-B-OH-OH-OH-OH The important thing is to feel it strongly in your throat, above the hollow. Do this 5-7 times. Remember- getting the correct tone can take some practice. The chant should vibrate your throat area. This exercise can be done once a week or more as needed. 380"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Now align your throat chakra point down as illustrated at left. 4.Opening the Heart Chakra Azazel explained the crossing of the arms completes a circuit that directly affects the heart chakra. 1. Sit comfortabley, relax and go into a meditative state. 2. Cross your arms as in the example at the bottom of the page. Your hands should be touching your shoulders near your arm pits. 3. Position your hands so your thumb connects with your ring and little finger, leaving your index and middle fingers pointed straight. 4. Take a deep breath and nod your head so your chin is gently pressed into your chest. Keep your chin firmly against your chest during each exhale, only raising your head to inhale. 5. Focus your attention on your heart chakra. Exhale and vibrate \"Amon\" AH-AH-AH-AH-M-M-M-UH-UH-UH-N-N-N 5. Focus your attention on your heart chakra. 6. Extend the N-N-N-N-N until you have completely exhaled. Try to adjust the tone so you feel it in the middle of your chest where your heart chakra is located. 7. Repeat eight times. 8. Visualize the image at left, where your heart chakra is and yourself engulfed in a vibrant green aura and focus your attention on feeling your heart chakra for several minutes. Try to adjust the tone so you feel it in the middle of your chest where your heart chakra is located. 381"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":" 5.Opening the Solar Plexus Chakra 1. Sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight. 2. Relax and go into a meditative state. 3. Place your hands in the solar mudra illustrated at left. 4. Inhale fully and drop your chin to your chest. Keep your chin gently, but firmly pressed against your chest throughout the entire exhale, only raising your head during the inhale. 5. Vibrate \"RA\" R-R-R-R-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH until you are out of breath, concentrating on your solar plexus chakra. Adjust the vibration of the chant so you can feel it in your solar plexus chakra. 6. Repeat 5 times. 7. Now, align your solar chakra point facing up as illustrated at left, by visualizing it. The color of the solar chakra is bright yellow. 382"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"6.Opening the Sacral Chakra 1. Fold your hands. DO NOT fold your thumbs, place them side by side and keep your palms together. 2. Inhale and fill your lungs. 3. Drop your chin to your chest. 4. Contract your anus. 5. Exhale and chant I-I-N-N-N-N-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G (rhymes with the English word \"Thing.\") and concentrate on your second sacral chakra. 6. Align your chakra point facing upwards as illustrated at left. Repeat the above eight times. When you are finished, visualize yourself in an orange aura for a few minutes while focusing on feeling your sacral chakra. The \"Ing\" Rune illustrated at left, represents the creative life force ruled by this chakra. The magickal qualities of the Ing Rune are its use in sex magick and fertility. The sacral chakra is the sexual chakra. 7.Opening the Base Chakra To open the base chakra, place your hands in the position shown in the photo, like the sign of the horns. Your finger pads should be touching and your thumbs should be touching side by side down to the fleshy part known in palmistry as the \"Mount of Venus.\" This mudra produces a heat sensation in the hands and stimulates the base chakra. Don't worry if you cannot feel the heat sensation as this takes sensitivity. 383"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Breathe in and fill your lungs, but not to discomfort and with the exhale, make the s-s-s-s-s-s-s- s hissing sound. The Sigel Rune symbolizes the Satanic Lightening Bolt which is a manifestation of the kundalini serpent and also the creation; the spark of life. Kundalini is like lightening. While exhaling with the hissing sound, try to imagine/feel your base chakra as very hot and visualize it about the size of a pea, opening and expanding into a vortex. Spin this vortex. Continue visualizing your chakra lighting up into red/gold and expanding with a bright white/gold fire, about the size of a silver dollar coin in diameter and imagine the feeling of it growing hotter as it gets brighter. The hissing breath should be done seven times. Align your base chakra point facing upwards as you did with your solar and sacral chakras. 8.Opening the 8 th and 9 th Shoulder Chakras Research and revelation from Thoth has revealed the true 8th and 9th chakras are the shoulder chakras. Opening these will align the soul and drastically open energy pathways to the palm chakras, greatly empowering them. For those of you who are not Satanists- NEVER FORGET- THIS KNOWLEDGE CAME FROM THE POWERS OF HELL!! THIS KNOWLEDGE IS FROM SATAN!! To open your shoulder chakras, all you need to do is to visualize them as in the illustration at left. Focus and meditate on them for a few minutes. A feeling of aching, or pressure is a positive sign you were successful in opening them. This feeling can extend to your arms and can feel sort of like they are falling asleep. Now, align your chakras. The correct alignment of the chakras is in the shape of an equal armed cross as seen in many of the Demon Sigils. Set’s Sigil is at 384"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"left and illustrates this, as well as the three knots. Correctly aligning the chakras will drastically increase your power. 1. Begin with the base chakra and turn the cone so the point is upwards. 2. Do the same with the sacral and solar chakras (2nd and 3rd). 3. Focus your attention on your crown chakra and turn the point down. 4. Do the same with your sixth and throat chakras. 5. Now, focus on your heart chakra and visualize two points coming together and intersecting as shown in the illustration above. 6. Finish by again focusing on your shoulder chakras and visualize them pointing inward. 9.Opening the 10 th and 11 th Temple Chakras The 10th and 11th temple chakras are located right behind the temples, as shown on the left, a bit forward from the tip of the ear, and are extensions of the 6th chakra. To open these chakras, just turn your attention to each one and visualize it point facing in. Then do the same on the other side. A weird feeling of aching, heaviness, pressure, or aching is a positive sign you have correctly located and opened them. The temple chakras are extensions of the sixth chakra. 10.Opening 12 th and 13 th Hip Chakras The hip chakras are the same on each side and at the center of the hip, standing sideways, as seen at left. To open these chakras, just turn your attention to each one and visualize it point facing in. Then do the same on the other side. A weird feeling of aching, heaviness, or pressure, is a positive sign you have correctly located and opened them. The hip chakras are extensions of the base chakra, but like the shoulder chakras in proximity to the heart, they are located a bit higher. 11.Opening and Empowering the Hand Chakras 385"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"What this exercise does, when done consistently is to establish an energy circuit within the hand chakras. This energy can be used for healing, opening other chakras, applying energy or as with Dim Mak, the \"death touch.\" It also helps with telekinesis (moving objects with one's mind and pyrokinesis (setting objects on fire using the powers of the mind and aura). In order to advance with these gifts, a powerful aura is needed to act on the auras of objects. This exercise should be done at least once a day to get your energy flowing freely through your hand chakras. 1. Sit comfortably and relax. Try to go into a trance as the deeper the trance and level of concentration, the better the results, especially when beginning this exercise. After an energy current within the hand chakras is open and flowing, this can be done anywhere at will. 2. Put your hands facing each other, fingertips almost touching and relaxed. (Your fingers can be slightly bent as in the illustration). 3. With the pad of your thumb, press into the palm of each of your hands, right in the hollow part. 4. Now, focus intensly upon your hands, especially your palms. Feel the area you pressed in with your thumb. 5. Keep focusing all of your concentration and begin to feel a warm glow and energy between your palms. 6. Begin to move your hands an inch or two apart slowly and back again to where your fingertips are almost touching. Try to feel the energy between the palms of your hands. The more you practice and the stronger your energy becomes, keep moving your hands in and out, further and further apart until you can feel your energy as far apart as two or more feet. 7. Now, visualize a ball of white hot fire like the sun as in the picture above. Later on, you can use colors. Feel the heat and energy from this ball of fire between your hands. This may feel as a tingling or throbbing. For some people, it may even feel cold. The important thing is to get this energy flowing and to *feel* it. 8. Now let your arms hang down and relax. Focus on energy flowing down your arms into your hands. This may feel tingly and your lower arms and hands may feel pumped. This is a sign the enrgy is flowing. Now repeat steps 5-7 above. 9. Do the above exercise 4 times. This exercise should be done every day for as long as it takes to really open your hand chakras and establish a permanent flow of energy. With the proper practice, you should be able to feel powerful energy between your hands when your hands are more than a foot apart. 386"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":" After you have accomplished a strong energy field in your hands, practice extending this energy to your fingertips to open your fingertip chakras. 12.Opening the Feet Chakras This exercise is done standing. Relax and \"breathe\" in energy through the bottoms of your feet, mainly your heels. The feet chakras tie directly into the base chakra and sacral chakra. This may result in stimulating your sex organs as well as the feet are tied to orgasm. Continue drawing the energy up through your feet into your base chakra and up your spine and out your crown. Continue breathing the energy in for a few minutes. The feet chakras are very important for being able to draw in energy. This drawing in of energy is important for healing yourself, healing others and spellworking. 13.Opening the Sixth Chakra The third eye is an EXTENSION of the 6th chakra, which is located directly beneath the crown chakra, right in the middle of the brain. OPENING the 6th chakra [this is done the exact same way as with the third eye and should only be done after opening all of the other chakras], will help to activate the pineal 387"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"gland and much more.The third eye mudra is unnecessary. Because of the power of opening this chakra, I do not recommend to open it until you have opened all of your other chakras. Your third eye should also be all the way open, as it acts as a vent for the powerful energies of the sixth chakra. I just found this recently through my own experiences in meditation. Every book I have read [plenty] focuses on the third eye, not the 6th chakra, which is directly in back of the third eye. I have found through my own experience, the 6th chakra directly ties into the pineal gland and activates it. It seems to be much more powerful than the third eye. 1. Sit with your back straight, breathe in through your nose and on the exhale vibrate \"Thoth.\" Release your breath slowly through your mouth and vibrate: TH-TH-TH-TH-OH-OH-OH-TH-TH-TH in one long exhale (vibrate the sound one time per exhale, as with the Yogic \"humming breath\") and try to concentrate the vibration on your 6th chakra. Now this is important. Keep the TH and OH sounding at the same time. You should be making the TH sound all throughout the exhale. Your tongue will be vibrating between your teeth. It may take a few seconds to adjust this to where you feel it in your 6th chakra, don’t worry, just keep on going. Try to get it to the correct vibration where you can feel it in the middle of your brain. This can take some experimenting. Just do the best you can. You may have to try as many as ten to fifteen times or more to get it right. 2. Do the above 4 times in a row and then relax. 3. Now, align your sixth chakra correctly by visualizing it point end facing down as illustrated at left. The color of the sixth chakra is bluish-violet. 4. It is very important the above exercise be done for FOUR consecutive days, preferably 24 hours apart. 14.Opening the Minor Chakras To open the minor chakras, it is important that you have already opened the major chakras and have an energy flow to where you can feel it. To open your minor chakras, just direct and focus your energy into them and visualize them lighting up with the enery. Ideally, you should be able to feel them. 388"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"389"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"390"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"391"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"Correctly Aligning the Chakras I want to make something very clear here. For any non-Satanists who visit this page, whether you are so-called \"New Age\" \"Mystics\" or whatever, if you proceed to read on, NEVER FORGET- THIS KNOWLEDGE CAME FROM SATAN AND THE EGYPTIAN GOD, THOTH. Thoth is with the Powers of Hell. I do not have the time to go into a long spiel here. The cross has been hideously corrupted by xianity. The true cross is equal armed, and represents the four corners and directions, such as when we summon the Four Crowned Princes of Hell during ritual. The cross is a concept and is equal armed, as seen in many of the Demons' Sigils, the Nazi Iron Cross, and the bikers cross. This is the correct alignment of the chakras on the inside. If you stand facing a mirror, this is the way your chakras should line up. The reason for this, is that the energy uptake of each chakra is at the base and the energy output is at the point. So it would stand to reason that the chakras such as the third eye (DO NOT confuse this with the sixth chakra, which is BEHIND the third eye) need to have their bases facing outwards to absorb energy. The Chakras on the inside, in the middle all align to the heart chakra, which, like the organ the heart, which it controls, circulates the energy of the soul. This definitely includes all of the minor chakras. You will find that after aligning your chakras correctly, you will feel more centered and healing and spellworking will come more easily. Now, when directing energy as you would for spellwork, so to speak, the chakras can be temporarily reversed so their points are facing out to deliver the energy. Remember, never connect with any negative energy, such as when working black magick. In other words, the negative energy should never run through you, but be external at all times. When working with positive energy, such as attracting your desires, it is favorable to point the chakras out and connect. Always remember to correctly realign your chakras after any work. Incorrect alignment of the chakras reduces your witchpower and can bring about diseases and illnesses. 392"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Research and revelation from Thoth has revealed the true 8th and 9th chakras are the shoulder chakras.

I also believe this was the message of the three pyramids at Giza, Egypt, as they are shaped as the chakras. Astaroth's Sigil at right illustrates this concept with the bars on each side. The hip chakras are the same on each side and at the center of the hip, standing sideways, as seen at left. The temple chakras are located right behind the temples, as shown on the left, a bit forward from the tip of the ear.

This is a positive indicator that they have been correctly located and activated. 394"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Energy Meditation This meditation is excellent for beginners as it helps to give one a feel for energy. This meditation also strengthens the aura when done regularly. 1. Begin by relaxing your entire body. The deeper the trance, the more effective, but this meditation can be done at any time and a trance is not necessary. 2. Breath in and at the same time, draw in energy from all sides of your body, front, back, top of your head and bottom of your feet. For beginners, you should visualize white brilliant light, like the sun. Working with colors is more advanced and most effective when you are a bit more experienced. 3. Exhale and visualize the energy expanding your aura 4. Breathe in again and visualize the energy getting brighter and more powerful, radiating from your entire being. 5. Exhale again and visualize the energy expanding your aura, and the center of your body shining brilliantly like the sun. 6. Repeat this several times, each time visualizing the energy becomeing brighter and brighter as it increases in intensity. When working with colors, visualize the color becoming more and more powerful and vibrant. You will notice each color has a different feel to it. Colors can be used to attract according to their nature. You can also breathe in energy from the front and back sides of your body at the same time to meet in the middle, then do the sides and top and bottom. After this, let your aura expand outwards. With this meditation, you can also practice expanding and contracting your aura. 395"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"How to Clean Your Aura Cleaning your aura is essential for spiritual hygiene. By cleaning your aura on a daily basis, you protect yourself against psychic attacks and illnesses. A clean aura is charismatic and will encourage better relations with others. People will naturally be more considerate and grant favors to one whose aura is clean and radiating with energy. Here is where we influence people and get them to do as we wish. Negative thoughtforms used in black magick and generated from the ill will, jealousy or anger of others attach to one’s aura and invite misfortune- accidents, illnesses and so forth. Cleaning the aura only takes a few minutes a day and is well worth it. When one is ill, depressed the aura is dirty and can take many meditations to clean. What is within reflects in one’s aura. Contrary to many teachings, Satan/Lucifer is the bringer of light. Since the Demons have been liberated, their auras have drastically increased in light. Their power has increased as well. In some of the old grimiores, certain Demons have related their hopes to “return to the light.” Those of us who have been working with them understand what they meant by this statement. The light is in the aura. The soul needs light in order to have power. Father Satan levitated in front of me one time. When he did so, his aura became extremely brilliant in light. Ideally, one should clean the aura twice a day- upon awaking and before falling asleep at night. Cleaning your aura before you go to sleep is essential. The more people you come into contact with throughout the day, the more thoughtforms and energy will attach to your astral body and result in problems. People’s astral bodies intermingle on a daily basis. Like viruses and physical germs, the astral body picks up energy. To clean your aura: 1. Visualize a bright light all over yourself. Hold this for One or more minutes. It doesn’t take very long. 2. Now, visualize the light even brighter and more intensified on each of your chakras, like a miniature sun. That’s all there is to it. If you notice your aura or chakras are dirty, repeat the process. This exercise can alert you to any negative energy or psychic attacks and prevent them from manifesting. 396"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Satanic Void Meditation \"Void Meditation\" is what is known as \"stilling the mind.\" The benefits of void meditation are the ability to turn off unwanted thoughts and influences at will, being able to control your thoughts instead of your thoughts controlling you (as with the average person), and a sense of inner peace. Void meditation is essential for anyone who practices power meditation, and is important for success in advanced magickal practice. Power meditation changes the strength of our thoughts and it is very important to be able to control thoughts and to turn them off or focus them at will. Thought power, also known as 'witch power' is needed for success in ritual and in using your mind to obtain what you want. Power meditation, strengthens our thoughts, and people who are more aware or sensitive will be able to pick up on our thoughts and feelings telepathically. Void meditation will train your mind to be silent so others will not know what you are thinking. The Japanese Ninja use this technique to avoid being detected while carrying out important missions that require one to advance or infiltrate, unnoticed. Void meditation trains your mind so you can focus during rituals and in every day life so your mind brings you what you desire. There are several techniques for void meditation. The goal is to turn off all of your thoughts and focus on the here and now. You get your mind to be completely still for a specified length of time. In the beginning, this can be extremely difficult, as thoughts will come into your head continually. Before you know it, you will again be thinking about something. Don't get upset with yourself as this is very normal and even for advanced practitioners, certain meditation sessions may not go as smooth as usual. Just keep bringing your mind back to focus. Patience and persistence are the keys here. It definitely helps to do some breathing exercises beforehand to induce a trance state. Some people find meditating after a heavy meal causes the mind to be easily distracted. Always try to meditate when you are fully awake and alert. If you try to do void meditation when you are tired, chances are you will quickly fall asleep. 1. Breathing exercises are optional. This is a simple method of breathing that will induce a trance state: • Breathe in for a count of six,* • Hold your breath for a count of six • Exhale for a count of six Repeat this several times until you feel relaxed. * Only hold as long as you feel comfortable. If holding for a count of six is not comfortable, then hold for a count of 4, or even 2. Just make sure you are uniform in your counts. Never hold longer than is comfortable. Breathing exercises are never to be pushed, as in doing so, they can cause damage to the nervous system. 2. Now, get your entire mind to be completely still and free of any thoughts for a specified amount of time with no thoughts or music in your head. Your mind should be a total blank. You should focus on being in the here and now. For beginners, five minutes is fine. Intermediate and advanced practitioners can go anywhere from 15 minutes to however long they feel is essential. Void meditation can be done with your eyes open or closed. When your eyes are open, you will more than likely see a mist around objects as you settle into a trance state. This is normal. If you choose to close your eyes, you may fall asleep, but this is an individual choice and use whatever method works best. 397"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"For meditation with your eyes open: Choose something small to focus on. This can be a point on the wall, a second hand on a clock, or even a piece of lint on your clothing. Many choose to meditate on a candle flame. The important thing is to concentrate on your object of choice For meditation with your eyes closed: Focus inside of yourself and relax. You can put yourself deeper and deeper into a trance with a feeling of falling. This is normal. For people who are new, this falling sensation that often accompanies a deep trance can make you feel dizzy. To stop the sensation, focus on the front of your body. Everyday void meditation: Void meditation can be done anywhere and at any time with just focusing on the here and now and concentrating totally on whatever you are doing. This method works best for those of you who are unable to secure any privacy. Just set a goal to focus on the here and now for a specific amount of time each day and you will benefit. Advanced Void Meditation: • Visualize an object and hold the image in your mind. At first, it will fade in and out, but as you progress, it will remain longer and longer. This is definitely a needed ability for magickal practice and focusing your mind power. • Focus on a specific chant or sound. You can do this either aloud or in your head. This is what is known as a \"mantra.\" You breathe in and on the exhale, chant a specific mantra or tone of your choice. One common chant used in kundalini yoga is \"Sa Ta Na Ma.\" This is pronounced \"Sah- Tah- Nah- Mah.\" You can also chant \"Sa Tan\" \"Say-Tahn\" or \"Say- Tahn- Nah- S-S-S-S.\" • Focus on a specific emotion- anger, happiness, sadness, love, hate. You can choose an emotion going by how you feel on a specific day. This is excellent training for advanced ritual. • Focus on a specific texture, for example, running your fingers back and forth across velvet or a terry towel. • Focus on a specific odor or taste. Advanced void meditation that includes adding physical positions trains both your mind and develops an iron will, and extreme inner strength. 1. Keep your entire body still. Do NOT move. This is what the advanced yogis do. Get into a comfortable position. Don't scratch any itches, just ignore them and stay focused. Muscle cramps may come and go. Ignore any physical fatigue or mental fatigue. Just continue to remain focused. 2. Add uncomfortable and/or awkward positions. Make sure these are taken from a Yoga or Tai Chi book, so that they are physically beneficial. This is a discipline that is taught in many Martial Arts 398"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"schools where one learns to ignore pain, while retaining intense focus. This strengthens the mind for physical combat and drastically increases your sense of self-confidence. This will also increase your resistance to pain. Many martial arts masters meditate under cold waterfalls, in snow or other painful conditions. One's physical health must be built up here, for obvious reasons. A cold shower can be substituted. As with anything new, be sure to start out gradual. These techniques, when mastered, will give one total control over one's mind and emotions. If one faces death, one will not freeze up or panic with fear and the odds of one's survival will greatly increase. 3. Running and meditating; focusing on your running steps, increases endurance both mentally and physically. Power Void Meditation: This is an excellent way to empower yourself while doing void meditation. This is advanced and you must have a feel for energy and be able to draw it in as with the Energy Meditation. Here you don't visualize the energy, you just breathe in and out, absorbing the energy on the inhale and expanding your aura on the exhale. You focus totally on the *feel.* You should be adept at energy breathing before incorporating this method into your void meditation. 399"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"EZ Chakra Spin This meditation only takes a few minutes or less and can be done at any time when you can tune in and focus. It is easy to do and can take the place of a full or extended meditation for people who lack the necessary privacy and/or are short on time. Turn your attention to the base of your spine and visualize your base chakra as a vortex (like a small tornado). Color the energy a rich vibrant red and spin it. Keep spinning it until it spins fast and on its own. Work your way up through each chakra, visualizing each one and spinning it until it spins fast and on its own. Visualize each one as a spinning vortex with a powerful vibrant color- • 1st- red • 2nd- orange • 3rd- yellow • 4th- green • 5th- rich sky blue • 6th- indigo (Bluish-violet) • 7th- purple When you spin the 6th chakra, focus *behind* your 3rd eye, in the middle of your head. Many people erroneously believe the third eye to be the 6th chakra. The 3rd eye is an *extension* of the 6th chakra; not the 6th chakra. Each of your chakras should be a powerful vibrant color. Chakras that are dark or tainted are not functioning properly. Keep spinning them and focus your visualization to restore them to their own powerful color. You might also want to clean them if this is the case. When our chakras spin at a faster rate, this helps to protect us from misfortune and disease. It also opens us to the astral and protects us astrally as well as in the physical world. Remember, though, energy work must be done every day as each day builds on the day before and until a strong energy field is permanently established, short term benefits can be lost or harder to restore. Also, note that the soul is made of light. Each of the chakras is a wavelength of light frequency, as can be seen in a light prism, when the light of the sun is broken into the spectrum of visible colors. This is in physics. All of the so-called \"occult\" can be scientifically explained. When we breathe in or invoke light energy, we are empowering our soul. 400"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Full Chakra Meditation To amplify the powers of your chakras to their full potential, it is important to meditate upon the chakra at the day and hour when it is at its full power.

The more powerful your chakras, the more powerful your magick. Research has proven that the Ancient Chaldean planetary hours are extremely accurate. I strongly encourage you to download the Chronos program from this website: CLICK HERE You will need to download and install version 2.0 of the Microsoft .NET Framework along with this. All of the information is available at the above website. This program is outstanding and calculates hours of the planets specific to your location. I have found from my own experiences through years of meditation, some meditations are very powerful and other times- little or nothing. The same goes for spellworking. This has to do with the alignment of the planets and timing. Each chakra is ruled and influenced by a specific planet. When meditating upon a specific chakra, if you do this on the day and the hour of the planet corresponding to the chakra, the effects will be 100% amplified. This also includes spellworking and the planet that rules over the working, such as Venus for love, Mars for athletics or rage, etc. For example, meditating upon money when Saturn (limitations, hardships, and loss) is strong, is a total waste of time and rarely will the working produce any tangible results. The Vibrations for each chakra below are based upon the 1586 Necronomicon. I have found these vibrations to be legitimate words of power. In the grimoires, the code-words for chakra/s is God/s. The exact vibrations practiced in Ancient Egypt at this point are not known, but we are researching this. \"The subject is naturally one of the most obscure that is known to scholarship, and so far no one has thrown any real light on it. That, however, there was once in Egypt and Chaldeæ a science of this \"nature language,\" or \"tongue of the gods,\" \"In Egypt the priests hymn the Gods by means of the seven vowels, chanting them in order; instead of the pipe and lute the musical chanting of these letters is heard. In speaking of the vowels or \"sounding letters \" - each of the seven spheres being said to give forth a different vowel or nature-tone - Nicomachus informs us that these root-sounds in nature are combined with certain material elements, as they are in spoken speech with the {14} consonants; but \" just as the soul with the body, and music with the lyre- strings, the one produces living creatures and the other musical modes and tunes, so do those root-sounds give birth to certain energic and initiatory powers of divine operations.\" - From A Mithraic Ritual The Complete Chakra Meditation is extremely powerful.

At first, there is usually just blackness depending on how active your 3rd eye is, then possibly swirling colors and shapes.

Any sounds can be used for this meditation. This includes any kind of music. Close your eyes and relax. Open your mind and try to 'see' the sounds. Sounds usually come in motion and in specific shapes, colors and waves. The ability to see sounds is called “synesthesia.” “Synesthesia” is a medical term for those of us who are born with the ability to see sounds and/or experience different senses at the same time, like hearing colors or tasting/smelling shapes. A small percentage of the population were born with synesthesia. It often fades with age and in most cases is pronounced during childhood. The experience of seeing sounds and crossing the senses is common with the use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, though drug use induces synesthesia through artificial means and it cannot be controlled. With drugs, the user is not in control, the drug is, and in self-empowerment and magickal practice, it is extremely important for the practitioner to always be in control through his/her own natural ability. Dependence on powerful mind altering substances creates weakness of character and also creates holes in the aura and a weakening of the astral body. I am not talking recreational marijuana use here, I am referring to dependence on powerful chemicals in order to reach an altered state as some mages have been known to do. Synesthetic people are often very psychic and highly intelligent according to medical studies. CIA and U.S. Military psychics reported going through stages of synesthesia when performing extensive exercises to open their minds for psychic warfare. Synesthesia may happen with your first sound meditation or with practice. Close your eyes and note the colors, shapes and movements of the sounds. You should write this in your Book of Shadows/Black Book/journal if you keep one. You should put aside all thoughts and visions as you would for void meditation and try to “see” the sound(s)/music. In time, other senses can also come into play- what does it taste like? Smell like? The most common experience is to see the sounds, but don’t put any limitations on yourself. Natural synesthesia facilitates clairvoyance, clairaudience and other psychic abilities. Synesthesia can be a very beautiful experience and a rewarding session of meditation. The more pathways we open and empower in our brains, the more experiences and abilities we are able to have. We are no longer just using “5-10%” of our brains. To fully develop this ability, one should listen to a variety of music and also each day, take time out to listen and “see” the sounds in one’s environment. Like anything else, the more we use this ability, the stronger it becomes. 412"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Directing Energy To make full use of your abilities in magick, it is important to be familiar with energy; sensing it, how to absorb it, detect it, send it out and manipulate it.

Feel energy from the front of your body, then the back, repeating the same steps as described above. 6. Do this again, this time from the waist up, then from the waist down. Same as above. 7. Now, feel the energy in your entire body as a whole. Practice expanding and contracting your aura several times. 8. The last time, bring the energy together in the center of your body and gently expand it out, expanding your aura, making sure it feels balanced and even. 9. Meditate on feeling the energy gently radiating and expanding your aura for a few minutes. It is very important to always direct your energy upwards and out of your crown chakra. There will be times you will feel it drifting to your legs and feet. It should not remain there for any length of time as it can create problems because of a lack of circulation. 413"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Controlling Your Chakras This exercise is important, and very useful for shutting out unwanted stimuli. Upon closing your chakras, you will feel a sense of calm and inner peace. Closing your chakras will also protect you from both unwanted humans and astral entities as both attach themselves at the chakras, and by closing your chakras around threatening beings, you can prevent this. Closed chakras also protect you from psychic vampirism. This exercise can also help to still the mind when done before void meditation as it shuts out a lot of psychic noise. 1. At the end of your meditations, sit comfortably or stand up (whichever you prefer) and begin at the base chakra. 2. See your base chakra as a whirling red vortex of energy. Visualize either doors or shuttered doors and close them on the chakra, shutting out all of the light. 3. Continue this all the way up with each individual chakra, to the crown. You should feel a sense of peace and quiet, when all of your chakras are closed. This exercise can be done several times a day if you wish to block out unwanted external stimuli and/or to protect yourself in a negative environment like around xians or other undesirables. This is especially effective for people who are natural mediums and easily absorb energy and for those who are easily distracted. Your chakras will open back up on their own after a bit. If you feel you need to open them right away, just reverse the above exercise and open the doors and spin each chakra several times. 414"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Meditation for Past Life Regrssion This exercise requires deep relaxation. Lie down in a comfortable position. You should begin by breathing in to a count of six, Hold for a count of six And exhale for a count of six. Do this several times until you feel completely relaxed and you can no longer feel your body. Turn your attention inside and to your entire back side and free fall. Just let go and a falling sensation should manifest. For inexperienced meditators, this might make you dizzy. If you feel real uncomfortable or dizzy, just focus on the front of your body to stop the free fall. The deeper you free fall, the deeper your trance state and the easier it is to work with your mind. When you have reached a deep trance state, visualize yourself walking towards a door in your mind. As you walk towards the door, tell yourself when you walk through the door, you will enter into your past life. This should be the life that preceded your life now. Walk through the door, look around at your environment. To go back several lifetimes, just visualize the door and tell yourself you are going back to whatever year you wish to regress to. To go forward in any past life, will yourself forward by asking your mind to take you to a specific stage of your life or year. Take the time to look around and ask your mind questions. To regress further through each past life, will yourself backwards by telling your mind to take you back further until you can regress no more, and again, walk through another door, telling yourself you are entering the lifetime before this life you are observing. You will be further back in time. To go foreword into your next life- use the same technique, only be aware this is only one of many possible futures. To bring yourself out, walk back through the door into now. 415"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Flame Meditation Method One: 1. Light a candle and stare at the flame for 2 minutes. Make sure your attention does not wander. 2. Close your eyes and place your hands in relaxed cupped position, palms over your eyes and concentrate on the imprint of the flame in the darkness. The image will tend to move across your area of vision. Keep looking for it and bring it back and keep concentrating on it for four mintues. 3. Relax and empty your thoughts and tune into your breathing for a few minutes, concentrating only on each breath What this exercise does: This exercise prepares the mind for one-pointed concentration, which is so important to any psychic/astral workings. With the average person, thoughts are scattered and dissipate into nothing. With the trained mind that can concentrate intensely, the thoughts are single-pointed and focused like a laser and have power. 100% concentration makes the difference in astral workings. One's will is also developed with this exercise as a powerful will does not give into distraction. Do not become frustrated or impatient with yourself. It is normal for thoughts to creep in to distract you in the beginning. Total concentration takes time and is one of the most difficult aspects of training the mind. Method Two (intermediate): 1. Focus on the flame for several minutes 2. Close your eyes and place your hands in relaxed cupped position, palms over your eyes and concentrate on the imprint of the flame in the darkness. The image will tend to move across your area of vision. 3. Keeping your eyes closed, try to enter the imprint. You will find the imprint begins to compact and change color. The bright image will change to pink, then to red and grow dark. 4. Repeat the exercise if you wish. What this exercise does: This exercise trains the mind and third eye to direct psychic energy. 416"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Physical Yoga Physical yoga, along with Tai Chi can greatly amplify power. Below is a basic session you can do every day. It is important to never force yourself in any of the stretches. Yoga is very different from athletic stretching. It should be done in a relaxed state and never forced. It is right-brained and the goal is to empower ourselves. Anyone can learn on physical yoga their own, contrary to the popular notion of having a teacher. I taught myself from Richard Hittlemen's book \"Yoga 28 Day Exercise Plan\" when I was 13. The most important thing in yoga is to go by *feel.* Physical yoga should also be done while in a meditative state, for maximum power. If you feel a sense of lightness, increased bioelectricity and power, you are preforming the asanas correctly. Yoga is also best done alone, as others or a class can be a distraction. Yoga should be done in a sequence- either standing to sitting to lying to inverted OR inverted to lying to sitting to standing. Each asana should be held for one minute, or with more difficult asanas, hold for a count of 10, 20 or 30 and do them twice or three times. Go as to how you feel. As you progress, you can hold for longer periods. Some adepts hold the handstand and other asanas for 10 minutes or more. Remember, we are all individuals. For timing yourself, for example when holding a minute, just count to 60, like \"one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four... You should relax and remain perfectly still when in each asana. Never jerk, tug, strain or pull and remember- only go as far as you are comfortable. The sequence given below should be done in order. Yoga is meant to be peaceful and relaxing. TV, loud music blasting and commotion are not in harmony with yoga. *Inverted asanas should not be attempted by those who have brain problems, detached retina, cervical problems, who are very overweight or have any condition that could be aggravated by increased pressure or blood flow to the head and neck. You can do the other asanas and leave the inverted ones out. Only go as far as you can and never strain. YOGA IS *NOT* ATHLETICS! ALWAYS compliment a front bend with a back bend. There always has to be an opposite move in yoga. If you twist to the left side, you must also twist to the right side. Every yoga program should include: • Standing asanas • Sitting asanas • Forward bending asanas • Backward bending asanas • Side to side bending asanas • Twisting asanas • Inverted asanas (these can be left out for those who have medical problems as I mentioned in the above). • Lying asanas 417"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Handstand When I first learned to perform a handstand- I was very young and of course, it was easy being a kid. I just kicked up to the wall. Anyone at any age who is in decent health and weight can learn to do a handstand. Later on, you can try walking your hands away from the wall further and further. Only hold the handstand as long as comfortable, but try to add a few counts each week. I prefer to do a handstand, instead of a headstand as the handstand places less pressure on the neck vertebrate, it strengthens the arms and wrists and is over all much more effective. It can be done and held against a wall for support, until you can do it away from the wall.

It is simple and the more you do this, the more powerful the protective aura becomes. 1. Breathe in white-gold energy* as you would with the energy foundation meditation. You don't need to go into a deep trance with this. Just concentrate on *feeling* the energy enter your being on each inhale and then visualize a powerful brilliant light, like the Sun becoming brighter and brighter with each exhalation. Once you get this going, it becomes very easy and takes little time. 2. Affirm: \"I am breathing in powerful protective energy. This energy is building an aura of protection around me. This aura protects me at all times in every way.\" Say this to yourself five times for five inhales. After this, just concentrate on visualizing and feeling the energy, making it more and more brighter and powerful. This will program the energy and also program your aura. After several days of doing this exercise, you can say the affirmation once or twice, instead of five, as it will already be programmed into your aura. The more you do this, you will build a more and more powerful protective aura. Use the energy from the Sun as well. Energy from the Sun is extremely powerful. When doing this, just add \"I am breathing in powerful protective energy from the sun. This energy is building an aura of protection around me. This aura protects me at all times in every way.\" *White-gold energy is used because it is reflective. You can also program your aura so you breathe in protective energy from the Sun (extremely powerful) when you are outside. After the first few times, you don't even have to visualize anything. You can just feel this and you don't have to be in a trance for it to work- you will feel it. I am to where I just consciously breathe in energy and I can do it easily at any time- with no trance or visualization. Another important thing you can do to protect yourself and remain safe is to affirm 5-10 times before you go to sleep: \"I am always totally safe and protected in every way.\" Never doubt this! The aura of protection will also help to clean your aura and repel any negative energy. This is very important. You can also visualize loved ones and breathe energy into their aura to protect them. Just go into a trance and visualize whoever you want to protect and breathe in energy as outlined in the link above and then breathe it out into the aura of the one you wish to protect and follow the same procedure, only apply it to this other person. This can also be done for healing purposes. 419"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Intermediate Meditations Azazel's Four Dimensional MerKaBa Meditation Azazel and Thoth worked with me to revise this meditation which was based on the \"Mer Ka Ba.\" Further revisions were dictated to me from Azazel (3/26,27/05). There are many new age authors who write about and teach the Mer Ka Ba. The new age version is based upon a hexagram. The hexagram version was given to new age enthusiasts by angels. What the hexagram does is it establishes a geometric energy field that corresponds to the planet Saturn, of time; the lower octave of Saturn. The current system of time, based on the number 3 and 6, is out of sync with the vibrations of the earth and the universe, which are naturally 13 and 20; the 13 lunar months. Unbeknownst to many, the hexagram meditation is a conspiracy and is to the detriment of humanity. It has to do with the numbers and this is very complex. I will write a seperate article concerning this and linear time. The meditation give on this website is based on the eight pointed Star of Isis (Astaroth). The correct position of for the Star of Isis is rotated at 22 degrees. Shown at left, in its upright position, it is known as the \"Sigil of the Beast 666.\"¹ The Silver Star of Isis (turned at 22 degrees) is also said to have been worn by the Knights Templar on a red sash. The numbers are definitely Satanic as the number of Isis (Astaroth) is 8 and the number of the pentagram is 5; 8 + 5 = 13. Enki's number is 40; another combination is 5 x 8 = 40. 13 is also based upon the thirteen Lunar Months which is the natural year and the eight phases of the moon. It is also based upon the Satanic Year. Her Babylonian symbol is known as the \"Star Disc of Ishtar.\" What this meditation can do is take your energy field to a much higher vibration. The geometry of energy has powerful effects. Once this meditation has begun, you should continue to do it every day until the spinning fields are permanent. You will know they are permanent when you can feel the pulsating senstion any time you focus your attention on them. Once they are permanent, you will no longer have to perform the meditation every single day. The eight pointed star is very ancient and based upon the octahedron. The octrahedron is an extremely important aspect of nature and is one of the primary archetypes of creation for all life. It is based on 13 circles of which the centers connect. It is also the basis of important informational systems in the universe. Within it are found all five of the Platonic Solids, the ”building blocks” of creation. The eight pointed star is also the symbol for the \"Shambhala initiation;\" the initiation of advanced Buddhist monks into the Kalachakra Tradition. This tradition preceded what most people know as Buddhism by thousands of years and is based upon the Tibetan \"Bon\" religion, which was given to the Tibetan Priesthood from Marduk/Amon Ra.

I have been studying this aspect of magick in depth and working with the runes and have found them to be exceptionally powerful. I am still studying and will reveal more information as I go along. Cutting through the Bullshit In studying the history of many the different known manuscripts of occult disciplines and grimoires, one will find that nearly all, if not all have been drastically altered. It appears that with every important manuscript, a Jew had to have a hand in either \"deciphering\" \"translating\" or just \"helping\" to put it together. For so small a number of the population, it seems this people are always relentlessly working to have control at key points. The result is the desecration of Gentile spiritual texts in order to remove magickal knowledge and strip the Gentiles of all occult powers. We can read more of this by clicking here: The Stolen Kaballah THE ULTIMATE JEWISH MASTERPIECE IS THE BIBLE AND THE ULTIMATE JEWISH CREATION IS THE NAZARENE CHARACTER. The runes seem to have been an extreme threat to the Catholic Church as the penalty for using runes or even having knowledge of them was death. The Jewish tool of xianity hunted down and mass murdered Druid Priests, religious leaders and many other Gentile Pagan Mages to near extinction. Because of this, what is available regarding runic magick in the mainstream bookstores is flawed. For example, the most important pronunciation of the runes is usually given in American English. This flaw is glaringly apparent. The runes are Germanic and Norse in origin, so why would we want to vibrate them using American English?? By the way, vibrating the runes is the most powerful and is the foundation of the True Runic Kabalah. It is obvious with the information readily available out there, that the Germanic umlauts have been omitted, along with many other guttural pronunciations, which are extremely important to correctly using the runes. When deep in meditation and vibrating a certain rune some time ago, Satan came to me and told me to \"roll the R's fully.\" This takes practice for those who do not have this in their native language, but comes in time and when one has mastered the correct vibrations, one will find the results of one's efforts in applying magick quickly forthcoming. How accurately and smoothly one performs the vibration for the specified number of times corresponding to the rune will determine the power and success of the working. Unbeknownst to many, there is a Gothic Kabalah, a Phoenician Kabalah and Greek Kabalah among others. The Kabalah is originally Egyptian in origin. The originally Egyptian phrase: \"In the Beginning was the word\" was stolen from Ancient Egypt(Phony Jewish Yaweh replaces the Egyptian God Ptah), Reference: 101 Myths of the Bible by Gary Greenburg © 2000 pages 11-13. The entire universe vibrates and through vibration we greatly empower our soul and amplify our magick. The original alphabet is based upon the constellations. Like everything else, the Jews have tried to claim \"Hebrew was the original language and alphabet\" but this is NOT SO. With the necessary research using reliable secular sources and texts, one will find \"Hebrew\" was taken from Phoenician and other languages predating it. It also appears that Hebrew was taken from Hindi in that the letters 432"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"have similarities and many of their words have their origins in Hindi. For anyone with any knowledge, we all know the bible was written to give the Jews a history and status they never had nor are they entitled to. The runes can be traced back to Ancient Phoenician and cuneiform scripts. This is their power. Many of the correct pronunciations have unfortunately been lost due to the systematic destruction of spiritual knowledge and its replacement with Hebrew Bullshit. Using the Runes The Kabalah is actually pretty straightforward when stripped of all the meaningless Jewish bullshit and alterations. Kabalistic magick is based upon letters and numbers, in that each letter corresponds with a number. The name of the letter is vibrated with a specific focus on a chakra of choice, an aspect of the soul, the aura, a body organ (for empowering and/or healing). The basis of this is the yogic \"humming breath.\" Example One: Healing Meditation- 1. Go into a trance and breathe in energy into the specific organ that needs healing. Visualize this as white-gold like the sun. 2. State your affirmation such as \"I am breathing in powerful healing energy that is ridding my _____ of disease permanently, and making it strong, healthy and normal in every way. State this several times in your mind with intent with each breath. 3. Now breathe in the energy and on the exhale, vibrate the name of the rune you wish to use. Say you are using the \"Uruz\" rune, you would inhale the energy and ON THE EXHALE, FOCUS THE VIBRATION SO YOU CAN DIRECTLY *FEEL* IT VIBRATING IN THE ORGAN: OOOOOOO- RRRRR(roll the R)-OOOOOOO-ZZZZZZZZZ. 4. The number for Uruz is two, so you would want to vibrate this rune for a number corresponding to two, such as twenty times for each session. During the meditation, visualize the Uruz rune as you can. In time, when you open your mind, this can all be simultaneously. The rune should be shining with power. Example Two: Empowering a chakra- Say for example you want to empower your heart chakra, the Gebo rune rules this chakra. 1. Go into a trance and breathe in energy into your heart chakra. Visualize this as white-gold like the sun, as the sun is the esoteric ruler of the heart chakra and the center of power of the soul. 2. Vibrate the Gebo Rune and FEEL it vibrating right in your heart chakra: GGGGGG-(this is guttural and the sound is prolonged in the back of the throat, creating a powerful energy circuit)- AAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY-BBBBBBBBBBB (this again is vibrated on the lips)OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH.

Satanic Rosary 446"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"The Satanic Rosary is an excellent and very effective means to raise power and apply energy towards your desires. The Satanic Rosary can also be used as a kabalistic meditation tool for working with vibrations, such as with Runic meditation. Just slide your fingers over the beads and you don't have to count. Your meditation can flow smoothly and thus have more power. The Catholic Rosary was STOLEN from Tibetan Mala Beads and corrupted, as with everything else in that foul program. Tibetan Mala beads have 108 beads, as opposed to the stolen Catholic Rosary, which has half that number, at 54. For working the rosary, each working should begin on a favorable planetary period in regards to the goal. The standard for this and this is very effective is 40 days straight. For maximum power, twice a day, during the day and at night for the 40 days. The \"40 days\" was stolen and corrupted into that filthy judeo/xian bible, but originated in Ancient Egypt. This has to do with numbers (Enki/Satan's number is 40) and the moon cycle. The most powerful times to do a working ar at midnight, 12 noon, 6 pm and 6 am, BUT make sure the hour is supportive of the working, first and foremost as you are able to. Research has proven that the Ancient Chaldean planetary hours are extremely accurate. I strongly encourage you to download the Chronos program from this website: CLICK HERE You will need to download and install version 2.0 of the Microsoft .NET Framework along with this. All of the information is available at the above website. This program is outstanding and calculates hours of the planets specific to your location. Given the results of your workig, if you still have not obtained your goal after completing the 40 days, you can begin another 40 days. Skipping a day will set you back at day one. No days can be skipped. There is this thing called \"karma\" as most of you know. This shit is ruled by the planet Saturn and the only way to defeat it is to know it and work to overcome 447"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"it. Karma will give you a beat down and keep you beat down unless you are aware of it and are strong and persistent enough to fight against it and overcome it. This is not for the weak. Persistance, patience and hard work are required here. When past life karma kicks in, things will come up like a crisis in your life to try to break the 40 day cycle and to stop you from your meditations. What this indicates is that your meditations are working. Keep doing your daily meditation with the rosary regardless of what happens. These sorts of things usually crop up during the last 30-40 days of the meditation cycle, to try to set you at square one again and/or stop the meditation. Be prepared and aware. One must keep fighting. Only the strong survive here and attain their goals. Energy must be applied over and over again until change is achieved. This is analagous to a chiropractor who keeps popping the spine into place until it stays where it should be. For healing, it is important when there are chronic ailments to go way beyond the end of the symptoms, in meditating. The symptoms may stop for a time and then return if meditation is stopped. The length of time one has endured the ailment means longer times for meditations, sometimes even for months or years. Congential problems are the worst and the most difficult to heal. these are by no means impossible. They just will require much more power and effort. By using the Satanic Rosary, we are taking back what is ours for one, and another- blaspheming the Catholic Church. I have found this meditation tool to be excellent and that is an understatement. The vibrations flow into a rhythm and power is amplified and can be applied towards any desire. To use the Satanic Rosary, ideally, you should be working with the Kabalah. The TRUE Kabalah is using vibration, for example vibrating Runes, names of Demons, Egyptian words of power, etc., to drastrically raise your energy and power. This form of meditation is advanced and is extremely effective. You can just do the vibrations for raising energy and awareness, or you can focus on a specific chakra or aspect of your soul, or you can do spell-working. I suggest you make your own Satanic Rosary. They are easy to make. The materials are cheaply available in most stores where they have an arts and crafts section. Just purchase the beads and the cord. The Baphomet can be purchased online or at any well-stocked occult shop. I suggest leaving a bit of space on the cord, so you can slide the beads along as you do your vibration for each one. I also suggest you place an extra bead (I used square shaped beads for the extra beads) on each side of the larger one when you hit 50. That way you can feel where you are at without interrupting your trance/meditation. To use the Satanic Rosary, here is an example- feel free to modify your own meditation to fit your individual purposes: FOR ATTRACTING MONEY: 1. Begin with the larger bead right next to the Baphomet and state your affirmation in your mind; example: \"I am attracting large amounts of free and easy money. This money is free and all mine to keep or spend as I please.\" Now, direct the energy, visualizing a white/gold light (this is all-purpose) on your wallet and yourself. 2. Repeat the above for the four remaining beads. 3. Your Satanic Rosary should have 108 beads, so one side of the main line should end with eight. You want to start with the side that has nine.

(If you are vibrating the name of a Demon, then visualize His/Her Sigil in the same way. 6. When you reach the larger 10th bead, separating the sets of the smaller 9 beads, state your affirmation again and put your energy you have just raised into attracing money, as given in the example above. You can also use each 10th bead to take a few normal breaths before returning to the vibrations again. FOR LOVE/LUST: To bring a desired one into your life, visualize the energy you raise engulfing him/her. You can also fantasize having sexual intercourse or whatever with the one of your desire. I suggest you visualize the light (energy) engulfing both of you, during the meditation/fantasy. When you are finished, you can masturbate and direct more energy from the orgasm into him/her. TO HEAL: State the affirmation for healing and then direct the energy both by feel and visualization into the afflicted part of your body. If healing a loved one, do the visualization and don't forget to clean the afflicted part before beginning the meditation. Remember, with healing, energy must be directed along with affirmations to the afflicted part some 10- 20 times a day. This can take anywhere from 1-2 minutes, but must be done as much as possible, any time you can focus, until you are completely healed. Click Here for more information about healing. FOR BLACK MAGICK: Use the rosary the same way, to pump negative energy into your target. IMPORTANT! For black magick workings, it is very important to use a separate rosary. The rosary accumulates energy and can become more and more powerful each time you use it. Obviously, contrary energies here can clash and cancel each other out. I have used the Satanic Rosary for both attaining my desires, and for just raising my energies. Working with runes is extremely powerful and during the meditation, it is not unusual to see certain aspects of your soul and feel the energy aligning itself. 449"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Color Meditation *This meditation requires the 'breathing' in of energy. You should have experience with the Foundation Meditation before performing this meditation. Unfortunately, “white light” is overused by many Wiccan and New Age people who don’t know what they are doing. These people use white light to the exclusion of all other colors, and as a result are not competent in working with colors. Because white contains *all* of the colors of the spectrum, they are taking in all of these colors and those they are unable to control or work with, are left on their own without direction. Each color represents a particular frequency of energy that most of us use in our daily lives. If one is not competent in the ability to handle each color, the white light often is unable to be used properly. White light is easy enough to use and is great for beginners, but the problem is that it is overused. White light is great for cleaning one’s aura and balancing energies. It is also great for protection. White light, when placed around a person, becomes a barrier to interaction with others. This is because white light reflects. If you want to be left alone, then envelope yourself in white light. Filling yourself with white light on the inside strengthens and protects without becoming a barrier to others if you want social interaction. Overuse of white light can create an arrogant attitude, especially where spirituality is concerned, along with closed mindedness, and rigidity in attitudes. This is often seen in those who practice angel magick. The overall result is that of being at a lower level of spiritual development. When an individual is competent and has mastered all of the colors, he/she is able to use the white light to its fullest extent. The Color Meditation: Begin by getting comfortable and doing breathing exercises or whatever you do to focus your mind and calm yourself before entering into your trance state. Breathe in and fill yourself with each breath with a specific color of the spectrum, visualizing it as brighter and brighter each time (not lighter; by brighter, I mean more intense): Red, blue, yellow, orange, violet, green, indigo (bluish-violet, the color of the 6th chakra) or black. This meditation can also be done after meditating on a specific chakra. You can then fill yourself with the color of that chakra. If you are new to color meditation, hold the color for two to four minutes. If the color feels pleasant, you can hold for a longer period of time. Those who are used to the energy of the colors can hold much longer. One’s increased time should be comfortable and gradual. Each color should be in its pure form and bright. Later on, it is fine to experiment with different shades when adept. If a color feel negative to you, work with it gradually. Ask your mind for an answer as to why. What does the color mean to you? What associations do you have with a particular color? This is a great way to find out more about yourself. Which colors feel pleasant to you? These are the ones that you may be using the most in your life to the exclusion of others. Knowing this provides information as to which chakras need more work to bring them up to full power. 450"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"The most important objective of this meditation is to *feel* the colors. Spend some time with each color, getting into how it feels. Keep a written record in your book of shadows/black book. Also, you can meditate on the color outside of yourself to feel its energy. It is not necessary to always absorb the color, especially if you feel uncomfortable with certain colors. Remember, if something feels uncomfortable or negative, then stop. When you are finished with this meditation, clean your aura with white light as this will act to balance the all of the colors in your aura. The benefits of this meditation are the ability to feel, direct and apply color. Color energy is exceptionally powerful when used in magick. Each color has specific energies and acts to bring results unique to that energy. 451"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Meditating on Chakra Sounds Each chakra has a standard sound. By meditating on these sounds and focusing on the specific chakra, this is one way of opening up your astral hearing. • Base Chakra, the physical Level: Sounds include thunder or a soft hissing. Red • Sacral Chakra, the astral Level: Roar like the ocean or the sound of wind. Orange • Third chakra the level of will: H-h-h-a-a-h-h-h sound (silent, like an exhale- no voice; long and continuous) or the sound of humming/vibration “aum.” Yellow • Heart Chakra, the intuitional Level: Buzzing like a bee (bioelectricity) or the sound of a flute. Green • Throat Chakra the mental Level: Azazel gave me a sound. The best way I can describe it is like twisting a balloon. Humming can also be used. Blue • 6th Chakra, the soul Level The sound of woodwind instruments. Bluish violet (indigo) • Crown Chakra, the blissful Level Whisper or no sound- this is felt rather than heard. Violet The above levels and sounds are guidelines only to get one started. Focus on a particular chakra, and imagine the corresponding sound as best you can.

Relax and go into a trance state 2. Inhale and visualize white-gold energy entering through your third eye into your pineal gland. 3. Draw the energy in with each inhale, then brighten, and expand your pineal gland with the energy with each exhale. 4. The first few times you do this, affirm to yourself: \"I am breathing in powerful white-gold energy that is safely stimulating my pineal gland.\" 5. When you are finished, feel the energy for a few minutes and meditate on it. It should be very pleasurable. This meditation activates and empowers the pineal gland. The pineal gland is the psychic powerhouse of the brain. White-gold is the most powerful of all of the colors. It is the color of the Sun and this is one of the reasons the original religions worshipped the Sun. 453"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Empowering Your Hand Chakras What this exercise does, when done consistently is to establish an energy circuit within the hand chakras. This energy can be used for healing, opening other chakras, applying energy or as with Dim Mak, the \"death touch.\" It also helps with telekinesis (moving objects with one's mind and pyrokinesis (setting objects on fire using the powers of the mind and aura). In order to advance with these gifts, a powerful aura is needed to act on the auras of objects. This exercise should be done at least once a day to get your energy flowing freely through your hand chakras. 1. Sit comfortably and relax. Try to go into a trance as the deeper the trance and level of concentration, the better the results, especially when beginning this exercise. After an energy current within the hand chakras is open and flowing, this can be done anywhere at will. 2. Put your hands facing each other, fingertips almost touching and relaxed. (Your fingers can be slightly bent as in the illustration). 3. With the pad of your thumb, press into the palm of each of your hands, right in the hollow part. 4. Now, focus intensly upon your hands, especially your palms. Feel the area you pressed in with your thumb. 5. Keep focusing all of your concentration and begin to feel a warm glow and energy between your palms. 6. Begin to move your hands an inch or two apart slowly and back again to where your fingertips are almost touching. Try to feel the energy between the palms of your hands. The more you practice and the stronger your energy becomes, keep moving your hands in and out, further and further apart until you can feel your energy as far apart as two or more feet. 7. Now, visualize a ball of white hot fire like the sun as in the picture above. Later on, you can use colors. Feel the heat and energy from this ball of fire between your hands. This may feel as a tingling or throbbing. For some people, it may even feel cold. The important thing is to get this energy flowing and to *feel* it. 8. Now let your arms hang down and relax. Focus on energy flowing down your arms into your hands. This may feel tingly and your lower arms and hands may feel pumped. This is a sign the enrgy is flowing. Now repeat steps 5-7 above. 9.

Each of the chakras, the second through the sixth has an opposite chakra in the front of the body along the abdomen. The sixth chakra has three. The rear sixth chakra located at the occipital in the back of the head, the middle sixth chakra is located between the third eye and the occipital sixth chakra. To perform the meditation, visualize a small ball of bright light the size of a ping-pong ball and light up a chakra on your spine with it and pass it to the front chakra directly opposite it and light it up, then pass it back to the chakra on your spine. Keep passing it back and forth to each chakra, then move up or down to the next chakra (whichever one you want to work with). The illustration on the left shows an example with the sixth chakra. You can either visualize the ball as white-gold light or the color of the chakra you are working with. You can also connect the crown to the base. I found the energy center located in the perineum to be especially powerful with this. Just pass it up and down. Now another interesting thing one can do with this is to connect with another person and this greatly enhances telepathy. For example, passing the ball back and forth from their heart chakra to your’s will tell you about the other person’s emotional experiences and character. To interrogate someone, pass the ball of light from your third eye to their third eye, back and forth. Now, it is obvious you can, with experience invade others’ privacy and this also includes your own- just something to be aware of if you don’t want anyone in your personal business. In that case, close down your chakras, if someone does this against your will. 456"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Secreting Ectoplasm About Ectoplasm: Ectoplasm has many different astral uses. Extra-terrestrials use this in a much more potent form than humans. This is the cloud that forms before many abductions, where there is a loss of time and memory. Ectoplasm can make one invisible and can be used to kill with death rituals. After proficiency is achieved in producing this substance, one can will it to manifest in specific colors that are harmonious with the objective of the working. The most common example of the use of ectoplasm is with mediums. The ectoplasm gives the evoked spirit something to manifest itself in. Ectoplasm can also add much more potency to creating a thoughtform. How to secrete ectoplasm: Ectoplasm is the substance we see with the clouds when scrying. This is a minor form of ectoplasm, but will get you started. Candle light is perfect for this exercise. Candle color here does not matter, so use whatever you have available. If you have a black mirror, you will want to use this, but any other similar props will do. You can even use a regular mirror or a bowl of dark or black liquid. 1. Sit in a quiet dimly lit room. 2. Relax and go into a trance state. This does not have to be a deep trance, just enough so you are focused. 3. Look into the mirror or bowl of liquid and stare at one point. You should eventually see clouds form. 4. Concentrate on these clouds, willing them in a soft way to condense and thicken. 5. When you are consistently able to will the clouds to condense and thicken, gently and slowly take your eyes off the mirror. You should still be able to see the clouds in front of you. Try to focus on them for two to three minutes. The goal is to secrete this substance and to manipulate it at will. 6. Blink your eyes and move your fingers and toes and gently bring yourself back from the trance. When you become proficient at secreting ectoplasm, will the ectoplasm into a ball shape. From there, work at making it thicker and form it into different shapes. This will take practice so be patient. After a time, you can will it into different colors for specific purposes. 457"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Ascending Energy Meditation 1. Lie down and begin by stimulating yourself to orgasm. Right at the point of the impending climax, visualize a fiery brilliant bright light at your perineum (the area between your rectum and testicles for men; or between the rectum and vagina for women). 2. Inhale and direct the energy from the orgasm while you are climaxing, up your spine. You should visualize this as a bright white-gold light.* Draw the energy up your spine to the crown chakra where it lights it up and empowers it, emerging from the top of your head and into your eighth gold chakra. Brighten your eighth gold chakra. 3. Expand your eighth chakra into a ball approximately two feet in diameter (60 cm). 4. Exhale and expand the energy from your eighth chakra and then direct it to descend down each side of your body, down through the bottoms of your feet and back up to your base chakra where you inhale it again. 5. Inhale and draw it in again at the base chakra, lighting it up and empowering it upon entering and then visualize it ascending your spine again and repeat the above steps 2-5. With each circulation, you can expand your aura with the energy. The orgasm gets the energy going and you can keep circulating it for as long as you wish. Always direct the energy up out your crown.

You can work this into your daily meditation program. Normally, there are three major knots. One at the base, one at the heart and one at the 6th chakra. Usually, our base chakra is open. A burning sensation or feeling of intense pressure in one of the chakras usually indicates the one above it is blocked. For example, some people experience a burning in the throat, which indicates the 6th chakra is blocked. 1. Hand Energy One way to unblock and empower a chakra is once you have a strong energy flow through your palm chakras and fingertips, you can apply this to your individual chakras. You should feel a tingling sensation and heat radiating from your palm chakras that indicates they are empowered and active. Place your hand over whatever chakra you feel needs more energy and relax. Direct the energy from your palm chakra into the selected chakra for anywhere from 5-15 minutes. A warm or burning sensation in the chakra during and afterward, indicates the chakra is receiving the energy. Doing this regularly will strengthen the selected chakra. 2. Chakra Breathing. • Inhale and breathe in color energy into the blocked chakra. The energy should be the same color as the chakra you are working on. • Hold your breath for a count of six and visualize your chakra opening. Most agree the best method is to visualize the bud of a flower blooming. Make sure you visualize the correct color. • Exhale and brighten and expand the chakra • Inhale through your base chakra brilliant white-gold light and direct it up your spine and through the chakra you are trying to open and direct it out your crown. • Exhale and visualize your chakra bright with the white-gold energy and expand it. • Repeat the above exercise several times. 3. Sexual Orgasm This is what the old alchemy texts implied. Just keep hitting it with orgasmic energy. Visualize a brilliant light ascending into and through the chakra. This works well to open a meditation. 4. Breathe in through your entire aura and body the color energy of the blocked chakra. Visualize this energy growing brighter and brighter and expanding with each exhale. Repeat several times. Eventually, the chakra will be strong enough to naturally take up energy on its own. Strong chakras can absorb energy. Weak chakras that are blocked are depleted and unable to attract and absorb energy on their own. Weak and blocked areas create diseases associated with the particular chakra and visa-versa- diseases create the weak chakra. Choose one of more of the above exercises and do it/them daily until the problem is corrected. 459"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"The Aura and How to Use It Everything has an aura, whether it is living or inanimate. The aura is an energy field created by the vibrating atoms and molecules that comprise all matter. The universe itself vibrates to a certain frequency and the gravity that holds everything together is electromagnetic in nature. Everyone’s aura is as unique as his or her own fingerprints. No two auras are alike. The aura can be used to protect, attract, influence, maim, or even kill. This field of bioelectricity surrounding living things can be programmed using the power of one’s mind. Those who are trained and have an active third eye can see auras clearly and discern much personal information just by reading the color, strength, size and shape of one’s aura. To see your own aura, you should start out by going into a light trance state. You should have already opened your third eye. Hold your hand out in front of you, preferably against a dark background. In the beginning, you should be able to see some faint lines surrounding your hand and fingers. The more you tune into this, like anything, (practice is what is needed here), the better you will become. The better you become at seeing your own aura, you soon will be able to see the auras of others, by just tuning in to them. Later on, you will be able to see colors, layers, and shapes. Feeling auras is much easier than seeing them. Power meditation, when done consistently, increases one’s sensitivity to energy. Manipulation of energy is essential in working spells and magick. To feel your aura, run one of your hands over the top of the other, or over your forearm. You should feel the energy. You can also practice feeling the auras of friends and family members if they are interested in letting you do so. This will develop your touch sensitivity. To strengthen and build your aura, you must take in energy. This can be done through power meditation. The Energy Meditation is excellent for charging up your aura. Hatha (physical) Yoga and Tai Chi also help to strengthen and build the aura. Both of these disciplines tend to balance the auric energies as well. Cleaning your aura is very important. A clean healthy aura strengthens the immune system and prevents harmful energies from invading one’s body. Nearly all harmful entities are invisible to the naked eye. Energies, as most physicists know, can be broken down into sub-atomic particles, foe example, light can be broken down into photons. The energy radiated by a powerful aura will burn these harmful energies and entities up before they can do any harm. B. Cleaning your aura (powerful white light) is imperative after any rituals involving the employment of black magick, throwing any curses, no matter how small, on the spur of the moment, or any exercise involving the use of negative or destructive energy. One’s chakras should also be cleaned and empowered. This is done by putting a strong and intense white light on each chakra. This is needed to rid one’s self of any residual negative energies that could otherwise do harm. This also prevents rebounding energies. Always take as much time as you need; never be in a hurry. Prevention is always better than having to deal with problems later on. A powerful aura gives health, happiness, charisma, and energy. People with weak auras are usually in poor health and are depressed. Our personal energies act on our environments and direct our fate. People who have weak auras are usually prone to misfortune. The aura can be programmed with power hypnosis. Read the page on power hypnosis to make 460"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"maximum use of the following workings. Now, with dealing with the aura and subconscious mind, one must always be 100% clear on every aspect of what is desired. With love, we don’t want one who is unavailable.

When working with the mind as in ceremonial magick, energy takes the quickest and easiest route to bring us the desired result and if every aspect isn’t covered, any undirected energy will seek out whatever is available. Color is especially important when programming the aura. Below are examples of how we can effectively program our auras to do things: For example: You want love in your life: Visualize your aura while you are in a trance, the deeper the better. Breathe in energy and affirm several times in the present tense: “My aura is attracting my perfect [love/sexual partner, soul mate, whatever]. Change the affirmation to suit your own individual needs. Affirm this with meaning, five- ten times while breathing in energy. To attract the love/lust and or attentions of a specific person: Affirm: I am programming my aura to attract and act on_________’s, aura. He/she finds me very attractive and sexually irresistible. You want/need protection: Breathe in powerful white-gold light. With the inhale breathe it in to meet in the middle of your body, packing it in brighter and brighter. With the exhale, keep expanding it. The energy should grow brighter and brighter. Affirm: My aura is very powerful and is protecting me at all times. This a good exercise to be done on a regular basis, for building a strong, protective energy field. You want to make a good impression: A powerful aura will often influence others to grant you favors. Affirm: My aura is making a very positive impression on _______. If this is a job interview, (the person(s) interviewing me tomorrow, whatever). The people hearing my presentation, the group etc. Always state this in the present tense. The subconscious mind does not understand the word “will” and “will” never comes. For keeping unwanted individuals away: Breathe in white light like the Sun. White light reflects and repels. Affirm: ”My aura is repelling, [inspire fear/dread] in_______, and keeping ________far away from me at all times. To heal yourself: A lot of energy is needed for healing. Breathing in energy from the Sun is excellent for empowering one’s aura. The Sun also contains all of the colors of the chakras in their most pure and vibrant states. The Sun (666) is one of the most powerful sources of energy there is. When one is ill, there is an imbalance in the chakras ruling the body part/s that are injured or ill. To heal, you must work with both the color of the ruling chakra and its opposite to create a balance. Breathe in the color of the energy of the chakra ruling the injured or ill body part and affirm: ”I am breathing in __(name of color)__ energy that is balancing my __chakra__ and healing my_______.

For inciting lust: Put a powerful red or orange aura around the person.

You should also use color energy (see the above paragraph on healing for one’s self) Affirm: I am putting powerful healing energy into ______'s aura; this energy is effectively fighting the _______ and restoring him/her to perfect health. In cases of serious illness, this may have to be done often every day. Healing others can be extremely draining. If you are inexperienced, remote healing is best. Direct contact as with the hand chakras applying energy directly to the afflicted one can be dangerous. The illness can be absorbed into the healer. To do this type of direct work, one must have a powerful aura and work to clean it thoroughly after each healing session. Using the energy of the Sun is most effective here. BLACK MAGICK AND KILLING. Killing: This is best done while the offending party is asleep. Put a black aura around the person, as this will prepare his or her own aura to absorb the destructive energy. After doing this, you can vent your hatred. Be sure to visualize over and over again with feeling, exactly how you intend this person to die. Affirm: I am placing a powerful aura of destructive around______ that is continuously working to kill him/her. This work is best begun on a Saturday or a Tuesday during a waning Moon. Be sure to clean your aura and chakras following each working. To cause bad luck and/or harm: If your own aura is powerful enough, just sitting and stewing about the person should be enough. I have found it is important to visualize repeatedly in a relaxed, but angry way a specific misfortune. With all workings of black magick the outcome depends on the strength of the auras involved. The aura of the victim *must* be weaker than that of the sorcerer. If the victim’s aura is more powerful, the working could rebound as a more powerful aura naturally deflects negative energy.

Ruled by the planet Mercury- yellow can be used for passing exams, improving the mind, for deeper concentration, mental power, learning ability, speech, writing, publishing, media concerns, gossip, slander, interviews, brothers, sisters, neighbors, rumors, theft, all areas of study and communication, also astral projection, overcoming addictions, and breaking habits. Good for friendship, imagination, creativity (orange is more powerful for creativity), inspiration and charisma. Yellow can be used to incite infidelity, cowardliness, decay, disease, dying, insanity, and inconsistency in others. Yellow is of the element of air. Yellow rules the solar plexus chakra. Grey: NEVER USE GREY ON YOURSELF! Grey is the color of illness and bad energy. Grey, applied repeatedly to the aura of a hated one, can bring about a slow death, if programmed to do so. 464"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Chakra Breathing To perform this meditation, you should already be experienced with the Foundation Meditation. Relax and enter into a trance state, then, instead of breathing in energy into your entire body as with the energy meditation, breathe in energy into each one of your chakras, for seven breaths each. Seven breaths is only a guideline; you can do more or less, but it is important to keep your chakras in balance. It is important to not only breathe in the energy, but also to visualize it. You can breathe in white-gold energy (the most powerful) or the color energy of the chakra. When you are finished breathing each of the chakras, breathe in energy through all of your seven chakras, front and back to meet in the middle. After this, perform the Foundation Meditation. Tips: This meditation can also be done on just one chakra that is lacking in energy or that is blocked. Just apply the breathing one or more times a day. The rest of the meditation is unnecessary if you are working on a specific weak chakra. Azazel showed me the power of the sun. Most of us are familiar with drawing down energy from the moon and other planets. The sun is hundreds of times more powerful. The energy of the sun contains all of the colors of the spectrum in their purest forms. Performing this full meditation out of doors under the sun can give you incredible energy and is also very healing. Just affirm \"I am breathing in powerful white-gold (or whatever color) energy from the sun, into my ______ chakra.\" Repeat this several times and then visualize yourself absorbing the energy and brightening your chakras with it. 465"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Meditations for Astral Projection Astral projection is where your soul actually leaves your body. This is different from remote viewing where you enter into a trance and will yourself to a specific location. The following two meditations are just basic guidelines. I suggest for more in depth information to click on the PDF links below. Meditation 1 This meditation feels weird. Just make sure you seriously want to project, otherwise, any hesitation can keep you in your body. You have to be relaxed, both mentally and physically. The first few times are the most difficult. Like with anything else, consistent practice will make this easier, until you no longer have to even enter into a deep trance, but can project any time at will. Some people find projecting easier than others, as they have done this in past lives. 1. Get real comfortable and go into a trance. When you are so relaxed you can no longer feel your body, you are ready. 2. Visualize your astral body inside your physical body, being held there by your seven chakras. The chakras can be visualized like colored knobs. 3. Take each spinning chakra and stop it from spinning and give it a quarter turn in the reverse of the direction it was spinning, like turning a doorknob. 4. Relax and let go and try to exit. Meditation 2 This is more like a preparatory exercise. This one is not nearly as powerful as the one above, but less intense for those of you who would rather do this gradually. 1. Lie down and relax, as above. Go into a trance. Relax to where you feel like you are floating. 2. Now, lift your left astral arm up. Visualize this. You will need to imagine this, but energy follows where it is directed. 3. Lift up your right astral arm and touch your face 4. Touch both your astral hands together. 5. Do the same thing with each leg and foot. 6. Imagine your entire astral body floating above your physical body, or somewhere else in the room and concentrate on being there. Just lie there and focus on this for a while. Keep repeating this exercise often and eventually, astral projection will follow. 466"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Aura Empowering Meditation This meditation is excellent for extra energy when done regularly. It is quite powerful and builds over time. This meditation can also be done outside; drawing in energy form the Sun. This seriously amplifies the energy. 1. Enter into a trance state, the deeper the better and begin by cleaning your aura and chakras. 2. Breathe energy in for six breaths, visualizing a brilliant white-gold light surrounding your entire head, both inside and out, down to your neck. Then relax and focus on feeling and visualize this energy for around five minutes. This can be done while listening to music as this also helps with timing. After this, breathe in energy and charge up your crown, third eye and your sixth chakra behind your third eye by visualizing an even brighter light on each of these chakras. 3. Now move to your neck and do the same. Breathe in energy for six breaths and charge up your throat chakra. 4. Move to your shoulders and charge them up as you did with the other chakras, breathing energy in for six breaths and then relaxing and focusing upon it for five minutes. There are lesser chakras in all of the joints. Move down your arms and do the same with your elbows, then wrists. The elbows and wrists contain minor chakras as well and by charging up and empowering these; you open yourself up for a better energy flow. Now move down to your hands and visualize either white-gold balls of energy in your palms. Concentrate and relax on this bright light lighting up your arms and hands for several minutes. 5. Now, move to your torso, do the same, and charge up your heart, solar, sexual and base chakras with the brilliant energy. Concentrate for several minutes on this. 6. Move to your hips and charge up the chakras in your hips with the energy and then your thighs and knees. The knees contain small chakras as well. Move to your ankles, charge up the chakras there and then to your feet. Visualize two balls of brilliant white-gold light beneath your feet, like you did with your hands. This exercise should not be done before bedtime as the energy can keep you awake. For healing, after completing the above, just focus and place the light/energy onto the unhealthy body part for 10-15 minutes. If you are doing any healing, this must be done every day and never skip a day or progress could rebound. 467"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"Single Serpent Meditation This meditation, like the serpent meditation, is very powerful and should only be practiced by those who are advanced meditators and have strong enough chakras. Azazel helped to revise this meditation with the addition of the extended serpent. (Like the images from Ancient Egypt with the serpent emerging from the third eye demonstrate, the extended serpent is a psychic sensor that we can use. It can extend a lot farther than one or two feet. This meditation works to empower the sensor) 1. Sit with your spine straight 2. Focus on your base chakra, glowing with a powerful vibrant red-gold. 3. Visualize the serpent glowing with the brilliant light and power as well, lighting up the base chakra to white-gold like the sun, and exiting the base chakra from the left side. 4. The serpent curves outwards to the left side of the body before it curves back to the right to enter the 2nd sacral chakra on the left side. When it enters the sacral chakra, visualize this chakra lighting up in orange-gold. 5. It emerges from the right side of the 2nd chakra, curving out and then back in to the left where it enters the 3rd solar plexus chakra from the right side, lighting it up to white-gold and empowering it. 6. Emerging on the left side of the 3rd chakra, it curves out and then back in to the right to the 4th heart chakra where it enters on the left side and lights it up with green-gold energy. 7. Emerging on the right side of the 4th chakra, arcing out and then back in to the left to enter the 5th throat chakra on the right side, lighting it up with bright blue energy and empowering it. 8. Emerging from the left of the throat chakra, the serpent again arcs out to the left, then in to the right again where it enters the 6th chakra behind the 3rd eye from the left side. Light up this chakra with brilliant blue-violet energy, charging it and empowering it. 9. The serpent emerges from the front of the 6th chakra. It will take an alternative route. Visualize the serpent entering the 3rd eye from the rear and exiting from the front of the third eye. Extend the serpent about one foot beyond your third eye and try to feel the projection from your aura. 10. Retract the serpent back into your third eye and back into your 6th chakra, then begin the path of descending. 11. Direct the serpent to enter the right side of your throat chakra, lighting it up and it emerges from the left side of the throat chakra, arcing out and in again to enter the heart chakra on the left side, lighting it up. 12.

Relax and be completely comfortable. Clean your aura and chakras. 2. Visualize your base chakra lighting up into a brilliant glow. Then visualize a brilliant stream of light rising from this glowing chakra. The stream of light will then connect with your second chakra, lighting it up into a brilliant glow. Do this, connecting each chakra and lighting it up all the way to the crown. You may also want to connect your gold chakra above your head (this is optional). 3. Now expand the stream of light into a staff. Visualize the pole spinning. Spin faster and faster. The staff should be glowing brilliantly. Now, command the pole to spin at the speed of light. 4. Now focus at the base chakra again, glowing in a ball of brilliant light. From this base, two serpents will emerge. They will move outwards, just like in the caduceus and then turn back inwards to connect with each other at the second (sexual) chakra, lighting it up. 5. They move back outwards again and then inwards to connect with the third (solar) chakra, lighting it up. 6. Moving back outwards, they then turn in at the heart chakra and do the same. Continue this all the way to the crown or 8th and 9th chakras. 7. Now go back and spin the staff at the speed of light. 8. Now return to the serpent if you wish to do another round and repeat. 470"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Preliminary Mediations for Invoking the Elements In order to really become adept, one must master the elements. This is also the message of the Mage card of the Tarot. You must be healthy to invoke the elements. For those of you who wish to go slowly, these preliminary meditations can help: For Fire: 1. Sit quietly and relax. 2. Visualize a large bonfire. *Hear* the crackling and *feel* the heat, then *smell* the heat. Do this for five minutes. For Water: 1. Sit quietly and relax. 2. Visualize yourself wading in water. This can be a lake, the river or the ocean. *Feel* the water, *hear* the water and *smell* the water, like you are actually there. Do this for five minutes. For Earth: 1. Sit quietly and relax. 2. Visualize yourself walking barefoot on the earth. This is best if you can visulize yourself walking on soil in a farm field as this is very close to the element of earth. *Feel* the soil under your bare feet and *hear* and *feel* the light breeze through the air and *smell* the earth. Do this for five minutes. For Air: 1. Sit quietly and relax. 2. Visualize yourself walking against the wind. *Feel* the wind blow against your skin and the roar of the wind in your ears. *Smell* the fresh air as it blows against you. Feel each step walking into the wind. Do this for five minutes. Next Step for Fire: 1. Sit quietly and relax. Visualize yourself walking throuigh the desert. *Feel* the searing heat and the dry hot wind in the scorching environment. Feel the sand beneath your feet and your body growing hotter. Do this exercise for three to four minutes and no longer. Next Step for Water: 471"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"1. Sit quietly and relax. Visualize yourself in a cold environment. Feel yourself getting cold. Feel the cold wind blow on your skin. For those of you who know snow (some brothers and sisters live in tropical environments, so not everyone has experienced snow), visualize yourself in snow and ice. Hear the crunching of the snow beneath your feet. For those of you who have never experienced snow- just visualize yourself in a cold environment and use all of your astral senses. Do this exercise for three to four minutes and no longer. What the above exercises do: In addition to strengthening your astral senses, these exercises will introduce you to working with the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. By invoking these elements, we can strengthen ourselves to where we will be able to withstand incredible amounts of heat, cold and other extremes. Invoking and directing fire is a very important aspect of pyrokinesis. With invoking the fire element, we can keep warm or with the water element, cool if circumstances call for this. Invocation of fire is how the Tibetan monks spent the nights of their initiation in the ice cold mountains, naked under in a wet sheet in a snow storm. In the morning, if the initiate passed, the sheet was warm and dry and the snow and ice were melted in the surrounding area. Some 1920's-30's Satanic Lodges in Germany used the element of fire for assassination. The element when invoked and directed to the victim would make the victim's blood literally boil. The air element, when invoked properly, produces levitation. Through invocation and proper direction of the elements, we can also influence the weather. The foundation of advanced magick is through the control of the elements, this includes healing and all aspects of magick, white, black and grey. 472"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Merging Consciousness *When you are finished with merging with a human being or animal, be sure to clean your aura and chakras thoroughly as their thoughts or beliefs can rub off on you. Always choose a healthy being when you are new to this, be it a plant or a human being. Meditation One: 1. Choose an object, this can be a crystal, a table- anything in your room. Beginners should start with an object that is a single material, like a rock or playing dice. 2. Get comfortable and go into a trance state. 3. Look at the object in front of you for a minute or two and then close your eyes. Visualize the object. 4. Now enlarge the object so it is big enough for you to walk into in your mind and enter it. 5. Become one with the object and open your astral senses. What do you see, hear, smell, feel? Is it cold or warm inside? What sensations do you feel? If the object is on a table or hard surface, *feel* that surface. Meditation Two: Do the same as the above, only this time use a plant. This can be a tree or even a blade of grass. If you don't have any house-plants, you might want to do this exercise out of doors. It is important that the plant be alive. With the plant exercise, *feel* the earth through the roots of the plant. How does this plant feel in relation to other plants around it if out of doors? Meditation Three: Now, do the same as the above, but this time merge with an animal. You can visualize this animal if you are not near any animals. If you have pets, then choose one of your pets and merge with your pet. See through his/her eyes, hear through his/her ears; feel the floor or ground beneath his/her feet. How does your pet's body feel? Is your pet warm? Cold? Hungry? What does your pet smell in the environment? Use his/her nose. What is in your pet's mind? Animals think in visions. Meditation Four: Now, do the above with a person you know. You can choose a different person each day. Think with their mind. What the above exercises do: Plenty. They are *very* important. When mastered, the above exercises will give you skills to... • Shapeshift • Communicate with animals • Plant thoughts in the minds of others and to even possess them • Fix electrical equipment and appliances- you can find the problem by merging with the item. • Pull thoughts out of the minds of others and obtain information • Diagnose diseases in humans and animals • Students can use this to merge with their teachers to find what questions will be posted on an important exam 473"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"Satanic Telepathic Communication Father Satan showed me this technique. To open telepathic communication between two people: 1. Open your third eye (you should have already performed the opening of the third eye foundation exercise). To open your third eye, visualize a bright light about the size of a quarter, shining like the sun. This will activate your third eye. 2. Visualize the face of the person whom you wish to communicate with and open their third eye by visualizing it brightening, the same as you did with your own. In some cases, those who do not have their third eye open may be able to receive your messsages, but for best results, both people should be fully open. 3. Extend your third eye serpent. To extend the third eye serpent, visualize a bright thin tube-like extension projecting from your third eye. 4. Connect your serpent to the third eye of the one whom you wish to communicate with, brightening both third eyes with energy as well as the tube. Telepathic communication should be established.

Several years ago, Father Satan spoke with me concerning healing. I had a problem and he told me at that time \"You are not strong enough.\" I had a heavy radio setting beside me and he stated an example \"Try moving that radio using a sheet of paper.\" Obviously the paper would have crumpled. To effectively heal, your soul must have power. This is accomplished through consistent power meditation. Once your soul is powerful enough, healing comes much easier. Before I go on, I want to state that anyone who is under a doctor's care or taking medication SHOULD NOT stop taking ANY medication prescribed or forego medical treatment, antibiotics, etc., until given a medical clearance by a licensed physician. We are not xians! Antibiotics and such SAVE LIVES! I, myself am very grateful for modern medical technology. The ability to heal using your own powers is very advanced and takes experience. If you do not like the advice of one doctor, then get a second opinion from another doctor, but do not just go about psychic healing and deny yourself or others in your care, such as children or animals, proper and prompt professional medical treatment. Never stop taking any medication, or alter prescribed doses unless given the ok by your doctor. To heal yourself, you should already have experience in working magick. 1. Make sure your chakras are properly aligned. This ensures that needed energy is getting to them. Disease usually manifests in the soul/astral body before symptoms occur in the physical body. This is almost always due to poor energy/chi circulation to the organ/s or a cut-off of a pathway due to an accident, or injury. 2. You should begin by cleaning the diseased part as you would clean your aura. Cleaning the diseased part should be done several times every day immediately before applying the healing energy. 3. The foundation of healing for most problems is to raise and direct energy and keep sending it to the afflicted organ, while programming it. When you FEEL your energy strongly, just direct it to the diseased/afflicted part of your body. Throughout the day, you can also keep directing your energy and visualize the white-gold light, lighting up the organ and state your affirmation. This can be done lightly, in addition to the more formal working in step 2. 4. Step two needs to be repeated several times every day, until healing is complete. 5. Healing can also be done using Runes. Vibration is exceptionally powerful in both raising and empowering energy. 6. You have to KNOW it is working and not have any doubts. In other words, have faith in your ability. 7. Always remember to keep your affirmations in the present tense. \"The__(disease)__ is leaving my body (or diseased organ), completely and permanently. My________ is strong, healthy and normal in every way.\" 8. Be open. Many times the working will lead us to certain foods or what we need in order to heal health problems. This can come in different ways. To heal a loved one, direct white-gold brilliant light like the Sun into him/her and program it. 477"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"The foundation and objective of Spiritual Satanism is knowledge and applying that knowledge by using our own powers. I had a situation some time ago, with a pet who had a life threatening disorder that occurred all of a sudden. At the time, I had no money for a vet. Father Satan came to me. He stood behind me and placed both of his hands on my shoulders and told me to \"breathe\" energy into her. I visualized the energy as the white-gold light and lit her up with it, as brilliant as the Sun and stated an affirmation \"______ is healthy, safe, and protected in every way.\" I did this twenty times. Father Satan told me, NO, do it 200 times. He also told me she would need to have surgery and he would get me the money. I started to cry. He told me not to cry, as this was a lack of faith. The energy I put into her stabilized her. I had to do it again and shortly thereafter, I had the money for t he surgery, which was very expensive. She got the surgery and she is now fine. Healing Loved Ones When we perform Satanic healing on our loved ones, it is quite different than working on ourselves. It is best to use healing energy from the earth and let it run through us into the loved one. To do this, it is very important to have open, active and powerful chakras especially in your hands and feet. Your soul must be strong enough. This comes with repeated and consistent power meditations. Depending upon the severity of the illness or problem, more than one healing session is often necessary. This also depends upon the strength of your own powers. Several months ago, I healed one of my pets by placing my hands over where she was having the problem. I opened both my hand and feet chakras and began drawing in energy through my feet (I was in my house) and directed the healing energy out my palm chakras, all the time visualizing the white- gold brilliant light on her, and affirming she was healed. My powers were also at their height as I did this following a hatha yoga session and power meditation. In this instance, it only took one session and she was fine. There are some guidelines for healing loved ones: 1. Make sure you are strong enough and it is best not to use your own energies. Pulling energy from the earth (this can be from the floor), the sun or any other natural source is best. Always run the energy through yourself. 2. Make sure to completely clean your aura and chakras afterwards. 3. In cases of serious accidents or related, the more people involved in the healing, the better the chance for recovery. Friends, relatives and so forth, if they are at all open-minded can be organized into drawing in energy and applying it to the afflicted one in an emergency situation. Even people who are not trained and who know nothing are better than not doing a thing. The more people, the more energy. 4. Like working any and all magick, one must have confidence in and believe in a full recovery. 5. Affirmations are always necessary as energy does what it is told to do. Affirmations should always be in the present tense and of a positive statement. 6. Once healing sessions are begun, depending upon the severity, they should be repeated until the loved one has made a full and complete recovery. 7. Cleaning the area or body using a brilliant white light before applying healing energy also helps. 478"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"8. As with healing the self- severe cases may require several healing sessions per day. This also depends upon your own personal powers. The more powerful you are, the more powerful and effective your healing energy. Extremely powerful brothers and sisters may only do one healing session with a complete recovery. 9. The longer (more chronic) the ailment, the more difficult it is to heal. Congenital problems (afflictions one is born with) are the most difficult. Nothing is impossible! The human mind is even capable of growing a new limb. The key is extreme personal power through consistent meditation, patience, perseverence and above all -CONSISTENCY! Satanic Healing and the Solar Chakra The chakra of healing is the solar (3rd) chakra. To heal using this chakra (which is very effective): 1. Lie on your back 2. Your hand chakras and finger chakras should be fully opened for this techique. Place your fingertips lightly upon on your solar plexus chakra. Very slowly breathe in and visualize intense brilliant white-gold light entering into your nostrils moving down into your solar chakra and then through your fingertips and into your forearms. 3. Hold your breath and transfer your fingertips to where you are ill and very slowly exhale the energy from your forearms, hands and fingertips into the afflicted area. For example, for curing a soar throat, move your fingertips, (all the while visualizing the brilliant light), to your throat and then very slowly exhale the energy into your throat, visualizing and feeling it leaving your forearms, hands and fingertips and entering into your throat, glowing like a brilliant sun. 4. When the exhale is completed, suspend your breathing for a few seconds while you place your fingertips upon your solar chakra again. Repeat the above. The above is best performed for 10-20 repititions. If major healing is called for, take a break and then perform another 10-20 repititions. I have used the above techique with much success. It is very important to try to catch colds, flu, viruses, etc., in the early stages. By doing so, less energy is required and one can use one's own energy. If one is ill to where using one's own energy is out of the question, this exercise can also be performed using the energy from the sun, which is very powerful. Just breathe in the energy from the sun into your nostrils and follow the above instructions. It is pretty evident that now and in the very near future, we will be faced with deadly strains of viruses and plagues. Many are resistant to antibiotics and other medications. In many places, life saving medications are becoming unaffordable and very hard to obtain, as is medical care. Some medications are even laced with placeboes (blanks). All dedicated Satanists should be practicing power meditation and learning Satanic Healing Techniques. I have had much success with the above and other healing techniques I have written about on this website. The power to heal is a wonderful gift from Satan. Any dedicated Satanist who practices meditation regularly can do this. Things are getting very bad in the world and will get much worse. Those of us who are adept and and apply Satanic knowledge will survive these times intact. 479"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Invoking the Elements Invoking the elements is very advanced and can be very dangerous. I am speaking from experience here. There are many authors who write from a theoretical and scholastic prospective and have not had the direct experience with certain meditations and psychic practices. I am going to give you *my* personal experiences with the meditations that follow. Remember- THESE ARE MY OWN DIRECT EXPERIENCES AND SOME OF WHAT I EXPERIENCED, YOU MAY OR MAY NOT AS WE ARE INDIVIDUALS, BUT THESE MEDITATIONS *ARE* HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS. If you: • Are not physically and/or mentally healthy • If you take *any* psychiatric medications or medications that affect your brain/nervous system • If you suffer from High Blood Pressure • If you have heat flashes from menopause • If you suffer bouts of depression • If you do not know yourself 100% • If you are pregnant I strongly encourage you to turn back and work other meditations that are safer. Once you have overcome any problems mentioned above using safer meditations, you can proceed at a very slow pace if you think you are ready. Let me explain: With invoking the elements, here are some examples of what can happen: Invoking fire will make you hot. Depending on how many breaths you do (only seven and under are recommended for those who have not had experience with this element). Even with adepts, 20 breaths can be extreme. While you are doing the fire meditation for the first time, more than likely while you are doing it, you will feel little or nothing. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING ANY MORE BREATHS BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FEEL NOTHING! You will feel the effects hours later. The effects of invoking fire include a fever, feeling BURNING HOT after a warm glow/aura manifests, insomnia and since water is the opposite of fire, you can get a backlash of water and this can manifest in depression. These effects can last several hours to several days. Each one of us has imbalances of certain elements and invoking the elements can cause even more imbalance so it is also important to know your strengths and weaknesses in certain elements. Invoking air can overstimulate the nervous system. Air can make you very irritable and oversensitive for a few hours to several days, depending on how much you take in. I have always been a person of extremes and I am daring, so I have never put any limitations on myself with meditations, though I have always used common sense. Now, with invoking these elements over a period of time, we become resistant to extremes of temperature, we can warm or cool our bodies at will and we can be adept at pyrokinesis, cryokinesis and other astral disciplines. If you are planning to do the elemental meditations, I strongly encourage you to keep written entries in a black book or journal regarding how these exercises affect you. Mastering the elements is one of the highest forms of magick, while others play around with props. The elements are based upon the four 480"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"corners and directions. They are the foundation of the universe when working magick. Invoking and directing the elements is used to empower sigils and talismans. Each ritual or working normally has an elemental theme. By making use of the elements the power of any working is drastically amplified. Elemental magick is extremely advanced and powerful magick. There are two ways of invoking the elements. One way is total invocation as I have done (no breathing them back out and the most dangerous) and the other way is easier is to breathe the element back out into the ether. You can work up from this. Each one of us has strengths and weaknesses with certain elements. Nearly all of us have imbalances of the elements in our souls. The following meditations will correct these. Several hours or a day after invoking an element, sit quietly and meditate on how you feel. How did you feel during the past 24 hours? It is important to be able to *feel* the elements in order to direct and control them. To properly invoke, direct, and control the elements, you must be balanced in all of the elements. Most of us have imbalances. These can usually be seen in our astrology charts. Those of us who progress and continue on will be working You must be honest with yourself and know yourself. The articles below in the advanced section reveal the elements in their pure form. Very few of us are imbalanced with just one element; usually there are two that are dominant. Look to the elements where most of the characteristics describe you. By balancing your elements, you will find healing physically, psychologically, at the soul level and mentally. Fire is opposite Water and Air is opposite Earth. The opposite element is what is needed to fix the imbalance. It is important to be aware that invoking the lacking element can create a temporary backlash in the over-dominant element. 481"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Fire The Characteristics of Fire: Self-centered, confident, enthusiastic, expressive, bold, subjective, expansive, out-going, extroverted, insensitivity to others, impulsive, impatient, creative, vain, extravagant, reckless, passionate, self- important, exhibitionist, courageous, adventuresome.

There are often problems in dealing with others; they can be very insensitive and crude in their approach. Fire people are prone to inflammation, high blood pressure and can be labeled as \"hot headed\" as they normally have short tempers. Without the element of earth, people who are dominant in fire lack staying power. People who are lacking in fire are usually low in energy, lack self-esteem, and self-confidence. There is a lack of spiritedness, lack of enthusiasm, aversion to challenges; there is apathy toward living, major problems take a long time to overcome with lingering psychological scars. Fire alleviates mental depression and brings a love of life. Fire is the creative principle, the spark of life. Fire rules competition, athletics, action, courage, self-confidence, charisma, and pyrokinesis. Invoking and directing fire is the advanced aspect of pyrokinesis. TO INVOKE FIRE , go into a light to medium trance and visualize yourself in the middle of a large sphere of fire. Now, do the energy breathing. Breath in the fire from all sides of your body, front, back, top of your head and bottom of your feet. Imagine and feel yourself getting burning hot. Do this for seven breaths AND ONLY SEVEN BREATHS ! DO NOT DO ANY MORE! YOU CAN EVEN DO AS LITTLE AS 2-3 BREATHS, BUT NO MORE THAN SEVEN! You have two options for this exercise: 1. You can breathe the fire back out into the ether after each inhaliation and even breath it out some more when you are finished with the seven breaths (This is the safest way) OR 2. You can retain the fire. With retention of the elements, you will progress faster, understand how each element feels and affects you and increase your ability to handle each element, but remember- this is not for everyone. It is better to take things slower and use caution. Remember to always use common sense. To be adept, one must master blowing (directing the exhale) the element out as we will in following meditations. For example, blowing out the element of fire after you have invoked enough of it and your body can withstand high amounts of this element, you can raise the temperature of objects and even set them on fire, using only your mind. Unlike the other method of pyrokinesis on this website, with the above, you can even be miles from your object. Invoking fire will make you hot. Depending on how many breaths you do (only seven and under are recommended for those who have not had experience with this element). Even with adepts, 20 breaths can be extreme. While you are doing the fire meditation for the first time, more than likely while you are doing it, you will feel little or nothing. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING ANY MORE BREATHS BECAUSE YOU MIGHT FEEL NOTHING! More than likely, you will feel the effects hours later. The effects of invoking fire include a fever, feeling BURNING HOT after a warm glow/aura manifests, insomnia and since water is the opposite of fire, you can get a backlash of water and this can manifest in depression. These effects can last several hours to several days. 482"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Earth Characteristics of Earth: People who are dominant in earth are sensual, materialistic, practical, and they hate anything that is unplanned. Earth gives patience, self-discipline, makes one dependable, reliable, and conventional. Earth people like tradition, and security is extremely important to them, they are cautious, deliberate, slow in forming opinions, and slow in everything they do. They are reserved, have limited imaginations, but they have exceptional endurance. They are practical, grounded, and level-headed. They are hard working, they dislike change and can be stuck in a routine for years without ever getting bored. They have a hard time adjusting to new situations and changes. A LACK OF EARTH: People who are lacking in earth are not attuned to the material/physical world, they are spaced-out, impractical, they can neglect their bodies, they are flighty, lack self-discipline, are ungrounded, often feel out of place, and have over-active imaginations. These people can forget to eat, rest, exercise and so forth. They have trouble with routine, endurance, scheduling and organizing their lives. A lack of earth brings a lack of stability along with an inability to finish things. Here today and gone tomorrow. These people can overspend their money foolishly or gamble it away. They are irresponsible and live only for today. Earth is the material principle. INVOKING EARTH: To invoke the earth element, go into a light to medium trance and visualize yourself in the middle of a large sphere of heavy dense gravity. Now, do the energy breathing.

They can be very impractical. Air lacks feeling and emotion. Air is pure intellect. Air people can adapt and adjust to situations easily. They can have an over-active mind, live in their head, and be Jack-Of- All-Trades, and master of none. Air lacks depth. The sayings \"up in the air\" \"air headed\", \"cool headed\" are relevant to air. An imbalance of too much air creates a lack of planning, makes one scatterbrained, nervousness, high-strung, and causes nervous exhaustion. A LACK of air makes one have a hard time detaching as the tendency is to become too emotionally involved. People who lack air find themselves too involved with others. They can be overly emotional, have violent reactions, lash out, and have a very difficult time with being objective. They can have a hard time adjusting to new situations. The emotions often dominate in one who is lacking the air element. They can become obsessed. Air is the communicative, intellectual principle. INVOKING AIR: Sit quietly and go into a light to medium trance. Now, imagine yourself in the air. Feel the lightness and breathe in the air element. It is important to imagine yourself feeling lighter and lighter and airy. Imagine that your body is becoming lighter, as light as air itself to where you can no longer feel your body.

Water is intuitive, over- reactive, fearful, timid, gives feelings of inner emptiness. and incites extremes of behavior. Water is compassionate, loyal, devoted, and sympathetic. Water is the emotional principle. A LACK OF WATER: People who are lacking in water are not in touch with their feelings.

This will feel like floating. There is no above or below or sideways. This unlimited space is filled with the finest energetic matter, the universal ether. Ether is colorless, but to our senses it appears to be of ultra-violet, near black-violet color, and this is the color in which we imagine the etheric matter. 2. Breathe in the akasha/ether, visualizing yourself surrounded by the black-violet energy as you would with energy breathing and fill your entire being with it for eleven breaths. In performing this exercise, you have to retain the feeling of being united to the entire infinite space. You have to be as it were completely secluded from the world. It is necessary to become acquainted with this unusual state of mind.\" *For those of you who are familiar with the black lights of the 1970's and how they illuminated florescent colors on posters, this is the color you should be visualizing as it is very powerful. Black lights are ultra-violet. 3. Meditate on the feeling you get from invoking this energy for 10-15 minutes. \"It has been mentioned in the theoretical part that the elements originate in the akasha principle, by which they are dominated and kept in the correct balance. After a long time of exercising, a magician who has achieved good results with the elements will also be able to control the finest principle that is the astral ether.\" \"We have heard that akasha is the primary source, the sphere of all causes. Any deliberate cause, such as a wish, a thought, any imagination created in this sphere together with the dynamic conviction is bound to be realized with the help of the elements, regardless of the level or sphere on which the realization necessarily has to be performed. This is one of the greatest magic mysteries and a universal key for the magician, who will understand its range only later on in the course of his development.\" -Franz Bardon \"Initiation into Hermetics\" © 1956 Aether (classical element) (Redirected from Quintessence (alchemy)) \"The aether is the fifth classical element in ancient Greek philosophy and science. This Greek concept seems to derive directly from the akasha, its Hindu counterpart. In Greek doctrines it seems that the aether was the celestial fire, the pure essence where the gods lived and which they breathed. In this connection, it seems that aether is radiative heat like that of the sun, which is able to propagate in empty space. The Greek word \"aither\" derives from an Indo- European root aith- (\"burn, shine\"). This root figures in the name of Aithiopia (Ethiopia), which means something like \"burnt land.\" \"Aether was once believed to be a substance, which filled all of space. Aristotle included it as a fifth element (the quintessence) on the principle that nature abhorred a vacuum.\" Oliver Nicholson points out that, in contrast to the better known luminiferous aether of the 19th century, the older concept of the classical aether had three properties. Among these characteristics, the classical aether had a non-material property, was \"less than the vehicle of visible light\", and was responsible for \"generating metals\" along with fostering the development of all bodies.\" [1]\"Robert Fludd stated that the aether was of the character that it was \"subtler than light\". Fludd cites the 3rd century view of Plotinus, concerning the aether as penetrative and non-material.\" \"[2]\"Other 1800s views, such as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Nikola Tesla, was of the disposition that the aether was more akin to it actually being the electromagnetic field.\" \"In modern physics, dark energy is sometimes called quintessence due to its similarity to the classical ether.\" 486"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Meditation to Produce Heat The sushumna is the line the kundalini travels up the spine. It is very small in diameter. Tibetan monks would be tested for initiation by stripping down naked, wrapping themselves in a wet sheet, and spending the night in the freezing mountains, sitting in the snow. In the morning, if the initiate passed the test, the sheet would be bone dry and several feet of snow around the monk would be melted. Expanding the sushumna is used to raise body temperature and create heat. This power can also be applied to pyrokinesis (setting objects on fire with the power of the mind). While in a trance, visualize the sushumna expanding to the spine in either a red hot or white hot glowing light. Focus on this for several minutes and from there, expand it beyond the spine, again, focus for several minutes and then expand it 2 inches beyond the spine. Keep expanding until you are several feet or more beyond your physical body. This meditation produces a lot of heat, especially when done regularly. When practiced on a frequent basis, one can expect a rise in body temperature. 487"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Telekinesis Telekinesis is the ability of the mind to move objects, through concentration. This is very advanced and you will need a very powerful aura. We all have this ability, but due to centuries of xian generational suppression of the powers of the mind, it is a part of our brain that is now dormant. Like learning a gymnastics maneuver, with getting the *feel* for it and using it, it will become easier and easier with time, dedication and patience. Everything on this Earth contains an energy field or aura, even inanimate objects. With performing telekinesis, you must connect your aura with aura of the object you intend to move. The strength of your aura will determine your success. The following exercises help in developing telekinesis. You should be experienced with energy manipulation and have powerful hand chakras. In order to work up to this, the Foundation Meditation and the hand chakra meditation should be mastered. This exercise is best done after power meditation when your aura is strong. 1. To begin, suspend a pendulum in front of you. This can be any object from a small pencil or a light ball, like a ping pong ball. Anything small, light and even will work. It must be in front of you, preferably over a table, where you can relax and sit. Hang the pendulum, so nothing is touching it or coming into physical contact with it and so it can move easily and freely. 2. Place your hands about an inch on each side of the pendulum, palms facing the pendulum. Direct energy through your palm chakras. 3. Now try pushing and pulling. You will see your aura pushing and pulling the object. One hand pushes, the other pulls. Visualize your aura connecting with the aura of the pendulum. Do not move your hands. When you are able to move the pendulum, place your hands farther and farther apart. The next step is to move the pendulum using the energy from your fingertips. At first, try to pull it with the energy from your fingert ips. The key is to keep distancing yourself from the object. The next step, which is extremely advanced is to begin using the powers of your third eye and move objects by connecting your aura with that of the object and willing them to move. Do not get frustrated. This takes intense concenration, a strong mind and aura, but with enough patience and practice, the time you succeed in moving the object will become shorter and shorter. When you learn to use this area of your brain and strengthen it (it will become easier and easier), the first few times are the most difficult. It may take several sessions, sometimes even weeks, but it is not impossible. Here are some practicle tips: 1. It definitely helps to be able to see auras. When we open our third eye, this gives us the ability, but we must learn to use this ability to see. This is analagous to athletics. If one has the strength and flexibility, the potential is there, all one needs to do is the movement to get the feel and to train the movement into muscle memory. It is the same with the mind. 2. Start out with light objects. Gemstones such as quartz crystals are great, provided they are small and light. These have a stronger aura of their own. 3. Telekinesis is best attempted after power meditation when one's energy is most radiant. 4. Telekinesis like any other skill should be worked on daily until mastered. Heavier and heavier objects can replace the lighter ones as proficiency is achieved. I have had success with the above method. 488"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Pyrokinesis Pyrokinesis is the ability to control, ignite and extinguish fire, using the powers of one's mind. This is dangerous. One should be adept and very experienced in handling and directing energy, as inexperience can cause dangerous burns to yourself, even though you may have a powerful aura. An exceptionally powerful aura is necessary for pyrokinetic ability. 1. Begin by lighting a candle. 2. In order to do this safely, you should be adept at putting fires out before igniting them. Position both of your hands, palms facing inward about half an inch from each side of the candle flame and direct your energy into the flame, willing it to die out. This is extremely advanced and you must have a powerful aura. Try concentrating on black energy between your palms where the flame should be. 3. To ignite a flame: perform the Heat Meditation, and direct the energy you produce to your palm chakras. 4. Blow out the candle. Position both of your hands, palms facing inward about half an inch from each side of the candle wick, which should be an ember. 5. Direct energy from your palm chakras and concentrate intense heat on the ember and will it to ignite. Try concentrating on white hot energy, between your palms. The ember, with practice will begin to glow brighter and eventually, will ignite. 6. Put out the flame, concentrate the energy between your palms on the ember of the wick and direct it to ignite the flame again. With enough palm chakra energy and concentration, it will relight. 7. As you advance, move your palms farther and farther apart. 8. When you are proficient with your palms 2-3 feet apart, concentrate on lighting the wick of the candle without the ember. Ignite the cold wick. In addition to using the energy from your palm chakras, you are using the powers from your third eye. The third eye has a direct line of energy to the physical eyes where the energy projects. Once you are adept at the above exercise, try using less and less of your hands. Again, it is important to put fires out before learning to ignite them. Expand your aura to connect with the candle flame. The candle should be a foot or less in front of you. Connect your aura and put out the flame. Once you are adept, do the same and ignite the ember. When you are able to use only your aura to light the candle flame, expand your aura to connect with an object a foot or less in front of you and project the heat as you did with your palms. As you progress, keep moving the object farther and farther away. Instead of just doing void meditation, the above exercises can be substituted as they require intense, unwavering concentration. 489"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"How to Detach Unwanted People/Entities from Your Aura People in our lives, especially those of whom we have emotions for - either positive or negative, are attached to our aura. Normally, we are attached at the chakras. These attachments can last for many lifetimes. They are most common in family members and those who are close to us. There is another kind of attachment and that is what is called \"psychic vampirism.\" Psychic vampirism is when another person attaches him/herself astrally to your soul and the relationship is of detriment. He/she usually attaches at one or more of your chakras and drains your energy. In all close relationships, there is a mutual soul attachment for better or worse. In the case of a psychic vampire, the relationship is analogous to that of a parasite and a host. A psychic vampire does not even have to be involved in a relationship, as it is natural for his/her aura to feed off of the auras of others. There are symptoms of psychic attachment, the most pronounced are thoughts and/or feelings that are not your own. Your energy eventually becomes depleted, especially when you are around the psychic vampire. Whether they are physically near to you or at a distance, once a psychic vampire has attached him/herself to your aura, they can drain you. Psychic vampires are rarely strangers. in many cases, this can even be a family member. A good example is with love/sexual relationships. Following a break up, one party may not want to let go. Another case is that with obsession. Obsession is a bit different as the obsessed person is actually *giving* energy to the object of his/her obsession. This is where a psychic vampire enters into an ideal situation. There is a constant and willing supply of energy from the obsessed individual that the vampire benefits from. In almost all cases of psychic vampirism, there is a weakness on the part of the host person. This weakness is usually of an emotional nature. The parasite/host relationship often satisfying an unfulfilled need for one or both of the individuals involved. The attaching person's energy feeds off this. In ridding ourselves of this influence, we must acknowledge that a problem exists and WANT to let go. If the host subconsciously does not want to let go, this exercise will be useless. 490"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"To remove an unwanted person from your aura: 1. During the cycle of a waning moon, (a few days after the full moon; and a few days before the new moon) find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. 2. Relax and enter into a deep trance, for this working, the deeper the trance, the better. Now ask your mind to reveal anyone who has an inappropriate tie. (You can also ask your mind this before you fall asleep at another time, and this will be revealed in a dream). (If you know who it is beforehand, you can visualize them). If there are several, then work with one person at a time. This working can be time consuming. It is best to work with one person per session. You should allow yourself a few days in- between sessions ideally so your aura can adjust and your energies can rebound. Depending upon the strength of the bond, the working may have to be repeated. 3. Ask your mind where the connection(s) is. You may find that a mutual connection exists, where there are two or more attachments at the chakras. Take as much time as you need, using an astral knife, cutter, laser, or whatever you are comfortable working with, and dislodge the connections completely on both sides. 4. Place the connections in a pile as you work. Your will must be strong here, as the other person may not want to let go. Seal the areas on your aura where these connections were attached with healing light/energy, white/gold is the most powerful, but use whatever color you are comfortable with, as we are all individuals. You don’t want any injuries or holes left in your aura. 5. If you care for the other person, you can heal and seal his/her holes made by the detachments. 6. Invoke the element of fire and build an astral fire with this, by directing it, and burn all of the detachment strands. When you are finished, clean your aura. When you are ready, open your eyes, get up slowly and move around, do something physical- eat, exercise, or whatever to ground yourself. 491"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Freeing the Soul With knowledge and power, one can supersede so-called \"karma.\" We are all well aware of reincarnation, many of the people in your life, for good or ill, you have known before, especially family members. These relationships can last many lifetimes. Some of them have a negative effect on us and are destructive to our growth and wellbeing. The same negative relationship is repeated over and over, back and forth, in different ways, times and bodies. The good news is, with the proper knowledge and taking appropriate action using this knowledge, we can remove these negative people from our lives; thus setting ourselves and the offending ones free from the control of the evil will of malignant powers. To begin, enter into a trance and go back through your lifetime, as early as you can remember. Write down the persons involved in every negative/destructive relationship you have ever experienced in your life. Leave the positive/beneficial relationships out of this, as these are people we want to continue with. Negative people can include parents and in many cases, siblings, relatives, schoolteachers, former friends, enemies, spouses, lovers, and/or people who have used you or harmed you in any lasting way, either physically or psychologically. Family relationships are the most powerful, this includes spouses and significant others. Take your time with this exercise. You can always go back and add more names to the list as old memories surface. Negative karmic relationships are something we need to cut from our lives. Remember when you judge each relationship, that no relationship is perfect. The most negative relationships will be obvious and you can soon go to work on them. If there is any serious repressed anger that cannot be dealt with, outside of retribution, then perform the appropriate revenge ritual(s). Get it over with in the here and now and be sure to vent everything. This will act as a cathartic and is very therapeutic. You will then be able to heal emotionally and psychologically. It is best to perform the working during a waning Moon. The Moon should *NOT* be in the signs of Cancer, or Libra, nor should it be void of course. Others attach themselves to your soul via strands resembling those with astral projection. They are NOT all \"silver,\" as most popular books lead people to believe. I have seen gold and bronze colored strands and there may be even more colors, so assume nothing. Perform the Detaching exercise to remove these ties. Make good and sure, the other person (as well as yourself) is completely sealed off when you remove the attachment. Don't try to do more than one person per session. Start with the worst individuals, living or deceased. If you don't know whether they are dead or alive, it doesn't matter. When you are finished, clean your aura. Different people are best dealt with each with different sessions. At the end, you should feel lighter, freer and at peace. Thank Father Satan at the end of each session.

When our chakras vibrate at a higher rate, this helps to protect us from misfortune and disease. It also opens us to the astral and protects us astrally as well as in the physical world.

For adepts, organs other than the brain or heart are usually able to handle condensed elements. The organs are not the chakras, as some have confused these in the e-groups. Breathing in elements into your chakras is fine. 495"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"Evoking the Elements When your goals are personal and pertain to yourself, this is the time to invoke energy and project it from yourself. Evoking energy is different. When spells are for others, it is important to evoke energy as energy that you project from yourself will establish a connection with the person you send it to. Both in cursing and healing, for obvious reasons, this is undesirable. The energy you use must be taken from the universe. It is very important to master both evocation and invocation of the elements in order to progress to advanced levels of ability. Evoking Fire Get into a trance and visualize you are in the middle of fire. Feel the heat and hear the hissing and crackling of the flames and feel the burning. Now, begin to collect and condense that fire into a sphere in front of you. Draw the fire element from all directions into the sphere in front of you. The more of the fire element you direct into the sphere, the more dense, material, and hotter it will become. You should feel the heat while you are doing this. The more you compress and condense the fire, the more the heat will grow. You should actually have the sensation of literally being in an oven. Now dissolve the sphere of fire by visualizing it dissipating – the exact opposite of when you brought it together. Keep working at visualizing it dissipating, losing its strength, power and heat and eventually dissolving into nothing. Evoking Air Get into a trance and visualize you are in the middle of air, fill the entire room with it. Draw the air from all directions simultaneously into a sphere in front of you. Fill and pack the sphere with the air element. You should feel very light, as though you are floating. When you are finished packing the air into the sphere, dissolve it as you did with the fire sphere. Evoking Water Get into a trance and visualize you are in the middle of an ocean or lake. Draw the water element from all directions. Feel the water at first as a cold vapor, the closer you draw it to your body, as you condense the water more and more, you should feel icy cold. Now, pack the water element into a sphere in front of you and then dissolve it, the same as you did with the fire and air. Let it evaporate away into nothingness. Evoking Earth Get into a trance and draw a gray mass, similar to clay, from all directions simultaneously. The closer you bring it to yourself, it becomes browner and browner, rich like soil and more dense. Fill the room entirely with the heavy mass of the earth element and visualize it compacting into a sphere. Feel the heaviness and the gravity and its pressure on your body. When finished, dissolve it as you did with the other elements. Evoke the element of fire again, but this time, have a glass of tepid water in front of you and draw the fire from all directions and condense it into the glass of water. It is best to use a clear glass with this exercise. Imagine the water getting hotter and hotter with the fire element. If you are successful, the water will increase in temperature by a few degrees.

Later on, when you find you can raise the temperature of tepid water, then work with colder and colder water and practice the same. 496"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Rotating the Elements Rotating the elements is very advanced. One should already be adept with circulating energy through the chakras. One of the most important steps in advanced meditation is to circulate the elements through each of the chakras. This is very advanced and is done after condensing the element into a chakra it rules, and then circulating it. Work on mastering each one. You should definitely FEEL the element- i.e., searing hot for fire, ice cold for water, heavy for earth, and light for air. Quintessence is warm to hot. This is very advanced and should only be attempted by experienced meditators. This will provide an important foundation for more advanced works of which I will soon be posting here. The ancients used the seasons to facilitate their workings. This is a part of the four points. Summer is hot and meditating on and invoking the element of fire is easier for beginners. Just make sure you have a place to cool down. Spring is a good time to work with air, fall is great for earth, and winter is good for working with water, as it is cold. The next step should be combining the elements, such as circulating water after circulating fire and then circulating quintessence. This is all very powerful. The waxing and full moon acts to transform the fiery rays of the sun into the element of water. Energy from both the Sun and Moon should also be invoked and circulated. For example- rotating the element of fire 1. Breathe in the element of fire into your entire body. 2. Condense the fire into a small ball inside your base chakra. 3. Now, direct that ball into your sacral chakra, then your solar chakra, your throat chakra, your third eye, your crown chakra and then down from your crown chakra into your 6th chakra behind your third eye and to the back of your head- through the rear sixth chakra and on down your spine at each chakra. Take your time with this, burning each of your chakras thoroughly. This is very empowering and cleansing. 4. When finished, either direct the fire ball to your base chakra or expell it through your solar plexus chakra. Do the same with the other elements, including the qunitessence. Doing this with the chi or pineal secretions is also very powerful AND pleasurable. In the beginning, you should only work with and master one element per meditation session. Fire can also be invoked from the sun- the hotter the sun, the better. 497"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"Splitting the Soul These meditations are extremely advanced and can be dangerous to newbies. One should be experienced in meditation, energy manipulation, invoking the elements and in understanding of what he/she is doing on the astral level. To begin with any of these meditations, one must be thoroughly relaxed. Being disturbed by others, loud noises, the phone ringing, visitors or anything else, including being touched by animals can be dangerous. MEDITATING UPON THE AURA: 1. To sense and feel your aura: expand your awareness out past your physical self a few inches and sense your aura's energy. 2. FEEL your aura and meditate upon it for a few minutes. 3. Expand and contract your aura. 4. Breathe energy into and out of your aura. 5. If you feel you are ready, you can invoke each of the elements into your aura. These should be done slowly, no more than seven breaths to begin with. It is best to only go with one element per day. 6. Meditate on the feeling of each element after invoking into your aura. 7. If you feel uncomfortable, just breathe the element back out. MEDITATING UPON THE LIGHT BODY: 1. The light body can be felt by expanding your awareness to the energy within your body. This can be felt. 2. FEEL your light body and meditate upon this. 3. Breathe in energy into and out of your light body. 498"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"3 rd Eye, Pineal Breathing Meditation What this meditation does is it puts pressure on your third eye or pineal gland, which will further open and empower whichever one you are focusing on. This meditation is advanced and not for beginners. You should have enough experience to where you fully understand the directions below with no problem. 1. Breathe in energy from the base of your spine up to your throat chakra. 2. Hold as long as comfortable and focus on either your third eye or pineal gland. You should feel a pressure, ache, or even slight pain. 3. Exhale and repeat for a number of times. Before you begin this meditation or any other for that matter, you should plan ahead what your meditation will consist of. In this case, whether you will focus on your pineal gland or third eye. I have done both in that I began the meditation focusing on my third eye and then on my pineal gland for the second half. Eventually, when you fully open and activate your pineal gland, your head will be full of light. This is extremely powerful and very pleasurable. This light is very powerful for manifesting your desires when properly directed. The sensation from the pineal gland when it is activated is incredible and beyond words. It is exceptionally pleasurable and lasts for hours when one is still and intuned. 499"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"The Magnum Opus Satan told me he will be giving me the formula to the Magnum Opus.

The aura, the light body, the chakras, the etherial double, (the ghost that takes on the image of the physical body), and the intelligence/consciousness. The human soul is also made up of the elements fire, earth, air, water and quintessence. In doing research, I have found major discrepancies among authors as to the specific aspects of the KA, the BA, the AKH and the SAHU- the parts of soul as defined by the Ancient Egyptians. From what I can gather, the real meaning of the Egyptian concept of the \"REN\" is the individual vibration of the soul. This has to do with the Egyptian Kabalah (KA BA AKH). The original Kabalah was Egyptian and the purpose was meditation upon the different aspects of the soul, both seperately and together in combinations. This is very, very advanced. The human soul can at will be divided during meditation. This is what occurs with deliberate astral projection or involuntary \"out of the body\" experiences. Just as the soul can be divided, it can be reunited at will. The soul can be merged with the soul of another person. The aura can be expended and contracted at will. It can be programmed to attract or repel anything at will. The aura can be programmed by will to act upon the aura of another for better or worse. Each aspect of the soul can be meditated upon seperately and empowered. Each aspect can invoke and hold each of the elements. This is very advanced and can be dangerous if one does not know what one is doing. The images below illustrate two main parts of the soul. Bear in mind, the light body is shapeless. Though both illustrations are white light, these bodies can be of any color and can change color as to moods, health, emotions and so forth. They can also be of more than one color. The above, I write from my own direct experiences and not theory. 501"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"Wings of the Soul All souls have wings, even those of animals.

The ancient symbol of the Caduceus shown above is used by the American Medical Association and also the single serpent Caduceus is used for veterinary medicine. Learning to move these wings and control them is a part of advancing the soul. When we advance in meditation, they will appear to us, often unexpectedly. 502"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"Basic Meditation Program When one is new to power meditation, it is important to start out with a program. There are many different meditations on this site for different effects. A basic meditation program should consist of Void Meditation as this helps us in controlling unwanted thoughts and with directing our minds. Breathing exercises are essential to any meditation program. The Foundation Meditation is a very important meditation as it helps us to learn to feel and absorb energy, which is very important in working magick. If you are new, it is best to start out with basic white light. White light is easy to use because it contains all of the colors of the spectrum. With experience, you can advance to working with colors for specific things. Color energy is very powerful. Chakra work should be included in each meditation session as this is necessary to empower your aura and soul. I have found directed orgasm to be very effective in opening the chakras. Orgasm is a good way to open a meditation, as it is naturally relaxing. If your chakras are blocked, simply direct the energy during your climax, up your spine to the specific chakra. Visualize it as a stream of bright light in the same color as the chakra you are trying to open, and simultaneously visualize the blocked chakra opening and the energy flowing through it. This can take months, but in time, a permanent circuit will be established. The EZ Chakra Spin is fine to start out with before advancing to meditations that are more powerful. Remember, we are all individuals and where one person may experience pleasure and positive results for a specific meditation, another may not. Always go by the way you feel. If one meditation doesn’t feel right then stop and try another meditation. Meditation sessions should ideally last for 15 – 30 minutes a day. If you are short on time, doing just 5- 10 minutes is better than doing nothing. Skipping days will throw you behind and when you are new, inconsistency can cause depression as your body tries to adjust to the increased bioelectricity. Aura Cleaning should also be done daily. This only takes a couple of minutes and in the long run, it prevents any negative energy from attaching itself to your aura. Negative energy causes accidents, sickness, and depression. Meditation programs should be changed every so often. An indication your program needs changing is when you no longer feel any progress. As long as you are comfortable with a certain program and make advances, there is no need to change, unless you get bored. The objective of meditation is both to empower yourself and to learn to handle energy. Power meditation opens the energy centers (chakras) in the soul. The chakras contain a lot of hidden energy. Each chakra has specific energies that open different areas of the mind. The chakras also give us supernatural abilities when open and fully empowered, like levitation, telekinesis (moving objects with your mind), and pyrokinesis (the ability to heat objects and set them on fire). Many more abilities come with having powerful chakras. When all of your chakras are fully open, this creates a free passage for the serpent of fire (Kundalini) which is at the base of your spine. When the kundalini ascends, we become as the Gods. This is the objective of power meditation. 503"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"Overcoming Obstacles If you have been consistently putting your energies into something that hasn't manifested, or has manifested in a much different way than you intended, it is important to find out why. In addition, it is very important to *really* want what you are working towards. Make sure what you are putting your energies into is what you really want. Look to what kinds of changes getting what you desire will create in your life. Make sure you are totally ok with the changes. In some cases, subconscious barriers such as fear of change, or something else that will result from your attaining you desire, can ruin a working, even if you aren't aware of this consciously. It is important to really know yourself. Common reasons for failure in magick are: • Not having enough personal spiritual power to obtain the focus of the working. The more power your soul/spirit has, the more easily you will obtain what you want. This is analogous to the physical self, lifting or moving something. If you are not strong enough, it can be very difficult to impossible. The same applies to working magick. • Due to a lack of awareness, you destroy what you are trying to create. What I mean by this is repeating certain phrases over and over, that are contrary to what you are trying to achieve. Every cell in our body is a thinking living unit that makes up the part of the whole. This is what is referred to as the \"mind-body.\" There is a very powerful connection here. You ARE what you think, ESPECIALLY, if you practice power meditation and/or have a more powerful soul. By phrases, I am referring to: \"My ulcers, my flu, my heart condition.....etc. DON'T *OWN* THE FUCKING DISEASE!!!!! How many times a day do you hear people repeating and repeating this negativity?? How can you expect to heal and get well when you OWN the disease???? Instead, say \"THE ulcers, \"THE flu\"......Get it??? Don't own ANY disease. • Don't use body language. One man kept saying, “I’d give my right arm if...” Yes, it was a figure of speech, but he lost his arm in a car accident and what he stated ironically came true. Now, most average everyday people can say and think what they please and otherwise as their minds are not powerful and little if anything results from their thoughts. This is not the case with people who have stronger auras, through either power meditation and/or from past lives. Be aware of what you think and what you say. • Detach yourself from the disease/illness. You have to be 100% that you don't want it, and you certainly don't need it. I have read in New Age books where scum of the toilet authors tell readers to \"love their disease.\" THAT IS THE MOST SUICIDAL ADVICE THERE IS!! I am appalled at how those idiot fools with their xianized, corrupted, and desecrated \"witchcraft\" put limitation after limitation in their way and train others to do so because of downright FEAR and STUPIDITY! THAT IS SICK!! As for \"karma\" ALL karma can be overcome through KNOWLEDGE and the APPLICATION OF THAT KNOWLEDGE! 504"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"Satan gives us that very knowledge. • Don't keep saying \"I don't have any money\" \"I can't afford it\" \"I am broke\" etc. Even if it is true, don't keep reinforcing this, especially if you are working towards money coming to you. Instead, say to yourself, \"HOW can I afford this?\" Meaning, where there is a will, there is a way and solution to affording it. Turn negative statements around and counteract them with \"Lots of free and easy money is coming to me easily and effortlessly\" for example. As for the above example, instead of saying \"I can't afford it\" for something you really want to own, instead, say- \"This is mine.\" Remember, affirmations should always be said in the present tense. Other obstacles include unconscious hang-ups and barriers. With this sort of thing, you first off, have to know yourself. Reasons and life experiences are individual here and as numerous as the stars. The first step in overcoming the problem here is to ask your mind- why? \"Why isn't this working the way I want it to?\" \"Why am I not healing\"? \"Why isn't money coming to me?\" and so forth. Some people have hang-ups that go way back into early childhood or even previous lifetimes. Finding the underlying cause of your problem and knowing what the problem IS, and you are already half-way to solving it. If the problem involves another person, then you have to work there and dissolve the obstacle(s) before stepping up to the main working. If you know what the obstacle is, then put your meditations and energies into destroying this obstacle. For example, if you are hung up on punishing yourself from childhood or whatever, you can put your energies into undoing this, for example, going into a trance and filling yourself full of positive energy and affirming, \"I am free from punishing myself. I forgive myself\" (in cases where you are carrying a lot of guilt). For those of us who have studied astrology and such in depth, we know most often, fate has a hand in tragedy. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people...etc., Some people have lived their lives carrying around guilt and punishing themselves for something that wasn't their fault. This is not always the case, but the deal is, if you want to be successful in healing or any other kind of magick where you attract what you desire, you cannot have self-hatred for obvious reasons! If there are obstacles, then work your magick to destroy those obstacles before you work on the main goal(s). One all-purpose affirmation is: \"Any and all obstacles preventing me from having__________, are being destroyed and completely dissolved.\" In closing, as I mentioned before, the more powerful your aura/soul are, the easier it is to get what you want with lesser effort and time. I speak from experience here, where personal power is concerned. Performing so-called \"miracles\" only requires a powerful soul/aura and the knowledge to use it. HAIL SATAN!! - High Priestess Maxine Dietrich 505"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"Fighting Back One of the most important reasons we clean our auras is to get off all of the negative energy that we encounter on a daily basis. Much of this comes from others in our immediate environment. The workplace can be especially troublesome as well as the home for many. Negative people include those who forever whine and complain, but do nothing to try to alleviate their situations, those who are forever putting others down to make themselves feel better or to divert their attentions from their own personal worthlessness, those who blame everyone else for their woes, those who take out their anger and frustrations through abusing others and the list goes on and on. Satanists do not take abuse. There is a very simple meditation one who is experiencing the effects of another’s negative output can do: 1. Clean your aura and chakras thoroughly, as you do not want to trap in any negative energy 2. Expand your consciousness to your aura and *feel* your aura 3. Relax and tune into your aura 4. Visualize your aura as an outline and protective barrier. The outline should be brilliant white light like the Sun because white light deflects everything. 5. State this affirmation: “My aura is powerfully and totally deflecting ___(name of offender)’s____ negative energy in every way and sending it directly back to him/her. “ This meditation should be done with intent and then repeated when you come into contact with the offensive asshole. Just visualize and feel your aura, same as above and repeat the affirmation a couple of times and watch the asshole’s negativity destroy him/her. No Satanist should ever have to put up with or take abuse. The average person absorbs the negative energy and suffers accordingly after the negativity has built up. The offending asshole benefits by venting hostility or negativity on others and often thrives on it. The people who unknowingly absorb the energy can suffer anything from depression to illness and get caught in a vortex of negative energy, while providing the asshole with a negative outlet. The above meditation puts a dead stop to this, but remember, it must be reinforced frequently. In addition to the above, visualize the negativie enery the offender is sending out, grey in color, and direct it right back to his/her aura, clinging to it. Remember to clean your aura afterwards. 506"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"More Information About Invoking the Elements Opposed to the plethora of warnings in the older meditation texts, one should gradually build their tolerance to the elements. We have found these warnings to have no more credibility than the \"three- fold\" crap. Some of us, myself included, have breathed in fire for well over 100 breaths, BUT, we worked up to this level patiently over a period of time. In order to perform fire magick with formidable intensity, one must be able to hold the fire element in large amounts and have a tolerance for it. The same goes for the other elements. One who can hold their fire element is capable of totally incinerating a victim of a black magick spell, who has no tolerance to this element. This comes in time. The Akasha/Ether/Quintessence we have found is a primer. Quintessence intensifies any working. This element is closely related to fire and when working with it on a daily basis, one will find the body temperature rises. The rise in body temperature seems to be lasting. When willing something to be, it can be imprinted in the quintessence, making it much more powerful. In absorbing the qunitessence, which is ultra-violet light, one way is to visualize a \"black light\" which was popular in the 1970's to make posters glow. The color of the black light is the color of the quintessence. 507"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Preparing Your Mind for Meditation It is important to relax both your mind and body to enter a deep trance state where your meditation will be most effective. Adepts can often enter this state easily, by will alone, even in a hectic environment. This takes time and practice, though. Remaining calm, cool and collected in threatening circumstances is one of the benefits of regular meditation. Below is a list of tips on techniques for calming and quieting your mind and body before entering into your meditation. • Hatha (physical) yoga exercises are wonderful if you have the time and discipline before beginning meditation. The energies amplified from the yoga practice and the relaxed state present a medium for focus. • Breathing exercises can be done to calm and quiet the mind before every session. Just tuning into and “watching” the breath is an excellent method of focusing one’s mind and entering the alpha state necessary for power meditation. • Listening to sounds is another way. Just blank out your thoughts and tune into the sounds in your environment. This exercise helps to create alertness as well as relaxation. • Sit or lie quietly and begin with your feet and relax your body all the way to the top of your head. • Be aware of the energy outside of your body for a few minutes and then focus on the energy inside of your body, alternating four or five times. Do this slowly and take the time to feel. This exercise creates an awareness of energy that is so important not only in securing the ability to absorb, direct and manipulate it in magickal workings, but also enhancing your awareness of others’ fields and your environment. This exercise also tones your nervous system. • Sexual orgasm is another relaxation technique that works well. Just stimulate yourself to orgasm. When opening a meditation with orgasm, use this opportunity to visualize the energy from your base chakra ascending your spine and opening your chakras. Orgasm naturally opens and cleans the chakras. You should be always be well rested when beginning a meditation session. Being tired will only cause you to fall asleep and the goals of the meditation will not be accomplished. You want to eliminate as much distracting physical stimuli as possible, unless of course, one is meditating upon pain or discomfort to strengthen the will. Make sure you are not hungry, but not overly full. When one becomes more advanced at meditation, trance states can be reached and maintained even with distractions. The mind becomes stronger and stays focused according to the will. If your mind is distracted by a pressing thought, identify the problem and tell yourself honestly to put aside the distracting thought in agreement with your mind, that the problem/thought will be confronted and dealt with after the session. You must follow through or this will not work for future sessions. To the extent you follow through is individual. 508"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Specific Meditations: Using Your Powers When using power meditations for a specific purpose, it is very important that you cover every aspect of how you want the energy to manifest in your affirmation. For example, when making an affirmation to attract money, if one only affirms for attracting money, the money may come and even be in one's hands, but this could be like a bank teller or cashier or the money may belong to or be taken by another. Get it? The mind does exactly what it is told to do and does not understand specifics unless it is *told* EXACTLY how the energy is to manifest. The easiest route is always taken by the mind and aura regardless of what that route is. This is why it is so important to be as specific in as little words as possible with your affirmations. Energy does exactly what it is told to do. The affirmations I included are a basic guide. You can use them or modify them as you see fit. Another example is with weight loss. Just affirming to lose weight is unwise. You certainly wouldn't want to lose weight through an illness like cancer. It is important to affirm \"I am losing excess and unneeded body fat in a very healthy way.\" See what I mean? This is very serious. All workings must also be able to manifest in reality. In other words, they must be physically possible. Always word affirmations in the present tense, as the right side of the brain does not understand future tense - i.e., \"will\" never happens and the mind does not understand future tense. As with all workings, you must have faith and will that what you want will manifest itself. Desire is very important! When you are finished with the meditation, no matter what the meditation is for- PUT IT OUT OF YOUR MIND! Let it work and do its job! Don't think about it or dwell on it or you will interfere with the energy. Never spread your energies thin. Work on one problem at a time. The more places your energies go, the weaker they become. Evergy should be directed like a laser. Like a computer, we can program our auras/souls for specific things and the programs will be lasting once we get them going and manifesting results. The program will stay in the aura until we remove it, if we ever choose to. From time to time it may need to be reinforced by meditations and affirmations, but will remain in the soul, even through future lifetimes. 509"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"The Power of Chant The entire universe vibrates to the tune of a certain frequency. Everything is composed of vibrating molecules that are on tuned into a certain frequency. The world powers are aware of this, and certain departments of the government have experimented with these frequencies. Sounds we cannot normally hear can affect our thoughts moods and emotions, also our psychic and physical selves. Our chakras are very sensitive to vibration, and specific chants relative to each chakra stimulate the chakra beyond visualizing and breathing techniques. With each chakra, the tone of the chant should get higher, beginning with the root chakra where the chanting is in low tone (The crown chakra is soundless). Chanting does much in stimulating and opening the chakras. Vibrating and chanting God names is also very powerful. We can chant the names of Satan and the Demons, visualizing their colors, and focusing on the attributes of the certain Demons, that we wish to obtain for ourselves. Sigil visualization is also very powerful. The Enochian Keys are very powerful when chanted in monotone during ritual. Chanting brings more power to workings. Sound can break glass or turn one's insides into jello, killing them instantly, this is the power of sound. Chanting the name of a hated one in the correct tone while torturing a poppet, adds power to the working. Our minds, when trained, send out strong electrical impulses, vibrating waves of molecules into a thought form that is directed/sent during ritual through intense focus. Adding sound intensifies the thought form. 510"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"About the Third Eye The 3rd Eye is directly related to the 6th chakra and the pineal gland. It is located on the middle of the forehead above the brows and along with the 6th chakra that sets in back of the third eye and the pineal gland, it is the psychic sight of the soul. In the average person, the pineal gland is atrophied and dormant. Because of centuries of humanity being cut off from practicing power meditation where energy is circulated like blood where it is needed, many areas of the human soul have ceased to function. Another sad result of xianity. The third eye contains the last of the three knots. Once this knot is open and energy flows through, the crown chakra is easy to open. The third eye contains the astral sight. Through the third eye, astral images are tranferred to the brain. The third eye is also important in telepathy and influencing others. I have found in willing others, thought energy should strongly be directed to the other person's third eye, even though this cannot be seen. The third eye is receptive to energy directed at it. The third eye, along with the sixth chakra, controls the eyesight, the sinuses and the skin. It is with the third eye that we can see auras, do scrying and see energy. The pineal gland and the sixth chakra are behind the third eye. The third eye is the front of the 6th chakra. The 6th chakra is where the ida and pingala serpents meet. When the kundalini pierces this chakra, it opens the last of the three knots. A flash of light is often experienced whrn this occurs. Opening the 3rd eye is a major step in consciousness. About the Dagr/Dagaz Rune and its connection with the 6th chakra and the 3rd eye: The Dagr/Dagaz Rune corresponds with with the Word trump of the Tarot. The World means completion. When we pierce through the 6th chakra, the 7th is effortless. This is the uniting of the ida and the pingala. Dagaz is also the rune of the moon and the moon represents the 6th chakra and the 3rd eye. Dagr/Dagaz is the rune of completion. \"This rune can be compared to the spiritual philosopher's stone. In sexual alchemy, dagaz is the moment of orgasm in which the goal of the working is made real. It is useful in all workings of of an 'alchemical' type, whether they be practical or soley concerned with consciousness.\" 511"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"About the Heart Chakra Now as we know as Satanists, the New Age movement is not only off base, but lacks a lot of knowledge. We hear this incessant message of \"love\" ad nauseum, of how the heart chakra is the \"love\" chakra- compassion, self sacrifice, giving, etc. This is a delusion, a delusion to prevent us from knowing its true power. The heart chakra is the powerhouse of the soul. The heart chakra has power over anger, courage, fear and dynamic energy. This energy can be explosive. The element of fire rules the heart and increases the adrenalin for a fight or flight response. The heart chakra is the center of our offense and defense, it is where we can atack with aggression and defeat enemies. The heart chakra under will and controlled breathing techniques can warm the body to resist extremes of cold. When directed, the heart chakra can fill us with vigor, vitality, fearlessness and confidence. A powerful heart chakra enables us to enjoy life more fully. It is the connection point between the upper and lower chakras, like the corpus collossum connects both hemispheres of the brain. The upper chakras deal with the astral; astral sight and telepathy, connecting with others psychically and transferring one's will, sending receiving telepathic messages (3rd eye), astral hearing and communication (throat) and astral knowledge and understanding of the universe (the crown). The lower chakras deal with earthly matters- survival (base), sexuality, creativity (2nd) and the will, rebellion (3rd). The heart chakra is where we have our life's purpose. Because it is so important, it is where the enemy usually attacks. The Gods and Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt are often seen with their arms crossed over their chests. This symbolizes protection of the all important heart chakra. The nazarene who is an enemy to humanity is always seen with his arms open and many paintings with the virgin bitch- same thing- exposing the heart chakra so humans can be psychically victimized. In the English language, we have often heard the adages \"a burning heart\" \"have the heart\" and so forth. The heart chakra has to do with one's zeal for life, one's accomplishments, goals and sense of direction and self-betterment. To have a heart is not the twisted teachings of new age bimbos, but to have the heart to achieve your highest goals, the drive to push yourself to be the best you can be, the enthusiasm and personal motivation that drives us forward, the burning DESIRE. This is where we advance and achieve. Famous athletes who make it to the top Olympic teams are the ones who are completely focused on their sport and training and have the burning desire to the point of obsession to make it to the top. They have the heart. The enemy attacks the heart as this is where the driving life-force, ambition and powerhouse of the soul is located. The effects of a depleted heart chakra are depression, apathy (not caring about anything; indifference), only existing and not really living, being a mindless slave, disconnected from all emotion and feeling. The end result is suicide or death from just not caring anymore. The heart chakra is the seat of all our emotions as well as our ambition and drive. One can hate with a whole heart as well. This is where the driving force in black magick comes from that will make or break a spell-working. If one lacks the feeling or desire, one will not achieve the objectives at hand. This is why the heart chakra is so important. New age teachings are corrupted and incomplete.

There are three main bandhas. • Two are the most powerful: the \"Moola bandha\" and the Jalandhara bandha.\" • The Moola Bandha is also known as the \"Root Lock.\" This is applied by contracting your anus. • The Jalandhara Bandha is also known as the \"Chin Lock.\" This is applied by dropping the chin to the chest. Both the Root and Chin Locks can be done at the same time after inhaling, while holding the breath. One should remain motionless while applying and holding the locks. • The third major lock is the \"Uddiyana Bandha\" also known as \"The Abdominal Lift.\" This is applied when holding an exhale, after exhaling completely. To exhale totally, when all of your air is out of your lungs, try humming and this will get the last of the breath out. To apply the Abdominal Lift; lungs completely empty, suck in your abdomen and lift it up. This bandha should be applied as long as the exhale lasts. 515"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"516"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"517"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Satanic Magick 518"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Beginning Magick Magick and Self-Esteem None of us is perfect. Everyone on this earth has his/her personal flaws. No one is an exception. Any good interrogator or psychiatrist knows to keep searching until a weak aspect of the personality is hit upon to make the subject crack. My point here is too many people are down on themselves. I have studied extensively concerning the mind and such, especially since coming to Satanism. Satanism is a religion of advancing the mind and soul into the godhead. Few people have any idea as to just how open to suggestion the average human mind is. This is especially true in the early years of life when the mind and soul are being formed and imprinted upon. This sets the foundation for the rest of the entire life. That old saying, \"Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life\" is a crock of shit. Everything we do or do not do will create the foundation for success or failure in our future. This is not to say one cannot change, what I am saying here is everything we experience and do in our earlier years establishes a foundation for better or worse. Oftentimes, a child's early years are filled with plenty of putdowns and insults that sink deep into the mind and soul and establish a foundation of self-hatred. This runs deep. I have read some messages in the Teens for Satan e-group where a few kids experienced unwanted thoughts of blasphemy towards Satan during a dedication or ritual. These thoughts are repressed negative emotions resulting from low self-esteem and repressed self-hatred. The mind at some point or points in the life was programmed to create self-sabotage. Why the thoughts? Because those thoughts act to hurt and destroy the one who is having them. As children, we often hear \"You're stupid!\" \"You'll never amount to a fucking thing!\" \"You're worthless, ugly,\" etc. Many are blamed for their parents having to get married. This was much more common of old. This sort of thing goes on and on and on and into adulthood. Another is body image. Few have a perfect body and those who do, ageing will change all of that. in addition, the Jews work overtime in the fashion industry to encourage anorexia nervosa and sterility in bearing children. Unless - for women, one is about 5\"4; weighs around 100 lbs, wears size 6 shoes, finding clothes can be a problem. I have seen enough of this shit. At one time, I had perfect weight, as I worked out roughly 30 hours a week or more. I did this because I loved it. I have had to wear men's clothing and shoes for most of my life, as much of the clothing designed for women does not fit properly. This shit is intentional. The clothing made for women in many stores is totally unreasonable. Yet, I have seen many women put themselves down because they cannot fit the image put forth by the Jewish controlled fashion industry. I could go on with this much further, but this is not a sermon about women's fashion. My entire point here is each and every one of us should be the best we can be. For those with low self- esteem, finding something you are very good at (yes, there IS something, and more than likely more things) and working at it. Everyone has a talent in a certain area. Those who are serious about magickal practice MUST rid themselves of low self-esteem. The mind has been programmed to completely fuck you. THIS MUST BE UNDONE!! Take healing for example, when there are nagging hang-ups, then the issue of whether you DESERVE to be healed will come up. Same thing with black magick as well. Do your enemies DESERVE to be punished?

The good news is each and every one of you with low self-esteem can REPROGRAM your mind and soul with contrary positive affirmations. Don't expect miracles overnight, but this must be consistent and long lasting until all of the negative thought patterns and forms are completely gone. Just saying in your mind \"I love myself\" \"I accept myself\" 'I want and deserve the best for myself in every way that will bring happiness and joy into my life\" - affirm this in your mind whenever negative thoughts or doubts creep in. Affirm it to yourself several times a day. Some people complain their magick isn't working or the results are not what they truly desire on a conscious level.

Satan was prevented from finishing his work on humanity: that of the human soul into the godhead. The \"godhead\" is spiritual and physical perfection and immortality, along with godlike powers, wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. This is the underlying message of all of the legitimate occult disciplines, such as alchemy and the legends of the Gods which are all allegories containing this powerful message. At first mention for those who are inexperienced with witchcraft (using the powers of one's own mind and soul to obtain one's desires), images of old hags with pointed black hats, broomsticks, bats, cauldrons, frogs, toads, amulets, sacred stones, symbols, etc., pour forth in one's mind. The powers one uses are the powers of his/her own mind and soul, to begin with. The above mentioned, many are just useless props, such as a cauldron. Others, such as amulets, rings of stones and so forth amplify energy. Covens (groups of witches/warlocks) can be extremely powerful in amplifying energy, as many gifted people work together to apply these powers, many in the case of where one working alone could not accomplish certain workings. Raising energy and direction of that energy in obtaining desires, whatever they may be, is what witchcraft is all about. We often see circles along with astrological glyphs and other occult symbols in the movies and such. Astrological timing of raising and directing energy is often critical to the success of a working and greatly amplifies the powers. Witches and warlocks [mages](those who use the powers of their minds and souls and have this knowlege) use whatever means they can to amplify their powers. This is important. Demons and spiritual assistants often use frogs, toads and other animals called \"familiars\" to assist mages in their work, and communicate through the medium of an animal, which is always very well cared for and close to the mage; a powerful bond is formed. The familiar also offers protection and is a gift from Satan. Summary: 1. True Satanism is working to advance one's mind and soul and personal powers. 2. \"Witchcraft\" is using these powers, which are of the mind/soul. Symbols, amulets, stones and other props act to amplify the energy, either directly, or indirectly for those who prefer to use imagery to intensify their powers. 521"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"Magick 1001: The Three Steps of Witchcraft This article is basically for new people or a getting back to basics. While there is no \"three-fold law,\" there are three basic STEPS to working magick. 1. You raise the energy 2. You program the energy 3. You direct the energy. When you begin directing the energy, you should continue to program it, while you visualize it doing what you want it to do. Let's begin with step one. First, you have to have energy to work with, the stronger, the better. The stronger your own energy, the more energy you will naturally be able to raise, direct, and handle. The more experienced you are, the easier this becomes. All of this is like working a muscle. The more you work with it, the stronger it becomes. For white magick (this is best to work with for newbies, black magick requires more experience and skill) you will more than likely want to use your own energy and connect with the working. Using Runes and vibration is one of the quickest and most powerful ways of raising energy. Other ways are using the foundation meditation or through just visualization. You raise the energy and should feel it strongly, throughout your entire body. With Step Two, you must program the energy. By \"program,\" I mean you must tell it what you want it to do. Energy all by itself is pretty much neutral and inert. With step two, you must use what are called \"affirmations.\" \"Affirmations\" are short, to the point phrases in the present tense that are repeated to program the energy. The present tense must be used because energy does not have the reasoning power to understand \"will happen.\" \"Will\" can be at any time. For example: You don't want to say \"_____ will come to me.\" Instead, you want to say \"________IS coming to me.\" Energy does not have the reasoning power as to *HOW* what you want is coming to you. Energy takes the path of least resistance, unless it is programmed. For example, many of you want more money. Don't just affirm \"Money is coming to me.\" This could manifest, if undirected, say on a job where you handle money, like a cashier for example, or through your paycheck, as usual. That is the easiest way. You have to further affirm: \"Large amounts of free and easy money are coming to me.\" \"This money is all mine to keep and spend as I wish.\" You also should affirm \"in a very positive and happy way for me.\" You don't want a loved one to die and leave you an inheritance or get the money in a way that would be unpleasant. So your affirmation would go something like this: \"Large amounts of free and easy money are coming to me, This money is all mine to keep and spend as I wish. This money is coming to me in a very positive and happy way for me.\" Affirmations should be repeated with intent, five to ten times or more, in your mind. You can also visualize energy as with step three, throughout the day and state your affirmations a few times to reinforce the working. ALWAYS REMEMBER: ENERGY TAKES THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE AND DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REASON. Another example is weight loss. You don't want to wind up getting seriously ill, as this is one of the 522"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"easiest ways to drastically lose weight. Your mind can do it for you when properly programmed, for example affirm: \"I am losing weight in a very positive and healthy way for me.\" With step three, you direct the energy. You do this through visualization. Energy using white magick should be visualized as a white-gold light, shining brilliant like the Sun. You need to visualize this brilliant energy either around your entire self and/or around whatever it is that you want. Visualize in your mind whatever it is OCCURRING NOW and visualize the energy lighting it up. For example, with attracting money, you would want to visualize the money (your wallet full, or whatever), even *feel* and *smell* the money, touch it; the more realistic and the more astral senses you use, the more effective this will be, and infuse it with as much energy as you can, the more brilliant, the better, using your visualization. Feel happy emotions. For health, direct the energy to the afflicted organ, and visualize yourself as healthy and happy. Again, FEEL happy, while you are doing the working, as if it is already so. Now, forget about the working and try to think of other things. This can be difficult in desperate situations, but do the best you can, because worry and obsessing over a working can undo the energy you put into it. Just let it go and know it is working. The only exception to this is, I already went over in the above: You can also visualize energy as with step three, throughout the day and state your affirmations a few times to reinforce the working. Just don't obsess over it, as this is a lack of faith in your own power and can dilute the energy or ruin the working. This sort of thing takes practice like anything else. Now, for black magick, you do not want to come into contact with any negative energy you raise. Those who do not have knowledge do this sort of thing and suffer many times for it. The answer to everything is knowledge. Now, I am speaking from my own experience here. Most popular grimoires and such will tell you to use black energy. In my own experience, I have found grey energy to be the most devastating. Grey energy is also death energy. It causes illnesses and all sorts of negative things. For example, a death spell. I speak from experience here. Take the death energy from a cemetery or anywhere there is death and pull it out of the ground, using visualization. Program it, as in step two, for example, \"The grey death energy is killing_______.\" Do this while you are putting it on the individual you wish to do away with. I have also found through direct experience, this must be done many times on a regular basis. I also want to add, most popular writings will instruct you to raise as much emotion, such as anger and hatred as possible. Again, this is ok, but not necessary. What is necessary are the strength of your own soul, your will and directing the energy. On a lesser note, those who deliberately try to do you harm in your life, simply direct their own energy right back to them, using the grey tones. Sit back and watch them suffer and revel in it. 523"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Creating an Astral Temple Making regular use of an astral temple can increase the effectiveness of your magick and has many other uses. Astral projection is ideal, but not necessary. A deep meditative state and visualization are the keys. You should construct your temple during ritual, where you can ask Father Satan to bless it. Meditate for as long as you need to construct your own place. This should be done after the invocation where you write a request for Satan to bless and consecrate your temple. You can construct your temple any way you wish. This is your area. Visualize the outside of your temple first. This can be a pyramid or any shape you choose, and made of any materials you choose (they should be strong). Walk through the door. This is your area. Create your own altar, carpet or floor, any size, shape or color. You can add anything to your temple that you wish. Burning lamps of fire, huge Baphomets, velvet walls of red, blue, or black, seats with cushions lining the walls for meeting with Demons, huge golden or silver incense burners- these are just a few ideas. This is your very own private inner place where you are free. The more you visit this place, the stronger it will become. When finished with the ritual, you should at some time perform sex magick where you go to your astral temple and use orgasm to direct a powerful energy of light (this should be electric blue) to fill the entire place. This can be done more than once. When finished, you can invite your Guardian Demon and any other Demons you have relationships with to see it. Uses for your astral temple: • Ritual • Meditation (all kinds and astral work) • Telepathic communication with other human beings • Meeting with Demons You can meet with Demons here. You should first know the Demon you wish to meet with and have a relationship with him/her. Here is a place where you can communicate and ask questions. You can also go there and focus on certain issues requiring psychic ability or communicate telepathically. To communicate telepathically with another human being, go to your temple at a time when he/she is sleeping and ’will’ his/her soul to your temple. Do this by visualization. When he/she is present, if you wish to influence him/her, separate his/her soul drawing out the light body and speak to the light body, giving short commands in the present tense. If you wish to discuss something of importance, speak as you would as if he/she is actually sitting across from you. You can also tell him/her that he/she will not remember the actual meeting taking place when he/she awakens, but will obey all commands. 524"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Binding Spell What you need: • Material to make a poppit • A small personal belonging of the individual you wish to bind (that can be sewn inside of the poppit) • A long enough piece of dark blue material or ribbon to bind the poppit like a mummy. • A nail and a tree to hang the poppit from • You can use herbs to fill the poppit if the article is not large enough or does not fit the form of the poppit. Adding cloves will act to “still the tongue.” Remember- herbs have no real power of their own, other than medicinal properties. To maximize the power of the herb(s), they must be infused with the elements. *See Important Info About Herbs Other herbs to add include one or more of the following: • Agrimony • Asafoetida • Birch • Bloodroot • Broom • Comfrey • Cypress • Dragon’s Wort • Hyssop • St John’s Wort • Rue • Tobacco • Vervain • Mullein All of the above herbs are ruled by the planet Saturn. Saturn is the planet of binding. When you are finished stuffing and sewing the poppit, mark it to represent the person you wish to bind. Draw the individual’s face as best you can- facial hair, if any, glasses- this does not have to be perfect. Now sew up the mouth with intent. Place your poppit on your altar and begin a standard ritual. After invoking the Crowned Princes of Hell, touch your athame to the poppit’s mouth and say: “I present(name)__ to be bound. What I do to this image, I do to ___(name)____. Now pick the poppit up and begin winding the material/ribbon around the poppit beginning at the mouth, like a mummy, leaving one leg unbound (so you can hang it). When finished, place it again on your altar and recite the following: __(Name)__ is bound, he/she is unable to 525"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"speak against me. __(Name)__ is bound, he/she is unable to act against me. __(Name)__ is bound, he/she is unable to harm me in any way.

Nail the poppit where it will not be disturbed or easily seen. Give thanks to the Powers of Hell and leave the poppit. *This step of the ritual (how to hang the poppit), was given to me from Azazel. 526"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Spell for Love/Sex To incite love or lust, sexual orgasm is used and directed into the soul of the desired one. This ideally should be done often and when he or she is asleep. Stimulate yourself to climax by fantasizing over the desired one. At the moment of climax, visualize the energy lighting up his or her entire body and aura and command it with an affirmation. The affirmation should be short, in the present tense and to the point. For example: \"__(name of desired one)__ is deeply in love with me and sexually desires me.\" To further empower the spell, go into a trance and when he or she is preferable sleeping, visualize his or her and pull out his/her light body and gently but firmly command it. For example: _(name of desired one)__, you love me and desire me greatly, every day. I am irresistible to you.\" The more often you do this, the better. This may also have to be reinforced every so often. 527"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"How to Use the Aura in Magick Everything has an aura, whether it is living or inanimate. The aura is an energy field created by the vibrating atoms and molecules that comprise all matter. The universe itself vibrates to a certain frequency and the gravity that holds everything together is electromagnetic in nature. Everyone’s aura is as unique as his or her own fingerprints. No two auras are alike. The aura can be used to protect, attract, influence, maim, or even kill. This field of bioelectricity surrounding living things can be programmed using the power of one’s mind. Those who are trained and have an active third eye can see auras clearly and discern much personal information just by reading the color, strength, size and shape of one’s aura. To see your own aura, you should start out by going into a light trance state. You should have already opened your third eye. Hold your hand out in front of you, preferably against a dark background. In the beginning, you should be able to see some faint lines surrounding your hand and fingers. The more you tune into this, like anything, (practice is what is needed here), the better you will become. The better you become at seeing your own aura, you soon will be able to see the auras of others, by just tuning in to them. Later on, you will be able to see colors, layers, and shapes. Feeling auras is much easier than seeing them. Power meditation, when done consistently, increases one’s sensitivity to energy. Manipulation of energy is essential in working spells and magick. To feel your aura, run one of your hands over the top of the other, or over your forearm. You should feel the energy. You can also practice feeling the auras of friends and family members if they are interested in letting you do so. This will develop your touch sensitivity. To strengthen and build your aura, you must take in energy. This can be done through power meditation. The Energy Meditation is excellent for charging up your aura. Hatha (physical) Yoga and Tai Chi also help to strengthen and build the aura. Both of these disciplines tend to balance the auric energies as well. Cleaning your aura is very important. A clean healthy aura strengthens the immune system and prevents harmful energies from invading one’s body. Nearly all harmful entities are invisible to the naked eye. Energies, as most physicists know, can be broken down into sub-atomic particles, foe example, light can be broken down into photons. The energy radiated by a powerful aura will burn these harmful energies and entities up before they can do any harm. B. Cleaning your aura (powerful white light) is imperative after any rituals involving the employment of black magick, throwing any curses, no matter how small, on the spur of the moment, or any exercise involving the use of negative or destructive energy. One’s chakras should also be cleaned and empowered. This is done by putting a strong and intense white light on each chakra. This is needed to rid one’s self of any residual negative energies that could otherwise do harm. This also prevents rebounding energies. Always take as much time as you need; never be in a hurry. Prevention is always better than having to deal with problems later on. A powerful aura gives health, happiness, charisma, and energy. People with weak auras are usually in poor health and are depressed. Our personal energies act on our environments and direct our fate. People who have weak auras are usually prone to misfortune. The aura can be programmed with power hypnosis. Read the page on power hypnosis to make maximum use of the following workings. Now, with dealing with the aura and subconscious mind, one 528"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"must always be 100% clear on every aspect of what is desired. With love, we don’t want one who is unavailable. With money, we don’t want it to come to us through tragedy- this sort of thing. When working with the mind as in ceremonial magick, energy takes the quickest and easiest route to bring us the desired result and if every aspect isn’t covered, any undirected energy will seek out whatever is available. Color is especially important when programming the aura. Below are examples of how we can effectively program our auras to do things: For example: You want love in your life: Visualize your aura while you are in a trance, the deeper the better. Breathe in energy and affirm several times in the present tense: “My aura is attracting my perfect [love/sexual partner, soul mate, whatever]. Change the affirmation to suit your own individual needs. Affirm this with meaning, five- ten times while breathing in energy. To attract the love/lust and or attentions of a specific person: Affirm: I am programming my aura to attract and act on_________’s, aura. He/she finds me very attractive and sexually irresistible. You want/need protection: Breathe in powerful white-gold light. With the inhale breathe it in to meet in the middle of your body, packing it in brighter and brighter. With the exhale, keep expanding it. The energy should grow brighter and brighter. Affirm: My aura is very powerful and is protecting me at all times. This a good exercise to be done on a regular basis, for building a strong, protective energy field. You want to make a good impression: A powerful aura will often influence others to grant you favors. Affirm: My aura is making a very positive impression on _______. If this is a job interview, (the person(s) interviewing me tomorrow, whatever). The people hearing my presentation, the group etc. Always state this in the present tense. The subconscious mind does not understand the word “will” and “will” never comes. For keeping unwanted individuals away: Breathe in white light like the Sun. White light reflects and repels. Affirm: ”My aura is repelling, [inspire fear/dread] in_______, and keeping ________far away from me at all times. To heal yourself: A lot of energy is needed for healing. Breathing in energy from the Sun is excellent for empowering one’s aura. The Sun also contains all of the colors of the chakras in their most pure and vibrant states. The Sun (666) is one of the most powerful sources of energy there is. When one is ill, there is an imbalance in the chakras ruling the body part/s that are injured or ill. To heal, you must work with both the color of the ruling chakra and its opposite to create a balance. Breathe in the color of the energy of the chakra ruling the injured or ill body part and affirm: ”I am breathing in __(name of color)__ energy that is balancing my __chakra__ and healing my_______. When you are finished, breathe in white energy to balance your aura. The auras of others can also be worked with and programmed. From reading the above, you should by now be getting the idea and able to improvise your own affirmations. 529"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"To protect loved ones: Put a powerful white-gold light around the person. For more powerful workings, this is best done in a deep trance. Affirm: I am placing a powerful protective aura around ______. This should be done regularly, and can be done while the loved one sleeps. For inciting lust: Put a powerful red or orange aura around the person. Affirm: “_________ is experiencing irresistible sexual obsession, desire/lust for me.” “_________finds me sexually irresistible.” You can masturbate using sex magick and drive the energy into the desired one’s aura. This is best begun on a Sunday or Tuesday during a waxing Moon. Never do this when the Moon is in the celibate sign of Virgo, though. For inciting love: Put a powerful green aura around the person. Feel strong feelings of love as you program it. Affirm: ”_______is falling deeply and uncontrollably in love with me.” ”_________is obsessed with me”, etc. You can also use sex magick here as with the working above. This is best begun on a Friday during a waxing Moon. Healing others: Visualize a powerful white-gold aura surrounding and glowing about the loved one. You should also use color energy (see the above paragraph on healing for one’s self) Affirm: I am putting powerful healing energy into ______'s aura; this energy is effectively fighting the _______ and restoring him/her to perfect health. In cases of serious illness, this may have to be done often every day. Healing others can be extremely draining. If you are inexperienced, remote healing is best. Direct contact as with the hand chakras applying energy directly to the afflicted one can be dangerous. The illness can be absorbed into the healer. To do this type of direct work, one must have a powerful aura and work to clean it thoroughly after each healing session. Using the energy of the Sun is most effective here. BLACK MAGICK AND KILLING. Killing: This is best done while the offending party is asleep. Put a black aura around the person, as this will prepare his or her own aura to absorb the destructive energy. After doing this, you can vent your hatred. Be sure to visualize over and over again with feeling, exactly how you intend this person to die. Affirm: I am placing a powerful aura of destructive around______ that is continuously working to kill him/her. This work is best begun on a Saturday or a Tuesday during a waning Moon. Be sure to clean your aura and chakras following each working. To cause bad luck and/or harm: If your own aura is powerful enough, just sitting and stewing about the person should be enough. I have found it is important to visualize repeatedly in a relaxed, but angry way a specific misfortune. With all workings of black magick the outcome depends on the strength of the auras involved. The aura of the victim *must* be weaker than that of the sorcerer. If the victim’s aura is more powerful, the working could rebound as a more powerful aura naturally deflects negative energy. Some people just have naturally powerful auras. This can come from past lives. If an offending person naturally has a more powerful aura, you will be able to feel resistance. Take the time to build your own aura before doing any kind of this sort of working. 530"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Intermediate Magick Image Magick: Using a Poppet Image magick has been used for centuries. The basic idea is that using some object to represent a victim, what is done to the object is done to the victim. This practice goes all the way back to Ancient Egypt. For best results, use a personal belonging of the victim’s that has their vibes in it to construct the poppit. A photo, a small article of clothing, car keys, small personal possessions, hair, fingernail clippings, sexual fluids, or even dirt taken from a footprint can be used. There are endless possibilities, as long as the article has a close connection in some way with the enemy. Poppets were often constructed from wax or clay in the old days. Wax can be hard to work with. It is best to construct the image to be sturdy and not soft, if you plan to inflict any serious damage. The poppit should be constructed to take abuse. What is important is that the right amount of focusing and hatred goes into the working. Driving a nail into it's head will cause insanity. Driving a nail into the heart, with the right kind of focus and intensity, will cause death if done with enough intensity and the operator’s aura is powerful enough. Burying the image in the ground will cause the person to waste away as the image rots in the ground. Take whatever you have and use it in the construction of the image. Clothing articles may have to be cut to size. What is left over can be saved for the ritual working. A doll can be sewn and stuffed with what you have obtained. Wax, clay or the like can be molded and blended with pieces of the victim’s personal belongings. While constructing this image, chant aloud, or inside your head, the name of the enemy it represents, over and over as long as it takes to complete the image. This should be a mantra of hatred. While chanting, focus intensely on the wrongs this person has committed and your hatred towards them. When it is finished, write or engrave the enemy's name upon it. If you wish to completely destroy the enemy, this is best done during a waning Moon. Moon in Taurus, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces are good times for this kind of magick. You can perform a full ritual, where at the height of the ritual, you present the poppet, read aloud or to yourself the wrongs the enemy has committed against you and the curse you wish to inflict. When you are finished reading, burn the paper the curse was written on in the flame of a black candle. I have a silver burning bowl where I place my requests or whatever after I have lit them. While the paper is burning and for a while afterwards, focus all of your anger and hatred upon the enemy, chanting their name repeatedly. This is the time to drive nails into the image, roast it over the fire, twist it, and mutilate it or whatever. Go over the offenses; get all of the anger out until you are completely exhausted. At this point, the image can either be burned (this is best done outside in some secluded area) and the ashes can be buried. Close the ritual. We have found it most effective to nail the poppit to a tree through the head and the heart. Another technique is to bury it. You must direct the hatred and anger.

Just a strong determined will, directing anger into a specific event, for example a specific type of accident, over and over. This should be very clear in your mind and is best done while the victim sleeps. The victim should have easy access to the type of accident or death you have planned. For example- one who never flies obviously won’t die in a plane crash. You have to know the victim’s habits and have a clear image of him/her in your mind and the misfortune you are willing to befall him/her. It is always important after a ritual to clear your mind of the working and let it do its job. Don't forget to clean your aura and chakras after any working of black magick. 532"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Creating Thoughtforms / Servitors IMPORTANT!! THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR CREATING A THOUGHTFORM FOR WHITE MAGICK. FOR BLACK MAGICK, YOU DO *NOT* WANT TO CONNECT IN ANY WAY WITH THE ENERGY, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS!! PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE BEFORE PROCEEDING. FOR BLACK MAGICK, INSTEAD OF INVOKING THE ENERGY, YOU FORM THE ENERGY OUTSIDE OF YOURSELF AND DRAW IT FROM SOURCES THAT HAVE NO CONNECTION TO YOU. A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IS WHY SPELLS SO-CALLED \"BACK-FIRE.\" To add here, from experience- a thoughtform does not always have to be destroyed. Witches for centuries have often kept a reliable magickal assistant. Some have even spent lifetimes with the same assistant. The magickal assistant must be \"fed\" regularly. By \"fed\" this means giving it energy and programming it. Destroying a faithful and reliable servant is foolish. A thoughtform is a small packet of condensed psychic energy. Like all energy, the thoughtform can be programmed to carry out specific tasks and/or directed to travel to a target area. The success of the thoughtform is dependent upon the mind strength and aura of its creator. A weak thought form will quickly dissipate, accomplishing nothing. Powerful thoughtforms, when neglected can wreak havoc. Energy feeds on energy and a thought form that is several weeks old will have accumulated all kinds of different influences, emotions and other energy from its surroundings. This might appear to be amusing to some, but the mutated thought form has often been known to reappear in the locale of its creator, only to wreak havoc, due to the outside energies it has accumulated. To create a thoughtform: 1. Sit comfortably. 2. Enter into a deep trance. 3. Keep your eyes closed during this one. When you are completely relaxed, and you can no longer feel your body, you are ready to begin. 4. Now, visualize a beam of light entering your body through the crown of your head and filling your aura. The color of the light should correspond with the intended working of the thoughtform. Saturate your entire being with the colored energy until you are vibrating with it. 5. Given the nature of the working, choose a corresponding chakra (according to color) where you will release the energy. Keeping your eyes closed, visualize this energy streaming from the chakra and forming a ball in front of you. For works involving the base chakra, (normally black magick), you should visualize the energy leaving the base chakra and the energy ball packing between your legs. For workings involving the crown, pack the energy straight up above your head. It is important that the energy be released in a straight line. Keep pa cking the energy into the ball so it becomes more and more solidified. 6. When the energy is sufficiently strong, you can begin to shape it into whatever form will serve your purpose. Visualize what it is you want this creature to do and infuse the creature with it. Keep it simple. Complex and detailed instructions don’t work with thought forms. 7. Using a very short phrase, 1-5 words, silently or aloud, keeping your eyes closed, command the creature, then release it like a bullet shot into the void. 533"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"The creature will feed on the emotions of whomever it is sent to. You can even program it to attach itself to another person’s aura. For example: In the case of arousing love/lust, you can masturbate and drive the energy into the creature at the time of programming. You should use the energy from both your base and second chakras to incite lust. For workings of affection, use the heart chakra. For workings of sexual love, use the heart and second chakras. The dominant energy color should be the basis of your working. Say you want a lot of love, but some lust as well, then visualize the energy as green with an orange dust. Certain colors can be combined, but those that create an entirely new color as with green and orange = brown, the energy will not be harmonious with the working. Then all you need for the command is the person's name you wish it to attach to. Ideally, you should command the form to attach at the appropriate chakra for the working; i.e. for lust, the second chakra. Thoughtforms can be attached to material objects as well. The can protect or cause damage. To destroy the thought form: 1. Summon it. Visualize it coming to you and hovering in the air before you. 2. Focus and visualize the energy dissipating like smoke into the air.

Through the optic nerve, the eyes are linked to the brain. When we train our minds and elevate our bioelectricity, we can directly mesmerize other people by just looking into their eyes and catching their gaze for several seconds. How this is done: 1. You must have a strong willful mind, able of controlling others who are weaker. 2. The closer you are to the person, the more effective this technique. This takes practice. 3. You have to be in a trance yourself. An adept can will him/herself into and out of a trance, anytime, anywhere. 4. You have to concentrate and project your bioelectricity along with your intentions out of your own eyes into the other person's. a. Sit in front of a mirror and relax. Look up for about 1-2 minutes, this helps to get you into the alpha state. Deepen your trance as deep as you can go. b. Focus into your own eyes in the mirror. Start projecting your energy through your eyes. *When training, do not focus any negative energy upon yourself for obvious reasons! c. You should start to feel your own energy, as it is reflected back through the mirror. Do this every day and your energy will become stronger. d. When you feel much power and you are confident enough, you can try this out on other people. Animals are also very susceptible. You will be able to stop an attack dog in its tracks. 5. When mesmerizing someone, command this person, in your mind what it is you intend for him/her to do, experience, etc. The same goes for curses that should be delivered with maximum hatred and intensity. The commands should be a short phrase. Animals communicate through mental images. 6. Look deep into his/her eyes, almost past them into the back of their skull, directly projecting your energy into their brain to do your will. Focus intensely. This is a very advanced skill. You can also practice with a close or trusted friend, as long as you keep the energy positive. Negative energy will cause harm, so don't play around with this. This skill takes often years of consistent practice to become adept to where your stare, in just a few seconds will put others under your control. 535"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Sex Magick Sexual Orgasm is equivalent in power to the Life Force. Using sexual orgasm in ritual and in your magickal workings can give much added power to your outcome. Sex Magick is ancient, extremely powerful and is the creative principle. At the moment of orgasm, one automatically enters a brief trance state. The powerful orgasmic energy can be directed. This is visualized as a brilliant bright light like the sun and can be directed into thoughtforms, the one of one's desires, talismans and so forth. Women and men both differ in sexual energy. Women tend to peak in power according to cycles. Women are at the height of their power during menstruation. Psychic work, astral projection and other pursuits that require heightened sensitivity are greatly assisted after a strong orgasm. Orgasm is also an excellent way to induce relaxation before meditation. Sexual fluids, both semen and vaginal secretions, and also menstrual blood have the power of the life force. • At the moment of orgasm, it is important to direct your entire concentration and desire to your goal, willing it. Visualize the orgasmic energy in the form of a beam, ball or vortex, penetrating the object/person, lighting it up with a brilliant aura of energy that is programmed. This is basic simple sex magick. Sex magick can be done alone, or with a partner or Demon/ess or in a group. When working with others, it is very important as in all magickal practices that everyone work together with some sort of organized effort. Merging orgasmic energies with a Demon/ess is extremely powerful. This article was written a long time ago. I will be adding much more information concerning advanced solo and partner sex magick, timing the magick according to the moon phases, the stars and so forth. Below is a PDF beginner's book on sex magick that is informative. 536"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Using Thoughtforms There are times when we want to influence many people at the same time. This can be done with a thoughtform programmed and placed in a certain room or area. We all know how places become haunted or have certain vibes in them. This usually happens because of an event the provoked intense emotions and left traces of these emotions behind by living people. When we are powerful enough, through intense concentration and focus, we can project energy into our hands and mold it into a ball (we should be able to feel this if it is strong enough for a working) or project energy into a ball using our chakras. The energy ball can be placed in an area where it will remain undisturbed, to be worked on later, by projecting more energy into it to make it more powerful. When we project the energy, it should be of the color of the influence we wish to manifest; for example, yellow for friendship, pink for romantic love, red for hatred and discord, accidents, green for the attraction of money and so forth. While projecting the energy and color, we need to program the thoughtform with focus and intensity. When the thoughtform is finished, we command it to go to the area where we want it to influence. We can put more than one in large areas, such as an auditorium, workplace, school, etc. After a while, they will need to be replaced, as they will dissipate as they influence people. One well made though form can influence as many as 100 or more people at a time. 537"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"Secreting Ectoplasm About Ectoplasm: Ectoplasm has many different astral uses. Extra-terrestrials use this in a much more potent form than humans. This is the cloud that forms before many abductions, where there is a loss of time and memory. Ectoplasm can make one invisible and can be used to kill with death rituals. After proficiency is achieved in producing this substance, one can will it to manifest in specific colors that are harmonious with the objective of the working. The most common example of the use of ectoplasm is with mediums. The ectoplasm gives the evoked spirit something to manifest itself in. Ectoplasm can also add much more potency to creating a thoughtform. How to secrete ectoplasm: Ectoplasm is the substance we see with the clouds when scrying. This is a minor form of ectoplasm, but will get you started. Candle light is perfect for this exercise. Candle color here does not matter, so use whatever you have available. If you have a black mirror, you will want to use this, but any other similar props will do. You can even use a regular mirror or a bowl of dark or black liquid. 1. Sit in a quiet dimly lit room. 2. Relax and go into a trance state. This does not have to be a deep trance, just enough so you are focused. 3. Look into the mirror or bowl of liquid and stare at one point. You should eventually see clouds form. 4. Concentrate on these clouds, willing them in a soft way to condense and thicken. 5. When you are consistently able to will the clouds to condense and thicken, gently and slowly take your eyes off the mirror. You should still be able to see the clouds in front of you. Try to focus on them for two to three minutes. The goal is to secrete this substance and to manipulate it at will. 6. Blink your eyes and move your fingers and toes and gently bring yourself back from the trance. When you become proficient at secreting ectoplasm, will the ectoplasm into a ball shape. From there, work at making it thicker and form it into different shapes. This will take practice so be patient. After a time, you can will it into different colors for specific purposes. 538"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Satanic Healing *Be sure to click on the link regarding healing loved ones at the bottom of the page. Several years ago, Father Satan spoke with me concerning healing. I had a problem and he told me at that time \"You are not strong enough.\" I had a heavy radio setting beside me and he stated an example \"Try moving that radio using a sheet of paper.\" Obviously the paper would have crumpled. To effectively heal, your soul must have power. This is accomplished through consistent power meditation. Once your soul is powerful enough, healing comes much easier. Before I go on, I want to state that anyone who is under a doctor's care or taking medication SHOULD NOT stop taking ANY medication prescribed or forego medical treatment, antibiotics, etc., until given a medical clearance by a licensed physician. We are not xians! Antibiotics and such SAVE LIVES! I, myself am very grateful for modern medical technology. The ability to heal using your own powers is very advanced and takes experience. If you do not like the advice of one doctor, then get a second opinion from another doctor, but do not just go about psychic healing and deny yourself or others in your care, such as children or animals, proper and prompt professional medical treatment. Never stop taking any medication, or alter prescribed doses unless given the ok by your doctor. To heal yourself, you should already have experience in working magick. 1. Make sure your chakras are properly aligned. This ensures that needed energy is getting to them. Disease usually manifests in the soul/astral body before symptoms occur in the physical body. This is almost always due to poor energy/chi circulation to the organ/s or a cut-off of a pathway due to an accident, or injury. 2. You should begin by cleaning the diseased part as you would clean your aura. Cleaning the diseased part should be done several times every day immediately before applying the healing energy. 3. The foundation of healing for most problems is to raise and direct energy and keep sending it to the afflicted organ, while programming it. When you FEEL your energy strongly, just direct it to the diseased/afflicted part of your body. Throughout the day, you can also keep directing your energy and visualize the white-gold light, lighting up the organ and state your affirmation. This can be done lightly, in addition to the more formal working in step 2. 4. Step two needs to be repeated several times every day, until healing is complete. 5. Healing can also be done using Runes. Vibration is exceptionally powerful in both raising and empowering energy. 6. You have to KNOW it is working and not have any doubts. In other words, have faith in your ability. 7. Always remember to keep your affirmations in the present tense. \"The__(disease)__ is leaving my body (or diseased organ), completely and permanently. My________ is strong, healthy and normal in every way.\" 8. Be open. Many times the working will lead us to certain foods or what we need in order to heal health problems. This can come in different ways. To heal a loved one, direct white-gold brilliant light like the Sun into him/her and program it. 539"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"The foundation and objective of Spiritual Satanism is knowledge and applying that knowledge by using our own powers. I had a situation some time ago, with a pet who had a life threatening disorder that occurred all of a sudden. At the time, I had no money for a vet. Father Satan came to me. He stood behind me and placed both of his hands on my shoulders and told me to \"breathe\" energy into her. I visualized the energy as the white-gold light and lit her up with it, as brilliant as the Sun and stated an affirmation \"______ is healthy, safe, and protected in every way.\" I did this twenty times. Father Satan told me, NO, do it 200 times. He also told me she would need to have surgery and he would get me the money. I started to cry. He told me not to cry, as this was a lack of faith. The energy I put into her stabilized her. I had to do it again and shortly thereafter, I had the money for the surgery, which was very expensive. She got the surgery and she is now fine. HEALING LOVED ONES When we perform Satanic healing on our loved ones, it is quite different than working on ourselves. It is best to use healing energy from the earth and let it run through us into the loved one. To do this, it is very important to have open, active and powerful chakras especially in your hands and feet. For more information, click on the links below: Hands Feet Your soul must be strong enough. This comes with repeated and consistent power meditations. Depending upon the severity of the illness or problem, more than one healing session is often necessary. This also depends upon the strength of your own powers. Several months ago, I healed one of my pets by placing my hands over where she was having the problem. I opened both my hand and feet chakras and began drawing in energy through my feet (I was in my house) and directed the healing energy out my palm chakras, all the time visualizing the white- gold brilliant light on her, and affirming she was healed. My powers were also at their height as I did this following a hatha yoga session and power meditation. In this instance, it only took one session and she was fine. There are some guidelines for healing loved ones: 1. Make sure you are strong enough and it is best not to use your own energies. Pulling energy from the earth (this can be from the floor), the sun or any other natural source is best. Always run the energy through yourself. 2. Make sure to completely clean your aura and chakras afterwards. 3. In cases of serious accidents or related, the more people involved in the healing, the better the chance for recovery. Friends, relatives and so forth, if they are at all open-minded can be organized into drawing in energy and applying it to the afflicted one in an emergency situation. Even people who are not trained and who know nothing are better than not doing a thing. The more people, the more energy. 4. Like working any and all magick, one must have confidence in and believe in a full recovery. 5. Affirmations are always necessary as energy does what it is told to do. Affirmations should always be in the present tense and of a positive statement. 6. Once healing sessions are begun, depending upon the severity, they should be repeated until the loved one has made a full and complete recovery. 540"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"7. Cleaning the area or body using a brilliant white light before applying healing energy also helps. 8. As with healing the self- severe cases may require several healing sessions per day. This also depends upon your own personal powers. The more powerful you are, the more powerful and effective your healing energy. Extremely powerful brothers and sisters may only do one healing session with a complete recovery. 9. The longer (more chronic) the ailment, the more difficult it is to heal. Congenital problems (afflictions one is born with) are the most difficult. Nothing is impossible! The human mind is even capable of growing a new limb. The key is extreme personal power through consistent meditation, patience, perseverence and above all -CONSISTENCY! HEALING USING THE SOLAR PLEXUS CHAKRA The chakra of healing is the solar (3rd) chakra. To heal using this chakra (which is very effective): 1. Lie on your back 2. Your hand chakras and finger chakras should be fully opened for this techique. Place your fingertips lightly upon on your solar plexus chakra. Very slowly breathe in and visualize intense brilliant white-gold light entering into your nostrils moving down into your solar chakra and then through your fingertips and into your forearms. 3. Hold your breath and transfer your fingertips to where you are ill and very slowly exhale the energy from your forearms, hands and fingertips into the afflicted area. For example, for curing a soar throat, move your fingertips, (all the while visualizing the brilliant light), to your throat and then very slowly exhale the energy into your throat, visualizing and feeling it leaving your forearms, hands and fingertips and entering into your throat, glowing like a brilliant sun. 4. When the exhale is completed, suspend your breathing for a few seconds while you place your fingertips upon your solar chakra again. Repeat the above. The above is best performed for 10-20 repititions. If major healing is called for, take a break and then perform another 10-20 repititions. I have used the above techique with much success. It is very important to try to catch colds, flu, viruses, etc., in the early stages. By doing so, less energy is required and one can use one's own energy. If one is ill to where using one's own energy is out of the question, this exercise can also be performed using the energy from the sun, which is very powerful. Just breathe in the energy from the sun into your nostrils and follow the above instructions. It is pretty evident that now and in the very near future, we will be faced with deadly strains of viruses and plagues. Many are resistant to antibiotics and other medications. In many places, life saving medications are becoming unaffordable and very hard to obtain, as is medical care. Some medications are even laced with placeboes (blanks). All dedicated Satanists should be practicing power meditation and learning Satanic Healing Techniques. I have had much success with the above and other healing techniques I have written about on this website. The power to heal is a wonderful gift from Satan. Any dedicated Satanist who practices meditation regularly can do this. Things are getting very bad in the world and will get much worse. Those of us who are adept and and apply Satanic knowledge will survive these times intact. 541"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"Energy Ripping Black magick is all about the manipulation and direction of energy. The strength of one's mind and aura determine the type and amount of energy that one can direct and handle safely while producing the desired results. Workings fail because of weakness of one's mind and aura. Energy ripping involves drawing off the life force. One should already have a strong aura that can pull energy at will and be able to transform it for one's personal benefit. There are two ways of going about this. One is the destruction of victim's aura and the second is hooking up an energy line and draining the victim dry. This prepares the victim to be much more vulnerable to psychic attacks and completely opens him/her for the willed input of destructive energy from the mage. 1. One should have a photograph or image of the victim. This is so one can visualize him/her clearly. This is very important to the operation. 2. Go into a trance state. 3. Begin by visualizing yourself drawing off the victim's aura and disintegrating it. You can visualize yourself actually eating and ingesting the aura until it is completely gone or drawing it into your sexual chakra. Always draw energy with your feminine chakras as these absorb. The masculine chakras project energy. It is best to absorb this type of energy in the lower chakras. 4. When the aura is disintegrated and ingested, visualize drawing off all of the inner energies. The victim should change from white energy to grey energy and then to black, indicating the life force has been completely drained. Clean your aura and chakras thoroughly after each working to transform the absorbed energy into personal benefit. The above four steps should be done frequently, a minimum of 3-4 times a week to more than once a day. It will eventually take its toll. After the working has done its job and depleted the victim, one should follow up with black magick workings. Before each black magick operation, the victim's aura should be prepped with black energy so he/she will absorb the destructive energy. Just visualize him/her with a black aura and proceed with the working. Don't forget to thoroughly clean your own aura and chakras. The above is elementary black magick. It can be accomplished by most people with a basic background in energy manipulation and power meditation. More advanced techniques involve working with elemental energy and death energy. When working with death energy, one must be very adept and experienced as this can be dangerous. The life force is replaced with the destructive energy of the elements or the death energy. 542"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"Drawing Down Energy from Stars and Luminaries Energy from stars can be used to enhance personal traits, for example to strengthen self-discipline or for specific energies to be used use in ritual. Absorbing energy from Venus before performing a love spell can greatly assist in the desired outcoe of the working. It is very important to know the nature of the star(s) you intend to invoke energy from, as some stars such as Polaris and Caput Algol are extremely destructive and people have gone insane after invoking their energies. In order to effectively absorb stellar energies, one should be experienced with breathing in energy. The Energy meditation trains us on how to do this. This exercise should be performed outdoors where you can see the star clearly. Steps: 1. Relax and go into trance. 2. Close your eyes and say the name of the star several times while visualizing it. (Photos of stars can be seen by typing the name of the star or constellation into the Yahoo search engine and clicking on “images.”) 3. Keep repeating the name of the star either silently or aloud several times and try to feel the star. You should begin to feel the energy. 4. Now charge your aura with energy until your entire being is glowing. This is done through visualization. Breathe in the energy from the earth into your feet and fill your entire being with it. Now, stand beneath the star and visualize a line of energy about a foot wide extending from your aura and connect it with the star. Begin to breathe in the energy from the star. The energy of each star has a specific color according to its attributes. Visualize the stellar energy saturating and expanding your aura with this color upon each inhale. You can program the energy with affirmations while you are breathing it in. For example, you can affirm: \"I am breathing in green energy from Venus that is bringing me plenty of free and easy money in a happy way that is all mine to keep and spend as I please.\" Visualize your entire being saturated with green and with each inhale, the green becomes more and more vibrant and powerful. A guideline for the colors of stars is: • Red- Martian energy, anger, violence, pure lust. • Blue- peaceful, calming, spiritual, • Yellow- intellect; mind • White- cleansing, strength • Orange- creativity Tips: • You can use a crystal to absorb and store energies from stars to be used at a later time in a ritual or whenever you need them. Hold the crystal under the star in your palm and breathe in energy from the star through your hand chakras, only bring it into the crystal.

Visualize the energy entering your hand and extending to your entire being and aura. The crystal can also be placed over any chakras you choose for the desired effects. Just breathe in the energy. • A variation of the above is to program the crystal to absorb the stellar energy and leave it out under the star for as long as the star is visible and shining on it. Just focus your will into the crystal and tell it you want it to absorb energy from whatever star you choose. Repeat the name of the star several times and project the image of the star into your crystal using your third eye. • You can also absorb energy from entire constellations. This should be done a little at a time until you are familiar with the energies and the effects. • An advanced practice is to absorb the energies of a star you are familiar with into your chakras. Don’t do this unless you are already comfortable with the star’s effects and energies. Just breathe in the energy. You should be familiar and experienced with Chakra Breathing. It is best to work with stellar energies that are in harmony with the chakra you are working on. They should be of the same color. • You can make star charged water. Use a clean magnet, place it at the bottom of a container of water and program it like a crystal. The water will absorb the energy. By drinking the water, you will absorb the energy.

The form is to be created with intensive imagination. You can shape this out of the ball. • Give the thoughtform a name. This name should be unique and unusual because just saying the name either aloud or in tyour mind will immediately summon the thoughtform. Obviously you don't want other people calling out a common name and then here it comes! • You have to impress upon the thoughtform whatever task you wish it to carry out. This must be done with authority and a strong will, with desire. • In working with advanced thoughtforms, you must be specific as to how long the thoughtform has to complete the task. Is it ongoing? or limited to a certain finite time. The procedure is as follows: 1. Go into a medium trance and imagine yourself in an universal ocean of light. White is all purpose, but colors can be used. 2. Use this light to shape an enormous ball of light, compressing and accumulating it more and more until the ball has the size of approximately 12-20 inches. The ball should be like a brilliant radiating sun. 3. Now fill the thoughtform with whatever you desire it to do. Desire strongly and feel this deeply while making your affirmations. The affirmations should be a repeated phrase, right to the point and precise. 4. Name your thoughtform and say this name several times. 5. \"Having fixed the time, the magician orders the elemental to dissolve in and return to the ocean of light as soon as it has fulfilled its task. Expressing it magically, the birth and death of the elemental are fixed in exactly the same manner as Man's or any other being's fate is.\" 6. Breathe in and then blow out with force, sending the ball on its way. 7. Forget about the thoughtform and working. Let it do its job. An elemental knows neither time nor space. Using external energy is important in workings of black magick and workings where you must be completely detached from the thoughtform as opposed to running the energy through yourself with simple thoughtforms. \"It can work independently in the mental sphere and will not be restricted in any way by the magicians' mind. Now and again it is advisable to reload the elemental to give it a greater power of expansion. This is achieved by calling the elemental by the name given to it, and rendering it more dynamic through a new accumulation of light, and sending it of again. As soon as the elemental has fulfilled the required task, it will dissolve itself in the ocean of light. This example should suffice to give the magician a rule of conduct how to create elementals.\" The above is important. You must will the thoughtform to dissolve. Later on, with much more advanced thoughtforms, it will become a powerful entity of its own and harass you if you aren't careful. \"In contrast to thoughts living in their forms in the mental or spiritual sphere, the \"elementals\" are entities with a certain degree of intelligence deliberately created by a magician.

I will quote only a few examples just because of the great variety. With the help of the elementals the magician can influence the mind of any other person optionally, he can strengthen or weaken man's mental and intellectual faculties, he can protect himself or others against foreign influences, transmute friendships into animosities or the other way around, he can produce a favorable atmosphere in associating with his fellow men, and he can bring under his control anybody's will that is not yet developed or profiled.

They have a certain degree of intelligence determined by their creator. They can be helpful in carrying out certain tasks on the astral as well as in the physical world. They can be servitors. Fire elementals appear as a fiery ball before they are formed. Water elementals appear as a glass ball before they are formed. Air elementals will have a bluish color Earth elementals appear clay colored. These beings are capable of many tasks, below are a few examples: 1. Influencing the minds and thoughts of others. 2. Breaking up relationships or strengthening them. 3. Forming friendships or love/lust relationships. 4. Bending weaker individuals to the will of the mage and controlling them through the elemental. 5. Bringing in customers for those in business. Instructions for creating the elemental: 1. The elemental should be of the element relating to and of a form corresponding to the desire you wish to have fulfilled. 2. Give the elemental a name. 3. You must impress your will upon the elemental with authority in giving it orders as what you want it to accomplish. This should be a short present tense phrase. \"Will\" never happens. For example- \"You are...\" 4. You should also impress upon the elemental, that it will be successful in carrying out its order. ** TO BEGIN: 1. Go into a trance. 2. Imagine yourself within the element you wish to use for your work, as you would do for invocation, but do not invoke the element. Instead, focus and condense the element into a sphere in front of you. The element needs to be condensed and powerful. 3. Now, shape the elemental into the desired form and impress your desire both in feeling and a short phrase of command into it. 4. Name your elemental. 5. If you wish to set a time limit, order your elemental to return to the element it was created from at a specific time, after it has completed its task. Failure to do this in some cases, can result in a creature that has a life and will of its own and can be a bother. 6. The elemental can also be programmed to attack itself to and feed from the aura of the person you send it to. 7. To summon the elemental, call it by name and will it back.

You should be adept at controlling and holding the fire element. Out of control, this entity can set anything on fire at random and is not to be toyed with. Be sure to read the page on Advanced Thoughtforms before attempting this. You should also be adept at creating and controlling basic advanced thoughtforms before working with fire. 1. Get into a trance and visualize you are in the middle of fire. Feel the heat and hear the hissing and crackling of the flames and feel the burning. 2. Now, begin to collect and condense that fire into a sphere in front of you. Draw the fire element from all directions into the sphere in front of you. The more of the fire element you direct into the sphere, the more dense, material, and hotter it will become. You should feel the heat while you are doing this. The more you compress and condense the fire, the more the heat will grow. You should actually have the sensation of literally being in an oven. You can also shape the fire ball into any form you wish. The form should correspond with the job. 3. Now fill the fire ball with whatever you desire it to do. Desire strongly and feel this deeply while making your affirmations. The affirmations should be a repeated phrase, right to the point and precise. 4.

The uses for the fire thoughtform are obviously to set something a blaze. I have found when using fire magick, one glows with a warm aura or feels heat when the directed energy or entity is doing its job. The fire ball can be directed into the body of an enemy when working black magick. These methods were used by 1920's, and 1930's Satanic Lodges in Germany and used to eliminate enemies in the form of a psychic sacrifice.

His reply was \"ME.\" I recently found though Bardon claimed the work was his and the teachings of the \"divine providence\" (the enemy), in truth, he was a pupil of Wilhelm Quintscher who was a member of a 99 lodge (Satanic) and invented the tepaphone. Bardon passed the teachings off as his own. \"Frabato\" was a partial biography pieced together by his secretary, but is an important read to understanding the rest of the texts. Information therein was twisted and it was the Satanic Lodge where the teachings in \"Initiation Into Hermetics\" originated. Bardon took the teachings and made them into RHP. I see errors in Bardon's two other books and the beings in the Evocation book are of the enemy from what I can see and are enemy thoughtforms. The exercises and instructions in \"Initiation Into Hermetics\" are actually Satanic and from Demons. I believe this was why Satan led me to this information. Here is some more information: \"And then, of course, one must not forget Franz Bardon! He is not unknown in the English speaking world but my impression is that though many people have heard of him, only few have taken the trouble to actually read his books which have been available in English for over a decade now.\" \"Nevertheless, Bardon, a one time German illusionist of Czech extraction, is still Germany's probably most commonly read magician. His dogmatic, simplicistic approach which describes magic (in no certain terms, at that) as a technology of \"astral electro-magnetism\" involving the manipulation of the polar powers of electricity and magnetism, is really not quite as modern as the layman tends to believe. In fact, it was Bardon's teacher, Ra-Ohmir Quintscher, who back in the twenties invented not only battery magic and his notorious Tepa (sometimes erroneously termed Tepaphone), an electrical device for long range magical manipulation involving the target persons' photographs, but produced practically everything else as well on which Bardon's later fame was molded.\" \"Bardon, however, did not deign to give Quintscher his due credit, as is so common, unfortunately, with magical authors of secondary intellectual import. Instead, his secretary Otti Votavova presented the situation topsy turvy by claiming, in her novel on Bardon's life, Frabato (a classical example of devotees' kitsch), that in fact it was Quintscher who had been Bardon's acolyte and not vice versa. She even purported that Quintscher spent the last years of his life in concentration camp (some of them in Bardon's company), an insinuation bitterly denied by Quintscher's now deceased son, with whom I had a conversation on this matter a few years ago. In fact, according to his son, Quintscher never even visited a concentration camp. Rather, he died in the very last hours of the war on May 8th, 1945 in Silesia, where he was also buried. But to be fair to Bardon, let it be known that I have it on the word of reliable witnesses that Bardon, when he saw the *Frabato* manuscript, was quite aghast and gave strict injunctions never to publish it - unfortunately to little avail.\" Demons will work with you.

These \"spirits\" appear to be enemy thoughtforms programmed to keep humanity under control. They have simple souls consisting of one to two elements in contrast to the human soul which consists of five. These beings feed off of and obtain their energy from the planets they were assigned to. \"Frabato\" is an autobiography/novel and is highly educational.

Nearly all of the ancient megalithic structures were designed to observe the stars and their movements. The four cardinal points used in ritual are based upon the points of the Zodiac, as are the elements. The Gods referred to the planetary tables as the \"tablets of destiny/fate.\" One interpretation of the number 666 is 6 x 6 x 6= 216. 2,160 years is how long it takes the synetic vernal point to travel through a house of the zodiac. This is the time of an astrological age. \"666, is the number of a man\" Aquarius, the water bearer. This will be the Age of Aquarius, the age of fire, the Age of Satan. Astrology is a very detailed and advanced subject. Most of those who call themselves \"astrologers\" never advance beyond the elementary level. Ninety-five percent of all the books are elementary and this makes astrology look bad. Most of the books available only tell you about the various *methods* of interpretation, they are unable to interpret the information, so they are useless. Important points: • Learn the 12 signs of the zodiac • Learn the symbols Be careful what you believe when learning astrology, if something doesn't apply to you, more than likely it won't apply to anyone else. I have been honest in all my interpretations. Astrology is different from other forms of divination. Astrology goes deep and reveals many things, some which may be unpleasant to say the least. Astrology is brutally truthful and will more than likely change the way you look at life, as it has done for me. I have studied and practiced astrology for over 30 years. Much of what I have learned has been through suffering. As for fate vs. free will, I have found knowing about something before it happens, can sometimes give us an edge in preventing it. Satan has REALLY helped me through some disastrous transits, unscathed. It is always important to do a ritual and ask, if you see bad times coming. WHAT ASTROLOGY CAN DO FOR YOU • Know ahead of time the way the energies in your future will turn. Knowing this will give much insight into the actions you take at any given time. Obviously, you don't want to go out and rob a bank when Saturn will be transiting your 12th house (possible jail time). Jupiter transiting your first house you can get away with it. (I am not advocating anything illegal here; I am just citing an example!) • Use the timing of the universe to assist in your magick. This will work in your favor. For revenge rituals, when Saturn transits the first house of the offending one, or when it is retrograding over his/her personal planets, life will already be hard, use this energy to make it worse or to direct it. 559"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"• Do You want to now what pleases your lover sexually? The placement of Venus reveals a lot about the love/sexual preferences. • Do you want to know someone better than they know themselves? Look at their birth date or better yet, their astrology chart. Through astrology, we can understand what is going on in our lives and have a better understanding of significant others and ourselves. • Astrology will give you knowledge and power over others. You can find out if people are lying to you, cheating on you, in love with you, hate you and much more. The down side is knowing about unpleasantness before it happens. Sometimes we see tragedy in other's charts or in our own. People who can't have children, disastrous marriages, unrequited love, and even death. When you really learn to read the planets, it opens another dimension. Sometimes, things don't always manifest the way we read into them. It is important and *ethical* that you do not reveal anything tragic to others you read for. Satan is ethical and the Demons teach us ethics. There is always the possibility it may not happen the way we expect it to and this is a very nasty thing to do. If I see disaster, I tell the person I am reading for to be careful at certain times. 560"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"Using and Empowering a Black Mirror Scrying can be a useful means to contact Demons and spirits, to foretell the future, and to secure answers to questions. A black mirror is ideal for these purposes. Traditionally, Obsidian was the material of choice in the making of a black mirror, but the method described below works just as well. The cycle of the Full Moon is the best time to create a black mirror, as the moon rules the third eye and psyche. Any frame for a photograph can serve as a base for a black mirror. Take the glass from the picture frame and paint one side of it with black enamel. You will probably need to use several coats of paint. Oil based enamels are lasting, but they can take a long time to dry. Be sure to leave the glass to completely dry before placing it back in the frame. Substitutions for a black mirror include a dark bowl of black liquid or a shiny black object, large enough to focus upon. I have found average everyday mirrors to work in a dimly lit room (candlelight is perfect). The empowering ritual below is for advanced meditators and is very effective. If you are not advanced, you can still use a black mirror with results and wait until you are more experienced to perform the empowering ritual. Empowering Ritual: During a full Moon, go outside if possible, some place where you have a bit of privacy. Go into a slight trance, breathe in energy from the Moon into your third eye on the inhale, and on the exhale, chant \"Inanna\" E-E-E-E-E-N-N-N-N-N-N-A-H-A-H-A-H-A-H-A-H-A-N-N-N-N-N-A-H-A-H-A-H-A-H vibrating, so you can feel it in your third eye. Do this for 30 times, then condense the energy from the Moon in your third eye and circulate this energy to your heart chakra and back to your third eye nine times, ending with the energy temporarily stored in your heart chakra. Place a paper or parchment of the Sigil of Astaroth on top of the face of the black mirror, and place both on your altar. Astaroth is the Goddess of prophesy. Write the following prayer on a clean piece of paper: Hear me Lord Satan, I ask in your name, that the forces of darkness bestow their powers of prophesy upon this mirror; that I may use this magickal medium to contact any Demons I may call forth, to scry upon for the revelation of secrets, and knowledge that is unknown to me. In the name of Satan/Lucifer, I petition Ashtaroth, to bestow the blessing of prophesy and all the powers related, thereof upon this mirror. All of this, I ask in your name, Lord Satan. So it is done. At the height of your ritual, recite the prayer aloud and when finished light it in the flame of a black candle on the left side of your altar. Place the burning paper in a bowl to burn. Now, take the energy stored in your heart chakra and release it into the mirror by exhaling it- chanting g- g- g-g-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh eh-eh-eh The chant/vibration is done with a hard G as in the English word \"Get\" without the ’t.’ The base of your tongue should be as close as possible to the back of your throat when you vibrate the Gebo rune. Gebo is Astaroth’s rune and is used with workings involving powers of the heart chakra. With each exhale, vibrate the energy into your mirror. Visualize the energy entering the mirror. It should indigo (bluish-violet) in color (there may be some green or swirls of it) and grow with intensity upon each exhale. You should be able to judge when the mirror is fully empowered and feel the stored energy leaving you. To use the mirror: Position the mirror so it is at a comfortable level. You should be sitting comfortably when scrying. The room should be quiet and dimly lit, preferably with candlelight. 561"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"To begin a scrying session, enter into a trance, and imagine the mirror is black liquid water, jet-black like a well. Fix your gaze upon the mirror. The mirror will eventually brighten to gray and images of clouds will begin to form. Be patient, for the ability to see images of spirits and events will come with practice. It is best to become familiar with your mirror before calling up any Demons. At first, nearly everyone sees clouds. This is normal and a positive sign. With experience and persistence, one will move onto other visions that will occur at random. These visions will be uncontrolled. With experience, one will be able to call upon visions at will. An adept can experience visions that involve all five senses when scrying into the mirror; this can take some time, persistence and practice. Demons can touch the scryer, carry on lengthy conversations, and interact on a more personal level. The visions can begin to exist outside of the mirror and on all sides and surround the scryer. When not in use, keep the mirror should be wrapped in silk to keep the energy from escaping and kept in a safe place where others will not disturb it. The energy will need to be replenished every so often. You will have to place your mirror in a window or out of doors under a full Moon to absorb the lunar energies. To do this, breathe in energy from the Moon into your heart chakra and exhale it into the mirror from your hand chakras. If you are open, you will see with your third eye, and feel when the mirror is fully empowered, and sense when it needs to be recharged. 562"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Necromancy; Contacting the Dead Many books on witchcraft, séances, channeling, and mediumship advocate an elaborate process in order to contact the deceased. In reality, it is not all that difficult to summon someone who is hanging around on the astral. There are many who are \"lost souls\" and are trapped on the astral. In the case of those who have been reincarnated, if you are in tune enough, you will be able to pick this up and know it is of no use to try to contact them, as they are already in another life. Deceased Humans are \"spirits.\" These are of a lower order. They are not as powerful as Demons or angels, unless the person empowered his/her soul. The astral is usually a lonely place for these souls and often, they wish to make contact with the living. Ghosts that are seen or sensed in old houses (often the person died there), those who cannot part from living family members or loved ones; usually the ghost attaches itself to something - the house, the place of employment, the living family or a surrogate family. There can be unfinished business where the deceased needs help from the living, as with a burial, solving a homicide, missing person or something where the deceased cannot \"rest.\" Most often, the deceased will make him/herself known. Objects can be misplaced, electrical appliances can be turned on or off, he/she can be felt, even by untrained individuals. How to Make Contact: The deceased does not need to be hanging around to establish contact. If he/she is dead, he/she can be contacted, provided he/she has not reincarnated. A summoning can be done at any place where one can focus. Tarot cards can be used to make contact. A Ouija board or pendulum can be used to communicate. In cases where there is a group, all participants should be in tune and serious. One person will act as the medium. 1. The person closest or the nearest in contact with the deceased (in the case of a known spirit), shuffles the cards, concentrating on a reading to contact and give information about the one being summoned. The medium then begins to read the cards. Do the same, if you are substituting a Ouija board. In using a Ouija board, the medium should sit opposite the person wishing to call on the deceased. Having a personal object of the deceased can be a help for those who are inexperienced or not as psychic, who are acting as the medium. 2. Usually the person closest to the deceased will feel him/her before anyone else. The person acting as the medium will draw in the soul and speak for him/her. When finished, direct the soul to depart. Do not bind in any way with the soul. Keep it as impersonal as possible. A Pendulum can also be used. The medium should have some experience with a pendulum, should he/she decide to use this method. Begin by asking if there are any spirits in the room/house/building/area. If the pendulum answers \"yes\" then you can go on to ask more questions or use a Ouija Board to get a conversation going. Human spirits are fairly easy to invoke. They do not in any way have the energy of a Demon, as I have invoked both. The energy from a human, usually, can only be felt when he/she enters your body. A Demon on the other hand is electrifying and the residual energy can make your skin tingle for several days afterward. 563"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"Never try to force the spirit into answering questions they do not wish to answer. Being rude will give your aura a bad vibe on the astral and future attempts at contact or invocation of other spirits may be thwarted. Void meditation is essential here, as is a strong mind and spirit, with total control over your own thoughts and emotions. The ability to turn off and block out anything unwanted is of extreme importance when invoking anything from the astral. Some spirits feed on fear, an untrained mind, or other emotions. People who are fearful, overly impressionable or prone to excessive emotion/hysteria; unstable behavior, should not take part in any séances! One must be cool, calm and collected at all times during a séance. The medium must always remain in total control of the situation. When souls of the departed are contacted, they are as they were when alive. The personalities do not change, at least from the experiences I have had. This is another reason we all should make the most of our life here, as we all need to work toward developing and empowering ourselves spiritually. 564"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Information The “3-Fold Law of Return”- Exposing This Lie The \"Three-fold,\" the \"Ten-fold,\" The One-hundred-fold”; all of these were invented by a few human beings to frighten the masses, in order to maintain spiritual control. With the availability of knowledge in modern times, witchcraft could no longer be suppressed, so the oppressors had to find a way to keep it inline so real power and control can remain in the hands of a few. These few *know* the truth and are adepts in black magick which they use liberally to spiritually enslave the masses. They control the mainstream religions that are nothing but programs to suppress knowledge and control humanity. The article below exposes this lie for what it is: \"The first known reference in print to the three-fold law of return appeared in 1970 in ’Witchcraft Ancient and Modern’ by Raymond Buckland who was initiated into the craft by Gerald Gardner and was instrumental in introducing Gardnerian Witchcraft into the United States.\"¹ With enough research, it is evident that the \"three-fold\" emerged with the \"Gardnerian Tradition.\" Then, we have the \"seven-fold\" and I’m sure everyone has heard of the \"ten-fold.\" My point here is none of this recent man-made nonsense has anything to do with the original religions. Its sole purpose is to keep people from using their inborn power and to promote a passive attitude that is accepting of abuse. This is no different from the Christian Church. This \"three-fold teaching was taken from the eastern concept of \"karma\" after it merged with Western Christianity. After the eastern teachings of karma picked up the Judeo/Christian overtones of divine punishment, the product evolved into yet another system of control with the same theme of keeping power in the hands of a few who know how to use it to exploit humanity. One thing led to another and Gerald Gardner added more to this and promoted the belief that witches must never use their powers to cause harm. Everybody has to take abuse and keep the passive attitude. The Wiccan Rede: \"An it harm none, do what ye will.\" According to Gardner, the \"creed\" is derived from \"Good King Pausol\" who declared, \"Do what you like so long as you harm no one.\" King Pausol is a fictitious character from the French novel by Pierre Louÿs (1870-1925): Les Adventures du Roi Pausole: Pausole (Souverain Paillard et Débonnaire) (1901 and reprinted in 1925 numerous times since), or the Adventures of King Pausole (The Bawdy and Good Natured Sovereign). This is the basis of \"Wicca.\" Wicca is nothing more than a Christianized version of the old religions. Wiccans have taken selected rites and teachings to suit their whims, from the original religions and have twisted, corrupted and transformed them and are now passing themselves off as the original religion. The hypocrisy can be readily seen in the Gods they acknowledge. Many, if not most of these Gods and Goddesses that they claim to worship, were the ones who brought the teachings of magick to humans, both white and black magick. They are known as \"The Fallen Ones.\" The original Horned God is Satan. In addition, few Wiccans bother to do any indepth research regarding the Gods and Goddesses they commune with and worship. Most of these deities are of the Pantheon of Hell. Many Wiccans and modern Pagans also unknowingly mix their deities (Angels with Demons) and this can spell disaster. I read a long list of deities these people claim to worship and it is 565"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"obvious they really know nothing much about them. Most of these writings consist of nothing but double talk, for example: how \"Ishtar\" should be evoked instead of \"Ashtaroth\" even though they are the same Goddess. They claim using the name \"Ashtaroth\" is different, even though they readily admit she is the same Goddess. According to author Raymond Buckland, Wiccans claim their religious roots to be evident in a Paleolithic cave painting of a man dressed in stag skins presumably performing a dance. \"Caverne des Trois Freres at Ariege France\" is the site of this cave painting. It is just that- a man dressed up in animal skins and is no proof of anything. Satanism has often served as the scapegoat for these new age religions and movements, whose adherents view themselves as so good and perfect. Wicca is a Christianized corruption of the old pagan religions. Wicca is the Judeo/Christianized version of witchcraft. One of the major goals of Christianity is to destroy the past and replace it with fictitious versions that conform to the lie of Christianity. Recently, they have been working to turn the religion into a Goddess cult, by gradually getting rid of the Horned God so there will be fewer and fewer ties with the original religions. Wicca is a bogus movement, not based upon the facts, but like Christianity, it is based upon stolen and altered rites and teachings. Like Christianity, it depends upon the ignorance of its followers to thrive.

Much of this is due to humanity as a whole residing on a very low level of spirituality, due to knowledge being forcibly removed and destroyed by the Christian Churches. There is rarely any serious justice and most people are indoctrinated to endure all kinds of injustices and abuse. If everyone were spiritually empowered, there would be a lot more thoughtfulness and consideration for and how we interact with others. Society and the human race as a whole would evolve to a higher level. There are natural laws. One of them is a species or individual for that matter, who is unable to fight back and defend him/herself against others who seriously intend harm will cease to exist. Many species of plants and animals become extinct because they are unable to defend themselves. Our bodies are fighting continuously against invaders in the form of bacteria, viruses, and germs. If our cells stopped fighting and killing harmful invaders, we would quickly become sick and die. This is a fact of life and natural law. Ethics and a certain code of conduct is necessary for civilization to continue and self-control is important. Sometimes someone is having a bad day or things are said or done many times, unintentionally. However, if someone is seriously out to harm you or deprive you of justice, you have an obligation to fight back. Satanists are not victims. The working of Black Magick requires much strength of mind and skill. Wiccans and others of the RHP lack this skill and therefore are at a major disadvantage. The stronger we become in mind, the more powerful we are at all times. Regular power meditation, chakra work, and visualization are essential. One does not need to resort to ritual for retaliation. When we have a strong, focused mind, others will feel the effects when we think intensely of them or when we direct our energies. This is important to remember where family and loved ones are concerned. We all offend each other every now and then, but when we have a powerful mind and aura, we must remember this and be in control. Our anger can cause others to have accidents and misfortune. As for others who are purposely offensive, just focusing on them letting your anger loose, with a strong, well-trained mind, will usually do the job. I have had things happen on my own, without having to do any rituals. 567"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"Black Magick and Mental Health Most of us are familiar with psychiatry, counseling, psychology, and other mental health services. The methods used are standard. Most professionals prod the patient into expressing repressed feelings- anger, hatred, envy, resentment and related emotions, including repressed sexuality and sexual feelings. Acknowledging these repressed emotions sheds new light on the origins of serious hang-ups, neuroses, compulsions/obsessions and other serious mental health disorders. Many physical ailments are brought about by repressed emotions. Some of these end in death. These have a very detrimental effect upon one’s soul and spiritual being as well. The New Age movement, Wicca, many eastern religions (Such as modern Buddhism, which have been Judeo/Christianized), and others all advocate denial of expressing so-called \"baser\" emotions. This leads to poor mental health and worse. Catholic priests are a blatant example of the consequences of sexual repression. Sexual repression is about the worst, as the sex drive is as powerful as and is tied directly to the life force, it doesn’t just go away. Anything that is repressed comes out in warped, distorted, and unhealthy ways. Many problems would be avoided if people would vent their feelings and stop repressing them. This isn’t about going on a rampage, it is just acknowledging one’s own feelings and letting them out. One should always be honest with one’s self. By denying anger, hatred, jealousy, and other so-called \"negative\" emotions, one is laying a pattern for serious problems down the road. People who claim to love, love, and love, and deny their anger and hatred, take on that artificial alien deadpan smile that is so common amongst Christians in the advanced stages of Christianity. Inside, these people are extremely unbalanced and are literally like grenades with the pins pulled, just waiting to explode, either turning their pent up anger out on others or in upon themselves. This is extremely unhealthy. Yet, they consistently excuse the hatred and wrathful behavior of the false god they worship. This sets the stage for serious mental illness. Another common teaching is denial of materialism. The reason for this is so wealth and power can be kept in the hands of a few- the same people at the top who work to remove spiritual knowledge and replace it with Christianity and other lies. Material possessions make life more enjoyable and are an extension of ourselves. There should be a healthy balance between spiritualism and materialism. The merging of the material with the spiritual is the key to attaining the godhead of the soul. No one has a right to dictate to others how they should feel about someone or something. Ritual is often an excellent means of venting emotions. Anything that is consciously and intentionally repressed will cause serious problems later on. 568"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"The Black Arts I have been placing emphasis on the black arts, because there is little information available on the subject, as opposed to the white magick books and writings. In order to have true power, one must be adept at both. This takes time, patience, and a lot of hard work. Many people often wonder why their spell workings have failed. This is because one’s mind and aura are weak. Sure, we can go to Satan and his Demons when we are in need, but the goal of Satanism is to become powerful ourselves. Satan and his Demons guide us and give us the knowledge we need to increase our powers. Satan does not waste his time on those who do nothing with themselves. True Satanism is not Disneyland. If you want serious power, you will have to work hard at it. This can take years, but is well worth the effort. We save our own souls. There is time we can all squeeze in with a bit of organization. Do what you can do. Breathing exercises only take around ten minutes and are very effective in increasing one’s powers. They can be done first thing in the morning or even in the bathroom if you lock the door (if one lives in a full house). Even five minutes of visualization exercises, a day will bring many benefits. Meditation is being in the here and now; emptying your mind of all thoughts. This can be done anywhere and at anytime. Much can be done with a well-trained mind. For example: Knowledge of anatomy gives one the ability to either heal or inflict harm. Nerves can cause pain, if one focuses upon them in a hated one. This is one of many examples. You can also open and access other areas of your brain that are dormant in most human beings and empower these areas by focusing on them and attempting to use the abilities they provide when activated. Thoughts can be placed in another person’s head the same way. Concentration and repetition are necessary here. For those who do not as of yet have enough power, many times a spell or ritual can be repeated on consecutive nights, with the cycle of the Moon. Spells for growth and increase should be performed during a waxing moon, while spells for destruction should be performed during a waning moon. In some cases, spells may need to be repeated. When a working is successful, you should know it and there is usually no more need to repeat it. For those who like to do their workings outdoors, the earth has vast energy reserves for people who know how to manipulate energy. The use of a pendulum can prove invaluable. Obtaining consistently accurate answers from a pendulum takes much practice and patience. One can begin with a map of a suitable area that is secluded for ritual work. By using a pencil in one hand and a pendulum in the other, a series of yes/no, questions can be asked to pinpoint a spot. The pendulum will begin to move rapidly in circles when taken to a spot out of doors where there are natural lines of earth energy. Stones can be used to enhance a circle of power. The circle of power is for building and concentrating your energies before directing them at the desired goal. Stones containing quartz increase the power of the energies in the circle and act as transmitters. Circles are also used for protection and as barriers. Always remember, after any black magickal working to clean your aura and your chakras with either a bright light, as that of the sun. When we use and draw upon negative or destructive energy, a residue can remain clinging to our auras. If this is left, it can cause problems, as energy tends to attract energy of the same wavelength. This is especially true with those who due to a lack of knowledge, invoke energy, instead of evoking it and then use it for destruction, thus creating a tie. Taking the time to clean your aura will rid your soul of anything negative that could cause you problems. Take your time at this. 569"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"When you are able to see your aura brightened and your chakras as well, then ask your pendulum if you are completely cleansed. If not, ask what needs more work, going through your chakras one by one with yes/no questions that the pendulum is able to answer. When finished with ANY ritual, it is important not to think about the ritual or your desired goal. Let the ritual alone to do its work, as dwelling, worrying or rehearsing the working can manifest the wrong energies and interfere. When we worry, or dwell on the outcome, we can sometimes alter the results we worked to influence. This is where void meditation is essential. Regular practice of void meditation gives us the ability to turn off unwanted thoughts and influences. Workings of revenge and black magick are best done when the hated one is asleep. During sleep, the victim’s psychic defenses are down and the subconscious/suggestive mind is wide open. Everyone should cleanse his/her aura and chakras on a daily basis. This is as essential as regular bathing. Unfortunately, due to the systematic removal of spiritual knowledge, few people know about their own souls, how to properly care for or keep them healthy. This can be done upon awaking, doesn’t take long, and can prevent illness, psychic attack and other negative energies from getting a hold. It will also enhance your charisma when interacting with others. 570"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"The Elements and Magick The ritual tools should help in directing the elements. The rod is for fire, the sword, for air. Sex magick- orgasm produces fluids- works for water magick like for love. The pentagram represents us humans. The earth element ties all of the other elements. This is one of the messages of the Satanic point down pentagram, the power of the invoked earth element. The pentagram is US as human beings, not some altar decoration. Fire Magick is amplified with invoking and directing the fire element. Fire magick includes: Confidence, fame, success in gambling, pleasure, securing popularity/charisma, increasing health and vitality, healing, protection, success, magickal power, creativity, enthusiasm, energy, stamina, major changes, adaptability, attraction, sudden changes, stimulation, enthusiasm, creativity, energy, gaining control, changing luck and inciting justice. Revenge, anger, pure sexual lust, and physical gratification, courage, determination, dealing with enemies. Inciting accidents, fires, injuries. Self-confidence, athletics, strength, magickal energy for Black Magick, intensity. Incites lust, energy, strength, sexual energy, dynamism, passionate love, physical desire, courage, will power, and athletics (especially competitive). Good for self-empowerment before workings of black magick. When used in black magick, fire as opposed earth is used to bring on sudden attacks, accidents, bloodshed, violence, and hatred. Fire can also be used to incite wars, anarchy, and cruelty. Properly evoking and directing the fire element will raise the temperature in whatever it is directed to. Water Magick is sex magick and any magick where body fluids are used. Sex magick can be used with other elements as well, but is ruled by the water element. Water magick is amplified through invoking the water element and includes: Healing, love, making love, (affectionate; fire is for lust/sex), fidelity, reconciliation, beauty, youth, friendships, attraction, harmony, social functions, indulgence, pleasure. Meditation, psychic ability, telepathy, mind reading, Spirit communication, absorbing knowledge telepathically. Good for beginnings and growth. The home and immediate surroundings, imagination, memory, psychic awareness/dreams, spirituality, meditation. For psychic related, meditative/hypnotic, fertility, marriage, and balance. Inciting jealousy, greed, suspicion, resentment, sickness, disease, and disharmony. Water when directed to another can cause one to be overly emotional, have violent reactions, lash out, and have a very difficult time with being objective. Earth Magick is amplified through invoking and directing the earth element and includes: Money, fertility, abundance, material gain, wealth, healing, communication with nature spirits, financial gain, earnings increases, possessions, riches, indulgence, pleasure. The earth element is used in death rituals and can be used along with death energy, used in binding rituals, and to absorb, conceal, for self control, endurance, and patience. Air Magick is amplified through invoking the air element and includes: Intellect, computers, communication, audio, video, TV, electronics, books, literature. The Will. For passing exams, improving the mind, concentration, mental power, learning ability, speech, writing, publishing, media concerns, gossip, slander, interviews, brothers, sisters, neighbors, rumors, theft, all areas of study and communication, also astral projection, overcoming addictions, breaking habits. Good for friendship, imagination, creativity inspiration, and charisma. Air also incites confusion, chaos, irritability, nervousness, nervous exhaustion, arguments, and discord. 571"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"Using Props People have used props for thousands of years to assist in their focus during magickal workings. Poppets, herbs that burn and sting to induce pain and anger, stone circles, anything that would induce the right mood, help to incite and intensify the right emotions, and help to direct one’s energy and focus are known as \"props.\" One should be powerful enough to influence one’s environment using the power of one’s mind alone without having to rely upon props. Props definitely help in beginning magick as they provide a focus. Advanced working with props is a different matter and requires infusing them with energy or binding thoughtforms or souls into them. Here is where props have real power and can become magickal assistants within themselves. 572"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"Concentration Total focus is essential in all magickal workings. It doesn’t matter if the environment is full of distractions, one should always maintain total focus. This comes with having a trained mind. I was involved in an ongoing project- freeing the Demons.* My Guardian Demon, Azazel, and Thoth came to me as they were working with me. Thoth was the Patron Demon of our project and he accompanied each of our Guardian Demons, bringing each Demon to be freed. Glasya-Labolas needed to be freed right away. My daughter was in my room watching TV and there was a lot of commotion in my house. I told them I would have to wait until later. Five minutes or so later, my daughter’s puppy urinated on my bed. I had to strip the bed and wash the bedding. Because of this, everyone had to leave my room. When Demons want something done, things seem to fall into place. I went into my room, locked the door, and began to work on Glasya-Labolas. My kids were fighting, banging on the door and other kids came over and the house was a madhouse, but I tuned out all of the commotion, and successfully freed him. Total focus should always be maintained regardless of how intense distractions may be. Just keep doing what you are doing without letting outside distractions interfere. Of course, any doors should always be locked. When we focus and concentrate to where we are not even aware of anything going on around us, this is when we have the most power. *From mid-December of 2002 through mid-April of 2003, five of us freed over 100 Demons. This was accomplished through sex magick. At the point of orgasm, we connected our souls to the souls of each of the Demons and transferred energy from each of our chakras to their chakras. This was a very rewarding experience. After the energy was transferred, each one bolted angel wings. 573"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"The Importance of Enviornment Back in 1534, Benvenuto Cellini, an Italian Renaissance painter wanted to experience a \"magickal operation.\" He met with a Sicilian priest versed in the art of ritual magick, a friend Vincentio Romoli, a 12-year-old boy, and a second magician, accompanying the priest. Cellini wanted the love of a woman. Of all the places to choose for a ritual, they went to the Roman Coliseum. They cast a nine-foot circle and after an hour and a half, some spirits showed up and communicated to the group. They related that Cellini would have his love within one month. Then something went terribly wrong. More and more spiritual entities kept coming and then began getting aggressive. Within a short time, \"there were too many spirits present.\" The 12-year-old boy screamed, \"They were all being menaced by a million of the fiercest men they had ever seen.\" \"Four giants, fully armed, were trying to force their way into the circle.\" The child cried out that \"the Coliseum was on fire and that flames were rolling towards them.\" The group huddled together in terror, the magician threw more asafoetida on the fire in piles, and after a while, the spirits left in a fury. The group stayed huddled until morning and only a few spirits remained \"and these at a distance.\" Upon leaving and running home, a couple of spirits chased them. The Roman Coliseum of all places was a very poor choice for a love ritual. One person dying a violent death gives off negative energy, but thousands of violent deaths along with the all of the death emotions- the Gladiators, lions and other wild animals ripping people to shreds, and the intense violence leaves its mark for centuries. A proper environment with energy that is in tune with the goals of the ritual is important, obviously unwanted influences can affect a ritual or magickal operation for the worst. Music, thoughts, recalling past experiences or fantasies are important as well to creating a mood and environment supportive to the goals of the ritual.

In order to practice powerful witchcraft using herbs, the herbs must be infused with power. This is advanced magick and requires the ability to invoke/evoke and direct the elements. Each herb carries elemental properties that correspond to its medicinal uses. These can be found under planetary rulerships. In addition, to really empower herbs, planetary hours should be observed to amplify any working. Various mediums are used during any ritual or magickal working. For example, the proper candles act as a beacon to spirits and the proper uses of various colors, imagery, and herbs can assist the effectiveness of a working. Herbs have long been employed in the workings of magick. Through the power of scent; incense, perfume, herbal oils used for anointing one’s self, anointing candles, sigils and talismans; purification bathing before ritual, and with some, ingestion. • The flower parts are used for scents or in the stuffing of poppets, sachets, and pillows or for a bath water additive. • The wood parts can be used to construct implements and tools for magickal purposes. • The leaves are very versatile and can be used in the making of ointments, oils, bathing, and the stuffing of poppets, pillows, steeped and drunk as a tea- MAKE SURE IT ISN’T POISONOUS AND YOU AREN’T ALLERGIC TO IT! • Aromatic gums or resins, along with the wood, bark, and oils can be burnt as incense. It is always a good idea to burn some incense as a test before any important ritual to determine how well it burns, and the quality of the fragrance. Bad incense can be a major distraction and can ruin an entire ritual, not to neglect in mentioning, being offensive to the spirits. Incense, like candles, provides a favorable environment for the manifestation of spirits, for the affecting of the psyche and the attraction of the appropriate planetary and zodiac force. It is essential to coordinate these elements. Certain scents are employed to act on the mind during ritual. These odors can stimulate any emotion from anger and extreme rage, to sexual arousal and lust, to peace, relaxation, and tranquility. The use of scents assists in heightening the emotional output needed to give enough power to the working so that it will manifest in reality. Oil is for anointing one’s body, and can be added to bath water before a ritual. Candles can be anointed to create the added fragrance, as the flame will give off a stronger scent. Strong oils can be used to anoint the areas of the chakras, and are used in ointments that can be rubbed upon one’s body for certain effects. Balsams are the fragrant drippings from certain trees and plants. These can be made into ointments and used as a rub for one’s body or object of purpose. The purpose of rubbing one’s self with oils, balsams, or resins is to induce the proper mood for ritual work. For example, plants ruled by Mars are fiery, burning, and acrid. When the oil, balsam, or resin is applied under the armpits or other sensitive areas of the body, it will incite the wrath and hatred needed in spells of revenge and torment, as it will encourage a strong focus on pain and misery. Plants ruled by Venus can be used in workings of love spells the same way, as they stimulate and sooth. 575"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"Plants that have properties as aphrodisiacs, causing extreme sexual arousal are good for spell work in inciting lust in another person of choice. The increased arousal is focused upon the person desired. With stronger and/or multiple orgasms; the energy thereof, being properly directed into the desired one, the spell is that much more potent. Herbs correspond to zodiac signs, planets, and the elements. Fresh plants contain the most energy. If you are using fresh plants, try to pick them when the planet they are influenced by is strong and waxing in power. Here is a brief listing of some herbs and their various uses: Acacia: The flowers can be used in divination, love magick and for trance. Aloe: Guards against accidents, brings luck and protection. Parts used are the juices and the gum. Infuse with white-gold energy taken from the Sun and program the energy to protect. Ambergris: Used for works of wrath and vengeance, psychic correspondence. Used as a fixative. Parts used are the oil. For wrath and vengeance, infuse with fire when the planet Mars is strongly placed and waxing. Apple: Used in love spells. The wood from the tree can be used; seeds. For love workings, the parts used should be infused with the water element to begin with. Following, orgasmic energy, energy from the sexual and heart chakras and sexual fluids should be infused. The planet Venus should be strongly placed and waxing in power. Ash: Wands for the securing of prosperity or for the use in works concerning death can be made from the wood. For death, infuse with the element of earth when the planet Saturn is strongly placed and waxing. The working should be performed during a waning Moon. Benzoin: The wood and balsams are used for incense, oils, and sachets. Benzoin is good for use in séances, incantations, and love matters. For psychic work, infuse with the elements of water, and quintessence. Birch: Birch oil is oil of wintergreen. Wands can be made from the wood for use in spells of vengeance and punishment but should always be infused with the proper elemental energy. The element of fire is usually used with wands. The fragrance can also be used in such workings. Borage: Borage can be used for attracting money and business success. The parts used are the leaves, the flowers, and the stems. It should be infused with the earth element. Burdock: The root is used in spells for protection. It can be burnt. Infuse with white-gold energy taken from the Sun and program the energy to protect. Chamomile: Chamomile can be taken as a tea to act as a relaxant in psychic work. It can also be used in sachets and pillows for psychic dreams and the prevention of nightmares. It is a good herb for bathing. For psychic work, infuse with the elements of water, and quintessence when the Moon is full. 576"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"Catnip: Catnip can be used as a relaxant for psychic work.

Different colors attract different energies and stimulate certain vibrations in the chakras. Using candles of specific colors can help to amplify the energies in ritual and spell work. Black Candles are all-purpose for any Satanic rituals. Black candles used in workings of destruction are used to incite the slower destruction of enemies, opposed to accidents or sudden attacks associated with the color red. Black is also a good color to use to bring discord and confusion to enemies. Black can be used for protection, binding negative forces, and breaking up obstacles and blocks. Black can also be used to reverse and break up negative thoughtforms. Black absorbs, conceals, creates confusion and chaos, is used for new beginnings, and obtaining knowledge of hidden things.

Always make sure to check your candle as a test as you would with incense before beginning a ritual. Bad odors or burning the wrong way as with cheap incense can ruin a ritual. 584"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"Working Rituals and Spells Outdoors There is a lot to be said for performing rituals and magick outdoors. The earth energies act to enhance one’s inner energy and ability. A quiet place should be selected where one is free from distractions. Using a pendulum to locate an area is also a help. One should be adept with pendulums as they can give \"off\" readings to those who are less experienced. To use a pendulum, open a map of the area in which you wish to use and point with a pencil, pen or whatever to specific locations on the map, asking the pendulum whether or not the specific location would be supportive of your workings. You can also ask the pendulum where the most powerful earth energies are located. Take your pendulum to the spot and walk around. If intense earth energies are present, your pendulum will begin to circle. Over really potent spots, it will nearly circle so fast, it will go into a spin. Stone circles are ideal for enhancing earth energies and for a place to build your psychic energies and powers. The color of the stones is important (see the chapter on color). Using brown stones will amplify the earth energy to be directed into your working. Brown stones will also amplify your psychic ability and attract earth spirits. You should begin by marking your area and placing your stones around the marked area. There should also be four points within your circle where you will invoke the Four Crowned Princes of Hell (and invoke the four elements for advanced mages). These four points should correspond to directions as you would for a standard ritual. Lighted candles should be at the four points. You can also invite Demon friends into the circle with you. You should be able to feel their presence, or for those of us who are advanced, to see them in the circle with you. After you have assembled your circle and are ready to begin, it is important to breathe in form the earth and visualize a powerful electric blue light coming up from your feet and into your hand, holding the athame. Point the athame, direct the light to the tip, and mark your circle, visualizing the blue light and drawing a counterclockwise circle with it. The energies raised need to be directed to your specific goal. When they peak, gather them into a glowing ball or other form of your choosing, send the form on its way with instructions, and visualize the energy penetrating your target. When you are finished, blow out the candles, north, then west, south then east. Using your index finger pointing, erase all of the blue light of the circle, moving clockwise in a smooth, slow sweep. Thank your Demon friends (if you had any accompany you) and scatter the stones. You can also use the power of a stone circle to meditate in. This will act to enhance your energy. Meditation can be done sitting or lying down. Use the blue light for all of your workings. Satanism is one with nature. 585"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"The Four Cardinal Points and What They Mean Each cardinal point is not only associated with a specific Demon/ess, but also with an element, ritual tool, color and quality. NORTH The north has always been known as a source of great power. The “heavens” revolved around the North Star. The ancient peoples aligned their temples with this star. The sun never touched the cardinal point north. It was associated with darkness, mystery and the unknown. Because of the Pagan reverence for north, the xtian church associated it with the Devil. Graveyards were seldom, if ever placed on the north side of a church. The north side was used for unbaptized children, criminals, reprobates, and suicides. Many churches throughout Europe have a north door called “the Devil’s door” which was traditionally opened after baptisms to “let the exorcised Demon escape.” Most of these doors have been long since bricked up. The north is associated with the element of earth, the new phase of the moon, the pentagram, darkness, secrecy, and the color black. Some people align their altars to the north. SOUTH Solar energy, the sun, the color red, the magick wand and the element of fire are associated with the south. This is the quarter of the will, directing and channeling the psychic energy and forces of nature. Water running south has long been known to have magickal properties and was a popular ingredient that medieval witches used in their spells. The south represents intellect and knowledge and attainment as the sun reaches its climax in the southern sky (for northerners anyway). EAST The east is the quarter of illumination, enlightenment, the mystical, and the eternal. It is of the element of air, the athame, the color silver, and the morning star, which is Lucifer’s star. In most traditions, the altar is aligned to the east. When a circle is cast for a coven, the High Priest/ess usually positions the gate for everyone to enter in, at the northeast. WEST The element of water represents the subconscious, emotions, the chalice, the color blue, and the psyche. It rules over mediumship, spirit contact, and telepathic communication. 586"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"Planetary Hours Planetary Hours of the Day Hour Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday 6 (approximate sunrise) Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn 7 Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter 8 Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars 9 Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun 10 Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus 11 Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury 12 Noon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon 13 (1 pm) Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn 14 (2 pm) Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter 15 (3 pm) Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars 16 (4 pm) Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun 17 (5 pm) Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus 587"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Planetary Hours of the Night Hours Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday 18 (6 pm) Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury 19 (7 pm) Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon 20 (8 pm) Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn 21 (9 pm) Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter 22 (10 pm) Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars 21 (11 pm) Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Midnight Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus 1 Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury 2 Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon 3 Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn 4 Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter 5 Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Sun Moon Mars 588"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"Moon Phrases and Signs in Magickal Practice Timing your magick with the phases of the Moon is essential for success. A rule of thumb is to remember for white magick, this is best done while the moon is waxing (increasing in light; new to full). The best time is as close to the full moon as possible. Love spells, acquiring a new job, wealth success, and so forth. When the moon is waning (decreasing in light; full to new), this is the best time for success in black magick and works of destruction, the best time being as close to the new moon as possible. The waning moon is also a good time for ending things, banishing spells and ending personal bad habits, losing weight. Moon in Aries Projects begun when the moon is in Aries often begin with much enthusiasm, but tend not to last. This is a good time for inciting conflicts, high energy, me, mine, war, knives, weapons, guns, quick but not lasting results, fire, sharp things, metals, daring, sticking up for yourself, risk taking, independence and inciting accidents. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the head or face at this time. Magick ruled by Mars has the best outcome at this time. Moon in Taurus Projects begun when the moon is in Taurus are usually permanent or long lasting, especially when performed in when the moon is in the first ten degrees of the sign. Money, finances, possessions, material things, sensuality, earth, greed, permanence, wealth, things that increase in value, loans, bankers, slow but lasting results, time delays. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the neck or throat at this time. Magick ruled by the Earth and Venus are successful at this time. Moon in Gemini Communications, short distance travel, a Gemini Moon is dualistic in nature and rules over thievery, trickery, pulling a fast one, relatives, siblings and neighbors, and computers. Gemini lacks staying power and projects begun when moon is in this sign tend to change. Not a good sign for black magickal workings. More neutral in nature. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the shoulders, arms, hands, or nerves at this time. Magick ruled by Mercury has the best outcome at this time. Moon in Cancer Cancer rules over anything to do with the home, family, food, nurturing, the mother, women in general. Things tend to last, as Cancer is a clingy sign. Good for love spells, weather spells, altar consecration, blessing the home, mediumship, psychic endeavors, inciting over-emotionalism. Spells for the success in buying land, purchasing real estate, a decent place to live, and reconciling family members are best performed when the Moon is in this sign. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the stomach at this time. With love relationships or marriages begun when the moon is in Cancer, if the parties break up, they often tend to reunite. Magick corresponding to the Moon is successful at this time. Moon in Leo Good for anything having to do with children, creativity, good for casting love spells; romance, success in gambling, winning, attracting center stage, personal charisma, men in general, the father, hobbies, speculation, risk taking, investments, stocks and bonds, authority and spells for gaining positions of power and authority over others. Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the heart, spine, or back at this time. Leo is a fixed sign and projects begun when the moon is in this sign tend to last.

Do NOT have surgical procedures performed on the feet at this time. 590"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"Timing Your Magick; Avoiding a Void of Course Moon Timing is everything and doing something at the wrong time can screw up everything. The universe is working either for you, or against you. Knowing this can enhance your power. A void of course Moon occurs every couple of days or so. This is when the Moon finishes making its last aspect to any other planets before it enters the next sign. Normally, this lasts a few hours, unless all of the other planets are in early degrees. The important thing to know is START SOMETHING ON A VOID MOON AND IT WON’T WORK OUT. Projects begun, papers signed, items purchased, spells cast; everything done at this time has more than a tendency to go wrong. Projects begun during a void of course moon somehow never get finished or are prevented from reaching completion. Crimes committed during this time are rarely brought to justice. Applying for a job or going for an interview during a void moon and more than likely, you can forget about getting hired. Plans made during this time get altered. Clothing bought may not fit properly or is never worn. Taking out a loan during this time and chances are, you may never have to pay it back. This is the time the universe is full of loopholes. The rule of thumb is what is begun during this time is rarely completed. In many cases, this is a time to get away with things. This is NOT a time to perform spells, as they will not work out. They will be ineffective. For information as to when the Moon is void, many yearly books are available. Llewellyn’s Moon sign book comes out annually and has this info. This can be purchased almost everywhere and is inexpensive. Ephemerides also contain this information for those of us who know how to read them. 591"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"Timing Your Magick with the Planets Like the Void of Course Moon, there are times when the energies of the universe are working against us. When certain planets retrograde, the planets and what they represent throw contrary energies. When Mercury is retrograde, workings to acquire knowledge, truth, intellect; to pass exams and everything related to the mind, communication, travel, education, literary, electronics and everything else ruled by Mercury, the odds are greatly against the success of such things. Performing spells/magick related to these things will more than likely result in failure. When Venus is retrograde, this is not a good time for love, relationships, commitment, artistic pursuits and so on. Love spells will inevitably fail or result in disaster.
