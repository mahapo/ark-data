Thabet Tase are the malignant spirits of women who have died during childbirth, and these come back from the dead as succubi.

The Thaye Tase are grotesque looking giants manifesting themselves most frequently during the epidemics of smallpox and cholera. They are the souls of those who died a violent death.

Tengu - T he Tengu is a Japanese demon mentioned in written sources going as far back as the eighth century and in contemporary Japanese chronicles. In early times the Tengu often manifested himself as a crow, or as a man with a crow's beak. In medieval times, haughty and insincere Buddhi st monks were said to be reborn as Tengu. In t he course of time the crow's beak of the demon gave way to a more human looking shape; namely a large, round, re d nose. But beak or nos e, the importance of this organ depends on its size, which is directly proport ional to the demon’s powers. This relationship allows any aware person to judge the strength of an attacking Tengu at first sight, so that appropri ate precautions can be taken. Although hum an in form, the Tengu is a winged creature, his fingers and toes ending in long and extremely sharp nails. Tengu has often been seen by mountain people who claim that he fells trees and flutters around c ackling madly. He appears at times clad in the shabby garb of a strolling monk, carrying a fan, a stick, and a sword. He does not seem to have any definite predilection for a ny particular evil deed, yet he appears to be quite an imaginative character who is able to use just about any given situation to commit his crimes. Some of his actions resemble the mischief of the European poltergeist. He has also been know n, especially by the mountain people, to indulge in kidnappings. The first instance of someone abducted by a Tengu swooping down from the sky goes back to the fourteenth century. Even nowadays, when a child is lost, the village people assemble to beat drums, calling upon t he Tengu to bring it back. Thamiel - Also know n as Thaumiel.

He is flanked on either side of his throne by the bodiless heads of two demons. The female head is able to detect the most secret flaws in the sinners who are brought in front of Yama, while the male head is able to assess sins by smelling them. Around Yama are assembled his multitude of 'eyes' called Tevodas, who are the witnesses that testify to a person's sins. In Hindu legend, Yama was the first mortal to die because he travelled down the road from whence there is no return. He dwells in Pitris with his wife Yami, who is his own sister. The souls of the departed are brought to Yama in crowds by Agni, the emanation of the funeral pyre.
