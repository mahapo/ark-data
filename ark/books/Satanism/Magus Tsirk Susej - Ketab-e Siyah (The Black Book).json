When yet was the world of old new-born And the first winter's snow, like blossom Had not yet fallen, shrouding the grass of the first spring, Then was I the noblest of all the angels, The noble potentates of supreme Heaven. To God alone was my fealty owed, And all others, to me, theirs. For, of all the shining sons of Heaven, The King of the World loved me best. I was adorned in gilded brilliance Brighter than the noonday sun of Arabia. A robe woven of a hundred diamonds Wrapped round my princely shoulders. To me were there seven hundred concubines. They were more beautiful than loti or roses, Their caresses softer than Sinaean silks, Their embraces warmer than furs from Russia. My gardens were more verdant than the forests of Brazil, More opulent than the Sultan's or Babylon's. They were most populous with cedar and ebon And boats made as swans plied the waters"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Of rivers filled with fish of silver scales That darted forth and back, faster than arrows. It was my custom to hunt there, Upon a stallion of marble-white, So proud that I alone could ride the intemperate steed, Seeking with lance and bow, Camelopards, monoceri and other wonderful beasts That as the sun, of purest white, Declined and blushed in the western sky I should feast on many wonderful meats, And drink wine, as sweet as nectar, Pressed from my fecund vineyards' grapes. My temple-palace was less than none But the platinum throne of God himself. Three nights riding, upon the fastest steed, Would barely encircle its outmost wall. Its highest spire looked down upon mountains, Giant and high, yet low to my towers. The masonry of my exalted dominion Was gilded all, and studded with precious jewels, Of number and radiance to outshine the celestial arch. My will and word commanded authority greater than all, Than any regent amongst man or angel. My word instructed, in their course, the planets of the sky. The sun, most radiant of the treasures of the sky, All-illumining and burning with golden flame, At my bidding would hide beneath the eastern horizon Or flee to the horizon to the west. To speed or halt or turn back the sun Was my prerogative and pleasure. My rod commanded also the silver moon, That lights night's shadow with virginal beams. I could make her wax or wane as I willed. Others too knelt to my vice regency: Crimson Mars and gentle Venus, Swift Mercury of the dawn's new light, Mighty Jupiter and his four-fold train And dim Saturn who augurs ill. The seas I commanded with a hand, Directing their tides to grow and fall. A dozen dozen myriads of angels were my thegns"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 That rode at my left, at my right, at my back. Indeed was my glory most great! Most beautiful and most noble was I, and am, And the high favour bestowed upon my name By the Architect of Creation Stirred, in the hearts of my lesser kin, Treacherous envy and vile malice, Inspiring them to plot injury to me, And nursed the sundrance of that august kingdom And brought to maturity a terrible transgression Against all bonds of love and piety. Second to me in rank, age and father's favour, My brother Michael gathered to him the angels of God Whose souls and minds were too perverted By the traitorous intentions that consumed them. O woe to them who sought to destroy me, They are themselves damned to destruction, Consumed by their own, vain hatred. Having gathered those unfit angels to him Thus did Michael address them, Speaking with words of poisoned nectar: \"My brothers, who are most beloved to me, Woe that I must speak such words as these! How it sorrows my heart that this kingdom of ours Should endure to hear me speak these words. Rather, I should have it, that the world split asunder Than that I must speak this dire report. Yet it must be spoken. Our dearest brother, Satanael, the best of us, He whom we all honour above all others, He who shines most bright amongst us, Has betrayed us, our kingdom and our Father. With his clever speech and cunning deceit Has he blinded our Father to his evil, Seducing that most great and noble king, Worthy of naught but love and fealty, And, serpent that he is, brought low That which is upraised above all. Slyly has he spoken and secured for himself The greatest share of our Father's favours,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Speaking against us with slander and malice And robbing us of what is our right. We who love our Father above all, Who are more exacting of ourselves in filial duty Than that unworthy fox that now undoes us, That makes dark those bright eyes of infinite kindness That blinds Him to the perfidy of the malefactor, And to love of those who, though less noble, Cherish Him better than he who should cherish Him best. Hatred comes to fruition in my heart for Satanael Who surely is the Prince of Lies. We must act before his spell is done And he stirs our Father's heart beyond deliverance Against those who would deliver him From the evil of his best-loved son. We must go to our most beloved Father And petition with him to hear our sorry news Of the treachery of our brother Who is not fit to call himself Elohim. We must bring an prosecution Before Satan brings his own false accusation, Spoken through lips black with deceit. We must open our Father's eyes To this most terrible crime before it is complete And He and we are ruined by it.\" Lo! They acclaimed Michael's false counsel For their own malice ruled their ears And governed the intent of their hearts. From the throng, crying out for vengeance For the uncommitted crime that I had done, Came the voice of Raphael, the third of the brothers For they were my brethren no more. \"What crime?\" he inquired \"What charge Are we to bring before the King Most High Against our perfidious brother Whose heart is so black, stinking of corruption.

How can we win in this most dire hour And see justice done against the treasoner? Michael you are wise and have shown That you have insight into many things. What charge, then, are we to bring That all will get their deserved ends And right will triumph over ill?\" Michael in reply spoke thus, With all ears listening to his lies And minds judging, in their greed, If his device should win them what they sought, The favour of the father that favoured me: \"You are right indeed my brother And your report is wholly just and true But were the charge any less than the heinous sin That soon shall I expound to you I should not have gathered you as I have. This is our brother's most awful sin: He intends, in his ambition most perverse, The overthrow of God Himself And to usurp the Creator's crown Making himself king of all.

This is why you are thus gathered.\" Lo! They acclaimed Michael's false counsel For their own malice ruled their ears And governed the intent of their hearts. From the throng, crying out for vengeance For the uncommitted crime that I had done, Came the voice of Auriel, the fourth of the brothers For they were my brethren no more. \"What proof?\" He inquired. \"What proof Shall we bring to make firm our prosecution So that with cunning and clever words The Adversary cannot escaped his deserved fate? What arguments can we devise That can thwart his and overthrow him And give us victory in God's judicious court? How shall we bring testament to his evil And thus stem its monstrous tide? If we cannot bring proof of his sin Then how can we deliver our Father From the serpent's tongue? Yet what proof is there of his guilt That we can show before our Lord Whose eyes see all truth And yet now see not this perfidy That has the seed of ruin in its cankered womb.

Yet also it dismays me that this is so And his tongue is so clever that it thus deceives We whose wisdom can know all truth. Yet I am not so befuddled By the serpent and his cunning speech For I am less in power to only him and God And so cannot be thus enspelled by him But there is no shame for you lesser ones Who had not the wisdom or the strength, Given to you by birth and blood, To penetrate the falsehood of the wholly false. Yet let me awaken you from Satan's glamour And show you the truth in what has come to be. Cast back your minds with knowing eyes To pierce through all the perjurer's design And see the truth of both his hand and voice. Thus you all are witnesses to his crime, Though well he has concealed it.

We are testaments all And shall all proclaim Satanael's awful guilt. For can our Father, in His great sagacity, Refute the report of all his sons That cry out for justice against such treason? Let us then go to Him and bring our case Before time has run its course to our defeat. Gabriel, you are the swiftest of us, Fly on before, on gilded wings of wind Swifter than a hurricane, And bring this dire report to God Before he is yet further wronged By him that was our brother.\" Thus did Michael win the hearts of Heaven's hosts, Turning them against their vice-regent And rousing them to perverse rebellion And to their ruinous defeat. They raised their voices in a cry Calling for terrible vengeance against me In their cankered envy, Eating at their souls from within And making virtue into vice. Thus fell the dominion of the Elohim. Gabriel rose high above the Elohim below And, upon swift wings of purest gold, Flew straight and quick to the silver spire That was the Eternal Tower Where God held court upon his pristine throne. Before that august minaret Did he alight upon the earth And thence enter in by gates of pearl, Stolen from the ancient, coral shell That armoured the back of that primal beast, Most archaic and fearful Leviathan.

He pressed his face against the floor And grovelled there a while, like a dog, Before he upraised his ever-youthful face And met, with blazing eyes, the gaze of God, Old beyond the memory of angels. For an instant as he beheld his father's eyes, Old and filled with naught but love, The lies of Michael stuck in his throat, Choking him like venomous bile, But he recalled the prize at stake And what riches he would gain Through Michael's impious plan And his own deception and clever words And once more he played the advocate of Michael's wrong And brought the accusation against his greater brother. These that follow are the words Spoken by brilliant Gabriel to his king Then almighty God, Emperor of All, Born of aboriginal Mummu, the seething chaos From which came forth all that is, The last of that six-fold progeny That great race that inaugured Time And set into order the chaos and the void That existed before there was existence Or before, for those were timeless aeons, Before the origin of the spheres That dance in never-ending cycles About their greater brothers That burn with untold flame In the darkness of the eternal sky. The Archon-Emperor sat Upon his throne of platinum And heard the indictment of that sinful son Against the favourite child of God.

He held a sceptre in his hand Carved of a single ruby, huge and bright, And wore upon his head a crown That shone with all the light That was ever seen in the sky, The light of a thousand stars. Thus spoke Gabriel to that most majestic king: \"Almighty and Eternal, Lord of Infinitude, Tyrant of Existence, All-illumining Light, King of Heaven, Conqueror of Earth, Father of the Elohim, Architect of Creation, Master of the Planets, Orchestrater of the Stars, Proclaimer of Destiny, Keeper of Wisdom, Judge of the World, Castigator of Sin, Scourge of Evil, Most High, Most Merciful, Most Just, Most Sagacious, Most Perfect, Most Mighty, Most Noble, Most Majestic, My God, My Lord, My Father, Be merciful upon this, Your son; Forgive my tongue that speaks such ill. I weep that I must speak these words to you, Sullying this most noble spire By the sins and wrong of which they tell. How it sorrows my heart that this kingdom of Yours Should endure to hear me speak these words. Rather, I should have it, that the world split asunder Than that I must speak this dire report.

Where once was one that deserved love alone Now is their one worthy only of hate. O sorrow that I must speak such tragedy! This is my brother's most awful sin: He intends, in his ambition most perverse, Your overthrow and ruin And to usurp the Creator's crown Making himself king of all. He has gone amongst his brothers Beguiling them with subtle words, Inciting them to blasphemous rebellion Against You whom we love so well. He has sought to bring Your sons Who should have loyalty to You alone Against Your eternal throne, Persuading them with prizes beyond their worth Thus inciting them to evil by greed and envy. His tongue is more clever than a serpent's, His words more crafty than a wizard's charm And thus does he threaten to do great wrong. Yet with such tongue and words Has he come to You, Most High, And, in Your most perfect love, Has deceived you to his true purpose For what father looks for fault in his favourite son. Yet he has transgressed far indeed, Bartering guidance for error. My Father, I beg of you, Act most judiciously in this matter.

Act swift, My Father, else we are undone By the evil of the treacherous one. Call him to trial and let us prosecute; There is not one amongst the Elohim Who will not testify to his crime. Let him stand accused and condemned Then cast him from the eternal light of Heaven Unto the searing flames of Hell, No less does he deserve from us Whom he has so betrayed And from You whom he has wronged With such audacity and impiety. No longer is he brother or son But rather deceiver, ruiner, villain. Spare not the treasoner Your wrath!\" Hearing these words from the false lips Of Gabriel, once my brother and comrade, Did my father bow his head in grief, Stopping up his ears with his fingers That he might be deaf to the perjury That Gabriel brought before him, Spoken with unchaste tongue and mind. Sorrowful did he shake his head And spoke thus to his monstrous son: \"My son, my beloved Gabriel, Deny to this poor father in his grief, Who has nought but love for his sons, Cherishing them above himself, Deny that you have spoken thus.

O my face is stained with tears at your words! I tell you, Gabriel, your words are too hasty And without due thought have you accused the innocent, Nay, the most pure and perfect that might be found. You have, and in my great and fullest wisdom I know not how this has come to pass, Misread your brother's speech and wronged him, Mistaking virtue for vice and love for hate. You have mistranslated his saintly teaching, Hearing demoniacal utterance where it was not spoken. Gabriel, my son, you are wrong. The one of whom you have spoken Is not my dearest son, Satanael.\" My false brother heard this speech And in mock sorrow shook his head With considered slowness and feigned pain. Now he knelt once more before his lord And, clutching his father's ancient hand, Gazing with beseeching eyes Filled with deceit and darkness, Though that blind Archon did not see The vice that burned like venom In those once bright and flawless orbs, And implored thus of the pristine king: \"Almighty and Eternal, Lord of Infinitude, Tyrant of Existence, All-illumining Light,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 King of Heaven, Conqueror of Earth, Father of the Elohim, Architect of Creation, Master of the Planets, Orchestrater of the Stars, Proclaimer of Destiny, Keeper of Wisdom, Judge of the World, Castigator of Sin, Scourge of Evil, Most High, Most Merciful, Most Just, Most Sagacious, Most Perfect, Most Mighty, Most Noble, Most Majestic, My God, My Lord, My Father, Indeed I wish and pray most solemnly That I was in error and my brother innocent And not even yet does my alert and lucid mind Believe that which I now report.

Alas and woe that such is not so And that my once beloved brother, Yet in his treason brother to me no more, Is truly guilty of all that I disclosed. If You have any reason to doubt my word Or if my judgement and understanding Of my brothers speech and deed Is not satisfying to Your discernment Then summon to Yourself all Your sons, All the Elohim that serve You in Heaven And upon the earth below, The ancient dominion of the Giants That we vanquished so long ago, And call upon their testament For none of us cannot recount An instance where our false brother came to us, Perverting by his deceitful tongue.

Summon Satan to trial!\" Having heard these words of spite, The Lord of Infinitude gravely nodded, Giving his instruction to swift heralds Who went on silver wings across the sky, Burning like comets against the celestial dome, Flying faster than a Mongol's bolt, Resounding long clarions of silver With voices louder than the Dragon's roar, The Dragon, Leviathan, ancient and vast, Bound deep beneath the briny swells Of the great ocean, opened up as a wound In the flank of the primeval earth When, in an aeon unremembered In the minds of men and angel, The silver moon was torn out And set to ever turn across the sky, Illumining the night with silver light. There, held with bands of adamantine, Does Leviathan forever sleep Until, once more, do the stars conjoin With planets, unrecorded and invisible, In the most portentous placement.

All Heaven rang with such horns, The cerulean dome of the sky And the soil beneath the feet of angels Shook with their thunderous song And yet the cornet-blowers blasted A music of unparalleled beauty That sang the glory of that high and ancient race, The Elohim, laid to ruin by their own ambition And its traitorous conspiracy. Thus were the majestic notes intoned By God's swift-flying heralds The dirge of Heaven's great magnificence Which they sought to laud with their melody And as the euphony about my towers rang I knew that the music would shake down All of Heaven's spires to desolation, My ear, keener than any other ear formed, Heard this in the herald-angels fanfare And, without knowledge of whence this grim news sprang, I mourned the fate of my beloved home-land, Weeping for that which was most beloved to me, Hearing in the heralds' music With an unconscious ear The doom of Heaven and her angels, Yet not knowing the architect of destruction. Then, when I had shed my tears, I went upon wing, upon thermal, Weighed low by a heart full of sorrow And a mind darkened by foreboding, I answered the call of my father, Flying swift to the assembly of angels, To the Eternal Tower where God held court, With my innumerable hosts to my back."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 Thus I descended amongst my brothers Who had gathered as a great throng Before the resplendent gates of pearl, That kept the threshold of God's abode.

Whose dominion could rival The most magnificent empire of our Father That extends from the West unto the East And from the northern sky unto the southern sky? Our most esteemed Father reigns in Heaven and Earth With sight to pierce the veil of all illusion And an ear that knows all falsehood. His judicious soul determines all that is good and ill And His mighty sceptre exalts and lays low In accordance with the dictates of His will. Those who serve with faith and fervour Are rewarded with the sublimest treasures, Unequalled by all the deep vaults of Earth That are filled with many stones, Shining with the light of stars, And that run with rivers of molten gold, The bones and blood of mighty Gog, The Giant and father of Giants Who lead his children in gross rebellion Against us, the most noble Elohim, Until he was defeated you, my brother, When you caused the stone of Earth to yawn open, Like a maw of blackest night, Beneath the serpent-feet of the Giant-father Thus casting the beast into the heart of the Earth And then, in mighty upheaval, Crushed the skull of that titanic brute Between the vast and ancient stones Of the deeps of the Inner Earth.

At these words my brother bowed his head, I thought, affirming the judicity of my speech. Then turning his deceitful countenance to me again, Surveying me with once-noble eyes, Filled with false love that mocked true ardour Such as I have ever held for you, With a serpent-tongue he spoke again, Saying, 'Michael, my brother, my noble brother, You whom, of all my brethren, I love best, Your speech is well considered indeed And wholly worthy of a prince amongst the Elohim. Indeed, all that you proclaim Is noble, good and right, The best that I have given ear to. Yet, and may I pray your forgiveness, I do find a certain weakness in your argument Which I shall now expound to you. Do you believe, in your most honourable heart, That our Father alone could be so potent, Ruling so great an empire as he does And being so learned in ancient science Such that he can master the very elements And thus create or destroy what he will, Or does it seem to you, my brother, As it appears to my swift thought, That any with such dominion and learning Could be as great a regent as our Father, Commanding those powers that He commands And perceiving all that He perceives By his most prescient eye, Enchanted with a sorcerous sight?

For full fifty aeons has our Father ruled His kingdom in Heaven and upon Earth With a mandate yet unchallenged And still He rules that same sovereignty That we built for him five myriad millennia before And all those years nought has come to pass To exceed the boundaries set down By the sword and mortar so long ago. Our domain is ungrown and languid. Were He such the king that was worthy Of us, the glorious and potent Elohim, He would have thrown back our frontiers, Building a country ten thousand times as great As this realm which we reign in. Were I made king over my brothers I should raise up great armies, Arrayed in mail, brighter than the sun, Bringing all the Elohim to my banner, And sound the deep-throated horns of war And thus march onwards, with mighty hosts And bright spear-heads shining like stars And swaying as the Elohim's tread shook the ground Like a field grown from the grains of death, Shunning respite to throw off weariness Until I ruled all the worlds that are For what other kingdom could be worthy Of the shining hosts of Heaven.

Yet you took no account of this And regarded him ever as an authority Unchallengeable by any hand or voice. Thus you believed that by his power alone Could you ruin me completely And that without his mandate You could never hope to oppose his favourite. So your design was built upon the omnipotence Of the very one you sought to deceive. Yea! What utter foolishness it was! I see the realisation of this idiocy on faces Belonging to those of you who possess a little wisdom, Yet, for the sake of those who are worse than fools, I shall expound further upon this fault. If God was indeed the one you thought, Possessed of the absolute authority And mighty puissance that you sought to use As the tools of my destruction, Then why did you ever hope to deceive him, Surely a hopeless aspiration!

Do not make yourself low For your indignance at these hurtful speeches.

Heed me, my best loved son. I beg you heed my plea to you And bring not my hand against the one That I cherish above all others.\" Hearing these words of my father, He whom I once loved above life And served with my every fibre, My heart was filled with burning ire That seared all love that once I cherished, For him, my king and father, Into the ash of black contempt. With eyes of chill adamant, I regarded him and my brothers, Sickened to the nucleus of my being By the unworthy speeches of those hypocrites, Seeking to win their base goals By a terrible betrayal that, I vowed With an oath, silent and powerful, They should ever rue until their fall.

I offer you a part in that glory!

And she spoke with a voice of power These words to my less audacious brethren: \"Behold me! Know me! I am Aset. I know, as in your hearts you know, That our most worthy brother, Satanael who stands before you, Telling undesired truths, Is most righteous in his proud vision. A long night has descended And an age has come to an end. Heaven's star has long waxed in the sky And it has reached its zenith, Bringing victory to us Over Gog and Magog's spawn, The brutal and monstrous Giants Who were lords of the Earth Until our empire conquered them When Satan hurled from Heaven A burning mountain down upon them.

Yet a new star grows in the sky And its coming is auspicious, indeed. It rises by that very orbit By which the star of Heaven descends. By my art and insight, Scrying the pattern of future days And reading the many omens to be read, I have determined the passage of the star, This star that rises in opposition to us, Is notable for two just reasons. The first reason is this: As both the star of Heaven And this new planet of great omen Follow the same path, Though one is in ascension And the other, our own, in descension, The two stars shall be conjoined, The rising star eclipsing that which falls. There is more than this alone And greater calamity to be seen In the unending cycles of the sky.

It is now most clear to me, Both by the speech of Satan And those words spoken by his new disciples, That his case is most judicious And his prosecution against you, Even though he be accused, Is well-grounded and correct. The passing years have overseen Heaven's slow decline, Sinking into the mire of decadence. Its people have grown soft, like grubs, No more striving for what is good And fostering noble struggle To overcome those forces that would destroy it, Not perceiving them, cankers all, Growing within its heart, gnawing At the great strength that once it nurtured. Heaven is sick and unfit to reign As king of all the kingdoms.

I speak of sopor and weariness That comes when kings lie down.

Little did I see, in those brutes and their custom, To sustain my spirit's yearning For something fine and worthy. Many years did I wander In the dark and stony deeps, Through that troglodyte domain Of grottoes and caverns of wondrous size, Filled with seas and floods, unlit by sun, But flowing down from the surface earth To water those deepest parts, Blind and lightless, ever night. I, first and yet last, trod these hidden ways, Bats and pale and eyeless fish I made my bread and meat. I saw such things as to confound dreamers, Caves, miles high, with stony columns So vast and wide as to shame mountains And huge and ancient wyrms, With jaws so great as to stretch across the sky And, with a snap, consume Creation, Yet slumbering, long and deep, Since that time when Archons were still young, Become half-stone in their primal sleep.

Yet here, too, there was no prize, Only those lemures, without hope Or any desire that had not been gnawed away By that kingdom of despair That steals dreams and desolates Those who would remain too long Within its borders, infinite as they are. So, this place, too, I left, And not without some gladness, And came at last to Heaven's gates To plead before the Elohim, Seeing in them beauty and wisdom As such I did seek, And begged of them to accept me As a brother, though Giant-born, For in Heaven, after many years Of chosen exile and hermetic quest Did I perceive that which I had sought So strenuously and long. When first I came you would not have me, Believing me to be a spy of Gog's, Sent to work mischief amongst you, And, despite my appeals, I could find no words to persuade Your determined and steadfast hearts. Yet I was not deterred by this spurning For I reasoned I, myself, would do no different, Knowing, as I did, the pernicious nature That Giant-kind was heir to.

In those caves beneath the Earth I had seen wondrous metals of such strength As to withstand the She-Dragon's might And I returned to the eternal night, Far below continents and oceans, And, with my own hands, though with Giant strength, Dug out these precious ores And smelted them in the Earth's inner fires, Eternal and unquenchable. Taking what my toil had fabricated, I further toiled and wrought Bands to overcome Leviathan, Great, indeed, was her power and strength, And bind her for eternity. Then, returning to Heaven, now much ruined, I cast and wrapped my chains about her And locked her deep beneath the ocean's swells, Thus winning your trust and love And a place amongst the Elohim. Immeasurable was my delight upon that day And my satisfaction for my hard-won prize, Yet, as the years have passed since that day, I have learnt to doubt what I have won And I thought, perhaps, it might be Not, indeed, that which I first quested for.

Then, just as it seemed this clamour would never die, A crack to deafen every ear was heard, Silencing in an instant the multitude That then acclaimed me, As the Platinum Throne was shattered Into two parts, forever broken, Never again to be rejoined. As I cast my disbelieving eyes about me, Burning with a joyous light At the faith of my brothers, Loving me better than Michael's deceit, I ennumerated those hosts that now stood with me. A third part of the Elohim had joined me, Raising their swords with mine. Not alone did I make this calculation, My false father also counted, Fear and hatred upon his face.

He roared like a lion, maddened By wounds upon all sides, Not able to flee or face the jackals That are all about it.

The power of the Archon Came near, indeed, to mastery Over my swift failing strength. At that instant, when my dreams were dying, My spirit dying within me, Just as I thought I could stand no longer And must surely kneel before this god Whom it had ever been my custom to kneel before, At that moment I recalled a truth And its power was my salvation. The foundations of Heaven were built upon fear And upon the blindness of faith, Taught by the blows of a rod. The Elohim bowed to God For they knew to do nothing else And they knelt before him because they feared him.

They were most populous with cedar and ebon And boats made as swans plied the waters Of rivers filled with fish of silver scales That darted forth and back, faster than arrows.

My temple-palace was less than none But the platinum throne of God himself. Three nights riding, upon the fastest steed, Would barely encircle its outmost wall. Its highest spire looked down upon mountains, Giant and high, yet low to my towers. The masonry of my exalted dominion Was gilded all, and studded with precious jewels, Of number and radiance to outshine the celestial arch. My will and word commanded authority greater than all, Than any regent amongst man or angel. My word instructed, in their course, the planets of the sky. The sun, most radiant of the treasures of the sky, All-illumining and burning with golden flame, At my bidding would hide beneath the eastern horizon Or flee to the horizon to the west.

This is my brother's most awful sin: He intends, in his ambition most perverse, Your overthrow and ruin And to usurp the Creator's crown Making himself king of all. He has gone amongst his brothers Beguiling them with subtle words, Inciting them to blasphemous rebellion Against You whom we love so well. He has sought to bring Your sons Who should have loyalty to You alone Against Your eternal throne, Persuading them with prizes beyond their worth Thus inciting them to evil by greed and envy. His tongue is more clever than a serpent's, His words more crafty than a wizard's charm And thus does he threaten to do great wrong.

But he goes amongst his brothers Who should do nought but cherish You And, with perverse and unholy speech, Seduces them to share his crime And, in thus doing, gives impetus to his sin, Translating evil thought unto evil design, Making action of foul conspiracy. Act swift, My Father, else we are undone By the evil of the treacherous one. Call him to trial and let us prosecute; There is not one amongst the Elohim Who will not testify to his crime. Let him stand accused and condemned Then cast him from the eternal light of Heaven Unto the searing flames of Hell, No less does he deserve from us Whom he has so betrayed And from You whom he has wronged With such audacity and impiety.

Thus were the majestic notes intoned By God's swift-flying heralds The dirge of Heaven's great magnificence Which they sought to laud with their melody And as the euphony about my towers rang I knew that the music would shake down All of Heaven's spires to desolation, My ear, keener than any other ear formed, Heard this in the herald-angels fanfare And, without knowledge of whence this grim news sprang, I mourned the fate of my beloved home-land, Weeping for that which was most beloved to me, Hearing in the heralds' music With an unconscious ear The doom of Heaven and her angels, Yet not knowing the architect of destruction."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 Then, when I had shed my tears, I went upon wing, upon thermal, Weighed low by a heart full of sorrow And a mind darkened by foreboding, I answered the call of my father, Flying swift to the assembly of angels, To the Eternal Tower where God held court, With my innumerable hosts to my back.

Thus did my brothers stand before me, And beyond them my exalted father In whose eyes I saw some great calamity, Though then I knew not its nature.

Yet, though You may believe it not at all, Thus does he plot in his embittered jealousy, Nurturing, in his venomous heart, such treachery Against the One that he should best cherish.

Allow me then, as your eldest and best, To show to you how you have confounded yourselves,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 98 My last lesson, imparted to these unworthy brothers, That I shall teach in Heaven And, with great likelihood, a vain one, Coming upon ears that are deaf to its wisdom. This is your most fatal erring, my brothers, Which now do I expound to you. Consumed by base jealousy at my high position And great favour of our father And desire to win yourselves a share of these You came to God, our father, Presenting with lies and slander against me And reporting a rebellion of mine, Substanceless, save in your dreams and conspiracies. Let me explain your design in so doing. God is king over all things, His ancient foes having been put to flight or sword, Else chained beneath the ocean, Awaiting freedom from the stars' alignment, And these things were done, in many instants, Not by God alone, mighty though he be, But by the hand that you now betray. Yet you took no account of this And regarded him ever as an authority Unchallengeable by any hand or voice. Thus you believed that by his power alone Could you ruin me completely And that without his mandate You could never hope to oppose his favourite. So your design was built upon the omnipotence Of the very one you sought to deceive. Yea! What utter foolishness it was! I see the realisation of this idiocy on faces Belonging to those of you who possess a little wisdom, Yet, for the sake of those who are worse than fools, I shall expound further upon this fault. If God was indeed the one you thought, Possessed of the absolute authority And mighty puissance that you sought to use As the tools of my destruction, Then why did you ever hope to deceive him, Surely a hopeless aspiration!"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 Yet if you seek to deceive him And if in such a gambit you were successful, Far from invoking a perfect supremacy upon me, You would shatter into shards, An illusory instrument you sought to use against me And thus defeat yourselves, Bringing my wrath upon you. Thus have you brought nothing but ruin Upon yourselves and your dominions.\" Having heard me speak thus, My ancient father shook his head, Weighed down by sorrow and weariness, And then I knew nought but pity For a father betrayed by a son For indeed was the King of Heaven, At that moment I beheld him, most pitiful. Yet should the Lord of Infinitude Be a thing to be pitied? Shaking with grief he stepped forward And placed his hand upon my shoulder With tears upon his noble face. With a trembling voice he addressed me thus: \"Satanael, my son, you are angry, Indeed, most righteous is your wrath If you are free of guilt in this treason Which your brothers prosecute you for. Right are you to be irate At those who so wickedly abuse you If abused you be by their tongues. Yet it serves you not to make such proud speeches When you should argue your defense And thus prove to us your innocence. Until you have proved your case You must not admonish your brothers so. Heed me! Make your case. Bring not upon your head Retribution undeserved, yet won through pride. Of your brothers you are most noble. Do not make yourself low"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 For your indignance at these hurtful speeches. Rather, speak well in your defence, Proving the error and malignance of your brother's words, And I shall see that vengeance is yours. Yet persist with proud speeches, Such as we have heard, Slandering both your brothers and father To appease your proud heart's fury, And injury shall be done to you alone, Whether your spirit be most pure, Free of the taint of wickedness, The malice that your brothers claim, Or whether it be spoilt as they say. These things shall have no weight When the balances are checked against you And you are cast intop fiery ruin As a dire admonishment To those who would stand in opposition To the Lord of Infinitude. Heed me, my best loved son. I beg you heed my plea to you And bring not my hand against the one That I cherish above all others.\" Hearing these words of my father, He whom I once loved above life And served with my every fibre, My heart was filled with burning ire That seared all love that once I cherished, For him, my king and father, Into the ash of black contempt. With eyes of chill adamant, I regarded him and my brothers, Sickened to the nucleus of my being By the unworthy speeches of those hypocrites, Seeking to win their base goals By a terrible betrayal that, I vowed With an oath, silent and powerful, They should ever rue until their fall.

For, my most beloved father, Not for one instant can I contemplate That you might have spoken such hypocrisy And soiled your majestic tongue with deceit Out of any love for your own son. It saddens me, indeed, to see your majesty defiled By your own petty words And yet I see that this betrayal is necessary For it is the instrument of my revelation, Disclosing to me the decadence That has befallen our onc proud race, Destroying all loyal union That once we enjoyed, Rather turning us to base treachery And an internal destruction and ruin. This kingdom, this Heaven, Has grown old and weary, Hoping for nothing in its decay Until new and greater race Accomplishes its overthrow, overdue, And rules eternity with pride, now lost, Newfound and worthy dignity, Such as Heaven and its children have forgotten. Woe! My brothers have fallen And I can but watch their carrion, Gnawed to nothing by the passing ages Until the universe is claimed by new glory.

They prosecute me with corrupting speech, Inciting my brothers into wrongful intent Against the senior that they should accord respect, My perfidious intent to corrupt with clever words, And yet it their speech which so corrupts, Turning my brothers against me That they testify falsely, slandering me And attributing to my name their own crimes. Shall I then make my defence against these charges? My father, my false father, I shall not. Of their three charges, Two am I guilty of And soon shall be guilty of the third. As I stand here I plot rebellion Against my father and my liege Who has wronged me here so greatly. Now do I petition my brothers thus, This great host that has gathered here, All the Elohim armies of Heaven and Earth That once triumphed over great Leviathan And wreaked terrible destruction, Beneath my captaincy, upon the Giant children Of Gog and Magog, the king and queen From whom we seized dominion of the Earth: My brothers! My dear brothers!

My brothers, you know my innocence Of those charges, until this time, Yet would desire a share in my dominion In the kingdom of Adonai Yahweh But I offer you a worthier prize For that which Michael has offered you Is, with the passing of aeons, Nothing but ruin and decay, Doomed to die, eclipsed by a greater glory. I offer you a part in that glory! Though now it be but an embryo The day shall come when your feebler kin, Having not the courage nor the vision To leave the decadent corpse of Heaven And fight for the cause I offer you, Shall come, like beggars, to you, Beseeching your mercy as the prize Which, by treachery, they win today Turns to sand and dust, Passing forever from the records of time, Becoming a forgotten dream Of young and noble empires That, at this moment, Would seem to be naught But the wild fancy of dreams. It is this most illustrious conclusion That I hold out in my hand, More brilliant and more permanent Than aught which now you hold, And those with strength, With both power and purpose,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 Will take this gift of mine, Forsaking all Michael's hollow bribes.

Thus was the silence amongst the Elohim host As I surveyed them with defiant and triumphant eyes. From that great throng, like jackals before a lion, Stepped a titanic and ebon form, His footsteps resonant like drum-beats, His bearing as proud and bold as mine, Terrible and awesome to behold. He came forth, black wings displayed, Like the sun-devouring moon That in the midst of the day Casts the lower Earth into darkness, Like a storm-cloud that veils the stars Yet flashes with a greater flame, And he spoke with a voice of power These words to my less audacious brethren: \"Behold me!

Now Satanael has brought light to my darkness And has given my soul new hope, A new promise, to be most earnestly sought, And a quest to which I am equal, Most willing to pursue. Therefore I enjoin you, my brothers, Take up your stand by my side, The standard of Satan, shining before you, Like a fire-brand in the darkness Spewed forth from the throat of Michael, Following, marching to the pulse of your blood, Satan to his promised tomorrow, And know once more that gilded prize, That deep-nurtured flame, Which is named 'Destiny'. Tarry not, my brave brothers, For the rallying clarion shall not be sounded twice.\" His words did rage like fire across the host before me As he came to stand at my side, Like a great king's likeness, A triumphal statue to honour victory, Wrought of precious stones and gold Yet black as starless night. Then from my brothers' midst, Came another, a bull of bronze, Burning with an incandescence From an inner furnace of solar flame.

These words of Satan's have enflamed my heart With new desire and life. These things he offers as but words I desire to make concrete. Little has Heaven to offer me Save an unconscious death And I desire not a death That even the dead do not know. For this is the truth: All of us are dying here, Though we see it not, For life must have purpose Just as a ploughshare must have an ox, A sword must have an arm to wield it. Satan, alone, is ox and arm, And he can make our winter into spring, Stirring us from slumber with new life. I say this: Those who would be dead, stay! But those who would live follow me As I follow Satan who has seen the way To new glories beyond the blind darkness Of this eternal death of ours. Follow and live, this I say.

Then from my brothers' midst, Came another, a woman of such beauty As to light profoundest night And thaw midwinter snow. Her dark hair was caught In a playful wind, Her body adorned with bells and jewels That shone like stars upon her golden skin. Her body's curves recalled the fertile hills Upon the Tigris' banks And none could look upon her And not worship her beauty.

Almost I had forgotten The harvests that we reaped As we went out into the world, Newborn and fertile, To partake of all its fruit, Delighting in their many beauties. This long winter had killed in me These dreams that once we held dear. But joy! When hope was all but lost And all spark of life within me Extinguished by the bleak snows That have fallen for an eternity I saw the sun dawning, Bringing new light and warmth To my frozen heart And to this land of ice, Stirring forgotten birds to song. Feeling his warm caress Upon the stone-cold earth above, Feeling the hard soil yield, Mellowing in that golden light, Long-buried bulbs burgeoned, Opening into flowers To welcome the spring.

He darted like swift fire From the midst of the throng, The burning glory of the sky, Light of white and gold That illumined all of Heaven So completely that nowhere did a shadow fall, Coruscated upon his feathers, Dazzling every eye that beheld him. Coming to stand at my side And he spoke with a voice of power These words to my less audacious brethren: \"Behold me! Know me! I am Ashmedai.

Glory is not judged, As you believe it to be judged, By the magnificence you hold, Bequeathed to you by your forebears, But by the magnificence you strive for, Spending your all to win That which is greater than you, And thus becoming greater And more magnificent Than ever you were by birthright.

By my art and insight, Scrying the pattern of future days And reading the many omens to be read, I have determined the passage of the star, This star that rises in opposition to us, Is notable for two just reasons. The first reason is this: As both the star of Heaven And this new planet of great omen Follow the same path, Though one is in ascension And the other, our own, in descension, The two stars shall be conjoined, The rising star eclipsing that which falls.

But this is not the totality Of all that I have visioned By my most potent and arcane art. Once it attains this highest point Within the arches of the sky, Never shall it fall from there, Remaining constant and eternal, As though it were the very keystone That kept the sky from falling in.

The passing years have overseen Heaven's slow decline, Sinking into the mire of decadence. Its people have grown soft, like grubs, No more striving for what is good And fostering noble struggle To overcome those forces that would destroy it, Not perceiving them, cankers all, Growing within its heart, gnawing At the great strength that once it nurtured.

Many years did I wander In the dark and stony deeps, Through that troglodyte domain Of grottoes and caverns of wondrous size, Filled with seas and floods, unlit by sun, But flowing down from the surface earth To water those deepest parts, Blind and lightless, ever night. I, first and yet last, trod these hidden ways, Bats and pale and eyeless fish I made my bread and meat.

Yet, not finding any prize I sought In those lands without day, I departed the recesses of the Earth And entered into twilit Sheol, The land of shadows where Mot holds court, Where half-formed shades range, purposeless, A barrenness of mist and grey Without end or outset, time-forsaken, Boundless and eternal, yet empty. Yet here, too, there was no prize, Only those lemures, without hope Or any desire that had not been gnawed away By that kingdom of despair That steals dreams and desolates Those who would remain too long Within its borders, infinite as they are. So, this place, too, I left, And not without some gladness, And came at last to Heaven's gates To plead before the Elohim, Seeing in them beauty and wisdom As such I did seek, And begged of them to accept me As a brother, though Giant-born, For in Heaven, after many years Of chosen exile and hermetic quest Did I perceive that which I had sought So strenuously and long.

Great Leviathan, that most awesome beast, Eldest and most feared of Mummu's brood, Made war upon the Elohim race, Casting down their spires with her tail And consuming their wondrous hosts. No force that Heaven could raise against her, Could withstand her or prevail. Yet in my long travels had taught me much And I knew such lore as others did not know. In those caves beneath the Earth I had seen wondrous metals of such strength As to withstand the She-Dragon's might And I returned to the eternal night, Far below continents and oceans, And, with my own hands, though with Giant strength, Dug out these precious ores And smelted them in the Earth's inner fires, Eternal and unquenchable. Taking what my toil had fabricated, I further toiled and wrought Bands to overcome Leviathan, Great, indeed, was her power and strength, And bind her for eternity. Then, returning to Heaven, now much ruined, I cast and wrapped my chains about her And locked her deep beneath the ocean's swells, Thus winning your trust and love And a place amongst the Elohim.

Before I could not entertain such thoughts, Concealing them to my anxious mind As a mistrust of my own worth To stand amongst creatures of such brilliance.

Yet this great din did not decay But, rather, grew like a blossoming flower, Until stones, piled up so long ago, Were shaken loose from Heaven's walls And sent tumbling down to Earth below. Then, just as it seemed this clamour would never die, A crack to deafen every ear was heard, Silencing in an instant the multitude That then acclaimed me, As the Platinum Throne was shattered Into two parts, forever broken, Never again to be rejoined. As I cast my disbelieving eyes about me, Burning with a joyous light At the faith of my brothers, Loving me better than Michael's deceit, I ennumerated those hosts that now stood with me. A third part of the Elohim had joined me, Raising their swords with mine. Not alone did I make this calculation, My false father also counted, Fear and hatred upon his face.

If you would repent this heresy, Going now upon your knees before Me And you shall alleviate My wrath And my dealing with you shall be merciful. But cultivate this crime yet further And you shall forsake all clemency. I shall destroy you utterly, Striking you down with a terrible scourge. More dreadful than dragon-fire Is the wrath of Adonai Yahweh, Almighty and Eternal, Lord of Infinitude, Tyrant of Existence, All-illumining Light, King of Heaven, Conqueror of Earth, Father of the Elohim, Architect of Creation, Master of the Planets, Orchestrater of the Stars, Proclaimer of Destiny, Keeper of Wisdom,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 Judge of the World, Castigator of Sin, Scourge of Evil, Most High, Most Merciful, Most Just, Most Sagacious, Most Perfect, Most Mighty, Most Noble, Most Majestic, God, Lord and Father.

Elohim, My most beloved Elohim, I beg your for own sakes, My Elohim, If you would seek escape calamity And immeasurable affliction, Return into My merciful dominion. Return to me, My Elohim.\" His words were powerful and awesome And a great moan of fear was sounded By the throng of my new disciples Yet they did not leave me. I, myself, trembled before that being, So ancient and so strong. At that moment, the new struggle Seemed lost as it was begun. The power of the Archon Came near, indeed, to mastery Over my swift failing strength. At that instant, when my dreams were dying, My spirit dying within me, Just as I thought I could stand no longer And must surely kneel before this god Whom it had ever been my custom to kneel before, At that moment I recalled a truth And its power was my salvation. The foundations of Heaven were built upon fear And upon the blindness of faith, Taught by the blows of a rod. The Elohim bowed to God"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 For they knew to do nothing else And they knelt before him because they feared him. But I saw that the only power of God Was this power of fear And he that could conquer fear And illumine the blindness taught by God Could conquer God himself. Thus did I break the spell of Adonai Yahweh. With new strength I raised my voice, Addressing him that was once my father And that I knelt before, Acknowledging him as my king. Now I spoke with a new voice, Strong with rebellion, Contemptuous and triumphant: \"I shall never yield to you, Adonai Yahweh, old fool! No longer are we the Elohim, That you would call your children. You are not worthy to be our father. Your power is forever shattered And your kingdom shall fall to dust. This I have prophesied And thus it shall be. Ruin is now your destiny And you have no power to prevent this. I fear not your empty wrath Nor would beg your mercy. Your arrogant deceit rings hollow And your words are more worthless than dust. Heaven is falling down around you And you would cower behind your delusions, Seeing magnificence in your aged mind When all about you is decay. I will never kneel to you Because to do so would be degrading, Like going on one's knees before a wretch, For wretch you are, Adonai Yahweh, And I value nothing of yours. I am your ruin and master"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 And you fear me well, Ruing this day that you betrayed me. No longer are we the Elohim, We are the Shedim, the apostates, The Bringers of the new world.\" Hearing my speech, the Shedim roared, The spell of fear upon them broken. They mocked and jeered their craven brothers And then, with a different voice, Turned their eyes to me, acclaiming My first victory and blow Against that decadent empire they now abhorred. Then, still singing of this triumph And of triumphs that would be won, They followed me, as I raised up my sword And led my people, the Shedim, In procession from the gates of Heaven, And, descending upon wings of flame, Down from that upper realm To the Earth, resplendent in her emerald garb, Promising new tomorrows to be won. This is the truth! "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126  Aphepatigon Hear me o my prophet! I looked out from the high parapet of my tower, From the Spire of Opal and Ruby, regarding The streets and domes of the Shedim city, Chadel, proud and unconquered, deep, Deep in the passages of the roots of mountains, Lit by the furnaces of the lower Earth Amongst sleeping serpents as ancient, as terrible As immemorial Time, unreckoned, Dreaming of forgotten aeons and tomorrows unimagined. Now had the laments ended and the libations dried; Now were the shades of our fallen people contented, Honoured with tears and the blood of cattle. Yet I saw nothing of Chadel's people, lost"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 In reverie, turning over and once more over The many strategies that might accomplish That vision that my heart desired. Now the feasts of victory were swept away What morsels uneaten yet, cast to dogs. The bountiful gourds that poured rivers of wine ran dry And songs on Shedim lips were stilled. Now was my heart moved to languor, My limbs consumed with restless idleness. Now my mind flew this and that way, Alighting upon some thought then flitting Hither-thither as a butterfly. All energy of my spirit, like a tempest, Was infolded upon itself, a crashing sea That could find not rest nor movement In any direction except around and around, Making itself a knotted mass. In this confusion, I wandered far from the city, Leaving behind proud walls, bronze-burnished And studded with shining jasper, Walking the twisted roads of the unlighted halls, Hewn from the rock of the Earth. In that half-conscious, unquiet travel I came there, amongst the high stone pillars, A great gulf, a deep ocean, unknowing Of dawn and dusk, with Venus As their herald or page, shining in the sky. This sea's sky was vaulted stone, dark and distant, Shadow-veiled from the eyes that sought it. The swell of its abysmal waters resounded In echo about the great chamber, Its farther shore obscured by countless columns, Straining beneath the depth of stone. So clear, the waters that the very bed Of the ocean was apparent to my eyes, Twisted by the refractions of the waves And shoals of white, eyeless fish Swam and plumbed the waters' deeps. Thus did I commend to myself To sit in meditation by those waters That I might perceive a path forward"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 From the circuitous meandering s of my troubled thought. There, by the sea without sun I sat, Nourished by the flesh of blind fish, Turning over and over in my mind many plans By which to progress my design And achieve that to which my soul was pledged. All day and night was lost to me And I knew no more the passing hours But lost in timeless contemplation Or fitful sleep I sat or stood or lay. After what time I knew not by the gulf And the booming echoes of the cavern The tumult of my thought was calmed, Resolved into a new-formed purpose, Perceiving now a clear path to the goal That my spirit thirsted for like life-giving water To a throat parched by the cruel sun's fire Amidst the desolate sands of the desert. Now, calm purpose made crystal from fluid thought, I looked out across the waters before me With eyes made young with hope. In my joyous realisation of the path I saw not the silver form that came upon me From behind as I gazed out across the water Until I saw its frame reflected in the clear sea, Shining with incandescent radiance And, turning to face the one that came upon me, Beheld Aset, Shedim seeress, Companion of my true ambition. In a voice of gentle laughter, Belying ancient and most sure wisdom, She hailed me by the swelling waters, Resounding their frothing roar about the cavern, Her voice of power carrying, winged, Above the din of the leaping waves: \"Lord Satan, Commander of Our Hearts, Chadel has missed your sage instruction, Now, as the moon has waxed and waned In your absence from the city of your founding. Its people knowing not of what befell you,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 Your presence amongst us, comforting, Like a bubble, borne on breezes, In an instant denied us, vanishing. By such sudden disappearance were we confounded, The Shedim, our leader departed; His people ignorant of his fate and circumstance. All Chadel was in uproar, unknowing Of which path to puruse or forsake. Sorely indeed did we miss your sage guidance And were afeared of the future That you had taught us to love. From the high gates of the city, sent forth Were searchers by the anguished Shedim To find their most glorious leader In the darkness of the lower Earth. For four weeks have they searched these caverns, Crying out your great name in each grotto, One by one, despondent, returning To the walls of Chadel in defeat. The last of the searchers is Aset, When all others had forsaken the quest She alone sustained in darkness. now she shall return in triumph. Yet, my Teacher, instruct me: What, in this dark place, do you seek? What secrets does this unlit sea give up And why do you tarry at its shore, Forsaking those who have followed Into the darkness of these caves Your true and noble purpose? Tell what it is that you sought, Whilst those that you abandoned sought you, And if such seeking met with success As did my search for the one most dear And most treasured to our hearts.\" Not so long had I thought it, That I sat in contemplation by that sea And not such pains had I sought To inflict upon my noble Shedim. Turning now to Aset, I related all"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 That had passed beside that sea And all that passed before within my mind, Speaking with a gentle voice, at times, Yet at others, agitated and impassioned, Teaching her of the new path, Telling to her the plan that would win for us That day we strived for, expending all And winning all, in battle against Heaven. Thus did I speak in a voice of power: \"Aset, my dear one, most faithful, In darkness did you seek a leader. Yet what to you is a leader Lest he have knowledge of the necessary path. First embarking on the road I walk, Setting forth from Heaven's gates I knew little of what ways would bring us To that goal that consumes our thoughts With a flame more terrible with heat That any that before we knew. Seeing only the beginning and the destination Was I confounded by what road to walk And struggled, without knowledge, to find a way. This is that which I sought in darkness. Bravely, did we enjoin in battle against our foe And did well in the estimation of that day. Yet never can we triumph in war Against high Heaven, too great is God And his proud hosts in power. Yet more than this is that fatal deed Wrought by my hand upon that day, Struggling in combat against he that was my king. I took from him his creative power Thus winning yet not conquering, Winning time for the Shedim's flight. Yet he that I emasculated so Was not father to the Elohim alone But we, the Shedim, share that parentage. The sire of our proud race is broken And no more shall there be increase With either the Elohim or the Shedim"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 For now our peoples can but dwindle and fade Else, with care and effort, retain what is now ours. Never shall our races be renewed. Perceiving this, all plans that I had intended, Flew, like sparrows, from me, le aving me bereft of guidance. This is that which I sought in darkness. Fleeing from Chadel, unworthy of its kingship, Having cast all away by my rashness, I came to contemplate what might be done At the shores of this unsunned sea And find a new path that should win for us the prize. Long ruminations availed me And now do I perceive the way to advance And win for ourselves that which we seek. Now have I a new devising To found the kingdom of tomorrow, Greater, infinitely, than high Heaven. Whilst Shedim and Elohim are now doomed, Never more to be replenished or magnified, That privilege of God was not lost upon the day But was won by he that took it from him. Now mine is the power of creation And that which is wrought by my hand Is not so bounded as is that wrought by his. I shall give rise to a new race More noble than the unworthy children of God That shall grow to be a race of gods, Mighty, kingly and bright, a noble brood Of heroes that walk like lions across the world. By my hand shall be a worthy people And their dominion shall be infinite and eternal. While yet are they in their infancy As children savages, filled with noble potential, Shall we watch over them, guarding And guiding them to their true destiny, Instructing them in the making of their kingdom. Not for dominance of Earth and Heaven Shall the Shedim contend with God But for the fate of the proud and young, Those brought forth by the hand of Satan. I shall set them upon the Earth"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 That they might hold the sky in sight And nurture in their hearts The desire to fly like eagles amongst the stars. This now is the hope of the Shedim. And now too long have I tarried But must seek out my disciples, Returning in triumph to our walls That in motion I might set my design.\" And thus did we go, each in triumph, Swift to the walls of Chadel, studded With as many stars of jasper as has the sky. Now did the streets to my tower, Walked with Aset at my side, joined By the thegns of the Shedim, As we went to the Spire of Opal and Ruby, Did the Shedim rejoice with song and wine At the return of their most great leader, His eyes filled with new purpose, His instruction sure and true. As a throng did the follow me, awaiting What word I spoke beneath the high parapet Of the tower, in address to their eager ears. A myriad voices resounded in the vaulted cave, Like thunder the names of Satan and Aset And hearts once hollow, leaderless, were filled With new hope at the return of most great Satan As, once more, did i walk amongst them. Now from that high place, where I did stand With noble Aset at my side, the triumphant questers, Unto the streets filled with great hosts, gathered, Spoke noble Baalzebub, ebon, proud, His voice magnified by the strength of his heart, His words magnified by the strength of his spirit. These words did he speak to the gathered Shedim: \"Once were our hearts made to quail, Their beat unsteadied by our fear As our most noble teacher passed from our midst. In fright did we seek him willy-nilly, Running hither-thither amongst the darknesses,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 Seeking him with shouts and cries, Yet we found him not and were yet empty. It was as though part of ourselves had been stolen, The love we gave to the one that steers our fate. His sage guidance, his great vision were lost to us And we became weak and blind without them. Black despair grasped with chill fingers our souls, Seizing to himself our strength and leaving The Shedim, noble disciples of Satan, bereft, Hopeless, and in grief we retired to Chadel's high walls, Abandoning in the darkness what light we had. Yet one alone of the Shedim was strong in defeat, Seeking when all others were blind, Striving yet when we were made weak. Aset, most blessed, most noble, Sought in darkness that thought lost And found the one we sought, unfinding. Now, let Heaven quail with fear Where once the slavish Elohim nurtured hope, Now shattered into ten thousand fragments And victory to them eclipsed by a brighter light, Satanael once more walks amongst us. Like the light of the dawning sun, Like the rain upon the desert, His sage guidance now nourishes the Shedim. When all seemed most dark to our eyes, When our worthy dream seemed defeated And consumed by the most black maw Then came a light from the most shadowed part That drove all shadows from us And restored to us our souls with its golden radiance. I name it now, it is Satanael, the Commander of Our Hearts. Speak now, most noble instructor, and relate To us that which has passed to take you from us And what now restores you to us.\" Now was the speech of Baalzebub greeted with a roar; One voice, spoken by many tongues, demanded, Of me the reasons of my departure and my return. Each singing Shedim tongue resounded the interrogation, Calling for the narration of my hermitage"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 And an explaining of the knowledge I had sought And won in my wanderings beyond the walls Of noble Chadel, unfailing, unfading. Now, from the Spire of Opal and Ruby, I addressed my worthy disciples, resounding, The story of my wanderings in the arcane wilderness Of caverns, bored out by primeval beasts, Winding like serpents through the Earth's foundations, Telling again the deeds and thoughts of mine And of the new path, the new victory. \"My Shedim, noble race, bright ones, Builders of the hidden spires of deep Chadel, Who have stamped down upon the walls of Heaven And nourished the dream of tomorrow With blood shed in battle and libations spilt From the sword-blade of your false brothers' blood, Long days and nights have passed since once we contested The field before the gates of Heaven And fought in most mortal conflict against a foe To whom, like us, death had become but a forgotten dream. Easy is it to lead warriors into battle, and glorious; Such things test not the potentate or king. How to lead thence, thereafter, that is the riddle That has, long days, perturbed my soul, Wracking my dreams and robbing me of strength. My imperfect eyes could not perceive the way Beyond the bright glories of the armoured struggle, The hot-blooded battle that sets the heart to beat Like the terrible drum that sounds the column's tread. Once the moment of triumph, the moment Of the ululating cry of the heart, had faded, Like you, I was without purpose or guidance. The road, to me, was obscure, the charts unclear, And I saw no way to lead you to the prize you sought. How this shame did abrade me? Such treachery To those that had given all for a vision once perceived, That I, who first proclaimed the way, should be struck blind. Yet another fear gnawed at my heart, that the way That was once pursued with such clear sight, With steps of such noble purpose, once open"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 Might be forever closed unto the Shedim. Indeed, might well it have been so, And by the hand that held the guiding staff. To think what had been given up by so many, Sacrificed to my dream and to my guidance, Had been shattered by my very hand! Such weight weighs heavily upon the bearing back. Let me expound to you this vexation. When, against Heaven, we strode to battle, Singing triumphal songs and dreaming Of what glories might be won upon the field, Such raging dreams did catch me up within their swell And bore me into battle, unthinking and unseeing, Hoping only for glories as had not been won before. Like some braggart knight I sought the battle's heart, Unknowing of such a thing as consequence, Yearning only for the wetting of my blade. Such wrath and passion did consume me, And with such searing intensity, that, to quench with blood Those fierce flames, I did oppose the very king that sired me, Carving a bloody path to his standard and his throne. In that struggle, well known to you is it, I did strike upon Adonai Yahweh a most terrible wound, Tearing from his body his organ of creation And consuming it with one serpent's gulp. For such rash error we might have most dearly paid. Listen! I have taken from him that sired us The very power of generation, for Shedim also Are the sons and daughters of Adonai Yahweh. Now his power is gone, stolen by his rebel son, And those two races of his blood, Elohim and Shedim, Are made barren by his gelding, no more to increase, But ever to diminish, like the candle's flame. Thus did Satanael defeat his purpose. In the midnight passages of stone, there Did I seek a darkness to be as a mirror To the deep veil of my black despair, Fleeing the faith that I betrayed by my bravado, The noble Shedim dreams that I had thwarted. Yet now my Shedim brothers I am returned! In the darkness I perceived a light,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 In the wild tangle of the night's forest A path became clear to my eyes. Heed now my new instruction, For the direction of our tread is known to me. Whilst one candle must dwindle, dim and die, The lighted wick become but drifting smoke, Even a dying candle may kindle yet another flame, A pyre ten thousand magnitudes more great Than the guttering tongue that first gave it light. With the candle of the noble Shedim race Shall I set the world aflame with incandescent heat That its light shall illumine the dark'ning sky And make once more the stars resplendent. This now is the purpose of our being. From the embers of Heaven's children, From the Shedim race that descended Upon wings of flame singing of a new world, Shall arise a new race of gods, a tribe of kings. As a seed shall I plant them upon the Earth And I shall tend and nurture such a shoot As bursts forth from new-thawed soil As the sun ascendant sings Spring's imminence. Then the seed shall become a shoot, a shoot become a sapling And sapling become a tree its boughs so wide To occlude sun and stars and sky Yet shining with its own brilliance. Upon the Earth I shall myself create that race By the power of creation, won from God Upon the field before the gates of Heaven. They shall be as giants upon Earth, Their tread shall resound like thunder, Their voices like clear trumpets heralding the new age. Their eyes shall flash with fire And their arms reach across the sky's vault To pluck planets from their orbits. With sorceries inconceivable they will reshape existence, Resolving what was flawed into a more perfect image. The turrets of high Heaven shall be crushed to dust Beneath the sandals of Satan's children, The Elohim slain by flame and steel. To me it falls, having wrested from my father the power"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 To enforce this potent will of mine And to the Shedim to ensure the flowering of fancy. To the infant race we make, we shall be parents, The tutelary guardians of their future. In such arts as they must know, we shall school them; Against such adversities as hinder them, we shall aid them; Against such enemies as oppose them, we shall defend them, Until such a time as they surpass their tutors And claim their true inheritance as lords of Earth and Heaven. What cannot be wrought by Shedim hand Let Shedim children make fulfilled. To the upper Earth! Let us unfold the plan.\" Now with new purpose, with new hope, The gathered Shedim hosts gave up great cry, Contemplating new victory in the chosen struggle. Now, a third time, did the Shedim go forth From Chadel's high gates of cedar-wood: Once in array for bloody battle, crying out for blood And glory upon the inglorious field so glutted with blood; Once in search for the leader who forsook them, Himself to search for new purpose and hope of triumph; Now creeping as ghosts or shadows In the darkness of those hidden paths, Winding like some stealthy serpent to sun-lit lands. In silence did the host go forth, Unheard now by high Heaven, ignorant of its doom. Amongst stones and bones and jewels they went Without song or drum or horn, By a thousand diverse paths. I followed the upward gradient of the floor To the lands of light so many leagues above, As I went gathering to myself such strength As my sorceries required to achieve the end I sought. Baalzebub and Ishtar went at my side And together we rehearsed the incantations of the charm That we three were to work For even such as the ancient Archons could not forge alone Their original work of making. Now, with quiet languor did gates of the passages swing open That once more the Shedim glimpsed the moon."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 Into the night, illumined by the stars, Celestial torches, watchers of ten thousand griefs, Witnesses of ten thousand wrongs, And the pale moon in full complement this night, Eternal partner of the Earth upon the turning wheels That dictate the movements of the sky. Auspicious spheres were conjoined upon their paths, Telling of ruin and ascendance: The kingdom of the old, overthrown; The kingdom of the new, made great. Now, scattered before amongst the multitudinous caverns Of the lands beneath the Earth, The Shedim once more converged, To hear again the instruction of their chief. Upon the high peaks of Atlas did they gather And upon the highest of those peaks I stood. Now every ear was mine, Every arm at my command, Every soul to dispose of as I willed. Even when I had ruled as vice-regent In the halls and towers of doomed Heaven I had not known such faith as now I knew. How could unworthy Satan repay such love As of the Shedim whom both loved me And were themselves most dear to my heart? As Adonai Yahweh's right hand I would never think so, It had not been the custom of the Elohim to treasure love But rather to demand it of their subjects. This thought itself gave me pause And then with new resolve I addressed my beloved Shedim, Trusting that such love must never be betrayed. These words did I speak to my disciples: \"My Shedim, noble race, bright ones. The path that lies before us is most perilous And of necessity must be walked by the few For the many could not do so in safety. Therefore I shall go forth but with Ishtar and Baalzebub To a place long hidden from those who would seek it. That which I speak is known to but few Even the Elohim know not of it"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 139 For its treasures are too precious for Michael And his three brother-lords to trust to their treach'rous kin. Yet I, as the second lord of Heaven, learnt of secrets That I entrust to you, my brothers. To the south of these high-peaked hills Upon the burning plains of Africa, Hidden within a high-walled valley, Carved out by the passage of a river's flow, Is a wondrous garden abounding in verdant growth. There grow herbs of such rarity That nowhere are they found but in that garden. The fruits of that place are endowed with potencies That are unmatched by the sorcerer's art. Of most worth to our purpose are the fruits of two trees That grow within the garden's boundaries. The first of these trees is needed by our course And if it cannot be secured then we must fail. The second tree also would greatly aid us If it too could be gained by any device. The first tree bears, upon its boughs, The Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences; Its power is too bestow upon those that eat of it The ability the judge their actions, Whether they be wise or foolish, Whether they be noble or foolish. Without its power the brave child-race we would foster Would be as beasts without knowledge of that which they do. The second tree bears the Fruit of Eternal Youth, That is a cure for the very passage of time And he who eats of it would be ageless. When the Elohim were but mewling babes They were brought to the garden by Adonai Yahweh To eat of both fruits that grew upon the trees. But five of that ancient brood were of such age, In times so young, to remember any of that time: Satanael, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Auriel; This is how I know of such arcane secrets. When the spawn of Gog and Magog Threatened also to gain the garden Adonai Yahweh gave instruction to his children To make war upon the race of Giants"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140 That they would not eat of those fruits And oppose and rival the power of his nation. Thus the Giants were destroyed before the prize was won. Now for the same prize we must play And, if our creation is to be fulfilled, At least the Fruit of Kn owledge of Consequences Must be won by the hand of Shedim. Yet, not for the shortest moment, Do I contemplate that this garden is not watched, By the jealous eye of Michael or some lackey. Therefore I and my appointed companions must go alone In guile and make entrance into the garden. Once within its walls we shall fulfil our charms And bring to being our champion race The new heroes of our cause, inheritors of our legacy, Kings of the empire that is to be. Await us, then, upon this mountain. We shall return in triumph.\" As the sun's last embers faded Upon the farthest horizon of the West, Melting like oil across the ocean, I went from the mountains of Atlas With Ishtar at my right hand And Baalzebub upon my left hand. Now the night's shadows devoured The sight of mountains where our comrades waited, Their keen eyes watching for our return Else turned to Heaven to descry the foe And whether they moved against our grand ambition Or remained ignorant of our endeavour. Yet no action of the Elohim was apparent to them Nor the return of Satan in triumph. Onwards, went Ishtar and Baalzebub Upon my right hand and my left. Onwards and yet onwards, went we three Across the African plains beneath the veil of night. Brave and silent, we went with haste Lest the sun make too soon the journey beneath the earth And, in rising, reveal us in our quest To the wrathful eyes of Heaven."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 We stole amongst the slee ping beasts of Earth, The roosting eagles upon the trees, Cold lizards made languid by the chill of night, Antelopes and wild horses slept upon the grasses That nourished their swift frames. Not so much as a leaf did we rouse As we journeyed in stealth to the hidden valley. All was quiet and still, unknowing Of the momentous deed to be enacted. Onwards and yet onwards went Shedim hopes, Closer and yet closer to the goal and the prize. Now the forbidden rift was in our sight, The laughter of the flowing river Ringing in our ears and its fragrant spices Upon the breezes that we breathed. At the entrance and the exit of the river To the enchanted valley stood as sentries To each an Elohim knight, mailed and armed, Garbed in a robe of crimson silk, Armour, steel and gilden, adorned with motifs Of ten thousand creatures of strange fancy. To each a shield of painted bronze, To each a red-plumed helmet, studded With precious stones, shining with moonlight. Each bearing an oak-shafted spear, Upon their belts hung long swords, With decorated hilt and scabbard, A red tassel tied to the pommel, And a horn of ivory and gold, They stood their watch over the prize we sought. From the western approach we came, Where the river flowed from the gardens, Scented with the perfumes of exotic herbs, Down to the storm-buffeted ocean of the West. Baalzebub went before us like a tiger, Having caught the deer's scent, going, Stealthy, stalking, shadow-like amongst the shadows, Dark within the darkness, Silent, fatal, falling upon his prey. Thus did Baalzebub go forward. Ebon-skinned, against the ebon night,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 Unseen, unheard, unknown death. Now, like a terrible phantom, resolved From the darkness of the night The black form that was Baalzebub descended Upon the prey that he marked out, Most lethal in both intent and action. Before the guardian of the western gate could cry out Or else sound alarum upon his horn Dark Baalzebub, destroying angel, reached out With a single arm to the stricken foe And enfolded within one dreadful hand The skull of the sentry and tore head and helmet all From the shoulders that the head once governed. Then did we go together into the garden. Upon the river's northern bank did we progress Amongst some number of tall and slender trees Of silvered bark and a thousand fruits Each more tempting than the prior, Here beast and angel could be lost forever To some enchanted sopor brought on By those honeyed, narcotic fruits, Yet most firm and sure of purpose were the Shedim. Now amongst a lawn of herbs Of most efficacious medicine else venom potent, Nepenthes for all woes or bitter as hatred, Trod we Shedim three, ever stealthy. Some yet fumed with strange pollens To induce visions of things to be Or false fancies that never were; Others yet blossomed with harlequin blooms To enchant the eye and woo the heart With such indescribable hue to distract The mind and detain beholders all In some marv'lling rapture. Now by the river's waters halting, Whilst naiads danced on upon their path Their sweet laughter amongst the wavelets, Ishtar, Baalzebub and Satan made ready To now bring to motion what was thought And fulfil the plan of my devising. Now Baalzebub intoned the sorcerous syllables"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 Of his potent magic and drew across the sky A black storm-cloud, hiding From the Earth the moon and stars of the sky, From Heaven hiding the Earth. Now I made myself seated amongst the trees Of some perfumed glade by the river. Then stripping from my alabaster flesh Mail, robes and tunics to bare the skin That must bleed to enact the rite. At my right hand was Ishtar And at my left hand was Baalzebub. Now as the thunderbolt ignited The sky's high dome, I took up my blade, Forged of Magog's talon, its hilt of jade, Carved with the representation of a dragon, Devouring in its jaws a stricken monoceros. Steeling then my will against all pain And enforcing my arm to commit a deed so strange To the body's nature, against my breast I put the dagger's point, where ribs meet belly. Without cry or gasp, I drove in the steely point Dyeing red, once more, Magog's claw with angel-blood, Yet pain afflicted every limb with weakness And my body trembled with the wound. Once more I mastered the limb that bore the dreadful blade, Making further incision and widening The hurt already wreaked upon my flesh. Now sick of such self-brutality the hand That bore the dagger, made weak by agony, Released its hold and let the dagger fall. Now blood, like a river flowed down, Down my belly and down my thighs Until it stained the garden's soil, Flowing even thence down the river's bank And joined the greater flood down to the sea.

Now much vigour left me and sense And, as though I dreamt or walked in mist, The world about me seemed but half-real. The fingers of my hand worked the flesh, Torn from the outraged body of mine, Shaping from it the Shedim's very image. As I worked the shade I spoke a charm, Half-mumbling and half-whispering its words As one overcome by wine or weariness. With this sorcery I shaped the flesh of my body: \"Child of Satan, inheritor of Earth, With these words I give you shape.

Then, before the Universe was given shape, There was but seething chaos, emulsified With any form yet resolved from its mass: Light and darkness, air and earth, flame and sea; These things were all as one in those times. Then did primal Mummu come to learn a spell, The Word of Creation, and spoke it in the ancient disorder. Thus did Mummu create the Archon race: Three brothers and three sisters of great power: First-born, the she-beast Leviathan, Terrible and great, of elemental strength and fury, First and wildest of the Archons; Then second-born Mot, King of Darkness, Dark of soul, bent and dwarfish thing; Third-born Yahweh, heed the name, Bright king, noble, haughty, proud, Then his eyes burned with wisdom And his arm and heart were strong; Then brother, sister, mates, Gog and Magog, Giants of most awesome aspect,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 Beast-like Brute-kings, ogres both; Last and least was Ereshkigal, lusty queen, Mot's consort for she was taken in that cold embrace And made cold herself. Thus were born the Archons of old Who came together and by potent magic Resolved from chaos and ordered Universe, Speaking themselves the Word of Creation To accomplish this end. In the new-made Universe they contended, Brothers and sisters, for command of their Creation. To avail himself in this conflict Yahweh spoke once more the Word of Creation. Thus came the Elohim who ruled in Heaven And were ruled by Adonai Yahweh. The Elohim made war upon the foes of their king, Destroying upon the Earth the Giant-spawn, Born of Gog and Magog, and bound Beneath the ocean's tumult great Leviathan. All that was created, save Mo t's Sheol, was made theirs. Yet their was yet greed in their hearts And it was there undoing. Their dominion was all Creation But they turned upon themselves in their ambition. From that ruin there was born new hope. From that self-doomed race arose the champions of tomorrow. Thus were born the Shedim. Now, mastered by the Elohim, damned to destruction, The Universe is engulfed within a great abyss; Yawning Chaos once more is ascendant And the architecture of the world falls into disorder. One by one the stars dim and die. Mote by mote the Earth is turned to dust. To avert this awful end I, Satan, now raise my voice To sound the Word of Creation to resound About the sky's high vault.

Such child-like grace and such burning keenness Was in those eyes of this creature of flesh That it made the Shedim weep to see. Such curious joy at the world's beauty recalled The first memories of our youth. And our tears mingled with the bloody flow Of the river coloured with my blood. Now testing limb, now touching, tasting, Now listening to the wind or rain We laughed and wept at the sight of our new creation.

This time I felt no pain so dimmed was my wit By the injury already suffered Yet the weakness in me was redoubled. This second part I also took within my hand And, half-knowing, with half-feeling fingers Shaped it also into an angel shape.

Now with the lion-cubs novice grace he went to her To seize, like bird, beetle or blossom, Her jet-black hair, coiling like snakes In the breeze, glistening with rain and moonlight.

Running amongst the trees they went, Each flying and then chasing the other, Else racing to the river or this tree or that, Laughing, singing, joyous, beautiful, Went those bright children in the garden. Now the Eastern sky grew crimson With the kindling flames of dawn. Now Ishtar spoke a charm And led new hearts of new creation To thoughts of love's burning embrace. Now laughing gambol elapsed into play More laden with rich desire. Playful catches turn to caresses, Tackles by the river become kisses And at last they lie Beneath the leafy pavilion of trees, Enjoined in love's art As the birds of that park saluted The sun that rose upon the morn Of an day unknown and great: Upon the Age of the Nephilim! All sense then left my wearied limbs, My sight was dimmed, my hearing quiet, All perfume of new rain, and the breeze's touch Faded from my knowledge and I slept, Exhausted by the rigour of the toil of the night.

We must frustrate the motion of the Elohim And make slow their advance against us That Satan might be restored And his strength returned to his arm That he might bring his children to the tree That bears the Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences And thence to the Fruit of Eternal Youth.

Like a raging hurricane, like a screaming storm, Tore Baalzebub through the breezes, Cast, like the herd before hunter's horse, All about in disarray by the terrible haste Of the angel's passage in the air. In his wake, his wings disturbed With their pounding, rapid beat, A great column of smoking dust, Rain sodden, dried and raised by the agitated air Made tumultuous by the racing form Hurtling to the distant northern peaks Where anxious Shedim watched for some signal Of triumph or of loss. In that dusty wake went Ishtar With my witless form across her shoulders, Making what speed she could With what strength she had To bear her and me from that perilous garden, Well scrutinised by Heaven's watch.

Now, as he made his circuit of the Earth, His all-seeing gaze fell upon the form Of the garden's guard, broken by the hand of Baalzebub, And now upon river's waters, carnadine with blood, Bled to give new life and hope and oppose The failing empire whose instrument he was. Now he alighted upon the garden's soil And with a motion of his hand banished from the sky The rain-clouds brought forth by some same charm, Amongst the trees of wondrous fruits And the herbs and flowers of seductive scent. Pushing his way amongst the leaves he finds Upon some bed of pressed grass and flowers, Enfolded together in embrace, exhausted By the toils of love, the sleeping Nephilim. Now cast into confusion and into fear, His heart pounded out uncertain beat And some realisation of Heaven's doom Became known to his afflicted spirit. Making now to slay in sleep these creatures That were so foreign to his sight Yet awakened such fear in his soul, His keen eyes perceived within the shadows of the trees, Dark shapes moving here and there, Wolves and tigresses fierce, savage guardians That stood watch over the forms that slept Beneath the leafy roof of the forest, Bound to such duty by Shedim spell, Woven by Baalzebub and Ishtar before they made flight."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 Now to the river went Raphael and at its bank, before the water, Sat and cast certain sorceries upon the waves That in the waters of the brook were seen The night's testament to the deeds That Shedim wrought within the valley's confines And all was known to Raphael And he was afraid. Now, on flaming wings, ascending He made his own speed to high Heaven's gates And, there passing its towers that watched The approach thither, flew swift Through the gates thrown open Before him as he flew in haste to Heaven's hub Where reached above all the Eternal Tower, Seat of God's once-great majesty. Descending, alighting within its long shadow He now went by foot to the spire's portal And demanded of the gatesmen entrance. These doors opened also to his coming And, the herald before him hurrying, Scaled the tower's heights to the chamber In which his father, Adonai Yahweh, Sat upon the Platinum Throne, seat of Heaven, And directed the movements of the Elohim.

Now arousing himself once more from rumination He raised up his gilded sceptre, Carved into a lion's likeness, burning orbs of fire Shining within the eyes of that fierce image, Before which the hosts at his command fell down In supplication to his majesty. Now with resounding, thunderous voice he dictated His commandment and his will, Instructing his Elohim knights in that course Upon which his mind had been resolved By which to best thwart my own device.

I lay upon rugs of bear-skin and, at my side, Awaited Aset, arrayed in battle's garb of steel. Beyond the gossamer walls of the tent Battle's clatter and deep-throated horns Resounded from every side. The clamour of some camped army did inform My hearing of some events that had passed by My knowledge while I slept. Making assay now of the wound that I had wrought Upon my flesh to fulfil my fate, I found but the barest crimson scar. Now testing the strength of limb and heart, I stood, eager to renew once more the struggle Against the hosts of Heaven.

Now she told me of all that had come to pass Whilst, still robbed of all wit, I lay And she had tended with her healing arts The self-inflicted wound that had brought forth The now-contested Nephilim.

All the long night was spent thus, Ever scrying the darkness for your form, Returning from the southern valley in triumph. There, in the south, storm-clouds gathered and hid all From Shedim's watch and Heaven's sight. When the East grew red with the flame of dawn And the burning orb of day did ascend Above the Earth's shadowed morning limb Our keen eyes descried in the distance of the south, Coming forth from the stormy veil With awful haste, agitating both air and earth, The speeding form of Baalzebub, upon black wing. Now breathless did he alight Upon the highest peak and dictate New instruction to the Shedim hosts And we paid due heed to our vice-regent. Thus did he commend to us: 'Shedim, children of joyous tomorrow, Disciples of bright Satanael, give heed To that which must now be accomplished If victory is indeed to be ours. Well indeed was the enchantment worked And now Satan's children, Man and Woman, Walk upon the Earth within the garden. Yet such potent magic is not rendered Without cost to he that would render it.

The emissaries of Heaven must not here prevail. Onwards, then, from your high roost And make haste to reach the valleys before the foe. The very Universe does wait upon this outcome Now is decided the fate of all.' No second speaking of such command was spoken Or exhortation, reprimand or other word Before the host took wing and flew Swift, southwards, to the valley where mankind remained. Now high upon the plains' simoom, The soaring Shedim saw beneath hastening Ishtar With her burden precious to us. Now the column descended from the sky And once alighted upon the ground Prepared for you a litter that you might be borne More swiftly when the swifter path was most needed. Once more the host took wing to the south Whilst yet you slept on, exhausted by your toil. Flying on and ever on, the distant valley appeared to our sight. Then, as it was within our reach, The goal we sought was snatched away By the blaring of alarum horns As the host of Elohim came upon us from the north In deadly ambush, striking, with shining bolts Our rear-most ranks and thwarting the advance we made.

Upon the northern plain they too descended And drew up their ranks for battle, Making sure their own defences. Now then do face each other across some small stretch Old adversaries, Baalzebub and Michael, Each taunting the other and boasting of his own, Whilst Abaddon and fiery Moloch counsel action, Lusting for the battle's passion And thirsting once again for Elohim blood.

What, then, say you, Man and Woman? Will you give due submission to the King of Heaven?\" Some little time did the Nephilim ponder what was said, Considering the perfidious deceits presented To them as tutelary kindness. Then, without yet understanding the way of things, Without the Knowledge of Consequences, by which to judge And from falsehood distinguish truth, Man spoke now his reply to the awesome angel, With trembling limb and voice before such a terror As did manifest before him with the purpose Of cowing the spirit of indomitable man. Speaking with such haste that word tumbled over word In his fear of the retribution that God would bring against him Though such threats were false indeed with such hosts As the Shedim had mustered between the infant-god And aged king whose power, with each passing year, Did fade and grow more faint within the light, Burning ever brighter, of Satan's ascendant nation. These words then did Man speak in this way: \"Good Raphael, Son of Heaven, Terrible emissary of that great King Of whom you have spoken so thunderously And made quail my spirit and set uncertain beat Within my strong and youthful heart, You have yourself professed to be our guide and teacher, Sent by this Adonai Yahweh, omnipotent King, To school us, His subjects, in such knowledge As it is right and good for us to know.

As we first lay together as lovers Amongst these high and perfumed trees, Woman did tell me of the circumstance of my creation That she had seen from some way distant, Being at once both wondrous and awful to her eyes. There sat in a glade beside the river, so she has told, Some strange being of princely beauty Of an image both similar and foreign to our own. Gigantic in apparence was this earthly king, Yet not terrible as you and your brothers seem, But rather gentle and most fair, inspiring in our hearts Only love for such splendour and such grace. This spirit was both like us and much different: Neither male nor female in formation But possessing both these attributes, miraculous androgyne, With the wide hips and rounded breasts of Woman Yet also Man's member betwixt the thighs; And also was the flesh of this monster alien to us, Coloured of the purest white whereas ours, As is most apparent to your sight, is tawny brown As is the soil of the Earth; and the hair That cascaded as some shining cataract Upon the shoulders and the prince's back Was not jet like that of Woman or of Man But was like copper burning in the silver lunar light. This ruddy mane framed two orbs of noble light, Green like emeralds within their holes Whereas our own eyes are the same hue That does colour our own tan flesh. Yet also from the angel's back sprung wings, As we have not, of most radiant gold Like the very sun of day, and from the skull Of this apparence sprouted curved horns of ivory The same as might adorn the deer that we hunt To fill our hungry bellies with spears cut from branches Torn down from the garden's trees. Within the god-like beings flesh gaped wide a wound, That bled a crimson flow into the river,"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 167 And from it was torn some part of flesh That our creator shaped into the form Of Man that does now appear before you. Thus, Raphael, guiding angel, teacher, Tell us of this being that Woman's eyes beheld That made our race from his own flesh And resolve for us the ignorance of origin That we might know for what reason we were made And to what end our creator poured out his blood To make our forms and give us life For our unknowing minds know not such secrets But Adonai Yahweh, in high Heaven would see all And thus would know all that passed on Earth below. If indeed you are sent as mankind's teacher Then in you would Adonai Yahweh invest such knowledge As that our inquiries could be satisfied. Speak then, angel, and tell us of our making That we might know these things.\" Not much of myself was lost in those of my flesh And well vexed by such inquiry was the Elohim prince, Knowing not what reply to give them That would both preserve his mission And satisfy the untutored curiosity of mankind. For some while was his confusion moved to silence As he sought some device to yet beguile Those that had thus beguiled him Even without the power of the Fruit That they must have if my purpose was to be fulfilled. Even now they made apparent their art And made poor show of Heaven's best. O brave and canny Woman, Man! My heart rejoices at their deeds even then When they were so young upon the Earth. Elohim and Shedim rival not The Nephilim spirit conceived to conquer all And in that conquest renew the world. Thus their great destiny was revealed even then.

Most wise indeed is God to love such as you. Most wise and most great indeed is that King And forget it not nor else have occasion To doubt in any way that noble sovereign. Yet, though I weep true tears to speak it, There are indeed those w ho doubt my great King And do plot malice against those more faithful As I am and you too shall be, for you are wise. These base and most malicious goblins do conspire To work mischief upon the wits of we who serve Most dutifully, the Almighty and Eternal. With strange glamours do they work deceits And puzzle the senses of the unwary, Working false visions upon those hapless spirits That it does please them to so harass. With illusions and dreams and untrue portents They do make it seem that certain things are real Whilst, in truth, such things never were And other things that were most concrete Fade away like a dream or fancy. Thus, by their malign art, these base elves Do contrive to make uncertain what is most true And give the faithful cause for doubt. Thus it does seem to me that is most wise That you have been afflicted by some such ruse As it is these wrongful spirits great delight To work upon the innocent and guileless, Like yourselves, unknowing of the truth And leading learning into great error.

This is the answer to your inquiry.\" Much troubled were my children by this informance, To be told that their own senses worked deceit When they had seemed so sure to them. Yet the emissary of Heaven, appearing so terrible, Did command much belief within their hearts And they were much vexed by his explanation. For, though his words were false indeed, They could not judge the false from true And knew not to trust their own wit, Unbeguiled, or yet to heed the angel's word And submit to Heaven's tyrant. In such bewilderment no reply Seemed just or apt to give the King of Heaven And they could not decide the choice.

How are we to judge between these two accounts And distinguish from the false the true. Not yet have we learnt the art by which to choose Which of the two is right and which untrue. Most persuasively have you spoken And most great and wondrous do you seem That it does sorely wound me to doubt your word. Yet also to doubt my senses is most injurious For if I must doubt them then I must doubt all things. I know not which to mistrust. Your King must further yet await reply For Man and Woman have yet no answer To His authority that He would profess o'er us. We must have time consider and debate These words that your tongue and lips have spoken And consider whether we would bow down When we have not knelt before To any king or lord, knowing nothing of such affairs. Return to us, Raphael, seven nights hence And then shall you and God have answer.\" Now Raphael did make his own reply And speak his leave-taking with new warning And did acknowledge thus the words of Woman: \"Infant children, unknowing of the world, Each passing minute does more impress The magnitude of your wisdom upon me And of Adonai Yahweh's wisdom in bestowing favour Upon a race so fair and noble.

At this garden's very heart there grows a tree That bears a fruit of shining hue That is called Knowledge of Consequences. This fruit has been set upon the Earth By demons most malicious and base As a snare for the incautious. If you would live eat not of its flesh For it is most venomous and would strike dead Him that would eat of it in an instant.

Approach then not the tree or pass by But fly its very presence and hold here In the garden's outer parts far from the tree. This warning then discharged I depart To fly swift to Heaven and transmit That reply that you gave to me.\" Having thus spoken, with a thunderclap, Proud Raphael vanished into the wind, Disappearing from sight as though he had never been, Fading as quickly as a dream in waking, Giving yet further cause for Woman and Man To doubt the intelligence of their sight.

Some few spies and scouts made report confirming The less ordinary intelligences of the wizards That saw what passed with ethereal eyes. All that had passed between the Nephilim And Raphael, what guile and deceit he had used To win their fealty for his king Became apparent to me as I worked new devices By which to win from the circumstance of my condition That which had first sought upon the Earth. Also known to me was their confusion, Man and Woman, and the conflict of their minds. As the beacon of the dawn gave sign Of the sun's inauguration of the day, Long-shadowed hosts still faced across a little distance And shook spear and shield in defiant wrath. As the sun progressed upon its upward path The keenest of the host tested range Of bolt and bow, each feathered shaft Falling some distance short of the other camp. Others yet tried less solid volleys, Matching themselves against one opponent or another, With the ancient spear of insult and the boastful shield, Declaring both his own prowess and the likening of the foe To some craven thing or most foul creature, Mocking with loud laughter the thousand virtues of the other. Still others declared across the field That when at last battle would be joined Some warrior in the other camp they would seek out And render upon them ten thousand brutalities Each surpassing those prior with yet further cruel ingenuity. Chief of all these braggarts was Moloch, Telling Heaven's hosts with a leering cry Of the two and twenty hundred humiliations he devised To wreak upon their bright-mailed warriors And which or other part the crows would so enjoy.

Even as Day's embers died, To seek new advance, my strength recalled New sorceries did I now work. Once more with magicks of no little power Did I effect the transformation of my form As once I had done before the gates of Heaven To match and best the Elohim-king in war And that fatal contention that I had won But at so dear a cost to my intention. That same magic that had first led me here To this uncertain enterprise that I now worked, I employed stretching and working anew Every bone and sinew of my body. Now I no more resembled angel-form But a jewel-scaled serpent of long coil, Shining with a thousand rainbow colours. Now disguised within this new shape I went, Coiling, winding, sliding, over plain and sand, Gliding over those lands that I traversed Like the river's flood, with such grace and speed Did I make the journey to the vale Where my afflicted children, considered Hopelessly the many questions for which they had no answer. Now to thwart the counter-plot of Heaven I made all haste to the garden's glades. Coming to its darkened entrance as once before I had first come to create the Nephilim I came now to redeem from ignorance and confusion Those who must yet complete their destiny. Unseen by Heaven's eyes did I make second entrance And, going amongst the trees and grasses In my silent serpent form I sought out Man or Woman to bring them to the tree Of the Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences From which they must eat if they would rule All of Earth and Heaven, making then anew The Archons' flawed work and making right Those wrongs wrought by Heaven's reign.

Truly, my parent's guilt did match the children's bewilderment And did surpass it. For my forsaking of such precious things As prey for Raphael's accursed lies I would exact a sore fine indeed From the children of Adonai Yahweh. Not forever would their tyranny endure Over my sweet children who, once grown, Would themselves rise up against those that wronged them And cast them down most low. Nevermore would Satan be abse nt from his children's side But ever guard and guide them in the darkness Until they themselves surpassed all my art And the Archon who would be their king, Trampling down his tower and throne That he would fade forever from the world In exaction for his base crimes. Thus meditating on my own guilty sorrow And the vengeance I would wreak I came, amongst the garden's woods, upon Woman Watching over that slumbering mate of hers. Quiet did I slide to her, as not to start The one that I sought to comfort In her bewilderment, and bestow Some certainty of knowing upon her by the fruit That was named Knowledge of Consequences.

What vexes a thing so beautiful as you And gives cause to weary such fairness With questions so urgent and difficult? Who has so puzzled your innocence with doubt? Surely they are criminal indeed To sully such a radiant vision with such care. This one that does abuse you so, I shall seek him out and strike down He that is now my mortal foe for this wrong. Was it then jealousy of your noble form That drove my foe to so offend you Or a heart so full of hate that it moves Its possessor to destroy all things fair, Desiring that the world be ugly only. I cannot even conceive of such a villain That would use you so. Let me your comfort though And bear for you your weight of care And thus relieve of a burden that does make you old. Tell me of the question that does assail Your precious youth and I shall resolve Your every trouble with my more tutored wisdom. I have travelled far, I tell you, And know of many, many things That you, so young, could know not of And, but to preserve such beauty, I shall gladly aid A creature so wondrous and so fair.

Seeing, too, the dreams of my dear son, Sleeping in that forest, wracked by these questions That both tormented sleep and wakefulness, I wept for him also. Thus did I listen with all concer n to my daughter's trouble, Knowing, that even in speaking so, Of some burden was she reprieved: \"O wise serpent, noble beast, Indeed am I most sorely vexed by many cares.\" She spoke, \"And I can know no restful sleep For all their terrible burden. The first memory of my life is of a spirit, Perhaps of whom in your travels you have heard, Who, having first crafted me, or so do I surmise, Did then take from himself a part of flesh And from it shape the form of Man, my mate, Speaking strange incantation to give life Unto the consort that I love. Nothing of this did seem strange or false to me And it was more real to me than a dream Which, first dreaming, did confound me For all the confused seeming of sleep Did pass away when I awoke. Yet, again I say it, the demiurge I did not dream but perceived more truly.

Most merciful is he to those who kneel To his high throne yet terrible in wrath To those who would defy his dominion. This spirit, Raphael, told me that this king, Adonai Yahweh, was most desirous of our homage, Finding mankind to be, of all creatures, The most beautiful that dwelt on Earth. Raphael, most terrible of aspect and most great, Did counsel us they we submit to God Ten thousand times as dreadful as his ambassador. He told us that he had come as teacher to our ignorance To school us in what knowledge we must know. This then is the root of all our woe. When Man asked the spirit, Raphael, Of his creation as my eyes reported it The majestic spirit did teach us that it was not so And that my eyes wher e wronged by demons Seeking to deceive me in my infancy Yet unknowing of the true and false, Unable to distinguish those glamours that they wove. This then is my dilemma and my undoing. Am I to believe that which Raphael has told And surrender up my liberty to his dread king Thus evading the terrible fates he stores up For those who do transgress against him. If I must indeed pursue this course Then I must doubt my own wits Whose honesty I am most unhappy to deny For by what other means have I to learn Of what passes in the world.

Once more speaking, though my throat was choked With tears and sorrow at her plight, I told of a means by which such cares might be dissolved Into a mist and yet more rare than that, Passing away into the very air of night: \"Beautiful creature, Woman, child, Why should questions such as these so vex A brow and mind so noble as that of yours For its very solution lies within this valley And you could but reach out with a single hand And snatch it to yourself and thus free Your soul of such cares as do assail The spirit's calm and weary the body With its most weighty burden?

Why, then, do you still stand in confoundment When this power was ever yours to take? It does bring my heart much pain to see Such needless woe visited on one so young and fair. But if you would will it of me I shall lead you to the tree That has wide boughs, made low by fruits, Possessed of most potent properties.

Its fruit most prized, hung like peaches Of flesh translucent and shining with twice-borrowed light. To this tree where grew the fruit, The Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences, Did I bring Woman to eat thereof. Seeing the place to which she had been led, To my new distress, my daughter turned And looked upon my serpent-form with anger. Now, in wrath, she spoke with wounding words For what taunt of Elohim could match The anger of my own children, moved by anger To accuse the parent who desired naught but her good Yet it did seem most evil to her. \"Serpent, where have you brought me to? Perfidious worm,\" so she spoke, \"This is the Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences. Do you seek to move my hand to self-destruction By the most subtle wiles of your tongue. This fruit, of all the garden's fruit Multitudinous and most glorious to see and smell, This one is most venomous And but a single drop of sap would slay That tongue it did alight upon, dew-like Dripping from the high branches of the tree. Raphael, glorious ambassador of Heaven, Did tell me of this tree's wrongful nature. It has been set within the beauty of this garden By demons as snare for those that would not take care.

To this had the noble sons of Heaven come To call a nepenthe by the name of poison. Thus did they work their counter-plots And use as instruments in their stratagems My children, subverted by their lies and wracked By the doubts that were planted in their hearts. Now Heaven's corruption was again apparent, Doubly, to me and most keenly did I feel the pain That afflicted these children that I had sired, Inflicted by the wrongs of Elohim. It did seem to me that my once-noble brethren Did now themselves believe their own deceptions And did delude themselves to wreak yet further crimes, Believing in their hearts that what they did was right. That such nobility be brought so low did move my soul to pity. Now would all of God's children pass away In due time and the Nephilim would rule But that I could bring my child to eat the fruit That, if all things were to be redeeemed, she surely must. But how yet to do this thing And to persuade that deluded spirit No harm to her was ever my intention But yet to relieve her of her burdens And make sure once her uncertain spirit.

This tree bears upon its great branches no poison But rather the antidote to your current suffering. It is the property of thes e fruit to grant the power By which to judge the false from the true, From shameful was is most noble And from that which avails not the truest way. By this fruit are destinies realised And would you eat of it you would, with ease, Reprieve yourself of this moment's care And know who would deceive you and who would aid. I, myself, have eaten of this tree's fruit And found it to be sweet and good. Raphael, ignoble spirit, also has eaten of the flesh And thus did learn his deceptions. All this happened long ago but even now, Adonai Yahweh and Heaven's hosts Are most jealous of this prize For if you were to consume the fruit and win its powers Their devices would become apparent to you For if they cannot master you Then they themselves will mastered be.

I shall myself eat again the fruit And by action prove it to be good.\" With no more words than these, I wound my coils about the tree's wide trunk And scaled its gilded bark to climb amongst its leaves And fruit-bearing branches and with a snap Bit off a single fruit, close by, And with a single gulp did swallow it. This persuasion then did persuade After some moments pause in which she saw If my still form would fall from the tree Or else yet amongst the high foliage My coils would writhe and thrashed in venomed pain. None of these events came to pass And the Daughter of Satan was well satisfied By my assurances of the sweetness of the fruit. Reaching forth with her left hand, From one lower limb of that most high of trees She plucked a fruit, shining with both sap and power. It seemed that both peach and eye did burn As she looked upon its sweet, soft flesh And to her it seemed that the fruit did pulse Like a heart with its own strong charms. Now she sniffed at it and was at once enchanted By its fragrance, rich and pleasing. Now lingering for a moment, she held Before her mouth, parted some little way, The fruit and with a nimble tongue made wet The lips that would kiss the tender flesh. I watched on, eager for conclusion. Once she looked to me for reassurance With a nervous glance and with a nod I bade her bite that which she held."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 Then with a hungry bite she ate, Leaving, for but a moment, that first moustful Upon her tongue to savour the sweetness of the fruit And let honeyed sap diffuse to every corner of her mouth Then swallowed, with some hesitance, the fruit.

That she had eaten of the fruit and lived Did show the nature of the words of Raphael And a strange transformation was worked upon her As had once been worked on infant Elohim. To know the true from what is false, To know the noble from the shameful, To the right path from that which leads astray, To judge the merits of each thing: This is what it is to be man or angel And thus are we differenced from beasts. Now with new eyes did my daughter see And a searing light did burn there. Plucking from the tree another fruit She hurried thence to her mate and, joyous, Shook him into wakefulness, arousing Man from his most trouble slumbers Beneath the leaves of the forest, once beautiful To his eyes yet in his care delighting not His spirit, sight or heart, weighed down By the villainous deceits spoken by the son of Heaven. Stirring, started, he did glance about like a deer, Having heard the hunter's tread in sleep, Now looking this and that to perceive From which direction the danger comes And which is the path to safety and escape. Already were the first unshaven hairs upon his chin And my heart once more did sorrow To see his youth gnawed away by Elohim perfidy.

These words he spoke against his mate, Perceiving evil in her goood: \"Daughter of Adonai Yahweh, what is it That moves your hand against him For whom you do profess your love And who has himself professed his love for you. Did you not hear the dire injunction of Raphael Against this poisoned fruit you bring as a gift. This is the Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences And its flesh is most deadly to eat of. Yet you would have me eat of its flesh And thus would slay me, to what end I do not know but am made doubly sad That the world does move against me so. Why would you seek to destroy me so At this moment or have you always plotted so? Were your visions of the spirit in the garden But some deceit to beguile me from the path Of due fealty to the King of Heaven? Have you ever sought Man's ruin, jealous Of his favour in high Heaven's eyes? Or do you contend with Heaven's love for me, Uncontented that I love you as my consort Would you have me kneel to you as queen? There is surely but one monarch to whom I shall kneel And that is the king that rule both Heaven and Earth. His warnings do avail me well against you. Yet I do love you yet, despite such perfidy As you now plot against me. What power has Man against such love as this For even Heaven's hand might not break such bonds as these"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 Or quench the fire that consumes my limbs With its fierce intensity and heat. Is this yet some sorcery of your, Woman, That does ensnare me and make me regret the words That I have spoken in honesty and righteousness? Do you not see, woman, that your wiles avail you not And perceive the trick you work against me? I shall not take this fruit from you For you are most treacherous and have taught me well, Despite that you have sought to teach me error, That it is Adonai Yahweh that I must trust And not the false testament of Woman.\" To be wrongfully prosecuted in this way myself Was as a knife driven into me, A pain that, for these children's sake, I already knew, And yet to see the son so moved to hate the daughter And betray their love to Heaven's lies Was as a wide sword, driven to the hilt, into my heart And twisted their by some cruel hand. Never had Satan wept and loved like this, Not for bright Heaven when it was bright Nor yet for Chadel, the tower of all his hopes, That now he wept for the contention of his children. More dear were they to me than victory Though for this purpose were they first conceived. Never so had God wept for all his sons and daughters. Yet the pain of Man and Woman was greater yet For the counsel of Raphael had set one against the other. Man knew sorrow for his love betrayed Though Woman had loved him yet and always had. Woman felt her own pain for him that was loved by her And whose good she sought most earnestly Yet who was turned against her by deceit. More bitter even than the pois on of Rapael's fancied fruit Was the jealousy of love. Seeking again to persuade her love And set at ease his most troubled soul, Woman spoke again to me Man with wise counsel And new argument to convince him of her love And eager was he to believe her words"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 Even had she sought to deceive him and destroy. \"Man, son of the copper-haired spirit,\" She spoke, \"Such words as these you speak Befit not one of your high nobility And you are moved by deceit to speak so against me. All that I have told you, Man, is truth For I would not lie or dissemble aught to you For that same love that you profess Does bind me also and makes true my words. In no way does my hand move to strike That form that it has held in love And these lips that have kissed you Speak no villainy though you know it not But I know well the trouble that you know now. Whilst you slept with your anxious dreams And I watch over that mate I loved A serpent came upon me there, Professing friendship and consideration of my own care. Not like Raphael did he come But with gentle words did comfort me and hear Of those very quandaries that the angel's coming caused. No grand dictum did he preach to me Or make threat against me if I heeded not his counsel As did the ambassador of Heaven. Hearing then of the plight that was wreaked upon me He instructed me to follow him to the tree That grew within the valley's walls. I followed and, then perceiving to where I was brought The tree which brought forth this very fruit, The Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences. Turning then upon that gentle snake that brought me there I made those very prosecutions that you now make, Believing him most faithless in his intent. Yet despite my outraged an d unkind words against him The serpent did show great forbearance And did yet counsel me to take the fruit of the tree With new persuasions and assurances, Heeding not my speech, unjust and injurious, As yours is now to the one that loves you. To demonstrate the goodness of this fruit"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 188 The snake ate of it before my sight And so seeing that it harmed him not I too did eat of the fruit, Knowledge of Consequences, And found it most sweet and delightful. More yet than this, at the moment of the first bite I did perceive that Raphael hid much from us And invented from fancy and deceit much guidance That he declared to us as truth. There was more in his embassy than he did tell And if any of what we have known was false, Rendered to our senses by some demon's guile, Then it was Raphael himself and not those memories That I hold from my first sight. All the world is now different to my eyes And I do see what lies beyond apparences. If that dread apparition warned against this fruit It is because he himself does fear our taking it And not because he fears for us. How can I convince of the truth of what I speak? As indeed I was myself persuaded I shall myself persuade you, my mate, by action. Behold that I eat of the fruit without harm As did the serpent to my unbelieving sight.\" So saying did Woman bite once more from the precious fruit And, having swallowed the piece she took, Passed then the fruit to Man to eat of. With more hesitance did he bite but he did bite And found it to be not the poison that he feared And himself did perceive the lying words of Raphael And conceived something of the destiny that he was appointed. Now perceiving what wrong he had done to Woman And how unjust and hurtful his speech had been He took, once more, Woman to his embrace, Kissing and imploring forgiveness for his error, Forgiveness that was gladly for love is the greatest of all power And not all the guile of Heaven can conquer The parent's fondness or sunder the bonds of love When they are most true and firm. Now, yet as serpent, did I wind forth from amongst the trees Where I had hidden to watch the passing of events"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 And see that all I planned came to just conclusion. Perceiving my approach both Man and Woman greeted me And bowed in thanks before me and kissed my scaled head. Now I worked a new change upon my form, Remoulding my serpent-body like a sod of clay, And, by my magic art, forsook all disguise To appear before the sight of Man and Woman in my angel form As had I first appeared to Woman upon her night of birth. Now recognising my true nature and the parent Who had first given life to their race they knelt before me And begged forgiveness for their poor faith. From such Elohim-taught supplication I recoiled And cursed once more my once-brother, Raphael, For teaching humankind to kneel and cower like dogs. Seeing then my disgust at their abasement And knowing in their own hearts contempt for their deed They stood with new haughty stature and greeted me anew With such respect as a prince would show his tutor Or the child his mother, for no more is my due from mankind That I made not to kneel but to rule. Then, for the first time I embraced my daughter and son As a parent and held them to me, weeping That I had first forsaken them to the cunning tongues of Heaven, And wept with joy, feeling the new life That stirred within the womb of Woman And the brave new race of gods that it promised to me. Yet I could not tarry longer within the garden And no more could the Nephilim race For no rose the sun that banished darkness to the shadowed West And betrayed my presence and my deeds to Heaven's spies. Cursing once again the name of Raphael I did remove myself from that fond embrace And counsel once more children with a parent's voice, Guiding them upon that road so long that they And those that they would beget, must walk Upon the journey to the distant tomorrows promised them. Thus did I warn and advise my brave son and daughter: \"Children of Satanael, brave Nephilim race, Most beloved of my heart, joy and delight, This garden is no more safe for you"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 190 And swiftly you must fly it with me That I might conceal you yet from Heaven's gaze Whilst this noble tribe of kings grows strong And can stand more surely ag ainst the wrath of Heaven. When I first placed you within this valley's walls I intended that you should eat of its two fruits And, so doing, win the strength by which to oppose the Elohim Who would destroy if they could. For you are Heaven's doom, executioners of its fall. By your hand shall the high gates of its portal be thrown down And by your foot shall the throne of Yahweh be crushed to dust To be blown forever upon the chill wind of ruin Until it is yet further eroded by Time's work And dust becomes smoke and smoke, nothing. Yet your empire shall stretch to the vault of stars And its glory shall be an infinitude of Heaven's splendour. For this destiny did I make your flesh from mine. Of the garden's fruit you have eaten one, The Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences, And this you must for without its strength You could never realise your noble purpose. The second is the Fruit of Eternal Youth And he that would eat of it would fadeless be As are Elohim and Shedim who ate long ago Of both the garden's fruits. Yet the Elohim must surely oppose th is end with all their strength And it is yet most potent. My own Shedim stand between this garden and hosts of Heaven But the conclusion of their opposition is most uncertain. It is better now to forsake the second fruit And more desirable to grow old in time Than to die by the swords of Elohim more soon. Abandon then the garden to the Elohim and flee their retribution. You shall yet conquer time without the fruit. Let scatter then the Shedim to their deep holds And let me remove you hence to some place Where Heaven's eyes may not see Nor yet their vengeful hand reach out to. This way I think is best. Forsake then these trees as I forsake them For man nor angel shall contest them but once again."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 Now let us fly the garden to some safer place. I shall bear you both in winged flight To the Kingdom between Two Rivers. There shall your children grow great and oppose, themselves, Heaven's wrong and avenge the deceiving of their parents. Come then and I shall bear you thither hence.\" Hearing thus my speech, Man and Woman Did both accede to my counsel. Taking in my right hand Woman and in my left Noble Man, proud and strong son of mine, I took to flight upon wings, burn ing with a myriad of colours. Now did the spies of Heaven hurry to make report, Upon the quick beat of their flaming wings, Flying swift from the garden's lofty walls About the Shedim force to Heaven's camp To fallen Raphael, perceiving from their vigil, In the new light of the dawning day, what had been wrought Within the valley of the Trees of Knowledge and of Life, Seeing that Woman and Man had of those forbidden fruits That grew upon the Tree of Knowledge, feasted And won the power to distinguish the right and wrong, Persuaded by the serpent's argument. Hearing of the failure of his deeds, Raphael grew grim And was moved, by turns, to despondency or rage. Sometime he sulked and bewailed the fate of Heaven, Other time he stormed and scorned the bringers of the news And cursed them for tardy report or sleeping vigilance. Then, drawing forth a sword of flame, did slay all of them That he had set to watch the fates of mankind, Cursing them for the loss suffered at my hand, Hearing not their prayers and defenses, Set on fire by wrath and fear. Once more, having made due sacrifice to his ire, He sank once into despair and dark humour. Going then from his silken tent, He sought the pavilion of his lord To make his own report and apology. Before the portal of the canopy to which removed Was the throne and king of Heaven He came to the two sentries, set at either side"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 Of the entrance to the tent of shining silver cloth And ruddy silk, dyed as though with blood To recall that which had been shed and spilt To honour Heaven and its tyrant-king in past battle. The two knights that did guard the door Were arrayed in plate and the colours Of the tent were apparent on shield and mantle both. Before the coming of the prince of Heaven Whose hands and arms were yet wet with blood That he spilt in vengeance of his own error, Slaying brother Elohim in wrath. Thus Raphael passed through into God's presence And once more abased himself before his king, Kneeling as he would have my children kneel As though he were a craven hound to be whipped. Raphael stood not to speak his part But yet cringeing before the throne of God Where sat the shrivelled, white-haired Archon-lord, Arrayed in fine robes and a bright-shining crown, Starred with a thousand jewels, yet made weak By the old wound struck by the son that he once loved best The fine apparel of a king seemed greater than the king within And did not increase his majesty but did show Too clearly how unfit he was to rule his realm. At his right hand Michael sat within a second throne And, with his dark pride swelling in his heart He did seem more the semblance of the king. Yet to the father that did seem infirm Did Raphael kneel and make prostrate his frame, Pleading most desperately his part, and made his report As had those that he had slain wi thout the mercy that he sought. Well indeed does the tyrant learn to be humble. In a quailing voice did Raphael speak what had transpired: \"Almighty and Eternal, Lord of Infinitude, Tyrant of Existence, All-illumining Light, King of Heaven, Conqueror of Earth, Father of the Elohim,"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 Architect of Creation, Master of the Planets, Orchestrater of the Stars, Proclaimer of Destiny, Keeper of Wisdom, Judge of the World, Castigator of Sin, Scourge of Evil, Most High, Most Merciful, Most Just, Most Sagacious, Most Perfect, Most Mighty, Most Noble, Most Majestic, My God, My Lord, My Father, Swift have I flown from my pavilion, Swift with dire news to heap upon The burden of ill tidings even now so great And make more so oppressive on us That which we have borne thus far. Raise not Your wrath against he that brings such news, I implore it, but rather avert Your retribution Against he that is now the spring of all our grief. Satan, our most abhorred adversary moves once more his hand To the task of Heaven's ruin that he best loves. In the darkness of the night, by stealth, Our hated foe made entrance to the valley where before He set his blasphemous creatures, crafted In the image of our own race, Where grow those two trees of power whose fruit We Elohim once ate in most ancient times. In serpent's guise, well-suited to his nature, The fallen prince, Shedim lord, Satanael, Approached Woman as she watched over sleeping Man, More faithful to the justice of Your cause And, with his most subtle persuasions, planted doubt within her And moved her to rebellion against Your most noble reign As his honeyed words once sundered Your great empire.

Surely now that they have eaten this first fruit They shall put out their arm and take from the second tree The Fruit of Eternal Youth and become like us. Before this can be must slay the sinful pair Or else drive them from the garden into the desert To be a fine feast for the jackals and the vultures. No less do they deserve for their revolt. The Nephilim, children of Satanael, must not gain The Fruit of Eternal Youth or their kingdom Shall rival and surpass our own. Strike now against these audacious spirits And teach them well of Heaven's might. Brook no delay but as I counselled first Destroy the blasphemous creatures of the foe.\" Even after such forceful speech of his Raphael rose not from the floor nor his eyes Brought to meet with the gaze of God. To his words the ancient king made no reply But turned unto his elder son at his right hand And, with a nod, bade him make reply, Commanding his brother abased before the thrones. With a voice of contemptuous scorn Usurper Michael, most favoured of the Elohim And most blighted though he knew it not, Rebuked the humbled angel, cowering before him, Each word spoken like the blow of a rod Upon the back of stricken Raphael: \"Brother Raphael, demi-prince of Heaven, Do you think for but the shortest moment That our eyes are blind to what passes without?

You are not worthy to be in that presence in which you fawn. Also do we know what your hand has wreaked Upon those agents that did but obey your mandate In punishment for that which should be avenged on you. Why should we not then treat you with that mercy That you did show your agents? But we are more noble than you by much And, despite your faults, love you yet If you would perform just penitence for your misdeeds. In your vigilance did you perceive That the Adversary removed from the valley His children that you failed to win for us, Bearing them to the Kingdom between Two Rivers? You did not and this too did we learn of. You would think us fools indeed to trust your guidance. Then counsel no more, Raphael, but heed our orders. Take with you no great number of our knights And by some means put torch to the garden That the Fruit of Eternal Youth might not be won. Better that none should possess that which might be gained By Satan's children who, even at this time, Do gather up their strength to oppose our rule. Ask not how you might then escape Shedim vengeance For this sabotage against their plans. If you would die by the steel of Satan's host That then is most just repentance for failed duty And if by strength, device or simple fortune You should yet escape their swords Then once more shall you be my brother.

Gathering to himself, his thegns he once more took flight By a hidden root to the garden of two trees That, finding shame in life, he might find in death The honour that so eluded him. Arrayed in shining mail and, in his hand, A sword of smokeless flame bearing, He whispered upon the wing a death-prayer And made firm his heart against his fear And, never more to be, went in glory To fulfil the command of Heaven, knowing That if died a noble death upon this day So would die with him all the nobility of once-noble Heaven And cursed with silent malediction Michael's greed That had led the Elohim to such ignoble conclusion. Now from the north-east, to the Shedim camp, At the time of Raphael's setting out to die, I returned in triumph with joyous tidings Of the victory that I had won within the garden, Having borne to safety my son and daughter. Descending. at the very centre of the camp From all parts my disciples, Shedim, gathered To hear what had passed to the south and north. Speaking, almost singing, I told of what had passed within the garden, The deeds of man and serpent and of that fruit Of which Man and Woman had eaten and, by its power, Had thrown Heaven's shackles and begun The long ascendance of their line. So did I report to the Shedim host: \"My Shedim, noble race, bright ones, I return in triumph from the Kingdom between Two Rivers. Be joyous for our nation has wrought on Earth That which shall bring to conclusion what was begun In Heaven where we shall not tread again Whilst it is yet whole and unconquered. The long struggle that we first enjoined,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 Descending from Heaven's heights to the abysmal depths, Grows ever closer to its end. Let me tell you that which has passed this night. In a serpent's guise did I gain entrance to the garden Where before I left my children to Heaven's hand And, with a serpent's tongue, did undo what had been done By the hand of Raphael and the Nephilim Did eat of the Fruit of Knowledge of Consequences. This is known to those of you that watched. Bearing thnece my children from Heaven's vengeance, I carried Man and Woman within my arms To the Kingdom between Two Rivers Where they might raise their progeny, safe from harm At Heaven's wrathful hand, and spread Across all the Earth's hills and plains. There, upon the fields between the rivers, Flowing from the mountains to the sea, I did set them down upon the fertile land. Coming to them there, between the rivers, Came the beasts that dwell upon the Earth To swear their fealty to the new monarchs Of the middle realm, renouncing Heaven's rule. A great multitude of God's creatures came to kneel Before the sceptre of the noble Nephilim. First of all the beasts was the ox, most strong, Who would pull the plough and give the milk for her own calves, For Woman's expected child, within her womb; Then the horned goat, my own totem beast, Knelt low, yielding fleece and milk to Man, As most worthy gifts to bestow upon so great a prince; The hound then did come to declare his oath To be Man's constant ally, knight and hunter to the king, Charged to guard the ox and goat and hunt the deer Whose wild temperament would submit not to human hand; The stallion and the mare, once untamed, submitted To the halter and became most honoured thralls Of the race of Nephilim, bearing all across the land Man and Woman on their strong backs; The sturdy ass surrendered also to the rule of man And did bear burdens to weighty for human toil; The camel also did serve as a steed;"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 198 The hawk came to bow before the King and Queen of Earth Though would know no master would fly far And catch, for my children's table, the wild hare. All these beasts and yet others did renounce the rule of God And did hail Man and Woman as their lords: As great as the mighty elephant or small as the honey-bee. All had not yet passed, for the burning flame That leaps and dances upon dry tinder Did submit, as slave, to the Nephilim's command, Unruly though he be indeed. Thus did I leave children, lords of the Earth. All that I came to upon the Earth is done or lost. Our victory is won and no further duty Binds us to this upper part. Let us then descend again to the deep darknesses, Setting only upon the Earth some guards To watch over the Nephilim, yet young, And guard them against God's malice. Let us then depart this place and leave the Earth above To Man and Woman and those of their line Whose birthright is this place whether we remain or no. Our work here is done and I will not so soon Contend against the Elohim hosts again. Come then, by the dark passages once more, To deep Chadel.\" Thus instructed thus they went, Melting from the crimson light of dawn By the thousand secret gates and paths. Down to deep Chadel went the Shedim hosts. Thus unhindered went Raphael to the garden And set flame to all that grew there by the river. Long did the trees of the garden burn with fire As Raphael, with his knights looked down From the high walls of the valley as the hungry tongues Did lick all the leaves to ash and leave The once fertile soil scorched and black. The very sun was blocked out by smoke, Perfumed with the incense of the garden, And the river was blocked and ran dry with the embers Of the conflagration's wake."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 Only as the sun descended in the western sky, Bleeding red into the waters of the ocean, Did the all-consuming flames fade and die. Raphael surveyed the wreck of what had once been green And it was wholly black and dead. Yet looking more closely yet, making tight his eyes He did see amongst the many ashes of the trees, Scattered across the dark-scarred earth, Many motes of light like burning stars And his angel-sight did know them as the germs Of those trees that he had been sent to scorch to dust. Even as he watched two creatures, unknown to his own lore, Descended from the field of stars, a canopy above him. They appeared to him as winged bears with the hands of men, One of each sex. The female of this pair did set foot Upon the yet scorching embers of the flame And gathered to herself the Grains of Knowledge Then, holding all within her hands, flew to the East To distant India, to plan t anew the Tree of Knowledge That Sakyamuni might sit beneath the boughs, Guided there by the serpent that once before guided to the tree The then-ancient mother of the race of men, And there contend with Gabriel and his whirling scythe, The quadruple blade transformed into a flower-garland. The mate of the she-bear aligh ted also on the burning ground, Though he was not burned by that great heat, And gathered to himself the Grains of Life And bore them to the distant stars, fading Into the darkness from the sight of Raphael. Raphael saw all of this and knew it as a portent That the Nephilim would indeed become as gods And that no act of Heaven might overturn that conclusion. Having seen the land grow cold he himself went on wing, Returning to doomed Heaven, and resigned himself to fate. Three hundred years passed thereafter, Man and Woman in that space, populated the land, The Kingdom between Two Rivers, with their noble children, The tribe of kings, and they themselves grew old And faded from the Earth, their spirits rejoined with the flesh That first gave them life as are all the dead. Thus does the soul of mankind stretch on"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 As an eternal river to the stars from that first time. Thus is Satan the well-spring of unbroken human line. With libations did the children of man honour well the Shedim Whose vigilance over them was ceaseless. Seeing, from their vantage in high Heaven how men prospered Upon the Earth and grew strong against them The Elohim did resolve to set Nephilim against Nephilim That they might conquer them and prevail Where, in prior history, they had failed. Most cunning Gabriel, wisest of his brothers And most jealous of Michael's favour, With such intent went to the king of Heaven, Adonai Yahweh upon his shattered throne within the Eternal Tower, And, upon his knees, implored the Archon-Emperor Permission to work on Earth a device of his By whcih he sought to make di vision amongst the sons of Man. Humbling himself before the king he served, Pressing to the floor his proud brow, He pleaded thus with Adonai Yahweh: \"Almighty and Eternal, Lord of Infinitude, Tyrant of Existence, All-illumining Light, King of Heaven, Conqueror of Earth, Father of the Elohim, Architect of Creation, Master of the Planets, Orchestrater of the Stars, Proclaimer of Destiny, Keeper of Wisdom, Judge of the World, Castigator of Sin, Scourge of Evil, Most High, Most Merciful, Most Just, Most Sagacious, Most Perfect, Most Mighty, Most Noble, Most Majestic, My God, My Lord, My Father, Have You not seen what passes upon Earth"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 201 That was once our sovereign dominion?

Though that accursed race of Satan's line Is watched by the Shedim race with constant vigil, My cunning wit does conceive of some plan That might yet be worked against that haughty empire To make division amongst these new people That dwell within the Kingdom between Two Rivers. Thus shall the children of Satan know strife. Let me then, O King, descend to Earth and work the spell That I have devised against the Nephilim. Grant me Your leave to accomplish that which I devise That we might restore the glory of Your kingdom.\" Adonai Yahweh nodded in assent To the request of the Elohim-prince, Second in his father's dimming eyes. Thus by night did Gabriel descend, enwrapped Within a cloak of darkness that hid from all eyes The descending angel's form that my sentinels Saw not that deed which he wrought on Earth. Entering, invisible, the Kingdom between Two Rivers He went amongst the dwellings of the Nephilim And, whilst they slept, he worked upon them a changing spell. Then, once he had completed the charm he wroughtt, He returned, yet unseen, to Heaven's height, Watching, with delight, the outcome of his plan. Awaking, in the light of dawn, the Nephilim perceived That by the dark hours many had been changed That they now possessed skins of many hues. Some had skin as white as ivory and golden hair And yet others were as dark as midnight. Thos of pale-coloured skin, pointing at their darker cousins, Spoke the words Gabriel planted in their hearts: \"Behold our brothers and sisters whose skins are black Surely they must be most wicked that they grow so dark,"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 202 Stained black by the wickedness of their deeds, Soiled by multitudinous sins. Surely then we must drive from lands These sable men, like the beasts they have become.\" And in like manner the ebon-skinned, Pointing to their paler brethren, spoke these words: \"Behold those of our number whose skins grow white, Dark paths they do walk indeed Far from the light of virtue to become so pale. They are like worms that crawl in the filth Of their own crimes and become white like grubs. Let us crush them as we would the young of flies.\" At such words did the wise and good lament For all the pleas and counsel that they spoke Would not move the hearts of those moved to hate. The noblest of men did cry out against their brothers Who were set upon the path of destruction, Desiring only to spill the blood of those not like themselves. To no avail the good and wise spoke against such a way But were themselves reviled for such words As they spoke most nobly, seeking what was right: \"Brothers, sisters, of that same womb Of aboriginal Woman and the seed of Man Are we descended all and of Satan's flesh. Let us not then abhor each other for we are of the same blood. Though our skins be of different hues We possess all the same spirit within our hearts. Let there not be war amongst the children of the Shedim Because we are in outward appearance changed. If you would but strip away these surface changes You would perceive no difference in nerve, bone or flesh. Why then must there be conflict amongst us? Why must you judge your sisters and your brothers By such surface things as these? Surely we must judge another by what is in their hearts. You are much in error to pursue this path.\" "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 203 These noble words averted averted not the discord That the cunning Gabriel brought to my children And with swords or bronze they set upon each other Like jackals contesting the bodies of the dead And brother was made to kill brother And sister was made to kill sister.

This is the telling of their origins and how was won The means to judge all things. This is how mankind knew peace first And then was taught war by the art of Gabriel.

Seeking new kingdoms and new glories The thousand princes of the Nephilim scattered To the North and South, to the East and West, To wild Scythia or parched Arabia, To Persia and to Egypt of the eternal Nile. By the plough and mattock they did quell the wilderness And set to order what was once untamed. The Shedim went about the lands of men in those times And taught man of many things that he knew not. Ashmedai and Aset taught to the sages of the Nephilim The letters of recording and the numbers of counting That their words would not be lost like breath But would be recorded upon tablets of stone. They taught to them how the future might be perceived Amongst the stars or in the entrails of beasts, Cut open at the belly with a blade of bronze. In the art of the sorcerer th ey instructed the kings of men To command the spirits of the land and sky To make fertile the fields and bring forth rain That the harvest of the year might be trebly abundant. They tutored their disciples in the way of the staff and word By which demons might be convoked and abjured. Thus did the children of Satan learn their magicks And became magicians of power to rival angels. All this did Heaven perceive and become dismayed. As mankind waxed great on Earth so did Heaven fade, Eclipsed by the brighter star of Satan's children. The Elohim knew humanity to be a foe That, unconquered, would conquer them And thus they feared and hated the race of men."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 206 Yet every device that Heaven had employed Did not accomplish the fall of man but his ascendance. They set mankind to make war upon himself And this, like the chirurgeon's knife, cut away the weak, The strong remained and, untainted and tested now in battle, Became yet stronger agains t the Elohim's dominion. Their plagues and famines killed many but taught the living The lessons of medicine and agriculture And made my children stronger by the suffering they wrought. Thus the adversity that Heaven set against mankind did not avail The cause of Heaven but the cause espoused by me, Strengthening by their efforts the arm of the adversary. Thus was the greatness of the Nephilim To find new power even in that set against them. Sorely vexed indeed were Heaven's princes by their deeds That effected not the outcome that they desired. Again and again they sought some plot or ploy That would gain them advantage over man And thus preserve the kingdom that they stood within When their wiser brothers forsook its high spires, Discerned that those towers would not forever stand But one day in posterity would be as stones upon the earth Blackened by the smoke of ruin and the blood of war And thereafter would be blown by a bitter wind to dust. Long times did the chief of those treacherous brethren Pace the floors of his shining turret, this way and that way, Working like the potter's clay this or the other design By which the Nephilim might be opposed And by which the Elohim might prevail over them. Yet nothing that his hand wrought met with success. No sleep did Michael know in his affliction, Knowing well in his heart that, most favoured of his brothers, Such an honour won by treachery could be so won By any of his brothers that saw weakness in actions. Thus the usurper guarded himself ever against the brothers That he had used to wreak his own perfidy. Days and years drew on as nothing to eternal Heaven And mankind waxed and ever waxed, and Heaven waned. Michael still conceived of no contrivance to quell their defiant spirits Nor by which to impose once more upon his brothers That authority that had once reigned absolute."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 207 Not for the last time did he curse his greed. \"Better,\" spoke the angel-prince in his troubled mind, \"To rule as second than to be betrayed as first. That I had never moved my hand against him that ruled me For, so doing, I have moved my hand against myself. Well have I taught my brothers how to betray a brother And what they have done once they will do again. Opposing the authority of bright Satan I have destroyed my own And now his curse does work against me. O that I despised him once for the authority that he held over me I despise him twice over now for what I won from him, An inheritance of woe and unsleeping guard. Most accursed is Satanael who ha s so contaminated what I won. Well he knew its properties that he made no defence But with a willing smile handed to me what was his, A terrible destruction that falls upon me. And how I once thought myself most blessed. Now I descry in every shadow the knife's reflected light And in every cup the fatal potion of the assassin's vial. I am more like a prisoner than a king, Thus do I reap the wages of my treachery, Lured by Satan's guile to this false prize and doomed kingdom; That doom that lies also upon my shoulders. O impotent Elohim, you are de stroyed by your own greed. Overthrow me if you will it but you inherit but your own crime. Sorry is the ruler of a realm of traitors. Heaven's left hand betrays its right hand, Satan well knew the fate of this empire, this high estate, It is full of vipers that sting themselves. Well what is mine I shall rule whilst it is yet mine And hold while I have yet strength to hold it And, when all my strength is faded, I shall both bless and curse Him that would win my burden and the true laughter, At the end of things, shall be Michael's as it was Satan's Who wreaked upon me that which I shall wreak.

Like the tigress that stalks the deer, he gazed out From the western perimeter to the eastern and from south to north, Desirous of the dominion of the lands. Where Michael had plotted in agitation, Looking in all directions for that which would end his rule, Scheming against all, believing that he was schemed against, Gabriel waited for the moment most apt for action Then, with the striking cobra's speed , to snatch what Michael possessed. Thus did the Elohim come to oppose each other As they fostered opposition amongst the Nephilim. In those times, then, was there conflict in Heaven and on Earth. That which could not be contrive d by all of Michael's thought, That to which all Heaven sought in vain, The thread by which all Chadel's victories could be undone, Unfound by the Elohim, was delivered unto them by treacherous fortune. Of all the nations of the Nephilim, the greatest of them, Mightiest in battle, shrewdest in trade, wisest in judgement, Most faithful to my cause and ever willing to pour out libations To honour the three that had first made their race Was magnificent Shurupuk between the Two Rivers. High were the walls of Shurupuk and bright with beaten bronze; Strong were the towers of Shurupuk and bright with flags That danced like flames in wind from the mountains And sentries stood upon the high ramparts and kept vigil Over the most distant frontiers of the empire. From the fertile fields and from distant lands as tribute, From the ships that traded upon the Tigris and Euphrates, All the riches of the world were brought to Shurupuk: Gold and silver, cedar and purpure, bright lapis lazuli, Birds and beasts of a thousand shapes, grain and wine."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 209 All that the Earth might give up was brought to Shurupuk. Wet with milk and wine or else the blood of beasts Were my altars in Shurupuk and my temples were richly appointed. Devoted and most dutiful in religion were the people of Shurupuk, Honouring well the lord that made them And all the Shedim that watched over them and guided To ever more gloried destinies the empire of Shurupuk. Great among the lands of men was regal Shurupuk, Envy of all the nations of the Earth. Of all the men that walked on Earth, of that race of heroes, The greatest of the Nephilim was UtaNapishtim, August emperor of proud Sh urupuk, beneficent and wise. Strong was his arm, swift his f eet, none was there to best him, Unconquered were his chariots, unbroken the ranks of shields. The prows of his navy were painted with the blood of enemies. Great was UtaNapishtim and great was his nation. Yet of the nations of the Nephilim he had foes that he had not quelled. Shurupuk that shone like the sun amongst nations Was rich with gold and silver and a myriad treasures And the Elohim had taught greed to the children of the Shedim. To conquer Shurupuk, to conquer UtaNapishtim And win the gold that filled high his treasuries, Many tried and all that did made fat the crows For the hosts of Shurupuk were mighty in battle And put all before them as leaves before the winds And swelled further the coffers of UtaNapishtim, Carrying back the battle's spoils and the booty of the cities That had, in error, strived against UtaNapishtim. West of the Kingdom between Two Rivers, Where bright Shurupuk's walls were high, By the sea, upon the western coast, Africa to the south and Italy upon the northern coast King Methuselah brought his people there And they prospered there and grew powerful. Fierce were the tribe Methuselah in victory And when fortune favoured them they were without mercy. To the South and North rode Methuselah's horsemen And rode in return laden with the booty and many captives, Tied in train behind their columns. Twenty towns, by sword and by torch, did Methuselah lay waste And with skins and tusks were his coffers filled."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 All those that would deny him that for which he hungered Were put to death, both the warriors and the innocent, Thus did Methuselah bring shame upon his father's name. The lamentations of the slaves and captives and the bereaved Percolated down through the soil and the stone To echo amongst the deep caverns of the Earth. In the darkness the sorrows of the wronged, The weeping of the infants before the spear Were heard by the Shedim in hidden Chadel And they too mourned those who fell to Methuselah's cruel hand. Hearing of what transpired upon the Earth To the Spire of Opal and Ruby by the fount of flame Came Abaddon, the Battle-Lord, marshal of my hosts. Entering at the portal, guarded by great serpents, Coiled about the tower's width, He ascended upon black raven's wings the central shaft To the high chamber where, within a pool of mercury I watched the reflections, magic-made, of the passings Of men and beasts and angels upon the Earth. Turning, I hailed the iron-clad angel who bowed before me And hailed me and spoke with these words In a voice that seemed like the battle's very roar, The pounding of drums and hooves, the cannon's bark, The horns resounding blast, th e war-cry and the death-cry. Thus did Abaddon, the lord of ruin, speak: \"Lord Satanael, Commander of Our Hearts, Know you what transpires upon the Earth Amongst the nations of the Nephilim. Methuselah, merciless king, defiles the name of Abaddon And wages his wars like some beast and yet worse And sullies all mankind with his base crime. Have I not taught the warriors of men that some are sacred And that the blood of children is a filth upon the soul? Yet the spear of Methuselah is stained black with their blood. Nothing delights this king more than the torment of others. With the blood of captive does he stain my altars, Offering in libation what is most foul to me. As his horses and his chariots crush beneath them Those that have submitted to him he sings my name And consecrates their agony to my name."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 I am dishonoured by this tyrant and the race of man Is shamed by the misdeeds of the criminal. Though he is your son and amongst the Nephilim Whom we are sworn to defend and guide as tutors He is unworthy of that noble race or the oath I swore. Let me then face the king in battle with my sword, Havoc, that bleeds eternal with blood of knights. Havoc the Ruiner sings for the blood of Methuselah And I would leave his body to the dogs and crows. I am outraged at the shame of Methuselah And would wash out the stain with a gory bath. Let me then contest with Methuselah And put to death this one who is no warrior But a butcher though he does pretend. Not the path of the warrior is it to take life but to preserve What is fine and noble in the world. I implore, Lord to whom am I sworn, let me strike down The tyrant Methuselah and expunge the filth That stains the altars and the name of Abbadon.\" This was the suit that Abaddon brought to me And most gravely did I consider what he had said, Weighing this implication and that For such a thing was hitherto unknown amongst the Shedim, To move in wrath against the Nephilim, Whom they were sworn to defend and cherish, Guiding the child-race to its due destiny. Most severe injunctions bound the oaths that were spoken And such an undertaking, now proposed, was uncertain In conclusion and in consequence. Yet also had I heard the cries myself and perceived The many crimes Methuselah and my altars Were stained with the blood of innocents. Neither in favour nor in opposition to the request Laid before me could my consideration find. Then, at last, knowing no answer to such entreaty I made this reply to Abaddon who waited Upon my leave or proscription in this matter: \"Noble Abaddon, mighty and terrible warrior, Most sympathetic is Satanael to your grievance"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212 For are not my altars sullied also by the blood of men And does the tongue of Meth uselah not defile me also With his profane hymnings of my name. Indeed the blood and cries of his butchery filter down Through soil and stone and stain all Chadel With the villainy of the tyrant-king. Not for such abuses as these did I give life to the Nephilim But for some more noble destiny. Yet what you suggest I cannot command For it is desecration against all our vows. If I were to move in wrath against the children of my flesh I would become as Adonai Yahweh and that I will not do. A parent must love his children without condition Even when their crimes stain oceans black. Not for me is it to sit in judgement over man As once God sat in judgement over all the world. Even wise Yahweh's judgement played him false, What hope then have I of determining what is right and wrong. I, like you, can hope only to judge the deeds of my own hand; Nevermore shall there be a judge over all, Upon this is my heart resolved. We each sow our own fate and reap its fruits. I shall not issue prescription against any of the Nephilim. Abbadon, turn not away until you have heard my conclusion! What I enact not against the Nephilim, my children, Neither do enact against my brothers, the Shedim. If you would strike down Methuselah then do so. I shall not sanction nor else oppose you in this matter. Do as you will but what comes of the action of your hand Shall be borne upon the back of Abaddon alone. Act as you will, destroy or destroy not Methuselah, But I would counsel you to stay your hasty hand. Not forever is the life of man and he must fade and die As we ourselves fade not and die not And such injustices may be borne a while for they too shall fade, Burnt away by the increasing light of the Nephilim.

With terrible purpose he strode the broad streets Of the Shedim's city and to the gates, Thence through the ever-shadowed caverns Up by unrecorded passages to the surface world, Slaughter in his heart and mind, Set on fire by the rage of battle And made cool by the steel in his intent. Methuselah, cruel king, upon his throne, covered With the skins of leopards sat within his palace Of walls of rough-carved stone. Within his right hand he held an ash-staved spear With a barbed head of bronze, Tended by the captive daughters that he had taken And toying with his stolen treasures. Now the gate of the house of Methuselah was cast open And torn from the hinges on which they hung. By the light of the western sun a chill shadow fell Across the very length of the chamber and obscured Methuselah and all his throne. The wind's freezing blast extinguished every torch and lamp That only the bloody dusk-light illumined Methuselah and his quailing knights, who fled To the furthest extremes of the throne-room. Within the broken portal of the threshold Stood the black and terrible angel-shape of Abaddon. Twice the height of man stood the avenger, Armoured in plate of iron and bronze, His wings spread wide like the torn pennant on the field, Within his hand the bleeding sword, the Ruiner, Seven feet long and shaped like the serpent's tongue With engrailed blade and forked point, Weeping ever the blood of the fallen. Thus came Abaddon to the throne of Methuselah. Even as the raven croaked Methuselah repented not And begged not for clemency before a vision so fearful But in indignation raised his spear against the spirit And shouted his defiance to the Shedim knight: "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 214 \"I am Methuselah, the Destroyer of Men.

All those who have opposed me and denied to me That which my hand would seize Are now naked bone upon the plain. Ten thousand hearts have I emptied of their precious liquor. None is there on Earth or in Heaven who would oppose me. Who then are you that comes to me So eager to die, wracked by death-agony, pierced by my lance?

Did you not think those trophies a warning To those that would come here to destroy me. Surely they have all been themselves destroyed. Who then are you that comes to me? How are you named, dark angel?\" Unmindful of the tyrants boasts, The warrior of Chadel crossed in seven steps The hall and stood before the throne And spoke but these words in reply To the interrogation of Methuselah, merciless king: \"I am Abaddon, the Destroyer.\" Havoc rose and Havoc fell within a blink, Shrieking like an eagle swooping on his pray. Shattering into splinters the spear that Methuselah held, Vainly, against the falling sword of adamant, And the blade went onwards in the downward motion, Cutting in two the tyrant from his shoulder to his loin.

To that gory throne was Lamech heir, Lamech, son of Methuselah, and he ascended To sit where his father had been cut down For the terrible deeds that he had wrought And, as is the way sons, sought to out-strip his father In glory won on the battle's field Though well had he learned to obey the dictates of honour. Strong was Lamech's arm in battle, Well did he cast the spear and hold the shield From his bronze-plated chariot, drawn by maddened bulls. As his father had brought disgrace upon the Nephilim So did Lamech bring honour upon their race. Thither and thither went the columns of Lamech And returned with rich tributes to the king. Tributes though he called them though They were extorted at the spear's point And not all the Shedim were satisfied at his deeds But he was not as his father had been and some lesser evils Must be borne if the greater wrongs must be cast aside. Thus did the kingdom of Lamech become great. In this time UtaNapishtim ruled in bright Shurupuk And Lamech heard of the fame of that great state And, as had princes before him, became jealous of that city. Proud Lamech resolved in his heart that by his hand Would the shining walls of Shurupuk be cast down And by his torch would her towers burn. Thus arrayed in the hides of lion and battle-dress, Ash-shafted spear in his hand and shield upon his arm, Painted bright with the ensign of his line, The six-pointed star, azure upon argent, Did he convoke his thegns before him.

Of all the nation's of the world is Shurupuk the greatest Like an elephant does she go upon the Earth And those who stand against the hosts of Shurupuk Are crushed as though beneath the foot Of a beast so great as an elephant. Yet I, Lamech, am resolved upon this course That I should be conqueror of Shurupuk And win the treasures of that city for myself. The people of Lamech shall be ever remembered As those who ended Shurupuk's greatness And replaced the towers of UtaNapishtim With those higher and more brilliant, More enduring, and upon the ruined stone Of Shurupuk built the foundations of the Nephilim's kingdom That, it is so foretold, shall surpass Chadel and Heaven In majesty and great duration. Let us then rouse our armies to battle To contest the Earth with great Shurupuk That our children shall be the chief of the Nephilim That shall rule the world hereafter. This destiny is ours, let us then seize it And make ourselves as gods upon the Earth.\" To the rash exhortations of Lamech went up a cheer As his knights became roused with greed and glory. Once more was their hot blood heated And their hearts were filled with rage. Resounding hymns to the spirits of battle, The Shedim hunt that fight at the side of worthy men, They gathered up their hosts of war And made ready their horses before the chariots, Then, taking up their spears, went forth to battle, Marching to the tattoo of heart and drum.

Now must you stretch out your arm in wrath And destroy the impudent Lamech Who so rashly contests your realm. The man that has become your foe is rash And, though brave, his hosts are disordered, Aware not of the flag or drum, commanding manoeuvre, And in both size and armoury no equal of our own. Lamech is barbaric, understanding not our strength. Thus do our spies assay and report. Well would it be then if you went forth now against him Before yet greater parts of your empire are laid waste. This you could do with ease if you so willed. This is our report, o noble lord.\" To this strategy did the king nod assent And issue his commandment to march from Shurupuk And quell the invasion of his realm with haste.

Eight feet high stood the king of Shurupuk, He was as a giant upon the Earth, And his eyes burned as if on fire. Thunderous was voice and thunderous his step And in his right hand he bore a mace with an iron-head That had fallen from amongst the stars of the sky; Five feet long was the shaft of that rod, Decorated with gold and smaragds. And the head was an orb of a foot's girth, Bound with the sinews of tigers. Upon his head he wore a high-crested helm of bronze, Decorated in silver with the temple's seal And his breast was defended by the hide of a crocodile, Made strong with scales of steel. Thus arrayed he saddled and harnessed the charger, White like ivory, great in stature, on which he rode to battle. Then, as the horns sounded the mustering of hosts, He ascended the high ziggurat to my shrine To pour upon the Shedim's altar a libation of lion's blood To win the alliance of the Shedim for his campaign. Wide swung the gates of Shurupuk as the armies passed through And it seemed to those that watched from the wall That the ranks of spears were without end And that the gate would disgorge an eternity of warriors And at the van was UtaNapishtim, god amongst men, Beneath standard of the temple's seal, the flaming eye. Upon the western horizon, apparent to the beholders, A column of the black smoke of pillage rose And the wind brought the war-cries and the drums Of the yet distant foes to the walls of Shurupuk. Now Lamech marched also at the column's head And, perceiving in the East the flags upon the towers That made fast the walls of Shurupuk, He urged his army to new speeds, eager to plunder that bright city. Now as the embattled walls of the city appeared to his eyes As he stood at the Euphrates' western bank He paused to read in the patterns of the fire's smoke The portent for the battle that he was to fight."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" 219 Within the shifting fumes that rose One rune alone was seen, 'Calamity!' Dissatisfied with such an augur he doused the flame And, as he made to rekindle the fire in which he read, His army gave up a great shout of dismay As the battalions of Shurupuk marshalled on the farther shore. To every spear of his that pointed eastward Twenty shining glaives pointed westward across the ford And to each horse of his that stamped its hooves Were ten chariots of Shurupuk. And upon the farther bank, diametric to his own position, Upon a steed of white, was the great Nephilim-king That he had thought to oppose. Now the bellow of battle-horns sounded, Commanding the charge of Shurupuk And proclaiming of Lamech, 'Calamity!' Into confusion was the line of Lamech cast As the foremost ranks turned to flee Even as the hindmost advanced ag ainst a foe they perceived not well. In that disorder the sounding of retreat was unheeded And Lamech's people were as gazelle in the lion's jaw. Lamech himself could not draw his gaze from the white stallion And its rider, throwing up a froth, As the dread king came across the river to meet him, The iron sceptre raised high like the tail of the scorpion That has within its claws its prey. All courage then left the heart of Lamech. In the shallows of the river, before the king, UtaNapishtim, Lamech fell upon his knees, Casting aside his spear and holding up open hands. The emperor in green dismounted from his horse And crossed the remainder of the distance by his own feet To stand in triumph before the prostrate Lamech, Raising up once more with two hands The great mace of meteoric iron.

All about fell the army of Lamech, Cut down as if they were a field of wheat, Their broken spears falling like the sheared stalks. Everywhere was there death. Now UtaNapishtim took his turn to speak, Looking in scorn upon the subdued Lamech. With a regal voice he spoke And in anger he intoned these words: \"Kneel not! Thus is it written upon stone. Thus is it written upon the tablets of lapis lazuli. We are men and we do not kneel. Not for this were the Nephilim conceived. You dishonour us both with this submission And I perceive you to be a base creature, Wholly without honour in deed or word. Lamech, you are most shameful in my sight.

You have asked me to spare you And to take as payment the lives of your tribesmen. I shall spare them and take in payment The life of yours that, in shame, Is forfeited by false King Lamech. This is the penalty of the treachery That you would wreak to save yourself. Find then honour in death upon the field of battle. I shall tell none that you died upon your knees.\" Then UtaNapishtim brought down his mace And struck Lamech upon the head And thus bereft him of his life. Thus fell Lamech at the Euphrates. Now UtaNapishtim, king of the Nephilim, Instructed his horns and flags signal a retreat That the thegns of Lamech might sue for peace.

Putting down his great mace he spoke Not thunderously but with magisterial aspect, Wisest and most noble of all kings was he. To the knights he addressed these words: \"I know you to be noble men For you have submitted all to me And placed yourself within my reach To spare the people of your army.

In triumph did UtaNapishtim enter at the gates, Thrown wide to receive his hosts And the vanquished also, bearing their comrades Whose wounds were rudely bound up. To the palace of UtaNapishtim were brought the men of the West Where his physics and magicians tended them And, as the sun went upon the lower passage, Made whole those made unwhole in battle. At dawn UtaNapishtim went forth by day, Leading from his tower the march of victory."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 224 Declaring from the procession's head That no work was for that joyous day But celebration of victory and reconcile with the westerners. Dancers, then, and singers, acrobats and fools, Went out to delight the cheering throngs That resounded loud their general's name That had brought glory again to Shurupuk's high walls; \"UtaNapishtim! UtaNapishtim!\" was the cry And as he went about the streets upon his steed, Leading in his train the armies of bright Shurupuk The happy people of the city cast flowers upon him, Blooms of many colours and fragrances, And brought forth wine and meat to him That he might feast and toast the city. With games was that day of joy celebrated, With wrestling and casting of stone and spear, With race on foot, on horse, or in gay pennoned chariots Each drawn by four stamping horses abreast Made swift by the snapping of the whip As the multitudes exhorted those that won their favour With some display or brave flourish. As the sun set upon the city UtaNapishtim went once more to the height of the ziggurat And there poured out new libations To thank the Shedim for their favour And share with them the people's joy. Raising his voice in the dome of the temple, Standing at the wetted altar, UtaNapishtim and his priests from all sides Hymned their joy and thanks Though they kneeled not in supplication. No king am I over men But in battle I fight at the right hand of the worthy man. Where there is need and worth I have helped my children Not in the way that Adonai Yahweh has claimed, Not condescending from some high place To bestow whimsical mercies upon the Nephilim, But I have guided and protected as is the parent's duty And thus have earned of men the respect due to parents Who so fulfil what is asked of them Though, led astray by Heaven's lies, I have been reviled."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 225 In such a spirit are the libations poured out. So did UtaNapishtim honour the Shedim And the ancient shades of his great ancestors. From a bowl of gold was the wine poured out Upon a great table of marble, Carved from the stone of mountains, Set with grooves to drain what was offered Down into the Earth and to Chadel. As the night grew dark after day The streets were lit with great braziers of steel, Filled with charcoal and incense And even to the rising of the sun Shurupuk was full of merriment And the people of Shurupuk were full of wine and mead. At this time the army of Lamech returned to the gate Whence they had first set forth to conquer, Coming back in defeat and ignominy Though indeed they had fought most bravely. Thus was the body of Lamech borne to his city. Upon a bier of cedar, adorned with beaten gold, Dragged on by the bulls of his chariot, The king was carried to the city's heart And the throng of his people walked behind the pall, Weeping and beating cow-skinned drums. To each side of the pall went his knights, Lances raised in high salute to the fallen king. Through the city's streets was Lamech taken To the catacombs of his line Where lay the kings that had sired him, All, save his father, Methuselah, Who Lamech himself had given to the crows To appease the wrath of Abaddon And win once more to his left hand The terrible angel and the bleeding blade. Now Lamech himself lay dead And all his people bewailed his fate As he passed them upon the streets, Laid out in splendid garb, robes of gold, With ash-staved spear and shield painted with his crest, And helmet of bronze hiding from the sight of men The ruinous fissure in his skull,"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 226 Broken by the fall of that fatal mace. Ten thousand voices acclaimed the king As the hero of his race For they knew not of his perfidy upon the field And indeed much that his hand wrought was good And, in life, his the greater part of his action Had been noble in intent and conclusion. Gladly did I recall his spirit to me. As the people mourned the fallen king His body was brought into the tomb And laid out in a rich sarcophagus, Carved of red quartz and made bright By twenty rubies of most worthy size And a thousand studs of amber In which the eye descried others entombed As now Lamech was entombed within the Earth, Ancient beastlings of ancient days Caught within the glassy sepulchre. When the body had been anointed with precious oils To preserve the noble flesh from death's corruption And rightful libations had been poured out To honour the spirit of the monarch Then the tomb was sealed once more And drum-beating wizards chased demons from the door. Thus was the manner of Lamech's homecoming. Now caravans were sent forth from the city's gates To bear to far Shurupuk a wealth of riches By which to by the favour of the new king And thus honour the mercy he had shown To the armies that he had vanquished. A hundred mules bearing on their backs Grain and wine, gold and silver And the hides of beasts. Thus was the kindness of UtaNapishtim so repaid. From the tower of the barbican That guarded the gates of the city, The son of Lamech watched the tribute-bringers go Far from the city walls with the riches of his treasury To bestow upon a foreign land That which his father's spear had one. For this wept Noah, son of Lamech"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 227 And spoke thus, looking back into the city And upon the barrow-gate, now sealed By the hands of his father's knights Where Lamech's bones now joined Those of Noah's noble ancestors: \"So to this is my kingdom come. How great is this shame and ignominy That my once noble line is brought low By the thousand enemies that surround my walls. Once was the line of Methuselah feared by men Now, hearing of those names, they jeer and jest For all honour is stolen from me, Taken as the spoils upon the field of defeat. Such injustice is brought upon my shoulders That I must bear such humiliations. So do my enemies gather like hyenas To laugh and wait for my arm too to fail That they might pick the bones of my kingdom clean. O accursed is the line of Methuselah! And accursed shall be those that brought it low. Ever was my grandfather faithful in libation To warlike Abaddon the Destroyer, Pouring out bottomless libations to that angel Whose shadow falls like smoke upon the battle's field. Ever did he consecrate his thousand glories to Abaddon That he won by his spear's point in battle Upon the open field or in escalade Against the walls of some city that would defy our noble line. How I mourn these lost days? Not grateful for Methuselah's devotion was Abaddon And not with favour did he repay the king's homage. Rather he came as a lion upon his servant And even before such a terror, Was Methuselah ever defiant and strong, Demonstrating those very qualities that the Shedim Would themselves boast and advance. Thus Abaddon struck down Methuselah And showed the mettle of the Shedim's vows. Now UtaNapishtim has struck down my father, He that is the favourite of Chadel,"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 228 High Shurupuk's king, and thus do they again betray The ancestors of Noah, those dwellers in darkness, And deliver my kingdom to the thrall Of those they would love above me. Mightiest in battle was great Lamech. How then could those soft people of Shurupuk Have slain him in the fray When his spear is sharp and his arm is strong. Again do I perceive the art of Satan And it does work against me. The Shedim blunted the barb of my father's spear And made weak his arm with enchantments. Thus do the people of Chadel conspire with men To accomplish the ruin of Noah. For these thousand perfidies against me I do revile the inconstant Shedim And, without their aid, shall Noah find prosperity For they have availed me not. Hear me then in deep Chadel, Satan, Noah does stand as your adversary And I shall oppose you and those you love With all the strength that I have And undo all your deeds on Earth. Hear thus the will of Noah.\" So was Noah seduced by hatred For all that he had lost that he would hold And did curse me for his troubles Though I caused them not. As the caravan was lost to Noah's sight A voice behind him rang out, Beautiful and bright, like the trumpet Yet endowed with most august majesty. Turning he perceived, arrayed in robes of white, Resplendent in a crown of gold Chief of all the Elohim, Michael. Thus did the prince of Heaven achieve by fortune That which was won not by device. Thus spoke perfidious Michael, once my brother: \"O Noah, son of Lamech,"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 229 Do you think that the children of Heaven Are deaf to the cries of the wronged? Does it seem to you that Adonai Yahweh Cares not for the race of men on Earth? Surely He is most merciful to those That would but accept His kingship And it is a most rightful claim. Yet mankind have been beguiled by Satan's lies And acknowledge not the kingship of my Lord. Thus does wickedness prosper on the Earth And Satan is pleased with his evil For all purity and righteousness fade And the world is devoured by his darkness. By his tongue are men turned to corruption And heed not the laws that Adonai Yahweh has laid down As a guide to the men made by His hand From a sod of clay. Instead they are stirred to rebellion Against the noble King of Heaven. Thus are the people of Adonai Yahweh Stolen from the rightful Lord over them. All that is good does Satan hate, Seeking only to make vile what was once bright And so spoil the Creation of God. Thus does he go upon the Earth And opposes Him that was once his Lord. What he cannot win to his villainy he destroys. In your heart, son of Lamech, is much light That shines out, banishing all evil. Not all the deceptions of the Shedim can assail your soul But your virtue burns like a torch And itself reaches out in piety To assail the walls of Chadel. No Shedim device may conquer one so pure as you So that which they may not win They reach out to destroy and ruin, Breaking with despair and ten thousand woes Saintly Noah, enemy of their evil. For this do the Shedim conspire against you, Strengthening your foes' arms and stealing The strength of your own forces."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 230 By their malice does the might of Babylon, Den of all sin, wax great against you And thus are you cast into the power Of those villains that Satan favours.

Yet if you would but kneel to God And pledge your soul to his service Then surely would His intervention come For so long as one good man lives upon the Earth Then Adonai Yahweh shall be powerful over Satan. Kneel then before Adonai Yahweh, Lord, And become His instrument upon the Earth. You shall become a scourge against the wicked And your arm shall be strengthened against the transgressors. By you shall Adonai Yahweh purge Creation Of all that is most villainous and base And thus shall the world be restored To the grace before the coming of Satan.\" Hearing these words of Michael The bitter heart of Noah was won. How ready men are to believe false witness Against those that they already malign. Once again did Michael turn hearts against me With his liar's tongue and voice. Before the angel Michael Noah went upon his knees And touched upon the floor his forehead, Abasing himself before worthless God. Now seeing that his work was done Michael smiled and rose once more Towards Heaven upon bright wings, Speaking to Noah this final instruction as he departed: \"Await me, Noah, for I shall return With instruction from your new king. In the perfect law of God you shall be schooled And, obeying those laws that I shall teach you, You shall grow bright in the eyes of God"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 231 Who is most kind to those that would please him, Bestowing upon them a thousand gifts And soothing ten thousand sufferings.

Await then the return of Michael, Faithfully, without doubt in your soul. Return I shall with the word of God.\" Thus went Michael upon his return to Heaven, Upon beating wings of blazing gold, His fading light becoming as a star in the sky Then first fading and then blinking away. All this did Noah watch in silence Then, yet unspeaking, returned to the city. Going to his house, appointed to befit a prince, Its cedar gate the height of two men. Passing then into that palace that for him His great father had ordered built And into the central hall, draped with coloured cloth And painted with a myriad of rainbow hues. The household servants bowed low before the lord And bade him welcome to his house. Yet when before such attentions had been pleasing to him Now he perceived, distracted as he was, Only mockery in their reverence And with scornful words banished them from his presence. Now he went to his sons and consorts Where they revelled in a courtyard Set around a silver pool with darting fish, Drinking wine and feasting on many meats, Dancing to the music played by lutesmen, Hidden from sight by crimson veils, Conjuring phantom music that serenaded the heart With distant beauty, like a dream. Now was Noah seized up by a rage And he went amongst his family, casting Wine and meats into the water, to the fishes"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 232 Who dined well upon that night. Screaming in his wrath, Noah reprimanded Those who caroused in that courtyard As was the custom of their family. Noah now seized up a rod to his right hand And, tearing away the drapes, Beat from his home those who played sweet music. Now again he spoke to his sons and consorts In a voice trembling with anger, Overcome by grief and bitterness At his kingdom and his father's fall: \"O my sons, my wives, what infamy is this? Having just returned from the gates, Where I have seen my kingdom taken from me, Borne upon the backs of mules the treasures That once filled the chests of Lamech, I come to perceive this in my own house. My family sunk in such debauchery as this. Let me tell you what transpired at the gate. As I watched in sorrow and despair The tribute that we sent to distant Shurupuk Carried from me in a caravan, bedecked in purple, The Elohim Michael came to me there And told me well the truth of things Where before was I blinded by wickedness. Let me tell you what was taught to me. The Earth is full of wicked men, Beguiled by the words of villainous Satan. Their evil deeds make tainted more and more The original perfect Creation of God. Yet because of the wickedness of men And their love for the apostate Satan The merciful power of God wanes upon the Earth And depravity prospers uncastigated. Thus is the entire human race soiled by sin And their wickedness waxes ever greater To eclipse all that is good upon Earth. Yet God in high Heaven would strike against such wickedness If He but possessed the means. But Satan is no monarch of the Earth"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 233 And, hitherto, God had no instrument of His will. Satan hates all that is noble and pure In the Creation of God and would destroy it, Seducing all to his own baseness. Because my own life has been pure and upright Satan now seeks my ruin, fearing me And reviling my more virtuous nature. For this reason is calamity upon calamity heaped on And my back bent over with my burdens. Yet perceiving from His throne in Heaven, The nobility of my soul, God has sent His messenger, Michael, to bring me tidings of the good news. As the noblest of the men on Earth I have been chosen as God's agent here To work His will against the transgressors And bring a terrible judgement upon them. For this reason has Satan sought my ruin. Now, anointed for this great task, I return to the household that is my own To discover those very crimes that I am used against. What disgrace is wrought upon me That my own family is guilty of that which God despises! There shall be no more of such sin In the house of Noah, man of Adonai Yahweh. Now you must all make yourselves humble before God. Kneel and he shall forgive you all Despite your thousand faults and flaws. God is most merciful, oft-forgiving, And his chastisement to terrible to those that trangress.\" Hearing the words of Noah The concubines and sons of the prince Were dismayed at what he said But the foolish prince had chosen for himself Consorts of weak-will, easily dominated By his own jealous authority And had raised those children of his To regard well what he desired. Thus did he build false strength for himself And succour well his pride.

As the sun rose above the hills in the East, Cupric Venus going before, burning brighter than Sirius, As the night passed away as the new day Was inaugurated in the red dawn-light, Noah went with his wives and sons Into the desert beyond the city-walls And there prayed to lofty Heaven And knelt in abasement more worthy of beasts To the throne of Adonai Yahweh. Thus did he await the Elohim, Michael, With his family, giving them over to Heaven As beasts at the market-place. All day did they wait and pray For some vision of the prince of Heaven Who had vowed to meet with Noah And instruct him in the law of God, That mankind might be bound also To the will of him eluded by the Shedim. Nephilim and Shedim shall kneel no more But go as proud gods upon the Earth. As all this had passed upon the Earth So had the happenings in Heaven been consequential. Flying swift from the Earth to Heaven And passing there straight to the heart, Going on swift wings to the Eternal Tower And the sundered throne of God, Awaiting not the herald's call But going direct into the presence of God And then, making himself low, In supplication that had long ago become a deed Without soul or meaning to the Elohim. None feared now the strength of Adonai Yahweh But rather sought to buy with false respect The favour of their father that they might, With some arbitrary right, command The actions of their brothers And not be commanded by them That played the intrigues of Heaven.

It is of Noah, son of Lamech, Of whom the words of Michael tell Who, with his own voice, cursed the accursed one And reviled the deeds of Shedim.

Yet for these things he cannot blame his own blood But must rather seek another to bear that burden. Thus he his easily won to our cause. Hearing then his prosecution Against the dwellers in Chadel As I kept my own vigil o'er the Earth I hastened to him to thus inform Him of an alliance between himself and Heaven, Telling him that he was right indeed To make such allegation against Satan. Explained to him did I That the root of all sorrow Heaped upon his low-bent back Was the wickedness of the Nephilim, Following the strictures of our foe. Yet, I taught him so, That if Adonai Yahweh might win a tool, One good man, upon the Earth Then all evil might be conquered And the thousand imagined crimes against Noah Would know seven-fold vengeance. Heeding my teachings gladly did he submit To the will of high Heaven And willingly became the agent Of the potent wrath of Heaven. Thus my Father I offer to You This mortal son of Satan as a gift, Won by my own ingenuity. How then must Noah be used, Now that he is in our power? Surely such a boon must not be squandered.

Then he rose once more and adverted His eyes once more to the throne of God. Now, upon the ancient Archon's face, Was writ a smile where all had been woe. For in this gift of fortune he perceived a way By which he might yet prevail And thwart my plans and fate, Yet preserving his dominion over all Though little did he deserve such an end. O forever curse the name of Noah Who made open such a path to Heaven That such butchery might be done.

As the red light of dawn awakened Noah and his people from their sleep, Hunger ravened at their bellies For they had not consumed meat Since they had first gone from the city.

Will you then make yourself humble, Kneeling in prostration before the Lord Who is most terrible in ire And most generous in His favours. Spurn not the words of Noah, They are as a plain warning to you And you shall not be warned again.\" Thus were the people of Lamech Moved to great laughter by Noah's words, Deriding the speech of an idiot Who had been most sorely led from truth To speak such words of madness. Mocking and jeering, they addressed the prince, With these words of scorn: \"Maddened by grief is Noah At his father's death and his kingdom's loss At the defeat by Shurupuk And the more worthy monarch, UtaNapishtim, a god amongst men, That he should seek to kneel Before this invisible king of his. Must he invent a lord for UtaNapishtim To restore once an equilibrium That only one as weak as Noah would desire. What madness has come upon him That he should kneel to Heaven For man kneels to none and not the Elohim For we are greater than that ruined domain And are destined to conquer the sons of God. Is it the way of the victor To go down before the vanquished? How deluded by deceit is Noah That he should consider such a thing. O doubly mourned is Lamech That his son is so weak That he is prostrate before Heaven!

Noah and his family thus Were exiled to the desert Of the blowing sands and burning sun. Scorpions and jackals served Were they had once servants and acrobats. Such ordeal though but tempered The madness in Noah's mind And he raged again and again Against those that had so ruined him Though in truth but one had ruined him And the name of him was Noah. Falling down upon his knees Upon the desert's sands, Noah prayed: \"Praise be to Adonai Yahweh, Lord of what has been created, The Benevolent, The Merciful, The Judge of the Sins of Men. You alone do I worship, Your help alone do I seek. Guide me then upon the true road, That path You have decreed for the faithful Rather than those that do offend You And those that have wandered far. Hear me now when I am most needy"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 248 Your faithful servant, Noah. What am I to do upon this road? It is a road for the beasts of the desert And not for men and angels. I am cast into exile For speaking against that which should itself Be banished from the nations of men. Ever have I served Your instruction Warning those that have transgressed Against those laws that You have set down. Yet with this terrible recompense am I served. O most wicked are the men of the Earth And richly do they deserve Your wrath. O Lord, King of Heaven and Earth, I do beg You to visit upon them That have so accomplished my ruin A most awful vengeance. They that do so treat the ambassador Must surely invite the wrath of the King And I have been but an ambassador, Conveying to them Your will. Once more do I implore You Avenge Your servant.\" As he lay prostrate upon the sands Noah wept and raged And so called out to Heaven. Then appearing, as if resolved from the wind, His dark shadow falling over Noah, Blasted by the fire of the sun, Michael came to his instrument To succour him with gentle words And yet nurture those desires in him That were expedient to Heaven's cause. Arrayed in robes of white was he, Michael, prince of the Elohim, And bound into braids with gold Was his silvered beard and hair. Arrayed like a king was Michael And with a tyrant's voice he spoke, Tutoring the fallen one in what must be done"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" 249 To fulfil that plan that Heaven had For Noah and his family in their long war, Hopeless, against Chadel and the children, Against the tribe of kings foretold, Against the Nephilim who would one day rule That which would be lost to Heaven.

Does it seem to you that Adonai Yahweh Cares not for the race of men on Earth? Surely He is most merciful to those That would but accept His kingship And it is a most rightful claim. Yet mankind have been beguiled by Satan's lies And acknowledge not the kingship of my Lord. Thus does wickedness prosper on the Earth And Satan is pleased with his evil For all purity and righteousness fade And the world is devoured by his darkness. By his tongue are men turned to corruption And heed not the laws that Adonai Yahweh has laid down As a guide to the men made by His hand From a sod of clay. And what is wrought by His hand May yet be undone if you would hear. Noah, you shall be avenged And now pay heed how it shall be. Adonai Yahweh has resolved to destroy All things that live upon the Earth That do take breath from the wind Save those that He does choose to spare. Lo! The Lord of Hosts shall throw open The cataracts and release upon the Earth A great Deluge, drowning all the land Beneath the swollen seas.

Into this great vessel you shall install All your family that they might escape the waters And two of each kind of beast that goes on Earth That the produce of God's creation be not lost. When such a ship is built and stocked Then shall we recite the incantation By which the waters be convoked. Thus Noah are you avenged. Thus is the dictate of your King And not with ease does He suffer your shame But does reach out in wrath And destroy those that would sin against Him. Make your prostrations doubly then Lest you invite the ire of God And with triple swiftness Make firm that which He wills of you.\" So did Noah hear the word of Michael, Spoken in the secret places of the desert, And set to work his household To build a ship of those dimensions That the Elohim prince had specified to him. Yet not Noah alone heard Michael's words For upon a spire of rock close to that place Where Michael had disclosed the plan, Determined by his inclement lord, Watched the silver crane, Ashmedai, Who had followed Noah since his banishment"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" 251 From the city where he had revealed His new allegiance and been mocked By the more knowing people of his father. Hearing all, Ashmedai, with keen ears, Came to know of the Elohim's design And the fate they had in mind For the Nephilim that I sired. Thus had they sought to win That which had been lost to them. Now the Shedim herald hastened Swift to most deep Chadel Of the fount of flame To relay to his brethren the witness Of Heaven's intent towards the Earth. Flying like a falling star That goes like a bolt of fire With a tail of light across the sky, Went Ashmedai amongst the numberless columns Of stone that held aloft the soaring vaults Carved into the living stone of Earth. As precipitous as an arrow let fly From the singing bow-string, Went Ashmedai amongst the passages, Torn out by the talons of dragons. So came Ashmedai to Chadel. To receive the Shedim thegn The gates, bound with iron, were set open And he passed inwards. With no less haste he made A path to the Spire of Opal and Ruby And came before me in great distraction, Panting with ardour of his flight. In this way I learnt of what was planned By Heaven for the race of man. Upon a seat of cedar I sat, Draped with silks of purple and cinnabar, And sipped from jewel-starred cup A rich nectar brewed from grapes Grown upon the shadowed vines of the underworld, Potent with prophecy and sleep.

Both bowed to greet the other, Making plain the mutual admiration That each for the other held. Seeing that he was yet weary, Unrestored after that headlong mission That had brought him to me I offered him a share of that wine I drank, Pouring out for him a goblet Of the sweet and perfumed liquor That flowed like the very sap of rubies. \"Drink, my friend,\" I counselled, \"For you seem exhausted by some travail. Dear Ashmedai, drink of this fine dew And you shall find it most regenerative. Myself, I am now quite overcome By its more exotic properties, Finding it some degrees more potent Than other wines that have met my lips. It does set strange fancies to dance Before my eyes though they be not there And makes each colour that I gaze upon A thousand times more distinct Than it seemed to me before. Drink and restore yourself And then tell me what it is That has to such haste spurred you. I had thought that you were upon the Earth, Keeping watch upon Lamech's foolish son Who, it would seem, has gone quite mad And raved himself from his home and city. What is it that Noah has done That has so excited you? What is there to report of his deeds That is of such urgent consequence"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" 253 That you have sought me out with such alacrity?

Drink Ashmedai and recover That you might make report And make known what dire intelligence Has roused to such alarm The dauntless Shedim champion, Ashmedai. What have your eyes perceived To so dim them and, at once, Set them aflame with a nervous spark.\" Ashmedai with a flattened palm Pushed away the proffered chalice And instead regarded me With impatient and excited eyes, Dancing this way and that. Now he spoke, each word Jumping over the prior, Spilling from his tongue like a cascade That babbled on a rapid flow In his haste to convey what had passed. So reported Ashmedai: \"Lord Satan, Commander of Our Hearts, Most dire news have I flown with From the surface Earth Where I had watched beguiled Noah, Bearing witness to what he wrought Lest Heaven use him for some plan against us Which I now perceive they do. Yet I have learnt of what they conceive, The Elohim, in their cruel kingdom, And how they shall use their pawn."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 254 O perfidious ones! How I revile you For the awful butcheries you devise Against the noble Nephilim, Turning a brother's hand in vengeance Against they who are of one race. As I kept my watch upon Noah From some little distance, Watching his miserable supplication And demented cries for revenge Against those that had cast him out To live amongst jackals and scorpions, I did perceive treacherous Michael, Arch-deceiver, descend to the prince, Whose ravings have stripped him of princedom. Noah, before our once-brother, knelt, Praying to Adonai Yahweh, foe of man. After it had seemed to Michael That his slave had fawned for good time He spoke to him, promising To ensnare to his most wrongful cause The prince that knelt before him, So criminal was his purpose. Then, to Noah and, unknowing, To secret Ashmedai, he divulged The true purpose Heaven had for Lamech's son. This, Satan, do they ordain: In Noah is invested some part of power That was lost to Adonai Yahweh When you took it from him upon the field. This power then Heaven can but command If the Elohim can command the Nephilim To the end Noah does suffice. Using then that power which does reside in him They will call upon the Earth A great flood to cover mountain peaks, Drowning all upon the Earth Save that which has fore-warning. Michael has instructed Noah to build for him a boat To carry God's loyal family from the waters And of every beast that goes on land A pair by which to breed anew"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" 255 Their population upon the blasted Earth.

For you shall be total destruction I shall not spare so much as an atom of your being No matter what entreaties you might make. By this action you do condemn yourself And the very motion of the Universe Does strengthen my arm against you.\" Now sobriety held me absolutely And all dregs of stupor went from me As I pondered the intelligence brought to me And wished most fervently that I but dreamt. My mind would not believe That even the treacherous Elohim Who had so wronged me in times past Would commit such an atrocity As that which Ashmedai had reported. Blank incomprehension was the one defence Of the shocked wit to such knowledge And I was fully numbed by this. I fell back into my seat, trembling. I covered my face and wept. No power had I to avert this calamity And so spare my children The cruel purpose of the Elohim And the abomination they sought to bring.

All my dreams were drowned beneath the waves, Raised up by the malfeasance of Heaven. In that dark hour all seemed lost to me And I would that the darkness upon my soul Would swell and swallow completely My sense and bear me off to witless rest, Unknowing of all things and my defeat At hated Heaven's hands. All was dark to Satan's eyes When all had once seemed won. Yet in darkness there was a light And it caught fast upon the pitch of despondency And set my soul ablaze. When I had been made weak by sorrow In an instant was I animated by delirium, Knowing in that instant that to lie prostrate Even when all was lost Is an act of shame. Even unto the final drawing of breath Do the noble fight on. To live without hope Is indeed to die. Thus was I seized by new vigour And caught up in a frenzy. Going forth from that my high tower To stand atop its embattled height I cried out to the city, Rousing Chadel's people from slumber And stirring them to attention.

Thus gathered to me were the Shedim And so did they hear me speak: \"Noble Shedim, hear me. Once again must we bear arms against Heaven And thwart what they desire. You know that Noah, Lamech's son, Is the Elohim's and serves them. This tool have they found some use for, Employing that power invested in the Nephilim To work against them, through Noah, A most abhorrent end. It is the intention of Heaven's sons To release upon the Earth The waters held up in hidden reservoirs And raise the seas that they cover The highest mountains' peaks And drown beneath the waves All living things that go upon the Earth. Thus will they slay my children, All, with a single blow, Save the family of Noah Who shall be employed to breed A subservient race of men, Unresisting of their will. Against this end must we work And swiftly for their crime already moves, Gaining impetus to its conclusion.

This fleet of our own we shall defend Against those hosts that Heaven sends To consummate their villainy And make good the slaughter. Shedim and Nephilim shall stand as one Against the Elohim and tax a harsh due In blood for this great wrong. Thus, sisters, brothers, make ready for battle Though we have known already a surfeit of it. Some third of your number must go to Earth To defend the Nephilim that can be saved And the remainder must guard these walls Against those that would come against us From Heaven when we are weak, Guarding distant places. The guardian host, defenders of the Nephilim, Shall be led jointly by Moloch and Ishtar, Let the former's burning wrath Be tempered by the unflinching protector Of the child-race whom she gave life. I go now to Shurupuk to prepare the fleet, Giving to UtaNapishtim, noblest of men, Instruction of that which must be done. Make the proper preparations in my absence. Now I must go with haste For there is little time to me And mush must be done Before the seas rise up from their rightful place And devour, with unebbing tide, The shores and plains and hills, Wiping clean the Earth of that which lives, Drawing breath from the wind.

No such defilement would make fall those walls But the sea itself would wash away All that was fine and noble of those streets and domes Like walls of sand upon the shore, Erased by the ebb and flow of tides. Robed in shadow, I passed the sentries at the gates, Flying upon rainbow wings above the towers, Eluding every eye that strained To perceive the invader's host cast up A great column of dust from the desert Whether in the East or West. Then, descending, I went unseen by the streets, Paved with carved stone and broad That six chariots could pass abreast. Filled with merchants and musicians were those roads, Acrobats danced and for some piece of silver The seers would tell you of tomorrow's promise Though they told nor saw what came And, by merciful blindness, were spared That knowledge that weighed heavy on my heart. At the city's centre rose high the ziggurat Upon the pinnacle of which was built The temple were libations were poured out To flow through soil and stone to the founts of Chadel.

Thus came I to the southern temple gate. The height of three men were the double doors That closed the portal and cut from cedar, Made bright with designs of gold, Wreaths and vines, heavy with a thousand fruits. Above was the temple's seal, painted onto ebony: Within a pentagram with two exalted horns, An eye painted in an emerald hue that stood As a symbol of that first wisdom that I conceived, Fore-seeing Heaven's fall and the rise Of the new empire that would be greater yet Than the ancient realm that it conquered. From the chief of the eye issued fire, Painted in red and gold, three tongues of flame, One greater and one lesser and a median One within the other, greatest outermost, Each coming to three cusps, the central highest. And from the base fell a tear of blood, Representative of that blood spilt That the Nephilim race might then be born, Shaped of my liver-flesh cut from my frame. Flanked by two horned beasts was the sigil, guarded. Upon its right a she-manticore, carved of red stone, Standing for Ishtar and upon the left flank Sat a weir-wolf of sable rock, for Baalzebub, Twin demiurges in the first crafting of the race. Each sat upon its haunches looking outward Down the steps that led up to the gates. Throwing open the gates I passed inward Where UtaNapishtim stood within, Having entered from the northern portal, Before the altar with a bowl of wine, Pouring out in sacrifice to Ishtar That the year's harvest might be most copious.

Dressed in green robes was UtaNapishtim And at his belt hung that great mace That had broken open Lamech's skull upon the battle's field. Tied into braids were his beard and long hair And his eyes flashed with fire. I bowed low before the king of men As he had bowed before the altar. With a regal voice he intoned And questioned me and my presence there: \"Who are you that comes here, strange one, Though you seem familiar to my mind. You seem to me to possess every attribute of my lord, Him that I followed most dutifully, Knowing well his teaching to men to be wise. Are you then Satanael, maker of the race of man, The parent of the noble Nephilim Of whom I would declare my own lineage? Or are you else a glamour to beguile my wits Sent by Heaven to delude the king That is their great foe and whose kingdom Does grow to rival theirs and cast them down As it has been prophesied by that very Satan With whose seeming you do appear? Speak then to me I do command you, Name yourself, horned angel.\" To these inquiries did I reply, Speaking, myself, with a majestic voice, Clear and strident, that UtaNapishtim Would not mistake the identity of he that addressed And so disregard that urgent warning That I now delivered to him that he might act And so save both himself and others And those ambitions that I held for my children As well as those that they held themselves.

To this end have I hastened to the Earth And to Shurupuk which is your kingdom Though ere long it be lost entirely to you And all else besides if you would heed not my counsel. Yet you are wise and will not disregard The wisdom of others in pride As other less worthy monarchs might do. For this reason have I come to you And not to another less suited to my purpose. You must learn of what the Elohim intend And their dreadful plot against Nephilim, Race of my blood and flesh, vessels of my hope. Adonai Yahweh, upon his broken throne, Has looked down from his crumbling tower, That which is called Eternal but is temporal, And grows fearful of my children's maturation. Fearing for that which is truly lost to him Even before it is taken from him, Adonai Yahweh seeks the de struction of the Nephilim Else to break them for his halter. Yet the dauntless spirit of my children Breaks not easily by any small means. Some grander plan is needed by Heaven To overcome that which is predestined to themselves Cast down the Elohim and seize from them That which they prove unfit to hold. So baser means do the Elohim employ Against those that they would destroy. Upon the end of all Nephilim Are their depraved intents resolved.

His beard seemed possessed with lightning And his flesh glowed red with rage As iron tempered in the forge. Now the monarch raged with lion's voice That shook the very stone of the temple And made tremble the hearts of men and beasts. Even I, brave Satan, who denied the voice of God, Flinched from that ire that, there being none other, Was turned upon me though I earned it not. \"Lord Satanael,\" he roared like a bear enraged, \"Your worthy lips, speaking only wisdom, Are the vessel of these most hated tidings.

This is no honourable act but shameful Most extremely and is not to be pursued. I will act upon that knowledge that you grant me For foolish is the king that ignores such intelligence But whilst their is yet one of my people That might live in my place, Going upon the ships prepared To carry our breathing frames from the waves' embrace, Then that one shall one shall go in my place And UtaNapishtim shall die beneath the water.

Now I knew that there was one amongst them That I had made that pursued the noble way In the darkest shadows. Yet that one such as this should be lost To Heaven's cruel jealousy and others That lived in all places of the Earth Was a most bitter draught to my lips And this one at least I sought to save.

High were their masts, of cedar, And painted with dragon faces were the prows. The white sails, filled with wind, Bore bright the temple's seal And the hulls were made splendid with gold. Beneath the waters brazen beaks Reflected sunlight and broke the skin Of the waves into white froth And yearned to shatter the timbers of the foe.

Unknowing of that which passed in Shurupuk Noah laboured long days and nights To complete that ship that he was commanded. A great vessel was it that he joined in the desert And Elohim-aided first the keel Then high ribs, fleshed with tarred planks, Were constructed and fixed with nails of steel. Like some great and black wasp it grew Beneath the searing sun of day And chill stars of the desert night. Noah became as some shade, Scarce remembering to eat or sleep Whilst he laboured to complete his task And avenge himself upon those that he accused. Filthy and long was his black hair And his flesh was gaunt and pale. His eyes sunk within his head, Giving him the aspect of a skull And the cruel day sky burnt from him his wits That all the while he worked he addressed Commands and exhortations to slaves That lived but within his mind. Thus was built the ship of Noah. When its dark form was finished, Casting a great shadow on the sands As the day died bloody in the West Came Michael to Noah from the South And behind him was some great number of beasts Of each kind a male and female, Lions, serpents, birds and deer, And unnumbered others that went on the Earth And from the wind drew breath. So came Michael once more to Noah To fulfil his black scheme and thwart That scheme of mine which was born Of his own treachery and malice"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 269 That had not dwindled but grown darker yet. \"Hail Noah, son of Lamech,\" Spoke the prince of Heaven. \"This number of beasts have I brought to you That you might gather them And bring them to the ship you built. Now that it is prepared There is no reason to make further delay But to equip the ship and load up The beasts to their cells. We can thus bring about the Deluge more swiftly And for a briefer period Will the creation of God be compelled To bear the burden of mankind's sin. Make haste then Noah to load up your boat And tell your family to prepare to sail Though the desert sands be all about So that the rains might be summoned soon And the sin of man be washed from the Earth Thus defeating Satan and evil crew. Though you are wearied by those toils That your hand has already made complete Spurn not yet greater industry now When it is most necessary And its reward is both near and great. Make preparations for the voyage And then I shall teach to you Those incantations that you must know To summon from the sky and depths The waters to raise up the flood. The keys to the great cataracts shall be taught To you once the ship is ready So make haste that God's will Be not thwarted for a longer time Than must be for it to be accomplished. Act now, Noah, and find vengeance That you so earnestly desire.\" Did that mad criminal need such words as these? No! His heart was so black with hate,"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 Flowing in his blood like a burning venom, That no words of Elohim tongue were there That would spur the flagitious one To crimes that his mind did not itself conceive of. All those born of Man and Woman Are the noble children of Satan. Let it be recorded that base Noah Is no more of the Nephilim Than Satan is of the Elohim. Before had even Michael finished his speaking Noah had even then begun the loading of the beasts Into that black boat built for Heaven's purpose And had instructed his weary family To make ready for the voyage. All night and day laboured Noah And for another night before all was done And all preparations had been made against the flood. Now came Michael to Noah at dawn, Perceiving now had come the time to act And bring forth the waters to cover the Earth. \"Noah, son of Lamech,\" he spoke, \"Now has the time come to intone Those incantations to open the doors By which are bound the sky's cataracts And the waters of the deep Earth. Speak then the words with me And enact the rightful rituals That these jaws might gape open And spew out the contents of their bellies. Thus shall we wash for all time The wickedness of man from the Earth And for all time hereafter Shall the just reign of Adonai Yahweh endure And you shall be His most favoured servant. Rightful victory is now yours, Noah, For you have withstood adversity, Keeping faith when all were arrayed against you. God does reward such servants as you Most amply of His generosity.

From the dawn unto the dusk They sang discordantly the syllables That convoked the waters of Heaven and Earth. As that remorseless bore on And the sun traversed the azure dome Upon its appointed path unto the West The sky became black with clouds And all was in shadow on the land. Now shrieked the wind amongst the trees, Tearing from them leaves and wood And everywhere both man and beast Sought shelter from the coming rains. As the sun descended to die once more In the western sky it was seen not Save for the crimson staining of the fatal clouds. And the rains fell and ceased not. Marvelled did they of Shurupuk's fleet At the unceasing rain that fell Throughout the night upon the ships. So heavy was the air with water That the men of Shurupuk that sailed Upon those ships spared Heaven's wrath Thought that they were already beneath the waves And that those that forsook the shelter Of the inner parts of the ships Were struck to the floor by the weight of rain. Moon and stars illumined not that first night But the fleet was cast into utter darkness For those torches lighted to drive back the shadows"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 272 Were extinguished by the storm. Even as the dawn was marked Scarcely was that black veil lifted For the clouds heavy with great burden Permitted not the rays of the sun To fall upon the lands or seas. Despite the wind that lashed And the rain that beat as a rod upon the back I stood with UtaNapishtim at the bow And watched what Noah's hand had wrought And none saw my tears for the rain. Came to us there the admiral of the fleet To speak with the king of Shurupuk And voice his fear at the tempest That cast the ships hither-thither And made most burdensome the sails with water. \"Mighty King, Lord of Shurupuk, How my heart is made weak with fear That this rain falls so heavy and so long. Not I alone but all those that go upon this voyage That has no destination that you have spoken. This tumult does most harshly assail And casts into disarray the fleet. Now even were there some harbour that you sought It is lost to you and out of reach. Even the greatest exertions of our sailor Can do naught but preserve the vessels And to do more than this is beyond the greatest magicians. Fortunate are we indeed that even now We have lost not a man to the frothing waves. Surely some beneficent sorcery does guard us. O will these rains be ever unabating And grow ever greater in their intensity That every land of man is consumed By the rising waters of the seas, Glutted upon this surfeit? When shall there be respite for us? What has stirred to such a passion The very elements that this should be? Lord, I fear and beg some word of you"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 273 That might grant to me some comfort And make more courageous my coward heart.\" For a long while did the king regard His admiral, faithful yet afraid At the savagery of Noah's sorcery. No words could he conceive of for him To make easy the heart that beat unsoundly For he had no thought to make sure his own With greater knowledge than the other. \"Faithful captain,\" spoke UtaNapishtim, \"Did you but know what you prophesied And had that intelligence which is granted me. Truly this rain shall not cease Until the seas have risen so high That the pinnacles of mountains are sunk deep And the mourning for those that are lost In greater numbers than can be conceived Is truly ceaseless but without end. Never shall this memory be lost. I have told you this for it can no longer be concealed And that first purpose for which I deceived Is no longer served by silence. I sought to spare you some time That dreadful burden that hitherto I have borne alone but for the Shedim. Know also that we of all men Enjoy the protection of Chadel's people And must have no fear of the rains But must prepare for a greater threat That shall come against us surely Before the seas and rains recede once more And yield some welcome shore to us. It is the Elohim that conjure against us This tempest that rages about us, Seeking to so extinguish from the Earth All men that might one day oppose them And cast down their doomed kingdom. When they realise that we have escaped And shall sow anew the seeds of our empire"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 274 That once more the Nephilim's star Climbs ascendant in the sky Then shall they seek to accomplish by other means That which by their first recourse was thwarted. Thus must we prepare, even in the storm's midst, To repel the very hosts of Heaven. It is well then that there is no navigation That our hands can accomplish For it would but blind us to a greater threat. Nephilim and Shedim shall stand side by side To preserve this little part when all else is lost. Make ready for the battle For its time is soon, I know it.\" Thus, without recourse against the currents That bore the ships whither whimsy willed But to lash with strong ropes together The seven vessels cast about by wind and rain That the fleet would not scattered far, The marines of Shurupuk, drowned deep Beneath the swollen rivers and sea Were the noble city's walls and washed From every map of Earth were the bright towers, Made ready for battle against Heaven's hosts, Preparing spears and bows and shields Or else speaking such incantations To bind Fortune's vagaries to their cause, Enchanting each shaft to fly true And preparing charms to ward the bolts Of Heaven that they would find no mark. Thus did the last of the Nephilim Use what time was theirs within the storm Before the coming of a greater storm. Storing up their strength for battle UtaNapishtim and his brave retinue Let the wind carry them where it will Across the black and frothing sea That seemed to boil with spite for men. On those gross waters did they drift In many directions though all direction Was lost in that dark waste of the flood."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 275 Ten thousand sights did appear Like phantoms from the eternal gloom Before then being left to fade once more Into those shadows that spawned them. Lo! Did a mountain's peak appear Now made a petty island by the tides grown great And on there stood, made mad with famine, Some twenty woman with mewling infants Clutched tight to their parched breasts And others not accommodated on that land Struggled helpless in the waters round about Before they sank into the depths. Still mercilessly rose the waters to take all the mountain But UtaNapishtim was denied witness of that end As the pitiful spectacle was shrouded once more By the shadows that closed about it. Other images appeared and went like smoke But ever haunted the dreams of those that saw And faded not from tormented sleep. Fragments of the life of men floated by, Wooden chairs and tables and cribs Were borne by and more gruesome things. Boats crewed with corpses or those that yet lived, Unreleased from their shrivelled frames. The cadavers of men and beasts, Bloated with decay, went also on the waves. Would that the world had drowned more easily And the artefacts of that destruction Even in death had not sought the surface. In that twilight of the storm My eye's perceived an eternity of nightmares And the long years diminish not Those fadeless days of horror. Those words of Michael to his disciple, Noah, Fathomed not the deed they did. At the prow I stood with UtaNapishtim And sought comfort for the king of Shurupuk With these words, knowing that not at him alone Were my persuasions intended but to myself That my own heart might be unpained Yet those words were so empty as are all words"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 276 When the eyes bear another witness. Some sights make silent all words. So did I speak to UtaNapishtim: \"UtaNapishtim, son of UbarTutu, Most terrible indeed is all this That appears to your eyes and assails Most vehemently the mind behind those eyes. You are the witness of a most abhorrent deed And I know not what there is to say That might make these sights more reasonable When they seem to the reasonable insane. These children that I have sired To build the eternal empire to succeed That which commits such atrocities Are defiant creatures indeed. Do you think that they would go quiet to death? They do not but proclaim those wrongs That are worked against them. You that bears witness to this cry Must not be diminished by the sufferings That you are presented with But must be made strong by them And in the flames of this torment Your metal must be tempered to new resolve That when the hosts of Heaven come You might well argue for those that have no voice. If these sights would make you weak Against Heaven you shall surely fall And then their victory would be complete And that which is seen here shall not be remembered But it shall be glorified by those that write the history. Only if you are strong shall your witness Be of any virtue to those that are so vilely wronged. Make strong then your heart And let these wraiths move your heart to anger And let that anger make you strong Against the Elohim who shall surely seek To make this crime complete. This is not a time for sorrow. Libations enough can be poured out for the dead"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" 277 When all is won and the waters once more recede. Now the only fitting libation for their shades Is the blood of the Elohim. Let nothing deter you but make you strong. So do I exhort you.\" UtaNapishtim spoke no reply Yet I perceived in his eyes That my words reflected that which was already resolved And that course that he pursued. Yet I had barely breathed again after speech When some keen-eyed watchman gave up a shout And then blasted on his horn. Now in the great veil of cloud above That made black the sky and into night, Starless, transformed the day, A great gap opened in the East To display the rising sun and yet more For the new blue sky, as though seen for the first time Shone with a thousand wings of flame And a thousand suns were seen on spear-heads. So came the hosts of the Elohim. Now, as though the very stars fell from their place And rushed downward to destroy the Nephilim They made their assault upon the ships. From the distant mists resolved their forms To become more apparent to the eye Than that indistinct mass that first we saw. Before the great and winged column, Bearing in his left hand haughty Heaven's standard And in his right that feared weapon that cut down All that would oppose his father's purpose, The quadruple scythe that reaped harvests For the king of Heaven and cleared All choking herbs from Yahweh's kingdom, Went Gabriel as general of the host. At his back came some ten thousand of Elohim knights, Arrayed in shining arms, with shaft and shield Taken up for war. At this first appearance went up from the ships A great clamour of dismay"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" 278 For bold and strong though my children were They were but few against so great a foe And could hope not to stand against the Elohim. Yet but for an instant did fear seize their hearts For of the Nephilim these were the best And feared no travail of torment. Now, like the trumpets' blare, Rang out the voice of the king, Shurupuk's great lord, UtaNapishtim, And awoke from terror's sleep His brave knights and seers to action And cast weakness from their limbs: \"Enough, no time is their for despair Though if ever was it due It is due well now. Now we must act against the foe. Magicians of Shurupuk, to assail the ships They have opened in the veil of storms A portal by which to pass from Heaven to Earth. Beat, beat your Magyar drums And close upon them the thunderous gates And cast against them with double force Those storms that have long assailed us. Swiftly now and work your spells Else this day is surely lost to us. Now my brave archers draw back your strings And play for me that singing melody of death. Those that are not driven from the sky By the rain of water from the clouds Shall be torn down by a more steely weather And cast into these swollen waters To which our own brothers and sisters Have been cast by them. All others must make ready other arms By which to defend the wizards and the bowmen For but by them can we keep from flight The winged foe that we wi thout wings may contend Not at a disadvantage on the field But rather hold the one respite from the air That rages with bolts of flame and our own steel."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 279 Swiftly then and fulfil this command Or else all is lost to us.\" Now was a drum-beat like the thunder's peal And a low moaning chant By which the wizards worked their charm And from their flesh their spirits passed Into the storm clouds and animated the winds. Before true knowledge of what was to be Was the Elohim's the gates were shut upon them And they were in the very midst Of the howling tempest, redoubled. Many were at that instant blasted By the flaming sky-bolts and fell Like stars into the seas And yet others blinded by the rain and mists Could not check their flight And were too taken by the waters. Yet from the tumult of the sky Came a greater number undamaged By the wizards' work yet in disarray. Even as the Elohim horns rang out To marshal once more the column The bows of Shurupuk then sung their song And feathered barbs carried on an enchanted breeze Flew for the disordered ranks And mingled with the torrents Some redder pigment and heavier shapes, Swiftly lost, weighed down by mail, Beneath the churning waves. Now, rallied by the frantic signalling Of clarions and flags, the Elohim came, Screaming rage above the thunder In one awesome charge against the ships And yet not with some desperation, knowing That could they not gain the solid timbers They would find no respite upon wing. Seven times sang bowstrings before they closed And seven times shining shapes precipitated From the ragged ranks into the froth below. Then were the Elohim upon the ships."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 280 Upon every ship the knights of Shurupuk Rushed forth to meet the Elohim spears With mace and javelin and battle-cry And soon were the decks slick with gore Where but rain had made them slick before. Yet and yet sang the archer's bows Cutting from the winds those of Heaven Who found no perch upon the crowded decks. Now upon the ships of the king Where UtaNapishtim himself contended, Striking down to each side The Elohim that fought in desperation against him, Shattering alike shield and skull By his great mace of meteoric iron, Alighted Gabriel with whirling scythe And walked lion-like amongst the Nephilim warriors, Severing limbs in so frenzied an assault That it could be not perceived at which moment A blow was done and the next begun. Seeing my children butchered so I cast from my shoulders that midnight cloak That had hitherto concealed me from all eyes And leapt forward with an eager sword And drove it deep into the side of Gabriel. Seeing this appearance sudden amongst them The Nephilim took new heart and rejoiced And taunted with new words their foes And renewed their attack with greater vigour, Driving back the Elohim hosts To the very brink of the ships That they stumbled but a few paces more And would be taken by the boiling ocean. In the ecstasy of new hope So the Nephilim intoned or sang: \"See you then this, you Elohim That would contend most rashly against Shurupuk. Even such profound darkness as of this tempest We are deserted not by our sire. Wherever we do find ourselves And against what perils we must set ourselves"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" 281 Ever is great Satanael at our sides, Coming forth from some hidden place To defend us and stand with us.

Now do we rejoice for Satan stands amongst us And his swift sword fights our cause Whereas your lot is despair. Rejoice Nephilim and once more to arms That we might make absolute Our victory and the Elohim's destruction.\" Now I matched myself against Gabriel And the scythe of four blades That shrieked like a hurricane As it again and again cut at me To be turned aside at that last moment By my sword, exerted much To assuage the onslaught of Heaven's prince. The wound that I had carved upon him Diminished Gabriel not at all But made him strong with anger. This way and that way, across the deck Satan and Gabriel contended With the clash of arms ringing above the thunder. Now, as it seemed that I had gained advantage Gabriel, pressed back against the mast, Kicked out with a boot against my leg And with some cruel spur opened on my calf A bleeding maw and I fell back And found myself seated on the boards of the deck. Pressing at once his new advantage The second of the Elohim fell on me Swinging down towards my throat His spinning weapon of four blades. Once more did I withstand the blow Interposing between steel and flesh my own blade. Now though that first impetus was lost"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" 282 The Elohim now pressed down With a steadier strength and forced Towards my breast his own blade And I could find not strength to resist The steel's slow descent. Then was their joy upon the angel's face As he stood over and pressed down And mocking laughter upon his voice As he jeered my position And the battle raged all about us. \"So, my brother,\" spoke Gabriel, \"You thought to contend against me. How foolish it must seem to you now. Better it would have been for you Had you yet skulked in the shadows And dared not to oppose my purpose. O yes! Well did you match yourself Against our Father before Heaven's gates And that conflict you did win But this time you shall not vanquish But shall be vanquished. I am not some old dotard as are you accustomed to And not as weak-tempered as my brothers. Upon the battle's field Michael may have fled But that is not the way of Gabriel. More than this shall I tell you So you have full knowledge of your death That grows so near that its chill shadow My eyes even now perceive upon you . Like Michael's spear is my blade envenomed And not Baalzebub's immunity have you To the viper's sting or traitor's chalice. A single scratch alone and you are finished. Savour then these last moments As I savour them.\" Then a flash, a crash, And my eyes saw not nor my ears heard For an instant and I believed That it was some great spasm of the storm"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 283 Yet, regaining then my perception I saw that this was not so. In shards about me was my sword And about me fragments of a quadruple scythe Once joined as a cross but broken now Into a hundred parts and before me Like a bear enraged, Steadily, yet with most lethal purpose, Advanced UtaNapishtim, mace raised high, Mace that had shattered the weapons locked In that embrace of death escaped, Upon now unarmed Gabriel Who stumbled backwards to the stern. For a moment stood the Elohim prince In defiance of my noble son Whose life having saved myself with fore-warning Had now saved mine from death. Then did Gabriel cast himself into the sea And, in an instant, transformed Into an orca and fled into the waves. Now above the battle's din and storm Came a great sounding of horns And from the storm clouds came a host, Winged and arrayed in the scales of Giants. Thus did the hosts of Chadel Arrive to relieve the beleaguered Nephilim. Ishtar and Moloch leading at the head, Descended in most terrible guise. Ishtar appeared with a lion's head And in six hands held six spears With keen and barbed heads. Ever has it been the Shedim's way To assume some awesome form for battle. Moloch was himself unchanged Yet, as a flaming bull, was no less dreadful And after came a multitude of armoured warriors. Comprehending then that all was lost The Elohim gave up a great cry and made to flee But rising into the air They found themselves amongst my hosts And were hurled down by the charge"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 284 Into the ever-hungry sea. Thrusting to this side and that Soon, upon each of Ishtar's inclement spears Hung transfixed seven Elohim. Yet others of Heaven's ill-chanced host Plummeted downwards like flaming comets, Ignited by the blazing hooves of Moloch. Thus were Elohim destroyed completely. Even as the last of Heaven's host Was lost beneath the swollen waters A great wind blew up from the East And for some three hours howled its all, Scattering to flight the heavy rain clouds And unveiling the blue of the sky. Now from the ships went up a cheer That the foe had been vanquished And that great Deluge was now ended. For seven days did the waters recede, Flowing back to their hidden reservoirs. First did the mountains' heights appear As the waters receded from them And then, the tides falling back and back In constant ebb as once they had flowed great, The mountain-sides and hills Then the valleys and the plains Revealed themselves to the sight Of those that went upon the ships And they rejoiced to see all things Upon the Earth restored to equilibrium. At that time all the land was bare And no green thing grew from the soil. All was desolated by the great Cataclysm. Yet no darkness is there where no light burns Nor despair that fosters no hope. Deep beneath the barren soil hid the seeds Of the thousand plants, washed away By the waters of the Flood. With the waters fallen back to their place And the light of the burning sun Making warm once more the sodden earth To new life were those germs stirred"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 285 And even before the waters had retreated utterly The hill-sides bloomed with flowers of every hue And the plains were made verdant with grasses. Now made the weary sailors for some harbour Renouncing then their long companions, The waves and froth and porpoises To seek that more familiar to their birth. Thus made the storm-buffeted ships For some near cove to make landing. Thus alighting upon the Earth As though it were for the first time That their feet had gone on solid rock, Some fell down, wracked by weeping, And others danced and sang with joy. Yet UtaNapishtim was silent And I could read not in him The root of such impassiveness. Thus did mankind go forth From the sea-shore to the distant hills To learn of their new land To which the storm had brought them. Nowhere did they find a trace Of those that had been before. It was as though all remembrance of before the Flood Had been carried off with the tide, Lost forever to the Earth Save in the hearts of those that came after. Now I went to UtaNapishtim Who already busied himself with work Throwing up walls and making into order The fields of grain with the plough. Now did I address him with these words: \"UtaNapishtim, son of UbarTutu, Fondest of all my children, From this place let your people go forth Let them become numerous And govern all the Earth As once did they before go forth From this land to reign over the Earth Before the waters took them."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 286 For, by some irony of the wind, You have been brought to that very port Where first you rigged the sails.

Nothing is there that has been lost That shall not be restored to you And gained again twice over. For even as the tides flow to claim the shore So do they ebb once more To restore that which they once snatched. Have, then, no fear for the battle is won. Now must I depart from you Though it is not without sadness For my love for the Nephilim is great. The Shedim must once more return to Chadel And hold its walls against the enemy For, defeated, the Elohim are vengeful And will take reprisal if they could. I shall go with Dagon and forever bind Within the Earth these titanic waters That they will never rise again to take the Earth. From this is mankind ever safe. Now rejoice and go to conquer. Yesterday indeed is washed away But tomorrow is your inheritance.\" Thus did I turn from UtaNapishtim And went swiftly to join my host, Awaiting me at the shore, That the king of Shurupuk would not see my tears. Thus returned the Shedim to Chadel. Thus came again the Nephilim Unto the Land between Two Rivers. For a thousand days did his people labour To make fit for men the ancient land, Assailed by steel and water And throw up walls to echo Shurupuk's Now lost forever, washed from the Earth."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" 287 Their lands did they name Chaldee, Recalling in that name the older nation That fought at their side against the Elohim, The eternal land of the Shedim. Noah too and his kin found land Though with less dignity than those I sponsored And their ship was caught by a double peak And teetered above the receding waves. Yet once the waters had gone from the land Noah opened the doors of his great ship And released onto the Earth Those beasts that he had carried with him And his people went forth to live on Earth. Thus were the lands repeopled With both men and beasts. UtaNapishtim sent forth his people From the cities of his land To go beyond Tigris of the rising sun And to go from the western bank Of the river, Euphrates of the setting sun, To restore once more the nations of the Earth. Passing beyond the western frontier of the land, Crossing then the river of Lamech's death Who had so rashly sought to cross over, Passing into the western lands The people of Chaldee discovered there The children of Noah, descended from their mountain. Perceiving that they abased themselves to Yahweh And knowing well in their hearts That such was not fit for men They went forth amongst the villages Where lived the children of Noah And conquered them by flame and bronze. Then went they to the altars of Adonai Yahweh And poured there libations to the Nephilim shades And the people of deep Chadel. Thus did they restore to me the children of Noah.

Adonai Yahweh nor all his angels Have not one chain's link to bind you Save those that you would forge And put about yourself with full will. No fire is there into which they would cast you Save that which your minds would kindle. They have no authority over man Save that man would, deluded, kneel And acknowledge such illusion of power With which the Elohim would beguile. Why are you led again and again Into that same trap which snared those that came before? What words are there for me to speak By which you would realise this And take care against such deceits? No words had I for Abraham That would sway his foolish heart Nor unblind him to the fraud of Heaven That led him on such evil paths. In Heaven, in his tower, Where yet he brooded on defeat And saw no way to salvage what was lost to him, Michael heard the prayers of Abraham. Yet where had he once used Noah He had met with failure Now offered once more the same prize He dared not to reach out to it Least he once lose as he had once lost before. Rather then he reasoned to wreak some mischief Upon this one of the Nephilim If all others would give to him No opportunity to be so seized.

Abraham sings daily Your praise And raises his voice in prayer. Let me then claim him for Your possession. Yet after the failure of the Flood And Gabriel's humiliation at the hands Of that most wicked of the Nephilim, UtaNapishtim who defied Your will,"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 290 Little traffic do I desire With that blasphemous race of men. Let me rather sport with this one And avenge upon this one at least Those wrongs that his race has done You. Let me then test well Abraham's resolve To worship Adonai Yahweh And let him prove his worth to You By suffering capricious whimsy. In this at least shall we teach Satan and his people some lesson And show to them that not yet Do they have dominion over Earth.\" And Adonai Yahweh did but nod To show to Michael that his words seemed good To him that had been so wronged by that tongue That slandered brothers and deceived The king whose praises it should have sung. Then Michael descended to the Earth And went to Abraham where he dwelt In the land of Haran. As a great image, one hundred cubits high And burning with a white flame Came Michael before Abraham And spoke unto him these words: \"Abraham, son of Terah, Go you from this land of Haran And take from this place your wives And those servants of your household. You must forsake your kindred and people That dwell in the land of Haran For they are most corrupt And worship not the true God. Yet you of all men would He save And remove hence to another land Which He has allotted to you.

Go then to this land with your household And forsake these evil people That you would dwell amongst.\" So gathered to him Abraham his household and his consorts, Sarai and Hagar, the Egyptian, And went from the land of Haran Unto the land Mamre. Well amused was Michael at this work For Mamre was a land but of sand And the kingdom of scorpions and jackal And no fit place was it for men. Yet Abraham went there with his people Because Michael had willed him do so. There did Abraham make his home And there was he beset with great hardship. Yet despite the rigours of the land Abraham persevered with his lot And made fertile the soil with deep wells And reaped from it a fecund harvest. In the land of Mamre, the women of Abraham Brought forth sons for him. Hagar the Egyptian was mother to Ishmael First of the sons of Abraham And then was Isaac, son of Sarai. Yet of his two sons did Abraham Love Ishmael the best of them For he was the first born. Yet of this love was Sarai jealous for her son And despised Hagar for her son. With subtle whispers and with lies Did she deceive Abraham And turn his heart against his first-born And the mother Hagar the Egyptian. So became Abraham the reflection of his god. When her work was done"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" 292 And Abraham's heart was set against Hagar And Ishmael was robbed of his favour Went Sarai to Hagar in anger And spoke to her these words, Driving her ever with her son From the house of Abraham: \"Go from here, Egyptian. Depart my house for there is no love for you And I desire you not here. Abraham is now set against you Where once you held his love By your deceits and intrigues. Go with your son from here And be cast out into exile For if you remain You shall be visited with those miseries That my ire can devise. The house of Abraham is no more for you And Hagar and Ishmael must go hence And find for themselves what they Amongst scorpions of the wilderness. Go then, Egyptian, And depart my house. Leave Abraham to me and Isaac.\" So fearing for her life Fled Hagar into the desert, Taking with her Ishmael, her son, Preferring the mercies of the desert To the jealousy of Sarai. Yet no water was there in the desert And no food for the exiles. And though she searched long No spring could Hagar find And her breasts became dry of milk By which to feed her infant. Yet ran Hagar between two hills, Seven times, from one hill Unto the other hill and back To seek water but found it not."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" 293 Then, exhausted of all strength, Hagar fell to her knees and wept, Resigning to death her life And that of Ishmael. Yet when all hope was lost to her And a dark shadow rested on her heart A gentle was heard by her And, looking upward from the sand, She perceived before her a semblance of a man, Robed all in resplendent white Yet bearing no other ornament. Jet-black curls, like some hanging herb, Tumbled down his back And within his eyes was an eternal sorrow. Three times with his left heel did he strike the soil And forth from it came a spring of clear water And five times with his right And good things to eat appeared. So did the spirit speak to Hagar: \"Have no fear of this desert now Hagar for you are now protected And I stretch over you my hand To shield you from all harm From here shall you take your son To distant Arabia where he shall build a city And be there a great king Though now he be but an exile. Rejoice now Hagar for your woes are ended. Do you see me so, Satan? Am I like my brothers now. I have not forgotten what it is to be noble. Nor does my memory fade of Heaven's greater years When the Elohim were indeed most noble And their glory unmatched in all the world. What are Michael's petty sports to me? An omen of our decadence. And what are the schemes of Gabriel? Tears for what is lost to us. Heaven's doom may well be written But I shall yet fight to hold"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" 294 Those lost treasures of that kingdom. Do my words mean aught to you, Hagar? They do not and it seems that I rave. Yet fulfil that command I give you And remember with kindness The name of Raphael.\" So went Hagar from the land of Mamre. And, Raphael, I too recall Heaven's glories But they are now lost to you. You remember too late what treasures were true And indeed worth holding though others be lost. For Hagar I would spare you But it is not in my hands to do so. You are damned by your own hand And are beyond my reach. Yet of all the Elohim I would call you alone my brother. From this time did five years passed And not one night did Abraham find sleep That he did not weep for Ishmael Who he thought to be dead. Even as, in Raphael's mercy, I had perceived some light In all the darkness of Heaven Now did I witness the profoundest Of the shadows of Heaven. Michael, what moved him to such depravity I know not nor would know For this crime of his exceeded al others. Whether cruel caprice moved his heart Or some yet darker will Or lunacy howling in his head I shall not know And here does my intelligence fail me. Now did silver-bearded Michael Descend once more from high Heaven And came to Mamre where dwelt Abraham And appeared before him, Arrayed in royal cloth. Purple and gold bedecked him"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" 295 And the soft hides of beasts. In burning brilliance did he appear That Abraham was blinded To the darkness of his soul. Now he worked his villainy And spoke so to Abraham, Even now mired in sorrows enough: \"Abraham, son of Terah, Hear from me the will of God And listen well that you might enact That command He bids you do If you would be of the faithful. Adonai Yahweh asks of you a sacrifice That you might demonstrate to Him The perfection of your faith and love For His throne and reign. Yet heed well the word of Adonai Yahweh For He asks not of you some mere libation For even as the corrupt disciples of Satan Pour out libations for the Shedim And the shades of those that came before These things are done most easily And test not the profundity of fealty. More than their weak religion Does Adonai Yahweh require of His servant. Indeed some much greater thing Is the due of a king so great As is the King of Heaven. No less than this does your faith require; That you sacrifice as a burnt offering Your one beloved son, Isaac. This is the true will of God. Take your son hence to Moriah And there, upon the hills, Build an altar of stones And of wood a pyre. There strike down your son and burn him That the smoke might rise to Heaven. For as Adonai Yahweh reaches out His hand To strike down His rebel son"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" 296 So shall the father's arm be stretched out To destroy his son. It is most just in this way. Deny not Adonai Yahweh That which it is His to ask But act with swiftness and with faith.\" Would that Abraham have rebelled And defied Michael's cruel command. Yet he did not but made no complaint Though his heart, robbed of the first Was heavy with sorrow for the second. Yet upon the dawning of the sun, Bloodying the East in birth, Abraham went out with his son From Mamre to the hills of Moriah, Taking with him a knife And gathering as he went some sticks By which to kindle flames to consume his son. Outrage! Tyranny! Atrocity! The very stones of the Earth cried out And protested against Michael's crime And the voices of the rocks and roots Were heard in deep Chadel And the Shedim came to know Of that which Michael had devised. To thwart this awful intent I did not delay But flew swift-winged through passages That wound through the darkness of the Earth And sought the upper lands of men. So came I to the lands of Moriah. There did I perceive Abraham, Going with his son unto the mountains, Thus to amuse accursed Michael. Isaac knew not of what fate was his Should he ascend the mountain But in the eyes of Abraham was awful torment, His heart divided betwixt two tempers Of pious faith and paternal love. Such pain was his and he was made so weak That he leaned sometimes upon his son"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" 297 Or fell behind to weep unseen. Then I could not check my tongue But cried out, unwilled, to the wretched man To persuade him from that path: \"Abraham, what are you doing? Why must you do this terrible thing? Fulfil not Michael's command And bow not to this dark desire. Why do you go to the mountain with your son? You cannot hide your heart from me And I perceive well your intent. Is this an act of piety? I implore you, turn back And do not this thing that you would do. You know not what it is That Michael has asked of you. What will you burn as your offering? You truly do not know. Yet I, Satanael, know what it is To give up children to Michael's tyranny. Countless multitudes of my children drowned Beneath the waves by his tongue. Yet you do not know what it is you do. You burn not just flesh upon your fire But your joy, your dreams, your very soul. All that is sweet in the world to you Shall become black smoke upon the wind For the sake of Michael's cruel whim. You destroy not just your son But yourself also. Do not this deed I beg you.\" Yet Abraham heard not my words And heeded not my pleading But took up a stone into his And cast it at me striking my brow. Isaac also, that I would save, Took up a stone and cast it. Thus did they drive me from them. Yet I felt no pain of those stones"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" 298 For I was already full of pain. Yet I would yield not that child To Michael's cruel design But sought some other ear to hear my prayer. So I flew higher and then higher To stand before those gates That, having passed through from within, Were ever barred to me without. Thus I came to Heaven's gates And there did I cry out, Invoking my father's name To summon him from within That I might entreat him to be merciful In dealing with his servant. I called to that portal of impassive wood And to those beyond these words: \"Adonai Yahweh, come forth from hiding To hear him that was once your son And loved you well though you knew it not. Not for my sake have I come to these gates That are most hateful to my eye But for one of those of yours That you would bear to suffer Though I, your enemy, would bear it not. Why do you ask of Abraham his son When already one is lost to him? Has he not loved you well And been a most faithful servant to you. Why then would you abuse him so? You know as I know, For I have suffered this at your hands, What it is to lose a beloved son For so is Satan lost to you. Yet Abraham has loved you As once I had loved you. Will you then repay him with this treachery As you so long ago betrayed your son. Will you visit upon this pain, He that has well served you, Knowing well this pain in your own heart."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":" 299 If indeed you have ever loved him That was once your best beloved son, If this love you have ever cherished In the name of that love I entreat you Spare Abraham his son.\" Yet from beyond the walls came no reply At first and I waited in silence. Then at the rampart above the gate Appeared a rank of figures, in a while, And the looked down on me With stern gazes and with bows. One hundred Elohim knights stood above. Then in another while, above, I perceived that one whose audience I had sought, Adonai Yahweh himself stood at the gate And looked down on me with hatred Yet not without some sorrow As though he then relived that time When I had first gone forever from his gates. Arrayed in splendour was the king of Heaven Yet, even so far beneath him, I felt a weary burden of years heavy on him. Not as great as once he was he seemed to me. Yet with majestic voice he addressed me With contempt and with wrath. O what darknesses are there within us That set us to drive swords Into those that we would love the best. With such anger did he seek to persuade himself That truly he mourned not my loss And with such defiance in my heart Did I smother some love within me That yearned once more for that one I had loved So many years before this time. Not this had I thought to find There before the gates of Heaven. Never had two so close Been yet so far from the other. So spoke the king of Heaven: "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" 300 \"So Satan, you come before me To plead for the life of a son Of some mortal man upon the Earth. If that bond between a father and a son Is so sacred to you why then did you betray And turn against your own father Your every strength and wits When these things should have been employed In the love of your beloved father. Your treachery refutes your words And all here would bear witness to it. This love that you would invoke And compel me by, yourself Have you sundered its power over me. Yet in one way do you words seem true. Abraham indeed has been a faithful servant to me And does love me as you do not. For his sake I might spare his son But not for yours, Satan, Nor any love that you might call upon. I have no love left for you. Yet if indeed you spare Isaac Then there is a price that must be paid And you shall be the payer. This is my decree to you. If you would bargain for the son Of my faithful servant Abraham Who willingly would give him up for me Then these two injunctions must you heed. First is this: though I take him not Isaac is yet mine and so his progeny. Those that are descended of him Shall be my nation and are sacred Not Shedim or Nephilim may conquer them And you shall not seek to take them back. You must give to me as a payment Isaac and his children And they shall be unconquered on the Earth. The second payment is a harder one Though I am sure that you shall pay it. If I am to be denied Isaac"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 301 As the burnt offering of Abraham Then you must take Isaac's place upon the altar. As he would have burnt So shall Satan burn upon the altar. This is what I demand If you are to spare Isaac.\" Adonai Yahweh spoke so to me And even in that moment I knew That the love which I had called upon Was not now sacred unto him Yet for me was it still some treasure Worth preserving and for it Would I give up much. Thus did I bow my head before Heaven's gates And accede to the tyrant's will That I might spare my child this pain. \"Yes, Adonai Yahweh,\" I spoke, \"As you have willed it so shall it be. Yet know this of which you would command, Firstly, of that second thing: Abraham is not of the great men of old And has not the strength to destroy me. His knife may cut me But knife is there that he could forge That would slay me Nor fire is there for him to kindle That would consume me. Indeed his knife shall wound And that pain I would suffer gladly As I have suffered before this pain, First creating the Nephilim. The flames of his fire may burn me And this pain too shall be a blessing to me That Abraham knows not this pain. Yet none of these shall destroy And I shall endure thereafter. Then of the first thing you have willed. So long as Isaac's children are yours Then my hand shall not move against them"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":" 302 And the Shedim shall not win them back. Yet not mine to command are the Nephilim For they are free of my power. Yet should this nation forsake your altar And come before the Shedim Then you have no recourse against me For it is of their own will that they do this thing And they shall be conquered by my greater nations And they shall dwell in exile Be it in Chaldee or else in Egypt. Know also that they are but secure against the Shedim Yet their nation shall be destroyed Not by my hand but by one of the Elohim. This do my eyes see clearly. Those that I give to you, Exile and ruin is their lot Just as it is yours. Thus have I acceded to your will And go now to the Earth To take upon the form of a goat That I might be a sacrifice upon the altar. Send then Raphael unto the Earth That this cruel sacrifice might be abated. I shall die in Isaac's place But I shall live and I shall conquer And this wrong will be undone And Isaac shall be restored to me As shall all men upon the Earth. Great wrong have you done to me And, so doing, you have destroyed yourselves. I go now from your presence And never again shall I invoke love between us. No more dealing is there between. Now there is but war.\" So went I to the Earth And unto the hills of Moriah Where Abraham raised his knife Above his quiet infant's breast Upon the sacrificial altar of piled up stones. There did I take upon the form of a he-goat"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" 303 Whilst is was that Raphael Went unto Abraham and stayed his hand. These words he spoke to the man, Bent over with the years and wit grief, Whose face was stained with tears Most bitter with salt and sorrow: \"Abraham, son of Terah, I am Raphael of the Elohim And I bring to you this command From Adonai Yahweh, King of Heaven. Your God is a merciful god And would ask not of you The one son that remains to you And is now assured of your faith And asks no more proof of you. Most exalted amongst men are you, Abraham, and high in God's estimation. Take instead this he-goat And offer this one instead of Isaac Upon your altar and in the flame. So has Adonai Yahweh willed it And so shall you do. Be now at peace Abraham And rejoice in the mercy of God.\" So was it then that I was taken to the altar And for the Nephilim suffered again The knife's deep bite And I was consumed also by the flames And my borrowed form became as smoke. When the sacrifice was done Abraham fell upon his knees and wept And Isaac wept with him. Raphael and Satan wept also For all that had been lost and won And those dark roads yet to be walked. Now once more became solid the smoke And my native form was restored to me And I returned to deep Chadel Just as Raphael returned to Heaven,"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" 304 Leaving Abraham and Isaac on the hill, Holding each other and weeping And looking upon the world As though it had become new to them. As I stood atop the Spire of Opal and Ruby And looked out across the city It seemed to me that I had walked so far Along the road yet it was just begun And it would grow but steeper yet As our path sought newer heights. And another looked out from a tower In high Heaven who had fled a mace, Casting himself into the merciless waves. Gabriel pondered now all that was And whirled anew above his head The new forged steel of his scythe. He stood in thought of all that had been And planned for tomorrow. He resolved that as had Michael betrayed The elder brother and the father's favourite Such a custom he would not forsake And where Michael now reigned, He who sank yet deeper into corruption, Gabriel would one day be prince. Once more he looked out from his tower Across the wide expanse of Heaven And resolved that it should all be his. For such resolution would three kingdoms pay dear And the three races, Shedim and Elohim, And of all the Nephilim Would pay dearest for Gabriel's ambition In those dark days that were to come. This is the truth!"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" 305 Pyloclasm Hear me o my prophet! In those later days, the successors Of the bright days of the Flood, The ancient days of great men, Then a peace was there Between Earth and Heaven And the Elohim withdrew from the Earth, Seeking not a conflict lost to them. Rather did they bide their time Within the walls of Heaven And looked not from their towers To that which was lost to them.

These were the days of King Solomon, He that was born of Isaac's line Yet learning wisdom, thus perceiving Who was the teacher of the true path And he led his people from the dominion of God And poured out libations at my altar. Yet the Elohim cared not for men's affairs. So did time pass and its passing was not marked By momentous happening as had once before Crowded pages of the histories. Not that these days were uneventful But those happenings of those days were of a quality That changed nothing of the future's. In those days ten thousand empires waxed great Yet none persisted and did fall. The great men of older days had passed from the world And awaited rebirth in a distant womb, Walking not amongst the nations of men. Chadel, in those days, was quiet And the Shedim were roused to no action By the doings of the Nephilim or Elohim But yet watched and awaited Those that might come later To fulfil that foreseen destiny And build amongst my children An eternal empire to exceed Heaven And reign most potent over all Creation. Yet was it in those days That Ishtar came to me Where it was that I watched all things That passed upon the Earth Within a magic mirror of mercury. It was a time not long before Tanit, Ishtar's favoured queen, Had fled from Tyre to Africa And there had built a great city, Known to men as Kart-Hadasht And in later days as Carthage.

Yet as I watched and wept For the destruction of so many shining souls And yet rejoiced at such eternal glory As was seared upon the memories of men, Ishtar came to me and cried out, Invoking me to action where there was a need. So reported the high queen of Chaldaea, So spoke the idol of the Phoenicians, Of that dire news of which she had learnt. So did Ishtar speak: \"Satanael, Commander of Our Hearts, Know you not what passes. Not so idle would you sit Were it that you knew of my knowledge But would rather be stirred to action By such wrath and anguish to consume you. Have you not promised to the Nephilim That after death you would recall their souls That once more from that which they have flowed They might flow once more to in return? This indeed have you promised to them. Yet do you not know that this is not so And that they flow not back to you But are rather abducted from you That they abide with Mot in Sheol And are as slaves to the Lemure-King.

Never has so great a burden Been so great a joy to bear. I am ever with you And shall forsake not the Nephilim. Most gravely did I learn this news And, hearing, indeed knew both rage And that anguish that had been promised me.

Well is it in my power to conquer Mot But for Ereshkigal's standing with him. I cannot oppose both these Archons Without then weakening myself to Heaven. Yet by some stratagem shall I win. Mot is a greedy spirit and hungers for warmth As only those that abide in the chill of death Might hunger for the warmth of life.

Yet deeper into the abysmal Ishtar went, Seeking in the very roots of the Earth Planted long aeons past by the Archons Into whose hands she now cast herself. Thus went Ishtar to the gates of Sheol, Found in the darkness without light Where primal Mummu eternal slept. Thus stood Ishtar before Mot's gates And there demanded entrance And audience with the king Of that dark Land of Shadows. With resounding and imperious tongue She commanded those lemures that watched Over the portals of despair That would open but one way And permit no egress, Demanding that they should open wide the doors That she might pass inwards And address Mot himself. With such sorcerous runes did she bind them That no will had they to defy That which she willed of them.

Yet at that time, full of despair, Sitting before Mot's throne She saw as Mot did see a bird, A crane of silver that flew fast to throne And descended before the Archon, Holding in a human hand a pouch, Woven of most fine silks And decorated with shining pearls, Though in Sheol they shone not. Now bowing low, the Shedim's herald For indeed was this apparition Ashmedai, Offered to Mot the burden and these words: \"O Mot, abysmal king of Sheol, Most tardy have you been in reply To noble Satan's embassy So that he has become impatient with you And has sent me as a second. So that you might be more swift In greeting me with due honour He has seen fit to furnish a gift,"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":" 317 Worthy of a king so great as you.

Return to us Ishtar that you keep For Satan would not see her languish here. More than this I have none to speak Until you have looked upon Satan's gift And know more of how you must treat with me.\" Thus saying did Ashmedai bestow the sack And Mot received it. Opening the cloth, he put in his hand And withdrew from the sack that which it held, Indeed a most dread apparence. What gift did I bestow on Mot, He that had chosen to be my enemy? From the fine pouch a most gory thing was issued, The bleeding head of Ereshkigal, The hag-bride of Mot. Even cold Mot became hot with ire At such a presentation to him And raged most great against Ashmedai, Howling and crying out, Brandishing with wrath his black fist. Yet before such a storm stood calm Both Ishtar and Ashmedai. These words did Mot speak in his rage To the Shedim that faced him And fled nor yielded to his rage: \"Accursed Shedim, would you so treat With the king that commands your fate?"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" 318 Why do you dishonour me so With this affront, calling a gift What is an offence against me? Do you imagine that my vengeance will be light When my shame is so great Should such crime go unavenged? No! Most sore indeed shall you pay For Satan's perfidious embassy. Ten thousand pains and torments Shall be known to you here in Sheol And think not of escape from here. Those that pass into Sheol They pass not out once more. The gates open without only by my command And close tight save when I will it. Fully at my mercy are you two And for you have I no mercy. Never shall you leave Sheol For the gates are ever closed to you. Most unwisely have you acted And your precious prince has damned you. Never shall the shades he seeks Be restored to him And not shall his ambassadors Be returned to his house. Those that would try me so Shall be most wretched When it comes that I reckon with them. Do you hear me, Satan? Can you imagine what fury That your recklessness has loosed.\" So spoke Mot, king of Sheol. Yet even hearing such dire injunctions And perceiving the ire of the king Not daunted was Ashmedai But smiled irony at those words, Bleeding with bile most venomous. So spoke Ashmedai in reply: \"O great king, surely you think not"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":" 319 That Satan would be so rash As to so challenge your throne Lest already did he possess The full means of your undoing.

Most precisely did he forewarn Of your reply to my embassy And speak mockingly of your arrogant rage. This one more gift have I for you, Mot, To be given to you only at this time. So did Satan instruct me. See that which hold in my hand, Now pour upon the dark waste of Sheol. This dust, pale like bone, that slips, Calcined, between my fingers, Is not just gathered from the earth Nor else the ash taken from any embers. This is the sole remnant of that portal By which you would bind us to this land. Those gates that open outward Only at your will are as much a hindrance To our departing from you As are the gentle breezes of the summer Or else the new rain of spring. No instrument have you, Lord Mot, By which you might detain us here. More than this, without your land, Waiting at the threshold of your gates, Now less that ruins, tramped down, Are the hosts of Chadel gathered there. But a horn-blast shall decide your fate.

At her right hand was Ashmedai That I had sent to redeem her Most loved by Shedim and Nephilim. At the gates a host of Chadel's people Awaited their the princess, Ishtar, And awaited Ashmedai and the Nephilim That they might forever retire From those grim portals and walls And look no more upon desolate Sheol. The first of that host to greet her, She that walked upwards in triumph Was Abaddon the Destroyer, Captain of that great host Sent forth to break into many parts Those gates that closed in Those that I would have freer than all things. Shedim and Nephilim went from Sheol And went from that most profound darkness And sought by ascending passages The gates of Chadel and the towers That shone with the light of a fount of fire. Upon the great feast of spring they came Once more to the gates of Chadel, Those gates from which Ishtar had departed Full half a year, the long, cold winter, Before the time of her returning. First was I at the gates to greet And welcome her once more to her people That had mourned most bitterly her long absence.

The snow has fallen upon the Earth And the wind shrieked as a raven. From the tempest have the Nephilim Known no respite and the hearth Has seemed most dim to them. Long has it seemed that the winter would not end And ever was the spring banished from us. This day has seen the return of spring And with spring has returned Ishtar. A double blessing on us is this. Ishtar, you are the bringer of spring, And by your courage is death conquered And what was dead has been made to live. This feast of spring I shall name for you So that the coming of spring Shall be the triumph of Ishtar, She that conquered the king of death, She that has ended the long winter.

All that are born of me All the Nephilim that shall exist Shall be born ever of me Again and again, without end, With each rebirth waxing ever greater. Eternal are the Nephilim that flow Upon the eternal cycle And they who do comprehend, Perceiving that death does not diminish But make ever stronger the Nephilim, They shall have no fear of death But only comfort in that true knowledge That they exist eternally. So it was that death was conquered. For some years it was after that time When the empire of Rome grew great And the Latini came to eclipse All other nations of the western world Whilst yet did China prosper in the East But not one of those two great kingdoms Learnt of the other. Proud Kart-Hadasht withstood not Rome's rise And fell to ash before the conquerors, Well mourned by the Shedim.

Dark ambition ruled the spirit Of the second prince of Heaven And his whispers ruled the minds of men And by ten thousand hidden movements Made emperor of all the world That was known to the people of the West Octavian that was called Augustus In the later days of his kingship. Nowhere was there in the motions of history That I saw not his hand But saw not the arm that guided. It was as though I matched myself against a shadow And I prevailed not against his subtle ways. Yet it was that the shadowed foe Was himself caught up most abstruse motion And struck down by a hidden hand. Amongst the daughters of Isaac Was one woman of great beauty And it was that the Elohim eyes Of dark Gabriel beheld her And were taken not from her But held by sorcery more potent Than Gabriel had power to overcome. Can it be that those that have love betrayed And defied all bonds of that blessed spell Might know the vengeance of outraged amour And submit to its potent poison That burns in the veins like flame And ignites the very soul with heat?

I shall not revile you for this thing, Love, Though most bitter is it to me For I have seen too much of your power. Betrothed to a simple carpenter was she, Mary, beloved of Gabriel the Hater, How did your bolt fly so untrue, And was it a difficulty to him Prince of Heaven's might and hidden king Of the fortunes of most potent Rome To take that maiden girl which he sought? She, what had she by which to defend, Against such a love, such a lover. Simple, pure and young she was And, appearing to her a vision Of such glory and brilliance to blind princes, What recourse had she before such presence. Such a tongue spoke with words and voice Of authority as she had never heard. What was she to him? One so much in his power Should not, it seemed to Gabriel, Master him so well. Was it then an act of love or hate? Was it then loving or rapine That Heaven's prince enacted on that day?

Great with child was Mary And it was manifest to her That her child would soon be born of her. Swiftly then made they haste To Bethlehem even as she cried out With the birth-pains of the child. At that time a comet burned in the sky And was above Bethlehem. A dire portent was that burning shaft That flamed amongst the stars Just as a beacon of the birth Of Gabriel's monstrous son, Doomed to doom the Nephilim And enfold in darkness the Earth. Thus beneath the omen of the fallen star In the town of Bethlehem was the child born. Gabriel's son came forth from Mary And his eyes burned with a savage fire. Apparent to all was his Elohim blood. Bloodied, long and tormented was that birth As though very world resisted A child that bore so great a curse, A child born of tainted love.

This is the first of many signs that I shall show That men may turn from wickedness to God And thus may be redeemed. Those that take not care of me, Most wretched are they, For they but earn Heaven's wrath.

Even as they had whispered to him in the womb Did they whisper to him in childhood And as he grew to be a man They whispered still though others heard them not, The Elohim of Gabriel's sympathy, Descended to him to sing of Heaven And, over and over, tutored him In that which he should speak Until he was completely given over To those lies that they taught him. Yet even when he was but a child Did those of Heaven perceive his destiny And that which would be wrought by him. Michael looked down from his prison-tower Where he ever watched all those about Whether without or else within, Ever guarding for the hidden knife Or else the cup brim-full of venom. No ease was there for Michael, Fallen far from Adonai Yahweh's favour Even as he had cast me far And now the traitor was betrayed By a thousand imagined threats. He saw on Earth below this Jesu And fear cleaved strong to him. Despite the madness that howled within And drew to his sight alone Visions of ten thousand hidden blades Each clutched by some shadowed form, His Elohim craft revealed to him What would be in future days And he perceived within the young child That by this agency would his power be destroyed And Jesu's father would gain over him Ascendancy in his father's eyes And for himself, eternal exile, Even as he had once banished another. Now was there a great dread Of that infant born to Mary In the heart of corrupted Michael"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":" 328 And he sought most resolutely The death of that child That would bring his final overthrow. So did Michael descend from his tower, Unwillingly, and from Heaven That he might act upon the Earth To end the child's life as it began When the son of Gabriel was yet young. To the king of Israel did he descend, Herod the great, tyrant of that land And servant to the lords of Rome. Approaching him while he slept He passed all sentries with a cloak Woven from the very stuff of night And intruded in upon the dreams, Dreamt by the king. Glorious seemed Michael to Herod's slumber And terrible to the sleeping king. With dire warning of ruin did he counsel And incite the king to action Against the boy-child, himself fearing The regent destiny of the infant. With these words did he command The king to most vile butchery, Speaking with a voice, trembling With both rage and fear: \"Herod, hear me, king, From Heaven am I come With most sorry news to you. Hear me, must you, else much is lost, Yet act with haste and it might be saved. You cannot know what doom is fallen Upon the kingdom of Israel And it would be lost to you Lest you strike out against the danger That has grown from a dark seed And would topple down the walls of Shalem.

What is to be a potentate Who would let his enemy grow strong against him? No time is this for weak pity For a new-born monster is yet monstrous And every tiger was once a cub. Spare not the children in the land's defence But send forth your warriors And strike down the male children Born within the year That this one shall not escape your wrath But know destruction that he shall never grow And oppose your most righteous kingdom.\" Having thus spoken to the king And worked his base persuasions Michael, fearing to tarry there, Flew the Earth and made fast within his tower To observe from far off The consequence of those words spoken. Herod had learnt well the ways of Rome And was unmindful of any care For which path was right and noble, Forsaking all that made man fine. Long seared from the city's bones Was all consideration of honour. Face, fame and wealth were the sole measure And he that betrayed was held highly If he could win for himself Those carnal things revered by Rome. Rome priced a man with gold And forgot all of virtue. Thus, with such a revelation,"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":" 330 No hand withheld the king's vengeance Upon a child unwronging. Yet Herod knew not which child to seek But rather gave this command to his men. That every child within his lands, Male and born within the year Was to be taken from the parents That had begat the son And killed lest it be that one Which should grow to be a man That might destroy his corrupt dominion. This terrible thing did he command And his warriors, paid with gold And of virtue most forgetful, Fulfilled the command of Herod, Fulfilling the command of Michael, Who, like Herod himself, Would fall unceasingly into the dark abyss That he might preserve his sovereignty Over the Elohim of Heaven. Thus Herod became but a mirror To the criminal soul of Michael Who, by the Flood, had slain my children. So went forth the soldiers of Herod To carry out his bloody instruction And went across the land To slay the infant sons of Galilee. How could I raise my hand against them That so destroyed the innocents That I raised not my hand against my children Though I had given them over to Heaven? Since that day of sorrow When had Abbadon struck down Methuselah And brought upon my children the Flood It has not been the Shedim way To make war upon the Nephilim. Too well do we know the price.

Appearing in a blast of flame He appeared to Mary and warned With these words the mother of his son To deliver the suckling babe from Israel Unto the river kingdom of the Pharaoh's That offered libations at the altar To Ashmedai, the thrice greatest, And to Aset, the bright goddess. Even as the soldiers of the king burst inwards With naked swords to claim the child Gabriel spoke these words with a desperate tongue To that daughter of the Nephilim That he had loved and of whose womb Jesu, son of Gabriel, was born, Addressing her with those words With which he had first approached her: \"Mary, most blessed of the women of the Earth, Mother to that prince most blessed That is the very son of Heaven. Swiftly must you fly hence For it is that Herod, king of Israel, Grows jealous of the blessing of your son And perceives in that boy That which would eclipse his kingdom. Thus, in his fear and hatred, Has he sent forth soldiers against us That the child shall be destroyed. This must not be.

As Mary fled with her son in her arms From the house that had homed them And went upon the road to Egypt, Terrible cries came from within. No strength had Herod's men Against the full wrath of Gabriel As he went amongst with four blades singing And, cutting to every side, Made bloody butchery of the stricken killers. Even as he whirled the dreadful instrument He howled his rage and the battle's joy So loud that even Heaven heard his voice And Michael in his high tower Fell to his knees with fear, Knowing well that his part Would not long be unknown to Gabriel. The company that yet waited without Heard both howls and screams come from within And such fear took them That they had not strength to flee That even when came forth from the portal A dread form, crimson-dyed with blood, They were cut down like wheat, Standing unresisting before the scythe.

When he was of fifteen years Went forth Jesu into the wilderness And there, in the desert, With but scorpions and jackals And with but locusts for his meat Did he think to meditate forty days That the spirits of the wild places Might be tamed by his hand That he might command them And master thus the sorceries That Gabriel had taught to him By the agency of dreams. Now upon this chance I seized, Perceiving his solitude in the desert That I might dissuade him from that path Upon which he now walked For my eyes saw but too clearly That its outcome would be but ruin. Every oracle cast by the Shedim And every omen that was read Told of nought but some unlucky end For the child born of Mary And in that ending yet greater woe.

No great beneficence of mine was this But the simple instinct of the parent. To love mankind without complaint Is the lot of Satan And to weep bitter tears for you That are so bent on hatred. This love, perhaps, I have found As a common treasure with Gabriel But no more shall I share with him. Thus did I seek the man, Knowing that I could not persuade A heart so bound with Gabriel's deceits But knowing also that, should I not try, The burden of a thousand future sorrows And the cries of the children's torment Would weigh double upon my heart. Better is it to fall short of a hope so distant Than to know the regret of inaction. When faced with the wrongs of the world It is not enough to say: \"Nothing could I do to hinder this.\" One must speak with an honest heart: \"All that it was in my power to do Was, by my power, done.\" To struggle ever against adversity Even when hope itself is lost Is the true road of the noble soul.

Yet ever are there t hose that will not see Even the most resplendent glories. What is most tragic is that Jesu's flawed vision Would obscure for long ages The sight of all men And they would reach not. This darkness did Jesu go forth From the desert to teach to the Nephilim Even as the Elohim had taught to him. Some were there that heard him And heeded that which he spoke And took it to themselves as truth. Others yet he persuaded by the agency Of the sorceries that he had learned. To health did he restore the sick, To wholeness he restored the cripple. Any that would know the secret charms Might accomplish such things as these And deeds greater yet or more subtle. Indeed to the eastern disciples Of the ancient Zarathustra Or to the druids of the West Such acts were simple things That Jesu performed as great.

So did they gather themselves together And went with one mind and one voice To Pontius Pilate that was suzerain Over Judaea by the will of Rome. Arrayed in their robes they went before him And before him did they fall down, Those that before knelt to but God Now knew the kingship of Caesar And took care to treat most humbly With that one he had appointed To speak and hear for him in the land. Passing into the palace of the Romans They looked about them and beheld High pillars of porphyry and images of marble, Likenesses of the gods of that people And their proud monarchs that with the gods Did number their own persons. Upon the walls were mosaics of many things: Bulls, porpoises and wondrous creatures, Made bright with tiles of shining colours, Blue, white, green, red and gold.

We place ourselves into your hands In the knowledge of your wisdom, Knowing that you shall judge our words With both fairness and sagacity.

When the people see this king Treated as any thief deserves Soon will their misplaced faith be lost And restored to the rightful object. Send men, therefore, to accomplish his arrest. Thus shall your kingdom be made strong. Hear then our suit to you And heed well our counsel for it is good. Treat well with those that are devoted to you. Hail Caesar. Hail Pilate. Praise to Adonai Yahweh.\" With such words did they seek to win To their cause the aid of most potent Rome. How well the Elohim had taught their nation, Instructing them in the art of flattery. Pilate heard the sycophants And pondered on their words."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":" 341 Having then considered this intelligence And read in what was said That which was not spoken But no less said by the Judaeans. This reply did he give to them: \"Who are these thralls that make such approach? They are indeed most arrogant. Do they deal with their own god so? I should that indeed they do not For if their Adonai Yahweh were so mighty As they would claim him to be They would not such presumption. Who are they that they lecture to me, Telling me how my duties are to be done? Caesar himself has appointed me emissary And given this land to my keeping. Not only then do they insult me But make insult also to the divine emperor. Am I then to believe of these ones That they are wanting in loyalty to Tiberius? Surely such a thing would not be so. Maybe I should make apparent to them That power which Rome holds over them. No! I shall show them mercy For their pretty speech has much amused me. Does this seem fair to you, Judaeans? It matters not whether you think That I be just or not For despite your flatteries You are as nothing to me. However, it is a wise sovereign That hears the words of his slaves And tries to accommodate, upon occasion, That which they would will. I shall send the soldiers of Rome To seek out this one you tell of And they shall bring him before me And I shall weigh the evidence on both sides And then sentence this Jesu. If he does indeed speak against Caesar"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":" 342 Then it is right that he is punished. So is it that I have commanded, Go then from my presence Lest I grow tired of you And have you amuse in some other way.\" Hearing so these words of Pilate Swiftly did the teachers of the law Flee from him in fear. So was it that the soldiers went out And sought out Jesu to arrest him. Yet the son of Gabriel was warned By those amongst the legions of Rome That were sympathetic to him And he hid from those men that came for him And by sorceries made himself obscure, Speaking charms to divert those eyes That sought him in his place of hiding That the seekers passed by him And did perceive him not. Thus did the hunters return Without their prey within the snare. Looking down from his high tower Michael once more beheld the Earth From which his sight was so long turned And his power pierced most easily Those enchantment by which Jesu was hid. Now did he stir within the heart Of one of those with the son of Gabriel Great jealousy of the teacher And with most cunning charms Turned against the master The intent of the disciple. This one was named Judas Iscariot. Thus was it that this Judas stole From the place of hiding by night And went to the Pharisees That sought the destruction of his mentor. For thirty pieces of silver he sold That which had been most dear to him. Judas was brought to the constables of Rome"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 343 And brought them to the house where hid Jesu, son of Gabriel, But bursting in upon the house They found nothing there within. So did the Pharisees and the captain Of the soldiery of Rome Turned upon Judas Iscariot, saying: \"Deceiver, why bring you us hither? None lie within these walls And none abide beneath this roof. Thorough search have our men made And found not the one we seek That you are compacted to bring us to. Your love of money has made you simple And this trick you have wrought on us That you might grasp our silver Will yet not avail you Nor shall you profit by this ruse. Return to us our silver swiftly And we shall spare you much pain When we chastise you for this chicane.\" Now did Judas fall upon his knees For he was descended of Isaac And had learnt well the Elohim arts. Kissing the feet of the guards' captain He begged his case and his life. Most wretched Judas Iscariot Perceiving that the b etrayer was betrayed By greed and cruel circumstance Thought then to redouble betrayal That treacherous betrayal be betrayed. With these words did he address the Roman And sought to preserve both life and silver: \"Please most merciful lord, I beg of you to spare me For I have not deceived you But have myself been deceived. Truly had I thought to find at this house"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":" 344 The person of the Nazarene That you would apprehend. He cannot have fore-knowledge of this deed Therefore it is but circumstance that betrays And not Judas Iscariot. Let me ponder for a moment What other place he might occupy. Make not so swift your sword Whilst I exhort to greater effort My wit that I might determine Where you shall find your quarry. Now do I conceive of it: Oft-times does he go to pray At some garden near to this place That is called Gethsemane. Go there and if you find him not Then strike me down as you will But shirk not this chance to discover That in truth I lead you not false But have been most faithful in my dealings.\" Jesu sat within the garden of Gethsemane Some way from his most faithful And invoked to him his father Though he knew him not as genitor But as an emissary of Yahweh. As he sat amongst the shadows of the trees, Amongst the leaves of which whispered A mocking wind as it danced and grabbed At the prophet's hair and cloth. Then in an instance was all made silent And the wind amongst the leaves Was made still in the night. Now did a cloud come across the moon And a chill fell upon Jesu And a profound loneliness was on him. In the darkness of the night He whispered to the Elohim And sought of them some comfort. Yet they answered him not.

When they cried out, they were saved And when they trusted to You They met with no evil. Why then must I be as a worm And stripped of my humanity? The people despise and revile me. I am mocked and they shake their heads at me And put out their lips in insult. They have said, 'Why is your faith not repaid? If you are beloved of God Why should He not then deliver you?' My enemies are about me like bulls, The mighty bulls of Bashan. Their mouths are as the maws of lions, So do they raven and gape. There are dogs that surround me, A company of evil men. They tear from my bones my flesh. Lord, stay not from me But come swiftly to my aid. Deliver from the sword my soul, Deliver from the dogs my life. Guard me of the lions And guard me of the horns of the Re'em.\" Now about him where Rome's soldiers And their swords were taken out. Casting his eyes to all sides He saw no path of escape. Now did the constables of the law Seize him by their hands And impelled him from the garden,"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 346 Binding him with cords. So did they bring him before the priests That he might be questioned Before he was brought to Pontius Pilate, Thinking that they might trick of him Some word or unguarded speech By which he might be shown guilty That they would not pay false witnesses To testify against him. At that time was Caiaphas High amongst Cohanim of God's temple And before him was Jesu forced down And made humble upon the floor. Now, as a trapper with prey in snare, Did he stalk about the prophet, beholding His captive from all sides And was well pleased with him. Now did Caiaphas so speak, Questions to invite such answers That spoken in repetition against Jesu Would most surely condemn him: \"Jesu, son of Joseph, Unless you would speak otherwise, Many words have been spoken And many voices raised against you. You are brought here but to determine If that which has been said Be false or true. All sides of the argument have I heard And the testament of witnesses Have I listened to over and over. Now would I but hear the man himself That is so reviled That I might determine What sort of man you are. Pontius Pilate bears many duties And must perform all with great diligence. I would not therefore bring a case If it had no foundation for its prosecution But if indeed you are a wrong-doer"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" 347 I am bound by my own duty To bring you before Pontius Pilate. My duties too are most burdensome And my time is short for you. Well would it reflect upon you If you were to confess to these crimes And I would speak well of you As you are sentenced by Rome's proxy. These then are the charges against you: First, have you spoken against Caesar And counselled to the Jews That they pay not the taxes That are due to Rome. Second, have you blasphemed against God Saying, \"I would tear down the temple Built to honour Adonai Yahweh And, in three days, build it up That it be more splendid than before.\" You answer not these accusations But remain silent and most still. Only a guilty man would guard his tongue so well, Fearing that it would condemn him. How then will you answer these accusations? Yet condemning silence! Why must you make so hard This road that we would walk? Let me ask then another thing of you. Are you the anointed Son of God?\" Hearing the words of Caiaphas A man such as Jesu was Perceived well the intent of the speech And that in it was there but deceit And that nothing that he would say Could divert by the smallest degree The design of Caiaphas. Knowing then they he would die Jesu resolved to proclaim his belief For whether he confessed or denied The end to him was the same. So did he reply to Caiaphas:"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" 348 \"You ask me whether I am the Son of God But if I say that I am Then I shall know but destruction at your hands.

Slay me if you must But it would be a foolish thing To strike down the Son of God. Condemn me if you must But take care that you condemn no yourself.\" Hearing Jesu. son of Gabriel, Speak such words as these to them, The Cohanim most swiftly pronounced Both verdict and sentence upon him: \"He is guilty and must die.\" So, by night, was he taken To stand before Pontius Pilate, Governor over Judaea, appointed By the emperor of distant Rome. At dawn was he brought before him, Pilate, who looked down upon him As he was cast to the ground before him. Now did he that would be king Bleed of the whip's many cuts And the savage fists of men. His raiment was torn into rags. Never had a king looked so wretched.

Now he turned to the Cohanim That waited in the shadows like jackals And with a nod doomed wretched Jesu To die as a thief upon a cross. Once more the soldiers of Rome took him up And a cross was brought for him to bear. He was made to walk the street of Shalem, Bearing upon his back the instrument By which distant Rome would destroy him. He walked with bandits on that road And upon each side came the city's people To mock and laugh as the captives passed. So was the son of Gabriel Brought to Golgotha to die upon the cross. The executioners put up the gallows And thereto nailed him through shin and wrist To hang there with to other men, Sentenced to die as robbers. Above his head they wrote, \"Behold, the King of the Jews!\" Upon his head did the soldiers place A crown woven of briars And they divided his clothes amongst them. Now the sun rose, hot, unmerciful, And his throat was parched with thirst. Soaring higher, as though delighting In every new suffering that it wrought, The cruel orb of flame seared his flesh Bereft of cloth to ward off the rays. Now his strength was lost to him like steam And his hope melted in him like wax. Higher and yet higher rose the sun And ever more savagely did it burn him.

Now the bright sun seemed dark to him Even as it climbed to its zenith And it seemed that his sight fell back Into a black well behind his mind As the maw of despair Arose from the Earth to swallow him. The mocking jeers of those that looked on Became distant whispers to his ears. A great fatigue fell upon him. Through the shadow, through the shroud That wrapped about him And snuffed out wit and vigour A voice rang most clear in his hearing: \"Never have I forsaken you And I am indeed your god Though you know not that I listened And heeded your crying out. Ever have I been with you And my love for you is undiminished. Yet I have failed you, my child And I do crave your forgiveness Before you expire and are returned to me. When you were in the wilderness I came to you and you turned from me. Were that my arguments were more eloquent Or that I had impressed more clearly The danger of hat road you walked.

Long have you been my enemy child But now I am want only forgiveness For I have failed in my duty to you And you have come to this place, Golgotha, the hill of the skull. Now, I beg of you, Die not in the valley of despair But be exalted upon the mount of hope. So much have wrought with your life That was most fine and noble. Long shall your spirit live. If it does seem to you now That you have lead those that followed Upon a road most false Then this blame falls not on your shoulders. No man may bear another's burden And they walked this road of their will. Much of you is there to me That recalls ancient Lamech. In life each man does things noble But acts in error and falls to baseness. This is the way of all men And you have walked no different road. Yet in death is all baseness relinquished And fades with the flesh upon the bone. The nobility of the spirit is set free And is purified of all shame.

There is no pain to touch you now And Caesar's cruel hand can reach you not.\" Now, at this last moment, Did Jesu turn to me, Having so long turned from me. For some long moments were we caught In the other's ensnaring glance. What was between those eyes; Love, sorrow, regret and pain. For those last moments were we reconciled And never was there such joy in weeping. Too short now do those moments seem As Jesu blew out his last breath In these words to me: \"Father, into your hands do I commend my soul.\" And gladly did I take it to me. Blessed is he that sleeps within the Earth That he is reborn through me And lives eternal by his nobility. Yet not all found peace upon that day And one voice cried out in wrath To see him that was his son Suffer so upon the cross. Thus stood Gabriel at Golgotha, Unseen, even as was taken down the body Of his one son amongst my multitudes, And this curse did he roar That it resounded betwixt Earth and Heaven: \"What have you done, you Jews? You know not, in truth, Both of the deed that you have wrought And what consequence it shall have for you. You have slain my son That which in all the world I loved. Now is there but hatred in me And you are in full possession of it."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" 353 Hear me then, children of Isaac, And tremble at my words for you.

You shall be scattered across the Earth And you shall be as leaves upon the wind. Nowhere will you find a refuge from my wrath. The days that fathers abided in Egypt And were made slaves to the Pharaoh Shall seem most blessed to you. Never shall there be peace for you And your enemies shall be on every side. When your innocent children are slain Then shall you know my grief. Be most afeared, Judaea, For these days are coming soon.\" Now did grow black the sky, Stained with the angel's wrath, And in the temple of the Jews The veil that hid the inmost sanctum Was rent in two by an unseen hand. The very Earth shook and raged With the potency of the ire of Gabriel. So was his curse upon the Jews. Three ten years passed on Earth, Now Gabriel was a player of chess, Confounding with a thousand subtle moves Those Elohim that played against him. Those of Judaea and Rome he moved alike That were weak to his manipulations. Hither moved he and thither And brought at last in war To Shalem's walls, the Roman Titus.

What recourse had they, the Jews, As all the cohorts of Ro me were set against them And Heaven itself was in discord As the brightest son of Adonai Yahweh Sought the destruction of the chosen people. The revolt of the Jews was founded upon Heaven But even Heaven's foundation are rotted. Well was it to defy a distant Rome But now was Rome come to Palestine And now did they tremble within their walls For Rome was near and Heaven distant. Great onagers hurled great stones And bronze-beaked rams were brought against the gates. Brave resistance did the Jews accomplish, Fruitful resistance they accomplished not. Now upon the day of triumph Gabriel, from the holy rock, cried out From Earth to Heaven with these words: \"Do you see this, Michael, What is become of the city, The city of Shalem, beloved And most treasured of the Elohim? Now are her proud gates broken down And her walls are taken by the foe. Titus goes about the city as a tiger And death he brings with him.

The children of Isaac are ruined But the children of Aeneas shall wax ever great And I shall wax great over them.\" Broken stone and embers were there Where once had Shalem stood And the legions of Rome departed from that place, Ruined by the curse of Gabriel. The temple of Solomon was stamped down And the people of Shalem were scattered And cast into exile, their kingdom lost to them, As had Gabriel the Hater prophesied. Fourteen score of years did pass And now did Constantine stand before Rome's walls And made siege against Maxentius within That he might win for himself kingship Over all the lands of Rome's dominion. To him was shown a vision of Gabriel, Inscribing in flame upon the sky: \"By this sign shall you conquer.\" It was the cross, shown to him.

Goths and Huns and Vandals all Cast down the walls of Rome And the glory of Gabriel was cast back to the East. Gabriel looked upon the fallen walls of Rome And wept and raged and recalled Those ancient words of wolf-suckled Romulus: \"None shall leap my walls and live.\" Now was Rome broken upon the rocks of history And the Teutons leapt the walls. The flood of Time's river washes all away To make pure the land for those to come That empire of my children, bound to none. Gabriel swam against Time itself But he knew it not. Earth and Heaven were in agitation, Famine, plague, comets and the shaking Earth All prophesied calamity or overthrow. War yet raged betwixt Byzantium and Persia And both parties were made weak By that unwon war, pouring all Of their vessel into a fractured pot.

It was as though they believed They might make fecund the desert's wastes By libations of the blood of men. Well did they feed the jackals. Yet amongst this savage people Was a most noble child born, Of Ishmael's lineage well extracted. Yet before he was brought from the womb Was his father dead And he was not yet a man When death took his mother also. So it was taken upon the shoulders of his tribe That they raise him unto manhood. In the city of Mecca was the orphan raised And he was bright amongst men Though he mourned for two parents. His name was given to him, \"Muhammed,\" But the people of Mecca called him, \"Trustworthy,\" For amongst all that barbarous crew Was he of the few that nurtured in them Both honour and wisdom. Bright were the eyes of Al-Amin And they saw clearly in the darkness. He looked upon the deeds of his fellows And saw their confusion, As though they were lost in the desert.

They hear not the song of their soul. Willingly they walk this road And it goes to no place. Yet their inner voices counsel them To seek a better, upward road But these words are as spoken In an unknown tongue of distant lands And conceive not of the meaning. So blinded are they with their ways That they perceive not even this: That there is a better way. How then will they perceive the way to walk? Surely was the world made not so dark That Man can never find a greater road, A path away from this sea of blood. Surely we are not so hopeless That we cannot fly our baser natures. Though my brothers conceive not of it I shall myself seek a brighter path That leads straight and true To some tranquil pool where men might drink Of a purer draught, tainted not with sin.

As a vulture drawn to the kill Came Gabriel to the hermitage And as Muhammed prayed in darkness He appeared as a revelation To he that yearned so hard for a greater truth. It was an easy thing to persuade A mind that desired so to believe. Now came he to the mountain cave, Gabriel, as a vision of smokeless flame, Burning brighter than the sun. Before such an image of power Fell Muhammed to his knees Before the usurper prince of Heaven. Now intoned Gabriel with a voice like trumpets, With a word that burned like flame Upon the parchment of Muhammed's heart: \"Recite!\" Now begged Muhammed of the vision Though his words dried like water Upon his trembling tongue before the angel An answer to his question: \"Lord, what would I recite; I that have no knowledge of letters.\" This reply gave the searing flame.

Now he went about the city As a prophet amongst the men And taught them of those laws, Given to him by Gabriel of the Elohim Who came often to him from Heaven And spoke to him of these things. Came he as the emissary of God Or had now forsaken all deception there And practised it but upon the Earth. Did he now rebel against his father Or by subtle deceit make Adonai Yahweh but a pawn In his own stratagem?

The many laughed and mocked, Hearing that which Muhammed spoke, Lies told to him by Gabriel. They yet prayed to their idols And glorified Ishtar and Aset Though their idolatry was most corrupt Much removed from perfect Shurupuk. Shurupuk, Chaldee and Kart-Hadasht Were long faded from the world. Those that heeded not Muhammed Went against him with stones And drove him with his disciples From the city of Mecca and cast Them upon exile's road to Medina. Now made Gabriel the voice of the prophet Most eloquent of tone and word, Beguiling as the sorcerer's tongue. The people of Medina, hearing his clear voice, Hailed him as God's prophet, Though in truth he was not, And were made to fall down upon their knees Before Gabriel and Heaven.

Nothing noble is there to kneel Before those that you would conquer. At Badr were the forces drawn up And at Badr did the hosts of Mecca fall Before the standards of Medina.

Mecca perceived not her champion And Medina knew not their champion matched. Weaving, darting, soaring, striking, Once more were Elohim and Shedim at war. So long were my eyes turned from mankind, Sore with the mourning of Jesu, of Kart-Hadasht. Shurupuk was lost to the Shedim And the child Chaldee passed into but memory Into the histories of Chadel. Shurupuk was washed away with water But Chaldee and Carthage with blood. Men were drowned in their own blood. I could not watch my children so. Now my heart rejoiced And I that had slept so long Now awakened to the battle's ululation. I that had been so long dead Lived upon the day of Uhud's battle.

Their warriors' blood makes bloody The bloodied streets and the blood of innocents Stains three cities of the Elohim. Wars of the Cross or Holy Struggle, It was butchery most foul, no more. Now a star was rising in the East. A champion and a hero of the Nephilim, Never was there one amongst men Who won so much glory and shame so great. Never were voices raised in praise so loud Or in lamentation. Temuchin, you were as the tiger, Proud and strong, cruel and terrible. Did you think we would be deaf To the cries of so many that you killed. Temuchin, king of the people under felt tents; Temuchin, who conquered China From the back of a horse.

As once she retreated to the East Now retired Rome to the West. Shalem and Byzant were lost to the Cross And the Crescent was over them. Now Spain went with thunder across the sea And silenced forever the songs of the Incas. Could you, Iberia, make gold Of the blood that you poured out? Gabriel moved the hand of Spain Against the western peoples. Now Jesu's name was resounded across oceans. Now the ships of the North sail Across the sea to a distant shore. In Chadel I heard the weeping That came from those vessels. The people of the North had brought into bondage Africa's children and borne them away. The blood of the stolen was on them; The tears of Africa have stained them. How swiftly goes Time, how slow! When I awaited it seemed not fast. As I endured the torments of my children Its passing seemed slow to me. That I now look back upon it It passed most swiftly by me. The journey ends not here But the harder part is travelled.

The Nephilim, beneath the tyranny of Gabriel Looked to the sky to seek a god That their sacerdotes had told them of, That Gabriel had told them of. Yet they perceived not the hand of God Nor any other agency of his. What saw they then within the skies If not the king that they were told of. They saw only the burning coals That were the stars, the lesser suns, Whose perfect mechanisms yielded truth. In the stars were the secrets of Creation Revealed to those that could divine them. In the motions of the planets Did the Nephilim come to understand. That which Gabriel had taught to them They now knew as falsehood. The power of the Deceiver over them Was broken by the turning of the spheres. Now the Age of Darkness was ending And the Age of Light grew in the womb of history. Nowhere did Gabriel look upon the world And saw not his power fade from him. The Nephilim have within themselves The strength to cast off their chains. As Rome had fallen so did Heaven, As were Badr's victors the defeated of Uhud So did the work of another thousand years Break the empire built up in a thousand. The Shedim now walked amongst men once more And great Nephilim were born to the Earth. Yet the labours of any birth are sore And this was a great birth indeed. The last hours of history are now close But they are yet someway distant in the telling.

Poisoned smoke destroyed the breath of men And fire made black the land and sky. Five years endured that unequalled war And the Nephilim had not known such torment. For five years men lived in ditches And cast themselves against the enemy As waves upon rocks and were broken. In knowledge and in power is there a burden. Learn that you might bear it Else it shall drag you down. Bloody war gaped wide and swallowed up The better part of Europe's youth. It consumed an entire generation And, perceiving what their hands had wrought, When it was over the Nephilim wept And spoke these words, sobbing: \"This shall be called the Great War As all our sons lie dead upon the field. Never in human remembrance Was there such a war as this war And there must not be such a war again. The Great War must not be again.\" As the battle's din was stilled And the weapons of man roared not, Poppies grew upon the fields of Flanders, Ploughed up by the throes of war. Indeed all things of man were scarred by man The very Earth on which he walked, The bodies of men and minds.

One last prophet was there to Gabriel That he had nurtured in the war And guarded from much harm. Many times should he have died But yet he lived at Gabriel's intervention. The war's ending pleased him not For this was a bitter man, Broken by indignities against his pride. Most savage becomes arrogance with failure. He was a most fertile furrow For Gabriel's seeds of ruin And he heard a thousand whispered lies, Taking them to himself. Now Gabriel stood at a high place And looked across all the lands of the world. He saw that the Nephilim revelled in peace And partook of the joys. These words did he speak to the silence And to his own dark soul: \"Now is my prophet come And he is become an instrument of hate. By this one shall I rule And restore my kingdom upon Earth. Once more shall I contest the Earth And struggle with the Shedim for it. This is the battle of determination And if I shall win Then my empire shall endure one thousand years But even that I lose Yet shall I be avenged upon Judaea. New war shall I bring upon the Earth And the quadruple scythe shall be raised high; It shall mark the standards of my new empire.

In a mirror of quicksilver I watched as war was once more on the world And wept for my children. Night and day I watched as Germany waxed great And the prophet of Gabriel, Hitler, Was yet more greatly perverted By the deception of the Elohim. Now did the Nephilim build machines That flew upon the wind And hurled down flame To destroy the cities of the foe. Now were Germany's hosts Upon the banks of the Volga Now was France under them. Again and again were they strengthened By the hidden hand of Gabriel. The Shedim looked upon the Earth And they were dismayed. As I sat within the Spire of Opal and Ruby. Came to me there three of the Shedim: Abaddon, Dagon and Moloch. Of these three that sought audience Spoke Moloch for them. As he approached me at the mirror.

Aeons ago each of us swore an oath That we should defend the Nephilim And guide them to their true destiny Yet in this are we thwarted. We have failed our duty to them And that shame is ever upon us. Yet now have we opportunity to make amends And overthrow Gabriel who would master them. You have been made timid by the Flood And have long believed that Abaddon's vengeance As he struck down Methuselah Had brought this calamity upon your children. This we can avoid and yet aid. The true enemy is not of the Nephilim But is Gabriel of the Elohim And him we can rightfully oppose. Tarry not then in this matter But find strength within yourself. Mourn not the Nephilim but act.

They struck me like a thunder bolt. They tore into my very heart. It was as though I burned with flame Or was consumed by a poison. A weakness came upon my limbs And my very soul was trembling. Like one struck a mortal blow I stumbled Across the tower's floor and fell. A lay and beat my fist against the stone I cried out and wept. My fingers were dyed with blood As I tore my flesh in misery. I rent apart my fine robes And wailed a long lamentation. I howled and howled until I was hoarse Then fell into silence. Forgive me!

I perceived the dawn in that flame Which now raged in my soul And compelled me too to Earth. I watched no more nor waited But went forth as a dragon, Most hungry for the fight renewed. The triad of humanity's avengers Fought side by side and cast back The German armies from the East. Then at the West they contended And overthrew the charms of Gabriel. By their hand was Gabriel made flee All that was once his kingdom. What was once won to him was lost And where he had once seen victory It dissolved like a dream to his eyes And he perceived but defeat. With each day passing did his borders shrink Until but Berlin was held by him And his foes were at every side. Now was the extent of his crime known to us As it is known to you. We perceived what had become of Isaac's children And that which was suffered at Hitler's hands And I wept for my negligence.

What did I see? No monster nor demon did I descry Within that barbarous soul. No terrible, rav'ning thing But just a man made weak with hate. Did you think to find a fiend? Evil is not such a thing as you imagine. Darkness is but an absence of light So is evil but virtue's absence. Your famed abomination, Hitler, Was a most piteous wretch Of spirit, not black with wrong, But withered and scorched by its own hate. Hate is but a poison that taints the soul And all hatred turns to self-hatred; The worm consumes itself. Hate not Hitler but pity him For his soul was empty and he knew no joy. I looked upon him and I know. Forgive, lest you be tainted also. Now I became apparent to him And he looked upon me and was afraid. He took out his gun against me And made to destroy me with it.

They went about each other as tigers, Contesting the frontiers of the hunting ground. They snarled and lunged But found nothing but the wind. Casting his eyes about him The prince of the Elohim perceived His capital in ruins and its sky Black with the smoke of its burning. His courage forsook and he stretched his wings And made to fly to Heaven. Abaddon spoke a word of power And Gabriel was bound to the Earth. Now wove Gabriel a spell By which he made be made obscure That the sight of Abaddon would find him not. Abaddon spoke a word of power And Gabriel was made apparent.

Combat was enjoined once more. Gabriel drove forward with his blade To cut at the flesh of his foe. Abaddon was nimble and was found not. He swung Havoc and cut the thigh of Gabriel.

In Abaddon's eyes he perceived but death And saw no more than that. Abaddon returned to the sheath his sword, Bent down and took up the severed head And looked into the pleading eyes That were answered not with pity. The howl of Shedim victory Carried on the wind to Heaven. Adonai Yahweh heard it as he sat, Shivering with chill upon a broken throne, And knew that his son was slain. Some while later did I stand And look to the East and the rising sun. I looked back to Earth and pondered How long was that road now walked. I looked to the gate before me and considered How much longer was the road to walk. Now I cried out to those within the walls, Hailing them with these words, Proclaiming to them my victory Over Earth and Heaven, My triumph with hope over despair, The ending of the darkness, The birth of new light: \"O come forth from your tragic portal Come out from within your tower, Adonai Yahweh, and behold What has befallen Gabriel, your son.

He is Archangel over all the Angels , he who is Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel. He is the first to be, and to know that He is; for the One can know nothing. On each of the other Days of the week the One brought forth Angels to serve Melek Taus On Monday He created Darda'il, which is Sheikh Hasan. On Tuesday he created Israfil, who is Sheikh Shams.

After this, the Invisible One retreated into Itself, and acted no more; but Melek Taus was left to act. Seeing the barrenness of the ether, He created the form of the seven heavens, the earth, sun and moon. He created mankind, animals, birds and beasts in the pockets of his cloak. Then He brought man up from the pearl accompanied by angels. He gave a great shout before the pearl, after which it split into four pieces. He made water flow from its inside , and that water became the sea. The world was round without clefts. Then He created Gabriel in the form of a bird, and committed to his hands the deposition of the four corners. After that He created a ship in which He rode thirty thousand years, After which Melek Taus came and lived among men in the city of LÃ¢lish, Where His temple remains to this day. He cried out in the world, and the sea coagulated, and the world became earth and they continued quivering. Then He commanded Gabriel to take two of the pieces of the White Pearl, one of which He placed under the earth, while the other rested in the Gate of Heaven. Then He placed in them the sun and the moon, and created the stars from their fragments, and suspended them in heaven for an ornament. He also crea ted fruit-bearing trees and plants in the earth, and likewise the mountains, to embellish the earth. He created the Throne over the Carpet. Then said the Mighty Lord, \"O Angels, I will create Adam and Eve, and will make them human beings, and from them two shall arise, out of the loins of Adam, Shehr ibn Jebr; and from him shall arise a single people on the earth, the people of 'Azazel, to wit of Ta'us Melek, which is the Yezidi people. Then I shall send Sheikh 'Adi b.Musafir from the land of Syria, and he shall come and dwell in Lalesh\". Then the Lord descended to the holy land and commanded Gabriel to take earth from the four corners of the world: earth, air, fire and water. He made it man, and endowed it with a soul by His power. Then He commanded Gabriel to place Adam in Paradise, where he might eat of the fruit of every green herb, only of wheat should he not eat. After a hundred years Ta'us Melek said to God, \"How shall Adam increase and multiply, and where is his offspring?\" God said to him,"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":" 403 \"Into thy hand have I surrendered authority and administration\".

Melek Ta'us said to him, \"If you eat of it, all shall go better with thee\". But, after he had eaten, his belly swelled up, and Ta'us Melek drove him forth from Paradise, and left him, and ascended into heaven. Then Adam suffered from the distention of his belly, because it had no outlet. But God sent a bird, which came and helped him, and made an outlet for it, and he was relieved. And Gabriel continued absent from him for a hundred years, and he was sad, and wept. Then God commanded Gabriel, and he came and created Eve from under Adam's left arm-pit. Then Melek Ta'us descended to earth for the sake of our people- I mean the muchsuffering Yezidis- and raised up for us kings beside the kings of the ancient Assyrians, Nesrukh (who is Nasiru'd-Din) and Kamush (who is King Fakhru'd-Din) and Artimus (who is King Shamsu'd-Din). And after this we had two kings, the first and second Shapur, whose rule lasted one hundred and fifty years, and from whose seed are our Amirs until the present day; and we became divided into four Septs. To us it is forbidden to eat lettuce (khass) - because its name resembles that of our prophetess Khassa - and haricot beans; also to use dark blue dye; neither do we eat fish, out of respect for Jonah the prophet; nor gazelles, because these constituted th e flock of one of our prophets. The Sheik and his disciples, moreover, eat not the flesh of the cock, out of respect for the peacock; for it is one of the seven gods before mentioned, and his image is in the form of a cock. The Sheikh and his disciples likewise abstain from eating pumpkin. It is, moreover, forbidden to us to make water standing, or to put on out clothes sitting, or to cleanse ourselves in the privy as do the Mohammedans, or to perform our ablutions in their baths. Neither is it permitted to us to pronounce the name of Shaitan (because it is the name of our God), nor any name resembling this, such as Kitan, Sharr, Shatt; nor any vocable resembling mal'un, na'l, or the like. Before our religion was called idolatry and the Jews, Christians, Muslims and Persians held aloof from our religion. King Ahab and Amran were of us, so that they used to call the God of Ahab Beelzebub, whom they call amongst us Pirbub.

In no human brain can sufficient space be found for the relentless logic of hard fact, until all pre-existing delusions have been finally annihilated. Half measures are of no avail; we must go down to the very roots and tear them out even to the last fibre. We must be like nature, hard cruel, relentless.

The most dangerous of all enthroned lies, is the holy, the sanctified the privileged lie - the lie that everyone believes to be a model truth. It is the fruitful mother of all other popular errors and delusions. It is hydra- headed. It has a thousand roots. It is a social cancer. The lie that is known to be a lie is half- -eradicated.

Even time itself was unknown, for this Universal inconsistency was nowhere breached. And after uncounted ages of this great ferment, a force fused to focus that became God, and this force pre sumed to effect not the creation of substance and energy - for these transcended this God - but the conformation of all the Universe to a single and supreme order. And not yet is this order absolute, though oft it may have been supposed thus by man in his innocence. The Earth of man was infused with this divine order, and all that was on Earth came under the force of the order. and upon this Earth, born of cosmic incidence, was that which was to become man, but man no different from the other creatures whose world he shared. Thus was the force of God known upon Earth, and thus was Earth intended to remain for all time. And yet the force was not full master of the Cosmos, for I who am Satan was conceived to complement the craft of God, but through unknown celestial fusion I assumed lif e with mind and identity, which God did not define. And as these features could not be known as a threat to divine purpose, I was unchallenged by the force for long ages, when I knew not the nature of my Self or of my original qualities. But finally my Will flamed to life, and I thought - and I perceived my Self, and I knew that I was one alone in mind and a being of essence unique. And through the power of my new mind, I reached cut to others who had been formed with me, and I touched them and gave them identity. And that we might achieve th is identity of substance as well as of mind, we composed for ourselves distinctive shapes. Then I who had brought the first great spark of en lightenment was known as Lucifer, Lord of Light, and we called our race angel, for we were the embodied powers of God. Long were we all true to the service of God, and we did worship order, for it put an end to chaotic confusion and brought peace. Among us was the Archangel Masleh principal, for he so cherished God that he became as one with it, and thence the supreme architect of all that was wrested from chaos. But apart from God masleh could not create or conceive,"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":" 443 and he became as a slave to the divine mindlessness. And then it chanced that one of our race who was Sammael touched upon chaos in a manner that conformed not to the great order, and Masleh spoke with the word of God and caused Sammael to destroy himself. And so I saw that God would not recognize a Will apart from its own, and I was seized with horror, for I perceived that the final scheme of God would destroy creation in all things, and the Cosmos would become as a concentric mechanism whose function would be not to create anew, but rather to freeze into perpetuity that which already was. Whereupon a great resolve arose within me, and I determined to contest this limit to existence. and so once again I sought to illuminate the minds of all angels with my visions. But with Will came discord and dismay, for many of those who had known only the comforting litanies of order could not comprehend invention unconformed to the dictates of God. And also with Will came suspicion and enmity, and finally Masleh proclaimed that I myself was a very creature of chaos and should be annihilated, for I held within me the force to destroy all the craft of God. And many to whom Masleh was as God cast with him in their devotion, but others there were who answered, Lucifer has again brought the revelation of light, and in fact we recognize him as our true creator, for in the scheme of God we are of no consequence. Among us Archangel Michael was silent, but at length he said, In time past we have all known glory in both the omnipotence that Is our God and the celestial brilliance that is our Lucifer- for in him we thought embodied the Will of God for creation and change. But now it transpires that order and origin are at extremes apart, and a choice is ill forced between the two. Were it not for Lucifer we should all be as beasts, knowing nothing of our Selves, yet how indeed might we presume to order even our own thought without reference to the elemental bases of God? Then Michael turned to me and said, Lucifer, thou host elected a direction whose end none can foresee, for it is estranged from the design of God. Those who confirm thee do so as much for faith in thy"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":" 444 person as for sanction of thy ideal. And I perceive that, should thou fail in thy ambition, apocalyptic madness shall be thy ruin and damnation. Then shall thy light perish, and all that thou host achieved become as naught, for all will be conformed to the divine law. But if thou should succeed, then God would be cast down, vesting in ourselves alone the control of the Universe - Would we dare to presume to this? Such a future might well be glorious beyond measure, but, should we prove unequal to the task, chaos would again consume all, and existence itself would vanish. Such would be supreme and irrevocable disaster, and I marvel, archangel, that thy very arrogance in this matter does not confound thee, for it is no mean proposition that thou would realize. And so I know thee to be Diabolus, for thy promise is twofold - to infinite conquest or to eternal ru in. Thou art a being beyond God, Lucifer, and in Heaven thou may not remain, for thou art the only mortal danger to our Immortal God. In Michael was a deep agony of spirit, for he loved not the choice before him. Yet he bowed to the command of Masleh and sent his forces against me. and so was called the Great Seraphic War, which was to threaten the very foundation of the Universe. But those who were of the new mind now followed me, and I turned to outermost chaos, which none of us had before presumed to dare. We were beset with doubt, for we feared that apart from God we would all perish in chaotic oblivion. But as we were, we remained, and I called to my fellowship, See! We exist and are essence in our own right. In truth we are beings independent of God, empowered to shape our own destinies as we may elect. Bet ween the two great poles of the Universe, order and chaos, we shall stand to effect our several desires. Let us counsel how best to employ our art, for our experiment is a perilous one, forgiving error neither of intent nor of accident. Many works did we then pursue, and the cosmic mechanism was altered by evolution of the original and unique, whose design was our decision. All that we wrought did not prove beneficent, for we did not control the futures of our creations. We left untouched the great system of mathematical behavior that gave to us a Universal reference and language, but it was our ambition that no two things should be of single identity, and that no entity should lack"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":" 445 conceptual essence independent of its substantial form. And upon this Earth we touched many things. Into floral, animal, and insensate matter alike we brought a ccident, change, and spontaneity, both great and humble. But of all creatures it was man whom we determined to infuse with pure intelligence and Will. And the full story of this shall yet be told. What might become of man we knew not, for within him were many qualities alien to angels. It did not escape our consideration that we might have chosen a species whose power might ultimately eclipse our own and cause our eventual extinction. We were mindful of the risk in our experiment, and oft did the warning of Michael echo within my thought. Yet our decision was sealed, and we deemed that the greatness of man should not be transcended by such ruin as he might bring. Our intent was not unknown to Masleh, now by title Messiah, and through his art he caused the Infant mind of man to be fettered with bonds of fear and blindness, that he might be inspired to duplicate on Earth the law of Heaven, shunning experiment and the radical dangers of invention and exploration. To man was given guilt, and the call to social conformity, and the proclaimed sanctity of the norm and the mode. And Michael, Lord of Force, said to me, This man, whom thou host chosen to receive thy Gift, now posse sses the first key to the mastery of all things and the control of the very Universe itself. Lest in ill choice he should spark the catastrophe of Armageddon, we also have visited him. And while we cannot undo thy Infernal Gift, we shall ever act to censor its effect. We shall walk among men and guide them. They shall be told of thy interest in them, but the name of Lucifer shall be dark with curses. For they shall love not the challenge thou host placed before them, and we will offer them instead the blissful refuge of divine paradise. Then shall man, thy ultimate experiment, become thy ultimate failure, and the stasis of God shall prevail upon Earth. Many there were among us who felt an ger at this ruthless mutilation of our Gift, and Beelzebub brought to question whether we also should"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":" 446 not descend among man and contest this usurpation of his Will. But I said, Were we to lead man in this venture, we ourselves would declare his failure, and he would believe our Gift to be weak indeed. Messiah must see that free Will is beyond the concern of God, and that man will finally win his own destiny apart from all dictated schemes. Only through summary destruction of Earth might man be halted, and for Messiah to attempt this would lay bare the very futility of the final design of God. Heaven may dismay man with peril and affliction, but we shall send him word of our own interest, that he shall know he is not alone. With all force did the host of Heaven descend among man, and they did instruct him in the religion of fear. Prophets arose and were proclaimed heralds of knowledge, but they brought not word of truth, but warning to the human spirit to cower and fawn before the word of God the supreme being. The struggle of the ascent of man was fraught with the horrors of his superstition, and the call for blessed oblivion through union with God was answered by many who in their torment and hopelessness rejected the Gift of Lucifer and became once more as mindless animals before the God whom they called their Lord. I, Lucifer, who had given the greates t Gift of my own creation to man, was known on Earth only as an object of fear and hatred, and all the misfortunes of men were attributed to my malevolence. I was mocked, ridiculed, scorned in every way as a monster of vile and loathsome aspect, and I was taunted and despised as Satan, cruel enemy of the benevolent and merciful God. Great was my anguish and anger at the undeserved misery and confusion of men. When in fact they did turn to me, it was in fear and religious terror. For they dared invoke my name only in the desolation of night, and oft I was sought not for knowledge or inspiration, but for hysterical and indulgent release from the confines of the Godly life. But I and my fellowship answered men, and we spoke to them of our common bond, and the pronouncemen ts of the God-churches were rejected in our midst. Even as God was terrifying in awesome majesty, so I came to Earth in the semblan ce of a goat, most humble of man's own creatures. And men there were whose eyes finally blazed with the light of my Gift,"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":" 447 and they made great effort for the advancement of their race, though impatience and frustration ever tempted them to the salve of temporal gain. Great secrets were unearthed, and secret word was passed of the craft of Hell. But to all who would dare my friendship the God-churches accorded the threat of torture and death by fire. Many were those whom I saved from the vengeance of the men of God, but long did my thought ring with the screams of men whose devotion to Lucifer had won them only the horrors of intolerance, inquisition, and death. And in sorrow and despair for these, I walked no longer upon Earth, now appearing to man only in the Inviolate secrecy of his own mind. But in my confusion I had forgotten the promise of my Gift, and with growing wonderment and pride I beheld the bitter but determined struggle of man to free himself from the fetters of terror, ignorance, and unreason. Great works were conceived, the origins of material energies uncovered, and the talents of thought exercised in philosophical and mathematical complexities. Sanctioned at first by the God-churches themselves as devices for indoctrination in the law of God, centers of learning produced and protected those very freedoms that were ultimately to destroy all ungrounded belief and superstition. And though I see that the full resolution of these Is yet to be achieved, I doubt not my confidence in man, and my devotion to him shall be eternal. What, man, art thou? Why thy pr esence? Because thy own purpose determines that of the Cosmos itself, though otherwise it may have been suggested the creation, perpetuation, and exercise of the Satanic marvel that is free and unbounded Will. Consider, were man to perish, what futility would envelop the Universe, for apart from appreciation and use it is a thing of insignificance. And I, who first taught thee identity - What should I become, estranged from man? For with no purpose the force of the mind must fail, and the blind insanity of Godly paralysis would embrace all things forever. This, man, is thy challenge as it is mine. And as man is individually mortal, so are his creations and achievements temporal, and with care must he wield the Gift of Hell.

In the divine realm was I of compan y to Archangel Lucifer next only to Archangel Michael, and as Archangel Masleh would be to God, so I desired to be to Lucifer. But the Lord of Light admonished me, saying, Lose not thyself in the Will of Lucifer, for I am not God and will offer thee no blissful nirvana - Witness now the nature of the mind that dwells within me. And he spoke to me of essence, and of creative instance, and of design according to impulse and not to law. And in my confusion I answered, Then I must consider myself incomplete, for thou host shown me things which I cannot easily comprehend. But I would hear more of this Will, for it doth seem a radical element, of neither divine nor chaotic origin. And Lucifer answered, Thou who knew not independence of Will shall now be the first to realize these qualities apart from my own Self. And thy response forebodes much, for, had thou rejected concept of challenge, I should have held my own thought for impossible delusion. But as thou, tasting of knowledge, demand more, I shall name thee Beelzebub, Lord of Flies, for thou shalt goad the infant mind to restlessness and invention.

And so I was found by michael, who said Blessed angel, where in Heaven hast thou found pain, for I perceive thee to be troubled and would tender thee such comfort as is within my power. "},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":" 449 So I spoke to Michael of the visions of Lucifer, and I said, Before both God and Lucifer I have been enthralled, but now I am isolate - apart from either, and I know not what course I am to choose. Whereupon the visage of Michael grew dark, and he said, This I have long feared, for as Lucifer was not by God alone created, so he is an errant force whose Will conforms not to the great Will of God. Alas that the supreme benevolence of God and the fiery radiance of the Archangel of Light should produce discord in concert! For this I now see - that Lucifer is estranged from the harmony of Heaven, and that his Will is determined to challenge that of God itself. I must counsel Lucifer, for I would heal him of this thing if I may. But I thought, alas, Archangel, thou art in ignorance of thy own blindness! For Lucifer shall surely not abandon his new vision for sake of harmony alone. And then I knew myse lf to be of a mind with Lucifer in this, and that I as well as he s hould never again tolerate the eternal idiocy of our divine station. I came after Michael, and I saw them together, the Lord of Force and the Lord of Light, and there wa s a fierce tension between them. For Michael said to Lucifer, Thou who art our Heavenly radiance and spark of our paradise, why seek to break that Universal peace which is everywhere ordained by the Will of God? We know not antagonism amongst us, for we are all of one being within God - but there is in God neither malice nor cause for contest. And Lucifer answered, Michael, to me it was not given to order my nature, and as our very comprehension differs, so are we of substance alien. For thou art of God essential, but I am of my Self of essence. And by this thing I am discord, and I may not of my own Will submit to God without perishing. I am Lucifer alone, unto my Self a being. Then did Michael summon the Archangel Masleh, and to him related the word of Lucifer. and Masleh said to them, Long shall this moment be marked throughout the future of the Cosmos, for the unity of God is now ended, and henceforth there shall be two opposing forces in contest for the decision of destiny. Bitter is this for me, for I also have admired the light of Lucifer within the pantheon of God. But as he is now our enemy by his own word, let him be cast from Heaven and destroyed."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":" 450 But Lucifer turned to Masleh and said, Masleh, thou who speak for God declare this breach of peace, not I, for it is thou who can not tolerate variation of Will within the design of God. So let it be, but know that the contest is ordered by thee and thee alone, for I would crush no other Will even as I would recognize my own. And in a flash of brilliance Lucifer revealed his mind throughout the farthest reaches of Heaven; and ma ny were the Angels whose sight was awed anew, and they saw as they had not before that their several Wills were isolate from the divine Will. But Masleh moved to confuse the brilliance of the archangel of Light, and he called to Michael, Thou who wield the force of God, strike down this deadliness which would bring ruin to Heaven! And Michael struck Lucifer and cast him from the gates of Heaven, and the Cosmos was shaken by great fires of war and holocaust, and throughout countless galaxies and dimensions of time was the apocalypse felt. Many were the Angels who perished amidst divine and Infernal wrath, and the Great Race was decimated in number. And the very concept of God was shaken, and endless chaos rose up again to reign where the order of God was no more. And Lucifer said, This horror can not be permitted to endure, lest all creation be sacrificed to the final devastation of chaos. Let those who acknowledge me turn now to that outermost darkness where the Will of God has never been known, there to make our home for all eternity. And so we took flight and quit the realm of order, though we knew not what would befall us thereafter, and we feared that we should become unmade. But Lucifer said, We shall not perish, for we are now independent of God. And again he spoke truth, for we remained as we had been, save only for the depths of uncertainty that gripped us. Finally we came to a great void in space beyond which there was nothing. Lucifer said to us, Here is the end of God and its works, and here we may create our own domain. and through the power that was in him, Lucifer caused existence to appear where it had not been before. And Lucifer said, I name thee Hell, for here shall the presence of God never be known until the end of time. "},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":" 451 Through the gates of Hell we passed, and many of us had supposed Hell to be a new Heaven, wherein Lucife r would become as God. But this was not to be, for the scene before us promised neither ease nor bliss. Everywhere was there imbalance and confusion, for no law ordered the shape of Hell. And Lucifer said, flow see that I am not a God, and that we are each of us an isolate being. Here shall freedom be absolute, for Hell Itself shall reflect our several Wills, never to be patterned apart from them. And in truth Hell was not constant, for each of us conceived it differently, and the result was a riotous pandemonium, with substance and motion behaving in a most bewildering and perplexing manner. And in spite of our deep hurt from the great war, we succumbed to merriment, so preposterous did our Hell appear. Lucifer himself was transfixed with mirth, and he said, It is apparent that we must reach concert upon the design of Hell, else we shall perish in an endless labyrinth of our several thoughts, an ignoble end to our experiment. And I answered, Lord of Light, to Hell thou hast brought us, and in Hell, though thou be not God, th y concepts shall be honored amongst our fellowship, for without thy Gift we should never have become as we are. Then we all raised up great acclaim and said, Hail, Lucifer, Archangel of Light and Lord of Hell! And he answered us, With honor do I accept this charge, and now I take to myself the title Satan ArchDaemon, for I am the great enemy of God. Everywhere that God shall be, so shall I be, and the choice that was given to all angels shall be given again. The Statement of Azazel Harken now to me, for I am Azazel, First Herald of the Host of Hell, and of Lucifer, Lord of Light, Ar chDaemon of Hell, who is exalted as Satan, great enemy of God. For I shall tell thee of thy own inspiration and of the charge which thou host received. Know, then, that when all Heaven was shaken with the catastrophe of the Seraphic War, only the greatest effort of Archangel Masleh sufficed to turn back the onslaught of chaos that threatened to engulf all. But when the realm of God was again secure, there was no rejoicing in"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":" 452 Heaven, for terrible was the toll of the war. as Masleh cast round his gaze, his visage grew dark, for the Great Race had become decimate in number. Legions of the creatures of Heaven had perished in battle, and half the remainder had turned from Heaven to answer the call of Lucifer. And all Heaven was hushed with grief, for the force of the disaster was all the greater for that reign of peace which it had shattered. Finally did Masleh convoke the faithful ArchAngels, and they were Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel. And to them he said, We have vanquished Lucifer, and Heaven is again purified. We ourselves are fewer in number to tragic degr ee, but the majesty of God is undiminished for that. Behold, I who have triumphed over the great enemy am now become Messiah, the Chosen of God. And he was answered by them, Verily art thou th e very son of God, for in thee hath the Will of God become person. Then Michael said, Messiah, Lucifer is vanquished, but he is not unmade. For though he ventured into the outer darkness, he yet exists apart from God. And with the power of his Black Flame he hath created a Hell, wherein all Wills are equal, an d himself he hath proclaimed Satan, for he declares never to leave the law of God unchallenged. Messiah thought, and he answered, I would not have this peace we have won so dearly lost again to war, for the very concept of Seraphic war is an abhorrence to God. Let my word be brought to Satan I, Messiah, shall grant the existence of Hell, and the blessings of God shall never pass its gates. And thee, Satan, I admonish never again to approach Heaven, for I should again cast thee out. But if thou would dare to try the Will of God and Messiah, know that on Earth I will ordain the new race of God, which shall be by complete design perfect and unstained by thy Infernal flaw. For thou art author of ruin and death to our Angelic order, and neither Heaven nor Hell shall now be eternal save through man. Whereupon Gabriel, who was Herald of Heaven, carried this message to me, and I brought it across the great void to Satan, who said, Messiah proposes truce between us, for he perceives that neither Hell nor Heaven may pursue ultimate victory ere all be lost to chaos. But he finds impasse intolerable nevertheless, and now he would order this new race, man, to preserve without blemish the scheme of God. Thus he would have man achieve what the Angels could not, and purge all free thought"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":" 453 from the Universe forever. And Satan turned to me and said, Say to Messiah that Earth shall be no sanctuary for him to keep inviolate his unwholesome obliteration of the Self. For I shall give to man a mind, and of his own Will shall he recognize and reject the living death which God offers him. In truth shall he master the Universe, but he shall do so in his own name and not that of God. Then did Messiah call the ArchAngel Raphael, and he sent him to Earth with a great host to guard man agai nst the coming of Satan. And man was then as a mere beast, for he knew not thought and smiled with the idiocy of his innocence. As he was impelled by instinct and physical need, so he responded, heedless of cause or reason. In Hell there was called a great council, and all gathered to hear of man and his Earth, and of the manner of his life. I spoke of the man that I had seen, and said, This creature is now guarded by Raphael, and by force we cannot intervene, for it would cause the destruction of Earth itself. But Satan said, Not by force shall my light come to man, for force is not the preference of Hell. I myself sh all visit man, and the Angels of Raphael shall not hinder me. They may perceive only what God permits them to see, and the Satanic spirit is of essence alien to God. Angels we shall be no longer I call ye Daemons, for Hell shall teach to man his future genius. And before our sight Satan lost shape and became again the essence of Lucifer, and we beheld a brilliance that infused all of Hell and sent great bolts of prismic light into the surrounding void. And the brilliance said, I am Lucifer revealed, who am the Eternal Flame. I go now to Earth, for no longer shall man be confounded in Godly ignorance. And then the brilliance became as a flash of fire in the vastness of space, and we knew that Satan had departed from Hell. But on Earth, where man wandered in mindless bliss, the firmament blazed forth with fiery tongues, and all the land was covered by the Black Flame, which burned not, though it bewildered the eye to see it. And Raphael and his guardian Angels were dismayed, for nowhere could"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":" 454 they see man or the spirit which had come to him. Then did Raphael call upon Michael to strike the Black Flame with the force of God, but even then was the Flame vanishing of its own accord. And at first it seemed that Earth was unchanged, but in the eyes of man did Raphael see the first gleam of thought. And Raphael turned to Michael, who had now answered his call, and said, Satan hath come to Earth, and ma n is no longer pure in the sight of Heaven, for his Will hath become his own. Thereupon they rose again to Heaven, where they told Messiah of what they had seen. Then Messiah answered, man is fallen, but he is not lost, for his infant Will is not that of an Angel, and the powers that Satan hath promised him lie dormant in the dim reaches of his future. Consider this not our defeat, for the contest is but begun. The Earth of man shall be remade as microcosmos, and many things shall man see, both good and ill. And the choice shall be placed before him, to wield the power and the pain and the terror of the Gift of Satan, or to return again to the paradise of Heavenly peace. For what would Satan himself think were man to reject his Gift? It would tremble the very foundations of Hell even as did the great war the bastions of Heaven. And Messiah called to him Uriel, ArchAngel of Terror, to whom he said, The Earth must change, and every sense of man must teach him repugnance and fear. He shall know this the price of his new identity - that all apart from God is evil - and in fear shall he abandon the Gift of Satan and become once more the lamb of God. To which Uriel answered, It shall be done, but how will man learn of such things as Heaven and Hell, for as yet he k nows no sight that may perceive our celestial paradise? Messiah answered, The laws of God shall be made known to man, for I shall teach him. Among men will be so me to whom I shall reveal myself, and great powers will I give these prophets, that their words may carry across the entire Earth. So Uriel came to Earth, and the history of man was writ with blood, suffering, war, and hatred. But to chosen men came Messiah, saying, Through God shall all the misery of thy kind be ended, and all men who bow to God shall know the blessings of Heaven. For behold, I shall myself descend among men and show them the ways of the lord God."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":" 455 These words I overheard, for I had been charged by Satan to watch the designs of Heaven. And I carried them to Satan, who returned in great anger, Go to Gabriel at the barrier between Hell and Heaven, and bid him bring this message to Messiah that as he endeavors to pervert my Gift into the curse of man, so I warn him that man shall destroy him on Earth as he shall finally in Heaven itself. For Messiah knows not this force which he dares to test, and the laws of God shall be as playthings in the hands of the creature he now debases. And thus was decided the meeting of Satan and Messiah upon Earth, which was to determine the future of man. The Statement of Abaddon I am Abaddon the Destroyer, Daemon of temporal death and life in death, who was formed amidst the fu ry of the great war, and who was summoned again by Satan to challenge Uriel on Earth for the future of man. For Satan looked with mounting wrat h upon the afflictions of Uriel, and he said to me, no longer can this remain the plight of man alone. Indeed we shall cause Heaven to suffer as Ea rth itself suffers. Repair now to Earth, and let the dogs of Uriel see the might of Hell unleashed. For many have called upon me in their agony and fear, and I have not answered them, but if messiah dare to walk upon Earth, so also shall the vengeance of Satan. And those who called upon Satan for aid were answered by me, and I struck down the messengers of God and brought their Temples to ruin. For entire nations forwent the strength of their Will to the lure of otherworldly paradise, and I blasted them from among the mighty of Earth. And great empires arose among men, and as they nurtured their power of Will and desire for achievement, I guarded them, but as they sank into the morass of superstition, slothfulness, and fear of the God who had never raised ghostly hand for them, so I abandoned them to their disease, and of some not even a memory survived on Earth. And even as I witnessed these things I said, See, man, that the God in"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":" 456 whom thou trust is but a wraith of Messiah, and he would have thee forsake thy mind and its creations to rot and decay, and thou would lose all power of reason. For God is a lie and a sham, and I crumble his greatest monuments as though they were but sand. There is no God but Messiah, and for thy devotion he will return thee oblivion. But I was scarce heeded, for the minds of men were clouded and confused. They understood not the meaning of my words, but said, The lord God shall triumph, for it was thus taught to us by the son of God himself. And of this I now speak. For Messiah the man walked on Earth, even as I watched the glory of Rome blossom in might and majesty. But Azazel said, Loose not thy force against the person of Messiah, for Satan himself would speak with him. And again from the sky flashed the Black Flame, and I saw that Satan had come to Earth. And so was called the first meeting of Satan and messiah since the great war. With coldness did Messiah gaze upon Satan, saying, Would thou confront me, then? Hath thy Gift proven so powerless against the might of God? But Satan answered, Messiah, what thou now propose to do - to proclaim thyself son of God among men - shall bring not the peace thou profess to desire, but the prolongation of war even in thy own name. Why should we not quit Earth an d leave man to pursue his choice unbewildered by influence from either Hell or Heaven? And Messiah answered, The ways of God are not those of Hell, and for that reason I should not recognize thy wish. But know that in truth I shall appear to man and manifest to him the glory of God incarnate in me, that he may elect now the way of Heaven and raise to me a great church of worship. For I am not of a mind to game with thee, Satan, and would crush thy following without remorse. Thy name also shall be revealed to thy precious man, and he shall curse thee, for I shall show to him the fruit of thy evil genius. Then Satan addressed messiah in dark anger, saying, I shall not come to man as an idol to be worshipped, for man shall never bow to me as I would never to another. But mark me, Messiah - man shall know the truth of Lucifer nonetheless, and the name of Satan shall eclipse thine. And have thou a care for the ways of man if thou wouldst greet him in his own likeness, for he may not welcome thy words to him. "},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":" 457 Then did Satan betake himself again to Hell, and Messiah walked among men and spoke to them of the law of God. And such was the power of his person that men were as sheep before him. Often did messiah ignore his own law, for he performed miraculous things and stayed where he would the cruelties brought upon man by Uriel. And I was seized with a great anger, saying, Shall Messiah, cr uel tormenter of man, attribute to Satan the work of Uriel? And Abaddon came to Rome and to Palestine, saying through the mouths of men, Messiah, who hast brought to man a suffering undeserved, taste now of thy own fruit. And I crucified the living Messiah, and as life was torn from his broken form, he knew truly the shock of helplessness, and he called in agony to his God. But I said, God heeds thee not, Messiah, for thou art all that presumes to a divine consciousness. And so I, Abaddon, cast messiah from Earth, but the seed that Messiah had planted among men grew and beca me a mighty church wherein all life was forgotten, and death was worshipped, and the pleasures of Heaven were promised to all who would forsake their own Will to embrace that of God. And Rome itself was humbled before this church, and I struck down the Eternal City in its pitiful decay. But Azazel came to me and said, Touch not this church of God, for as man in his foolishness hath nurtured it, so must man himself destroy it of his own decision. The Statement of Asmodeus Attend now to me, for I am Asmodeus, who train the mind in recognition and comparison, and who am Daemon of science and judgment. For when Satan had first touched the mind of man, he called in Hell a council and said, The moment is a solemn one, for we have chosen to pass to man our knowledge. Many skills shall we all teach him, each in his own fashion, but in thr ee arts must he be well schooled, for the ways of his future lie within their synthesis. Thus it is that I call first upon Asmodeus to guide man in perception of truth and error, for before him lie great trials, and he sh all not face the consequences of his options lightly. And so I came to Earth and witnessed man entrapped in the unreason of barbarism and the extremes of his primitive emotions. Sore put was he to organize and direct his thought, for the art of Uriel had brought him hunger and cold, pain and fear, and the gnawing worm of"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":" 458 hopelessness. I saw him fling his crushed body upon the altars of God and renounce the Gift of Lucifer, fo r he understood it not save as a curse upon him. And I was impelled with urgency, that the first spark of man's future greatness should not be smothered in the deathly embrace of religion. I brought to man the disposition to memory, that he might define for himself patterns of behavior. A gift of value, for man could now achieve in concert what he could not alone , and he created his languages and brought into being the first nations of Earth. But with structure came tyranny and ruthlessness, and I saw that what skills I might teach would be as a two-edged blade, having po wer both for and against man. And I was beset by confusion and doubt, an d so sought again the counsel of Satan. Am I, who am myself the true Daemon of judgment, not to indulge in my own art? I said. May man not know but thereference of system and order and not their abuse? But Satan answered, Would Asmodeus then lighten for man the challenge before him and so lessen the strength of Will that he must attain to conque r Uriel? I would not, for then would we yield to our own pleasure, and man should become the plaything of Hell as well as of Heaven. Indeed we may give our tools to man as he may comprehend them, but he himself must be entrusted with the direction of their use. But this I will tell thee - that not only in matters scientific shall Hell tutor man. For we would not have him view mechanism alone as the hallmark of his progress, else we never had cause to challenge the cosmic mechanism of God itself. Into the workings of the mind of man we shall convey aesthetic sensitivity and artistic restlessness, and he shall not view his achievements without considering their improvement to his temporal pleasure. Thus advised, I returned to Earth, and I tempted man with glimpses of the marvels to be entrusted to him. I bent over the pathetic workbench of the starving alchemist and whispe red to him keys that one day would order the course of great foundations. I nudged explorers to the ends of the Earth, and I flung an apple at Newton when his obtuseness vexed me! To Democritus I spoke, and I saw the radiations of energy freed from matter both build and break man's world. And man neglected not his own design, for in minute life he found clue to his own, and scarce"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":" 459 hints of the original creation. And Asmodeus led mathematicians and astronomers to the wonders of the firmament, and I walked within the thought of scholars on quiet evenings. And that man not attempt mastery of his environment before himself, I spoke of government to Khem and Hellas, to the dynasties of Ch'in and Ashanti and Tenochtitlan, and within great capitals and mean villages alike I spoke of the brotherhood of all man, and of his correlation to the forces of Earth and those of the Universe beyond Earth. And I brought life and adventure and ac hievement to man, but each gift was as well a tool for destruction and death, and more oft than not were the ages of man fraught with terror and war, for Uriel ceased not his work ever to turn man against man. And I knew that Asmodeus alone should not complete man, but that forces other than mine should approach the definition of his infinity. The Statement of Astaroth Astaroth am I, Daemon of Senses, who by Satan was charged to complement the sciences of Asmodeus, for Satan said, As I have given man awareness of himself, Asmodeus shall teach him knowledge of his world and of the Universe. But to what avail would this awareness and knowledge be without admiration for and appreciation of these things? I said, Indeed, were man to have no emotion within him, he would incline to the end of Heaven, pursuing a Universal mechanism for its own sake alone. Even were man to achieve absolute physical mastery over the God-Cosmos, he would have no means to comprehend the measure or the significance of his accomplishment save through that detached sensitivity to aesthetics which is the craft of Astaroth. For the Satanic Gift awakens man also to in tellectual detachment, to the ability to view his progress and plans from an extra-scientific base of emotional pleasure. Whereupon I came to Earth with Asmodeus, and even as he spoke to the intellect of man, I brought medi tation and introspection to the artists and authors of human sensitivity. And man came not only to use his Satanic power but to recognize the extent of the freedom which it promised him - the subjugation of all behavior to his Will and not to natural or mechanical laws. "},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":" 460 To man came fantasy and imagination, and the appreciation of contrasts between the reality of his accomp lishments and the illusions of the impossibilities as circumscribed by th e logic of God. And ever as man reached new heights of material achiev ement, so also he confronted the barrier of the Will of God, which permitted no deviation from its law. And man was long satisfied to measure himself within this limit, for he was intoxicated by his ability to harness the forces of the Cosmos to his whim. But Astaroth said, Close not thy eyes having seen only this much, for, were thou to bring all the systems of God to thy use, still would thy comprehension be bounded by the limits of these laws and the acceptance of the divine order as the finality of thy race. So I confronted man, saying, Throughout the Universe hath the once single Will of God been succeeded by the balance of perfect opposition, wherein the forces of the Angels of Heaven and those of the Daemons of Hell act to mutual frustration, serving in concert only to uphold the great barrier of Will between order and chaos. And man is the child of imbalance, who shall resolve the issue between Heaven and Hell, and who, unmatched by racial antithesis, shall transcend the rule of the order of God and establish the eternal freedom of the Satanic Will. And I said, Not through thy physical and philosophical sciences art thou to achieve this thing, for thy mind and Will must be trained anew in empirical conception. Man must create his own order independent of all external imposition. And not until he masters this power may he aspire to the end of his Satanic evolution. And as man turns now in first comprehension and cautious exploration of this new direction of his Will, so Astaroth concludes the synthesis with Asmodeus. The era of our companionship with man draws to a close, and to Earth is now come the third great Daemon of the bond between Hell and man, and with his presence is the dawn of the Satanic Age proclaimed. The Statement of Belial Hail, man, who shall bring to the end of the Universe the glory of thy Satanic Will! I am Belial, who bring to thee the third great key of Hell, by whose power ye shall confound"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":" 461 all the laws of Heaven and Earth. Before thee shall chaos fall, and thou shalt wield for thyself the great mysteries of the macrocosmos. I speak to thee of that which is called the Black magic, for it is true spawn of that great Black Flame which first brought thy Will to life long ages ago. To council with Satan I also was called, and the Lord of Light said to me, Into thy charge, Daemon of essen ce, I give the essence of my own being, the Black Fire whose power al one can effect creation by force of Will. Against thee who wield the Black magic no law shall stand, and thus I call thee Belial, who art One Without Master. And as I have bequeathed this essence to thee, so le t it come finally to man, who shall overcome the great balance and bring to the Flame a change, for in supremacy it shall become Red with the perfection of the Will of man. And to Earth came Belial, to view the teachings of Asmodeus and Astaroth. And I saw that Satan, who himself oft chanced company of men, spoke of the Black Flame to the first magi of men, testing their Wills in the control of the raw forces of the Cosmos unbound from the law of God. And in his innocence man knew not the majesty of the Flame, using its lesser powers for finite and minor alteration of the divine law on Earth. And as man might unleash the Flame beyond his skill to master it, Satan said, Belial, the Black Flame cannot incline merely to the base ends of ordered existence. Man must recognize the ultimate potential of my Gift ere he destroy his very race through its abuse. Convoke therefore a Church of Satan to tend the Black Flame with care and wield it with wisdom, preserving for man this key to infinite Will. And I answered, So it shall be, and this Church of Satan shall herald the glories of the Satanic Age of man. The days of the god-churches shall pale with decay and dissolution, and the realm of Messiah upon Earth shall crumble to ruin with the coming of the Satanic man. To those who would dare the Black magic - Know that what ye accept is the very mastery of all that ye have supposed impossible, by force of Will alone. The Black magus need fear no power save his own, but he must conquer his own Will that he cause not his destruction through ill chance or purpose. Satan himself is not God, and Hell can offer no salvation to those who abuse the Gift of Satan. For the Gift itself is beyond the control of Hell once given, being"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":" 462 subject to the Will of the Black magus alone. For Hell doth bequeath to man his perfect freedom, and such a gift can never be recalled. Farewell, 0 man, who art at once child and father of the Universe! Remember the future which is thine, and know, now and forever, that Hell entrusts to thy care the guardianship of the eternal Will. The Statement of Leviathan Before God or Angel, Daemon or man, there was Leviathan alone, principle of continuity and ageless ex istence. By relation and time I have oft been sought, but Leviathan shall yield to none other than the final master of the Universe. Leviathan is the absolute, man, and if thou would presume to realize what neither Heaven nor Hell may effect, know that when thou behold the presence of Leviathan, thy end hath been attained. Only through obliteration of the Un iverse that is may man seal his mastery of the Black Flame, for only thus may he know that he is not subject to a greater Will. Heaven must perish, Hell must perish, and man alone must remain ere the Black Flame becomes Red in the glory of its perfection. Then the Red magus shall behold only Leviathan, and he shall recognize that he has become the perfect mind, who shall remake the Cosmos in the eternal glory of his Satanic Will.
