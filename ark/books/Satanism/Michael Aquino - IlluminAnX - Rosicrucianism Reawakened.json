Rational faith:law. The fundamental nature of reality ismysterious; this is a scientific fact In basingthemselves on mystery, religions are morescientific than rational philosophies.But there are mysteries and mysteries,and Christianity has foolishly tried toparticularize the fundamental mystery. Theessential and only mystery is the nature ofwhat the Christians call “God” or“ P r o v i d e n c e ” . B u t t h e c h u r c h h a sintroduced a fairground of pseudo-mysteries which have no relation to truth,but only to the principle that mystery haspower.Yet man is starved of mystery - sostarved that even the most futile enigmashave their power still. If no one will writenew detective stories, people will stillread the old ones. Virgin birth makesJesus unique; the mystery of this impudentuniqueness is so pleasurable that we cannotresist it.For every Christian who believes in allthe dogma of his church, there are athousand who half-believe because they feela man should believe in something. If theold religions survive, it is because they areconvenient receptacles of the desire tobelieve; and because they are, though poorones, ports; and because they at least try tosatisfy the hunger for mystery.- John Fowles, The Aristos- 8 -[index-9_1.jpg]- 9 -Table of ContentsDedication: James C.

Everyday life, the humancondition has no reality f0r you,because it’s uncertain, imperfect,transient. You have to have somegreat, immutable truth. You’re stilllooking for God’s truth, any truth,even a godless truth as long as it’sultimate, absolute, permanent,everlasting. You’re a Faust freak who’dsell his soul for the great truth. Well,human life doesn’t have truth. We’reborn screaming in doubt, and we diesuffocating in doubt, and human lifeconsists of continually convincingourselves we’re alive.- Emily to Edward JessupPaddy Chayefsky, Altered StatesA. Cryptic CredentialsThis book consolidates a series of four lectures,given earlier this year furtively and at great personalperil to premorphic participants of the EsotericOrder of Dagon at the Order of Dagon Hall inInnsmouth, Massachusetts. Innsmouth, popularlysupposed to be mere fictional invention of thesomewhat over-imaginative fantasy writer H.P.- 16 -Lovecraft, is actually a very real fishing village, in asecluded cove on Essex Bay, between Ipswich andRowley; the overgrowths of the surrounding GreatMarsh State Preserve obscure it from passing view,which is probably just as well.My association with the Order dates back to1988, when I was doing graduate research at andbelow Devil’s Reef in Essex Bay, for my doctoraldissertation at Miskatonic University’s Departmentof Metaphysics “V’naa-glyz-zai v’naa-glyz-zn’aCylth: Studies in Postmorphic Trauma AmongRecent Y'ha-nthlei Arrivals”. 1It proved to be an unexpectedly-tryingexpedition. Even getting access to the Reef had notbeen easy. No one in Massachusetts, it seemed, waswilling to charter a vessel to stand by for my dives inthat part of the Bay; I had to go all the way toCollinsport up in Maine to secure a suitable boat.Nor was the town itself particularly hospitable.The hotel where I initially took rooms - the GilmanHouse2 - was unacceptably drafty and noisy -particularly late at night, when the barking and1 A copy of this blasphemous abomination exists under lockand key in the Forbidden Collections of Miskatonic, but thelast two postdoctorals granted access to it were found crouchedin an alcove of the Reading Room the next morning, crooningtunelessly to themselves between hysterical shrieks. TheLibrarian suggests other research resources accordingly.The dissertation was approved, though my committeechairman retired immediately afterward, one of the other twoprofessors hanged himself in his office, and the thirddisappeared into the Catholic monastery at San Benedetto inSubiaco, Italy, where he raved incessantly about “the Daggersof Megiddo” and “Cassiopeia”.2 I had always supposed Lovecraft to have made up this nameas a pun for his The Shadow Over Innsmouth tale, so wasamused to see it as the hotel’s actual name.[index-17_1.jpg][index-17_2.png]- 17 -howling - and I don’t mean from dogs - wasincessant. So I wound up sleeping on the boat.The locals seemed increasinglysuspicious aboutwhat I was doing out at the Reef, until one day whenI was accosted, none too gently, on my way to thedock and invited to explain myself at the nearbyOrder of Dagon Hall:Evidently I acquitted myself: Not only was Ipermitted to leave alive, but to my surprise wasinvited to accept membership in the Order. Notbeing quite certain as to what might transpire if Ideclined, I accepted with pleasure. The conferral didinvolve some Nameless Rites and UnspeakableOrgies that lasted well into the evening, but once Istopped screaming, I decided that they were kind offun after all - and would add a touch more localcolor to my paper, if I lived long enough to write it.[index-18_1.jpg][index-18_2.jpg][index-18_3.jpg][index-18_4.png]- 18 -Indeed my dissertation was successful, and thedoctorate conferred later that same year back inArkham:- 19 -My research interests during the next twodecades were primarily in my other academicdiscipline of Political Science, and of course withingovernmental responsibilities in Special Operationsand Space Intelligence.It wasn’t until 2009 that I was able to pursuepost-doctoral work with Miskatonic: investigatingoptions for non-Setian/Satanic Western religions. 3It had long since become apparent that Setian/Satanic initiation is too dangerous for all but anElect few. With the large, traditional slave-religionsof Judaism and its Christian & Islamic variantshopelessly degenerate, might there be a Right-HandPath initiatory alternative comprehensible andbeneficial to most surface-humanoids?A research grant from the Starry WisdomEducational Foundation of Providence, RhodeIsland facilitated this project, and the largest suchorganization - the Ancient & Mystical Order RosæCrucis (AMORC) of San Jose, California - wasselected for examination accordingly.Before recounting the AMORC results, a bit morebackground concerning both the exclusionarySetian/Satanic options and the cultural influencesinspiring what is today generally known as“Rosicrucianism”:B. From Satan to SetIn 1966 Anton Szandor LaVey founded theChurch of Satan as a rejection of slave-religion,principally the hypocrisy of Judæo-Christianity.3 Excepting the Northern European Rune-Gild, which, whilenot exclusively aligned to Setian/Satanic principles, isnonetheless too sophisticated for masses’ comprehension orparticipation.- 20 -But there came a completely unexpected twist:Over the subsequent decade the Church evolvedfrom this extemporaneous “negative backlash” intoa positive religious philosophy in its own right, andin 1975 underwent evolutionary transformation intothe Temple of Set, restoring the key metaphysicalprinciples - the primal axioms - of ancient Egyptwhile simultaneously finally obliterating even theiconography of Abrahamics.In the forty years since that restoration, theTemple has never looked back, ascending to evermore exciting vistas of comprehension and precisionin phenomenological fields from the micro- to themacrocosmic.Setian initiation - enlightened self-awareness - isbased upon the principle of the separateness, theunique, ecstatic distinction of the individual sentientconsciousness from everything else: to what Setiansrefer as the “Gift of Set” 4.4 In later mythologies the Fire of Prometheus, the fruit of theEdenic Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the Nine Rings,the Grail. the Jewel of Seven Stars, the Flame of Kôr, theShining Trapezohedron ...“The iridescent spiral caught me above the heart;wrapped itself around me. There rushed through me amingled ecstasy and horror. Every atom of me quiveredwith delight and shrank with despair. There was nothingloathsome in it. But it was as though the icy soul of evil andthe fiery soul of good had stepped together within me.“The radiant Thing that held me gleamed andstrengthened. Its shining core had shape - but a shape thatmy eyes and brain could not define. It was as though abeing of another sphere should assume what it might ofhuman semblance, but was not able to conceal that whathuman eyes saw was but a part of it. Even as I found itshuman semblance it changed. And still the mingledrapture and terror held me.”- A. Merritt, The Moon Pool- 21 -It is this Gift which enables not only one’s self-definition, but also perspective upon the totality ofwhat is “not-self”, being both the “ObjectiveUniverse/OU” of matter & energy, and other non-OU sentient intelligences.Insofar as this point & power of perspectiveenables apprehension and comprehension of the 4Dimensions comprising the OU - length, width,depth, and duration - it is in a very real sense the“5th Dimension of Imagination” as artisticallycharacterized by Rod Serling for his classic 1950s’Twilight Zone television series.Each such isolate intelligence generates its own,unique picture of reality, defined by Setians as the“Subjective Universe/SU”. The OU is seen andinterpreted through the “lens” of a SU, butadditional SUs can also be created completelyextemporaneously: Friedrich Nietzsche’s “horizon-building”.Manifest totality thus consists of one OU and asmany SUs are there are entities to create them.The Temple of Set had apprehended andcommuned with the neter 5 of individual, non-5 The Egyptian hieroglyphic neter was later be abstracted intothe “Forms” of Pythagoras and Plato - both Egyptian initiates -and subsequently degenerated by ignorant humanity into meremyth-caricatures. Comments Sir E.A. Wallis Budge:This word has been translated “godlike”, “holy”, “divine”,“sacred”, “power”, “strength”, “force”, “strong”, “fortify”,“mighty”, “protect”; but it is quite impossible to be certainthat any word which we may use represents the meaning ofneter, because no one knows exactly what idea the ancientEgyptians attached to the word. The truth is that the exactmeaning of neter was lost at a very early period of Egyptianhistory, and even the Coptic does not help us to recover it.( The Book of the Dead, 1960)- 22 -natural existence, Set6. His was the primal, prior“design & activation” creative genius manifesting inthe multitude of separate, distinct, but similarly-constituted sentient beings.Phenomena cannot create and organizethemselves; in any particularized manifestation orcoalescence, a prior, external conceiving genius isnecessitated. Aristotle famously argued theexistence of the “Prime Movers” ( Primum Movens) -the Egyptian neteru:It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void,nor time, outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there,is of such a nature as not to occupy any place, nor doestime age it; nor is there any change in any of the thingswhich lie beyond the outermost motion; they continuethrough their entire duration unalterable andunmodified, living the best and most self sufficient oflives … From [the fulfillment of the whole heaven]derive the being and life which other things, somemore or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy. 76 Together with that of Horus [the Elder], the Priesthood of Setwas the oldest of the Egyptian priesthoods. Predynastic imagesof Set date to ca. 3200 BCE. The Egyptians’ astronomicalrecords indicate 5000 BCE. (Lockyer, J. Norman, The Dawn ofAstronomy. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1964, page #215) Throughthe XIX-XX [Setian] Dynasties ca. 1085 BCE, it existed2-4,000 years. “In the early dynasties,” observes Budge:Set was a beneficent god, and one whose favor was soughtafter by the living and by the dead, and so late as the XIXDynasty kings delighted to call themselves “Beloved ofSet”. After the cult of Osiris was firmly established and thisgod was the “great god” of all Egypt, it became the fashionto regard Set as the origin of all evil, and his statues andimages were so effectively destroyed that only a few whichhave escaped by accident have come down to us.( The Book of the Dead)7 Aristotle, De Cælo, I.9, 279 a17–30. In the medieval eraCatholic theologian Thomas Aquinas would singularize thisconcept as his proof for the existence of El.- 23 -C. Creators of the Objective UniverseOf crucial importance to an understanding of theOU is not just its existence and regularity, but thereason why this regularity exists as it is, and why itis enforced in this configuration instant to instant.As Aristotle realized, the whole of the OUnecessitates a prior genius to conceive, establish,and to continually compel its order andconsistency. This is the collective, interrelatedgenius of the natural neteru, whose existence is notmerely proven but necessitated by the ObjectiveUniversality of what is commonly called “NaturalLaw (NL)”.This “Necessity Supreme” 8 cannot be ignored.Absent the neteru there is no explanation for theOU’s existence vs. nothingness, for the almost-unimaginable intricacy of its constituent elementsand their interaction, and for the instant-to-instantidentity of these. Absent them there would simply bechaos in all OU phenomena, if indeed the OUexisted in whole or part by mere happenstance.The question follows: If the neteru exist and areprior to manifest existence, how did they come toexist?Doesn’t this simply ratchet the problem of“Creation” up one notch, leaving us with the samemystery?8 as James Thomson was ravished by its realization in his epicThe City of Dreadful Night (1874):I find no hint throughout the UniverseOf good or ill, of blessing or of curse;I find alone Necessity Supreme;With infinite Mystery, abysmal, dark,Unlighted ever by the faintest sparkFor us the flitting shadows of a dream.- 24 -The answer is at once obvious and alien tohumans’ accustomed way of thinking, and it has todo with the concept of “time”.Time (as the Fourth Dimension) is anexclusively-OU phenomenon: a measurement ofchange occurring relative to two or more OU-objectsor -energies. It is nonexistent, meaningless in theSU.The neteru exist in their respective SUs,from which they generate and correlate the OU.This is, precisely, timeless. As such, there wasnever a “point in time” for their Coming Into Being,nor for their time-endurance. They simply are, ormore comprehensively in the Egyptian hieroglyphic,Xeper.Why should humans apprehend the neteru as amultiplicity [“gods”] instead of a singularity[“God”]?To some extent there neither is nor need be ananswer to this, as the complete OU-expression of theneteru is internally harmonious. How this harmonyis achieved is unresolvable by reason (Platonicdianoia).However there is a compelling argument formultiplicity, and it is once again the existence of Set:a neter completely distinct from and alien to thenatural neteru.A “divine singularity” would preclude such anexclusion; therefore what exists other-than-Set, tothe extent that it is indeed integral and harmonious,implies, if not indeed requires multiplicity.Beyond this, as the Egyptians, Pythagoras, andPlato also acknowledged, the neteru are notdiscernible through algorithmic reasoning withinthe mechanisms of the OU (the aforementioneddianoia), but only through the higher faculty of- 25 -intuitive apprehension: nœsis. This is a supremely-refined and -disciplined mental process achievedthrough the exercise of the Dialectic; it is not merephantasy or dreaming [though both of these arelesser manifestations of the mind’s suprarational,Setian capabilities].To the Egyptians, all of the OU is actively-alive: the direct consequence of the wills of theneteru. Nature was intelligible not just throughinanimate, automatic, general regularities whichcould be discovered via the “scientific method”; butalso through connections and associationsbetween things and events perceived in thehuman mind. There was no distinction between“reality” and “appearance”; anything capable ofexerting an effect upon the mind thereby existed.Hence a dream could be considered just as “real”and thus significant as a daytime experience. Nomore eloquently has this been summarized than byShe-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed to Allan Quatermain inancient Kôr:[Allan] “I have heard of Isis of the Egyptians, Ladyof the Moon, Mother of Mysteries, spouse of Osiriswhose child was Horus the Avenger.”[Ayesha] “Aye, and I think will hear more of herbefore you have done, Allan, for now something comesback to me concerning you and her and another. I amnot the only one who has broken the oaths of Isis andreceived her curse, Allan, as you may find out in thedays to come. But what of these heavenly queens?”“Only this, Ayesha: I have been taught that theywere but phantasms fabled by men with many anotherfalse divinity, and could have sworn that this was true.And yet you talk of them as real and living, whichperplexes me.”“Being dull of understanding doubtless itperplexes you, Allan. Yet if you had imagination, youmight understand that these goddesses are greatprinciples of nature: Isis of throned Wisdom and strait- 26 -virtue, and Aphrodite of Love as it is known to menand women who, being human, have it laid upon themthat they must hand on the torch of life in their littlehour. Also you would know that such principles canseem to take shape and form and at certain ages of heworld appear to their servants visible in majesty,though perchance today others with changed nameswield their sceptres and work their will. Now you areanswered on this matter.” 9D. In Search of a Neter-TempleWhile all humans partake of the Gift of Set, inthe Temple of Set’s experience only a very few, theElect, are able first to realize, then to actualize it forany concentration and length of time. The utterabsoluteness and tension of its isolation areoverwhelming: to the Elect invigorating, to othersexhausting, even terrifying. As with Dr. Morbius inthe science-fiction classic film Forbidden Planet, thecombination of divine prerogative and animalinstinct can be devastating, indeed to self-annihilation.For this vast majority of Gifted humans, thesolution has seemed to be not extension of itsindependent divinity, but rather alignment of theirindividuality to the OU in whole or part.Some incidentally or intentionally shy away fromthe Gift of Set altogether, refusing in effect to admitto its existence or presence: materialists, atheists,agnostics.Others, aware of the Gift but fearful of itsimplications, seek the haven of conventionalreligions which denounce it as “original sin”, “the9 Haggard, Sir H. Rider, She and Allan, 1921. The Second Bookof Ayesha, Leonaur Press, page #157.- 27 -Devil”, etc. and seek to punish, destroy, and/orsublimate it.But Egyptian initiation was not exclusively, oreven principally Setian. As we shall see herein, thenatural neteru had their temples and priesthoods aswell, awakening their own disciples to atranscendental understanding of their magnificence.Later, duller cultures would fail to see orcomprehend this wondrous fabric, and wouldsubstitute superficial monotheist totems of no morethan ritualistic significance. The modern nation ofEgypt is a shameful mockery of its ancient name: atotalitarian regime in which only the three Judæo/Christian/Islamic cults are legitimized andtolerated. Egypt’s antiquities are preserved andexploited merely for the substantial tourist incomethey generate.Outside of Egypt, the term “Kemetism” refers toorganized attempts to revive worship of the neteru,but to date only the Temple of Set has substantivelyaccomplished this. 10Only in that strain of Western OU-reinclusionoccultism called “Rosicrucianism” is ancient Egyptinvoked to any degree. But before turning to this, anexotic, artistic, and uniquely American- décadent11digression is worthy of historical note.So as an indulgent, romantic, possibly obsessivepreamble to the metaphysical prospectus of thisbook - again that series of lectures presented earlierthis year to the Esoteric Order of Dagon - I inviteyou to accompany me on two “reemergences” of the10 This should not be taken to disparage other sincere effortstowards what is colloquially called “Kemeticism”.11 America is the only country which has gone from barbarismto decadence without civilisation in-between. - Oscar Wilde- 28 -glory of Egypt, in, of all heathen backwaters, theseUnited States of America.Only the Americans could build a place like this inthe middle of the jungle.

FOURTEEN YEARS OF THE STARGATEI suppose everyone who’s seen the carcass ofancient Egypt wonders what it would be like if it hadsomehow managed to survive intact, unconquered,uncontaminated all the way up to the 20th Century.In 2001 Circus-Circus Chairman WilliamBennett decided to take a shot at it.Like Las Vas’ legendary casino-resort visionary,Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel, Bennett was regarded asan eccentric, but he had the assets to indulge hiseccentricity: Unlike previous Strip resorts, Luxorwas not financed by investors; Bennet paid for itcompletely out of Circus-Circus funds. A passionateEgyptophile, he was determined that it not be acheap theme-facade, but as accurate a historictribute to ancient Egypt as modern technology couldpossibly recreate.And Bill did it.What emerged from the Nevada desert sandstwo years later was a marvel of both design andconstruction fully the equal of its inspiration faraway on the Giza Plateau in Egypt.[index-34_1.jpg][index-34_2.jpg]- 34 -B. Another “Impossible” Pyramid1.ConstructionThe Great Pyramid of Giza is famous for manyreasons - the first of which is that it was impossibleto build, and yet it was. The same could be said ofthe $375 million Luxor: another “Spruce Goose”?Bill Bennett didn’t care any more than HowardHughes did. In March of 1992 he broke ground for anew resort astonishing even by Vegas standards: agigantic, gleaming black pyramid surrounded bylush gardens and extensive oasis-lakes, as well as atowering front obelisk and a dramatic entrancebeneath the paws of a 10-story-high Great Sphinx -which at night shoots lasers from its eyes, projectingmysterious images onto a towering screen ofcascading water.The Great Pyramid of Giza is popularly, if notnecessarily accurately reputed to have taken twentyyears to build. Its Las Vegas counterpart opened itsdoors in only eighteen months, in October 1993.[index-35_1.jpg][index-35_2.jpg]- 35 -The pyramid’s central “atrium” was vastenough to hold nine 747 jumbo jetliners [if the city’sairport needed extra hanger space], and the fourwalls contained more than 2,000 rooms and 400suites, reached by “inclinators” zipping up and downthe four corners.When it opened, Luxor was Las Vegas’ second-largest hotel [next to the MGM Grand] and theeighth-largest in the world.2. Cleopatra’s BargeThe Great Pyramid sits near to the Nile River.Not to be outdone, the Luxor’s atrium was originallycircumnavigated by its own Nile, wafting guestslanguidly around the perimet in opulent, goldenbarges not seen since Elizabeth Taylor called onRichard Burton in Cleopatra. The river flowedthrough a maze of atmospheric tunnels, caves, andshrines. The barges originally paused at the fourcorners, allowing guests to access their inclinators.[index-36_1.jpg][index-36_2.jpg]- 36 -Indeed the Nile soon became so popular as tooverwhelm the atrium, hence was regretfully retired,leaving guests to make do with the four lagoon-sizedswimming pools in the palm-landscaped gardensbehind the pyramid.3. The Capstone LightRising 350 feet into the sky and crowned withthe world’s brightest beam of light, Luxor at nightguides people across the desert toward Las Vegasfrom miles away. The 40 billion candlepower xenonbeam of light is visible to pilots 250 miles away inLos Angeles.The Luxor Light is the only feature on theEarth’s surface besides the Great Wall of Chinawhich [per Space Shuttle astronauts] is visible fromorbital space with the naked eye. Bennet wasinspired by the legendary, but long stolen gleaminggold capstone of the Great Pyramid.[index-37_1.jpg][index-37_2.jpg]- 37 -4. The Angle-Lights and SoundsThere was only one problem:Everyone noticed one thing about Luxor, atnight it would disappear. Only the light beamcoming from the top can be seen. Looking fromdown the Strip, it looked like the light belonged tothe Excalibur next door. In the City of Lights this is asin. Luxor realized that something had to be done tocompete with the other resorts that glowed andglittered at night.On New Year’s Eve of December 31, 1997, aftertwo months of installing the system, the Luxorjoined the City of Lights by coordinating a $1 millionlighting project. Four years in research anddevelopment, the Starlight Lighting System iscomprised of 3,000 strobes, 4,000 circuit boardsand 2,000 computer chips. The lighting iscomprised of 5-foot-long lighting cylinders that areplugged into each other and run up all four cornersof Luxor. Each cylinder contains several strobelights as well as circuit boards to guide operation.[index-38_1.jpg][index-38_2.jpg]- 38 -Because of the Luxor's unique design, 108cylinders were used on each corner. The lightingsystem runs up the pyramid, and a sound system isinstalled just outside the structure at ground level,which are connected to integrated computersystems. The command center is located on the 30thfloor. The system is set on a timer, so that thesystem will operate automatically. The programscontain 150 special effects designs that will be usedon different occasions. Installation of the lightingsystem progressed slowly and tediously, oftenhampered by high winds and inclement weather.5. The Tomb of TutankhamunLocated at Luxor’s Attractions Level, King Tut’sTomb and Museum is the only full-scale authenticreproduction of Howard Carter’s 1922 discoveryoutside of Egypt. A self-guided walking audio tour ofthe museum allows visitors to explore theremarkable contents of the fabled tomb as thoughthey are present in the original.[index-39_1.jpg][index-39_2.jpg]- 39 -Each of the crafted works in the museum wasreproduced in Egypt using the same gold leaf andlinens, pigments, tools and 3,300 year-old artisanmethods. Once completed, the pieces were broughtto Luxor and positioned as they were originallydiscovered. Dr. Omar Mabreuck, a renownedEgyptologist who created the Pharaonic Village inEgypt, oversaw the production of the museumpieces, which took more than six months and 50people to assemble.“The museum is a tribute to the artisans of theday,” commented Dr. Mabreuck. “Modern-dayartisans designed these incredible reproductionsbecause we wanted this museum to be an homage toEgypt's treasures, not an exploitation.”Elsewhere in the pyramid were exotic storescontaining Egyptian art from rare antiquities tomodern reproductions, as well as New Agesculpture, craftwork, and music.

The Temple of Rameses IIAlthough the lobby of the Atrium showcasedthe “Ra” nightclub, the “Isis” lounge, and theentrance to the “Pharaoh’s Pheast” buffet [amidst an“archæological dig” reminiscent of Indiana Jones],Bennet found room to add a reduced-scale facade ofEgypt’s Grand Temple of Rameses II at Abu Simbel,previously borrowed by Cecil B. DeMille for the“Exodus” scene in his Ten Commandments.

A subsequenttelevision series, Stargate SG-1, continued the saga.[index-42_1.jpg][index-42_2.jpg]- 42 -A decade later one of the Goa’uld ships crashednear Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado and wastransported by the U.S. Space Command’s J2XSection to the S-4 repository at Area 51 in Nevada.The Goa’uld mistook the Luxor for the ship andsent two Anubis Guards to retrieve it. When theRings materialized them in the center of the casino,they realized the mistake.The incident ended amicably, however. BillBennett invited them to stay on as Goa’uld liaisons,to which they were only too pleased to agree afterenjoying a terrestrepast in the Pharaoh’s Pheast.The Goa’uld also solved a mystery since theoriginal 1992 excavations: tectonic-plate gapsleading to subterranean caverns of indeterminatedepth, but emitting strange lights and sounds. At thetime Bennett just built over the fissure, but theAnubis Guards obtained both instruments and anantigravity platform to safely explore the depths.One of these expeditions was filmed and madeaccessible to Luxor guests as “In Search of theObelisk”. 1414 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QveqcOj_PEM[index-43_1.jpg][index-43_2.jpg]- 43 -C. Temple of SetFollowing the restoration of his Temple in 1975CE, the neter Set has convoked periodicinternational, national, and regional Conclaves ofhis Elect. The international ones vary geographicallyworldwide.T o d a t e t h e T e m p l e h a s h e l d f o u rInternationals in Las Vegas - one at the Sahara, oneat the Imperial Palace, and then after its openingtwo at the Luxor, beginning in 2003.Amusingly we discovered that the only tworooms not Egyptian-themed at the Luxor were itslarge and small chapels. All of the Vegas resorts havechapels, usually for weddings. However suchceremonials require local Christian/Jewish clergyexclusively, and the rooms themselves arecommensurately devoid of anything “pagan”.Despite being a formally-recognized religionnationally, therefore, the Temple of Set ignoredthem; we conducted our ceremonies in the privateIsis Suite in the pyramid, which was certainly notdeEgyptianized! Bennett provided his VIP suites- 44 -with dynastic furniture, elaborately-embroideredcarpets and bedspreads - even hieroglyph-coveredshower curtains. The living room was a veritablemuseum of bas-reliefs and statues, all with theirown controllable lighting effects. The LuxorConclaves certainly needed no custom Setiandecoration! Setians were sternly admonished to notsteal the towels from their rooms; fortunately therewere plenty of robes, linens, and artifacts availableat the pyramid’s many curio shops.Indeed the Temple of Set became so enamoredof the Luxor that, in response to public questionsabout location of the Temple of Set, it was fun torespond nonchalantly, “Vegas - You can’t miss it. Wejust operate it as a hotel and casino when we’re notthere in order to pay the electric bill for the capstonelight.” Indeed for the main Ceremonial Working ofthe 2003 International, a copy of the thematic music- Deborah Martin’s Deep Roots, Hidden Water - wasp r o v i d e d t o t h e l i g h t i n g t e c h n i c i a n s f o rsimultaneous programming of the pyramid’sexterior-angles light streams. The capstone beam,however, was fixed and could not be redirectedtowards Alpha Draconis. 15The traditional receptions and banquets werehandled elegantly by the Pharaoh’s Pheast, whichuniquely among the Strip resorts had a privatedining room off the main facility.With the demise of the Luxor [see below], thisdelightful symbiosis is also relegated to history; Idoubt the Temple would have the heart to return inthe Luxor’s present state of decrepitude.15 In The Dawn of Astronomy Sir Norman Lockyer concludedthat the circumpolar constellation “The Thigh” [of Set]( Draco), and particularly the star at its head (today AlphaDraconis) localized Set for the Egyptians.[index-45_1.jpg][index-45_2.jpg]- 45 -D. The Fall of the House of LuxorAll this fun came to an end in 2007, when, ashort time after Bill Bennett’s death, Luxor [and itsneighbors Excalibur and Mandalay Bay] were sold toMGM/Mirage, which immediately commenced acrash program to destroy as much of the Luxor’sEgyptian atmosphere as possible. Only features toobig to be easily demolished, such as the GreatSphinx, survived the rape. “We’re not a Britishmuseum with ancient artifacts,” said the new LuxorManager indifferently, “we’re a casino-resort.”Within a year the destruction was underway. Thenew theme was cold modernist, airport-restroomslate blue: “to appeal to a younger, hip clientele”.In 2003, when the Temple of Set held itsInternational Conclave there, the Luxor proudly solda 10th anniversary T-shirt comparing itself to the4,500-year-old Great Pyramid of Giza: “Standingsince 1993 - 4,490 years to go.” Sadly it barelymanaged another 4.- 46 -[index-47_1.jpg]- 47 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2: EGYPT IN SAN JOSETHE STERILIZATION OF THE LUXOR LEAVES ONLY ONEEgyptian architectural presence: Rosicrucian Park inSan Jose, California.

Before examining AMORC’sinitiatory teachings in the next chapter, let’s enjoy a“snapshot” sampling of some of the Park’s majorfeatures.

O.K., Let’s RubberneckThe various buildings of the Park include:[index-49_1.jpg][index-49_2.png]- 49 -• An administration building faced with twoEgyptian pylons.Approaching Rosicrucian Park on NagleeAvenue, one is greeted by a statue of PharaohThutmose III at the corner. 16This seemingly-windowless edifice brings againto mind the Temple facade of Rameses II at AbuSimbel. It is strikingly free of decoration with theexception of the winged solar disk above theentrance-recess, and the two Horus-falcons flankingit. As its formidable frontage suggests, this is nor apublic-access building.It is a little less fortress-like from the rear,where it overlooks the Park’s Peace Garden. Withinare located the offices of AMORC’s Grand MistressJulie Scott and the Park/AMORC staff.16 T3 is one of several excellent statues about the Park havingnothing particular to do with Rosicrucianism, like AugustusCæsar.

ROOTS: FROM EL TO “THE COSMIC”To understand the rationale of Rosicrucianism,it is necessary to go back to its theological premise,Judaism, which began as a crude, fragmentarycomposite of pre-existing Canaanite17 [index_split_006.html#p55], Babylonian18[index_split_006.html#p55], and Egyptian19 [index_split_006.html#p55]polytheistic mythology, absent either17 Bronze Age (c. 3300-1200 BCE) Canaan, from which theHebrews emerged, worshipped many gods, including Ba’al,Dagon, El, & Moloch. The Hebrew Tanakh (“Old Testament”source texts) specifically identifies the later-renamed“Yahweh/YHVH/Jehovah/Cosmic” as El. In the interests ofhistorical accuracy, this book uses his original, true name (El).18 Babylonian mythology drew extensively from Sumer andAssyria, including such deities as Marduk, Enlil, and Ishtar.The Hebraic mythologies of Noah and Moses originated in theMesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh.19 Cf. Gerald Massey, A Book of the Beginnings (Seacaucus, NJ:University Books, 1974). This work was the first of his series onthe topic. Among the topics addressed: Egyptian origins ofpractically every Hebrew and Christian myth, and Egyptianorigin of the Hebrew language. Massey followed this 2-volumework with two more equally-extensive sets, Natural Genesisand Ancient Egypt, further developing and documenting thisinformation.- 56 -the crediting to or understanding of any of thesesources.A further Hebraic corruption - Dualism - wasalso appropriated, again imprecisely, from PersianZoroastrianism (after Zarathustra, ca. 600 BCE); itinvolves a conflict between two opposing forces ofthe cosmos - in Persia Ahura Mazda vs. Ahriman,and later in Hebrew lore El vs. Satan. 20The Hebraic Ten Commandments are nowdated by most “Old Testament” scholars to ca. 600BCE, some seven centuries later than the Exodus. 21Judaism’s core literature comprises the firstfive “Books of Moses” (= Torah) in the Holy Bible’s“Old Testament”. In accordance with the Torah,20 While in original Persian Dualism the powers and influenceof Ahura Mazda and Ahriman constituted a divine balance, theHebrews and their Christian/Islamic variations, have neverbeen able to resolve the dilemma of a supposedly omnipotentand good El with the existence of evil; the dilemma of theodicy.21 Cf. Romer, John, Testament. New York: Henry Holt, 1988,page #58: “Hard evidence of the Exodus event in thepreserving deserts of the Sinai, where most of the biblicalWandering takes place, is similarly elusive. Although itsclimate has preserved the tiniest traces of ancient bedouinencampments and the sparse, 5,000-year-old villages of mine-workers, there is not a single trace of Moses or the Israelites.And they would have been by far the largest body of ancientpeople ever to have lived in this great wilderness. Neither isthere any evidence that Sinai and its little natural springs couldever have supported such a multitude, even for a single week.Several 19th-century vicars recognized this fact within a day ortwo of the start of numerous expeditions in search of Moses’footsteps. “Escaping from the rigours of an English winter,” asone of them says, “in a land of the flock and the tent to whichour only guide was the Bible” they quickly realized that thebiblical Exodus was logistically impossible and that the Biblewas a most ambiguous guide to that desolate region. Thebiblical description of the Exodus, then, flies in the face ofpractical experience. Indeed the closer you examine it, thefurther it seems removed from all of ancient history.”- 57 -mankind’s Edenic “original sin” is inescapable: Mancan only suffer El’s wrath and Commandments untilEl decides to send a “redeeming” Messiah.Christians and Muslims believe that thisMessiah did arrive in the person of Jesus Christ andMohammed respectively, but Judaism rejects both -the basis for the hopefully-redeemeds’ hatred of theparent cult for snatching away their promise ofposthumous Paradise instead of the hideous, eternalnightmare of the Jewish Sheol 22.In the 13th Century CE, however, Jews [anduncertain Christians] were offered a new hope fornon-Messianic redemption. The Spanish Jew Mosesde León authored a series of books, the Zohar(“Splendor”), claiming to reveal divine mysteriesconcealed in the Torah. 23 The mysticism containedin the Zohar is known as [Hebrew] Cabala (aka“Kabbalah”, “Qabala”, etc.). The word means“aligned” or “corresponding”, and purported tochart an initiatory pathway to redemption bypersonal effort alone.In medieval and Renaissance Europe Cabalismwas limited to secret societies such as Freemasonry,Illuminism, and Rosicrucianism, since “self-redemption” is mortal heresy in orthodox religions.22 Hebrew לוֹאְׁש‎, in the Torah, is a place of darkness to whichall the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous,regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillnessand darkness cut off from life and from El.23 Moses de León ascribing the Zohar to the 2nd-century rabbiShimon bar Yochai, who hid in a cave for thirteen yearsstudying the Torah and was inspired by the prophet Elijah towrite the Zohar. León’s widow confessed that her husband hadwritten it, using the prophet for profit. ( Jewish Encyclopedia,Funk & Wagnalls)- 58 -B. Origins of RosicrucianismRosicrucianism as a tradition has as manylineages, histories, organizations, and authorities ascan be imagined, and probably a few more thatcan’t. Some say it started with the XVIII DynastyPharaoh Akhenaten (ca. 1352-1335 BCE); otherswith Christian Rosenkreuz, fabled author of three17th Century CE German tracts: Fama Fraternitatis(1614), Confessio Fraternitatis (1615), and TheChymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (sic)(1616). 24There are no records from Akhenaten25 or anyother Egyptian pharaoh of starting or sponsoring asecret society like Rosicrucianism. Egypt’s initiatory24 German Lutheran theologian Johannes Andreæ revealed inhis autobiography that he had written “Chymical Wedding” in1605 as an imaginative satire; given the location, language, &timing of all three documents’ publication, he may haveauthored the other two as well. The rose & cross was a well-known Lutheran symbol, and none of the documents’ contentsare supported by any external personalities, organizations, orevents, such as pro bono wandering physicians in 17th-centuryEurope. That said, I cannot recall any avowed Rosicrucian, orR-organization, fulfilling this central exhortation of the FamaFraternitatis either. When this book gets around to itsproposed “purifications” of AMORC, this is why one of themwill be a standing contribution to “Doctors Without Borders”.25 Akhenaten is popularly revered for his supposed Judaism-anticipatory monotheism, with Hollywood portraying him as aChristlike figure in movies such as The Egyptian (1954).Sigmund Freud even argued that Moses was actually an Atenistpriest, fleeing the other gods’ wrath following Akhenaten’sdeath.The historical Akhenaten (aka Amenhotep IV), whileinitially tolerant of all neteru, gradually suppressed, thenprohibited their reverence, while declaring himself the soleintermediary of Aten (an aspect of Ra). El has no Aten-traits[other than jealousy], and the earliest traces of Judaism per sedate ca. 500 years after Akhenaten’s death.- 59 -wisdom was preserved, guarded, and passed downthrough the several priesthoods of the neteru. 26There is no evidence that such a person as CRactually existed, or formed/participated in aninitiatory society, “Rosicrucian” or otherwise. Thefirst pamphlet proposes an organization of rovingphysicians, curing the sick gratis, but there is norecord of such a contemporary medical charity. Thesecond and third are little more than J-C mysticalreveries of no practical consequence.None of the three pamphlets mentions theEgyptian neteru or describes ancient Egyptianteachings, initiatory or otherwise. At the turn of the17th Century, Egypt was still a largely-forgottenjunkpile until Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign acentury later, and Champollion’s 1822 translation ofthe Rosetta Stone, awakened European interest.The symbol of a rose & cross was well-known inGermany from the 16th Century as the emblem ofLutheran Christianity. 27Surveying the various occult movements inwestern & northern Europe during the last fewcenturies, one sees a Freemasonic pattern, a pre-Christian pagan pattern, and a Judæo-ChristianCabalistic pattern - the third of these being mostly inSpain, France, Belgium, and Britain. Thus by the19th Century we find the Societas Rosicruciana in26 Sources, selections, and applications of such knowledge maybe found in the libraries and archives of the Temple of Set. Forintroductory bibliography concerning Egyptian philosophy andmetaphysics, as well as initiation theory and experience, cf. therelevant Categories of the Temple’s publicly-available ReadingList.

Aquino, The Temple of Set, Volume II)http://www.amazon.com/dp/149756757227 An analysis of Rosicrucian symbolism generally, as well asthe AMORC emblem specifically, is contained in Appendix #2.- 60 -Anglia (S.R.I.A.) and its famous successor theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.'.D.'.), andin the early 20th Century Aleister Crowley’s AstrumArgentum (A.'.A.'.). Along the way Rosicrucianismregressed from the Catholic mysticism of the threeoriginal CR documents to Zohar Cabalism,ostensibly just for its obscure-secrets glamour,including an initiatory grade system aligned toLeón’s “Tree of Life” schematic.While the research-work of the Golden Dawn’smost famous architect, Samuel L. MacGregorMathers, was strictly Zohar-Cabalistic28, the G.'.D.'.London & Paris ceremonies enjoyed a dash ofAbydos-Triad (Osiris/Isis/Horus) Egyptianacourtesy of Florence Farr. 29Aleister Crowley invoked the same triad for hisA.'.A.'., although his famous Book of the Law was28 As for instance his exhaustive translation of The SacredMagic of Abra=Melin the Mage at the Louvre in Paris. Thisand his other research may be reviewed in Sword of Wisdom:MacGregor Mathers and “The Golden Dawn” by IthellColquhoun. NY: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1975.29 Cf. Egyptian Magic by Florence Farr (Wellingborough,Northamptonshire: Aquarian Press, 1982). The actressFlorence Farr was one of the more famous initiates of theG.'.D.'. and was a particularly close friend of W.B. Yeats andG.B. Shaw. A very readable summary of the Egyptian magicaltradition, also notable for its section on Gnostic Christianity asdeveloped in post-dynastic Egypt.Herein may be found the G.'.D.'. roots of the “Æonic”system into which Aleister Crowley would propose the Æon ofHorus.For Yeats’ involvement and emphases, cf. Yeats’ GoldenDawn by George Mills Harper (NY: Barnes & Noble, 1974): thebest account of Yeats’ encounter with occultism - first viaBlavatsky’s Theosophical Society and then with the G.'.D.'.after 1891.- 61 -inspired by a stele of the pre-Abydos Ra-Harakhte(HarWer, the Great Horus). 30C. AMORC ArrivesIn 1915 American occultist Harvey SpencerLewis decided to start a “Rosicrucian” organizationof his own. Interestingly he avoided the Egyptianritual of the British groups, as well as the ZoharCabalism of the French, inclining instead towards adeistic31, natural-science atmosphere generallycharacterizing AMORC to this day.AMORC’s “authorizing charter”, calligraphedby Lewis, is titled “American PronunziamentoNumber One”, the original copy of which, as signedby Secretary General Thor Kiimalehto, establishesthe AMORC “in accordance with an officialmanifesto O.T.O.”Lewis subsequently personally deposited theoriginal, countersigned, and “O.T.O.”-annotatedcopy of this document with the New York City PublicLibrary, where it was accidentally discovered years30 Cf. Overthrowing the Old Gods: Aleister Crowley and theBook of the Law by Don Webb (Rochester, VT: InnerTraditions, 2013).An extensive historical and philosophicalexamination, including both his detailed commentary of thetext and several separate essays concerning the principlescontained therein.31 Deism is belief in the existence of a supreme being,specifically of a creator who does not intervene in the universe.It became fashionable consequent to the scientific rationalismof the Enlightenment, as a way to acknowledge El withouthaving to actually bother with him or his institutions or clergy.Deism was prevalent among the United States’ FoundingFathers, accounting for the tone of the Declaration ofIndependence & Constitution. It has since remained the defacto religion of America, with the various religiousinstitutions relegated to social and decorative utility.[index-62_1.jpg][index-62_2.jpg]- 62 -later by Rosicrucian historian Robert Vanloo32. Thisdiscovery sent shock waves through San Jose, whereAMORC possesses only an un-countersigned copy ofthe original. What makes this inconvenient are thoselittle “O.T.O.” initials on the original only,attributing MORC’s charter to the Ordo TempliOrientis. Consequently San Jose has attempteddesperately [but unsuccessfully] to discredit theNYPL original, and failing that to determinedlyignore it and hope everyone else will as well.To understand why this license should be soexcruciating, we’ll need to talk a bit about the O.T.O.But first a closer look at the Pronunziamento itself:Pronunziamento #1: New York (left) and San Jose (right)32 Vanloo, Robert, Les Rose-Croix du Nouveau Monde. Paris:Claire Vigne Editrice, 1996. Vanloo’s detailed account of hisresearch is currently available online at:http://parareligion.ch/sunrise/vanloo/ameng.htm- 63 -It appears that the new AMORC SecretaryGeneral was not the only one to sign this birthcertificate. Above his signature is Lewis’ effort at apharaonic cartouche.Lewis presumably intended this to be thesignature of Thutmose IV, whom he claimed to bethe founder of Rosicrucianism after he had restoredThoth as a god following Akhenaten’s suppression ofall but the Aten.This, however, would have involved time-travel, as T4 was Akhenaten’s grandfather.T4 is famous for clearing away the sand thatnear-buried the Great Sphinx, in gratitude for whichsaid Sphinx anointed him the next pharaoh.There is no record of T4’s establishing theRosicrucians, nor would he have created aninitiatory society re-ignoring the neteru in favor ofan alien Hebrew monotheism, doubtless re-annoying the Sphinx as well.And requiring some additional time-travelconvolutions. T4 reigned ca. 1415-1405 BCE. Evenafter materializing post his grandson Akhenaten (ca.1370-1352) in order to restore the affronted neteru,T4 would have had to take an even deeper breathand zoom forward into the next dynasty (XIX) inorder to El-monotheize the actual, hieroglyphic-documented “Exodus” [of non-Hebrew Goshenslaves] during the reign of Merenptah (ca.1232-1224) [not M’s deMilled dad Rameses II].Of course if T4 could bounce around like this,an extra commute to 1915 CE wouldn’t have posed aproblem.With all this Rosicrucian effort by T4, onewonders why the appreciative statue at RosicrucianPark is of his granddad T3![index-64_1.png]- 64 -Lewis’ forged “cartouche” also fails to includethe surrounding oval’s crossbar, and replaces theEgyptian hieroglyphic men-symbol with ameaningless sketch of a medieval castle rampart.The corrected cartouche was a “throne name” ofmany pharaohs, and would have been preceded bythe appropriate honorifics, and translated to“Everlasting Manifestation of Ra”:O.K., now let’s get back to the O.T.O. ...D. “Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis”The O.T.O. ( Ordo Templi Orientis33 ) had beenfounded ca. 1896 by the German Karl Kellner, whoclaimed it to embody the “ultimate secret ofinitiation”: a combination of Bengali Tantric andSufi “sex magic”. 34While there is no similarity between theinitiatory systems of AMORC and O.T.O. today, SanJose seems rather at pains to cleanse its origins fromany O.T.O. taint. This is perhaps the consequence of33 “Order of the Eastern Temple”. Both the name and theinitials have a secret significance: The “supreme secret” of theOrder was “sex magic”, in which the “Western Temple”identifies the vagina and the “Eastern Temple” the [morepotent] anus. Similarly the three letters represent the penisbetween two testicles. The “normal” initiatory degrees of theOrder conclude with the VII°. Beyond this is the “SovereignSanctuary of the Gnosis”: the VIII° (masturbation), the IX°(heterosexual vaginal sex), and the XI° (the “IX° reversed”:homosexual anal sex). [The X° is merely administrative,identifying a “national king” within each nation hosting theOrder.]34 King, Francis, The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O. London: C.W.Daniel, 1973, page #22. For a detailed discussion of theseEastern precedents see King, Sexuality, Magic & Perversion.London: Spearman, 1972.- 65 -the O.T.O.’s penchant for ceremonial sex-magic,which is a touch too risqué for AMORC’s staidsensibilities, not to mention O.T.O.’s connectionwith the infamous Aleister Crowley: Do What ThouWilt libertine, drug-fiend diarist, and sex-magicianpar decadence.These Nameless Rites & Unspeakable Orgies ofO.T.O. were presumably not so apparent to HarveyLewis during AMORC’s fledgling years, when heevidently craved external, European [in addition topharaonic] validation for his new Order. By 1921Lewis had accepted the O.T.O. VII° and the“Masonic” 33°90°95° from Outer Head of the OrderTheodor Reuss. 35Twelve years later Lewis would additionallydecorate his name with a nonexistent academic“Ph.D.”. 36E. Religion or Not?As we have seen, AMORC is conceptually,ideologically, mythologically, and organizationally areligion: a deistic interpretation of El-monotheisticJudaism with the addition of Hindu reincarnation.This entire complex is nowhere claimed orargued to be the product of a scientific, algorithmicprocess, bur is completely faith-based; behind35 The VII° is the highest non-sex-magic degree of the O.T.O.In 1921 Reuss was International Grand Master of Memphis-Misraïm, a “clandestine” (unrecognized) Masonic rite. Lewiswas never a legitimate Mason.36 In 1933 Lewis was named a “Doctor in Psychological andHermetic Sciences of the Université de la Rose+Croix” byBelgian occultist Émile Dantinne, which Lewis thereafterrelabeled “Ph.D.” for his book title-pages and other formaldocuments.- 66 -the Monographs’ presentations of materialist,natural science and personal/physical health, any &all metaphysical concepts are couched in lofty butmeaningless jargon, attributed where necessary to“the Cosmic”, e.g. El.So of course AMORC is a religion.Nevertheless it adamantly insists that it’snothing of the sort. From the “Frequently-AskedQuestions” on its website:No. AMORC, which stands for Ancient andMystical Order Rosæ Crucis, is not a religion anddoes not require a specific code of belief orconduct. Rosicrucian students come from a varietyof cultural and religious backgrounds. Becoming aRosicrucian student does not in any way requireyou to leave your church, join a church, or changeyour religious beliefs. Some Rosicrucian membersdo not subscribe to any specific religious beliefs atall. For students who do, we encourage them toparticipate in the religion of their choice. As aresult, Rosicrucian students come from everyreligious denomination, and through ourteachings, many find a greater appreciation of themystical principles underlying their individualreligious and philosophical beliefs. Those who donot belong to any particular religion often discovera sense of connection with a higher intelligencethat was missing in their lives before.The ostensible purpose of this statement is todeflect criticism or condemnation from establishedJudæo-Christian institutions, who are habituallyand historically inclined to denounce as “sataniccults” competitors for the masses’ credulity, loyaltyand wallets; well-known examples in America beingthe 19th-century Mormons and the 20th-centuryScientologists.Even so, AMORC is routinely denounced as a“mind-control cult” if not as a satanic one. Of course- 67 -in the competitive arena of institutional religions,“mind control” is simply the other factions’ “faith”.AMORC is arguably no different.Yet AMORC is not a “shepherd/sheep” religionof El-deputized clergy issuing orders and profferingcounsel in his name.It is characteristic of the slave-religions that themasses need only obey [and, in Christianity, acceptJesus’ Grace]. They need not understand any of it,indeed are admonished not to attempt tounderstand El who is axiomatically beyond humancomprehension. 37This, however, is where initiation differs frommere passive inculcation. Initiation offers theindividual a [Right-Hand] path to redemption:reacceptance by and reabsorption into the universal,divine consciousness of El. All RHP courses ofinitiation have this as their goal: the obliteration ofthe “original sin” separate self.Is this a desirable, indeed the only,inevitable, desirable goal, through RHP initiationas much as Grace? As AMORC summarizes it toinitiates upon their admission to its Temple-degrees:The result of Rosicrucian mysticism is themastery of the ego and the blossoming of the soulconsciousness. It is a purification process thatmakes each level of being suitable as a channel forDivine Intelligence. It is a total conscioussurrender to the Supreme Truth that awaits themoment to manifest itself.37 Theology is a system for explaining things by coining wordswhich nobody can understand and pretending that the wordsmen something. Among Western primates the chief word usedfor this purpose is “God”; among Eastern primates it is“karma”. - Robert Anton Wilson, Schrödinger’s Cat I ( (1979).- 68 -We then realize how much the intellect canbecome an obstacle if it holds sway, although wecan also see that it may become an instrument thatallows the expression of what transcends it.Accordingly the intellect should not be neglected;it must be trained, educated, and mastered so as tobecome the primary vehicle, the fundamentalinstrument, the faithful transmitter from belowupwards and from above downwards. 38F. Traditional Rosicrucian Initiation1.Postincarnate DestinationAMORC’s RHP initiation curriculum differssubstantially from those of historic RosicrucianOrders. First we’ll summarize them, then examinethe AMORC differences.To make sense of the RHP initiatory conceptand process, it’s necessary to relate it to the humanexperience of life/death.All conventional religions save one have astheir core purpose and justification the alleviation ofhumans’ ignorance and fear of bodily death, which isassumed to take one’s conscious existence, or “soul”along with it.The one exception to such penance is orthodox( Torah) Judaism.While there have been many explanations forother religions’ antipathy towards Judaism, one ofthe most telling has todo with Jews’ failure to beposthumously accountable in any way for theirincarnate conduct, implying that they are self-serving and indifferent to ethics. As discussed above,they see themselves - indeed all humankind -doomed to the horror of posthumous Sheol,38 Temple I° Monograph, “Consecration of the Sanctuary”,page #4.- 69 -regardless of any prehumous efforts they mightmake, such as obedience to or solicitation of El, toavert this fate.Observed Dietrich Eckart, initiate of the ThuleGesellschaft and mentor to Adolf Hitler and AlfredRosenberg:It is now evident that a people whichcompletely denies the existence of life after deathmust limit all of its thoughts and endeavors to thepresent world, to earthly existence; it has no otherchoice. But a people can only grow up with such anemphasis on worldly matters if it fundamentallylacks any need for immortality, which in turn ispossible only if there is no trace of feeling in itsbasic character for the eternal in mankind.Wherever the soul manifests itself, nomatter how faintly, a sense of immortalitynecessarily follows.The individual is not always consciouslyaware of this; indeed there are many who refuse tounderstand it - who are so ignorant concerning theconcept of immortality that they habituallydenounce it, even while their unselfish actionsclearly reveal that each one of them senses the souland therefore eternity within himself. 39Although Pauline Christianity attempted toappropriate the Pythagorean/Platonic concept of the“soul distinct within and ultimately freed from thebody”, it was unable to sustain this concept withoutthe vehicle of the body.Christian artistic representations of posthumousParadise are invariably sterile and dull. It will berecalled that Christ’s ultimate promise upon hisSecond Coming was to reunite all souls with theirex-bodies, so that they would once again enjoy theiroriginal corporeal shells. This is of course39 Eckhart, Dietrich, Auf gut deutsch (1919).- 70 -impossible if Earthly reincarnation has been takingplace in the meantime.The conventional religious “rescue” from theJewish forecast of Sheol is simple: If you areobedient to the religion during life, your soul will bewhisked away to an eternal “Heaven” or “Paradise”.If you’ve been disobedient, to a comparably-unpleasant “Hell”.One would assume that, with these alternativedestinations being as important as they are, thesesame religions would have described them prettythoroughly, if only in myth and revelation. Curiouslythis has not been the case. With the exception of afew well-known efforts, like the Holy Bible’s “Bookof Revelation”, Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy,and John Milton’s Paradise Lost, both destinationsremain vague.If pressed, the average American mightimagine Heaven to be something like Disneyland, orperhaps the Las Vegas Strip with overflowingjackpots and front-row show seats. Hell, on theother hand, might be an endless income-tax auditwhile immobilized in a permanent Los Angelesfreeway traffic jam.2. TimeConventional/RHP religions incorporate one oftwo concepts of time: linear or cyclical. 40What all Western religions have in common isthe linear time of Judaism. Jewish mythologyposits a “Genesis” of creation, followed by a time-40 In Left-Hand Path/Setian initiation there are two differenttime-concepts: circular [per Egyptian metaphysics] andtimeless. For discussions of these see my books MindStar andFindFar.- 71 -unidirectional, everything-&-everyone-inclusiveforced-march to a final “Apocalypse”. 41This linear-time scenario is microcosmed ineach human’s lifespan: It has a beginning, anincarnate-life ordeal of trial and obedience, and anend/consequence. You’ve got just one shot atexistence, so you’d better make it come out inAnaheim.The principal Eastern religions - Hinduism andBuddhism - are cyclical, not linear. The line of timekeeps moving onward in a “Great Mandala” 42, towhich souls keep returning in endless up/downreincarnations, until/unless they’re nirvan ically-perfect enough to escape it into Eternal Bliss( Ānanda).In an initiatory RHP religion, everythingdepends upon whether your curriculum ofperfection & reinclusion in El is intended to beaccomplished in the course of one lifetime. If it is,the Jewish linear-time model suffices. This is themodel of Torah Cabalism.B u t i f y o u r c u r r i c u l u m p r o v i d e s f o rincompletion, or inadequate purification, thenyou’re up against a dilemma: If there’s an inevitableHeaven/Hell, and instead of a life of passiveobedience and/or the acceptance of Grace, you’ve“brazenly” presumed self-purification/perfectionthrough initiation, any inadequacy or incompletionwill doom you to the L.A. freeway.41 Even in a cultural climate of materialist deism, this linear-time model is reflected in the “one-way” Big Bang image ofcosmology. Theoretically it would be just as possible toenvision a cyclical universe of endless expansion/contractionoscillation.42 with an appreciative, sentimental nod to Peter, Paul, andMary.- 72 -So with RHP initiation it is far safer to have acyclical-reincarnation doctrine, permitting as manyrepetitions of initiation as necessary to achieve El-absorption.And indeed that is what AMORC has done: ahybrid of Western Jewish linear incarnate lifespancoupled together with Hindu karma-based Earthlyreincarnation.Is there a divine (“Cosmic”/El) prescription forthis hybrid? Not at all; indeed the notion of cyclicaltime in any manifestation is a denial, one mightsay a “blasphemy” of a creator/unidirectional El.Unidirectionalism is essential to this kind ofgod: As Georg Hegel explained it in his cosmology ofDialectic Idealism, the entire course of universalhistory constitutes the mind of El in the process offully understanding itself. The “recycling” of anycomponent would compromise this Dialectic as awhole.3. The Tree of LifeSetting aside for awhile AMORC’s linear/cyclical time-contradiction, let’s look next at thestructure of traditional Rosicrucianism’s initiation-path: the Cabalistic “Tree of Life”.According to the Zohar, the universe and all ofits contents derive from a manifestation of Eltermed Ain Soph Aour, the Infinite or LimitlessLight. Issuing from this source are ten rays orSephiroth, being progressively coarser or morematerial manifestations of El.As the Cabalist initiate ascends from one levelof initiatory existence to another, then, hesupposedly is that much closer to the purelyspiritual existence of El.- 73 -In 19th Century France Alphonse LouisConstant, better known by his Hebraicized name of“Éliphas Lévi” 43, was the best-known proponent ofJewish Cabalism and Catholic-Christian ceremonialmagic, inspiring the French mystic JoséphinPéladan and his Belgian disciple Émile Dantinne,both of whom affected “Rosicrucianism” for itsvague, mysterious glamour.Continental and British Rosicrucians alikefollowed Lévi’s prescription, locking their initiatorydegrees or grades to the path up through the “Treeof Life” from Earth to El. Principal degree-nameswere duly associated with specific Sephiroth [tboughno one could or did explain why].For a bit of extra drama and brinksmanship, an“Abyss” was later added to the “Tree” below the top-three Sephiroth: This Abyss would remain anuncrossable barrier to divine spirituality for even themost dedicated incarnate initiates, until AleisterCrowley jumped it, avoiding the jaws of Choronzonin the Tenth Æthyr, to become a still-incarnateMagister Templi (8)=[3]. 44The “Tree of Life” is represented thus:43 Cf. Éliphas Lévi: Master of Occultism by Thomas A.Williams (University of Alabama Press, 1975). Amidst all theconfusion surrounding Levi, this little 174-page biographystands as an island of scholarship. Williams discusses the factsof his life, philosophy, and writings succinctly, suggesting priorinfluences and subsequent legacies. Today most of Lévi’sdoctrines are thoroughly outdated, but in many ways he wasthe Columbus of modern occult science. Extensively footnoted,with a good bibliography and a list of Levi’s own works.44 Cf. Crowley, Aleister, The Vision and The Voice (Dallas:Sangreal Foundation, 1972). This book contains the record ofCrowley’s experiences with the thirty Æthyrs of the XIXEnochian Key of John Dee.. The visions are considered bymany to be Crowley’s most beautiful magical record.[index-74_1.jpg][index-74_2.png]- 74 -- 75 -4. Golden DawnThe grades (as they were then called) of theG.'.D.'. were:GradeSephirah AttributionNeophyte (0)=[0][None]Zelator (1)=[10]MalkuthTheoricus (2)=[9]YesodPracticus (3)=[8]HodPhilosophus (4)=[7]NetzachAdeptus Minor (5)=[6]TipharethAdeptus Major (6)=[5]GeburahAdeptus Exemptus (7)=[4] ChesedMagister Templi (8)=[3] BinahMagus (9)=[2]ChokmahIpsissimus (10)=[1]KetherThe G.'.D.'. grades of Zelator throughPhilosophus were concerned with an understandingand mastery of the “elemental” forces governing thephysical plane.The three Adeptus grades - which collectivelycomprised the Second Order of the G.'.D.'. (theOrder of the Red Rose and Golden Cross) - raisedthe initiate to spiritual levels of apprehension.The grades of Magister Templi throughIpsissimus were considered Astral grades beyondincarnated human manifestation; hence none of thethree G.'.D.'. leaders (Westcott, Mathers, Woodman)professed a claim to them. As Dr. F.I. Regardieobserved in The Golden Dawn:It is impossible for the ordinary individual tounderstand those above the grade of AdeptusMinor, and individuals who lay claim to suchexalted grades, by that very act place a gigantic- 76 -question mark against the validity of theirattainment. He that exalted is humble. And to havetasted that which is conveyed by the AdeptusMinor grade is so lofty an experience that few intheir right minds, unless they were extremelysaintlike in character, would consider themselvesas having passed officially to a higher spiritualstate.5. Astrum ArgentumBefore proceeding to the AMORC version, let’stake a look at the next modification, that designedby Aleister Crowley for his G.'.D.'.-successororganization, the Astrum Argentum (A.'.A.'. = SilverStar).He described the A.'.A.'. system in an appendixto Magick entitled “One Star in Sight”. It was achange from the G.'.D.'. concept only insofar as itwas redesigned to coincide with the concepts ofinitiation set forth in the Book of the Law. Certaingrade names were added or altered, and there was ageneral lessening of “pure” Cabalistic emphasis:The Order of the Star called S.S. is, inrespect of its existence upon the Earth, anorganized body of men and womendistinguished among their fellows by thequalities here enumerated. They exist intheir own Truth, which is both universaland unique. They move in accordancewith their own Wills, which are eachunique yet coherent with the universalwill.They perceive (that is, understand,know, and feel) in love, which is bothunique and universal.- 77 -The order consists of eleven grades ordegrees and is numbered as follows. Thesecompose 3 groups: the Orders of the S.S.,of the R.C., and of the G.D. respectively.Order of the Golden DawnProbationer (0)=[0]Neophyte (1)=[10]Zelator (2)=[9]Practicus (3)=[8]Philosophus (4)=[7]“Dominus Liminus - the link”Order of the Rosy CrossAdeptus Minor (5)=[6]Adeptus Major (6)=[5]Adeptus Exemptus (7)=[4]“Babe of the Abyss - the link”Order of the Silver StarMagister Templi (8)=[3]Magus (9)=[2]Ipsissimus (10)=[1](These figures have specialmeanings to the initiated and arecommonly employed to designate thegrades.)The general characteristics andattributions of these Grades areindicated by their correspondences onthe Tree of Life, as may be studied indetail in the Book 777.- 78 -Student: His business is to acquirea general intellectual knowledgeof all systems of attainment, asdeclared in the prescribed books(Appendix 1 of Magick).Probationer:It is his principalbusiness to begin such practicesas he may prefer, and to write acareful record of the same for oneyear.Neophyte: Has to acquire perfectcontrol of the Astral Plane.Zelator: His main work is to achievecomplete success in Asana andPranayama. He also begins tostudy the formula of the RosyCross.Practicus: Is expected to completehis intellectual training, and inparticular to study the Qabalah.Philosophus: He is expected tocomplete his moral training. Heis tested in devotion to the Order.Dominus Liminis: Is expected toshow mastery of Pratyahara andDharana.Adeptus (without): Is expected toperform the Great Work, thus theKnowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel.Adeptus (within): Is admitted to thepractice of the formula of theRosy Cross upon entering theCollege of the Holy Ghost.- 79 -Adeptus (Major): Obtains a generalmastery of practical Magick,though without comprehension.Adeptus (Exemptus): Completes inperfection all these matters. Hethen either (a) becomes a Brotherof the Left Hand Path or (b) isstripped of all his attainmentsand of himself as well, even of hisHoly Guardian Angel, and thenbecomes a Babe of the Abyss,who, having transcended theReason, does nothing but grow inthe womb of its mother. It thenfinds itself a -Magister Templi (Master of theTemple): whose functions arefully described in Liber 418, as isthis complete initiation fromAdeptus Exemptus. See also“Aha!” His principal business it totend his “garden” of disciples andto obtain a perfect understandingof the Universe. He is a Master ofSamadhi.Magus: Attains to wisdom, declareshis law [see Liber I vel Magi],and is a Master of all Magick inits greatest and highest sense.Ipsissimus: Is beyond all this andbeyond all comprehension ofthose of lower degrees.- 80 -G. AMORC Initiation1.DegreesWhile AMORC uses [mostly] the “Tree of Life”names for its degrees, it becomes immediatelyobvious that the progression is not based uponZohar Cabalism. Indeed there is no “ascension fromthe material to the spiritual” in it at all. Rather, likeits pre-Temple “preview”, it consists of high-school-level natural science, complemented with guidelinesfor personal bodily health and a purposeful,creative, and constructive lifestyle.

This isadmonished to be towards “thegreatest good and highestprinciples you know” - which, ifyou are not yet “one with El”, setsyour personal judgment againsthis, e.g. the existing momentumof Natural Law.The IX° thereby formallyconfronts the dilemma of RHPinitiation, which is the distinctionof the ultimately-strengthenedindividual consciousness fromthat of El: necessitating eitherwillful defiance of “CosmicConsciousness” (El) or completesurrender to him by refusingpersonal continuation of will:absorption into “CC” 46Without either addressing orresolving this dilemma, the IX°Monographs veer off into a menuof stock-occult NL-violations,such as telepathy, telekinesis,46 “Cosmic Consciousness” constitutes the entire realm of thepenultimate “Illuminati Section” [no connection with theBavarian I.], as well as the ultimate XII°+ “Ordo SummumBonum” [with no fewer than 144 Astral Planes to explore. Thenew Illuminatus is relieved to discover that Black Magic lurksonly on the first two of these, leaving the remaining 142 safefor blissful basking]. (Illuminati Section Monograph)- 84 -vibroturgy 47, radiesthesia48, andinvisibility 49.We conclude the AMORC degree-summaries atthis point, because the subsequent “Illuminati”degrees descend [or ascend, as the case may be] intothe incoherently-jargonistic. The distinctions are:Illuminati SectionIlluminatus Minor X° (originally“Magus”, then “Ipsissimus’).Illuminatus Major XI°.Illuminatus Ipsissimus XII°(orig. “Illuminatus Exemptus”).47 “Vibroturgy” is defined as “the mental reading of ‘vibrations’in an object imparted to it by previous owners or handlers”.While no such phenomenon occurs in nature, such “reading” isan illusion long-popular with stage magicians [and fraudsusing stage-magic trickery to devceive the gullible].48 “Radiesthesia” is defined as “sensitiveness held to enable aperson with the aid of divining rod or pendulum to detectthings (such as the presence of underground water, the natureof an illness, or the guilt of a suspected person); also :dowsing,divining”. While there is some basis for human sub-sensorysensitivity to non-visual water sources, extrapolation of suchperception to “mind-reading” is absurd. Once again, theillusion of “mentalism” is a stage-magic specialty, and againalso subject to fraudulent misuse by con-artists.49 In the context of this list of deceptive fraud, it is difficult tosee RHP initiatory justification for a claimed power ofinvisibility, nor do AMORC Monographs teach such a power.[In less-fanciful contexts, such as espionage and martial arts,techniques to avoid being noticed are indeed taught; and yetagain invisibility is a stage-magic illusion. Interestingly in thelaboratory, physicists are experimenting with the deflectionand “jamming” of light-waves to wholly or partially conceal testobjects.- 85 -2. Evaluationa. Posthumous PromiseThe purpose of the Cabalistic “Tree of Life” isto chart a personal initiatory path for the separated“soul”, initially detecting and defining itself againstonly the contents and background of the OU, toprogressively learn about, become aware of, andexercise its non-material/spiritual aspects, thusdrawing ever closer to the wholly-spiritual existenceof El, until it finally is refined, purified enough to beseamlessly merged into that primal consciousness,losing the last vestiges of separateness in thatculmination.The initiatory degrees of previous Rosicrucianorganizations are aligned to the “Tree of Life”accordingly, but that of AMORC is not. There is nomention of the Tree, Cabala, or the Zohar.What is retained is the Jewish monotheism,absent Redeemer Christianity or Islam variants, butstill premised on the “original sin” of mankind in itsordinary, non-initiated separateness. The initiationthat AMORC offers is advertised to return thedisciple to “Cosmic (=El) Consciousness”.If a Rosicrucian fails to achieve this in a singleincarnate lifespan, AMORC further promises[Hindu] Earthly reincarnation, as repeatedly asnecessary until the goal of “CC” reunion/obliterationis finally attained.Throughout the entire corpus of AMORCMonographs, no basis, authority, or source for thisposthumous promise - the ultimate, essential, andfinal goal of Rosicrucian initiation - is ever cited.The curious student is referred to “Rosicruciantradition”, or vague intimations from “the Cosmic”.- 86 -b. Cold WaterAs the reader realizes by now, AMORC’spromise of melding into “CC” through its initiatorycurriculum is complete and utter nonsense:• The underlying Judaic religion isnothing more than a crude,incoherent composite of previousreligions and superstitions. It isthus a hollow shell of nothingness,including its caricature of theborrowed Canaanite god El.• As Judaism is a fiction, itsderivatives Christianity and Islamare consequently also fiction. Thatall three of these religions havedeceived and enslaved countlesshumans for millennia proves onlythat.• As Torah Judaism is baseless, anyattempt to master it, e.g. by theinvented and disattributed Zoharand its Cabala are also vacuous anduseless.• As Judaism is a lie, its dreadedSheol is also nonexistent. Nor isincarnate humanity in the least“sinful” or “shameful” by merelyexisting as individual, consciousbeings.- 87 -• The Hindu concept of Earthlyreincarnation would be a mortalheresy to all of the El-religions if itindeed actually existed, since thosereligions all insist on linear timeand singularity of the “soul” and its[only] physical body - so much sothat they proclaim their eventualreunification at the “end of time”.• Its Western heresy aside, Hindureincarnation is disproved by theabsence of cumulative memory(which is what ultimate establishespersonal, isolate identity), and bythe extreme imbalance of world-wide births/deaths, and by thecontinuing compounding of worldpopulation.• Even if Hindu reincarnation didexist despite its gross populationinconsistencies, it would still benothing but a cruel joke on thesupposedly “continuing” soul:I care not if the loftiest, the freest, thefairest portions of my mind be eternallyliving and radiant in the supremegladness; they are no longer mine; I do notknow them. Death has cut the network ofnerves or memories that connected themwith I know not what centers wherein liesthe point which I feel to be my very self.They are thus set loose, floating in spaceand time; and their fate is as alien to me asthat of the most distant stars.All that befalls has no existence for meunless I can recall it within that- 88 -mysterious being which is I know notwhere and precisely nowhere and which Iturn like a mirror about this world whosephenomena take shape only insofar asthey are reflected in it. 50The discerning reader will note that nothing inthe above reconciliation is either obscure or elusive.It is simple, succinct, self-evident. 51Further it is unemotional: The author has nodesire or agenda to destroy Rosicrucianism, orAMORC particularly. Quite the contrary: The entirePart II of this book seeks to replace this invalidnonsense with valid sense, on the presumption thatsuch is entirely possible, and that AMORC has thebest RHP potential to actualize it.c.Prehumous PracticesThis side of the grave, what can be saidconcerning AMORC’s personal teachings andcommunity presence?As summarized above, the Monographs teachhigh-school-level natural science, healthy personal50 Maeterlinck, Maurice, Our Eternity. New York: Dodd, Mead,1914, pages #50-51.51 Anyone unable, unwilling, or undisposed to see mightprofitably consider switching allegiance from El to the dæmon-sultan god Azathoth, patron of bot both blindness and idiocy,who bubbles and blasphemes amidst Cosmic Chaos, lulled byloathsome flute-freakwencies. There’s a suitable religion foreveryone.- 89 -habits, and a sprinkling of harmless, fluffy-bunnyWhite Magic52 along the way.From the very first “Postulant” Monograph,AMORC also encourages non-feather-rufflingcommunity behavior; the Monographs are intendedfor “inner fulfillment” rather than social activism.Unsurprisingly conversation on AMORC’sInternet Members’ Forum tends to the pleasantly-social: this or that Atrium having a meeting or party.Questions concerning ideology or theology are rare,and either unanswered or referred to a Monograph.As a social club for people who simply enjoy thefantasy of “secret teachings”, AMORC seems bothprolific - with local “Atriums” in locales throughoutthe Americas - and harmless.While the organization doesn’t disclose ordiscuss membership details, I’d guess that itspredominant demographic is White, middle-class,high-school graduate, middle-age, more-or-lessevenly between the sexes. In short, “occultPleasantville”.H. Magic1.UniversesAMORC, like its Rosicrucian predecessors,concerns itself with two experiential environments52 White Magic (WM) consists of efforts to deceive oneselfand/or others into believing in whole or partial communicationwith/acceptance by El. This WM includes both ritual and non-ritual activities of slave-religions and RHP organizations, aswell as individual expressions such as prayers, saying Grace,and meeting invocations. WM is intrinsically impotent, but canbe used for substantial propaganda impact.- 90 -or “Universes”: the [single] Objective (OU), and[multiple, individual] Subjective (SU).a. ObjectiveThe OU is the single, collectively-experiencedenvironment of matter and energy external to eachindividual consciousness. It is the creation andmanifestation of the neteru (Plato’s “Forms”,Ayesha’s “principles of nature”), or collectively “El”.The authorship, the energy, and the continuedexistence of the neteru are proven prima facie bythe omnipresence and omnipotence of the OU’s“rules of operation”, aka NL. 53Each isolate human self-consciousness (theeightfold Egyptian MindStar54, or monosimplified“soul”) looks out on the OU through thephysiological media of the brain & body, therebydifferentiating “what it is” from “what it is not”.In the interests of completeness, the OU alsoconsists of an equal displacement of antimatter/energy, which balances the “positive” and enablesthe existence of “something out of nothing”: 0=+1-1.OU phenomena exist in 3 Dimensions ofdisplacement (length, width, height), to whichmotion between OU components adds the 4th ofduration (“time”). D1-3 are absolutes. D4 is avariable, relative to two or more D1-3s; that is thetrue meaning of relativity. 5553 The word “nature” derives from the original Egyptian neter.54 Cf. Michael A. Aquino, MindStar.55 For a detailed discussion of both OU & SU Dimensions, seethe author’s book FindFar.- 91 -b. SubjectiveEach soul [hereinafter using the Rosicruciansimplification] exists externally to the OU, enablingperspective upon it.This same externality requires the soul tocreate an approximate “vision” of the OU to renderit intelligible, coherent. This external perspectiveconstitutes an additional, 5th Dimension. 56This 5D model includes interpretations,æsthetics, and perhaps creative embellishmentsconceived by the originating soul; it is thus aSubjective Universe (SU), unique to that creativegenius.It follows that there are as many SUs, eachunique, as there are 5D perspectives. Indeed anindividual of extraordinary creativity, for example amusician or a painter, may generate an indefinitepalette of SUs.When humans communicate with one another,even when they think they are discussing the OU,what they are actually comparing, contrasting, andevaluating are their respective SU perspectives. Witheffort to minimize individual preferences andaccessories, they can approach, if never completelyachieve agreed-upon “objectivity”.2. Language and Toolsa. Objective UniverseThe structure and mechanisms - NL - of the OUare omnipresent and immutable. Thus NL need only56 Accurately and presciently termed “imagination” by RodSerling in his 1950s television series The Twilight Zone.- 92 -be discovered, established through repetition (the“laboratory method”), codified, and used: science.Appropriately the language of science is fixed,structured, sufficiently tied to OU phenomena that itshares their phenomenological consistency andreliability: mathematics, chemistry, physics, etc.Non-scientific language can be and is used todialogue and speculate concerning the OU. In“respectable, academicing” settings, however, effortis made not to venture far afield from known,scientific laws and theories accepted as laws.b. Subjective UniverseTo the extent that SUs are constructedreasonably and rationally, the tools of science andthe language of logic can be applied therein as well,somewhat less reliably than in the OU, of course.But SUs can also differ extraordinarily fromOU “reality”, and as they do, their tools andlanguage stray commensurately from science andlogic.At the imaginative and creative extreme offantasy, the language and tools depart completely aswell; now they exist in a reality of their own. This isthe realm of magic.Defined in this specific context and application,magic is “the art and science of causing change inaccordance with will” 57.Within the completely malleable SU it isequally fluid and free, simply providing a means fordisplaying, discussing, and enjoying the creativeinfinite. Friedrich Nietzsche referred to this as “thebuilding of horizons” [beyond the known], and in57 Aleister Crowley’s famous definition.- 93 -the visual arts of the Decadents, Surrealists,Expressionists, and Art Deco Modernists it finds itsvisual sensory extreme, as in literature with thepoetry of Clark Ashton Smith 58 and JamesThomson59, and the prose of Lord Dunsany, EdgarAllan Poe, H. Rider Haggard, Jules Verne, BramStoker, Abraham Merritt, and H.P. Lovecraft.Dwelling and wandering amidst such purefantasia, magic is “completely at home”: an artisticand sensual interpretation and accentuation of itssurroundings. And indeed as such, no moreremarkable than an artist’s paintbrush.c.Cross-Universal ColorsBut what happens when magic invades the OU?Most immediately it gains “colors”: White Magic(WM) and Black Magic (BM).Before proceeding further, it is important tonote that these terms are defined completelydifferently by the RHP and the LHP.3. RHP WM/BMAMORC considers WM & BM to be moral (e.g.good/evil) intent-classifications.Furthermore they are both applicationsprojected externally on other people orsituations.Thus you do WM in order to help someone, BMto harm. It is essential to note that all suchprojections are into the OU using the SU-language58 Cf. “The Hashish-Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil”.59 Cf. “The City of Dreadful Night”.- 94 -of magic. Once again, it is this act of projectionwhich creates the “coloration”.a. WMThe best-known WM employed by AMORC isits “Council of Solace”, a single or group “projectionof health and healing”. At Rosicrucian Park theGrand Temple is opened daily at noon specificallyfor this WM rite. Throughout the Monographs thereare several other techniques for such purely-WMbeneficence. The same WM can be applied to oneselfas positive meditative efforts to improve one’sphysical or mental condition, both of whichobviously imply adjustment to one’s OU/physiology.Whether Rosicrucians can or should apply WMto effect OU change other than personal or others’health is not discussed in AMORC literature, nodoubt because it is problematic to determinechanges in externalities that are assuredly moral andnot just self-serving. During World War II RHPindividuals and groups in England famously usedWM to help defeat Nazi Germany. They hadconvinced themselves that this was morally good.But, if effective, it could have had smaller or greaterside-effects that were quite the other thing. 60Within individual or group SUs, AMORC doesnot consider that it is “practicing WM”, for thesimple reason that AMORC doctrine considers all of60 In The Lord of the Rings, in response to Frodo’s regret thatBilbo hadn’t slain Gollum, the wizard Gandalf said, “Many thatlive deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you giveit to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the nameof justice, fearing for your own safety. Even the wise cannot seeall ends.” [Ultimately it was Gollum who completed the quest.]- 95 -metaphysics to be El-ordained, hence only to beaccepted and obeyed, not rejected or altered. 61b. BMIn this ominous precariousness it is hardlysurprising that Rosicrucians should have a specialhorror of BM, so much so that they dare not open itsbook62 even enough to examine the table ofcontents. Accordingly their warning concerning ithas nothing to do with its actual essence andapplication, but merely with nightmares more suitedto the Brothers Grim:Black MagicBefore answering these questions, we mustfirst ask ourselves if it is true that some peopleseek to do evil by means of the creative power ofthought.Unfortunately, we are forced to acknowledgethat such is the case. There do exist someindividuals who are known as “black magicians”who engage in practices intended to harm thevictims they have chosen or who have beenindicated to them.Their ways of operating differ. Some of themuse incantations or curses—magical words - which,according to them, possess the power to unleashdemons and evil spirits against someone.Others make mysterious gestures and assertthat these gestures set into motion destructivefluids capable of sowing unhappiness and grief.Still others use photographs, effigies,statuettes, or various other objects and, throughtheir mediation, claim that they can kill their61 This is established most didactically in the “RosicrucianOntology” stated by Grand Mistress Julie Scott, discussedherein.62 Indeed probably not this one on the same rationale.- 96 -victims, drive them mad, make them ill, burn theirhomes, destroy their herds, etc.Indeed, each of these servants of evil has his orher own technique, and, whether through words orgestures, or even both at the same time, it is basedmost of all upon the power of the mind.The question is, can this power be usedeffectively to destructive ends?63Further complicating the issue is AMORC’sinternational Imperator, on one hand proclaimingthat the Order’s policy is one of “the greatesttolerance within the strictest independence”; heexplicitly includes “all cultural, religious, andphilosophical movements” in this “tolerance” andadds that “each Rosicrucian is free to belong to anyother movement”, qualifying only that he “cannot letit interfere with his Rosicrucian affiliation”. 64But then on the other hand, the Imperator onceagain warns that “all” does not mean all. Excludedare “sects” so heinous he dare not name them65,“sorcery and Black Magic (for evil, harmfulpurposes)” 66, obviously outraging “morality” 67 and disdaining “compliance withnational law” 68.Grand Mistress Scott’s and ImperatorBernard’s shared predicament is that to talkknowledgeably about BM, they would have toendanger their initiation by actually studying the63 AMORC Monograph 13, First Atrium.64 Bernard, Christian, Questions & Answers. San Jose:AMORC, page #19.65 Ibid., page #14.66 Ibid., page #67.67 Ibid., page #70.68 Ibid., page #89.- 97 -stuff. 69 [Should either be reading this book, it mightbe prudent to page-turn past the following LHPelucidation.]4. LHP WM/BMTo briefly illustrate how substantially authenticMagic differs from AMORC superstition, thefollowing is extracted from introductory documentsof the Temple of Set:It is the curse and the blessing of humanity toexist simultaneously in two worlds: that of thetangible real and that of the intangible ethereal.Unlike all other animals we are not content withphysical life’s sensations; despite sober argumentand methodical science we never quite believe that“this is all there is” to our existence. We are drawn,some gently, as in fantasy and dream, some moreinsistently and passionately, to - something else,something greater, something that lifts our beingand our significance clear out of nature, farbeyond the realms of atoms and molecules: anmagnificent mælstrom of gods and daemons forwhom “reality” is but a poor crutch for brutes onthe periphery of their much larger universe.If the mystic is content to dream about thisother universe and the artist to convey glimpses ofit in music, paint, or pen, it is the passion of themagician to interact with it. The magician seeksto draw its presence and power into the lesserworld, to change that world by its touch.The magician fumbles at this. There are noordinary tools Here that he can reliably applyThere, and the great rays of the gods that flow soinexorably and thrillingly through “nature” are just69 One sympathizes: The U.S. Supreme Court was able toestablish “redeeming social value” in cases of allegedpornography only after sampling examples agreed to bescandalously irredeeming. These promptly soared in publicpopularity - doubtless precipitating a national karmiccatastrophe.- 98 -as elusive. They are to be glimpsed out of thecorner of one’s eye, unexpectedly. The magicianstruggles to fashion new and different tools forcontrol which he, in his semblance as sentient,natural man-beast, can use reliably andrepeatedly, as one would a wrench or hammer.To non-magicians his efforts may appearbewildering, even foolish. They are illogical. Theydon’t make sense. They are but “melted into thinair”. Perhaps they are even harmful in that theyentice others into the same useless folly, drainingenergy which might better be put to serious,practical labor. The magician may thus findhimself ignored as an irrelevant eccentric, perhapseven ostracized as someone dangerously insane.Yet he continues with his great work, hissearch for tools. Sometimes he thinks he hasindeed found or fashioned just such a differentkind of wrench or hammer, and he writes downdescriptions of it and instructions for its use.Sometimes other magicians, in their quest fortools, come across what he has written and try hisideas for themselves. And sometimes they indeedseem to work, and so another brick has beenadded to the bridge between Here and There. Letus now examine, and perhaps venture out uponthat bridge.The Temple of Set defines magic according totwo general categories: White and Black. Thesehave precise meanings which may quite differentfrom the way the terms are casually used bynonSetians. To begin with, neither category isinherently “good” or “evil”; the categoriesencompass techniques only. Either may be usedfor intentionally or unintentionally beneficial orharmful purposes.A. White MagicConventional religious ritual is a device forautohypnosis of the celebrant and varying degreesof mass-hypnosis for the audience. The mechanicalliturgies have a relaxing, dulling effect upon themind, placing it in the ( alpha-wave) mood mostreceptive to the conditioning (i.e. the sermon orother main body of the ritual).- 99 -White Magic (WM) is a highly-concentratedform of such ritual. The practitioner seeks a focusof his awareness and powers of concentration viaan extreme degree of autohypnosis. The techniquem a y b e u s e d s i m p l y f o r m e d i t a t i o n o rentertainment through mental imagery (“astralprojection”). Or it may be used to focus the willtowards a desired end - a cure, curse, etc. Toaccomplish this, the magician envisions a god ordæmon with the power to achieve the goal, thenconcentrates his will into an appeal. The god ordæmon then carries out the appeal, more or lesseffectively - depending upon the strength of themagician’s conviction of its power as a functioningentity.70From a Setian perspective, all conventionalreligious, and nonSetian “occult” ritualism fallsunder the heading of WM. Intrinsically it isinauthentic and impotent. Its power derives ratherfrom what it gets people to believe and do when itis used as a psychological individual- or mass-control device. Thus, for instance, any sort ofadvertising or propaganda is an application ofWM, though neither users nor targets may [andprobably wouldn’t] employ that term.B. Black MagicBlack Magic (BM) involves no autohypnosis orconditioning of the mind to make it receptive toinduced imagery. Thus, unlike White Magic, it isnot an exercise in self-deception. Rather it is adeliberate and conscious effort to force the mindoutward - to utilize and/or either perceptively oractually alter the “laws” of the Objective Universe(OU).Thus it is an action to “commit the same crimeagainst El (= OU consistency)” as did the Prince ofDarkness: to place one’s self deliberately apart anddistinct from the OU.Black Magic has two principal subcategories:Lesser (LBM) and Greater (GBM). These are70 Crowley, Aleister, Magick, pages #151-284. LaVey, Anton,The Satanic Bible, pages #110-152; The Satanic Rituals, pages#15-27.- 100 -detailed in the next two chapters. Following theseis a third chapter dealing with their blending,Medial (MBM).Ideally the magician should never use GBMwhen MBM will suffice, MBM when LBM willsuffice, nor LBM when intelligent, conventionalactions will suffice. Much of the effectiveness ofmagic is due to its exclusiveness, its esotericglamor. To overuse it, or to use it for vulgarpurposes, is to cheapen it. One does not use finechina to serve hot dogs for lunch. Keep magicsomething special in your life; consider it asacrament and a testament to the eternal majestyof your soul. Then you will find that it will dignifyand sanctify your being, and will raise you aboveprofane humanity. To echo Pythagoras: “Thoushalt be an immortal god, divine, no longermortal.” 71I.RosefingerGoldfinger’s flat, hard stare didn’t flicker. Hemight not have heard Bond’s angry-gentlemanoutburst. The finely-chiseled lips parted. He said,“Mr. Bond, they have a saying in Chicago: ‘Once ishappenstance. Twice is coincidence. The thirdtime it’s enemy action.’” 72I was naïvely insensitive to such subsurfacemagical icebergs when in 2009 I decided to joinAMORC. My motives were twofold:(1) Having realized [as in the Prefaceto this book] that Setian initiationis not only unsuited to the vast71 Aquino, Michael A., The Temple of Set (Volume I). SanFrancisco: Temple of Set, 2016, pages #209-11. For detaileddiscussions of the various types and applications of Magic, seeits subsequent chapters.72 Fleming, Ian, Goldfinger. New York: Signet, 1959, page#123.- 101 -majority of humans but indeeddangerous to it, I decided toinvestigate contemporary RHPinitiation to see if it might offer aviable alternative to the inadequacyof the conventional religiousinstitutions. I chose AMORC as themost substantial and structuredcandidate after first discardingFreemasonry as having relaxed intom e r e s o c i a l a n d c h a r i t a b l eaffability. Others seemed either tooculturally-concentrated, likeAsatru, or too controversial, likeOrdo Templi Orientis.(2) I am an unabashed Egyptophile,and I [mistakenly] assumed fromthe architecture of AMORC’s SanJose Park that its doctrines weresimilarly sourced. Enjoying thePark as I do, I further wished tobecome an official supporter aswell as admiring visitor.1.“Happenstance”I perused AMORC’s colorful Mastery of Lifebrochure, which assured me not only my modestgoals but also the wisdom of such notableRosicrucians as Pharaoh Akhenaten, Nostradamus,Leonardo da Vinci, and Roger Bacon. While I didn’tquite buy that, I was perfectly willing to consider theconverse: that these were personages whom AMORCadmired, and whose historical contributions onecould expect to see showcased accordingly.[index-102_1.png][index-102_2.jpg]- 102 -I was devastated. Akhenaten and Bacon werenot about to share their secrets with me after all.Polite letters of inquiry to the Membershipoffice, and then to Grand Mistress Julie Scottpersonally, all went unanswered.Finally telephoning the Membership Servicesoffice, I was informed by a pleasant lady that, whileAMORC never explains or justifies its rejections, inmy case I had been personally [dis]honored byTelephoning AMORC Membership Services, Iwas advised by a pleasant young lady that I wassingularly [dis]honored by having been personallyblackballed by no less a personage than the GrandMistress herself, “because of your religion”.This was even more mystifying, as The Masteryof Life had made it quite clear that AMORC itselfwas “not a religion”, and also that it welcomedapplicants of all religions. I could only suppose thatMs. Scott had had nightmares of the pastoralpeacefulness of Rosicrucian Park, and perhaps itsGrand Temple, being visited by the neter notoriousfor defending the celestial boat of Ra from Apophis:[index-103_1.jpg][index-103_2.jpg][index-103_3.jpg][index-103_4.jpg]- 103 -2. “Coincidence”Three years later, on 3/17/12, I decided to tryagain, this time through AMORC’s new Internet-direct process. To my pleasure I was immediatelyaccepted. Perhaps Ms. Scott has thought it over anddecided that Set wasn’t so scary after all?[index-104_1.jpg][index-104_2.png]- 104 -Key #8027874 enabled me to explore themembers’ area of the AMORC website, as well as tojoin the online Forum, wherein I contributed somecarefully plain-vanilla posts, was “befriended” byseveral participants nationwide, and was invited tovisit and speak at the San Francisco Atrium (as localchapters are called). Visiting the Park now as one ofits supporters and patrons, I passed through thegates of the members-only Akhenaten Shrine andadmired its ambient atmosphere.Rosicrucianism seemed rosy - until the GrandMistress suddenly noticed my Dread Name andmelted my cherished key.But before she did so, I had discovered that italso admitted me for private meditation to theGrand Temple in the Park:This imposing building, closed to the public,was built in the early 20th Century in the image ofthe Temple of the neter Hathor at Dendera:[index-105_1.jpg][index-105_2.jpg][index-105_3.jpg][index-105_4.jpg]- 105 -The interior of the Rosicrucian temple wasnothing short of breathtaking, creating the illusionof an open court beneath a starlit sky ceiling:It lacked only one thing: the presence of theneter herself.- 106 -At the time I did not realize that, paradoxically,this was a religious taboo to the staunchly Judæo-Christian AMORC. Unhesitatingly I invoked thegoddess:Adoration to you, Het-Hert, Mistress ofIunet, the august one in the sanctuaryof the august one.The one shining as gold in the sanctuary ofgold, the Atenet, eldest child of the Aten.I adore your majesty with your heart’sdesire; I exalt your ka to the height ofNut.I praise your manifestation to the limits ofthe rays of the Aten; I serve yourmajesty in your shrine.The powerful one, the great one, mistress offear, great of terror among the neteru.The horizon-dweller, mistress of heaven, thebrilliant one who creates the rays of theSun; the neteru rise early in themorning to pay you homage.Your beautiful face is satisfied by the king ofUpper and Lower Egypt, lord of theTwo Lands, beloved of the great Het-Hert, mistress of Iunet, the Eye of Ra.[index-107_1.jpg][index-107_2.png]- 107 -And of a sudden the temple was graced withher radiance, then presence, then appearance:Finally consecrated by and to its namesake, theGrand Temple would never again be an empty shell.I recounted the precise evocation to Ms. Scotton on April 24, 2012, suggesting that if she had anydoubts, she only need repeat the ceremony andincantation herself.I also warned her that, while generallyregarded as a rather fluffy-bunny goddess, Hathor is- 108 -nonetheless a notorious party girl [including adalliance with Set], and also has her bitchy side,suggesting that it might not be prudent to furtheruse her temple without due honor to her:There came a time in the Golden Age of theNeteru Dynasty when the Sun- neter Ra had grownold and frail; his bones were like silver, his skinlike burnished gold, and his hair like lapis lazuli.When the people of Egypt noticed Ra’sinfirmity, some murmured against him. Soonthere were plots to seize his throne.Ra overheard these, and his anger blazedforth as never before. “Summon my daughter, theEye of Ra; send for mighty Shu and Tefnut; bringtheir children Geb and Nut; fetch the DarkOgdoad, the eight who were with me in the WateryAbyss; raise Nun himself!”Ra addressed Nun: “O eldest of living thingsand all you primeval neteru, I wept and mensprang from my tears. I gave them life, but nowthey are tired of my rule and plot against me. Whatshould I do?”Watery Nun replied, “My son, you are olderthan your father, greater than the neter whocreated you. May you rule forever!“Both neteru and men fear the terriblepower of the Eye of the Sun; send it against therebels.”The other neteru cried out with one voice,“Send the Eye of Ra to seize and slaughter them!All of mankind is guilty; let the Eye go down asHathor and destroy the children of your tears. Letnone survive.”Hathor, the Eye of the Sun, most beautifuland terrible of neteru, bowed before the throne,and Ra nodded his assent.And so Hathor descended to the desert,raging like a lioness. The plotters attempted toescape her wrath, but to no avail. She seized them,slaughtered them, and drank their blood.Then merciless Hathor left the desert andraged through villages and towns, slaying everyoneshe found.- 109 -Ra heard the prayers and cries of the dyingand felt compassion for the children of his tears,but he remained silent.With the coming of darkness Hathorreturned to her father. Ra endeavored to calm her,but she had now tasted blood and only awaiteddawn to resume her vengeance.Unable to rescind his divine word, but heRadevised a plan to shield the rest of humanity fromhis terrible daughter. He ordered the brewing of agreat quantity of beer, adding ochre to it to turn itblood-red. It was poured to create a pool whereHathor would alight the following morning.At dawn Hathor descended; the first thingshe saw was the great pool, apparently of blood.Hathor was enchanted by her reflection inthe crimson surface. She knelt and drank the pooldry. The beer was strong, rendering Hathordelirious. She returned to the palace of Ra andsank down unconscious at her father’s feet.Ra smiled at his sleeping daughter:“Hereafter mankind shall show reverence to youby the drinking of strong beer at your festivals.”Nevertheless Ra was still angry at mankind’sdisrespect to him. When Hathor finally awoke dayslater, he asked her, “Does your head ache terribly,your cheeks burn, and your body convulse withillness?” When his daughter nodded in agony, Ratouched her head and she was instantly free fromthe mysterious affliction. “When men awake asyou did, this will remind them of their affront toRa from which only intoxication saved them. Butunlike yours it will linger long enough for divinepunishment.” And Ra laughed.Whether AMORC has since sought Hathor’spermission to borrow her temple for well-meaningbut nonetheless blatantly blasphemous rites andrevels devoted to the heathen Canaanite god El andhis El-ohim entourage, I cannot say - and am notcertain I would dare to discover.[index-110_1.jpg][index-110_2.jpg]- 110 -3. “Enemy Action”Again I allowed three years to pass beforetrying again. Still unaware of the Black Magicblacklist, I again assumed my previous unwelcomesto be nothing more than simple ignorance on thepart of the Grand Mistress concerning the actualethics of the Church of Satan and Temple of Set.Perhaps by now my elucidations had sunk in,dispelled her fear?For the next year and a half it seemed so. I wasreadmitted, given Key #49946, and received all ofthe introductory Postulant & Neophyte Monographswithout incident, in due course being confirmed as afull-fledged “Temple I°” in June 2016:7373 Being hospitalized for cancer operations during the sameperiod, I was unable to visit the San Jose Park or the GoldenGate (San Francisco) Atrium.- 111 -This gratifying certification was soon followedby elaborate monographic commemoration of thissublime status and stature from the internationalImperator in France:Respected Member:On this day on the Rosicrucian Path, I wish tooffer you my sincerecongratulations, for it is with zeal that youhave crossed the threshold giving access to thesymbolic Temple of our Order. From now on youwill be considered to be a member of the InitiateSection, rather than as a Neophyte ... May theCosmic forever sanctify your mystical quest andgrant you the inner joy of leading a life useful toyour own evolution and to the evolution of allhumanity.With best wishes for Peace Profound,Sincerely and fraternally,Christian BernardImperator74The Grand Mistress’ office in San Jose addedits compliments:Dear Fratres and Sorores,The fact that you are studying this ThresholdMonograph is proof in itself of your loyalty and ofthe attention you have given to the teachings of theNeophyte Section ...Then got down to “three important points”:(1) Membership dues don’t come close tocovering both the administrative andmaintenance costs at Rosicrucian Park,so please send donations and considerbequests in your will.74 Temple I° Monograph “Preliminary”.- 112 -(2) Similarly we need to aggressivelyincrease memberships. Please go outand recruit at least two in your first fewTemple I° months.(3) Enclosed you will find a document calledthe “Postulant’s Plea” ...After reading it attentively, you should sign itand send it as soon as possible to the Grand Lodge,to the attention of the Grand Mistress. Asmentioned previously, this “Plea”, whose variouspoints constitute no impediment to the freedom ofthought, word, or action mentioned above, will beplaced in your membership files. As long as youmaintain your affiliation, it will testify to yourstatus as a regular member of the Ancient andMystical Order Rosaæ Crucis. 75We’ll come back to the PP in a moment, butfirst a word or two about Points #1&2:As highlighted earlier in this book, RosicrucianPark is a jewel of a San Jose landmark. Its groundsand gardens are freely open to the public, andattractions such as the Egyptian Museum, theLibrary, and the Planetarium are as well. All areacademically-respectable, meticulously maintained,and courteously staffed. If AMORC did nothing elsebut preserve and operate this Park, it would morethan justify its existence.Even if the Egyptian facade is as commercially-superficial as that of the late-lamented Luxor, it is -like the Luxor in its original glory - tastefully so. Ifone wishes to tine-travel to the ambiance of the Nilethree thousand years ago, if only for an afternoon,here is that portal.75 Temple I° Monograph “Threshold”.- 113 -And with the demise of the Luxor, it is now theonly such portal in the world. Egypt itself today is ahorror of corruption, decadence, and grotesque,cynical tourist-exploitation of the few disintegrating“antiquities” it otherwise holds in baksheesh-contempt.So Rosicrucian Park fully merits preservation,by the public as well as AMORC membersthemselves. With this in mind, I decided to send theGrand Mistress a suggestion while doing this book:Even under Prop 1376 the property taxes onthat entire block must be substantial, and there arethe other state/federal tax hits as well. I don’tthink AMORC’s status as a California PublicBenefit Corporation exempts it from any of these.If AMORC reclassifies itself as an incorporatedchurch in California, property and most othertaxes cease.Also, as you may know, there are continuedrumblings in Sacramento about removingbusinesses from Prop 13 protections. Probably notimminent, but quite possibly down the road in thepresent political climate.Yes, I know that AMORC has long advertisedthat it is “not a religion”, presumably to appeaseconventional churches, though some still howl“cult”.My guess is that if you formalized as a religion,competitor opinions wouldn’t change significantly.And of course AMORC is a religion by anysensible definition: You state belief in El(=“Cosmic”), require obedience to its “laws\",represent AMORC as its agency and interpreter.It’s Judaic Cabalism - the “Tree of Life” GoldenDawn path - with related prayers and rituals, and76 In 1978 California voters passed Proposition 13, immediatelyrolling-back property taxes 57% and limiting future increasesto 3%/annum. In recent years there has been increasingpressure to remove commercial businesses from thisprotection, annually reassessing them at current market value.- 114 -Martinism 77 added for those wanting a formalJesus option. The only strict departure from bothJudaism and Christianity is your Hindu Earthly-reincarnation doctrine, which you’re sort of stuckwith through all the Temple+ degrees. It certainlyclashes with J/C; I suppose Lewis78 just borrowedit from HPB79 without thinking it through - thetar-baby from which I was trying to unstick you onthe Forum. Oh, well …80O b v i o u s l y A M O R C a b j u r e s E g y p t i a nmetaphysics: just enjoys the historical museumand Park architecture.All of which is to suggest that you considerformally reincorporating as a church (the legalterm). Your history and practices should suffice forIRS & CA Franchise Tax Board church-exemption.That would eliminate a massive tax burden.Would it upset the existing membership, whowere told “non-religion” when they joined? Youcould always poll them, but I predict it would not77 Martinism describes organizations and concepts in Christianmysticism focusing on man’s fall from Eden and initiatoryredemption, aka “illumination”. It originated with the FrenchFreemason Martinez de Pasqually, inspiring BavarianFreemason Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati in 1776. AMORC’sfirst two Imperators, Harvey & Ralph Lewis, joined one of the20th-century versions, the French Ordre Martiniste etSynarchie (OM&S), succeeded in 1931 by the Ordre MartinisteTraditionnel (OMT), which in 1939 Ralph brought to AMORCas its Traditional Martinist Order (TMO). Martinism, as analternative to mainstream Freemasonry’s cooptation of theKnights Templar, soothes the disquiet that Masons andRosicrucians would otherwise feel with a Jewish-Cabalisticideology. For this very reason Rosicrucianism and Martinismare mutually-exclusive, but it’s not politic to mention this.78 AMORC’s founder Harvey Spencer Lewis.79 Helena Petrovna Blavatsky: 19th-century Russian occultistwho founded the Theosophical Society; she advocated Earthlyhuman reincarnation as per Buddhism & Hinduism.80 It was this blasphemous post of mine (Appendix #1) that sooutraged Ms. Scott as to expel me peremptorily from AMORCyet again, as will be detailed in due course.- 115 -be a problem. As above, AMORC already behavesas a de facto religion, and everyone knows it. Anyoutside religious conflicts are long sincerationalized by members. If anything, you mightfind a general sense of relief at not having tobother with the facade any longer.Not to mention that once you’re a church withfederal 501/c/3 and the related FTB OK, all yourmembers can take donations to AMORC off theirtaxes, which means more to you under that samePoint #1. 81Ostensibly that such a reincorporation andexemption would be both honest and authentic.There are cases of fraternal or social organizationswho have sought to restyle themselves as “religions”ostensibly just to obtain First Amendmentimmunities and tax-advantages; the re-christened“Church of Scientology” is one dubious example. ButAMORC has an argument that is not in the leastdishonest or deceptive.With religious considerations in mind, it’s nowappropriate to examine “Point #3”: the “Postulant’sPlea”, the oath that every new admitee to fullTemple I° membership is exhorted to sign andreturn to Ms. Scott personally.Occult secret societies are famous forintimidating initiation ceremonies and ominousoaths with dire consequences - all of which hasfaded into comic caricature in modern times.AMORC’s PP is something like that: the formaloath of loyalty and secrecy upon the initiate’sconfirmation to the full-membership “Temple”degrees. Unfortunately it isn’t just florid ceremonial,but arguably “a step too far” in terms of its demands,restrictions, and expectations. The PP’s saving graceis that it is optional, with a “conscience” caveat.81 Letter, M. Aquino to Julie Scott, October 1, 2017.[index-116_1.jpg][index-116_2.png]- 116 -Read literally, it is difficult to imagine asurrender of one’s dignity, intellect, and freedommore complete and abject than as demanded by thisdraconian, aptly-named “Plea”. Yet this is the idolbefore which all Rosicrucians of the Temple andhigher degrees are sworn to abase themselves.AMORC’s “Postulant’s Plea”:• Demands belief in a monotheistic El(“the Cosmic”) as human taskmaster.- 117 -• Defines the individual’s relationship toAMORC as one of “humble obligation”,without any mention of reciprocity. Thisamounts to voluntary slavery, pure andsimple.• Requires acceptance of the “sacredblessings” of El, swearing (personal“sacred purpose”) to live according toAMORC’s “laws, te achings, anddecrees”, and to constantly and activelypublicize and promote these.• Requires similarly indoctrinating(“instill a love for these things in”) one’schildren.• Requires similarly “extension ofinstruction” to “ignorant” relatives andfriends.While signing and returning this “Plea” isnominally optional, the implication is quite clearthat it is a “rite of passage” for confirmation asTemple I° and all higher degrees. The “Point #3”emphasis accorded it implies that its absence inone’s personal file would be conspicuous, to say theleast.Also significantly, neither the existence nor thewording of the PP is disclosed to the pre-Templeaffiliate during his 1-1/2 years of “Postulant/Neophyte” instruction. Either he accepts it tocontinue, or faces the disheartening prospect ofthrowing the better part of two previous years’ timeand effort into the wastebasket. It is a mostunpleasant surprise indeed.- 118 -The Monograph’s reassurance that the PP ismerely a reaffirmation of the earlier “NeophyteOath” is ludicrous. That Oath reads:Alone with my conscience, in the invisiblepresence of the Masters of our Order and underthe Supreme Sight of the Divine Intelligence thatworks upon all levels of Universal Creation, at themoment I prepare to pass through the First Portalof the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis,conscious of the importance of this moment andguided by the values that my understandingconsiders to be the most sacred, I solemnly declareto subscribe to the following oath and promise toobserve each of the points:First: As a Neophyte of AMORC, I promise tostudy zealously its sacred and secret teachings, todevote sufficient time to meditate on the mysticallaws and principles that have been transmitted tome, and to apply the knowledge that I will acquire,so as to receive Illumination and to gain access tothe Mastery of life.Second: As a citizen of the world and amember of the human family, I promise to doeverything within my power to lead a life inconformance with the highest ideals; to use thewisdom that will be transmitted to me to serve theinterests of humanity; to reflect the noblest virtuesin my thoughts, words, and actions; and tocontribute to the cultural, moral, and spiritualadvancement of the country in which I reside. 82Third: I promise to respect the fundamentalrules of AMORC, which rest on the promise that Ihave made to consider as confidential theteachings that have been transmitted to me, aswell as the symbols, signs, and passwords that willbe revealed to me during my affiliation; to complywith the instructions that I may receive from theGrand Lodge, knowing that these will alwaysrespect my freedom of conscience; and to always82 Indeed the NO’s “Second Point” virtually demands thewriting of this book to correct AMORC’s departures from itsprofessed commitment to the betterment of humanity.- 119 -hold in high regard the integrity of the Order andthe ideals which animate each of its members.So Mote It Be!***Note: As our Order is a school emphasizingfreedom of conscience, the preceding oathc o r r e s p o n d s p r i m a r i l y t o a t r a d i t i o n a lcommitment - that is, a commitment to yourself.Thus, if you find one of the points unacceptable toyour convictions, you are entirely free not tosign the document. 83So the NO contains nothing of the PP’stotalitarian demands - indeed bends over backwardsto emphasize that it is merely suggestive.Since AMORC holds itself so morally superiorto the LHP, it’s pertinent to consider the confirmed-membership oaths of the 1966-75 Church of Satanand 1975+ Temple of Set:Church of SatanTemple of SetNone.None.In short, in both of these LHP institutions, theindividual is accorded absolute, unconditionalpersonal respect and responsibility. Bothinstitutions expect the highest standards of personalethics, prohibit religious/initiatory indoctrination ofminors, and never solicit affiliations or conversions.As gentle readers doubtless anticipate, my ownimmediate reaction to the PP combined incredulitywith revulsion. Signing such a document seemedout-of-the-question. Yet I wished to stayconstructively involved with AMORC, whichnecessitated confirmation into Temple membership.My dilemma was solved when I noticed theincluded caveat: “It is understood that I will never83 Atrium I Monograph “Rosicrucian Initiation”.- 120 -be asked to do anything which violates the dictatesof my conscience.” So I signed, fully expecting thatmy omnipresent, incorruptible, and irresistibleJiminy Cricket84 would not only preserve my ownintegrity but probably not rest until the PP had beenthoroughly fumigated for all Rosicrucians.On 6/29/16 I sent the PP back to Ms. Scottwith no repercussions, though in retrospect Isuspect that the AMORC office just tosses these intoone’s file-folder without bothering the GrandMistress.4. Extremely Prejudicial Terminationa. Egyptian ImmortalityIn July 2016 I rejoined AMORC’s members’forum.Later that month forum member DameonKeller posted several questions concerningAMORC’s assertions of Earthly reincarnation perthe Hindu model. For days no one answered him, soon 8/7/16 I decided to.As previously noted herein, AMORC’s Hindu-reincarnation doctrine suffers from severalproblems, not the least of which is its hereticalincompatibility with El-monotheism. Keller broughtup two of these:84 Jiminy Cricket is Walt Disney’s version of The TalkingCricket (Italian Il Grillo Parlante), created by Carlo Collodi forhis story The Adventures of Pinocchio. Jiminy received hisfamous name for Walt’s 1940 movie, in which the Blue Fairy(originally Carlo’s “fairy with turquoise hair”) appointed himthe puppet’s official conscience.- 121 -(1) The imbalance between thenumber of people dying andthose being born, as well as theexponential expansion of worldpopulation.(2) The blanking of identity (e.g.memory) when reincarnated.Why should this happen, andwhat is the point of worryingabout karma in this life if thereis no recollection and learningin the next one?Neither the original Hindu texts norBlavatsky’s borrowing from them, nor AMORC’sborrowing from her resolve either problem.Nor could I from within Hinduism, but it wasnot a problem within Egyptian metaphysics. TakingAMORC at its word that it was “non-doctrinal” andreligion-tolerant, I answered from the Egyptianperspective.Even attempting to be forum-brief, it could notbe cursory if it were to address the topic adequately.But there were no restrictions concerning post-length, and of course anyone uninterested couldeasily ignore it.Indeed that post is too extensive to fit easilyinto this narrative, so it is included as Appendix #1.Here follows a summary of its main points:• The Egyptian schematic of individualimmortality requires an understanding of theeight-emanation MindStar (in place of thelater simplification of a singular “soul” - towhich modern humanity is accustomed, to- 122 -the extent it even credits the existence of ametaphysical self).• Humans are conditioned to consider the selfmerely the product of the five senses, throughfamiliarity and laziness. However it exists intheir absence, as demonstrated by medicalanæsthesia and sensory-deprivationexperiments. 85• Plato demonstrated the immortality of theself (Egyptian ba, Greek psyche, GoldenFlower of the Tao86), in the Meno, wherein heexplains the faculty of anamnesis87, retainingidentity and knowledge at the suprasensorylevel of nœsis (later Immanuel Kant’s “pure85 Cf. The Deep Self by John C. Lilly, M.D. NY: Warner Books#33-023, 1977. Lilly achieved prominence [or notoriety] as theprincipal proponent of, and experimentor with the sensorydeprivation tank. This book summarizes and analyzes thefindings of his earlier books and reports, and offers practicalguidance concerning the construction and use of isolationtanks. Lilly, who along with his work was portrayed in the 1980film Altered States, comments: “In the province of the mind,what one believes to be true either is true or becomes truewithin certain limits. These limits are to be found experientallyand experimentally. When the limits are determined, it isfound that they are further beliefs to be transcended. In theprovince of the mind, there are no limits. The body imposesdefinite limits.”86 Cf. The Secret of the Golden Flower by Thomas Cleary(Trans.). San Francisco: Harper, 1991. A classic of ChineseTaoism describing the process of the attainment oftranscendental existence by the means of creating a mandalafrom the personal subconscious.87 The post defines anamnesis at length, quoting ProfessorRaghavan Iyer (D.Phil. Oxford), internationally-renownedClassical scholar and author. A link to his works was provided.- 123 -reason”, Friedrich Nietzsche’s “horizonbuilding”).• The eight emanations of the EgyptianMindStar are listed and summarized. Ofthese the ba is the locus of the immortal self-consciousness, and exists independent of thephysical body both during and before/afterits temporary use as an OU-interface. Thusthere is no necessary, inevitable, or enforcedbodily reincarnation per Hindu superstition,and the notion of karma is similarlyimaginary: the Eastern version of WesternHeaven/Hell sadomasochistic theocracy. Thisis why both the imbalance of human births/deaths and the absence of a fictitiously-assumed “reincarnated soul memory” areirrelevancies.b. “Materially & SeriouslyPrejudicial Conduct”Curious to see how senior Rosicrucians mightattempt to justify Hindu reincarnation and addressKeller’s questions accordingly, I checked back thenext day - only to find my forum access blockedwithout explanation. Repeated inquiries to themoderator went unanswered.On 8/9/16 Dameon Keller noticed that myforum profile had vanished and emailed me: “Howstrange ... I found your reply quite enlightening, anddid appreciate it greatly. I will inquire to them as towhat exactly the issue was, and let you know whatthey say.”Keller never received an answer either.- 124 -Three days later a letter arrived from anunnamed - and thereafter completely unresponsive,except when Ms. Scott personally answered “their”mail:The Board of Directors has determined thatyou have engaged in conduct materially andseriously prejudicial to AMORC's interests andpurposes, and terminates your membership onthat basis.88This “materially and seriously prejudicialconduct” was later specified by Ms. Scott to be theforum post:Mr. Aquino's removal from the on-lineforum as well as from AMORC was on account ofhis conduct. In a membership forum, Mr. Aquinochose to dominate the forum by posting an eight-page, single-spaced soliloquy about his specificsbeliefs, which included embedded external linksfor further information.His conduct violated AMORC's specificrules; but it was also inconsistent with exhibitingan interest in AMORC's teachings as opposed toanother ulterior motive. 89As is obvious from the forum post, I nowheresolicited or even mentioned my own religion - nor, ifAMORC were indeed tolerant of all religions, wouldthis have been forbidden.The only link provided was to the writings ofDr. Raghavan Iyer (no Temple of Set connection).Nor were there any limits on post lengths.88 Letter, “AMORC Board of Directors” to Mr. M. Aquino,8/12/16.89 Email AMORC attorney Simone sMcCorick 2/17/17.- 125 -So the inescapable conclusion is that Ms. Scottcould not endure even the possibility that AMORCdoctrine concerning El-monotheism and Hindu-reincarnation is factually false. And so absolute washer intolerance that a follow-up forum post by herdissenting from mine was not considered; onlyimmediate and complete expulsion would suffice.AMORC “religious tolerance” means nothing.Temple-membership also means nothing interms of membership security or tenure.J. The Twelve CommandmentsOrthodox Judaism is noted for its “TenCommandments” given by El to Moses on MountSinai.AMORC has Twelve, announced as “AMORCOntology” by Grand Mistress Scott on theforum in 2012. An examination of themfurther documents its articles of religiousfaith:Rosicrucian Ontology 901. God is the Universal Intelligence thatthought, manifested, and animated all90 Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being,becoming, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categoriesof being and their relations. In so titling these twelve “laws”,Scott thus establishes both principles and boundaries forAMORC’s entire interpretation of reality.- 126 -Creation according to unchanging perfectlaws. 912. All of Creation is permeated by a UniversalSoul that evolves toward the perfection of itsown nature. 923. Life is the vehicle for cosmic evolution, suchas it manifests in the universe and on Earth. 934. Matter owes its existence to a vibratoryenergy that is propagated throughout theentire universe and which permeates eachatom. 9491 In claiming knowledge of a monotheistic deity who hasestablished immutable universal laws, Scott not onlyestablished AMORC as a religion de jure, bur herself as highpriestess - a license beyond mere CEO of a fraternal society.92 In monograph Atrium 1-1, AMORC defines the term “spirit”as “the energy found in matter” [as juxtaposed to “soul”, whichis “non-material energy]. In her Law #2, therefore, Scottdirectly contradicts published AMORC doctrine.93 In prevalent scientific usage, “life” is defined as the conditionthat distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter,including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functionalactivity, and continual change preceding death. Quiteobviously, the physical universe (OU) undergoes considerable,continuous non-living evolution in addition to that of anyincluded living forms.94 In OU physics matter and energy are simplyinterchangeable; neither is “prior” to the other. Nor, of course,are all forms of energy “vibrations”: Oscillations constituteonly the electrical portion of the Electromagnetic Spectrum;the magnetic energy is manifest in fields, not waves.- 127 -5. Time and space are states of consciousnessand do not have any material realityindependent from humans. 956. The human being is a double being in his orher nature and triple in her or hismanifestation. 967. The soul incarnates in the body of the child atthe first inhalation, making the child a livingand conscious being. 9795 “Space” per se is OU-nonexistence: a vacuum. The existenceof objects in space is established by the first three dimensions(length, width, height). Dimension 4 (“Time”) is ameasurement of change between specific D3 phenomena; suchchange occurs independent of human perception. Such humanperception (D5) is necessarily external to D1-4. [Thesedimensions are discussed in detail in my book FindFar.]96 Scott simplifies the human body as a combination of twoAMORC-jargon energies - “Soul” and “Spirit” - which require athird - “Vital Life Force” deliberate injection by El for eachfœtus to live. ( Atrium 2-1) The first two terms AMORC merelyassumes rather than attempts to prove, and “VLF” is simplyunnecessary, as observation of cellular division & reproductionsuffices to demonstrate.97 AMORC, like its Judæo-Christian models, fails utterly toidentify/define “soul” beyond vague generalities. The ancientEgyptians examined metaphysical self-consciousness carefully,detailing it as the eightfold Emanations discussed in my bookMindStar. [Cf. also Appendix #1 herein.] This same expositionindicates the absurdity of suggesting that a newborn’s firstbreath has anything to do with ‘possession” of a bodily vehicle.In actuality the MindStar is a field-phenomenon enveloping,not inhabiting any physical body of temporary utility.- 128 -8. Our destiny is determined by the manner inwhich we apply our free will and by thekarma resulting from this. 989. Death occurs with a human being’s lastbreath and results in the final separationbetween the body and the soul. 9910. The spiritual evolution of humans is ruled byreincarnation, and its ultimate purpose is toreach Perfection. 10098 “Destiny” and “free will” are mutually-exclusive concepts.“Destiny” is possible only in the absence of free will. Noramidst an OU of random hazard, and surrounded by otherdiscretionary, free-will Subjective Universes (SU), can anysentient entity completely determine its own future.The Hindu concept of karma applies only to the factually-false concept of bodily reincarnation, proposing that the sum-total of an individual’s prior-lives’ behavior determines thecurrent one. Hence karma is as irrelevant as the reincarnationfiction upon which it depends. Cf. Appendix #1 concerningEgyptian consciousness-immortality.99 The physical body is a composite of many OU metabolicprocesses, which disintegrate just as severally. Cessation ofmajor processes, such as those of the heart and brain, triggerand accelerate others, but do not actuate all instantaneously[which is why hair, fingernails, etc. continue to live on a“corpse”]. Similarly the eight MindStar Emanations separatefrom or remain with the body both prior and subsequent toorganic disintegration, as again detailed in MindStar.100 Here Scott confuses AMORC’s own definition of “spirit” vs.“soul”, as in primitive religions’ myths of karma it is the “soul”- not a body’s OU energy (AMORC’s “spirit”) - that is seekingperfection through progressive reincarnations. As above, thissimplistic notion of karma/reincarnation is utterly baseless -not to mention an example of AMORC’s confusion of Judæo-Christian doctrine with Hinduism.- 129 -11. There is a supra-human kingdom, formed byall the disincarnated souls populating theinvisible world. 10112. After completing its spiritual evolution, thesoul of each human being reintegrates withthe Universal Soul in all purity and lives inthe Divine Immanence in full conscious-ness. 102With its twelve major laws, this textsummarizes the Rosicrucian Ontology, meaningthe ideas Rosicrucians have about Creation ingeneral and humans in particular.Perhaps belatedly realizing that these TwelveCommandments emulate the Hebraic Ten a bit tooblatantly for AMORC’s religious-deniability, Ms.Scott hastened to append an unconvincing caveat:“We must nevertheless indicate that these laws arenot dogmatic.” How an announced “law” can be“non-dogmatic” she declines to explain.101 Such a nonsensical proposition helplessly follows from thecrude belief that individual “souls” are “cattle” collectivelycorralled within the single OU created by a J-C El. NeitherScott nor other conventional reincarnationists can imaginewhat else to do with this compounding overpopulation. Inactuality each MindStar, as it becomes self-aware, creates oneor more of its own eternal SUs, in which the OU of the neteru(NL/El/El-ohim) becomes just one of innumerable options.102 This reflects the nominal goal of Right-Hand Path initiation,which is [re]inclusion of the independent consciousness in thatof the OU-generating/maintaining consciousness from which itbelieves that it “fell away” by virtue of its distinct identity andexternal perspective. Such an OU-submergence is possible, butamounts to suicide of oneself in order to sleep forever indreamless oblivion. It is indeed a return to a pre-selfconsciousGarden of Eden, in which both the ecstasy and the terror ofunique existence are exchanged for ultimate, absolute Death.- 130 -And as my “Rosefinger” experience establishes,the consequence of even questioning this dogma isimmediate expulsion.K. EvaluationWhat the exploration recounted thus far in thisbook establishes is that, despite its success increating and maintaining a beautiful Egyptian-themed Park in San Jose, AMORC is a de factomonotheistic religion based on the Canaanite god Elcorruptions of the Hebrews, further corrupted bythe Hindu fictions of reincarnation and karma, andfurther corrupted by the “redemptive” fakery ofZohar Cabalism.The unfortunate but inescapable result of allthis is a superstitious mess of no consequencebeyond casual amusement.This is at once disappointing and challenging.Disappointing because the Park suggests the definitepotential for an underlying philosophical base andscholarship fully commensurate with its visualimpressiveness.Challenging because there is a real need for avalid and practical metaphysical curriculum ofpersonal ennoblement and evolution aligned to theneteru of the OU, superseding and retiring the evenmore lamentable Eastern and Western mass-religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam,Buddhism, and Hinduism. These “old detectivestories”, as John Fowles dismisses them, are not justutterly prima facie incoherent, but degraded bylegacies of ignorance, intolerance, intimidation, andmurder over the millennia of their sway. Only in thefew post-Enlightenment cultures wherein they havebeen reduced to mere pageantry do they not- 131 -continue as what can only be called a pandemic ofsadomasochistic degradation and destruction.Rosicrucianism in its best sense reflects theimpulse of non-Setian humanity to transcend itsbase animalism in favor of a more intellectual andæsthetic sense pf identity and self-respect. The veryability to envision true divinity implies the capacityto realize it in fact as well as in fantasy.In 13th-Century Spain this restless impulse ledMoses de Leon to attempt to wrest just such acurriculum from what he thought was the El-truth ofthe Tanakh; he failed not just because of his owndishonesty, but because he was working with adishonest premise.If Rosicrucianism is to be purified, therefore, itmust re-originate itself from a pure source. And inthe case of AMORC, this source literally surroundsit: the metaphysics of the neteru of ancient Egypt.From a Setian perspective this would seem tobe a simple, self-evident, and easy reformation. It isall too easy to forget the vise in which the “olddetective stories” hold nonSetian humanity by theirterror of death. Not until they have overcome thisaddiction can they feel free to achieve and embracetheir true immortality.Therefore the intent of Part II of this book isyet a third “guided tour”: this time not through thedelights of the Luxor or of Rosicrucian Park, but ofthe MindStar itself: the divinity latent in everysentient being, needing only Awakening.- 132 -[index-133_1.jpg]- 133 -"},{"pageContent":"PART IINEW DETECTIVE STORY- 134 -[index-135_1.png]- 135 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4: FIRST LECTUREREGENESISPh'nglui mglw'nafh Dagon Az’tlan wgah'naglfhtagn.Distinguished Deep Disciples of Dagon: May Ibegin these lectures by expressing my appreciationfor this rare invitation to a surface-scholar, as wellas my hope that you find the series sufficientlystimulating to permit my return to the murkymausolea of Miskatonic in peace instead of pieces.It is no secret to this assemblage that religiousfear and superstition among the surface-humanoidshave endangered this more-civilized communityrepeatedly over the years; I hope to offer them aless-paranoid and destructive alternative for theirepistemological and emotional uncertainties.Religious criticism is usually an exercise ingratuitous demolition, the object of which is to leaveno audience alternative but agnosticism, if notoutright atheism.The ancient Greeks might well have disdainedsuch smug stupidity as hubris: arrogance so insolentas to rise to insult of the Olympians, for which theconsequent punishment was nemesis: a rebuke so- 136 -absolute and devastating that the lucklessperpetrator could never recover from it. 103Nevertheless I am also very much aware thatthe Great Old Ones need no provocation at all toobliterate surfacers, and are only incidentallyappeased by propitious rites, such that these asoften as not end in the slaughter of the suppliants.Indeed the implications of my researchsuddenly became clear when I realized that the“Canaanite” gods, including your own Dagon, werein fact Old Ones ( El-ohim) for which the temples atTell Ba’albek in the ante-L’ebanon were raised.It was the misfortune of the Habiru 104 tribes tochoose, or be chosen by El, the most bloodthirsty ofthe El-ohim, who thereafter enslaved andslaughtered them and their derivative Christian andMuslim cults to this day.Indeed one would think that El would longsince have been abandoned by his miserable slavesfor less savage and sadistic El-ohim such as Ba’al,Moloch, or of course your revered Dagon; I can onlyspeculate that El imposed such fear upon them as tomake them terrified of his retribution should he bedisrespected or disobeyed.The consequent purpose of my research hasbeen to formulate a methodology for surfacers to103 Such a fate befell King Œdipus, Psyche, Pandora, Icarus,Prometheus, Persephone, Callisto and other unfortunates -even if they intended no insult to the gods.

It is my belief that if this canbe done successfully, they will cease to search forgoats to scape, such as yourselves while you are asyet pre-transitional airbreathers.We will therefore start with the “blank stele” ofdark, incomprehensible nothingness surroundinghumanity, and bring coherence to the chaos.Absent a rational resolution of his spontaneoussensations, huMan perceives himself at theexperiential entrance to universal unintelligibility,his reaction to which is baffled bewilderment,contending with consuming curiosity. Fools, it issaid, rush in where wise men fear to tread. Yetsooner or later the wise take that cautious first step.- 138 -A. Defining the IndefinableReligion is an approximate and intuitivelanguage for acknowledging and expressingthe perceived existence of a self-consciousentity as distinct from externality.Most precisely this might be termed “consciousindependence”.In customary usage both “theology” and“religion” imply a primal, supernatural causality,though as we will see, such an assumption isunnecessary to either. “Prior cause” is essential onlywithin a linear-time model, which is only one ofseveral schematics, and by no means the one eithermost probable or most practical.B. Refinements1. Separation?No, because “separation” presupposes a prior,sundered unity, and we have no evidence supportingsuch an assumption. Conscious individuality is not“something broken” aka “original sin”.It is convenient to conclude that because OUmetabolism utilizes cellular division, the sameprocess can be extrapolated to consciousness.Obviously personalities do not “split” that way.2. Non-Conscious?No, because juxtaposition cannot be perceived,nor the question of its situation conceived or posedabsent a discriminatory intelligence. It is onlythrough consciousness that a distinct entity can benot “just itself”, but aware of itself.- 139 -3. Theological?Not axiomatically: that would presuppose aprior, absolutely-external consciousness conceivingand ordering the OU: once again a God or gods.While we may ultimately come to such a conclusion,the initial question cannot explicitly or implicitlyassume it on the mere bases of existence anddistinction. [Assuming “prior cause” again defaultsto the linear-time model, which is not inevitable.]4. Religion?One may be tempted to object to the use of theterm “religion” on the same grounds as “theology”:Both customarily imply, as per Webster’s: “theservice and worship of God or the supernatural”.These lectures use “religion” in the morecautious and precise language in #A above.Additionally the term implies non-limitation to theexclusively-OU, opening the door to metaphysics -not the blind jump into God/s-superstition, butflexibility for the concept to go beyond merelaboratory-replication mechanism.As we proceed, we will both expand and refine“religion” until it meets the test of nœtic, absoluteTruth.5. Exclusive?In Platonic cosmology reality extends fromprimal, pre-universal Truths or Forms (the ancientEgyptian neteru), of which both metaphysical andphysical manifestations of existence are projectionsor particularizations. We, like Plato, reject the banal,Postmodern “democratization of truth” as nonsense.- 140 -As these Forms exist above and beyond the OUof physics, to which science is limited, they cannotbe perceived or recognized by direct observation,reason, or deduction (Platonic dianoia). Methodical,precise dianoia - the process of dialectic - can only[but necessarily] provide a jumping-off point for thehigher mental function of nœsis, which is bestdescribed as “enlightened intuition”. 105Authentic nœsis invalidates the notion that “anyreligion is as true as any other religion”. While thathas become a rationalization of conventionalreligious toleration, it is one of convenience andsloppiness, not of integrity.The OU is characterized not by an unrelatedjumble of random/incompatible NL, but rather by asmooth synthesis of it. So component names maychange across languages and ethnicities, but theintegral harmony of NL itself is OU-invariable.What this means is that the OU-religion we shallidentify, then examine in detail in these lectures isnecessarily, inevitably exclusive. If it is accurateand perfect, all others must be inaccurate and false.There is no “either/or” evasion or rationalizationhere.Hence humans who adopt it will no longer beable to avail themselves of the convenience ofalternatives-equality. If they wish to tolerate otherreligions out of courtesy and to avoid antagonism,such a decision must be for those acknowledgedrationales, whether or not openly admitted.105 For a detailed discussion and illustration of the Platonic“Pyramid of Thought”, see my book FindFar. Collectively thePlatonic Dialogues demonstrate that (a) reliable nœsisprerequires sound dianoia dialectic, and (b) dianoia itself, nomatter how rigorous, is incapable of apprehending the Forms:Dianoia is deductive and inductive, but not intuitive.- 141 -C. Conventional Religion Instillation1. Childhood IndoctrinationConventional religions are indoctrinated intohumans as children, before they feel or understandany need for them.This preempts the requirement for convincingthe indoctrinatee of the validity of such teaching. Aspart of this process, children are not exposed toalternative religions, or to non-religion [except inatheistic or agnostic families], as equal options; theyare either not mentioned at all or identified asforbidden falsehoods.Individuals who were not subjected to childhoodindoctrination, or who discard it later in maturity,may be “credentially” free of it, but are nonethelesssocialized in a community climate based upon itstacit norms. Thus the United States may formallyproclaim that it is a secular society, whilenevertheless regarding Judæo-Christian values as“correct” vs., say, those of Buddhism or Islam -equally tacitly relegated to quaint eccentricities.An extremely important characteristic of bothRHP and LHP initiation is that it cannot be instilledin children as conventional religion is, for the simplereason that initiation requires active reasoning, notmere passive, uncomprehending recitation.2. Adult ConversionAdults not childhood-indoctrinated into aconventional religion may be enticed or enforcedinto one by social pressures (community acceptance,marriage, professional advantage).- 142 -Unlike children, who have been raised in theprotective assurances of their indoctrinated faith,unaffiliated adults have matured to the point wherethey are fully susceptible to fear of the unknown asregards their own role and morality. Accordinglythey may convert as much out of this fear as forconvenience. This frequently results in such adultsbeing much more fanatic and desperate in theiradopted refuge than their fellows for whom it was anunremarkable absolute of their adolescence.3. Disintoxicationa. No Tar BabyPersons raised in non-religious environments, orwho are not easily susceptible to later conversionenticement or intimidation, are in the pleasantposition of being able to consider or ignore religious,philosophical, or ideological options with leisurelydiscretion. It is to audiences with this absolutefreedom from preconditioned bias and ulteriormotivation that these lectures will be mostintelligible.But what of those who are still stuck to old tarbabies, either consciously or unconsciously-habitually? 106Optimally they will de-tar themselves by nothingmore exotic or dramatic than collegial conversationand personal meditation. But for those individualsso enmired in old superstitions, threats, and dooms106 In Joel Chandler Harris’ classic Uncle Remus stories, laterfilmed by Walt Disney as Song of the South, Br’er Fox andBr’er Bear finally catch the wily Br’er Rabbit by luring him intostriking an unresponsive figure made of tar, to which he is thenstuck fast.- 143 -as to terrorize them into inaction, Huysmans107 andOrwell offer an effective, if dramatic solution:b. Black Mass in Room 101Within Western cultures, in which Judæo-Christianity remains the prevalent religiouspreconditioning, resistance to and rejection of thesechains occasionally requires the formality andintensity of a disintoxication ritual: the Black Mass.The purpose of any Black Mass is to purgeparticipants or onlookers of any preconditionedsuperstitions to which their enslavement is beyondreasoned discourse, as a consequence of oldsuperstitions or indoctrinations. Once one has seenhis sacred cows trampled upon with impunity, hewill never again feel the same fear of them, nomatter how pro forma he recognizes the desecrationto have been:The liberation of the human mind has never beenfurthered by dunderheads; it has been furthered by gayfellows who heaved dead cats into sanctuaries andthen went roistering down the highways of the world,proving to all men that doubt, after all, was safe - thatthe god in the sanctuary was finite in his power andhence a fraud. One horselaugh is worth ten thousandsyllogisms. It is not only more effective; it is also vastlymore intelligent. 108107 La-Bas ( Down There) by J.K. Huysmans (NY: Dover, 1972).The classic of late 19th-Century French Satanism, containingdetailed accounts of the 17th-Century Black Mass as laterpracticed in “underground” Paris. The book evidences a strongChristian moral bias; hence it is historically unreliable.Nevertheless it became a model for subsequent efforts at anti-Christian ceremonies.108 Mencken, H.L., “The Iconoclast” in Prejudices: FourthSeries. New York: Knopf, 1924, pages #139-40.- 144 -Rather more chillingly George Orwell illustratesa secular version of the Black Mass in 1984, whereinthe magician O’Brien forces his subject WinstonSmith to “trample upon the sacred cow” of his lovefor Julia. Although Winston recognizes thatunendurable psychological terror was used on him,he nonetheless finds himself unable to recapture hisoriginal illusion of self-sacrificial love for her.Julia, put through a similar “Black Mass”incorporating differently-personalized elements ofemotional impasse, experiences the same disruptionof her illusions:“Sometimes,” she said [to Winston], “they threatenyou with something - something you can’t stand up to,can’t even think about. And then you say, ‘Don’t do itto me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so.’ Andperhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it wasonly a trick and that you just said it to make them stopand didn’t really mean it. But that isn’t true. At thetime when it happens, you do mean it. You thinkthere’s no other way of saving yourself, and you’requite ready to save yourself that way. You want it tohappen to the other person. You don’t give a damnwhat they suffer. All you care about is yourself.”“All you care about is yourself,” he echoed.“And after that you don’t feel the same toward theother person any longer.”“No,” he said, “you don’t feel the same.” 109In 1984 every “Room 101” ritual was tailored toeach subject’s personal, unique “sacred cow”.Similarly each religious Black Mass is configuredto dispel the most crippling terrors of theindoctrinated faith. Hence a Black Mass for aMormon would be quite different from that for aMuslim or Buddhist.109 Orwell, George, 1984.

Behind the CurtainWhat is it that impels, or compels humans towonder about, enquire of, and venture into the“why” of not just existence generally, but their ownspecifically?- 148 -No other form of life on Earth either cares orbothers, and seems non the worse - and arguably thebetter - for it.1. Physics & MetaphysicsSetting out on the adventure of life, individualssoon classify it as a mixture of pain and pleasure,some of which can be sourced, predicted, andcontrolled.Yet beyond even the most well-ordered lifestyle,there lurk the unforeseen and uncontrollable -sometimes beneficial, more often harmful. The moresuch incidents can be explained, obviously the betterthe former can be cultivated, the latter minimized.Within the variables of the OU, science ever-increasingly explains the “how”, but never the“why”. And beyond the OU-limits of scientificresearch, even greater “whys” can be advanced.As [OU] physical questions invite physicalanswers, so SU metaphysical questions can only beaddressed by metaphysical inquiry.Such resolutions fall into the two generalcategories of [active] philosophy (Platonic dianoia)and [passive] apprehension (Platonic nœsis).The genius of Plato’s famous Dialogues was tocombine the two devices into a progressive sequenceof interrogation into metaphysical Truth ( Agathon):the dialectic. Hence every Dialogue first employsdianoia to strip away vagueness and irrelevancyfrom the concept in question, and only then toinvoke its perfect apprehension as a primal Form(Egyptian neter) through nœsis.The mechanism by which dianoia functions isthe physiological capacity of the human mind- 149 -and brain for reason through observationand logic.But the mechanism for nœsis is not so obvious:It could be either an as-yet-unidentified inherentgenius in human consciousness, e.g. an aspect of the“soul” or MindStar110 - requiring no externalimpetus; or it could be the result of inspiration fromthe higher Form/ neter itself: in bald vernacular“revelation from a god”.Whether dianoic or nœtic, truths are practicallyvalidated by observation and application. This iseasier, quicker, and more conclusive in the OU,wherein the tools of logical integration with existingknowledge can be applied.In the case of metaphysics, however, each Truthmust necessarily stand on its own, as may requireobservation, recognition, and appreciation overmany years, and even then to merely assume, notprove. Proof is a function of logic, which isapplicable only within the OU.Within the adventure of initiation, the search forthe Agathon in its many representations neitherdesires nor requires any external motivation oraugmentation; it is for each initiate a pure, ecstatic“Grail Quest”.2. The GrailThe power and symbolism of the Grail extendsfar beyond, and historically in greater antiquity,than in Arthurian legend. In the words of Dr. FranzWinkler:110 The author’s book MindStar proposes this term to moreaccurately encompass the Egyptians’ eightfold emanations ofsentient identity, which later cultures would coarsely imagineas a single “soul”.- 150 -When we think of the origin of man, we insistillogically on confusing the history of his purelybiological being with the history of his spirit; the latterdefies any attempt at investigation by methods we nowcall scientific. Darwin and his followers deal with theemergent evolution of visible man, while on the otherhand religion and mythology deal with the evolution ofhis invisible soul. In his cycle of the Ring and Parsifal,Wagner uses the magic power of music, words, andscenery to open man’s heart to the history of thehidden essence of his own self, and to the changingforces that are active behind the sensory phenomena ofman and Earth. 111And further, between others:Well aware of Himmler’s fascination with ancientGermanic paganism, and antipathy for anythingChristian, Hitler looked at him quizzically; he saw thatthe Reichsführer had anticipated his question.“I don’t think that either of us holds to thesuperficial interpretation of Parsifal. That is just therefor audiences incapable of sensing its deepersymbolism, and numbed by generations of Christianindoctrination.“It was Wagner’s music itself that first opened myeyes, or in this case my ears. The vistas it unfolds areanything but Christian; they reach to the majesty of thesoul itself. The music not only thrills one’s innerconsciousness; it orders, indeed dictates the operaticsets to visually complement its sonic revelation.“That is what I seek to do here, but without eventhe pretense of fantasy or entertainment thatconstricted Wagner - and which he loathed, causinghim to insulate at least this, his final and greatestsingle opera, against it by forbidding its performanceexcept at Bayreuth. Here at the Wewelsburg it will allbe real, not imaginary.”Himmler was clearly transfixed by the passion andintensity of his confession. He was, Hitler realized,utterly oblivious to the world they had just left, as111 Winkler, Franz E., For Freedom Destined: Mysteries ofMan’s Evolution in the Mythology of Wagner’s Ring Operasand Parsifal (Garden City, NY: Waldorf Press, 1974).- 151 -though the door to the Tower were rather a gateway toa higher, more potent reality. His statement, Hitlerperceived, had been as much an incantation to himselfas a response to his guest.“You are most prescient, Heinrich. Music andarchitecture - Is it not in these disciplines that we findrecorded the path of humanity’s ascent? When I hearWagner, it seems to me that I hear rhythms of abygone world. I imagine to myself that one day sciencewill discover, in the waves set in motion by theRheingold, secret mutual relations connected with theorder of the world. The observation of the worldperceived by the senses precedes the knowledge givenby exact science as well as by philosophy. It is insofaras percipient awareness approaches truth that it hasvalue.” 112For those not Questing the Grail, however, thereare three emotional stimulants driving him beyondanimalistic complacency: curiosity, fear, andallure. We may instructively examine each in turn:B. CuriosityCuriosity is characterized by a paradoxicalabsence of necessity: exploration or investigationfrom mere restlessness within the known andfamiliar. Its satisfaction need not promise rewardsnor relieve wants; its impetus is emotional, notmaterial. Thus it is not justified by its practicality,but by the sheer “romance of risk”.Unsurprisingly curiosity is both addictive andaccumulative: Resolving one mystery only presentsfurther, more complex ones, ad infinitum.Obviously most banal ventures into the unknownare driven by one or both of the latter rationales:112 Himmler, Heinrich & Hitler, Adolf, Schloss Wewelsburg,August 1, 1940, in We Break the Sword by Michael A. Aquino(San Francisco: Barony of Rachane, 2016, pages #64-5..- 152 -fear and/or allure. It is only the affluent, privileged,and sybaritic who can afford to indulge curiosity forits own sake. Predictably such dilettantes rarelybother with religion except as a means of controllingother humans through the latter two influences.May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity whichled us both to so monstrous a fate! Wearied with thecommonplaces of a prosaic world, where even the joysof romance and adventure soon grow stale, St. Johnand I had followed enthusiastically every æsthetic andintellectual movement which promised respite fromour devastating ennui. The enigmas of the Symbolistsand the ecstasies of the pre-Raphaelites all were oursin their time, but each new mood was drained too soonof its diverting novelty and appeal. Only the sombrephilosophy of the Decadents could hold us, and this wefound potent only by increasing gradually the depthand diabolism of our penetrations. Baudelaire andHuysmans were soon exhausted of thrills, till finallythere remained for us only the more direct stimuli ofunnatural personal experiences and adventures. 113C. Fear1. Now ...Primitive humans lived in constant privation anddanger, and in ignorance were susceptible toexplanations of oppressive, punishing supernaturaldeities. The more powerful and harmful the god, themore necessary to abase oneself before and blindlyobey it.In the Western cradle of humanity, northeastAfrica and the Middle East, the El of the Hebrewsemerged as the most vicious, jealous, punitive, andvengeful among its predecessors and competitors,113 Lovecraft, H.P., The Hound.- 153 -and thus the one with the most fearful, obsequioushuman slaves.The Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, and Romans allenjoyed a cooperative, relaxed optionality with theirgods, and so could involve or ignore them as seemedappropriate. Ironically such humans had only toworry about such gods when the latter forgotthemselves and indulged in human emotions,occasionally involving sometimes fortunate, moreoften unfortunate human bystanders. So prevalentwas such Olympian opera in Greece that a fairamount of tragicomic theater was devoted to it.2. ... and ThenThe greatest of all mysteryfears is the proverbialBig Black Sack.One of the oddities distinguishing the parentJudaism from its later Christianity and Islamprogeny is the addition of afterlife reward/punishment to the latter.While the Egyptian concept of an afterlife( Amenti) was pleasant, Mesopotamians - includingthe Canaanites and their Hebraic offshoot -considered the underworld ( Kur-nu-gi-a or Sheol)as a dim, dismal place. Hence their approach to lifewas fatalistic and pessimistic, with ethics consideredin terms of Earthly consequences only. CommentsArthur Schopenhauer in Parega #I, 13:The Jewish religion proper, as described andtaught in “Genesis” and all the historic books until theend of “Chronicles”, is the crudest of all religionsbecause it is the only one which has no theory ofimmortality - not even a trace of it. Every king andevery hero or prophet is buried, when he dies, with hisfathers, and there is an end of the matter; no trace of- 154 -any existence after death; indeed, as if intentionally,every thought of this sort seems to have been removed.Schopenhauer is only partially correct. Theancient Hebrews drew no distinction betweenhuman souls and the animating force common to allanimals ( nephesh). Although some part of thisanimating force was thought to survive thedestruction of the body, it was regarded withsuperstitious terror and referred to ambiguously bythe term rephaim (“shades” or “ghosts”: theinhabitants of Sheol). 114By the 2nd Century BCE Hebrew doctrine hadchanged to include the revivification of the materialbody, but Hebrew theologians never extended thisprinciple to the Pythagorean/Platonic concept of anindependently-surviving psyche (= MindStar).Unsurprisingly the original Christians continuedthis Jewish tradition of corporeal revivification,ignorantly and inaccurately using the Greek termpsyche to mean much the same thing as the Hebrewnephesh.In Matthew 10:28, where the soul is mentionedas distinct from the body, their posthumous reunionis promptly suggested. The most conclusive exampleof this doctrine, of course, is that of Jesus’ ownmaterial resurrection [as in Luke 24:36-43], but bythe time of Paul the distaste with whichsophisticated Greeks regarded this “animation ofcorpses” ( anastasis nekron) induced that apostle to114 Curiously the term rephraim in the Tanakh also refers tothe original inhabitants of Canaan, whom El commanded theHebrews to exterminate upon declaring Canaan their“Promised Land”. Cf. Deuteronomy 2:34, 3:6, 20:16-18. Theanalogy to modern Israel’s regard for the Palestinians isnoteworthy.- 155 -modify Christian teachings in the direction ofPythagoreanism.Paul was further aware of - and presumablysought to overcome - the challenge of Gnostic andHermetic Christianity, being a blend of basicChristianity with various Egyptian and Hellenicmysteries.The 1945 discovery of thirteen original Gnosticcodices at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt has shedmuch light on the ideas with which Paul had tocompete. The codices themselves date to 350-400CE but are probably copies of 2nd Century CEoriginals.In I Corinthians 15:35 and II Corinthians 5:1-2Paul offers a mixture of Pythagorean and Hebrewideas, whereby the posthumous soul is given a“spiritual body” ( soma pneumatikon) whichnevertheless requires a bodily form.Despite Paul’s efforts Christianity has neversucceeded in breaking free from the notion ofreanimation of the original corpse, which at leasthas been grist for the mill of horror-film producers.This linkage of the soul to the corpse is one of thekey distinctions between the Abrahamic religionsand the Eastern ones of Buddhism and Hinduism:particularly the latter in which the soul immediatelyreincarnates in a newborn human, hence customarycremation rather than storage of the corpse.The record of history establishes that fear andforce have been the principal means of bothchildhood indoctrination and adult conversion toJudaism, Christianity, and Islam.In nations and communities dominated by anyone of these, adherents to disfavored alternativereligions, as well as atheists and agnostics, areexpelled or exterminated. Only within a fairly recent- 156 -time-period, and in a narrow band of European andNorth American states, is there a veneer oftoleration: the legacy of the religion-revulsion in thepost-Thirty Years’ War Enlightenment. 115After 1550 tensions between Catholics andProtestants had reached the stage of religiouswarfare, culminating in the terrible Thirty Years'War between Denmark, Sweden, and the ProtestantGerman principalities on one hand and the CatholicHapsburgs (Spain, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, andmost of Catholic Germany) on the other. France,though Catholic, fought against the Hapsburgs forsecular political reasons. Approximately one-third ofGermany's population died from the war and itsside-effects, and the final Peace of Westphalia(1648) was brought about more by exhaustion thanby genuine reconciliation.What such “conflicts of intolerance” indicate isthat the pre/posthumous threats and enticements,as extreme as they may be, still cannot endurealternative competition. Its mere presence suggeststhe possibility that the preferred religion might notbe completely correct, which goes beyond excusableerror to heresy and blasphemy.What this attitude actually signals is theunspoken, unacknowledged fear within each suchconventional religion that at it core it is indeedinadequate: either naïve ignorance or deliberate lie.The churches, comments John Fowles:115 As specifically discussed here, the European“Enlightenment” (late 17th-18th Centuries) was an intellectualrevolt against the church-proclaimed metaethics ofChristianity in favor of purely-utilitarian reason: ethicalrelativism. However such judgments were still reserved tosovereigns; thus murder is acceptable, even admirable ifprescribed by a state, but proscribed & punishable in theindividual.- 157 -... have set themselves up as refuges and too oftentaken good care that outside their doors refuge shall beneeded. Things are better now, but we have notforgotten that they were not better until historypresented the churches with a clear choice: reform ordie. 116Actual Truth is serene in its perfection: It needsneither fear nor force to establish it, and is contentto await human discovery and appreciation.D. Allure1. Now ...In the case of Judaism/Christianity/Islam,individual conscious existence is the object of eitherreward or punishment by El. As above, with Jewssuch consequences are prehumous, with Christianityand Islam posthumous.Common to all is human helplessness to redeemoneself from Adam’s sin (ironically, his - and their -acquisition of the divine prerogatives of separateexistence, consciousness, and will).In Judaism submission and obedience to El arean inescapable permanence, and even to questionthis, much less expect any favor from it, isblasphemous. In Job 40:8-14 El contemptuouslyreproves Job for daring to validate his ownrighteousness, implying that he can know and thuslimit El’s motives and expressions:Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thoucondemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?Hast thou an arm like El? or canst thou thunderwith a voice like him?116 Fowles, John, The Aristos. New York: Signet Books, 1964,page #106.- 158 -Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; andarray thyself with glory and beauty.Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and beholdevery one that is proud, and abase him.Look on every one that is proud, and bring himlow; and tread down the wicked in their place.Hide them in the dust together; and bind theirfaces in secret.Then will I also confess unto thee that thine ownright hand can save thee.Christians and Muslims are equally helpless bythemselves; they are more fortunate than Jews to begranted a divine redeemer in the person of Jesus orMohammed: all they need do is accept this “Grace”:For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of El,and are justified by his grace as a gift, through theredemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom El putforward as a propitiation by his blood, to be receivedby faith. This was to show El’s righteousness, becausein his divine forbearance he had passed over formersins.117To be redeemed in Islam, it is only necessary tospend a lifetime as a diligent, dutiful Muslim. To besure, Islam doesn’t consider Judaism or Christianityacceptable alternatives:Fight those who believe not in El (=“Allah”) northe Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath beenforbidden by El and his Messenger [Mohammed], noracknowledge the religion of truth [Islam] from amongthe people of the Book [Jews and Christians] until theypay the jizya (poll tax levied from non-Muslims) withwilling submission and feel themselves subdued. 118The punishment of those who wage war against Eland his Messenger is execution, or crucifixion, or117 Holy Bible, Romans 3:23-5.118 Holy Koran (King Fahd), Surat Al-Tauba 9:29.- 159 -cutting off hands and feet from opposite sides, or exilefrom the land. 119In all cases there is no question of redemption,favor, or reward in prehumous life. In Judaism El iscompletely unintelligible, such that the Hebrewmight with equal divine righteousness be enslavedin Egypt one day and exodused the next.Things are more complicated in the other two:The final, inevitable reward/punishment isposthumous, but prehumous acceptance of Gracerequires one to acknowledge and submit to Jesus orMohammed while still incarnate. Respectiveinstitutions and clergy exist to define and grade suchbehavior, whose most common characteristic isabstinence from various indulgences of free will.Whether the social effects of such self-denial arebeneficial or harmful is explicitly a secondaryconsideration. 120So where “this life” is concerned, the Abrahamicreligions offer nothing in exchange for theirdemanded commitment, unless one happens to be amasochist. They are in effect “death cults”, in whichall of human life, experience, and behavior isassessed and governed according to posthumousjudgment and consequences. It is thus no greatsurprise that humans’ prehouse, concious life shouldbe faulted and condemned as the original, hencegreatest “sin”.119 Ibid., Surat Al-Maidah 5:33.120 O’Brien: “How does one man assert his power over another,Winston?”“By making him suffer.”“Exactly. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure he isobeying your will and not his own?”- George Orwell, 1984- 160 -2. ... and ThenJews being doomed to Sheol ic oblivion upondeath, what Heavenly delights await their GracefulChristian and Muslim counterparts?It’s pretty vague:The Catholic Catechism 1024 describes Heavenas “... the ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepesthuman longings, the state of supreme, definitivehappiness”.There is no consensus among Protestants, save ageneral interest in “bodily resurrection” andemphasis on admittance at the “End Times” asdepicted in the Holy Bible Revelations.The Muslim afterlife-paradise, Jannah, isdescribed as a hedonistic environment of “beautifulmaidens, precious jewels, delicious food, andflowing water”. El gains the additional title “theMerciful” since both good and naughty humans areadmitted; the latter have only to be celestiallyspanked a bit before being allocated maidens, etc.Presumably female Muslims make the acquaintanceof Valentino-smoldering sheiks.The most famous effort to go beyond platitudesof “love” and “light” to a detailed description ofHeaven is the third (“Paradiso”) chapter of DanteAlighieri’s Divine Comedy (1308-20). Therein, in atour conducted by his muse Beatrice, Heaven isdivided into nine “spheres” of correspondingly-admirable virtues, above and beyond which is the“Empyrean” (abode of El).Other than singling out various virtues forspherical habitation, however, Dante offers no clueas to their constitution or how they might enjoythemselves.- 161 -The paradoxicality of Paradise is that, as at leasthinted in the Islamic version, humanity’s most-desired pleasures turn out to be much the same asthe indulgences piously proscribed during incarnateexistence. Lapsing into descriptive fuzziness about“light” and “love” enables theologians to escapeHeavens that resemble Playboy Clubs or the LasVegas Strip. 121In all seriousness, and on the assumption that ifthe various conventional religions agree on nothingelse, they are unanimous that corporeal demisedoes not mean the Big Black Sack of nothingness, agreat deal of attention would be devoted not only tothe alternative destinations on the Other Side, butalso very methodically to the consequences of one’sactions on This Side - obviously the much brieferperiod. Surprisingly this is not at all the case. Theostensible reason for this is that, in each of them,the entire concept and scope of human existence isnot addressed as a single complexity.Later these lectures propose to do just that.121 On the 1966-75 Church of Satan’s business cards High PriestAnton LaVey advocated “Indulgence instead of Abstinence”:the pleasures of Heaven this side of the grave, along with BlackMagic to continue such diversion after discarding one’s corpse.Not a bad deal, actually.- 162 -[index-163_1.png]- 163 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6: THIRD LECTUREOPTIONSI have the simplest tastes; I am alwayssatisfied with the best.- Oscar WildeBetween two evils, I always pick the one Inever tried before.- Mae WestPh'nglui mglw'nafh Dagon Az’tlan wgah'naglfhtagn.A. Choice1. FreedomThere is a plethora of religions out there, fromthe simple to the incomprehensible, the primordialto the extemporaneous, the comforting to theterrifying. Theoretically each surface human is freeto chose the most credible, practical, and satisfying.But in actuality this is rarely the case. As coveredin the previous lecture, there are family, community,national, ethnic, and other cultural pressures- 164 -constraining if not preempting preference. Deviancefrom such expectation can result in criticism,punishment, ostracism, or even execution. As thegreat majority of humans are “born into” theestablished religion, bona fide choice does not ariseuntil family-independent adulthood, beyond whichthere are still the larger-group pressures with whichto contend. What this means in practice is that mostpeople just passively surrender to the religion ofbirth, at most being merely nominal in their belief inand exercise of it. Such casual cosmopolitanism ismore prevalent in the post-Enlightenment, modernWest than in the more traditional and primitivestates of the Third World.As conventional religions are transparently aswell as tacitly nonsensical, nominalists see noreason to worry overmuch about their insincerity. Ifthey further assume that the absurdity of their birth-religion is merely echoed in different metaphors byall the others, they just as consequently feel no needto go shopping for a better one, especially if thiswould have disruptive repercussions within theiraccustomed family and community circles.This narrows the premise of “freedom of choice”to the few who feel themselves reasonably safe fromretaliation, and who also decide that such a searchand choice are worth the bother at all.For humans who happen to survive both thesediscouragements, this lecture is intended tosystematize the search.Initially there are three choice-mechanisms:passive, active, and innovative. The first two ofthese are limited to what’s already out there; thethird involves a fresh construction which mayrecombine existing elements with or withoutnovelty.- 165 -As the audience may expect from the variousdissatisfactions previously identified, this series willwind up spending most of its resolving efforts on thethird option.2. PassiveIn a passive choice you first limit yourself to thearray of existing religions, and then accept the onewhich impresses you with the most persuasive andconvincing argument.The unspoken assumption of the first filtration isthat if these religions have survived for a sufficientlylong period of time and attracted many believers,some or all of them must be valid. In actuality bothof these premises are false.The second filtration has nothing to do with thequestion of a religion’s validity, but only with howsuccessful it is in frightening and/or enticing you[per the previous lecture].While both of these filtrations are useful inrecruiting, they are functions of merchandising andadvertising effectiveness, not disinterested searchfor truth.Hence it is unsurprising that passive acceptanceof a prepackaged religion implies that the prospecthuman is not invited to question or criticize it;acceptance and admission imply that the novice isexpected to believe and obey by faith and trustalone. The reciprocity of this arrangement isfreedom from the burden of doubt, indeed of havingto think about the religion’s premises or substanceat all. For many, indeed most humans, this is notonerous; it is a relief from having to confrontintimidating questions.- 166 -Indeed there is a tacit, if not explicit quid proquo methodology at work here: It is in the firststages of the presentation of a new ideology that itsfaults and failures will be most conspicuous. If anewcomer can be convinced to tolerate these uponarrival, they will become more rationalized later.3. Activea. EducationActive filtration of choice is essentially a moreself-centered approach to the existing array. Herethe deciding criterion is only secondarily howeffectively the options market themselves. Theprincipal determinant is rather which one mostsatisfies the individual, which may range from thematerial to the fantastic of pleasures, and from theemotional to the intellectual, both pre- andposthumously.This is the realm of the seminary student, thereligious scholar: expected to articulate the chosenreligion, and to know enough about its competitorsto reject them. As with the passive adherent,however, the activist is, in finality, still limited byfaith and trust - where the greatest, ultimatequestions are concentrated. These are premised, andin the scholar’s case demanded to be beyond humanability to comprehend, even for descendants of Jobimpudent to ask them. In a curious context of anti-intellectualism, “faith-blindness” is accordedrespect, not denigration.In academia the exercise of reasoning andargument towards a predetermined conclusion istermed scholasticism to distinguish it from- 167 -authentic, open-ended scholarship. 122 Thescholasticist is not seeking to discover an unknowntruth; he assumes it as his point of conclusion. Histask is to substantiate it: to argumentatively buttressit as convincingly as possible, at least to his ownsatisfaction, but sometimes to others’ as well. 123It could be contended that both active andpassive choices are but flip-sides of the same coin,since the selling religions all market themselves toappeal to prospects, while those prospects evaluatetheir expected pleasure on the basis of what ispromised. It is just a question of the amount ofpersonal intellectual effort expended. The individualin either case clings to his commitment on the basisof faith in it, not rational argument.b. InitiationEducation [in this context] amounts to learning& memorizing a body of information, sufficient torecite and discuss it. The extent to which youactually understand it varies, but is not essential.122 Here note must be taken that, including in the hard as wellas the social sciences, there are a great many “acceptedprinciples” which the student questions at his peril -particularly if he expects welcome into the teaching, research,and publishing establishments of the discipline in question. Aswith theology, even to accuse a “sacred cow” of being one isdangerous.123 The most famous treatise of scholasticism is ThomasAquinas’ 1274 Summa Theologica, which rescued medievalChristianity from the embarrassing sophistications of thatrascally heathen Aristotle, inconveniently preserved by even-more-blasphemous Islam. A grateful Catholic Church dulycanonized Saint Tom, whose excruciatingly-torturous excusesand rationalizations remain the backbone of Catholicism tothis day.- 168 -Once again this level of involvement suffices formost humans: If asked about their religion, they cansummarize it without sounding ignorant.Going beyond recitation into comprehension andunderstanding of a religion constitutes initiation.(1) ConceptIn conventional parlance “initiation” consists ofinduction into the membership of a secret society,hence being entitled to successively more exclusivesecrets as the level of membership rises.In practice most “initiatory” societies, even ifnaïvely sincere, have nothing to impart exceptflowery but empty platitudes. Such “initiates” dwellin a lotus-land of pageantry and pretension alone,leaving them naught but a lighter wallet to show fortheir involvement.Authentic initiation enhances individualwisdom, not collective chorus. It is best describedas an acquired skill for the distinction of truth fromfalsehood, substance from illusion. In this it is muchlike the original concept of university education,which trains and exercises the student in principlesand measures of discernment in research, regardlessof the field of specialty. Thus true initiation can besaid to constitute a “university of the esoteric” tocomplement exoteric academia.Within the context of this discussion, “initiation”denotes an active, personal adventure into thecomplexities and questions of metaphysics. Suchadventure can involve either or both of twomethodologies, or “Paths”:- 169 -(2)The Two PathsThe terms Left-Hand Path (LHP) and Right-Hand Path (RHP) refer respectively to the goals ofrecognizing and emphasizing one’s individualseparateness from the OU, or rejecting thatseparateness in favor of [re]union with the OU. 124 Toput it another way, the LHP seeks individualdivinity, while the RHP seeks [re]absorption inexisting OU divinity.The paradox of the RHP is that it prescribesincreasingly stronger individual coherence andeffort to successfully meld with the OU; it is thissame personal coherence that strengthens andemphasizes separate individuality. The closer theRHP initiate comes to comprehending the essence ofthe OU and thus enabling immersion or dissolutionwithin it, the stronger the definition and assertion ofhis distinction from it.In short, the only way the RHP initiate canqualify to merge with El without corruption is tobecome a complete mirror-consciousness ofEl, at which stage melding or absorption isseamless. But ironically it presents a new paradox:Is the “new” El the original or the copy - and, afterall, does it even matter?124 Historically the terms LHP & RHP originated in Tantrism, aschool of Vajrayana Buddhism in northern India which taughtthat Buddhahood can be realized through various theurgicpractices. For mantra and mudra ceremonies the female waspositioned to the right of the male; for erotic rites she waspositioned to the left. Theosophy’s H.P. Blavatsky felt sex-magic to be immoral and perverse, so she subsequentlyemployed the term “LHP” to characterize the magical systemsshe didn’t like, and the term “RHP” the ones she did, i.e.Theosophy. As used herein the two terms have no moralconnotation.- 170 -The LHP is often accused of arrogance, ofrebellion. But the LHP initiate does not seek toreplace or eliminate the OU/El, while that isultimately what the RHP initiate aspires to do: soperfectly that the synthesis will be not justindetectable but indistinguishable.It is this paradox which IlluminAnX proposes toresolve. But first it is necessary to identify andaddress the remaining alternatives.(3) Thinking ProcessesKnowledge of the [physical] OU is acquiredthrough two vehicles: the scientific method ofreplicated experimentation, and logic (thecombination of known or assumed facts by reasoneddeductive or inductive inference.Nevertheless Immanuel Kant and Georg Hegelcautioned against rushing to logical conclusionsfrom crude, convenient superficialities, holding thattrue logic is transcendental, which humans canapproach only intuitionally ( nœsis). Kant wasparticularly wary of the ancient Greek dialectic, as adevice to imply valid conclusions from pre-selectedunproven premises. 1254. InnovativeInnovation is th recourse when one rejects theexisting array of religions, yet still feels the need forone which will satisfy the curiosity, fear, and/orallure which they purport to answer in theiradvertisements. Just because one scorns Jewish or125 A similar criticism applies to Aristotlle’s famous “GoldenMean” [of solution through compromise], which is easy topredetermine by moving the chosen extremes.- 171 -Christian death/afterlife myths, for instance, doesn’tremove concern about death itself.So the third option is to construct a new,customized religion, either as a mix of variouspreexisting ones or as something completely novel.To be of any value, of course, such an innovationcannot be intentionally fictitious. The creator mustpersonally believe in it, on the premise that it doesin fact represent truth to the best of his measure ofit.The risk of innovation is precisely that it isindividually conceived, and thus has not withstoodthe test of others’ experience and opinion of it. Justas the old institutional religions claim validity on thegrounds of their survival for many centuries andthrough thousands or millions of believers, so theinnovator must acknowledge and accept that he hasneither of these reassurances, despite their bothbeing inherently vacuous. There is the psychology of“safety in numbers”, and the argument that an ideawhich has survived many examinations over time isless precarious than one which has not.Such limitations of innovation may becompletely acceptable to individuals of strongconfidence in their own education, integrity, andthinking ability. Whether their innovation is sharedby others may be of interest to them, but also ofunconcern. Ultimately no matter how generalized aphilosophy or religion may be framed, it is still goingto be subject to as many interpretations - SUs - asthere are individuals attempting to comprehend andactualize it.Hence any proposed innovative religion mustrecognize that it can never be more than aframework, and certainly not an ideology whicheveryone will or even can assimilate identically. The- 172 -mature theorist must grasp this a priori, and notfeel either insulted or threatened if the flag he hasjust run up the flagpole is saluted in a multitude ofdifferent ways [or, if uninteresting or unconvincing,ignored].As developed previously, conventional religionsoriginated as a clumsily, ignorantly desperateattempt to explain the mysteries surroundinghuman existence, consciousness, and their apparentinconsistency with and alienation from everythingelse.The conspicuous and sole exception to this“gradual construction from ignorance andobservation is the religion of ancient Egypt, whichappeared predynastically as a complete cosmology,remaining thus for the next 3,000(+) years. 126Over the millennia science has identified many ofthe regularities (NL) characteristic of the OU. But anall-encompassing “unified field theory” of NL seemsmaddeningly elusive the more detail is discovered -or so it has long seemed per the Einsteinian“gravitational model” of the universe.Recently an alternative cosmology based on theElectromagnetic Spectrum rather than the still-unknown mechanism of gravity has appeared: the“Electrical Universe” theory. 127But beyond all such NL-discovery the central,primal mystery remains: Why? Why is physical126 Cf. Lockyer and Massey, op.cit. In Egyptology one oftenhears the quip that, unlike all other civilizations, Egypt seemsto have “started at the top and run down for thirty centuries”.127 While a discussion of the “Electrical Universe” theory isperipheral to this book, its implications arguably resolve manyof the GU impossibilities. Cf.https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/- 173 -existence as it is? Why is the NL governing itomnipresent, inviolable, and immutable?And following from this, as well as even moreunnerving: How is it that intelligent humanity canrecognize and distinguish such NL, whichnecessitates an intellectual and sensory perspectiveapart from it?It is scarcely surprising that humanity’sawareness of its “outsideness” is unnerving, evenfrightening. The embrace of the OU and its NLconstitution is overwhelming, extending indeed tothe “microcosmic” mechanism and structure of thehuman body itself. The notion of anything existingwhich is not included in this envelope suggests aflaw, an accident, which requires either correction orelimination accordingly. Then and only than can theOU-whole be completely, perfectly uniformal.We shall now survey the various ways thathumanity has attempted to define, confront, andresolve this “imperfection”.B. AbsorptionThe simplest and seemingly self-evident solutionfor an “imperfection” is the correction of its fault ordefect, enabling and causing its absorption into the“perfect whole”.Since that “perfect whole” is postulated to beperfect, the fault must necessarily be a later accidentor aberration.And since it is identifiable as the human intellect,it is that intellect which must be condemned,punished, neutralized, annihilated. There are twogeneral vehicles for this:- 174 -1. Passive: Slave-ReligionsPassive absorption religions are by far the mostprevalent and enduring responses historically andcontemporarily, for the simple reason that they arepalliatives and sedatives designed to minimizehuman intellectual confrontation or concern, andindeed to repress, punish, and/or exterminate suchconcern should individuals display or attempt it.Their common goal is to enslave humanconsciousness from birth to death, ideally neverallowing it to manifest during one’s lifetime.The principal slave-religions worldwide are the“Abrahamic” ones of Judaism and its derivativesChristianity and Islam. All three are built on astructure of myth in which belief on blind “faith”alone is required. Inconvenient contradictions andinvalidations from individual observation orexperience are to be ignored, suppressed, or ifnecessary punished. The overriding principle isunquestioning obedience.In the parent slave-religion, Judaism, there is noreward for such obedience - only punishment fordefiance.The premise of all three slave-religions is thatobedience in conscious-incarnate life will precludeor minimize both prehumous and posthumouspunishment, permitting and hopefully hasteningreabsorption.As discussed previously, such reabsorptionpromises only dulled near-coma for Jews, but activeHeaven-pleasure or Hell-pain for Christians andMuslims.Historically the more unintelligent anduneducated the population, the more prevalent andenforced the slave-religions, extending to their- 175 -unceasing local massacres, international wars, andcontinental genocidal exterminations against oneanother, as well as external heathens andunbelievers.The European Enlightenment shattered literalbelief in Christianity thereafter except among themost stupid and uneducated, revising it to apropaganda device for their docile control.Meanwhile Judaism and Islam have largelypreserved their literal-mythological grip onadherents, as most obviously apparent in state-levelwars inspired and prosecuted by them.2. Active: Right-Hand Path InitiationIf the profile and history of the passive slave-religions sound unappealing, the point of theselectures is that the ideal of harmonious alignmentto, if not absorption within the OU is indeed bothpossible and practical, through the catalyst ofauthentic RHP initiation. We shall return to thisafter first surveying the remaining alternative: thatnot of distinction from nor absorption into the OU,but simple self-annihilation.C. Obliteration1. Passive: TaoIn principle both passive and active absorptiondoes not annihilate one’s individual consciousness.In the former the obedient slave at least avoidsposthumous punishment, and may enjoy nebulouspleasures. In the latter the successful RHP initiatebecomes harmoniously aligned with the authority ofNL (the neteru). There is neither absorption nor- 176 -need for it, because there is no conflictcompromising the harmony.The remaining option - obliteration - does notpresume the posthumous continuation of humanconsciousness, either as rewarded slave or NL-harmonic. Rather it postulates that the separateconsciousness is an aberration which should becompletely annihilated. True peace can be foundonly in absence.Presumably this implies a prescription of suicide.But humans being as existence-affirming as they[un]naturally are, an endurable hypocrisy was calledfor: Tao.Tao, originated ca. the 5th-6th Centuries BCE byLao Tzu, comprises both the apprehension of thetotality and momentum of NL, and the simpleindistinction of anything else [including oneself]it. 128As it is the 5th Dimension of Imagination, ofexternal perception and perspective that establishesthe isolate consciousness beyond the 4 of the OU129,The Taoist130 therefore seeks no action whatever, buta cessation of any sensation of isolate existence orperspective: in Western philosophical parlance, aninversion of Kant’s “pure reason” (awareness ofexistence absent all externality), as confronted by128 Tao is usually translated as “the Way” [in the sense of theonflowing of the OU]. It is most closely reflected in the classicTao Te Ching, authored by Lao Tzu.129 For a discussion of the 4 OU Dimensions and the 5th SUDimension, cf. the author’s MindStar and FindFar.130 A true disciple of Tao would disdain this appllation as ahopeless vulgarity. The Tao and those aware of it areindistinguishable.- 177 -Dr. Edward Jessup at the culmination of his searchfor the “original self”:Hell, mankind has been talking about it forever,ever since the first human being noticed that life wasimpermanent. We’ve sat in caves and speculated onshadows, stood on mountains and stared stunned atthe infinite precision of the universe. We’ve seenvisions, manufactured gods, probed, prayed,calculated, measured, wondered, and dreamed.And for what? For something more permanentthan human life. For some truth that standsimmutably behind the silly, transparent superficies ofhuman pain and human vanity and human greed andhuman savagery.Well, I found the fucker! I found the final truththat all of us have been treasure-hunting for! I foundit, touched it, ate of its flesh, drank its blood.I’ve seen it face-to-face, and it is hideous! It isinsufferable! The pain cannot be described!I was in it, Emily! I was in that ultimate momentof terror that is the beginning of life!I can tell you what it is! It is nothing, simple,hideous nothing!The final truth of all things is that there is n0 finaltruth! Truth is what’s transitory. It is human life thatis real! Truth is the illusion! Life is the onlysubstance we have!I am truth; it is God that is fiction!This is real! You and me sitting here in this room!That is real! That is substance! That is the only truththere is! 131What the terrified Dr. Jessup does not realize isthat his experiments in sensory-deprivation havesucceeded in blanketing only the physical external-sensory emanation of the MindStar, e.g. the khat.The other seven emanations are unaffected, and ofcourse alive; the Tao may be a prism, but it does notkill its “colors”.131 Chayefsky, Paddy, Altered States. NY: Harper & Row, 1978,page #177.- 178 -The effect of the Tao upon the MindStar is mostelegantly summarized in the oriental vision of theGolden Flower, wherein the khat is known as thekuei:Tao the undivided, Great One, gives rise to twoopposite reality principles, Darkness and Light, yinand yang. These are at first thought of only as forces ofnature apart from man. Later the sexual polarities, andothers as well, are derived from them. From yin comesK’un, the receptive feminine principle; from yangcomes Ch’ien, the creative masculine principle. Fromyin comes ming (life); from yang comes hsing(essence).Each individual contains a central monad which,at the moment of conception, splits into life andessence ( ming and hsing). These two are super-individual principles and so can be related to eros andlogos.In the personal bodily existence of the individualthey are represented by two other polarities, a p’o soul(or anima) and a hun soul (or animus). All during thelife of the individual these two are in conflict, eachstriving for mastery. At death they separate and godifferent ways. The anima sinks to earth as kuei, aghost-being. 132Suppression of the khat through Tao disciplineblankets the senses, as Dr. Jessup experienced, andresults in what can be likened to “suspendedanimation” rather than actual death. It is he“Undead” state of the vampire, the twilight existenceof the zombie. The possibilities for “unanticipated132 The Secret of the Golden Flower by Richard Wilhelm(Trans) (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1931.

Cf. also amore recent translation by Thomas Cleary (San Francisco:HarperSan Francisco, 1991).- 179 -consequences”, as in these instances, do notcommend this as a religious option.2. Active: ExistentialismIt is fashionable among avowed Existentialists tonot define “Existentialism” on the grounds that it isinherently descriptive, not prescriptive of humanbehavior, and that, not being systematic, it variescompletely from individual to individual. Hence itcan be observed, and the term assigned, onlydescriptively after-the-fact; and no conclusionsgoverning others can be drawn from it.Thus Existentialism is not so much a philosophyas an anti-philosophy: a rejection of classicalphilosophy as too abstract and non-experience-based to be real and relevant to humanity.The Existentialist therefore does not begin withan intellectual definition of humanity generally orhimself individually. Rather he interacts withsituations and circumstances in which he findshimself, and gradually builds up a self-image basedupon his impressions and actions. This is themeaning of the Existentialist slogan that “existenceprecedes essence”.Tao begins with perception and acceptance ofindividual consciousness, followed by deliberaterejection and abandonment of it in order to reducethe individual to a completely-compliant aspect ofTao: a being governed by instinct rather thanintellect.The Existentialist has the same de facto goal, butgoes the Taoist one better by denying that he has anintellect to be destroyed in the first place. For himthe intellect is a mere illusion, an insane conceit. Heindeed insists that the metaphysical genius, the- 180 -“philosophical individual”, never really existed at all,and that “authenticity” results from realizing thisand resigning oneself to a mere stimulus/response-reactive machine.Such passionate self-denial and -destruction isnot only counter-intuitive, but emotionally-torturous. The stress reduced Existentialists likeNietzsche to incoherence, and others like Sartre tocompulsive horror (“nausea”) at the “obscenity” ofexistence generally.The successful Taoist becomes a tree, thesuccessful Existentialist a machine for instinctivesurvival and gratification alone.D. DistinctionThe previous options share an awareness of theOU, a recognition that self-conscious humanity isincongruous with if not completely alien to it, and asolution to destroy this aberration by either[re]integration or destruction. The notion of merelyallowing the separateness and tension to continue,much less increase, is not on the table; indeed ifconsidered at all it is condemned as a cosmic evil, ablasphemy.1. CarefreedomIf it is impossible to prehumously [re]devolveinto the OU, or to end one’s separately-conscioussuffering by destruction of one’s OU-connection (thephysical body), what other options are there?The prima facie, as well as most immediate andmost opportunistic answer is, upon recognizingone’s separate and conscious existence, to enjoy it,- 181 -rejecting all propaganda, all threats to accept aposture of guilt and penitence.The Hellenistic Greeks, disillusioned with boththeir own and the Mesopotamian, Persian, andIndian religions as a consequence of Alexander’sconquests and cross-acculturation, termed thishedonism in its most animal-sensual aspect, andEpicureanism when exercised towards higher,philosophical concepts of pleasure.a. Bad Boys and GirlsConveniently - one might say perversely - theseparateness-condemning religions all provided,along with their OU-deities, a correspondingly-divine personification of that same separateness,such as the Egyptian Set and Hathor, the GreekDionysus and Aphrodite, the Persian Ahriman andTiamat, the Northern Loki and Hel, and of coursethe most [in]famous Abrahamic Satan. As OU-separateness was the “greatest sin”, then it stood toreason that its personification must be the source ofall evil, whose common characteristic wasdiscretionary will and action in disregard of OU-uniformity.b. “Indulgence Instead ofAbstinence” 133A second characteristic shared by OU-nonconformists was [and still is] having a good timeall the time, pre/posthumous, dis/incarnate. But itis not enough to merely wallow in wastefulness; the133 The motto created for the Church of Satan by AntonSzandor LaVey.- 182 -true Satanist134 must raise such expression toæsthetic as well as sybaritic excellence, as eloquentlyexpressed by Satan’s avatar:Call it - amusement. It is for amusement that Iexist. It is for that alone that I remain upon a world inwhich, when all is said and done, amusement in someform or guise is the one great aim of all, the only thingthat makes life upon it tolerable. My aim is, therefore,you perceive, a simple one. But what is it that amusesme?Three things. I am a great playwright, the greatestthat has ever lived, since my plays are real. I set thescenes for my little single acts, my farces andcomedies, dramas and tragedies, my epics. I direct theactors. I am the sole audience that can see everyaction, hear every line of my plays from beginning toend. Sometimes what began as a farce turns into hightragedy, tragedies become farces, a one-act diversiondevelops into an epic, governments fall, the mightytopple from their pedestals, the lowly are exalted.Some people live their lives for chess. I play my chesswith living chessmen, and I play a score of games atonce in all corners of the world. All this amuses me.Furthermore, in my character as Prince of Darkness,which I perceive that you do not wholly admit, my artputs me on a par with that other super-dramatist, myancient and Celestial adversary known according to thedominant local creed as Jehovah. Nay, it places mehigher - since I rewrite his script. This also amuses me.The second? I am a lover of beauty. It is, indeed,the one thing that can arouse in me what may be called- emotion. It happens now and then that man with hismind and eyes and heart and hands makes visible andmanifest some thing which bears that stamp ofcreative perfection the monopoly of which traditionascribes to the same Celestial adversary I have named.It may be a painting, a statue, a carved bit of wood, acrystal, a vase, a fabric - any one of ten thousand134 In its strictest sense this term identifies members of the1966-75 Church of Satan. However it is often usedconversationally to refer to all serious followers of the Left-Hand Path, without implying allegiance to the AbrahamicSatan.- 183 -things. But in it is that essence of beauty humanitycalls divine and for which, in its blundering way, it isalways seeking - as it is amusement. The best of thesethings I make from time to time my own. But - I willnot have them come to me except by my own way.Here enters the third element - the gamble, the game.Collector of souls and beauty I am. Gambler am I,too, and as supreme in that as in my collecting. It is theunknown quantity, the risk, that sharpens the edge ofmy enjoyment of my plays. It is what gives the finalzest to my - acquirements. And I am a generousopponent. The stakes those who play with me may winare immeasurably greater than any I could win fromthem. But play with me - they must!135c. From Hedonism to HellfireHellenistic Hedonism (the pursuit of pleasureand self-indulgence) and Epicureanism 136 were defacto atheistic, hence neither needed nor werecharacterized by any divine personage. Asthemselves they have continued unobtrusively intomodern times, generally ignoring and being ignoredby religious institutions - except occasionally,rhetorically as godless heathens and libertines. In aburst of impudence during the religious revulsion ofthe Age of Reason and Enlightenment, hedonismbecame naughtily fashionable as the British Hellfire135 Merritt, Abraham, Seven Footprints to Satan. Boni &Liveright, 1928.136 Epicureanism was a philosophy of hedonistic ethics thatconsidered calmness untroubled by mental or emotionaldisquiet the highest good, held intellectual pleasures superiorto others, and advocated the renunciation of momentarygratification in favor of more permanent pleasures.- 184 -Clubs, of which the most sensational was Sir FrancisDashwood’s Order of Medmenham Franciscans. 137In 1966 Anton Szandor LaVey founded theChurch of Satan in San Francisco, which advocated“Indulgence” in [legal] social hedonism along withreligious allegiance to Satan as its personification. 1382. The Temple of Set: XeperFollowing the demise of the Church of Satan in1975, its Priesthood founded the Temple of Set tocontinue its evolutionary adventure beyond thelimitations of Abrahamic iconography, returning tothe primal Egyptian neter Set in his most ancient,predynastic manifestation as a circumpolar stellarentity articulating the MindStar-enhancing principleof Xeper. 139Simultaneously the Temple adopted a moreEpicurean approach to society, while internallybecoming completely initiatory: encouraging Setianstowards the strengthening and expansion of theirindividual consciousness to personal divinity. 140137 Cf. Eric Towers, Dashwood: The Man and the Myth(London: Crucible, 1986), which offers evidence thatDashwood’s “occult” activities consisted largely of revels inhonor of Apollo & Bacchus with no overtly “Satanic” element.138 Cf. Michael Aquino, The Church of Satan (2 volumes) (8thEdition). San Francisco: Barony of Rachane, 2013. As theChurch did not address possible evolution of individualconsciousness beyond mankind’s present level, it wasessentially a non-initiatory, mass-membership organization. Itbecame initiatory only within the Satanic Priesthood [ofMendes]: Degrees III°-V°.139 In hieroglyphics: to Become of Come Into Being.140 Cf. Michael Aquino, The Temple of Set (2 volumes) (2ndEdition). San Francisco: Barony of Rachane, 2016.- 185 -As the Church of Satan began to learn in itsinitial evolution towards separate-consciousnessinitiation, and as the Temple of Set subsequentlyexperienced in correspondingly greater intensity,strengthening of the entire MindStar (“soul”) affectsthe entire spectrum of the mind, both conscious andsubconscious.3. ElectionIn suitably intelligent and emotionally-balancedindividuals (identified as the “Elect”) this iscontrolled, constructive, and exhilarating. In othersnot so qualified, however, mental evolution canresult in malignant emotionalism, even to self-destructiveness. 141Hence the vast majority of contemporaryhumanity are unsuited for initiatory religion - notnecessarily because of any deficiency in consciousintelligence or education, but rather because of themore subtle, unpredictable, and hazardous potentialof their subconscious. For such there is a need for anon-initiatory religion addressed to the pinnacle ofconsciousness - the supreme Good of the PlatonicAgathon - while leaving uncreated the id-monster.And that is the ambition of these lectures.141 This phenomenon was most famously illustrated in the 1956MGM science-fiction film Forbidden Planet, in which Dr.Morbius’ artificially-enhanced mind both increased hisconscious genius and materialized an “id-monster” from hissubconscious: wreaking uncontrollable havoc and ultimatelycausing his own death.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2BYyeS-fIU- 186 -4. ResponsesThere are two general human approaches to therealization of OU-distinction:a. Passive: DeismThe European Enlightenment included not onlya courageous confidence in both physical and socialscience, but a simultaneous rejection of the Judæo/Christian dogma which had previously constrainedEuropeans since the conversion of the RomanEmperor Constantine. If the J/C institutions couldnow be ignored with impunity, did that mean thatEl, Jesus Christ, et al. were nothing more thanobsolete fictions as well?Intellectuals disaffected with human J/Cinstitutions weren’t thereby ready to throw out theentrenched J/C mythology. Humans could befaulted for error and corruption; it was anothermatter to dismiss an intelligence behind all ofuniversal existence. Nor was it necessary: El & Co.could be ceremonially acknowledged and honored inhuman affairs - as long as they didn’t actuallymeddle in them.The term for this convenient compromise isDeism. It has since become and remained theprevalent manifestation of J/C religion worldwide,except in primitive, uneducated areas wheresuperstition still imprisons the minds of the fearfuland vulnerable.The existence of such Fundamentalist enclaves,as well as some degree of implicit superstitionamong even the more Enlightened populaces, hashad the side-effect of fashioning J/C religion into acoldly-utilitarian propaganda tool which can be used- 187 -to marshal emotional acceptance of and compliancewith otherwise-unjustifiable political agendas. 142Deists grapple with the isolate individualconsciousness by declining to address it directly. Itis no surprise that Deism historically coincides withhuman “social contract” theory, which replacesindividual consciousness with habitual and/orcontrolled “behaviorism” of the collective society.Thus questions of opinion, such as morality, areboth defined and judged according to theircontribution to the proscribed social structure.Individual responsibility becomes submerged andsuppressed in favor of the preservation andjustification of the state. It is irrelevant whether thisbe cloaked in the guise of an ideology such asfascism, republicanism, socialism, communism, etc.The abandonment of personal sovereignty andresponsibility is everywhere the same: treason is notexcused by individual conscience.Hence the Deist is necessarily a behavioristatheist; or more precisely he replaces El with thestate as the dictator of morality, and as justificationfor personal existence.Appropriately the right to generate or endindividual humans’ lives is an importantprerogative of the slave-religions, thus confirmingthe human’s status as a slave. In Deistic social-contract societies, this reproduction & executionpower is taken by the state. In either situation it isessential that it is not to be permitted to theindividual himself. Hence discretionary suicide, forinstance, is just as absolutely a “prohibited sin” insecular societies as in theocratic ones. The killing of142 For detailed discussion of religion as a governing andpropaganda control device, see my books MindWar andFindFar.- 188 -others by individuals is “murder” and severelypunished; by order of the church of state it is notonly forgiven but indeed formally and highlyhonored (military medals, etc.).It was Georg Hegel who proposed “the state asGod”, and Friedrich Nietzsche who took this onestep further and dispensed with the concept of“God” entirely, reducing humanity to a self-awareintelligence driven by and addicted to socialdomination: the “Will to Power”.The original social-contract theorists - ThomasHobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jaques Rousseau -held supernature in contempt, assigning religion toa mere sedative role in otherwise rational,materialistic society: It could be useful, perhaps, incalming and controlling the emotional masses.Usually this was implicit, as in the United Stateswherein it was utilized ceremonially, but the moreblunt fascists and communists contemptuouslydismissed it as, in Karl Marx’ words, “the opiate ofthe masses”.Deists are as unconcerned with El as theyassume El to be with them. This posture itself isanother type of faith, reinforced by the inductivelogic that, if El’s active interest in human affairs is tobe measured by his occasional violation of NL (e.g.“miracles”), there haven’t been any verified ones yet.What deists overlook in this equation is theexistence and NL-violation capability of sentient life,such as humankind. Deists’ failure to address thisglaring refutation of their conceit is the result ofeither the intellectual capacity to do so, or mereselective inattention. Either way it is a fatal flaw inthis attitude.- 189 -b. Active: Left-Hand Path InitiationThe ability to apprehend, conceptualize,appreciate, and imagine [simplify, represent,interpret through SU imagery] the OU requiresexternal perspective. 143This is a very simple and self-evident principle,yet one which is extremely frightening to mosthumans. It implies not just complete separatenessfrom the OU, but correspondingly completepersonal responsibility for the affirmation of one’sindividuality. NL, which in the OU is omnipresentand omnipotent, is here both absent and impotent -except where it encounters the MindStar in themedium of the physical human body.Ironically it was in the barren atmosphere ofsocial Deism that an active alternative to both thatDeism and the remnants of the slave-religions wouldarise: an initiatory metaphysical curriculum of the“Left-Hand Path”.Unlike its RHP counterpart, this initiation doesnot seek to [re]integrate the isolate self-consciousness of being with the OU, but rather toaffirm, strengthen, glorify, and increase it.In the mythologies of the slave-religions, such anaffirmation was not just a failing to seek thesubmergence of self that one’s “sinful” separationdemanded; it was in its defiance and rejection of thisgoal the “ultimate blasphemy”. Appropriately it waspersonified by the most heinous anti-El imaginable:143 This external point of perspective upon the 4 Dimensions ofthe OU is the 5th Dimension of isolate consciousness,expressed in the interpretative construction of SUs; thus in his1950s’ television series The Twilight Zone, Rod Serling aptlycalled it “the 5th Dimension of Imagination”. Cf. my FindFar.- 190 -the Judæo/Christian Satan or his counterparts inother cultural mythologies.Unsurprisingly deliberate acceptance andendorsement of individual separateness first tookreligious form in 1966 as the Church of Satan. 144Therein self-glorification gradually evolved fromnegative blasphemy to a positive adventure in itsown right. It was but a question of time before thisadventure would outgrow the primitive confines ofJ/C imagery altogether, emerging in 1975 as theChurch’s successor, the Temple of Set. 145What both the Church and the Temple learned,however, was that affirmation of and continualexistence in a state of absolute separateness is anemotional and intellectual strain. It is only initially,when it is indulged in occasionally as an eccentricity,that such stress is easily endurable. While it is theobject of LHP initiation to strengthen and prolongthe experience, this must be developed carefully,gradually so as not to provoke a crisis. Such crisescombine superhuman levels of consciousness withunanticipated, comparable levels of emotion; theresult can be an implosion of mental self-destruction. 146Pervading the entire LHP, moreover, is theoverwhelming awareness of absolute, ultracosmicisolation. The initiate exists literally as a god-being,144 For the definitive, comprehensive history of this institution,see my two-volume history, The Church of Satan.145 For the 1975-96 initial history and a summary of itsmetaphysical philosophy, see my two-volume work The Templeof Set.146 Such a crisis is perhaps most dramatically illustrated as the“Id-monster” of the classic 1956 film Forbidden Planet:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2BYyeS-fIU- 191 -independent of both the OU and other god-intelligences as well, yet not so powerful as towantonly disregard such external existences.And just as one’s own existence is unique, it hasno “default” to absorption or protection beyonditself. Omniexistence may fall to its opposite,nonexistence, the instance that self-energy fails.Intellectually and emotionally the LHP is acondition of continuous stress, increasing the higherthe initiatory level. The RHP is a condition ofcontinuous relaxation and harmony, also increasingthe higher the initiatory level. One of the results ofthe Temple of Set’s realizing this is that Setians, nomatter how advanced their initiation, intentionallyexist prehumously at the level of “basic confirmedinitiation” (signified in the Temple as Adept II°),rising to the functionality of any higher degreesattained only as necessary. Such a “safety valve” isunnecessary on the RHP, of course; indeed thatenvironment is quite the contrary: It is theoccasional requirement to function in the everydayworld as a non0initiate that increases stress.Posthumously both situations change for obviousreasons:The LHP entity is no longer attached to the OUthrough the physical body interface, hence no longerneeds to endure or adjust any condition of stress; itnow exists wholly and effortlessly in its own SU,from which the OU is just one of innumerableinteractive options.The posthumous RHP entity is correspondinglyfreed from its prehumous sense of separateness, andcan completely relax in OU-absorption. Indeed thisis the future that also awaits non-initiates [of eitherPath], the only difference being that they do notanticipate nor understand it. Nor, of course, will- 192 -their OU-separate 5D consciousness remain to betroubled in the least by this.The danger of the LHP thus has nothing to dowith conventional concepts of “evil”, but rather withthe awareness of the absoluteness of one’s being vs.the commensurately absolute nothingness that iseverywhere beyond. This is the crisis that Dr. Jessupexperienced, once he finally discovered that he hadto constantly create and preserve his own reality tokeep from dissolving into nothingness. Ultimatelythis is what distinguishes life from death, whatmakes it at once exhilarating and terrifying. As H.P.Lovecraft observed:Life is a hideous thing, and from the backgroundbehind what we know of it peer daemoniacal hints oftruth which make it sometimes a thousandfold morehideous. Science, already oppressive with its shockingrevelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminatorof our human species - if separate species we be - forits reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borneby mortal brains if loosed upon the world. 147LHP initiation thus demands only occasional“activation” initially. As one’s familiarity withmetaphysical stress increases, such experiences canbe increased, until it eventually becomes possible toexist continuously amidst this environmentality.It scarcely need be said that relatively fewhumans are capable of and suitable for such anextraordinary mode of conscious existence. If it wereotherwise - if LHP were comfortably optional foreveryone - these lectures would not be needed.So the challenge for the lectures is to discover iftheir is a truly dignified and fulfilling metaphysicalphilosophy for the many for whom LHP initiation is147 Lovecraft, H.P., Arthur Jermyn, 1920.- 193 -not an attainable, comfortable, or safe option. Inthis neither the deception of slave-religiousabsorption not the distractive conditioning of Deismis sufficient. Both are ultimately escapes from truth,from reality: John Fowles’ emotional “ports” forrelief from and assuagement of the “gnawingunknown” of conscious existence.Humanity both deserves and is capable of “abetter detective story”. 148The supernatural propositions examined thus farcontain the common premise of a metaphysicalcreative, ordering, and enforcing intelligence,whether single or multiple. Historically this premisearose from primitive, ignorant superstitionconcerning the otherwise-inexplicable mysteriessurrounding man’s life-experience and consciousperceptions. Over time more and more naturalphenomena were discovered to conform toregularities and underlying commonalities innature. As such observations were codified into laws- NL - where, enabling man to predict characteristicsand functions generally. The more NL was codified,the less there remained of “natural mysteries”.Today the whole of NL is so well-known thathumanity can confidently apply it across the OU,predicting and estimating objects and events eventhough they may not be directly detectable orobservable. Natural science is confident that it hassolved the riddle of the “how” of the OU, with onlyrarified or complicated details yet to be resolved.This knowledge has dispelled not only theoriginal mysteries of antiquity, but also their148 Cf. the extract from John Fowles’ Aristos as the thematicquotation introducing this book.- 194 -superstitious attribution to supernatural beings.God is dead, slain by science.Understanding the “how”, however, does notexplain the “why”; and it is precisely that “why” thatactually necessitates a prior creating, ordering, andenforcing power.So the necessity for humanity’s enquiry intoitself, and into its surroundings, remains. Unlike the“how”-questions there is no practical utility oradvantage in the answer. It is the “how” thatincreases the comfort and power of human life. Aslong as the “why” does not intrude into humanexperience, it can be ignored.It is therefore the task of the slave-religions toconvince humans that the “why” (El) does intrude,does overcome NL when so intruding. The proof ofEl is now alleged in such intrusions and violations:“miracles”. If humans can be convinced thatmiracles do indeed occur, they can be threatenedand controlled by fear of harmful ones, or promiseof favorable ones.This is the climate of contemporary institutionalslave-religion, Abrahamic or otherwise. It promisesrescue from the fear, securing of the favor. Andbecause this necessitates linkage, bondage betweenhumanity and El, it demands [re]absorption as itsend. Allowing separation and distinction to persistwould imply that ElNL has no control over theindividual human, except for miraculous violationsof NL to generate deliberate hazards.Belief in the reality of miracles varies withindividual humans. Generally the more educated theindividual, the better his grasp of NL and the lesssusceptible he is to conclude that occurrences asmiraculous.- 195 -But before we can examine the implications ofand alternative approaches to “why”, we mustconsider those who reject the entire question, or atleast deem it unanswerable.E. RejectionThere are two categories of “why”-rejectionists:those who refuse to confront the question of “why”and those who contend that they have confronted itand concluded that it does not actually exist. Theformer are termed “agnostics”, the latter “atheists”.It is common to simplify these in terms of beliefin the slave-religion El.While it is not specifically relevant to thesubstance of their positions, agnostics and atheistscondemn themselves to regarding their existence asthat of mere stimulus/response animals - intelligentmechanisms, to be sure, but nonetheless still onlymechanisms, of no more significance orconsequence than a river or an automobile. Theyshrug off creative imagination as mere electro-chemical imbalances in the brain, certainly notevidence of anything beyond the naturally-mechanical.Accordingly neither would welcome a book suchas this: agnostics because it disturbs theirdisinterested relaxation and atheists because itthreatens their complacency.Now a closer look at each:1. Passive: AgnosticismThe J/C agnostic doesn’t assert the conviction ofthe atheist - generally because of mere laziness. Heis a postponer, who sees in avoidance of decision the- 196 -avoidance of making a wrong decision. As El doesnot seem to be on his doorstep, he can be ignoredpro tem.2. Active: AtheismAs the record of El is mythological - the fables ofthe J/C Holy Bible - all the atheist need do isdismiss that document as primitive andpreposterous superstition to prove his point: El isnothing more than an old fairytale.The problem here, however, is that the atheist isall too anxious to limit the question to mereacceptance/rejection of Biblical mythology. He doesnot demand that his position also stand the test ofother conventional religions, like those of Asia orNative America. That is too much trouble, and itjeopardizes the simple smugness he enjoys with hisAbrahamic coup de grace.In academia the term “scholasticism” refers toreasoning deliberately towards the support of apredetermined conclusion. Facts are acknowledgedand accepted only if they support the argument, andignored or denounced if they do not.Scholasticism became [in]famous duringmedieval and Renaissance times for the J/C-supporting “learned” arguments of Christians suchas Augustine and Aquinas (both duly sanctioned byCatholic canonization). Theoreticians not feeling thenecessity to support “scripture” were not sohonored: Niccoló Machiavelli’s name was given tothe Devil as “Old Nick”.Today one still searches in vain for a professedatheist who has announced his position only after anon-scholasticisic search through all possible doorsto the truth. It is precisely this precariousness which- 197 -makes their proclaimed confidence so brittle - andwhy they thus react to challenges perfunctorily, evenangrily.F. CoexistenceSo far we have identified and considered thosewho accept the metaphysical and those who don’t.This presages a contest, a war between them toestablish who’s correct and who’s not. Each can anddoes accuse the other of being stupid, deceived, and/or deliberately lying.Since the Enlightenment, Western social-contract cultures have sought a political climate thattolerates all manner of disagreement, including onquestions of religion. Thus the AmericanC o n s t i t u t i o n ’ s F i r s t A m e n d m e n t d e n i e s“establishment of religion”, and many othercountries attempt, if not always successfully, totolerate and protect various conceits of belief ornonbelief.The obvious problem here is that both sidescannot be factually correct, and within the “belief”side only one of many can be correct. [It is alsopossible that all of the known beliefs are flawed, andthat the accurate one has not yet been discovered,formulated, or acknowledged.]Thus “agreeing to disagree” may avoid conflict,but it leaves the underlying question awkwardly,ominously unanswered.- 198 -1. Tolerancea. Indifferent PracticalityThe implicit statement of a communitytolerating all forms of non/belief is that itadjudicates the issue as either trivial orunanswerable; so the practical solution is to keep itfrom being socially disruptive as much as possible.Considering all the other challenges of life andsociety, there is certainly something practical to besaid for this approach.Along with any metaphysical reality, however,comes a certain moral standard of the Good and theEvil, from the transcendental to the personal.Absent such a moral compass, society must craftsome other basis for establishing Right and Wrong,virtue and vice. This may range from absoluteindividual hedonism, as in an anarchistic utopia, toarbitrary commands in the case of totalitariansocieties. Common to both is that they areexclusively human-crafted, and neither make norseek any “higher” justification.Historically grievous harm has been done in thename of religion - but just as often in its absence. Soreligion per se is not necessarily the destructiveinfluence; it is quite possibly its inadequate,inaccurate understanding and application. At theother extreme we know conclusively that itscomplete absence is not the solution to humanity’smoral sufferings.b. Hypocritical PretenseA Religious construction of existence isnecessarily unique, exclusive. There cannot be two- 199 -different realities, explanations for what exists andwhy.The mere presence of two or more religions thusestablishes that all but one are incorrect. [It is alsopossible that none is correct.] Since conventionalreligion considers non-belief an affront to the god(s)of choice, deserving punishment of both non-believer and belivers who fail to advocate anddefend their god(s), sincerely-held religionsnecessitate intolerance and antagonism, historicallyto the extent of persecution, torture, execution, andwar - such as the Crusades, the European ThirtyYears’ War. and in our own time armed conflictbetween the Judæo/Christian West and the IslamicEast.If a society establishes and maintains a policyand social atmosphere of religious tolerance, thisindicates that the dominant religion(s) is a post-Enlightenment social convenience rather than aseriously held governance. An obvious example isthe United States, which utilizes and enjoys festivalssuch as Easter and Christmas, and opens formalitieswith generic invocations, but in actuality takes noneof it seriously.Serious belief exists only in smaller sects whichdo not have the numbers or influence to controlgovernment mechanisms. Extremist expressions bysuch groups are comfortably ignored unless theybecome dangerous to others, in which situationsthey are punished or dissolved.A tolerant nation is thus an atheistic nation infact, if not in self-image.- 200 -2. InvisibilityIf a religious group exists amidst an intolerantsociety, and does not wish to be persecuted orextinguished, an alternative is to “go/remainunderground”: to function as a secret society,escaping notice. 149 If done skillfully this may suffice.The obvious risk is that if it is discovered andpublicized, its secrecy may be interpreted asconspiracy, a threat to the above-ground socialnorm. This may result in even more extreme andintensive persecution.This was an ominous lesson which the Temple ofSet learned the hard way. Upon its 1975 founding, inan effort to avoid the shallow publicity that hadbedeviled (!) the Church of Satan, the Templedeclined all publicity, concentrating instead onSetians’ initiation. In the 1980s the United Statesunderwent a decade of “Satanic conspiracy”hysteria. While the old Church of Satan was ignoredas a “known comic irrelevancy, the Temple of Setwas immediately feared precisely because it was apublic mystery. This was dispelled only after years ofsubsequent public explanation by Setians, afterwhich they turned once again to their personal,private initiatory interests.a. InconsequenceAnother option of a minority group is tomaintain an open, public presence but appear to beso absurd and ludicrous as to be comfortablyignorable.149 Indeed this expression may have originated in reality: theearly Christians’ tactic of meeting secretly and protectively inRome’s catacombs.- 201 -When he founded the Church of Satan in 1966,Anton LaVey realized that if society regarded it asseriously literal, he and it could be in great danger ofofficial persecution and vigilante terrorism. His[successful] solution was to present the Church’spublic face as mere comic burlesque - an insincere“Halloween party” for decadents and satirists.Behind closed doors it was quite the other thing, butits public image effectively precluded gunshots andfirebombs. 150b. IncomprehensibilityStill another version of “hiding in plain sight” isto maintain doctrines, literature, and activities socomplex and intellectually abstract as to beincomprehensible to the uninitiated outsider.Just as most humans passively accept familyconditioning into its inherited, traditionalconventional religion, they rarely, upon reachingadulthood, feel motivated either to question or rejectit. In addition to the obvious familial disruption andfriction this would cause, conventional religion isseen as “not worth the bother”, intruding as it doesso little in practical, daily life.This may obviously not be the case in the world’smore primitive and superstitious religious-fundamental cultures, but it is arguably tacit in thepost-Enlightenment West.Should one wish to challenge indoctrinatedreligion, moreover, there are usually manypassionate if irrational obstacles declaimed by faith-150 At least for the most part. Within a short time after theChurch’s founding, Anton & Diane LaVey found it necessary toinstall protective barriers in front of their home in resonse todrive-by gunfire and vandalism.- 202 -preservationists. Such superstition is unmoved byrational argument; indeed it is all the moreentrenched and fanatic. The “heretic” soon realizesthat his questions or arguments are regarded only asinsolence and insult. The option of least resistance isto shrug the entire matter off.An alternative to the conspicuously-obviousfutility of “[re]absorption of the separate, consciousself” in an OU completely alien to it is the simpler,more direct goal of self-obliteration.This is not as easy as committing physicalsuicide, however.In the Abrahamic religions suicide is a principalsin: a violation of the sixth Mosaic commandment:“Thou shalt not kill.” Significantly this absoluteapplication of the maxim, on pain of the worstposthumous punishment, is just as absolutelyignored with regard to other forms of life, bothhuman and nonhuman. So strong is the suicidetaboo, nevertheless, that it is outlawed in everyAbrahamic-tradition nation. Only in recent yearshave exceptions been rarely and selectively allowed,in imminently-terminal cases of extreme suffering,and then only under strict physician supervision.And where such exceptions to the taboo-law havebeen approved, it was not not without bitteropposition from the religions.Buddhism, while based on the principle that “all[OU-separate, conscious] existence is sorrow”,nevertheless severely punishes suicidal escape bythe consequences of a next-reincarnation of thatmuch greater misery: retributive karma. Buddhists’only permitted relief consists of exercises to dull andstarve one’s consciousness into the incoherent hazeof nirvana. While mythically permanent for theBuddha and bodhisattva, it is a mocking illusion for- 203 -the ordinary adherent, who obviously cannot escapethe continuous demands of his body andenvironment.In Hinduism suicides are additionallycondemned to an undead, ghostlike torment onEarth, until such time as they would “naturally”have died.The hypocrisy of the suicide-taboo in the face ofroutine, massive slaughter of others, raises theobvious question of ulterior motive. Societies existprincipally to control and exploit their subjects,often in conditions of extreme privation andsuffering. Such individual misery is only enduredbecause no escape from it is allowed, bothpsychologically via religious propaganda andpractically by outlawing any peaceful, painlessmethod such as barbiturate overdose. The onlyoptions remaining for would-be suicides are violent,painful, and unreliable ones such as gunshot,hanging, or jumping from high buildings or bridges.Nevertheless attempts not only continue but aresteadily increasing. 151G. Inattention: Hellenistic PhilosophiesThe Hellenistic era of Alexandrian Greece, inaddition to discrediting the old punitive religionsand spawning enjoyable options such as hedonismand Epicureanism, also saw the appearance of151 There were 42,773 recorded suicides in the United States in2014 according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). On average,adjusted for age, the annual U.S. suicide rate increased 24%over the 15 previous years (1999 to 2014), from 10.5 to 13.0suicides per 100,000 people, the highest rate recorded in 28years.- 204 -philosophies which sought a rational basis forhuman behavior in the face of an unconscious,automatic OU in which, if any gods existed, theywere indifferent to humanity.1. SkepticismSkepticism is the doctrine that any trueknowledge is impossible, or that all knowledge isuncertain - a position that no fact or truth can beestablished on philosophical grounds. If nothing canbe conclusively known, argue Skeptics, then virtuelies in avoidance of judgment and thus of action.Beyond the individual, the community (polis) issomething to be reluctantly endured for whateverrelief from negative values it offers. It is not apositive thing in itself.2. StoicismStoicism is a philosophical system holding that itis man's duty to freely conform to NL and hisdestiny, that virtue is the highest good, and that thewise man should be free from passion, equallyunperturbed by joy or grief.3. CynicismCynicism advocates a rejection of worldly goodsand involvement and a concentration on virtue asthe only worthy goal. Cynicism's simpleopportunism - taking what life offers, for better orworse - was eventually absorbed into the ethicalposture of Stoicism.[index-205_1.png]- 205 -"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7: FOURTH LECTUREREAWAKENINGThe most merciful thing in the world, Ithink, is the inability of the human mind tocorrelate all its contents. We live on a placidisland of ignorance in the midst of black seasof infinity, and it was not meant that weshould voyage far. The sciences, each strainingin its own direction, have hitherto harmed uslittle; but some day the piecing together ofdissociated knowledge will open up suchterrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightfulposition therein, that we shall either go madfrom the revelation or flee from the deadlylight into the peace and safety of a new darkage.- H.P. LovecraftThe Call of CthulhuPh'nglui mglw'nafh Dagon Az’tlan wgah'naglfhtagn.A. Janus: Past and FutureIn the three previous lectures we haveexamined the Terrestrial conditions and influenceswhich have driven surfacers to seek answers to- 206 -questions beyond those answerable by OU science:to craft various religions and religion-alternatives.We have seen that none of these has proven tobe wholly or even substantially satisfactory, theresult being ongoing instability, neurosis, andemotional violence among humans generally.We have concluded that the education andsophistication of initiation holds the most promisefor succor from this peril. Of the two initiatoryavenues, the Left- and Right-Hand Paths, we haveconcluded that the former is suitable for only a veryfew due to its psychological stress. The RHP defaultsas the initiation of choice for most humans, butexisting RHP vehicles are inadequate due mostly totheir incoherent understanding of themselves, theirrandom mixture of physical and metaphysicalincompatibilities, and their persisting enchainmentto vestiges of human slave-religions.What we propose to do now is to craft asolution, outline a RHP concept and curriculum thatwill be epistemologically valid, educationally sound,and personally uplifting and ennobling.Our case-study institution for this research hasbeen the Ancient & Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis: theRosicrucians of San Jose, California. AMORC is notonly the largest and most enduring RHPorganization in existence, but it already possesses aphysical environment well-suited to reformation, inits Egyptian-themed Rosicrucian Park, Library,Museum, etc. All that is needed is a reconsiderationand refreshing of its structure and curriculum torender it a truly excellent medium for humanity.Before looking at specific internal designfeatures, we must clarify the concept of andjustification for RHP initiation generally. Only thencan we address AMORC’s raison d’être.- 207 -B. Telos1. SymboliqueTelos (from the Greek τέλος for “end”, “purpose”,or “goal”) originates in Egyptian Symbolism152 asthe principle that the design and organization of anobject, a life-form, or a process inherently requirespreconception based on purpose.Conventional academic doctrine is that livingbeings’ purpose is selectively the result ofenvironmental survival needs: Darwinian “naturalselection”: There is no inherent purpose to life-forms beyond passive/reactive survival, avoidance ofpain, seeking of pleasure, and instinct to reproduce.2. LamarckPrior to Darwin’s theory of passive naturalselection, the French biologist Jean BaptisteLamarck (1744-1829), while not denying suchpassive evolution, augmented it with what hetermed “soft evolution” (in modern parlance“Lamarckism”). Under this theory, characteristicsdeveloped or acquired by a given living being can beinherited by its progeny, thus adding the element ofintentional purpose to evolution.If Lamarckism is allowed to operate according tohuman intellectual will, of course, then the principle152 Plutarch: “First I want to interpret for you the theology ofthe Egyptians. Through symbols they reveal certain mysticalideas that are hidden and invisible, just as nature in itsperceptible forms has to a certain extent expressed withsymbols the invisible reasons for things.” - Schwaller deLubicz, Isha, Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate. New York: InnerTraditions, 1967, page #271.- 208 -of purpose on the individual human scale isestablished. This in turn suggests that there may bea greater element of purpose above and beyond theindividual: one or more neteru who manifestthrough that individual, both physically andconsciously.While heretical to the Darwinian establishment,which is rigidly deistic if not outright atheistic, sucha master-principle of purpose was neither unknownnor repugnant to the ancients, who by the time ithad reached Greece from Egypt referred to it astelos.3. TeleologyTeleology is the doctrine that final causes ofphenomena exist. Further that purpose and designare a part of or are apparent in nature. Further thatphenomena are not only guided by mechanicalforces (e.g. passive natural selection), but also movetowards certain goals of self-realization.4. MechanismThe opposite of teleology is mechanism, whichdescribes phenomena in terms of prior causesinstead of their presumed destination or fulfillment.[Modern science is thus mechanistic.]5. Human Fieldsa. LifeAs discovered by Dr. Harold Saxon Burr of YaleUniversity, the human body is surrounded by anelectromagnetic field establishing the telos of that- 209 -organism. 153 Since the body is in a continuous stateof metabolic breakdown and reconstitution at themolecular level, the “L-Field” is the “blueprint”ensuring exact replacement and repair.b. ThoughtVerifying the Egyptians’ concept of the eightfoldMindStar (later simplified and approximated as the“soul”), human thought is also characterized by fieldproperties within and without the physical brain. 154This is the explanation for non-localized, instantmemory of photographic precision and elaboration,and for the posthumous immortality of completely-conscious identity in the MindStar. 1556. Initiatory Structural ReflectionTo be effective as an individual-enhancingmedium, and initiatory school and its curriculummust align to and extend the individual telos of eachinitiate. Thus, in Plato’s vernacular, the school is“the individual writ large”. Far from being difficultto create, once this principle is realized and153 Burr, Harold Saxon, M.D., The Fields of Life: Our Linkswith the Universe. New York: Ballantine Books #23559, 1972.L-Fields are also discussed in detail in the author’s MindWar(San Francisco: Barony of Rachane, 2016).154 Russell, Edward W., Design for Destiny. New York:Ballantine Books #23405, 1971. T-fields are also discussed indetail in the author’s MindStar (San Francisco: Barony ofRachane, 2016).155 Cf. the author’s MindStar. See also the brief summary inAppendix #1.- 210 -understood, it “applies itself” with instinctive easeand accuracy.Correspondingly, should this principle not beunderstood and an “initiatory school/curriculum”attempted in ignorance of it, the result will be atokenistic failure.C. Augean StablesReconstituting AMORC into the ideal RHPinitiatory medium requires the proverbial “cleansheet of paper”: a priori elimination of all of thecrippling insubstantialities of the present profile.Like the famous Augean Stables - the cleaning ofwhich was Hercules’ Fifth Labor - the “problematicmaterial” has been building up for a considerabletime: a century of tradition and familiarity.Discarding it is thus something of a shock, evenaccompanied by immediate olfactory relief. OldRosicrucian dogs don’t learn new tricks any easierthan their quadrupedal counterparts. But it is anecessary, and unavoidable first step:1. Fire ElAt this point the damage done by the cult of El inall its manifestations can be neither ignored norexcused. This Hebraic appropriation of thatCanaanite deity has locked humanity into astraitjacket of sadomasochistic self-destruction,pure and simple.Here it is important to note that El is not beingexchanged for his “evil” counterpart, Satan - anymore than for convenient accessories such as Jesusand Mohammed. The complete mythos disappears.- 211 -This does not leave the OU bereft of brains; butin El’s place will be something much better, aselaborated below.2. Discard Hindu ReincarnationFor the simple reason that, like its parentmythology, it is factually false. AMORC adopted itonly as an “escape-clause” for the presumedconsequence of failing to achieve RHP perfection ina single Earthly lifetime, leaving the Rosicrucianfacing exactly the same posthumous fate as hisJudæo-Christian counterpart - Sheol or Heaven/Hell - all his initiatory efforts counting for absolutelynothing.Happily the Hindu crutch is not needed at all,because, as again will be seen below, actualposthumous prospects are blissfully benign.3. Discard Cabalistic CurriculumThis is actually much easier than one mightimmediately think, because AMORC has in effectalready jettisoned it in all but titular semblance.As these lectures have recounted, the Cabalistic“Tree of Life” degree/grade system of historicRosicrucianism is based on nothing more than thebaldfaced fiction of the Zohar. Not only is thereabsolutely no basis for the Zohar in the Tamakh ofJudaism, but in the absence of Christian “Grace”there would still be no escape from Sheol.However, as we have also seen, AMORC’sMonographic progression through the Sephirothtitles of the “Tree” is completely illusory. Only thedegree-names have been retained, but in themselvesclearly of no significance whatever. Why should an- 212 -“Exempt Adept” or a “Magister Templi” be calledthat?In place of the traditional Cabalistic occultgraffiti, useful only to increase the student’s naïveawe as “secret teachings”, AMORC has at leastprovided a refresher-course in elementary naturalscience and bodily health. This is good as far as itgoes - particularly against a social background ofdisintegrating secondary-school education! But,ironically, in so doing it has become too ordinary,too prosaic. It lacks what might be called the“sensitivity to wonder” that should set true initiatorywisdom apart from conventional education.The new curriculum will cover much of the sameground, but always amidst a glow of elevatedwisdom. Meaningless degree-titles will alsodisappear.4. Abandon HypocrisyAMORC presently advertises and emphasizesthat it is “not a religion” - which, as we have seen, itobviously and conspicuously is - in fear ofprejudicial condemnation and persecution by thevastly-larger slave-religion world beyond the SanJose Park.Prima facie this is futile: The slave-religionsdenounce it as a “cult” nonetheless, and all the moreso the more visible and successful it is.It is also counterproductive for three reasons:First, it prevents the organization from availingitself of the Constitutional protections and taxbenefits to which it is legitimately entitled as a bonafide religion.Second, it confuses its own membership, whofind themselves doing the same semantic dance- 213 -between the El of their nominal religion and the“Cosmic” of AMORC’s sheep’s-clothing one.Third, this policy of pretended secularismprevents AMORC from acknowledging the actualprimal Forms and Forces of the OU: the neteruthemselves. The result is an awkward, embarrassinghypocrisy of temples empty of divine presence,images of metaphysical beings dead instead of beingmedia for the neteru they portray, and ritualisticincantations to nothingness.5. Founding ForgivenessAs we have seen, AMORC was started as acomically clumsy, if harmless fraud. Harvey SpencerLewis felt strongly enough about his experienceswith European occultism - principally ContinentalRosicrucianism and the Ordo Templi Orientis - toattempt something similar to the United States. His1915 AMORC was the result.This new organization enjoyed spectacularsuccess over the succeeding decades, including mostnotably the creation of its magnificent headquartersPark in San Jose.Doctrinally Lewis steered clear of O.T.O.Freemasonry and “sex magic”, as well as the motleymorass of Zohar Cabalism hamstringing EuropeanRosicrucianisms.Instead, against the cultural background ofAmerican Deism, Lewis and his friends constructedand developed a much more down-to-Earthcurriculum, mysterious only because of its restricteddistribution.Lewis himself, as many aspiring occultists,enjoyed inventing and assuming impressive titlesand dignities, but there is no evidence that he did so- 214 -to deceive or defraud anyone.He simply enjoyed hisposturing, and clearly the rest of AMORC did too.At present, as indicated by its panic over thediscovery of its original 1915 “birth certificate” inNew York, AMORC is at pains to sell itself as notjust an impeccable United States institution, but oneclaiming both lineage all the way back to Akhenatenas well as affiliation by almost every intellectual ofnote throughout the intervening millennia.This is patently absurd, serving only to drape theorganization with an unhelpful image of comicfantasy.The simple truth is that AMORC has adequatelystood the test of time to stand quite creditably on itsown authentic accomplishments, again notably itsPark, Museum, Library, Planetarium, and relatedfacilities of research and learning. It doesn’t need toapologize for its true history, nor for its founder.There is nothing shameful or dishonorable infounding floundering, nor in growing-pains,The entire host country - the United States -itself experienced both, including to the catastropheof a terrible Civil War, and is today still working outthe wrinkles.By eliminating the braggadocio and bombastics,AMORC will be in that much better a position toaffirm pridefully its genuine accomplishments.Along with dropping all need for artificiality andpretense, the new AMORC will also have no need tofear the integrity and conscientiousness of its ownmembership. The degrading, paranoid “Postulant’sPlea” can be tossed into the nearest wastebasket - asindeed all policies demanding secrecy, except for thehonest appreciation of the privacy and privilege offormal ceremonies and magical workings.- 215 -6. Structural SoundnessPresently AMORC is an opaque private business:formalized in the State og California as a “publicbenefit corporation” but as such neither religiousnor non-profit. It possesses a Chief Executive Officerin the person of its Grand Mistress, but also anambiguously-legal “worldwide Imperator” in France.From personal experience its corporate board ofdirectors appears to be merely a convenient facaderather than a supervisory body to which the GM isoperationally responsible.Below this murky authority, the AMORCmembership appears to have neither power norprotection. Initiatory titles convey no tenure at all.A reformed AMORC can and should replace thiswith a non-profit religious corporation, with acompletely open and membership-participatorydesign. I do not mind in the least suggesting theArticles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Templeof Set, Inc. as a model; these have functionedsmoothly and efficiently for forty years [andcounting]. 156D. ReconstitutionBy now it should come as no surprise that, inplace of the discarded frauds, failings, andfalsehoods. AMORC should adopt and activate theinitiatory heritage and model of ancient Egypt - not156 These documents are reprinted in their entirety asAppendices to Volume II of my book The Temple of Set. Inaddition to their organizational functionality, they fullyqualified the Temple for both federal and California state tax-exemption as a religious institution from the date of its 1975founding.- 216 -as mere architectural veneer or artistic image, butwholeheartedly in its metaphysical universality.1. CosmologyAMORC is a medium, a school advocating andteaching RHP initiation. As these lectures haveconcluded, the ideal and practical in this azimuthlead first to a Gaiaistic compatibility with andrespect for NL while incarnate as a human being,followed by seamless harmony with the OU inposthumous peacefulness and pleasure.This should not be mistaken for mere mysticisticvagueness. It is nothing of the sort. Rather the entireinitiatory adventure is one of increasing awarenessof the actual essence and energy of the OU, such thatthe separate individual learns precisely how to alignand harmonize with it, melding with it without anyfriction, disruption, or need for self-annihilation.The Egyptians recognized the OU to be not thecrude singularity of later, simplistic cults, but aperfectly-integral multiplicity of primal Principles,Forms: the neteru whose collective combines to bereflected and interpreted by humanity as NL.It is in this harmonic heterogeneity that the 4-Dimensional natural neteru differ fundamentallyfrom the singularity of the non-natural neter of the5th Dimension, Set.2. Curriculum to AdeptAn AMORC teacher glancing through the aboveAugean agenda may have been perturbed by theprospect of tossing the tradition-entrenchedMonographs into the nearest Naglee Avenue- 217 -dumpster. The very thought seems shuddersomesacrilege! Nevertheless:Wherever, therefore, lie has built unto itself athrone, let it be assailed without pity and withoutregret, for under the domination of a falsehood, nonation can permanently prosper.Let established sophisms be dethroned, rootedout, burnt and destroyed, for they are standing menaceto all true nobility of thought and action.Whatever alleged “truth” is proven by results to bebut an empty fiction, let it be unceremoniously flunginto the outer darkness among the dead gods, deadempires, dead philosophies, and other useless lumberand wreckage.The most dangerous of all enthroned lies is theholy, the sanctified, the privileged lie - the lie that“everybody” believes to be a model truth. It is thefruitful mother of all other popular errors anddelusions. It is hydra-headed. It has a thousand roots.It is a social cancer.The lie that is known to be a lie is half eradicated,but the lie that even intelligent persons regard as asacred fact - the lie that has been inculcated around amother’s knee - is more dangerous to contend againstthan a creeping pestilence.Popular lies have ever been the most potentenemies of personal liberty. There is only one way todeal with them: Cut them out to the very core, just ascancers are. Exterminate them root and branch, orthey will surely eat us all up. We must annihilate them,or they will us. 157Happily - one might be so bold as to saypropitiously - the old Monographs’ sublimesuccessor already exists in the form of amagnificently marvelous set of books:157 Redbeard, Ragnar, Might is Right (1890). The entirediatribe, forgotten for half a century, achieved a new audience[and notoriety] when Anton LaVey included it as “The Book ofSatan” in his Satanic Bible (1969).[index-218_1.jpg][index-218_2.jpg][index-218_3.jpg][index-218_4.jpg]- 218 -- 219 -Isha Schwaller de Lubicz’ Her-Bak books 158 areneither secret nor surprise to AMORC; they haveappeared on thematic bibliographies, recommendedbackground reading for guided tours of Egypt, etc.What they haven’t been is the backbone forAMORC’s own course of initiation, and the reasonfor this is quite obvious: They openly and explicitlyacknowledge the neteru, and eschew completely theJudæo-Christian monotheistic cult of El.As AMORC is now to be free of that cult, and ofthe pretense of “not being a religion”, the exotericand esoteric wisdom encompassed within thesebooks can be embraced fully and completely, not asmere fiction, but profound representation of reality.They simply, elegantly, change from novels totextbooks - as they are well-conceived to be.In Her-Bak Isha expertly and fluently was able tosynthesize the extensive and complex themes of herhusband René Schwller de Lubicz’ work. His initialrealization came from his study of hieroglyphs: thatin addition to their service as alphabetics, theyembodied symbolic principles apprehensible to boththe rational and the suprarational intelligence. [Hismethodology is thus often termed Symbolique(“Symbolism”).]Gradually René extended his awareness of thiskey to Egyptian culture into its architecture (as inhis magnum opus examination of the Luxor templecomplex, Le Temple de L’Homme) and pre-Pythagoreanism.The old AMORC Monographs grant “initiatorydegrees” absent any examination or evaluation158 Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, Her-Bak: The Living Face ofAncient Egypt, and Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate. Both volumesare published by Inner Traditions, New York, in continuousprint since 1967.- 220 -whatever. And, as they amount to a sprawling reviewof secondary-school sciences & health topics, readerretention would be both difficult and of minimalendurance. A senior Temple initiate, if queried,would find it difficult to justify all the Monographictime spent over several years.By contrast, the first Her-Bak volume ( TheLiving Face of Ancient Egypt) is neither aninstructional nor a memory exercise. Rather it is ajourney though a wide variety of naturalenvironments and situations, in each with the samepurpose of awakening and sensitizing the student toits Symbolique.What is being inculcated, therefore, is anattitude and an awareness, which can and willbe invoked in any future situation, revealing itsrichness of meaning behind the merely apparentand superficial.3. Degree Concept and StructureHere it is appropriate to interrupt the curriculumto propose the commensurate degree redesign.The old AMORC system, as previously detailed inthese lectures and supplements, consists of twoinitial-affiliation designations, followed by nine full-membership (“Temple”) degrees, followed by an“Illuminati Section” trailing off into jargonisticvagueness.The new system, which is modeled after that ofthe Temple of Set, consists of four degrees:Rosicrucian I°Adept II°Priest/Priestess of # [specific neter] III°Sage IV°- 221 -When an individual joins AMORC, he or she is afull member, but one of undemonstrated initiatorycompetence. Curriculum consists of learning,appreciating, and demonstrating the initiatorystate of being illustrated in the first Her-Bakvolume, for which there is a two-year time-limit.Within that window each I° is expected to evidenceto the satisfaction of two II°+s that he/she is adeptin such awareness and ability to apply these, whichsis precisely the point of recognizing the individualas Adept II°.The II° is the credential of the qualifiedRosicrucian, and is where most will remain duringincarnation.I°s who fail to qualify for the II° within two yearsthereby indicate that they do not possess either themotivation or the intelligence to become Adept.They are courteously de-affiliated.As an authentic religion of the natural neteru,the new AMORC assumes the authority to recognizeinitiates of such intuitive sensitivity to a specificneter as to represent its focus and presence. Suchare dignified as Priest or Priestess III° of that neter(necessarily exclusively one). It is the responsibilityof each such Priesthood to represent the wisdomand interests of that neter primarily within theactivities of AMORC, but not excluding, whereappropriate, the non-initiatory world beyond.Sages IV° are III°s of any Priesthood who, byvirtue of their comprehension of and versatilitywithin the OU as a whole, are recognized with thisdignity for their expertise and ability to bring it tobear in any situation.Executive and administrative offices are distinctfrom the initiatory degree system, though eachofficial must hold the II°+.- 222 -4. Curriculum Beyond AdeptThe second volume of Her-Bak ( EgyptianInitiate) continues the protagonist’s adventure intoconsecration as a Priest [in the story] of Amon-Ra.The consecration, however, is clearly an illustrationof what, with appropriate variation, would apply tothe priesthood of any one of the natural neteru.Thus while this Volume II can be read by anyone,personal experience of the stages and eventsdescribed therein is expected of the Adept aspiringto any such priesthood. At first these will be highlyindividualistic: the result of intense individual studyof the neter in question. Gradually, as a body of suchknowledge is built up, an established priesthood ofeach neter will emerge and both oversee andvalidate (“Recognize”) authentic priesthoods.At this point of prospectus, a process for formalIV° Recognition remains to be established; this willcome when it is called for. Assimilation of thecomplete works of René Schwaller de Lubicz may beconsidered a good point of departure.E. LensAs this lecture, as this series of lectures comes toa close, we are reminded that - the citations, history,arguments, causticity, even humor notwithstanding- the research, correlations, conclusions, andpresentation are valuable only insofar as they focusupon and bring into sharp clarity a very importantTruth. Absent this the entire exercise defaults tomere diversion, rising perhaps to entertainment.But I submit that IlluminAnX is indeed such alens.- 223 -There is an accumulation of physical knowledgethrough the media of the material senses duringincarnate existence.There is also an accumulation of metaphysicalknowledge through the media of the MindStaremanations exclusive of incarnate physicalsensation.IlluminAnX is a lens to identify and correlatethese into a coherent, comprehensive reality ofindividual consciousness. As a lens it enables what ison either side of it to be viewed from the perspectiveof the other, enabling a synthesis that would not bepossible without such comparison and correlation.Initiation is at its root just such a process ofdetection, description, and correlation.Prior to IlluminAnX it has existed functionallyfor the Left-Hand Path since 1975 CE.But the Right-Hand Path has fallen short ofsimilar clarity, restricted and inhibited by thevarious factors we’ve reviewed here - most sociallyand culturally external, but some self-imposed. Inprincipal if not yet in practice, these impedimentshave now been removed. The entire experienceof one’s existence is now an open gate.F. IlluminAnXAppendix #2 discusses the origins, history, andsignificance of the Rose-Cross sigil. AMORCexplains its old emblem: “The cross symbolicallyrepresents the human body and the rose representsthe individual’s unfolding consciousness.” 159But what we have seen here is that the theatre ofRHP initiation extends far beyond mere human159 https://www.rosicrucian.org/history- 224 -mind/body, and that the Roman death-by-torturecross, despite El-Christianity’s ghoulish fascinationwith it, is hardly a positive emblem for the livinghuman body.The rose as a flower is similarly problematical. Inantiquity it usually symbolized secrecy [as in “subrosa”], but also imminent death per a bud’sblooming just before it expires.And of course it may be that the originalEuropean concept was nothing more than anotherexpression of German Lutheranism.But as we have reawakened and refreshed theinitiatory vehicle, so it is also possible to similarlybring its emblem to life; that is the exercise ofAppendix #2.For the neteru the Crux Ansata (the “loopedcross” or AnX) was the talisman carried by all ofthem as the font of divine life, and an AnXconstructed to the precise proportions of the GoldenSection emulates the universal ratio of PerfectBeauty Φ.It is given the radiance of a roseate blush tocontinue that symbolism: “The Blood is the Life.” 160Thus does the Egyptian Rose-Cross change thesigil of Rosicrucianisn from Death to Life.G. TerminusThis lecture series brings to a culmination theresearch project sponsored by the Department ofMetaphysics, Miskatonic University, made possibleby a generous grant from the Starry WisdomFoundation of Providence, Rhode Island.160 Count Dracula, in Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897).- 225 -I would like to further acknowledge my gratitudeto the Esoteric Order of Dagon for inviting andsponsoring this series of lectures at the Order ofDagon Hall in Innsmouth these past several weeks.It is to the Order’s credit that it takes such interestin subject matter which is only peripherally relevantto its members’ lives and priorities.It remains only to assemble these lecture notesinto publishable form for a book, which I hope youwill value as a memento of our presentations anddiscussions here. Are there any final questions?- 226 -- 227 -Appendix #1:AMORC Online Forum PostAugust 7, 2016- by Michael A. Aquino I°Hi Dameon161,You’ve cited one of the two problems withconventional concepts of reincarnation - the obviouscompounding of souls far in excess of the Earth’scurrent body-population. The other objection is theapparent blanking of the individual’s memory, sothat he/she has to start all over again each time.Most occultists [and reincarnations religions] dealwith these annoying issues by just ignoring them/sweeping them under the rug.Actually there is a very clear and straightforwardanswer, as the ancient Egyptians knew andexplained quite matter-of-factly within theirwritings, art, and architecture. The first step inunderstanding it requires an examination into theactual constitution of the “soul”. [I don’t like thatterm, since it is far too crude and carries with it agreat deal of misleading baggage from conventionalreligions. I prefer the term MindStar, which is thetitle of my book on this topic, in case you want thereally long version of what I’ll try to summarizehere.]Humans normally equate the “soul” with“consciousness”, also a sloppy term. Most people are161 Dmeon Keller I°, who had asked these previously-unanswered questions concerning reincarnation.- 228 -aware of themselves as a constant experience andreinforcement of in/outputs of the five physicalsenses. This doesn’t take any effort, of course. Blankit all out, as in physical death or anæsthesia, and youare supposedly snuffed out like a candle. Exceptthat, as the Egyptians realized, you’re not.Plato devotes his Dialogue Meno to an expositionand demonstration of anamnesis: the faculty that,as sentient beings have lived previously/eternally,their knowledge of the Forms ( neteru) - creative,organizing, and preserving Principles of theObjective Universe - is also permanent, recallablethrough the exercise of dialectic. Through thismental discipline, the conscious mind is inspiredthrough progressively more precise questioning todiscard later, coarser, inaccurate concepts in favor oftheir pure, original substance and clarity.The key of anamnesis came down to Plato fromEgypt through Pythagoras. As Dr. Raghavan Iyer 162summarizes:162 D. Phil. Oxford University, Professor Emeritus of PoliticalScience, University of California, Member of the Club of Rome,President of the Institute of World Culture, Santa Barbara,California. Generally regarded as the world’s preeminentauthority on Plato during his lifetime.[index-229_1.jpg][index-229_2.png]- 229 -Thus the soul, since it is immortal and hasbeen born many times, and has seen all thingsboth here and in the other world, has learnedeverything that is. So we need not be surprised if itcan recall the knowledge of virtue or anything elsewhich, as we see, it once possessed. All nature isakin, and the soul has learned everything, so thatwhen a man has recalled a single piece ofknowledge--learned it, in ordinary language--thereis no reason why he should not find out all the rest,if he keeps a stout heart and does not grow wearyof the search, for seeking and learning are in factnothing but recollection.- Plato, MenoAnamnesis is the true soul-memory, intermittentaccess to the divine wisdom within every human being- 230 -as an immortal spectator. All self-conscious monadshave known over immemorial time a vast host ofsubjects and objects, modes and forms, an ever-changing universe. Assuming a complex series of rolesas an essential part of the endless process of learning,the soul becomes captive recurrently to myriad formsof maya and moha, illusion and delusion. At the sametime the soul has the innate and inward capacity tocognize that is is more than any and all of these masks.As every incarnated being manifests a poor, palecaricature of himself - a small, self-limiting, andinverted reflection of one’s nœtic and creativepotential - the ancient doctrine of anamnesis is vital tocomprehend human nature and its hiddenpossibilities. Given the fundamental truth that allhuman beings have played many parts, initiatingdiverse actions in intertwined chains of causation, itnecessarily follows that everyone has the moral andmaterial environment from birth to death which isneeded for self-correction and self-education. But whois it that has this need?Not the shadowy self or false egoity which merelyreacts to external stimuli. Rather there is that Eye ofWisdom in every person which in deep sleep is fullyawake and which has a translucent awareness of self-consciousness as pure, primordial light.That’s the easy part.How then can each “soul” find and see itself,since it is a singularity which each individual cannot“get outside of”? This harks back to philosopherssuch as Descartes, who sought, one might sayQuixotically, to “prove” their conscious existence.“Proof” is of necessity external, as discussed above,so Descartes’ famous Cogito Ergo Sum (I think,therefore I am) is futile: It is impossible to describea “thought” which is not the composite of externalsensory input.No, conceptual thought (Kant’s “pure reason”,Plato’s nœsis, Nietzsche’s “horizon building”) begins- 231 -from the pure, unsupported apprehension of one’sconscious self as an existential reality: the ba ofancient Egypt, the psyche of the Greeks, the GoldenFlower of the Tao.We are now in a position to identify the elementsor “emanations” of the MindStar as the Egyptiansapprehended them. This is not a mere recitation forbemusement. It is a doorway, a map, by which theindividual can redirect the power of discretionaryconsciousness to its source, purification, andrealization of immortality.Each of the following eight emanations proceedsfrom the [more] OU-linked to the [more] SU-linked.Predictably this makes the more basic ones thatmuch easier to identify based on their familiar, ifsubconscious OU-usage. A comparison may be madeto Plato’s “pyramid of thought”, which in hisDialogues he stratified as Eikasia (primitiveemotion), Pistis (ordinary active/reactive thinking),Dianoia (precise, logical, enlightened thought), andNœsis (intuition and apprehension of the UltimateGood ( Agathon).The Egyptian priesthoods knew that each livingcreature was possessed of several existence-emanations above and beyond the metabolic mind/body. All sentient beings possess the first four ( khat,ren, khabit, ab). Beings endowed with the Gift of Set(awareness of isolate self-consciousness) the nexttwo ( ba, ka) as well as in those of initiatory capacityand attainment the next one ( sekhem), and inunique instances the ultimate one ( akh).- 232 -Accordingly each of the following expositions ismeant not just as something to be read, but as apersonal application exercise. Upon being alerted toeach emanation, redirect your thought “inward”until you find and recognize it in yourself. You maybe surprised at how effortless this is.1. KhatThe body-emanation. The khat is integral withthe being’s physical body, and is the original of whatlater, lesser cultures would represent as the “energybody”, “body of light”, “astral body”, etc. In currentfield theory it constitutes the life-field of the person,controlling and directing its material counterpart’sorganization, regeneration, and span of existence.During physical life it is coextensive with itsmaterial counterpart. After material death it mayremain with the corpse to serve as a medium for theother emanations, or it may merely linger near itsremains. Jungians perceived the khat as the“earthbound” anima, and in the oriental vision ofthe Golden Flower it was known as the kuei:Tao the undivided, Great One, gives rise to twoopposite reality principles, Darkness and Light, yinand yang. These are at first thought of only as forces ofnature apart from man. Later the sexual polarities, andothers as well, are derived from them. From yin comesK’un, the receptive feminine principle; from yangcomes Ch’ien, the creative masculine principle. Fromyin comes ming (life); from yang comes hsing(essence).Each individual contains a central monad which,at the moment of conception, splits into life andessence ( ming and hsing). These two are super-individual principles and so can be related to eros andlogos.In the personal bodily existence of the individualthey are represented by two other polarities, a p’o soul- 233 -(or anima) and a hun soul (or animus). All during thelife of the individual these two are in conflict, eachstriving for mastery. At death they separate and godifferent ways. The anima sinks to earth as kuei, aghost-being.It is the khat which is drawn into or activatedfrom within a corpse in necromantic magicalworkings. As one may surmise, the khat is also thevehicle for the zombie practices of Voodoo. The khatis also what non-Initiates imagine to be the “entiresoul” hence the thing that is reincarnated in anotherbody. From this discussion you can see how utterlyignorant and impossible [per the two “objections”initially identified] this supposition is.2. RenThe name-emanation. The Egyptiansunderstood the power of names to identify, define,protect, and empower individuals - mostconspicuously in the various names taken by eachpharaoh. Collectively and separately each nameaffected the very essence of the person, and thegreatest curse [as also illustrated in literature andfilm] was to be denied all names.Externally a name can be used to summon orcompel, whether physically incarnate or not. Theneteru also have the power and the discretion to givenames as well as take them, and through suchnames to take form and voice.- 234 -3. KhabitThe shadow-emanation. This is theconnection of the still-incarnate khat with the life-forces of the natural neteru, enabling it to functionas the organizing and controlling energy (theindividual “life-field”). If the khabit is destroyed, thelife-field de-energizes and the physical body expires.In Black Magic the khabit can also be sent out by itsowner as an instrument of influence upon others.After the physical body is destroyed or no longerneeded, the khabit becomes an avatar of the neterAnubis, overseeing guidance of the [noninitiate]consciousness through the incoherence of the Tuatinto the stabilization of Amenti. An initiatedconsciousness needs no such guidance.4. AbThe heart-emanation. The physical locus ofindividual identity and consciousness, hence thebridge between the Objective Universe of the neteruand the Subjective Universe of the four metaphysicalemanations. It is through the ab that an individualrealizes and recognizes incarnate identity anduniqueness, and following destruction/expiration ofone’s body it is through the ab that one can reenterthe OU [as a “ghost”, through “possession” (moreprecisely merger with another, incarnate ab), orthrough thought-transference].It is also in the ab that the strength and qualityof one’s maat (inclination to “good” or “evil”)reposes. This is echoed in the later Indianmythologies of karma, and was the reason for the- 235 -posthumous “weighing of the heart against afeather” in Egypt. After bodily death the maatwithin the ab overwhelms it completely, so that anysubsequent manifestation in the OU is likely to bean extreme concentration of either beneficence ormalevolence.5. BaThe core-emanation. This is each sentientbeing’s sense of self-awareness, of unique andabsolute distinction from everything else (both othersentient beings and the entire OU).The ba becomes stronger through increased self-exploration and realization, and it is here that theindividual faces a choice between the Horus-path ofharmonious MindStar melding with the naturalneteru (the OU), or the Set-path of ultimate, isolateself consciousness. [The former is obviously far saferand easier, and is the curriculum of AMORC. Non-initiates, unable or unwilling to raise the ba toAMORC levels of awareness and application, dimlyimagine it as “Heaven” and suppose it attainableonly ignorantly and passively through “redemption”and “Grace”.]The anamnesis or “remembered knowledge”experienced by the slave boy in Plato’s Meno isperhaps more accurately described as the physical-process, stimulus/response brain reaching in to theba for bits of its immortal, eternal wisdom. But thisis akin to reaching for a coal in a hot fire. It isstressful to do, and the result can be held only for afleeting moment without further stress. Thesuperficial/physical “self”, which through material- 236 -“hits” continuously reassures itself that it is the onlyself, is shaken by exposure to its falseness, itsnothingness. It backs away from such “closeencounters”, dismisses them as “illusions”,“fantasy”, “imagination”, etc., and hastens to rebuildits fortress of material-sensation walls.The Horus- ba simply continues as one’s sense ofidentity, thus the “essential self” around which all ofthe other emanations coalesce and recognizethemselves. Within noninitiates this results in the babeing sensed as a dreamy, meditative “state ofbeing” which, if indulged in with persistence andintensity, leads to its overwhelming the otheremanations, hence “nirvana” and similar states ofba-ecstasy.6. KaThe transmigration-emanation. The ka isthe complete mirror-image of all eight natural andnon-natural emanations, fused into an avatar,Doppelgänger, or Horla, a completely metaphysicalremanifestation of oneself which can exist anddisplace without limit, both within the SU generatedby one’s ba and within the OU of the natural neteruas well.It is the ka that, through the ab, enters the OUthrough “identity gates” such as pictures or statuesof the individual, or utterance of the individual’sname(s) (the ren), as well as through conducivelocales such as temples and geological &architectural anomalies.- 237 -While the ba may, particularly posthumously,lose awareness of itself through the paradoxicalexpansion of that consciousness into its entireperceptive field, the ka remains immortally finite,distinct, and otherness-separate. Thus in anexpressive, active sense it becomes the externally-identifiable individual beyond physical death.Nowhere is the ka better illustrated than ininitiate Bram Stoker’s The Jewel of Seven Stars.Film treatments of this work, such as Hammer’sBlood from the Mummy’s Tomb and the morerecent The Awakening, have done it a grotesquedisservice. In Stoker’s original text it is in no sense ahorror story, but rather a fascinating and romanticmystery: Who was Tera of ancient Egypt, thismarvelous sorceress-queen who took with her to hertomb only a ruby scarab inscribed with theconstellation of the Thigh of Set (our “Great Bear”)and the hieroglyphs mer (love) and men ab(patience)? Listen to the words of the woman of ourown era with whose ka Tera came gently to merge:[index-238_1.jpg][index-238_2.png]- 238 -I can see her in her loneliness and in the silence ofher mighty pride, dreaming her own dream of thingsfar different from those around her. Of some otherland, far away under the canopy of the silent night, litby the cool, beautiful light of the stars. A land underthat Northern star, whence blew the sweet winds thatcooled the feverish desert air. A land of wholesomegreenery, far, far away. Where were no scheming andmalignant priesthood; whose ideas were to lead topower through gloomy temples and more gloomycaverns of the dead, through an endless ritual of death!A land where love was not base, but a divinepossession of the soul! Where there might be some onekindred spirit which could speak to hers through- 239 -mortal lips like her own; whose being could mergewith hers in a sweet communion of soul to soul, evenas their breaths could mingle in the ambient air! Iknow the feeling, for I have shared it myself. I mayspeak of it now, since the blessing has come into myown life. I may speak of it since it enables me tointerpret the feelings, the very longing soul, of thatsweet and lovely Queen, so different from hersurroundings, so high above her time! Whose nature,put into a word, could control the forces of the UnderWorld; and the name of whose aspiration, though butgraven on a star-lit jewel, could command all thepowers in the Pantheon of the High Gods. And in therealisation of that dream she will surely be content torest!In Love and Patience we are taught the secret oftrue immortality - not the repulsive reanimation ofcorpses ( anastasis nekron) of Christianity, nor thevague confusion of exoteric reincarnationists - butthe infinite radiance of one’s MindStar by its mostmagnificent expression, and with a serenetranscendence of natural time.The last two emanations are unique in that theymust arise from the individual, and require initiateconsciousness to do so, per the formula XeperaXeper Xeperu (”I Have Come Into Being andCreated That Which Has Come Into Being.”).7. SekhemThe neter-emanation. While the term sekhemis ordinarily translated as “power”, this ismisleading, because it is power in a very rarifiedsense - that emanating from the neteru themselves.For this reason it is also described as “the power ofthe stars” through which the neteru manifest in theOU. The sekhem combines with the ab (as, in effect,- 240 -a temple within one’s consciousness), to draw downthe essence of one or more adored neteru to indwelltherein.Activation of the sekhem has another effect:every incidence infuses the Initiate with more of theneter invoked, to the cumulative degree that theInitiate’s personality becomes accented by theneter’s: seeing as that neter sees, speaking as thatneter would speak, acting as that neter would act.Hence it is the sekhem which makes possible, andultimately consecrates priesthood of a neter in theindividual so aligned. Once this transformation hastaken place, it cannot be undone; at most it may besublimated or repressed, but only at great cost to thepriest’s or priestess’ very sanity.8. AkhThe star-emanation. Beyond the priesthood ofthe sekhem is the akh, in which the Initiate rises tothe company of the neteru as one of their essence, ifnot of them absolutely. Such one is indistinguishablefrom the actual neteru except by the neteruthemselves. Such a mode of existence departscompletely from all concern with physicaldisplacement [within OUl references or boundaries,manifestation, or action, and affects otherness onlyby the radiance of its presence. While it does notdestroy any of the other emanations, it permeates allof them, such that henceforth they all exist inconformity and concert with it.So your actual adventure of continued, immortalconsciousness past the cast-off of your temporaryOU-body has absolutely nothing to do with crude,- 241 -conventional “bodily reincarnation” superstitions.Non-initiates either relax into khat-unconsciousnessor a passive ba-state similar to ordinary dreaming.Initiates who become aware of the completeMindStar complex can explore and actualize it inwhole or part, eternally and universally. Uponentering AMORC, as Obi-wan Kenobi said to LukeSkywalker in Star Wars, “You have just taken yourfirst step into a larger universe.”- 242 -[index-243_1.jpg][index-243_2.jpg]- 243 -Appendix #2:From Rose-Cross to IlluminAnX- by Michael A. Aquino I°Symbols do not represent the thing itself, theactual phenomenon. It would also be wrong to thinkthat they are purely and simply schematic formulæ. Inoperational research the model is not a small-scale orsimplified model of a known object; it is a possibleapproach to, or means of getting to know this object.And it is outside reality, in the mathematical universe.The next requirement is that the analogicalmachine constructed on this model should enter intoan electronic trance so that it can give practicalanswers. This is why all the usual occultistexplanations of symbols are useless. They look uponsymbols as if they were schemas that can beinterpreted by intelligence at its normal level and solead immediately to an apprehension of reality. Forcenturies they have been treating in this way the St.Andrew’s cross, the swastika, and the star of Solomon,but have contributed nothing to a study of theprofound structure of the universe.- 244 -Einstein, with his sublime intelligence, was able, ina flash of illumination, to catch a glimpse of the space/t i m e r e l a t i o n s h i p , b u t w i t h o u t c o m p l e t e l yunderstanding or integrating it into his scheme ofthings. To communicate his discovery at an intelligiblelevel, and to help him recapture his own illuminatingvision, he drew the sign λ representing the trihedralangle.This sign is not a schema of reality and meansnothing to the mass of mankind. It is a signal, arallying cry to all workers in the field of mathematicalphysics. And yet all the progress made in this field bythe greatest intellects will only succeed in discoveringwhat this trihedral symbol evokes, but will not be ableto penetrate the universe where the law of which thissymbol is an expression actually operates. At least, atthe end of this forward march, we shall know that thisother universe exists. 163The Rose Cross has always struck me as an oddand indeed contradictory symbol for Rosicrucianidentification and initiation, especially of theEgyptian-accented AMORC.AMORC explains the emblem: “The crosssymbolically represents the human body and therose represents the individual’s unfoldingconsciousness.” 164Except that both are actually ancient symbols ofquite other things. The cross, which has nosignificant pre- or other-use, is inescapably a symbolof Christianity, more particularly the tortureinstrument of Jesus’ execution. Hardly a positivesymbol, even for Christians. It does not approximatethe human body parts, except as they can be nailedto it.163 Pauwels, Louis & Bergier, Jacques, The Morning of theMagicians. New York: Avon, 1963.164 https://www.rosicrucian.org/history[index-245_1.jpg][index-245_2.jpg]- 245 -In antiquity roses were originally portrayed inwhite, traditionally also the color of wisdom andinitiation, and specifically with five petals, alludingto the sacred 5-principle of the Pythagoreans. 165The two most famous explanations for red rosesare that (1) rushing to the dying Adonis, Aphroditepricked her foot on a rosebush, staining the flowerswith her blood; (2) dripping blood from the crucifiedJesus fell onto a rosebush beneath, staining themred [the connection of the red rose specifically withthe cross]. Again an inescapable symbol of sacrificialdeath.When a white rose is placed on the Christiancross, this identifies it as Lutheran, although therose is overlaid with a red heart and an additionalcross:165 About which more below in the discussion of Φ.[index-246_1.jpg][index-246_2.jpg][index-246_3.jpg][index-246_4.jpg]- 246 -The rose is also a symbol of secrecy, as in theRoman custom of placing roses over a never-to-be-repeated discussion, hence the phrase sub rosa. TheU.S. Army’s Military Intelligence Branchincorporates the rose (again with its ancient five-petals) in its emblem (with the cross replaced by acompass and a dagger):So a combination of two symbols of sacrificialdeath on the Spanish-style cross associated with theInquisition and in America of Francisco Vàsquez deCoronado’s expeditions of conquest against Native[index-247_1.jpg][index-247_2.jpg][index-247_3.jpg][index-247_4.jpg]- 247 -Americans is not especially flattering toRosicrucianism.The AMORC’s rose is multi-petaled, discardingthe Pythagorean 5-principle, and it surrounds therose cross with an oval and an inverse equilateraltriangle:The inverse/downward-pointing triangle is thesymbol for water in alchemy, and in Tantra for thefeminine sexual principle, as is a vertical oval. Weaccordingly confront a curious combination ofsacrificial death and secrecy within female sexuality.While arguably an interesting meditative concept,- 248 -this would not seem to be appropriate or magicallyconducive to the course of initiation that AMORCpursues.Shapes and colors have an effect upon the viewernot just at the æsthetic level, but as disturbancesand distortions of the electromagnetic spectrum.Colors act as gates and filters for light waves, whileshapes either smooth or shatter them. There aremany specialized fields of scientific research in thisgeneral area, but for this paper a brief glimpseshould suffice:Everything would be simple if we were limited tothe colors of the rainbow. But besides the seven visiblecolor-vibrations (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow,orange, red), the spectrum includes five invisible ones(infrared, black, negative green, white, ultraviolet).Belizal and Morel write that ‘in the sector betweenblack and white there are many other vibratory pointsrevealing great energy. This is an intensely radioactivezone whose center lies in negative green, which is theexact antipode of the green of the spectrum, or positivegreen.’ And they conclude: ‘It is the shortest and mostpowerful vibration in the universe.’I will add that it is also the most dangerous. Withgreen we are at the borderline between good and evil,the visible and the invisible. Both positive andnegative, it is the most mysterious of all colors, theonly one that is exactly opposed to itself. In any case itgreatly complicates efforts to assign responsibility forthe inexplicable harmful forces that contaminate somehouses.* * *The subject of colors provides a reasonabletransition to the difficult and controversial problem ofshape waves.All the harmful rays I have mentioned so far canbe detected and measured by scientific devicessensitive to microvibrations and electromagnetism.They correspond to gamma rays, which are similar toX-rays. It has been established that the shorter theirwavelength is, the more harmful they are, and thatthey are extremely hard. It is precisely because of this- 249 -hardness that they can so easily penetrate livingtissues. In human beings and animals they destroy redcorpuscles; in plants they attack the sap. They are thusresponsible for a progressive disintegration of thehuman race. It can be said without exaggerating thatthe end of the world is near if man neglects to protecthimself from the malignant rays that criss-cross theuniverse. Fortunately, as we have seen, it is possible toassure such protection by relatively simple means.Provided these dangerous rays have a kind ofphysiochemical plausibility, it is easy to convincepeople they exist. Since the idea of radioactivity is nowfamiliar to everyone, it can be understood by analogythat there are cosmic and telluric waves which havedetrimental effects on human beings. But it will bemuch harder for me to make my readers take meseriously when I say that by drawing twoperpendicular lines with a point in common, we obtainthe shortest and most powerful vibration in theuniverse, the one I have already mentioned inconnection with colors: negative green.These vibrations produced by a right angle areshape waves, that is, waves engendered by shapes astheir name implies.When they are emitted by symmetrical geometricalshapes, they are favorable to the equilibrium of livingorganisms. They are unfavorable when they come fromshapes that are irregular, non-compensated, ordissociated to project malignant energy.We have here come to the impassable no-man’sland that separates science from magic.If it is true, as I believe, that this vibration iscreated by angular refraction, it is easy to imagine thesuperhuman power wielded by someone capable ofaiming, wherever and however he chooses, theformidable artillery of shape waves contained in anordinary geometry textbook. 166In short, if you ignorantly or carelessly constructan artifact or even a supposedly two-dimensionaldesign, or use certain uncompensated colors, you166 Roger de Lafforest, Houses That Kill.

The malignancy of theChristian cross has less to do with its death/torturehistory than it does with its incorporation of 12 90°angles in 2D and 48 in 3D. No wonder CountDracula averts his gaze!A summary of the significance of Φ is nowpertinent, for which the pentagram is particularlyuseful:The pentagram is one of the most ancientsymbols known to mankind, dating fromprehistory. 167 It is significant mathematically in thatit precisely embodies the ratio Φ ( phi), as the ratio167 William Arnett’s The Predynastic Origin of EgyptianHieroglyphs (1982) shows that the pentagram existed side-by-side with the five-line star, which became common use in theprotodynastic Naquada region. Five-pointed stars were foundat Gerza and Tarkhan, all Upper or Middle Egyptianprotodynastic sites. The Tarkhan has a five-pointed star in acircle attached to a boat - one of the first signs of the journeythrough the Tuat. Arnett dates all of these to 3500 BCE. - D.Webb- 251 -between any longer and shorter line section withinthe pentagram . 168 169In ancient Egypt Φ was known as the Sacred Cut.It was employed in all important construction andartwork. For instance, one-half the base of the GreatPyramid divided into the apothem equals Φ accurateto 4 significant figures. 170The Greeks too used Φ in art and architecture,naming it the Golden Mean or Golden Section. 171 A“Golden Rectangle”, where the Φ ratio is equal totherelationship between the longer and shorterdimensions, appears in the works of artistsLeonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, and GeorgeSeurat. In 1876 Gustav Fechner, a Germanpsychiatrist, conducted experiments which168 The concept and significance of Φ may be studied at lengthin H.E. Huntley’s The Divine Proportion and PriyaHemenway’s Divine Proportion: Φ phi in Art, Nature, andScience.169 The lines of the pentagram reflect the Golden Mean. Eachinside angle of the central pentagon is 108°. Each inside angleof the five points is 36°. Every line segment of the pentagramdivided by the next shorter segment yields:sin 108°-------- =1.618033988749894848204586834365638117720309180…sin 36°170 Assuming that the base to be 440 cubits and the apothem356 cubits, then the apothem divided by 1/2 the base yields:356---------- = 1.6181818…440 x .5171 This entire idea seems to have died with the fall of ancientGreek civilization; it was not rediscovered until the 16thcentury, when Lucas Picioli published Divina proportione withillustrations by Leonardo da Vinci.- 252 -concluded that the vast majority of people“preferred” rectangles in this shape.Φ also appears in nature. Most spiral growth innature, notably phyllotaxis (the growth of leaves andflowers), follows the Fibonacci series, where eachnumber in the series is equal to the sum of the twopreceding numbers, ie: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... Asthis series continues, the relationship betweensuccessive numbers approaches Φ. 172The Sacred Cut (or Golden Section) divides a lineinto unequal sections where the smaller is to thelarger as the larger is to the whole. Similarly, aGolden Rectangle is one which, when divided into asquare and smaller rectangle, the smaller rectangleis also a Golden Rectangle. Or, algebraically,Φ2=Φ+1. 173This, then, is the “secret” of the pentagram - afact overlooked completely by most occult“authorities” of history. All “magic pentangles” -generally embellished with Cabalistic graffiti of onesort or another - amount to an unconscious effort to172 The Fibonacci series was named after mathematicianLeonardo Pisano Fibonacci . The 23rd number of this series is28,657, the 24th; 46,368;46,368--------- = 1.618033988205328,657173 Some further properties of Φ:1 + Φ = Φ 2; Φ + Φ 2 = Φ 3; Φ 2 + Φ 3= Φ 4; ad infinitum.Φ = (1 + √(5)) / 2Φ = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/...)))))...Φ = (sec 72)/2 =(csc 18)/2 = 1/(2 cos 72) = 1/(2 sin 18) = 2 sin54 = 2 cos 36 = 2/(csc 54) = 2/ (sec 36)[index-253_1.png][index-253_2.jpg]- 253 -use the innate power of the pentagram even thoughnot recognizing it for what it actually is.Which brings this discussion back to the symbolof Rosicrucianism. The following exercise eliminatesall of the identified negative, misleading, andharmful factors, and replaces the Christian cross ofdeath with the Egyptian cross of the neteru, the anχ.The anχ not only identified those holding it asneteru, but signified the divine life emanating fromthem. But for the AMORC I am going to constructnot just any anχ, but a Φ anχ.First we take a Golden Rectangle and subdivide itinto four internal Golden Rectangles:Next we construct an anχ to fit precisely into theGolden Rectangles:[index-254_1.png][index-254_2.jpg][index-254_3.png][index-254_4.jpg]- 254 -And finally we remove the Golden Rectangles,leaving an anχ embodying Φ in all of itscomponents, as well as in its overall proportion:So much for the “cross”; now what about the“rose”? Again, overlaying the anχ with anythingwould compromise its integrity and power. So thesolution is color. I propose the delicate translucentcrystalline blush hue of rose quartz (which I canonly approximate here).
